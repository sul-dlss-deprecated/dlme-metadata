Foreign Secret. Your telegram of 10th June. Bagdad Railway negotia tions. Our conditions as to Katr represent in our opinion the irreducible minimum leaving no margin for surrender. We feel strongly the necessity of the removal of the Turkish troops altogether from the Peninsula as we nave no confidence that iurkish Government will adhere to any conditions imposed however rigidly defined. We can suggest no concession that can be made with safety to British and Indian interests and we would prefer to see the negotiations broken off rather than any concession made to Turkey m the Gulf. Any step tending to consolidate position of Turks on the littoral of the Persian Gulf should in our interests be strenuouslv opposed— (t @ From Viceroy, 2hth March 1911. .—hollowing are our views in reply to questions contained in last paragraph hut one of your telegram dated 18th March, regarding Koweit obligations extend, in our opinion, to the limits of territory of VD i f th' iru! i • (2.) do the best of our knowledge, Jjorimer has fairly accurately defined the limits of that territory, especially as regards portion to the north. (3.) Retention of Bubiyan and Warba for the Sheikh is regarded by us as important. Repeated representations were made to the Turkish Government on subject of Turkish action in occupying Bubiyan in 1902, which was a departure from their engagement to maintain status quo. India Office was moreover informed in November 1907 that, in Sir E. Grey's' opinion, Shellih s jui isdiction over Bubiyan should, on grounds stated by Government of India with so much force, be resolutely supported by tlis Majesty's Government. It should be remembered, with regard to Warba island, that right of pre-emption in sale or lease of entire island and its surrounding foreshore was secured by us from Sheikh in our agreement with him concluded in 1907. J his cannot fail to be regarded by Sheikh as an admission by us of his claims to Warba,. We could, not, press Sheikh's claims to Um Kasr, which are shadowy.

Reference is invited to final sentence of my telegram dated, the 3rd instant. Please let me have your views as to participation without control, provided that Koweit is absolutely secured in sense of your telegram dated the 23rd ultimo. You)' observations are solicited on following points :— (1.) Do you consider that by agreeing to enhanced Customs for fixed periods only, condition being made that no differential rates shall be imposed, we might secure equal treatment for British trade ? (2.) Does it matter, from commercial point of view, whether we have 20 or 40 per cent, share, if we are not to have control 2 (30 Will not being left out altogether involve greater loss of prestige to us than getting only 20 per cent ? Apparently the alternative is to stand out and to endeavour to make use of Customs increase to buy out claims of Turks in Gulf and at Koweit. Basra will in that case presumably be the terminus, and we must rely for our trade with Western Persia on line from Khorremabad to Mohammerah, if we get it. Bagdad railway will however still be built, supposing no friendly arrangement is reached, and as Turkish power consolidates difficulty of continuing our good o ffices to Sheikh will be increased. Reference is invited, in regard to Koweit itself, to fifth paragraph of Memorandum dated 2lst March 1902, by Lord Lansdowne, copy of which was enclosed in letter of Wth April 1902 from Secretary, Political Department, India Office, to Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department Please let me have your definition of region to which our obligation extends, or please say whether general description of boundaries on page 1059, &amp;c , of Persian Gidf Gazetteer has your acceptance. Do Bubiyan and Warba cease to matter in event of Bunder Shweikh being railway terminus? Presumably no claim can be made to Um Kasr.

India Office to Foreign Office.—{Received June 11.) Sir, India Office, June 10, 1912. I AM directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, dated the 30th May, 1912. Arrangements, as Sir E. Grey is aware, have already been made for the proposed inter-departmental conference. As regards the question of participation, I am to say that the Marquess of Crewe is not convinced by the arguments in your letter in support of the proposal which, as appears from the aide-memoire presented to Sir E. Grey on the 15th April, 1912 (see also the fourth paragraph of section {a) of the joint memorandum by Sir A. Hirtzel and Mr. Parker, dated the 24th April, 1912), the Turkish Government have in effect rejected ; and, as the Turkish Government have rejected it, he is at a loss to under stand why it is a “ subversive departure from the rules of diplomatic procedure ” to revert to proposals already submitted in principle to the Turkish Government, whose alternative to them has been found inacceptable by His Majesty’s Government. Two matters of fact mentioned in your letter call for some comment. Lord Crewe was not aware that an assurance, which appears to him to tie to a considerable extent the hands of His Majesty’s Government, had been given to the Turkish Ambassador that no negotiation or discussion in connection with the Bagdad Railway would be conducted with the German Government. Nor had his Lordship been informed that it was in consequence of the inability of His Majesty’s Government to obtain a 50 per cent, participation for British interests that the proposals now before the Ottoman Government were made. The reasons for the change in their policy are not on record, and he does not remember to have seen any indication that an attempt had been unsuccessful!}' made to obtain a 50 per cent, participation ; on the contrary, it appeared from Sir E. Grey’s despatches No. 123, dated the Oth April, 1911, to Sir F. Bertie, and No. 105, dated the 10th April, 1911, to Sir G. Buchanan, that France and Russia at all events would offer no serious objection, while Sir G. Lowther’s despatch No. 328, dated the 12th May, 1911, gave reasons why the Turkish share might reasonably be a small one. Germany therefore remained, and if his Lordship is correct in understanding your letter to mean that Germany has been approached and has refused, his suggestion was, of course, beside the point. With reference to the opinion of the Viceroy quoted in your letter, 1 am directed to enclose copy of a further telegram* which has been received from his Excellency on the subject, and in which Lord Crewe concurs. I am to add that both telegrams are of a private nature, and to ask that they may not be quoted again in official communications or included in any printed collection of official papers. As regards El Katr, I am to say that the proposals of His Majesty’s Government for a settlement of the Persian Gulf questions were very carefully prepared after an inter-departmental conference, were part of the papers submitted to the Standing Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, and were in substance approved by that body. There was no suggestion at the time that they contained any superfluous demands to be given away in negotiation, or that they were other than what was believed to be the irreducible minimum which His Majesty’s Government could with due regard to their interests accept. Lord Crewe will consider whether from the Indian point of view they can be modified, but he does not expect to find any material alteration practicable. In connection with El Katr especially, I am to invite attention to section 3 of the report of the Standing Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, dated the 14th July, 1911. A copy of a telegram, dated the 10th June, 1912, addressed to the Government of India on this subject, is enclosed. His Lordship notes Sir E. Grey’s decision with regard to Mohammerah, which has doubtless been taken after consideration of the Government of India s telegram, * Not printed.—- gOTa.- -—— dated the 24th May, copy of which was furnished to your department on the 25th May. I am to add, with reference to the last paragraph of your letter, that, while Lord Crewe would wish to be consulted before any concessions are made to Turkey, he must regard the form of the negotiations and the procedure to be adopted as matters pertaining to the Foreign Office. I am, &amp;c. R. RITCHIE. r Enclosure in No. 1. The Marquess of Crewe to Government of India. (Telegraphic.) P. India Office, June 10, 1912. NEGOTIATIONS regarding Bagdad Railway. I request that you will consider, on basis of the memorandum of the 29th July last to Turkish Government, the reply of the Porte, and the joint minute by Mr. Parker and Sir A. Hirtzel, what concessions, should such prove necessary to save negotiations, you would be prepared to make to Turkey in territories on the Gulf littoral. J'oreign Office have been informed by me that no stipulations to be waived by way of concession in course of negotiation were included in our conditions regarding El Ivatr, but that those conditions were drafted as statement of necessary minimum. In order to meet situation in event of breakdown of negotiations His Majesty’s Government must clearly be provided with a definite alternative policy.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Govem™*™* ] [A] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. [May 30.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [21766] No. 1. Foreign Office to India Office. Sir, Foreign Office, May 30, 1912. I AM directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter P. 1858 of the 21st instant on the subject of the Bagdad railway and connected questions. Sir E. Grey has read this letter with surprise, which a perusal of former corres pondence has merely served to increase : In the course of last summer lengthy discussions took place between the departments concerned respecting the reply to be sent to the Turkish Ambassador respecting the Bagdad railway and cognate matters ; and, as a result of these discussions, a telegram dated the 13th July, 1911, was dispatched to the Viceroy informing him of the nature of the proposed reply, and, on the 16th July, his Excellency telegraphed that the proposals “ seem satisfactory on the whole and a great advance on those made hitherto,” and, in particular, he stated that the proposed distribution of capital in the Bagdad-Bussorah section of the railway might on certain conditions be accepted ; copies of these telegrams were communicated by the Marquess of Crewe to Sir E. Grey, and it was intimated at the same time that the India Office would furnish an expression of opinion ; a letter dated the 18th July, 1911 was hereupon wu’itten by Sir A. Hirtzel, in which he stated ‘‘I understand that Lord Crewe has spoken to Sir E. Grey about this, and my instructions are to send you the enclosed copy of the Foreign Office memorandum with his Lordship’s suggested alterations shown in manuscript,” all the suggested alterations were incorporated in this document, which was the draft of the proposed reply to the Turkish Ambassador, in so far as it related to the Bagdad railway, and it was not until that reply had been submitted to Lord Crewe and initialled by his Lordship that it was dispatched. Such being the sequence of events, Sir E. Grey learns with regret, nine months after the reply has been dispatched and its substance communicated to the French, Russian, and German Governments—an interval during which no intimation of his Lordship’s change of attitude has reached Sir E. Grey—that Lord Crewe has so far modified his attitude as to regard the distribution of capital proposed as “ wholly unacceptable and even dangerous. Sir E. Grey is unaware of the reasons which have led Lord Crewe to modify his views to so serious an extent as is implied by his letter under reply; but he must point out the very grave objections which exist to withdrawing the offer formally made to the Ottoman Government, after such long and serious consideration, after the lapse of so many months, and at a moment when the Turkish Ambassador has been instructed to discuss the proposals in the most friendly and accommodating spirit. His Majesty’s Government are, in Sir E. Grey's opinion, in honour committed to those proposals, and they must at any rate await their definite rejection before recommencing negotiations on a totally different basis,—negotiations which, it must be remembered, failed on a previous occasion. The reply of the Turkish Ambassador is by no means of a character to warrant so subversive a departure from the rules of diplomatic procedure as a refusal to continue the negotiations would imply, for to demand a participation of 50 per cent, or 60 per cent, at this late stage of the proceedings would be tantamount to open rupture, and would cause great disappointment and apprehension at Constantinople. Moreover, preliminary negotiations with France, Russia, and Germany would be necessary, unless indeed Germany consented at once to forego any share at all in the Bagdad-Bussorah sections, which, in Sir E. Grey s opinion, it would be as unreasonable to ask as it would be difficult to obtain. Assuming that France and Russia were asked to renounce their shares and were excluded, a long and difficult negotiation with Germany would ensue, and a heavy price would have to be paid for her renunciation of a share equal to that of any other foreign Power ; and assuming further that a successful issue were reached, Sir E. Grey apprehends that it is not probable that the resumption of negotiations with the [2-185 gg—l]Ottoman Government would be facilitated, as they would deeply resent the discon tinuance of the present discussion, and the initiation of negotiations between two Powers, England and Germany, one of whom has largely renounced her claims m return for a substantial quid pro quo, the other of whom does not possess any legal claim at all in those regions. , . The Ottoman Government, through the .Turkish Ambassador m Eondon, have requested that no negotiations or discussion in connection with the Bagdad railway should be conducted with the German Government, and His Highness was assured that no such procedure was contemplated. ^ . It was in consequence of the inability of His Majesty’s Government to obtain a 50 per cent, participation for British interests that the proposals now before the Ottoman Government were made ; and Sir E. Grey thinks that one of the reasons then advanced for being satisfied with a smaller participation has been overlooked in your letter under reply. If it be granted that His Majesty s Government can only protect British and Indian trade against adverse treatment by securing a participation of 50 per cent., how are they then to avoid such adverse treatment on other parts of the railway, e.g., on the branch to Khanikin, and if adverse treatment exists on that and other portions of the railway, the utility of securing equality of treatment on the Bagdad-Bussorah sections is not so apparent ? In Sir E. Grey’s view, which, until the receipt of your letter under reply, he believed to be shared by your department, the most efficacious means of excluding differential treatment (not only on the Bagdad-Bussorah sections but on all railways in Asiatic Turkey) is by a binding international agreement on the subject, and by making the continued levy of the increased customs duty dependent on the precise observance of that instrument. For these reasons Sir E. Grey hopes that the Marquess of Crewe will reconsider his views and allow the negotiations with the Turkish Ambassador to pioceed on the basis of the proposals formally made to the Ottoman Government in July 1911. Sir E. Grey would remind Lord Crewe that his Excellency is anxious to discuss those proposals at an early date, and he thinks that a preliminary discussion between the departments concerned should take place as soon as possible. As regards the Peninsula of El Katr, Sir E. Grey naturally attaches the greatest weight to the views of the Marquess of Crewe, and although he is disposed to think that his Lordship’s conclusions as to the result of conceding something to Turkey in this region are exaggerated, he does not think it necessary to continue at this stage the discussion on this point, as he would be averse from abating any of the demands advanced in the memorandum of the 29th July, 1911, for the present; he would, however, be glad if Lord Crewe would consider at his leisuie m what direction it might be possible to make a concession to the Ottoman Government supposing a successful issue of the negotiations depended upon some modification of our extreme demands. If it were worth while to initiate these negotiations, it is worth while to continue them in a reasonable spirit. As to Mohammerah, Sir E. Grey does not consider it practicable to propose to the Persian Government that they should make a communication as proposed to the Turkish Government, or that His Majesty’s Government should support Persia against Turkey in the manner suggested: Sir E. Grey does not consider that it would be possible to reserve this question from The Hague Tribunal if the Turkish Government persisted in such a reference; but, if it is possible to prevent it, Sir E. Grey has no intention of allowing it, and proposes to treat a settlement of this frontier as part of the present negotiations and as a necessary condition of their conclusion. k separate letter will be addressed to you shortly respecting the course which it is proposed to pursue in regard to the Mohammerah frontier negotiations. I am, Ac. LOUIS MALLET.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Govern™^*] [A] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. [May 22.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1, [ 21766 ] No. 1. v India Office to Foreign Office.—(Received May 22.) Sir, India Office, May 21, 1912. I AM directed By the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of yonr letter of the 16th instant on the subject of the Bagdad Railway and connected questions. In reply I am to say that if, after the very full discussions that have already taken place, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs considers that a further inter departmental conference is necessary, the Marquess of Crewe will depute a representative of this Office to attend it. But, personally, he considers it sufficiently established that, regard being had to the magnitude of British interests involved, this country cannot with dignity, or, indeed, with safety, agree to participate on a basis of less than 50 per cent., and he has always regarded the distribution of 60 per cent, between Great Britain, France, and Russia (or between the first two alone) as a wholly unacceptable, and even dangerous, alternative. Further, he holds very strongly the view of his predecessor (see paragraph 9 of Sir R. Ritchie’s letter of the 29th March, 1911) that a friendly agreement with Germany is an essential preliminary to a satisfactory settlement, and I am to suggest that the Bagdad Railway Company and the German Government should at once be approached with a view to such a modification of the declaration of the 7th March, 1911, as would enable this country to participate in the Bagdad-Bussorah branch to an extent more nearly proportionate to our commercial interests in that region.] As regards El Katr, I am to say that, in Lord Crewe’s opinion, an entirely new situation would be created in the Persian Gulf, and one in every way detrimental to British interests, if the Turks were allowed to consolidate themselves there. Such consolidation is, indeed, contradictory of the main object of His Majesty’s Government in attempting a settlement of questions in the Gulf, which was to eliminate Turkish influence as far as possible, and in any case to limit it to the head of the Gulf. That influence in El Hasa has existed only since Midhat Pasha’s expedition in 1871, and may be said to exist at present on sufferance, for so long as the quasi-independence of Koweit is maintained, El Hasa must remain more or less isolated. But the construction of the Bagdad Railway to Bussorah or Koweit will undoubtedly enable the Turkish Government to make their authority much more effective; and the further result of allowing, under the sanction of a convention, the consolidation of Turkish power in the Peninsula of El Katr will, his Lordship thinks, be not only to enable the Turkish Government to extend and establish it in the interior, but also to give them a secure and recognised yoint dapyai within the British sphere of interest. The position of Bahrein—as a kind of British enclave in Turkish territory—will be anomalous and precarious, while the Trucial Coast will become the scene of constant intrigues requiring increased vigilance—and therefore increased expenditure—on the part of His Majesty’s Government to check it. Moreover, the Turkish desire, to intervene jointly with us in the affairs of the Gulf will be strengthened, and will amount to something like a claim if Turkish authority is once recognised and effective. In Lord Crewe’s opinion, no convention, however strictly drawn, can remove these disadvantages. He apprehends that the Turks will always intrigue ; that when taxed with it they will deny it or produce sufficiently plausible excuses; while His Majesty’s Government, with their many commitments elsewhere, will always have sufficient reason for not taking at any given moment an extreme step which would not be the less inconvenient or expensive merely because it happened to be justified by the terms of the convention. The Turkish garrison at El Bidaa—unrecognised for forty years, but, nevertheless, in possession—may, indeed, be regarded as a symbol of British policy in the Persian Gulf. Turning now to Mohammerah, Lord Crewe understands that the ffurks are advancing extravagant claims, in the hope, by subsequent concessions there, of obtaining corresponding advantages elsewhere ; and in your letter under reply the [2485 i/—11fear is expressed that if this hope is not realised, and the case goes to The Hague Tribunal, the result might be even to give to Turkey the line claimed by Dervish Pasha in 1850. Lord Crewe, as at present advised, sees no grounds for such an apprehension. That line was not accepted by the mediating commissioners, and his Lordship imagines that the evidence upon which they rejected it would weigh equally ^ with The Hague Tribunal. Moreover, it is clear that the Turks do not greatly trust* their own evidence, since otherwise they would not contemplate giving the line away in negotiation. It would seem to his Lordship to be more probable that The Hague Tribunal would fix a line approximating to that of the mediating commissioners ; and if the alternatives are to allow the consolidation of Turkish authority in El Katr or to deprive the Sheikh of Mohammerah of the district between the mediating commissioners’ line and the frontier as locally observed, he would choose the latter as the lesser evil. In conclusion, I am to enquire whether Sir E. Grey is satisfied that it is impossible to reserve the rights of Mohammerah as regards any reference to The Hague Tribunal. It does not appear that there has been any material alteration in the status quo between Howeizah and the Shatt-el-Arab since the Treaty of Erzeroum. In other words, there is no case in that region for arbitration, and the situation therefore differs entirely from that on the northern section, where it is precisely the vital nature of the alterations made in recent years that is the cause of the whole difficulty. This essential difference might perhaps be held to justify Persia in informing the Turkish Government (and His Majesty’s Government in supporting her, should necessity arise) that, while there would be no objection to minor rectifications by The Hague Tribunal of the frontier locally recognised as compared with the mediating commissioners’ line, no award substantially modifying it will be accepted. Copy of a telegram addressed to the Government of India is enclosed ; their reply, with any further observations that may be necessary, will be communicated to you in due course. ' - I am, &amp;c.

Foreign Office fear that reference of Turco-Persmn frontier to Hague Tribunal might result in loss of a considerable slice of sheikh’s territory, since Turks are reviving Dervish Pasha’s extravagant claims. Ihey therefore propose to avoid Hague by including Mohammerah in Gulf negotiations and offering Turks consolidation in El Katr in return for locally recognised frontier of Mohammerah. I am inclined to think fears of Hague award rather exaggerated, and that loss to sheikh, if limited to territory west of mediating commissioners’ line, is lesser evil than consolidation of Turks in El Katr. I know your views on latter subject, but should be glad to have your remarks as soon as possible on the above considerations.Ei Ms Document is the Property oi Bis Britannic Majesty's Govern'mcmt j EASTERN DEPARTMENT. [July 29.] SECRET SERIES. ^ Section 1. [28300] No. 1. Memorandum communicated to the Turkish A mbassador, July 29, 1911. (Confidential.) HIS Majesty’s Government have not failed to give their careful attention to the important proposals contained in the memorandum of the 1st March last from the Ottoman Government. These proposals, though they affect interests so closely interwoven that they cannot be settled independently the one of the other, have, for the purpose of convenience, been set forth under three distinct headings :— (i.) The Bagdad Railway question. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. (iii.) An increase from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem in the Turkish customs duties. (i.) The Bagdad Railway Question. On various occasions His Majesty’s Government have indicated the conditions under which they would favour the participation of British capital in this enterprise ; and, while it is not now proposed to recapitulate the earlier stages of this question, it may be recalled that in July 1910, as a result of prolonged discussions with the Ottoman Minister of Finance who was then in London, it was intimated that an arrangement securing to British interests a representation of 55 per cent, of the whole in regard to the Gulf sections of the line might be regarded as a satisfactory solution,—aud, having regard to the great preponderance of certain interests in other sections of the line, such a proportion cannot well be looked upon as excessive, especially if the great extent of British trade in those regions and the vast tonnage of British shipping are borne in mind. Since the arrangement laid before Djavid Bey represented a large measure of concession on the part of His Majesty’s Government, they have received the suggestions now made by the Ottoman Government with some surprise. The Turkish proposals for the final portions of the railway are that a new company should be formed, and that the capital should be divided between the Ottoman Government, who would receive 40 per cent, of the whole, and British, French, and German groups, who would each receive 20 per cent. The details of the financial arrangements are left for subsequent settlement between the parties interested. His Majesty’s Government regret that they are unable to accept these proposals. If a new company is formed for the construction and working of the railway south of Bagdad, and if it is to be constituted upon an international basis, His Majesty’s Government can only accede to such an arrangement provided that British interests are represented in a degree at least equal to that of any other Power including Turkey, and, in order to effect this and with a view to emphasising the international and commercial character of the undertaking, they would suggest that Russia should be admitted to participation and that the percentage allotted to each country should be 20 per cent. Assuming that this distribution is adopted, His Majesty’s Government consider that a Convention should be concluded by the Powers concerned providing for the exclusion of differential rates on any railways in Asiatic Turkey, and for equality of treatment in regard to transport facilities and cognate matters; for the alignment of the railway south of Bagdad and the conditions under which it is to be constructed; for the introduction of approved financial arrangements tending to foster the develop ment of traffic ; and for guaranteeing that the interest in the enterprise of the several parties concerned shall be of lasting duration and not subject to termination on the expiry of the Bagdad Railway concession. [2123 f-1]2 It would furthermore be necessary for the Ottoman Government to undertake formally not to impose river dues on British shipping or cargoes without the assent of His Majesty’s Government. There remains the question of the terminal port: having regard to the fact that important commercial interests are already established at Bussorah, His Majesty’s Government cannot but feel that substantial advantages would accrue from the establishment of the terminus at that point; and they consider that the port should be constructed and controlled by the proposed new company in the interests of the unrestricted commerce of all nations. But if such an arrangement is adopted, they must stipulate that, in the event of the railway ever being prolonged to the Persian Gulf, it must be brought to Koweit under conditions to be settled by agreement between Great Britain and Turkey alone, and a clause to this effect must be embodied in a convention dealing with these matters. (ii.) The respective Interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the Beg ion of the Persian Gulf. His Majesty’s Government are willing to meet the wish expressed in the concluding paragraphs of the Turkish memorandum that a precise definition may be reached as to the respective position of the two countries, commercially and politically, in the Persian Gulf; and they see no reason why a lasting settlement of the questions involved should not be reached. His Majesty’s Government are in no sense opposed to the legitimate claims of the Turkish Government. The most southerly point to which they have ever recognised such claims on the littoral of the Persian Gulf is Ojeir, in 'the district of El Katif. South of this point there is no trace of Turkish power ever having been paramount; in 1870 the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs conveyed to Her Majesty’s Ambassador formal assurances that the Sublime Porte did not entertain any intention of obtaining supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf ; and it is only since that date that certain attempts have been made by the Ottoman Government to establish mudirates and other emblems of Turkish authority at points to the south of Ojeir. The position of His Majesty’s Government in regard to these tribes has been entirely different. With Bahrein they have had direct relations since 1805 ; these relations have found concrete expression in a series of treaties dating from 1820, and having as their objects the suppression of piracy and the slave trade ; the regularity of the succession to the throne ; the protection of the island against foreign aggression ; and the safety of the pearl industry, of which Bahrein is the centre. In Muscat and the territories of the Trucial Chiefs His Majesty’s Government have, in virtue of various treaties and agreements, conferred similar benefits for many years ; and their policy in each case has been inspired by the importance of upholding the maritime peace, of securing open markets to the commerce of all countries, and of protecting the long-established interests of British-Indian subjects. His Majesty’s Government cannot acquiesce in any arrangement which might restrict or undermine the authority which they have exercised uninterruptedly with such beneficent results; they conceive that any extension of Turkish jurisdiction along the littoral of the Persian Gulf to the south of Ojeir would be prejudicial to those results and unsupported by any legitimate claims of Turkish sovereignty ; and they have accordingly resisted any attempts which have been made to encroach upon these regions. They are therefore of opinion that any lasting settlement between the two Powers must provide for the definite renunciation by the Ottoman Govern ment of Bahrein and adjacent islands and of the whole of the Peninsula of El Katr (including El Bidaa), where the Sheikh of Bahrein has important rights; and they consider that such a settlement would finally remove a perennial source of local friction. The Ottoman Government express a wish to regularise the relations of Koweit towards the Ottoman Empire, ancl His Majesty’s Government will gladly contribute to such a solution, on the understanding that their rights and claims are not to be regarded as prejudiced by any proposals which may now be put forward, should such proposals prove abortive. As the Ottoman Government are aware, His Majesty’s Government have never admitted that Koweit is under Turkish protection, and, inasmuch as some divergence of opinion was manifested between the two Governments as to the position there, a modus vivendi was reached in September 1901 by His Majesty’s Government consent ing to give an assurance that, provided the Turkish Government abstained fromsending troops to Koweit and respected the status quo there, they would not occupy that place or establish a British protectorate over it. British trade relations with the Sheikhs of .Koweit have existed for upwards of two centuries and, inasmuch as the place has attracted merchants from all quarters by the equity of its rule and the freedom of its trade, His Majesty’s Government could not consent to any interference with the succession or with the internal administration, or any infringement of the complete autonomy of the Sheikh. On the other hand, they are prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Ivoweit, and to recognise the Sheikh as a Turkish Kaimakam, provided in other respects the status quo is guaranteed, and the validity of certain agreements which the Sheikh has concluded with the British Government is recognised ; provided the islands of Warba and Bubian are admitted by Turkey to be within the confines of Koweit, and Turkish military posts are withdrawn ; and provided finally the Sheikh is admitted to the full and undisturbed enjoyment of any properties he may own or hereafter purchase on Turkish territory. Koweit would thus form a sort of enclave within, and forming part of, the Ottoman Empire, but enjoying complete self-government under Turkish suzerainty. Certain difficulties have recently arisen in regard to the buoyage of the Shat-el- Arab. For a great number of years British shipping has,, owing to. its volume, been predominantly, and until recently almost exclusively, interested in these aids to navigation. For over fifty years the work of surveying, buoying, and lighting the river has been carried out by British agency to the general satisfaction of all concerned. . . . In these circumstances, His Majesty’s Government have some difficulty m appreciating why the Ottoman Government have taken exception to existing and long-standing arrangements ; but, being desirous of dealing with the difficulty in a spirit of conciliation, they would propose to the Ottoman Government the appointment of a small riverain commission, composed of a British and a Turkish representative, with an engineer to be mutually agreed upon. This commission would superintend all matters pertaining to improvement of navigation, and it would likewise superintend the requisite periodical surveys. As regards the rest of the Persian Gulf, on the other hand., the Turkish Govern ment, so far as they are concerned, would recognise the right of Great Britain (a) to control surveying, lighting, buoying, and pilotage; (b) to police its waters; and (c) to conduct all quarantine arrangements. (iii.) The Increase from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem in the Turkish Customs Duties. His Majesty’s Government have consistently maintained that they could in no circumstances assent to the increase in the Turkish customs duties unless a previous and satisfactory settlement had been reached in regard to the Bagdad Railway ^ To this attitude they adhere ; and while they consider that such a settlement might be promoted on the lines of an agreement such as has already been indicated, they could not regard a settlement confined to the railway as either satisfactory or complete, since it would leave in a state of uncertainty a number of questions closely affecting British interests in the regions of Mesopotamia and the Peisian.

His Majesty’s Government are in principle favourable to railway construction m Turkey; but they cannot directly contribute to the completion of the Bagdad Railway if it is* to introduce a further element of possible disturbance into an area where British rights and interests have, especially of late, been wantonly assailed; nor do they feel that they could justify to British public opinion the imposition of a tax which will affect British trade,—amounting in Mesopotamia to some 60 pei cent, ox tie whole,—unless the}^ have provided for a general settlement of political issues m t re Persian Gulf, such as the Ottoman Government themselves desire to bring about, and unless they have obtained some compensation lor and a guarantee against the con tinuance of arbitrary acts such as the demolition, on no adequate pretext, of utis i property in Bagdad. If the Ottoman Government are prepared to enter upon a negotiation on these lines, and to concur, as already stipulated, in a removal of the existing veto on the borrowing powers of Egypta measure which is called for m the interests of financial reform in Egypt,—His Majesty’s Government will make it their first aim to con tribute to an agreement likely to remove all causes of friction between the twoPowers ; and they will not only consent, subject to the concurrence of other Powers and to the due observance of such agreement, to the further increase of the Turkish customs for a lixed period, but they will likewise agree to the continued levy of the 3 per cent, customs increase, which had only been sanctioned provisionallv till the year 1914. ' ' f Foreign Office, July 29, 1911.The Under - Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the Under-Secretary of State for India, and is directed by the Secretary of State to transmit the accompanying correspondence respecting the Bagdad Railway. Foreign Office, &gt; 1912 .Dear Lr. Lax^'ell: - 33, PONT STREET, S.Vi. 21st June, 1912. Pieverting to our conversation of yesterday, 1 enclose a paper which I read last year before the Central Asian Society and would beg to refer you to pages 9 and 10, which have reference to the branch line between Baghdad (Sadijeh) and Khanakin. The Baghdad-Khanakin trade route into Persia has been developed exclusively by Englishmen, practically by members of my own family, and the value of British goods conveyed by this route amounts to over one million sterling a year - a figure which compares with under £100,000 for the trade of all other European countries, including Germany. I think you will admit that 1 have a hereditary claim to put in a word for trie future of this British trade. 1 do hone that our Government will do their very utmost to safeguard this trade and also the trade between Trebizond and Tabriz. It is true that the Baghdad Railway Company, having securedsecured the surplus of the Ottoman Public Debt, are pro bably in a position to complete the railway to Baghdad and the Persian frontier. But 1 understand that the greater part of the railway bonds are still in the safes of the Deutsche Bank and, naturally, the Lerman pro rioters are most anxious to get these bonds taken up in France and England. I am certain, therefore, that they would stretch | W a good Many points in order to secure the goodwill of jl England and Prance. ; j| liow, for us it is vital to obtain an exiective voice in the management of the line botwaen bagndac ana the Persian frontier. .Baghdad is already tne terminus of our river-borne trade; it will soon be connected with I the Mediterranean by the Baghdad-hosul line and later, probably, by a line along the Euphrates. Baghdad is, ,1 therefore, destined to he the reservoir into which several , ! main streams of commerce will pour. The buis oi the goods will be goods in transit for Persia and it is of ti: utmost importance that perfectly equal treatment should be secured for British giods as compared with goods from Germany or other countries. This can only be secured byby 1 inaneial participation in the branch from Baghdad to the Persian frontier. bor can 1 see why the Germans should refuse such participation. It would greatly help them to have Great Britain on their side in the efforts which they will have to make sooner or later to keep the door open in Persia by this route. 1 do, therefore, trust that this proposal may be pressed in any negotiations with Germany over the Baghdad Railway question. As regards the proposed railway from Baghdad down the Tigris, 1 am still at a loss to discover what objects this railway is to serve, unless it be purely strategical objects in relation to the British position on the Persian Gulf. It is surely obvious that all the military requirements of Turkey in policing the Arab tribes between Baghdad and Busreh and in those regions would be met by steamer transport. The fact that I am engaged in promoting a railway up the Valley of the Karun goes to snow, I nope, that the opinion I have formed of a railway between Busreh and Baghdad is not influenced by private consioeratione. River transport can look after itself alongside of a railway. But if our GovernmentGovernment is to be asked to support a railway it ought surely to be made clear that there will be some commercial gain. If the railway is to be built as the result of a further 5% increase of the Customs Duties, the result, so far as Manchester goods are concerned, will be that they will have to submit to an additional tax of 60/- a ton in order to have the luxury of an alternative route up to Baghdad. Under these circumstances, it would surely be better to go slow as regards this railway and to await the developments of irrigation. Any other course would result in the squandering of vast sums of money raised at the expense of the Turkish tax payer, without conferring any benefits upon British trade, rather the contrary. fours sincerely, (Signed) h.

G-rey, and it was intimated at the same time that the India Office would furnish an expression of opinion; a letter, dated July 18th, 1911, was hereupon written by Sir A. Hirtze1, in which he st ated:- 'I understand that Lord Crewe has spoken to Sir E .Grey about this, and my instructions are to send you the enclosed copy of the Foreign Office memorandum with His Lordship’s suggested alterations shown in manuscript, all the suggested alterations were incorporated in this document, which was the draft of the proposed reply to the Turkish Ambassador, in so far as it related to the Bagdad Railway, and it was not until that reply had been submitted to Lord Crewe and initialled by His Lordship that it was despatched. Such bein t the sequence of events, Sir E. Grey learns v itn regret, nine months after the reply has been despatched and its substance communicated to the French, Russian, and German Governments - an interval during which no int imation(21766/12) intimation of His Lordship's change of attitude has reached Sir E. Grey - that Lord Crewe has so far modified his attitude as to regard the distribution of capital, proposed as 'wholly unacceptable and even dangerous'. Sir E. Grey is unaware of the reasons wnicn have led Lord Crev.e to modify his views to so serious an extent as is implied by his letter under reply; but he must point out the very grave objections which exist to withdrawing the offer formally made to the Ottoman Government, after such long and serious consideration, after the lapse of so many months, and at a moment when the Turkish Ambassador has been instructed to discuss the proposals in the most friendly and accommodating spirit. His Majesty's Government are, in Sir E. Grey’s opinion, in honour coiiimitteo. uo those proposals, and they must at any rate await tneir definite rejection before recommencing negotiations on a totally different basis,- negotiations which, it must be remembered, failed on a previous occasion. The reply 01 the Turkish Ambassador is by no means of a character to warrant so subversive a departure from the rules of diplomatic procedure(21766/12) ? * procedure as a refusal to continue the negotiations vould i.or uo demand a participation of fifty per cent or sixty per cent at this late stage of the proceedings would be tantamount to open rupture, and vould cause great disappointment and apprehension at Constantinople. Moreover, preliminary negotiations with France, Russia and Germany would he necessary, unless indeed Germany consented at once to forego any share at all in the Bagdad Bussorah sections, which, in Sir E. Grey’s opinion, it would be as unreasonable to ask as it would be difficult to obtain. Assuming that France and Russia were asked to renounce their shares and were excluded, a., long and difficult negotiation i ith Germany would ensue, and a heavy price would have to be paid for her renunciation of a share equal to that of any other foreign Power; and assuming further that a successful issue were reached, Sir E. Grey apprehends that it is not probo-ble that tne resumption of negotiations with tne Ottoman Government would oe lacilitat ed, as they would deeply resent the discontinuance of the present discussion, and the initiation of negotiations between(21766/12) between tv:o Powers, Eneland and Gen niany, one of v.iiom has largely renounced her claims i m return for a substantial other of v.'hom does not claim at all in those regions. possess any legal The Ottoman Government that no negotiations or discussion in connexion with the Bagdad Railway should be conducted with the German Govern ment , and Bis Highness was assured that no such procedure v as contemplat ed. It was in consequence of the inability of Bis Majesty’s Government to obtain a fifty per cent participation for British interests that the proposals now before the Ottoman Government ? ere made; and Sir E. Grey thinks that one of the reasons then advanced for being satisfied with a smaller participation lias been overlooked in your letter under reply. If it be granted that His Majesty’s Government can only protect British and Indian trade against adverse treatment by securing a participation of fifty per cent, how are they then to avoid such adverse treatment on other parts of the(21766/12) railway, e.g. on the branch to lOianikin, and if adverse treatment exists on that and other portions of the railway, tue utility ox securing equality of treatment on the Bagdad- Bussorah sections is not so apparent? In Sir E. Grey's view, which, until the receipt of your letter under reply, he oeiieved to be shared bv your Department, the most efficacious means of excluding differ ential treatment (not only on tlxe Bagdad-Bus so rah sections but on all railways in Asiatic Turkey) is by a binding international agreement on the subject, and by making the continued levy of the increased customs duty dependent on the precise observance of tnat instrument. For these reasons Sir E. Grey hopes that the barquess of Crewe will reconsider his views and allow the negotia tions with the Turkish Ambassador to proceed on the basis of the proposals formally made to the Ottoman Government in July, Y&amp;Uftf. Sir E. Grey would remind Lord Crewe that His Excellency is anxious to discuss those proposals at an early date, and he thinks that a preliminary discussion oetween tue Departments(21766/12) Departments concerned should take place possible. As regards the Peninsula of El Katr, Sir E. Grey iio.t uu. a.ll^y at uacnes the greatest weight to the views of the Marquess of Crewe, and although he is disposed tc think that His Lordship’s conclusions as to the result of conceding something to Turkey in this region are exaggerated, he does not think it necessary to continue at this stage the discussion on this point, as he would be averse from abating any of the demands advanced in the memorandum of July 29th, 1911, for the present: he would, however, be glad if Lord Crewe would consider at his leisure in what direction it might be possible to make a concession to the Ottoman Government supposing a successful issue of the negotiations depended upon some modification of our extreme demands. If it were worth while to initiate these negotiations, it is worth while to continue them in a reasonable spirit. As to Mohammerah, Sir E. Grey does not consider it practicable to propose to the Persian Government that they should(21766/12) should make a communication as proposed to the Turkish Government, or that His Majesty’s Government should surroort Persia against Turkey in the manner suggested: Sir E. Grey does not consider that it would be possible to reserve this question from the Hague Tribunal if the Turkish Government persisted in such a reference; but, if it is possible to prevent it, Sir E. Grey has no intention of allowing, it, and nronoses to treat a settlement of this frontier as part of the present negotiations and as a necessary condition of their conclusion. A separate letter will be addressed to you shortly respecting the course which it is proposed to pursue in regard to the Mohammerah frontier negotiations.

I am addressing Foreign Office officially, strongly supporting your views. P&gt;ut terms are pretty stiff and contingency must be faced that rather than accept them r I urks will choose Basrah as terminus. Would you abate any of your conditions, if necessary, to avoid this, and, if so, which ? Foreign Office express opinion that it is highly improbable that we shall in any case secure control of Gulf section, but that it may nevertheless be worth while to participate. From Viceroy, 7th March 1911. Private. Koweit. Your telegram of 2nd instant. It would be far better in my opinion that terminus of railway should be at Basrah than that we should accept anything that might weaken our position and that of the Sheikh at Koweit. To do so would have far reaching consequences in the Gulf, where it is absolutely necessary that our predominance should be assured. The only abatement of our conditions that 1 can suggest is a 40 per cent, instead of a 60 per cent, participation in the Gulf section. Although this presents some danger if the Turks have a nominal 40 per cent, and the German 20 per cent, interest in the line. From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 31st March 1911. Private.

Terminus and port to be at Koweit on our land which we will sublet to Company on conditions that would secure our strategic interests, and one of which would be that we alone should police port.

Board of Trade consider 50 per cent, share sufficient protection against differential rates on Gulf Section, while as regards main line, sanction of increased Customs duties for fixed period would be conditional on satisfactoi^ assuiances in this respect, and we should try to get one or two directors on Bagdad Railway.

This proposal appears at first sight to offer better hope of a satisfactory settlement It is essential howeve? that strength of our position at Koweit and m the Gulf should not be ignored, and that in the adjustment of all furkish eiaims m the ju no opening should be allowed for encroachment on the shore of (!| df l y inV Other Power. The following are the conditions that I consider should he obtained :— „ x- i (1.) Autonomy of the Sheikh to be complete as that of Egypt or former &gt; of Eastern Roumelia. .. oi, -m (2.) Construction of port to be British concession from Sheikh (3 ) Port Customs to be administered by us jointly with Sheikh, subject in case of transit duties to scrutiny by Turkish representative, and (4.)

Policing of the port to be in our hands. ( 6 .) J urisdiction, civil and criminal, of port to rest with us except where Sheikh’s subjects alone concerned. c au -i u (7.) No fortifications to be built or troops other than of Sheikh and ourselves to be located at Koweit without our consent. ( 8 .) Lighting, buoying, and pilotage of the Gulf, including Shat-el-Aiab, to be in our hands. I regard this as important. Sheikh would be so favourably affected by assured autonomy that I consider we could easily arrive at a satisfactory agreement with him regarding conditions (2), (3), (5), and ( 6 ) above. From Viceroy, 29th April 1911. Private. Hirtzel’s private letter to Eoreign Secretary of 7th April. If it should be possible to secure an arrangement with Turkey on terms contained in memorandum enclosed in Eoreign Office letter of 3rd April, the result will be eminently satisfactory. There are, however, a few amendments that I would like to suggest. Paragraphs .(1) and (n) : it might be laid down that we and the Sheikh are to jointly administer the Customs and transit duties. It would have to be so, and it is as well to state the fact clearly. Paragraph (o): we should add “ except when subjects of the Sheikh are alone concerned, civil and criminal jurisdiction of port should rest with British officials.” Paragraph (x) : The drafting is not clear. Should it not be “there shall be no interference with existing British buoys or with, &amp;c., &amp;c., by British agency r It seems also important to add after the words “ coasts of the Gulf,” the following sentence : “or the approaches of the Shat-el-Arab.” Paragraph (y) should read “ the Persian Gulf and Shat-el-Arab shall be open to the navigation of all countries.” This is a counsel of perfection, but it would, I think, be wise to obtain these points, if possible. From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 1st Jane 1911. Private. Your official telegram of 16th May. Bagdad Railway terminus. As Turkey has not yet been approached on lines dealt with in private telegrams ending with yours of 29th April, please let me have by telegraph as soon as possible your observations on situation created by Admiral’s view that Basrah is a more suitable terminus than Koweit.From Viceroy, 8th June 1911. Private. ^ Your private telegram of 1st instant. Baghdad Railway terminus. The Admiral s view ol the value of Basrah as a port, and the fact that W illcocks has made a statement to the Turkish Government in the same sense, have ieduced likelihood that Koweit will eventually become terminus of the railway. Consequently the value of our position at Koweit as a bargaining factor for participation and control of the Gulf section has fallen, and we must rely almost exclusively on our consent to the additional 4 per cent. Customs duty as a lever to obtain the terms we desire. The force of this condition should not be underrated, since upon our consent is dependent that of all the other powers, while our long-established position and trade in Mesopotamia demand recognition by Turkey. To press for Koweit as the terminus would be a mistake, since if the port of Basrah were developed and the Shat-el-Arab dredged, Basrah would probably become the port in use, and a line from Basrah to Koweit would fall into disuse and never pay its way. Our policy in the event of Basrah becoming the terminus should be to endeavour to obtain as large a participation as possible in the building and control of the Baghdad-Basrah section and the construction of the port at Basrah ; as large a share as possible in the control of the conservancy of the Shat-el-Arab as representing the riparian interests of Persia and the pre dominant and independent position to which our prevailing share of the tonnage and trade and our long-established position on the river give us a claim; the maintenance at all costs of the status quo at Koweit any in the Persian Gulf; and the construction as rapidly as possible of a railwad from Mohammerah or Ahwaz to Kiioremabad and the North of Persia. If the project of the Trans-Persian railway were likely to be realised in the near future, the Mohammerah-Khoremabad line would lose much of its importance as a counterpoise, but the necessity for the Mohammerah-Khor Musa-Shiraz line would proportionately increase. It is, therefore, important to secure the option we have asked for, the Khoremabad line with port at Khor Musa and branch line to Mohammerah, as soon as possible. The possession of a port at Khor Musa under our control may hereafter, by strengthening our position in the Gulf, compensate us for what we may now lose by new situation in regard to Basrah and Shat-el-Arab. From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 18th July 1911. Private. Your private telegram of 29th April. Bagdad Railway. Pro posals have now been entirely recast. Most important are as follows (1.) International company to be formed of Turkey, Germany, France, Russia, and Fngland, with 20 per cent. each. (2.) Basrah to be terminus, but if railway ever extended, it must be brought to Koweit under conditions to be settled between Turkey and us. (3.)

The following are our views : Proposal No. 1 may be accepted on the understanding that proposals Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5, are granted in full. It would then be desirable to arrive at an agreement with 1 ranee and Russia to support British interests in the Gulf section in return for our support in any other section in which they may respectively be interested. In this way the control that we desire might be obtained. Proposal No. 2. The condition proposed is a valuable one and should be obtained. n . ... T ? Proposal No. 3 seems quite satisfactary, and should be the means ot excluding any other power. . , „ T r • • t Proposal No. 4. The situation (? to be) desired for Koweit is one ot (? complete) autonomy under the suzerainty of Sultan, and great care should be taken to avoid any ambiguity in the formula adopted which might present an opening for future Turkish interference or aggression. Proposal No. 5 is quite satisfactory. If m return for these conditions we are to agree to the additional 4 pei cent. Customs duties, I would recommend that we should avail ourselves of this opportunity to obtain at the same time from the Turkish Government their recognition of our right (1) to police the waters of the Gulf ; (2) to conduct all quarantine arrangements in the Gulf; (3) to control the lighting, buoying, and pilotage of Gulf (outside the waters controlled by Turco-British Riverain Commission). From Viceroy, 21st July 1911. Private. My private telegram of 16th July. Baghdad Railway. I venture to attach some importance to the recognition by Turkey of the three points contained in the last paragraph of my telegram, since it would form a useful precedent to obtain similar recognition from other Powers. I am not sure that we ought not to insist at the same time on the recognition by Turkey of the administrative frontier of Persia west of Mohammerah which still remains under dispute, but the three additional points mentioned in my telegram are more important. From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 31st July 1911. Private. Your private telegram of 21st July. Baghdad Railway. Three points referred to will be inserted in Foreign Office’s reply to the Porte.

Informal discussion with Turkish delegates has begun. As regards Section 2 of British memorandum of 29th July 1911, they seem to think they can meet us except as to Katr, where withdrawal of military post would be regarded by Turkish Parliament as unjustifiable cession of territory. I hey ask whether consolidation of Turkish authority there cannot be reconciled with our interests, such as suppression of arms tiaffic, protection of pearl fisheries, and Sheikh of Bahrein’s pasturage rights, and combined with exercise ot our maritime supervision where necessary. There seems force in their argument about Parliament, and I should like to know if you think exclusion of 1 urks from Katr is worth sacrifice of any material parts of our other claims. All the ground has not yet been covered, but if agreement can be reached on all other points, would you accept this compromise provided that 1 urks bind themselves either to suppress arms traffic themselves or, failing that, to allow us to do so? And what conditions would you suggest to secure our interests above mentioned ? Please reply as soon as possible. From Viceroy, 20th March 1912. Private. Your private telegram of 20th instant. Any settlement which tends to consolidate position of Turkey in the Gulf will in my opinion leave much to be desired. Our refusal to recognise locus standi of Turkey in Katr has hitherto prevented the exercise of any jurisdiction and the small military post at El Bidaa have been practically prisoners. Our specific recognition of their suzerainty in Katr will enable Turks to consolidate their position both on the coast and in the hinterland from the limits of Koweit down to Odeid. It will give them for the first time foothold in Gulf with many potential possibilities and will open up question of joint intervention with us in Gulf affairs. I do not see how this can be reconciled with our interests, whether it be in suppression of arms traffic, protection of pearl fisheries, or the combined exercise of maritime supervision. Nothing but serious prejudice to our interests in the Gulf seems likely to result from such a development. The memorandum of 29th July represents irreducible minimum to our pledge (?), and I can find nothing which we can surrender with safety. If it is merely a dislike to the withdrawal of the garrison of El Bidaa which forms present obstacle in discussion, it might perhaps be possible to safeguard Turkish amour propre by allowing present nominal garrison to stay there on condition that no Turkish jurisdiction is exercised in Katr outside El Bidaa, and that we are allowed to suppress arms traffic there. From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 25th May 1912. Private. My foreign secret telegram of 14th instant and your private telegrams -of 29th April 1911 and 16th July 1911. Bagdad Railway. I am strongly inclined to think that Turkish counter-proposal should be used as opportunity for getting rid of French and Russian participation and returning to our original idea of 50 per cent, for ourselves and the remaindei divided between Turkey and Germany. 1 have never believed that 60 per cent, divided between France, Russia, and ourselves, even if backed by an international convention, is equivalent, for purpose of defence against differential rates, to 50 per cent, for ourselves alone, and there would surely be great loss of prestige if we were reduced to so small a share. More over our dependence on the two other Powers here might eventually be a source of weakness elsewhere. I should be glad to have your definite opinion as to relative advantages of the two proposals as soon as possible.From Viceroy, 29t/i May 1912. Private Your private telegram dated 25th instant Bagdad Railway. From an Indian point of view ihere can be no possible doubt whatever as to Sadv a e advantage of the two proposals. We '5^1^ fnrn 50 percent participation tor ourselves m the Unit section leaving me rlainde^for dLp'osal L Turkey may wish. We have always lei a 20 or 95 ner cent participation must necessarily involve a loss ot piestige regions adjoining Persian Gulf (see secret telegram of 23rd March 1911), and that it might possibly become necessary some day to give compensation to France'aiS Russia eLwhere for their continued support of o-mtere^ts in Mesopotamia. With a 50 per cent, share we can make practicaUy s e uo-uinst differentiation in rates. In considering all questions attectm B Mesopotamia, it is advisable to bear in mind that the situation is a fluid one, and it is difficult to foresee what the position there may be in 20 years time. CWul as we should therefore be to do all in our power to conso .date our own position and to establish a lien for the future, we feel strongly that no concess on in Mesopotamia or elsewhere should be permitted to weaken our position of predominance in the Gulf where we are able and should continue to be able to assert ourselves in maintaining it against ail comeis.[ 16000 ] No. 1. Memorandum communicated to Teiofik Pasha. HIS Majesty’s Government are giving their careful attention to the important proposals contained in the memorandum communicated by his Highness the Turkish Ambassador on the 15th April, and they trust to be in a position to continue the negotiations with the Turkish Government when detailed investigations have been completed by the departments concerned. In the meantime, however, they are somewhat doubtful, from the terms of the Turkish memorandum, whether, leaving on one side for the moment the territorial questions involved, the Turkish Government are prepared to accept the basis of settlement proposed by His Majesty’s Government in the following paragraph :—• “ British trade relations with the sheikhs of Koweit have existed for upwards of two centuries and, inasmuch as the place has attracted merchants from all quarters by the equity of its rule and the freedom of its trade, (1) His Majesty’s Government could not consent to any interference with the succession or with the internal administration, or any infringement of the complete autonomy of the sheikh ; (2) on the other hand, they are prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Koweit, and to recognise the sheikh as a Turkish kaimakam ; (3) provided in other respects the status quo is guaranteed; (4) and the validity of certain agreements which the sheikh has concluded with the British Government is recognised; ... (5) and provided finally the sheikh is admitted to the full and undisturbed enjoyment of any properties he may own or hereafter purchase on Turkish territory ; (6) Koweit would thus form a sort of enclave within, and forming part of, the Ottoman Empire, but enjoying complete self-government under Turkish suzerainty.” His Majesty’s Government would be glad to have an explicit reply with regard to each of the propositions enumerated above. There is another question which has recently caused some concern to His Majesty s Government, viz., that of the frontier between Turkey and Persia in the legion of Mohammerah. When His Majesty’s Government addressed their memorandum of last July to the Turkish Government that question had been dormant for sixty years and His Majesty’s Government had no desire to raise it. But from the attitude of the Turkish frontier commissioners at Constantinople they are led to apprehend that the Turkish Government may contemplate advancing claims which woiild inevitably re-act unfavourably upon the adjustment of the respective interests of peat n am and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf, in view of the close relations existing between His Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Foreign Office, May 10 , 1012 . [2485 k~l][This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.! [A] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [ 16000 ] No. I. Joint Minute by Sir A. Eirtzel and Mr. Parker on the Turkish Government’s Memorandum communicated on April 15, 1912. 1. Bagdad Bailway. (a.) Division of Share-capital in the Bagdad Bussorah Section. HFS Majesty’s Government originally proposed, in July 1910, that British interests should be represented by 55 per cent, of the total share-capital. Turkey replied that she would prefer a distribution of 40 per cent, for herself, of 20 per cent, to Germany, 20 per cent, to France, and 20 per cent, to England. To this, in July 1911, His Majesty’s Government made a counter-proposal that the distribution should be 20 per cent, each to Turkey, France, Germany, England, and Russia; the idea being to secure 60 per cent., or a majority, to the 3 Entente Powers : England, France, and Russia. Turkey now professes to fall in with the British view, by distributing the capital equally between herself, France, Germany, and England, in the proportion of 25 per cent, each, the Chairmanship and casting vote being reserved to Turkey! No mention is made of Russia ; but, in our informal discussions, the Turks intimated that they would not willingly admit Russia, and that, if His Majesty’s Government persisted, they would have to introduce another country, say Switzerland, to counterbalance her. The effect of giving 25 per cent, to each of four Powers, and allotting to Turkey a casting vote, would be to place control in the hands of the Turco-German group, in so far as control does actually depend on the percentage of capital held. Control probably does depend upon the voting rights of the various sections of shareholders in so far as the appointment of a manager'^ and other high officials and similar matters are concerned. But though the control to be exercised by the Board of Directors will not be absolute (since it is proposed to fix by Convention the maximum and minimum scales of tariff rates and many details regarding transport facilities), and it is therefore possible to attach too great importance to the distribution of the share-capital as a means of control, we cannot recommend acceptance of the Turkish proposal, which we believe would be generally regarded as politically a defeat of His Majesty s Government, while financially the small amount of British capital that would find employment would cause great disappointment. Sir H. Babington-Smith has expressed his belief that Turkey, on the analogy of her holding in the Bagdad Railway, which is only 10 per cent., would be satisfied with a share of 10 per cent, or 15 per cent, in the Bagdad—Bussorah section, and he appears to have discussed the subject with the Turkish Ambassador in London. But ve are led to think that his impression is erroneous ; since the Turkish delegates repiesented to us that Turkev, as the territorial Power, was already making a great concession in limiting her share to the same amount as that of the other ^Powers participating and * We might stipulate that the Manager should be British, [2435 aa —1]would be in a position nominally superior to the foreign countries^ and this would make the agreement more acceptable to the Ottoman Parliament But we anticipate great reluctance on the part of Turkey to any arrangement admitting Russian P We have already expressed the view that the control to be exercised by the Board will be unusually circumscribed; but, such as it is, it wilt in so far as it is to serve British interests, be dependent upon the continued solidarity of the Entente Powers. The proposal made by His Majesty’s Government last July is based upon the assumption that, during the whole period of the concession—that is, for 99 years at least—the general policy of His Majesty’s Government and the Governments of France and Russia will be such as to insure concerted action on the railway Board, and it presupposes that the Governments concerned will be able to control the policy of their financiers, which in the case of France at least is more than doubtful We venture to suggest that it may in future prove inconvenient that our interests should depend upon the co-operation of France and Russia on the Board, since the necessity of insuring concerted action by the three Powers in Mesopotamia may handicap British policy in other quarters. # . . , Moreover, it must be remembered that Russian commercial interests are here contrary to our own, since the value of this section to us—at all events for many years to come—lies in the fact that it will enable us more easily to pour our goods into Western and Northern Persia where at present Prussia is our only rival. We are accordingly far from being persuaded that it is in the interests of this country to insist upon Russian participation in the Bagdad-Bussorah section ; and we venture to think that it would be better to provide for the Russian Government by participation in the Khanikin branch, to which, on terms, the German Government might assent, though the last-mentioned consideration applies to this couise also. It must not be overlooked that Turkey is not altogether a free agent in legard to the distribution of capital, since the Bagdad Railway Company has reserved the right to a share equal to that obtained by any foreign country in the Bagdad- Bussorah sections. (b.) Proposed international convention providing for the exclusion of differential rates on any railways in Asiatic Turkey; for the alignment of the railway south of Bagdad, and the conditions under which it is to he constructed; and for guaranteeing that the interest in the enterprise of the several parties concerned shall he of lasting duration and not subject to termination on the expiry of the Bagdad Railway Company’s concession. No specific mention is made in the Turkish reply of the “ international convention which His Majesty’s Government desire, but we understood from the Turkish delegates that no objection would he raised to it. With regard to the exclusion of differential treatment, the Turkish Government declare themselves ready to assure to British commerce all facilities compatible with the agreements already concluded by Turkey with the Bagdad Railway Company. This limitation no doubt principally refers to the “ Cahier des Charges or specification attached to the Bagdad Railway Convention of 1903, and there is some force in the contention of the Turkish Government that their hands are tied so far as concerns rates on the Bagdad Railway. The specification is composed of technical details, and it would be well to ask the Board of Trade and Government of India to cause an expert examination of the schedule of rates to be made, so as to ascertain whether they are of a nature to serve or to militate against British-Indian trade. At first sight the Turkish reply on this point, the exclusion of differential rates, seems satisfactory. Sir H. Babington-Smith has suggested that it is of great importance to provide that the facilities and rates on the Khanikin branch shall be the same for goods arriving from the Gulf as for those arriving from the Mediterranean. In this view we entirely agree. The Turkish Government are ready to meet His Majesty’s Government in regard to the alignment and the financial arrangements, subject to the arrangement of details. On the other hand, they say that they are not prepared to agree to the arrangement to be arrived at for the Bagdad-Bussorah sections being of lasting duration, instead of subject to termination on the expiry of the Bagdad Railway concession. This is a point of some importance ; and we do not think His Majesty’sGovernment would be well advised to modify the attitude they have taken up on k adm’itted° n th ^ CaS f lf t l le P rl . u f P le L of re-purchase by the Turkish Government is admitted, the exercise of such a right should be made subject to an undertaking 'Vot bd preSe ' t ?g ree ™ ent ln re g ard t0 the exclusion of differential treatment should (c.) Pecuniary indemnity to he -paid to the Bagdad Railway Company in respect of its renunciation of the right to construct the section of the railway between Bagdad and the rersian Gulf. The Turkish Government say that this charge must be borne by the proposed new company for the railway south of Bagdad. It was always supposed that this i.u ^ 11 ° ; and W n “ WeU 0 b j ect Indeed ’ Sir H ' Babington-Smith has pointed out that this is really lurkeys affair: Germany claims 2 , 0001 . for each kilometre abandoned by her; and Sir H. Babmgton-Smith has suggested that Turkey would do well to offer bonds of the face value of 2 , 0001 . in place of cash, especially since the value oi these bonds has fallen about 10 per cent, during the present war. (d.) Fiver Dues. It seems equitable that Turkey should impose such dues for services rendered in dredging and such like operations in the Shatt-el-Arab; but we propose to discuss this point further in relation to the proposed riverain commission. (e.) Prolongation of the Failway from Bussorah to the Persian Gulf. His Majesty’s Government proposed, and Turkey agrees, that the best terminus for the moment would be Bussorah. But His Majesty’s Government further proposed that, in the event of the railway ever being prolonged to the Persian Gulf, it must be brought to Koweit under conditions to be settled by agreement between Great Britain and Turkey alone, and that a clause to this effect must be inserted now in a convention dealing with these matters. Turkey replies that there is no present cause for contemplating a continuation of the railway beyond Bussorah, but that, nevertheless, the Turkish Government are prepared to give to His Majesty’s Government all assurances necessary to disperse any anxieties which may be felt concerning the continuation in question. His Majesty’s Government have every reason to insist upon a settlement of this question now, when they are negotiating for a general settlement, and possess the powerful lever of the customs increase. The Turkish delegates have represented that Turkey could not agree to the terminus of this Turkish line being under the control of either an Arab Sheikh or a foreign Power. The Turkish point of view is intelligible ; and it was partly owing to the difficulty of finding a satisfactory solution otherwise that His Majesty’s Government suggested that the railway should stop at Bussorah. We think therefore that His Majesty’s Government should maintain the view, in which the Turkish Government acquiesce, that the principal terminus should be at Bussorah, and that the prolongation to the Gulf should merely be regarded as a branch. But there is some danger that the Turkish Government might, if they could not secure arrangements satisfactory to them at Koweit, bring the Gulf branch to Urn Kasr or elsewhere, and that the Sheikh of Koweit might deplore such a development. The Sheikh seemed gratified in 1907 when His Majesty’s Government concluded the lease of_ the foreshore, as he interpreted the transaction as a clear indication that the terminus of the Bagdad Bail way would be at Koweit, and consequently that the commercial wealth of the port would be increased. But we would not attach too great weight to this consideiation provided that the Sheikh’s position is secured. i 11 i We accordingly think it important that the Turkish Government s 1011 d &gt;e induced to bind themselves to bring the branch from Bussoiah to tie u , i an when constructed, to Koweit under conditions to be settled at the time between Turkey and Great Britain; but that the position of Bussorah, as the real terminus, * I understood them to say that if the Bagdad Railway Concession were extended, the other should be extended also. Could we not compromise on that? A. II. agiee. * . j. .should be emphasised, and that the continuation to Koweit should be characterised as a branch line in the further negotiations with Turkey. (f.) Proposed construction and control of the port at Bussorah by the new railway, company in the interests of the unrestricted commerce of all nations. Turkey ignores, in her reply, the question of the construction and control of the terminal port at Bussorah. The Turkish delegates did, however, intimate to us verbally that Turkey would agree to the construction of the port at Bussorah by the new company. They did not mention control; and probably such measures as police control would have to remain, as at present, in Turkish hands. But it is desirable that control of the port should be entrusted to the proposed riverain commission. 2.—Political and Territorial Questions. (See map annexed.) (a.) El Katr. Here there is complete divergency between the Turkish and the British point of view. The Turkish Government have maintained a post at El Bidaa for 40 years ; and the Turkish Delegates have emphasised the difficulty there would be in reconciling parliamentary opinion to the abandonment of territory which Turkey has never formally renounced; and they represented that such a surrender would be particularly difficult to justify at a time when public opinion is smarting under the loss of Tripoli. They there fore urged that British interests might be reconciled with a consolidation of Turkish dominion in El Katr; but from this view the British Pesident in the Persian Gulf and the Government of India emphatically dissent. It appears to us that there is nothing in the Turkish agreement that would justify His Majesty’s Government in abandoning one iota of the claims advanced in the memo randum of July 1911, seeing that an important object, in embarking on a settlement of Gulf questions was to eliminate the Turks from the peninsula. Wb consider that His Majesty’s Government should protest energetically against the Turkish attempt to whittle away the assurances (see Annexe i) given by the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, and repeatedly given, to the effect that Turkey did not entertain any intention of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, and the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf; though Turkey did (in the person of Midhat Pasha) argue that there were no independent tribes in Nedjd. (b.) Bahrein. The Turkish reply on this point is, we think, fairly satisfactory. M^e understood from the Tuikish delegates that Turkey is prepared to agree to Bahreinis having British Consular protection in Turkey, but not rights under the Capitulations, and this appears a reasonable attitude. (c). Zakhnuniyeh Island. . According, to the Turkish delegates this isle is connected at low tide with the mainland. It is however opposite a portion of the mainland which is south of Ojeir the most southerly limit to which His Majesty’s Government have ever recognised Turkish influence, and this attempt to establish themselves on the island seems to date only from 1909. J (d.) Koweit. The luikish leply evades a direct answer to much that was written in the British memorandum of July 1911. 'We consider that no useful purpose would be served by entering into a controversy as to past history, and that it would be expedient to reply to the Turkish Government that,, while His Majesty’s Government cannot accept or admit the justice of the lurkish contentions, they would be glad to learn whether the Turkish Government areprepared to accept the settlement suggested by His Majesty’s Government last July, in the following paragraph :— British trade relations with the Sheikhs of Koweit have existed for upwards of two centuries and, inasmuch as the place has attracted merchants from all quarters by the equity *|of its rule and the freedom of its trade, His Majesty’s Government could not consent to any interference with the succession or with the internal administration, or any infringement of the complete autonomy of the Sheikh. On the other hand, they are prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Koweit, and to recognise the Sheikh as a Turkish Kaimakam, provided in other respects the status quo is guaranteed, and the validity of certain agreements which the Sheikh has concluded with the British Government is recognised; provided the islands of Warba and Bubian are admitted by Turkey to be within the confines of Koweit, and Turkish military posts are withdrawn ; and provided finally the Sheikh is admitted to the full and undisturbed enjoyment of any properties he may own or hereafter purchase on Turkish territory. Koweit would thus form a sort of enclave within, and forming part of, the Ottoman Empire, but enjoying complete self-governmemt under Turkish suzerainty. As^regards the limits of Koweit it may be mentioned that in 1908 and again in 1910 the British agents toured over the whole of the country claimed by His Majesty’s Government without finding traces of any influence there except that of the Sheikh. But for the moment it is perhaps unnecessary to make any further reference to this subject, though unless the limits are eventually defined misunder standing is certain to arise. Meanwhile we consider that the Turkish Government should be informed that His Majesty’s Government could not agree to conclude an arrangement with Turkey if the military post is maintained at Bubiyan Island; and we consider that it would be impracticable to transfer our agreements with the Sheikh in the manner suggested in the Turkish reply. (e.) Riverain Commission for the Shatt-el-Arab. Instead of the joint Commission proposed by His Majesty’s Government, the Turkish Government suggest an Ottoman Commission, with a_ British engineer on it in the service of the Turkish Government, in order to avoid the appearance of internationalisation which it is their interest (and ours) to avoid. We understood from the delegates that the Commission would consist of two members only, and that the British representative would be in every respect equal to his Turkish colleague, and further that he would be free to correspond with the British Government as he pleased. Provided that his rights are secured by the Convention, and that it is also^ arranged that the two Governments shall agree as to the individual to be appointed, w T e think this may be accepted. But His Majesty’s Government’s further proposal that the executive engineer should be British should be insisted on. As soon as this Commission does any real work, the question of dues must pome up, thouo’h so long as the expenditure is small, it may be possible to avoid it. But if the ownership of the Shatt is on other grounds adjudged to Tuikey, the Turkish right to levy dues is undeniable, and if the dues are fixed by a Commission, constituted as proposed, its exercise seems harmless. The Turkish Government would undertake that there shall be no differential treatment of British shipping, and this should be embodied in the Convention. The Board of Trade might be asked to advise as to any other conditions that may be necessary. . ,, The Turkish delegates were anxious that it should be understood that all pilotage in the Shatt-el-Arab would be controlled by the Commission, and this may be agreed to. (f.) Pilotage, &amp;e., in the Gulf. This is not mentioned in the Turkish reply, and His Majesty s_ Government should repeat their claim to control it themselves. At the same time, it seems desirable to define the limits of territorial waters, on the basis of the Government of India’s telegram of the 18th April, and a chart, on which they are clearly shown might form an annex to the Convention. It would be agreed that any of the existing British buoys, &amp;c., or of those about to be laid down by us, which might be found to he in Turkish waters, would pass with the control of the Biveram Commission. (g.) Policing of the Gulf. Turkey desires to carry this out jointly with Great Britain It is evident from this proposal, and from the proposal that they should consolidate themselves on El Katr,as well as from the general attitude of the Turkish delegates, that what the Turks ar&amp; aiming at is, under the proposed settlement, not only to secure what they already possess on sufferance, but also to obtain a footing which they have never had before. Now whatever may be said from the point of view of law, history, or policy, for the former aim, there is clearly no justification for the latter, and His Majesty’s Govern- r ment, whose whole object is to get the Turks, as far as possible, ^ out of the Gulf, can clearly, in no circumstances, acquiesce in it. We submit that this should be made quite plain, and it might be well to remind the Turks of Lord Lansdowne’s statement m the House of Lords on the 5 th May, 1903, that “wm should regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf, by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and w r e should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal.” The next step would seem to act as suggested under (d) on p. 4. A. HIRTZEL. ALWYN PARKER. April 24, 1912.CONFIDENTIAL. ThisDocumentJs the property of the Secretary of State for India in Council. P. 1858. (Immediate.) Sir, India Office, 21st May 1912. . 1 am dire(, ted by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, No. 16,000, of the 16th instant, on the subject of the -Bagdad Railway and connected questions. In reply I am to say that if, after the very full discussions that have already taken place, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs considers that a urther interdepartmental conference is necessary, the Marquess of Crewe wi depute a representative of this Office to attend it. But, personally, he considers it sufficiently established that, regard being had to the magnitude of ntish interests involved, this country cannot with dignity, or indeed with safety, agree to participate on a basis of less than 50 per cent., and he has always regarded the distribution of 60 per cent, between Great Britain, France, and Russia (or between the first two alone) as a wholly unacceptable, and even dangerous, alternative. Further, he holds very strongly the view of his predecessor (see paragraph 9 of Sir R. Ritchie’s letter of the 29th March. 1911) that a friendly agreement with Germany is an essential preliminary to a satisfactory settlement, and I am to suggest that the Bagdad Railway Company and the German Government should at once be approached with a view to such a modification of the declaration of 7 th March 1911 as would enable this country to participate in the Bagdad-Basra branch to an extent more nearly proportionate to our commercial interests in that region. As regards FI Katr I am to say that in Lord Crewe’s opinion an entirely new situation would be created in the Persian Gulf, and one m everv way detrimental to British interests, if the Turks were allowed to consolidate themselves there. Such consolidation is indeed contradictory of the main object of His Majesty’s Government in attempting a settlement of questions in the Gulf, which was to eliminate Turkish influence as far as possible, and in any case to limit it to the head of the Gulf. That influence in El Hasa has existed only since Midhat Pasha’s expedition in 1871, and may be said to exist at present on sufferance, for so long as the quasi-independence of Koweit is maintained, El Hasa must remain more or less isolated. But the construction of the Bagdad Railway to Basra or Koweit will undoubtedly enable the Turkish Government to make their authority much more effective ; and the further result of allowing, under the sanction of a Convention, the consolidation of Turkish power in the peninsula of El Katr will, His Lordship thinks, be not only to enable the Turkish Government to extend and establish it in the interior, but also to give them a secure and recognised point d'appui within the British sphere of interest. The position of Bahrein—-as a kind of British enclave in Turkish territory—will be anomalous and precarious, while the Trucial Coast will become the scene of constant intrigues requiring increased vigilance—and therefore increased expenditure on the part of His Majesty’s Government to check it. Moreover, the Turkish desire to The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.intervene jointly with us in the affairs of the Gulf will be strengthened, and will amount to something like a claim if Turkish authority is once recognised and effective. In Lord Crewe’s opinion no Convention, however strictly drawn, can remove these disadvantages. He apprehends that the Tuiks vill always intrigue ; that when taxed with it they will den\ it 01 produce sufficiently plausible excuses; while His Majesty’s Government, with their many commitments elsewhere, will always have sufficient leason foi not taking at any given moment an extreme step which would not be the less inconvenient or expensive merely because it happened to be justified by the terms of the Convention. The Turkish garrison at El Bidaa—unrecognised for 40 years, but nevertheless in possession—may indeed be regarded as a symbol of British policy in the Persian Gulf. Turning now to Mohammera, Lord Crewe understands that the Turks are advancing extravagant claims, in the hope, by subsequent concessions there, of obtaining corresponding advantages elsewhere ; and in your letter under reply the fear is expressed that if this hope is not realised, and the case goes to the Hague Tribunal, the result might be even to give to Turkey the line claimed by Dervish Pasha in 1850. Lord Crewe, as at present advised, sees no grounds for such an apprehension. That line was not accepted by the Mediating Commissioners, and His Lordship imagines that the evidence upon which they rejected it would weigh equally with the Hague Tribunal. Moreover, it is clear that the Turks do not greatly trust their own evidence, since otherwise they would not contemplate giving the line aw 7 ay in negotia tion. It would seem to His Lordship to be more probable that the Hague Tribunal would fix a line approximating to that of the Mediating Com missioners ; and if the alternatives are to allow the consolidation of Turkish authority in El Katr or to deprive the Sheikh of Mohammera of the district between the Mediating Commissioners’ line and the - frontier as locally observed, he would choose the latter as the lesser evil. In conclusion, I am to enquire whether Sir E. Grey is satisfied that it is impossible to reserve the rights of Mohammera as regards any reference to the Hague Tribunal. It does not appear that there has been any material alteration in the status quo between Howeizah and the Shatt-el-Arab since the Treaty of Erzeroum. In other words, there is no case in that region for arbitration, and the situation therefore differs entirely from that on the northern section, where it is precisely the vital nature of the alterations made in recent years that is the cause of the whole difficulty. This essential difference might perhaps be held to justify Persia in informing the Turkish Government (and His Majesty’s Government in supporting her should necessity anse), that while there would be no objection to minor lectifications b } 7 the Hague Tribunal of the frontier locally recognised, compared with the Mediating Commissioners’ line, no award substantially modifying it will be accepted. Copy of a telegram addressed to the Government of India is enclosed : their reply, with any further observations that may be necessary, will be communicated to you in due course. I have the honour to be, Sir, Tour most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) L. Abrahams. tU'CONFIDENTIAL, P. 1858. (Immediate.) Sir, India Office:, 21st May 1912.

In reply I am to say that if, after the very full discussions that have already taken place, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs considers that a further interdepartmental conference is necessary, the Marquess of Crewe will depute a representative of this Office to attend it. But, personally, he considers it sufficiently established that, regard being had to the magnitude of British interests involved, this country cannot with dignity, of indeed with safety, agree to participate on a basis of less than 50 per cent., and he has always regarded the distribution of 60 per cent, between Great Britain, France, and Russia (or between the first two alone) as a wholly unacceptable, and even dangerous, alternative. Further, he holds very strongly the view r of his predecessor (see paragraph 9 of Sir R. Ritchie’s letter of the 29th March 1911) that a friendly agreement with Germany is an essential preliminary to a satisfactory settlement, and I am to suggest that the Bagdad Railway Company and the German Government should at once be approached with a view to such a modification of the declaration of 7th March 1911 as would enable this country to participate in the Bagdad-Basra branch to an extent more nearly proportionate to our commercial interests in that region. As regards El Katr I am to say that in Lord Crewe’s opinion an entirely new situation w r ould be created in the Persian Gulf, and one in eveiy way detrimental to British interests, if the Turks were allowed to consolidate themselves there. Such consolidation is indeed contradictory of the main object of His Majesty’s Government in attempting a settlement of questions in the Gulf, which was to eliminate Turkish influence as far as possible, and in any case to limit it to the head of the Gulf. That influence in LI Hasa has existed only since Midhat Pasha’s expedition in 1871, and may be said to exist at present on sufferance, for so long as the quasi-independence of Koweit is maintained, El Hasa must remain more or less isolated. But the construction of the Bagdad Railway to Basra or Koweit will undoubtedly enable the Turkish Government to make their authority much more effective ; and the further result of allowing, under the sanction of a Convention the consolidation of Turkish power in the peninsula of El Katr will His Lordship thinks be not only to enable the Turkish Government to extend and establish it in the interior, but also to give them a secure and recognised point dappm within the British sphere of interest. The position of Bahrein-as a kind of British enclave in Turkish territory-will be anomalous and precarious, while the Trucial Coast will become the scene of constant intrigues requiring increased vigilance-and therefore increased e.pendrture-on the^ part His Majesty’s Government to check it. Moreover, e The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.intervene Jointly with us in the affairs of the Gulf will be strengthened, and will amount to something like a claim if Turkish authority is once recognised and effective. In Lord Crewe’s opinion no Convention, however strictly drawn, can remove these disadvantages. He apprehends that the Turks will always intrigue ; that when taxed with it they will deny it or produce sufficiently plausible exouses; while His Majesty’s Government, with their many commitments elsewhere, will always haAO sufficient leason for not taking at any given moment an extreme step which would not be the less inconvenient or expensive merely because it happened to be justified by the terms of the Convention. The Turkish garrison at El Bidaa—unrecognised for 40 years, but nevertheless in possession—may indeed be regarded as a symbol of British policy in the Persian Gulf. Turning now to Mohammera, Lord Crewe understands that the Turks are advancing extravagant claims, in the hope, by subsequent concessions there, of obtaining corresponding advantages elsewhere ; and in your letter under reply the fear is expressed that if this hope is not realised, and the case goes to the Hague Tribunal, the result might be even to give to Turkey the line claimed by Dervish Pasha in 1850. Lord Crewe, as at present advised, sees no grounds for such an apprehension. That line was not accepted by the Mediating Commissioners, and His Lordship imagines that the evidence upon which they rejected it would weigh equally with the Hague Tribunal. Moreover, it is clear that the Turks do not greatly trust their own evidence, since otherwise they would not contemplate giving the line away in negotia tion. It would seem to His Lordship to be more probable that the Hague Tribunal would fix a line approximating to that of the Mediating Com missioners ; and if the alternatives are to allow the consolidation of Turkish authority in El Katr or to deprive the Sheikh of Mohammera of the district between the Mediating Commissioners’ line and the frontier as locally observed, he would choose the latter as the lesser evil. In conclusion, I am to enquire whether Sir E. Grey is satisfied that it is impossible to reserve the rights of Mohammera as regards any reference to the Hague Tribunal. It does not appear that there has been any material alteration in the status quo between Howeizah and the Shatt-el-Arab since the Treaty of Erzeroum. In other words, there is no case in that region for arbitration, and the situation therefore differs entirely from that on the northern section, where it is precisely the vital nature of the alterations made in recent years that is the cause of the whole difficulty. This essential difference might perhaps be held to justify Persia in informing the Turkish Government (and His Majesty’s Government in supporting her should necessity arise), that while there would be no objection to minor rectifications by the Hague Tribunal of the frontier locally recognised, as compared with the Mediating Commissioners’ line, no award substantially modifying it will be accepted. Copy of a telegram addressed to the Government of India is enclosed: their reply, with any further observations that may be necessary, will be communicated to you in due course.

Foreign Office and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Ofuce, London. fey 16th, 1912. Immediate and Confidential. Sir: - (W) With reference to previous correspondence, I am desirous of calling together a committee, composed of delegates from the India Office, Board of Trade and Foreign'Office, to discuss various questions arising out of the Turkish reply, communicated on April 15th, respecting the Bagdad Railway and cognate questions. The attitude which His Majesty’s Government can most expediently adopt with regard to the distribution of capital in the Bagdad-Bussorah line is a matter which principally calls for the early consideration of the three departments concerned. Another point, which concerns the India Office (W) Government In respect of the Peninsula of El Katr, In a joint minute, dated April 24th. by Sir A. Hirtsel and The Under Secretary of State, India Office .( 16000 / 12 ) and Mr. Parker, the follovving pasbage occurs:- ”It appears to us that there is nothing in the Turkish argument that would Justify His Majesty's Government in abandoning one iota of the claims ad vanced in the memorandum of July 1911, seeing that an important object in embarking on a settlement of Gulf questions was to eliminate the Turks from the peninsula'. Sir E. Grey recognises the cogency of this conclu sion, which appears likely to coincide with the views of the British Resident in the Persian Gulf and trie Government of India. But he is none the less not fully convinced that the desires of the Turkish Government in regard to El Katr should, on account of the British interests in volved, be negatived; he is not persuaded that a con solidation of Turkish influence in El Katr, if stiict- ly defined, is inconsistent witn the maintenance ol British interests direct or indirect; and he is dis- posed to think that thars ara important and desiraole compansations in other quartero which might he procur able for concessions to Turkey here, and that such com pensations cannot otherwise he secured. , _ o+u+p for India is aware, the As the Secretary of b^ate ior Turkish—-(16000/12) Turkish and Persian Governments signed a protocol in December 1911 agreeing, in certain contingencies, to refer the Turco-Persian frontier dispute to the Hague Tribunal. This agreement was concluded under the auspices of the British and Russian Governments. It appears to be generally held that if the dis- nute is referred to this Tribunal, the frontier adjudi cated to Turkey in the Moharamerah region is likely to be more favourable to her than the frontier as locally observed, and consequently less favourable to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. It would, in view of the attitude of His Majesty's Government during 1911, be difficul decline to abide the Turco-Persian negotiations of t for His Majesty's Government to by an arbitral award; and, if that award were prejudicial to the Sheikh of Mohamerah, as indeed it might he even to the extent of the claims advanced hy Dervish Pasha on hehalf of Turkey in 1850, the resulting situation would he one of great perplexity and difficulty. Such being the uncertainty of the case, Sir n-Cney( 16000 / 12 ) is disposed to think that every effort should be made to reach an agreement on the Mohammerah boundary ques tion by direct negotiation with Turkey; but he is not hopeful of the issue of such a negotiation unless His Majesty's Government can offer to Turkey a sub stantial quid pro quo elsewhere, and, in his opinion, it might possibly be found in El Katr. British interests in the peninsula appear to con sist principally in: (a) The maintenance of the grazing rights of the Sheikh of Bahrein. (h) The suppression of the arms traffic. (c) The protection of the pearl industry. (d) The exclusion of Turkish influence from Trucial territory. Sir E. Grey, as at present advised, can perceive no conclusive reason why the maintenance of these interests should he incompatible with the consolida tion of the Turkish position; and, if objections go exist, their importance should, he considers, be weighed in relation to the inconvenience of an ad verse arbitral award on the Mohamerah question. A +From Viceroy, 29th March 1912. Private. Your private telegram of 20th instant.

Nothing but serious prejudice to our interests in the Gulf seems likely to result from such a development. The memorandum of 29th July represents irnducible minimum to our pledge, and I can find nothino- which we can surrender with safety. ^ If it is merely a dislike to the withdrawal of the garrison of El Bidaa, which foims present obstacle in discussion, it might perhaps be possible to safeguard Turkish armour propre by allowing present nominal garrison to stay, there on condition that no Turkish jurisdiction is exercised in 'Katr outside El Bidaa, and that we are allowed to suppress arms traffic there.o Sir, India Office, 29th March 1911. ,, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant on the subject of the Bagdad dated 18th f^ a ^ wa y an( l connected questions, and m reply to enclose copy of telegrams* exchanged with the Government of India. * To Governor-General, March 1911. From ditto, dated 23rd March 1911. 2 A^ mCe y ^ Ur Jetter was written a Convention has been signed between the Ottoman Government and the Anatolian Railway Company whereby the latter relinquishes its concession for the section between Bagdad and the .Persian Gulf, on the understanding that it receives in a new company to be formed a share not less than that of any other non-Turkish Power, and subject to a claim to be indemnified for loss arising out of construction ex penses guaranteed on that section. The conclusion of this Convention no doubt facilitates the opening of negotiations between this country and Turkey. It also, in Viscount Morley’s opinion, removes all inducement to open them. 3. When the written proposals of the Turkish Government were received it was understood that they were not final, but were of a tentative nature, and did not exclude the hope that more favourable terms might be obtained for this country. To any such hope the door is apparently closed by the new convention. It is not probable that in an international company to be formed for promoting a railway on Turksh soil Turkey will consent to reduce her share below the 40 per cent, proposed, and if that is so, unless France is to be practically excluded, it is arithmetically impossible for Great Britain to obtain more than 25 per cent. In 1909 the total trade of Bagdad was 2,918,120h, of which 1,954,0001. belonged to Great Britain and India, or about 67 per cent.; 237,739h to France, or about 8 per cent.; and 65,349L to Germany, or less than per cent. Comment on these figures is unneces sary, and Lord Morley believes that no Government that consented to permit the increased Customs duties in return for participation upon these terms, or upon any terms at all resembling them, could stand before the criticism that would be invoked. 4. This view,—in which there is, no doubt, an element of sentiment— is confirmed by an examination of the question on its merits as a matter of business. From this point of view I am to observe that, apart from pro viding profitable scope for British capital (which is not without scope elsewhere and is not likely to be attracted to an enterprise in which it will have to begin by paying an indemity to the original concessionnaires), the sole measure of the advantage of participation is the control that^ it affords , and the degree of control afforded by a 20 per cent, or even 25 per cent, share is illusory. Nor, on the other hand, does it appear that we stand to lose commercially by non-participation, since, if it is possible to prevent the imposition of differential rates by either of the extraneous means suggeste in your letter (a point on which Lord Morley would be glad to know the views of the Board of Trade), it is no longer necessary to secure any voice at all in in the management of the Company; while, whether it is possible or not, we must look more and more, (Lord Morley is convinced) to the Mohammera-Khorremabad line, if we can secure it, oi t e ex ension of our trade in Western Persia—the more so as trade by the Bagdad route will, if the increased Customs duties are to be the price of British participation, in future be penalised to the extent of approximately 48,0001. a 5. It would appear, therefore, that no commercial advantage is to be anticipated from participation, and Lord Morley is of opinion that, w S. 61. f fiis realised that it is no longer possible for the section to a predominantly British undertaking, that the British share m it is not likely to exceed at the outside 1,000,0001., and that for the privilege of lending this sum to an international company British trade is to be taxed between 300,0001 and 400 0001 a year, no desire to participate in it will be found to exist m financial circles in this country. The conclusion to which he is driven is that for the present it is desirable on commercial grounds to stand aloof. 6. Political considerations appear to point m the same direction. His Lordship does not overlook the arguments stated m paragraph 10 of your letter under reply. But these arguments centre round koweit, and it is precisely Koweit which—if it is to be the terminus—lurkey cannot afford to give up on the only terms which we can afford to accept; Jor alike m t e official Turkish proposals, and in the remarks of Djevad Bey reported m Sir E. Grey’s Despatch to Sir F. Bertie, No. 90, of 14th instant, it is laid down that the terminus must be at a place under Turkish administration. While, therefore, Lord Morley regards a solution of the Koweit difficulty as worth the price’of considerable concessions, provided that the conditions stated m my letter of 3rd March are secured, he is inclined to think that from the Turkish point of view such a solution is necessarily inconsistent with the location of the terminus at that place. And if the terminus is to be elsewhere, Koweit loses much of its importance, and the puce pioposed is far too great to pay. 7. Judging the question therefore, as Sir E. Grey invites him to do, on ££ its merits, and apart from the general effect of non-participation on the ££ international situation,” Lord Morley holds that the balance, inclines markedly to non-participation, and he concurs in the conclusions indicated in the last two sentences of Lord Hardinge’s telegram. 8. It therefore appears to him that every effort should now be made to obtain the Mohammera-Khorremabad concession, and that in the meantime the Turks should be informed in the friendliest terms that His Majesty s Government are unable to accept their proposals regarding the rail way, and that, after careful examination of the situation (profoundly modified as it has been by the recent Convention), they have come to the conclusion that the extension of the line to the Gulf is not worth to them the price which they are asked to pay; and as they do not require the extension in the interests of their own trade, they do not think it necessary to put forward counter proposals. The fact that the Company have relinquished their claim to the increased Customs duties makes it the more easy to adopt this attitude, since the refusal of His Majesty’s Govern ment to consent to them will no longer wear the appearance of hostility to the railway. Lord Morley would propose that His Majesty’s Government should then wait and see the effect of this communication ; but he would urge now, as he urged in October last, that the further advance of Turkish pretensions at Koweit and in the Gulf must be resisted by all means in our power, and that it should be given to the Turks to understand that this attitude will only be relaxed when British interests are adequately recog nised. In view of the Turkish action in respect of Bahrein reported in Sir G. Lowther’s telegram, No. 66, of 25th instant, it seems highly desirable that this should be made clear at the earliest possible date. 9. His Lordship is, however, not unaware that this question cannot be treated entirely as a local matter, but that it must also be considered in connection with our relations with Germany. But that is a subject of which this Office has no immediate cognizance, and he therefore confines himself to remarking (1) that a friendly agreement with Germany appears to him essential before a satisfactory settlement of the Bagdad Railway question can be arrived at, and indeed before the subject can profitably be discussed with Turkey; (2) that the ostensible relinquishment by Germany of the concession for the Gulf section makes it easier for His Majesty’s Government to refuse to facilitate the construction of that section, since such refusal can no longer be interpreted as an unfriendly act to Germany ; (3) that, unlessthe new convention is of a conditional nature, it is more than ever in the interest of Germany that the Gulf section should be expedited since, until this is done the German Company will not receive the indemnity which they are understood to require in order to cover the construction expenses of the more expensive sections of the line. 10. A further communication will be addressed to you in regard to paragraph 17 of your letter when the necessary information has been received from the Government of India. 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, (Signed) R. Ritchie, The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.Sir, India Office, 3rd March 1911. reference to your letter of the 20th January regarding the status of Koweit, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs copy of telegrams exchanged with the Government of India. I am to say that the Earl of Crewe concurs in the opinions expressed bv Lieutenant-Colonel Cox and the Government of India. The necessary conditions antecedent to any concession on the part of His Majesty’s Government with regard to the status of Koweit appear to him to be : — (1.) Ihe securing for His Majesty s Government of predominant control in the Bagdad-Koweit section of the Bagdad Railway, for which purpose he considers 55 per cent, of capital and control inadequate. (2.) A binding assurance that Koweit will be the terminus (3.) The absolute control, jointly with the Sheikh, of the harbour and port both afloat and ashore. (4.) A satisfactory agreement between the Sheikh and the Turkish Government as to the division of customs and transit duties. In return for this, His Majesty’s Government might admit, and advise the Sheikh to admit, Turkish suzerainty over Koweit to the full extent compatible with— (а) The complete autonomy of Koweit in respect of its internal admini stration, to be guaranteed by a firman to the Sheikh, and confirmed by a written undertaking to His Majesty’s Government, as proposed by Colonel Cox. (б) The maintenance of our agreements with the Sheikh. (c) The recognition by Turkey of Um Kasr, Bubiyan, and Warba as part of Koweit territory under Turkish suzerainty, and the withdrawal of Turkish guards and symbols of authority therefrom. A reasonable settlement of all property disputes, the Sheikh taking out Turkish papers for his son, should also be included in the negotiations ; and it would further be understood that if the question of tribute L not raised the Sheikh will approach the division of customs duties, &amp;c., in a liberal spirit. Whether the Turkish Government will be prepared to negotiate on this basis will presumably depend largely upon the value which they attach to considerations mainly of a sentimental order. On the other hand, the con cession which His Majesty’s Government are prepared to make, in facilitating the use of Koweit as a terminus for the Bagdad Railway, is of a very substantial nature ; and, in considering what we may reasonably expect to receive in return, it must be borne in mind that the position which .Has Majesty’s Government have built up for themselves at Koweit, and fortified by formal agreements with the Sheikh, is together with the similar position which they hold at Mohammera-the one solid asset that they possess m those regions, and that they have been, at pains to acquire it precisely for some such purpose as that to which it is now proposed to .pu i , v i e, quite apart from all question of compensation, this same position ma ms i impossible for them (as Mr. Marling has pointed out m his Despatch ISo 14 of «h January last) to abandon the Sheikh to the Turks without such a loss of prestige as would be disastrous to their general policy and interests m the 1 61 For 1 these reasons Lord Crewe would regard the conditions recyiitukted above as essential to a satisfactory settlemen . 13 0 ® , , • negotiations that may be opened great care must be taken to avoid makingany admissions with regard to the status of Koweit that may be used to ou detriment should the whole negotiations prove abortive, or should some place other than Ivoweit eventually he adopted as the terminus. P In conclusion I am to express the hope that any opportunity that otters «—*• •« ■* “ The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. I have, the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, (Signed) R. Ritchie.(i.) The Bagdad Railway Question. On various occasions His Majesty’s Government have indicated the conditions under which they would favour the participation of British capital in this enterprise; and, while it is not now proposed to recapitulate the earlier stages of this question, it may be recalled that in July 1910, as a result of prolonged discussions with the Ottoman Minister of finance who was then in London, it was intimated that an airangement securing to British interests a representation of 55 per cent, of the whole m regard to the Gulf sections of the line might be regarded as a satisfactory solution, and, having regard to the great preponderance of certain interests in other sections ot the line, such a proportion cannot well be looked upon as excessive, especially if the great extent of British trade in those regions and the vast tonnage ot British shipping are borne in mind. Since the arrangement laid before Hjavid Bey represented a large measure of concession on the part of His Majesty’s Government, they have received the suggestions now made by the Ottoman Government with some surprise. Ihe lurkish proposals for the final portions of the railway are that a new company should be formed, and that the capital should be divided between the Ottoman Government, who would receive 40 per cent, of the whole, and British, French, and German groups, who would each receive 20 per cent. The details of the financial arrangements are left for subsequent settlement between the parties interested. His Majesty’s Government regret that they are unable to accept these proposals. If a new company is formed for the construction and working of the railway south of Bagdad, and if it is to be constituted upon an international basis. His Majesty's Government can only accede to such an arrangement provided that British interests are represented in a degree at least equal to that of any other Power, including Turkey, and, in order to effect this and with a view to emphasising the international and commercial character of the undertaking, they would suggest that Russia should be admitted to participation and that the percentage allotted to each country should be 20 per cent. Assuming that this distribution is adopted, His Majesty’s Government consider that a convention should be concluded by the Powers concerned providing for the exclusion of differential rates on any railways in Asiatic Turkey, and for equality of treatment in regard to transport facilities and cognate matters ; for the alignment of the railway south of Bagdad and the conditions under which it is to be constructed; for the introduction of approved financial arrangements tending to foster the develop ment of traffic; and for guaranteeing that the interest in the enterprise of the several parties concerned shall be of lasting duration and not subject to termination on the expiry of the Bagdad Railway concession. It would furthermore be necessary for the Ottoman Government to undertake formally not. to impose river dues on British shipping or cargoes without the assent of His Majesty’s Government. There remains the question of the terminal port: having regard to the fact that important commercial interests are already established at Bussorah, His Majesty’s Government cannot but feel that substantial advantages would accrue from the (establishment of the terminus at that point; and they consider that the port should be constructed and controlled by the proposed new company in the interests of the unrestricted commerce of all nations. But if such an arrangement is adopted, they must stipulate that, in the event of the railway ever being prolonged to the Persian Gulf, it must be brought to Koweit under conditions to be settled by agreement between Great Britain and Turkey alone, and a clause to this effect must be embodied in a convention dealing with these matters. (ii.) The respective Interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the Region of the Persian Gulf. His Majesty’s Government are willing to meet the wish expressed in the concluding laraoraph of the Turkish memorandum that a precise definition may he reached as x&gt; the respective position of the two countries, commercially and politically, in the Persian Gulf; and they see no reason why a lasting settlement of the questions nvolved should not be reached. His Majesty’s Government are m no sense opposed ;o the legitimate claims of the Turkish Government. . The most southerly point to .vhich thev have ever recognised such claims on the littoral ot the 1 eisian Gull isOieir in the district of El Katif. South of this point there is no trace of Turkish power ever having been paramount; in 1870 the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs conveyed to Her Majesty’s Ambassador formal assurances that the Sublime Porte did not'entertain any intention of obtaining supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf ; and it is on y since that C date that certain attempts have been made by the Ottoman Government to establish mudirates and other emblems of Turkish authority at points to the south of Ojeir The position of His Majesty’s Government in regard to _ these^ tribes has been entirely different. With Bahrein they have had direct relations since is 5; these relations have found concrete expression in a series ot treaties dating irom 1820, and having as their objects the suppression of piracy and the slave trade; the regularity of the succession to the throne; the protection of the island against foreign aggression ; and the safety of the pearl industry, of which Bahrein is the centre. In Muscat and the territories of the Trucial chiefs His Majesty’s Government have, in virtue of various treaties and agreements, conferred similar benefits for many years; and their policv in ^aeh ease has been inspired by the importance of upholding tie maritime peace, of securing open markets to the commerce of aJl countries, and ot protecting the long-established interests ol British-Indian subjects. His Maiestv’s Government cannot acquiesce in any arrangement u liicli might restrict or undermine the authority which they have exercised uninterruptedly With such beneficent results; they conceive that any extension of lurkish jurisdiction along the littoral of the Persian Gulf to the south of Ojeir would be prejudicial to those results and unsupported by any legitimate claims of Turkish sovereignty; and they have accordinglv resisted anv attempts which have been made lo encioacii upon these regions. They are therefore of opinion that any lasting settlement between the two Powers must provide for the definite renunciation by the Ottoman Govern- ment of Bahrein and adjacent islands and the whole of the peninsula of HI Katr (including El Bidaa), where the Sheikh of Bahrein has important rights ; and they consider that such a settlement would finally remove a perennial source of local friction. . „ The Ottoman Government express a wish to regularise the relations ot Jxoweit towards the Ottoman Empire, and His Majesty’s Government will gladly contribute to such a solution, on the understanding that their rights and claims are not to be regarded as prejudiced by any proposals which may now be put forward, should such proposals prove abortive. As the Ottoman Government are aware, His Majesty’s Government hawe never admitted that Koweit is under Turkish protection, and, inasmuch as some divergence of opinion was manifested between the two Governments as to the position there, a modus vivenni was reached- in September 1901 by His Majesty s Government con senting to give an assurance that, provided the Turkish Government abstained from sending troops to Koweit and respected the status quo there, they would^ occupy not that place or establish a British protectorate over it. British trade relations with the Sheikhs of Koweit have existed for upwards of two centuries, and, inasmuch as the place has attracted merchants from all quarters by the equity of its rule and the freedom of its trade, His Majesty’s Government could not consent to any interference with the succession^or with the internal administration, or any infringement of the complete autonomy of the sheikh. On the other hand, they are prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Koweit, and to recognise the sheikh as a Turkish kaimakam, provided in other respects the status quo is guaranteed, and the validity of certain agreements which the sheikh has concluded with the British Government is recognised; provided the islands of Warba and Bubian are admitted by Turkey to he within the confines of Koweit, and Turkish military posts are withdrawn ; and provided finally the sheikh is admitted to the lull and undisturbed enjoyment of any properties he may own or hereafter purchase on Turkish territory. Koweit would thus form a sort of enclave within, and forming part of, the Ottoman Empire, hut enjoying complete self-government under Turkish suzerainty. Certain difficulties have recently arisen in regard to the buoyage of the Shatt-el- Arab. Eor a great number of years British shipping has, owing to its volume, been predominantly, and until recently almost exclusively, interested in these aids to navigation. For over fifty years the work of surveying, buoying, and lighting the river has been carried out by British agency to the general satisfaction of all concerned. In these circumstances, His Majesty’s Government have some difficulty in appreciating why the Ottoman Government have taken exception to existing andsp^ri^confilStfon^thPv 48 : beinS desi . rous of dealing with the difficulty in a of a small rivp™in ’ ^ P ro pose to the Ottoman Government the appointment witran en' neer to C r mlS r n 1 ’, C0mp0S f d0f a British and a T ^ ish representative, all matter nert^? ^ mutually agreed upon.

(iii.) The Increase from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem in the Turkish Customs Duties. . Ma J est y’ s Government have consistently maintained that they could in no circumstances assent to the increase in the Turkish customs duties unless a previous question^ 10101 ' 7 Settlement had been cached in regard to the Bagdad Bailway . tlu f att , ltl ^ de tl^y adhere ; and while they consider that such a settlement might be promoted on the lines of an agreement such as has already been indicated, they could not regard a settlement confined to the railway as either satisfactory or complete, since it would leave m a state of uncertainty a number of questions closely affecting British interests m the regions of Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. His Majesty s Government are in principle favourable to railway construction in iurkey ; but they cannot directly contribute to the completion of the Bagdad Bailway * to . m t rod uce a further element of possible disturbance into an area where l \i , and invests have, especially of late, been wontonly assailed; nor do they feel that they could justify to British public opinion the imposition of a tax which will aff ect British trade—amounting in Mesopotamia to some 60 per cent, of the w iole, unless they have provided for a general settlement of political issues in the Peisian Gulf, such as the Ottoman Government themselves desire to bring about, and unless they have obtained some compensation for and a guarantee against the con tinuance of arbitrary acts such as the demolition, on no adequate pretext, of British property in Bagdad. If the Ottoman Government are prepared to enter upon a negotiation on these lines, and to concur, as already stipulated, in a removal of the existing veto on the borrowing powers of Egypt,—a measure which is called for in the interests of financial reform in Egypt,—His Majesty’s Government will make it their fiist aim to con tribute to an agreement likely to remove all causes of friction between the two Powers; and they wall not only consent, subject to the concurrence of other Powers and to the due observance of such agreement, to the further increase of the Turkish customs for a fixed period, but they will likewise agree to the continued levy of the 6 per cent, customs increase, which had only been sanctioned provisionally till the year 1914.

(No. 190. Confidential.) Sir, Pera, March 23, 1911. IN continuation of my despatch No. 183, Confidential, of yesterday’s date, I have the honour to transmit the text of the declaration made by the Bagdad Bailway Company renouncing its rights conditionally to the Bagdad—Gulf section and the ports of Bussorah and the terminus. This was handed to me to-day by Bifaat Pasha, with the assurance that, though not verbatim, it w r as practically the text, and that there was nothing beyond this. His Excellency, in reply to my enquiry as to a rumour to the effect that the Turkish Government had undertaken to keep the German Govern- [156] Ci- y &gt; ment fully informed as to the course of the negotiations with the British Government, declared that there was no truth whatever in the statement. No renouncement of the right to build the port of Bagdad provided for by article 22 of the convention of 1903, appears to have been made on the present occasion, and Rifaat Pasha did not know whether it had been the subject of With regard to the annual sum to be paid by the Turkish Government to the railway company for the construction and working or the Halif-Bagdad section I enclosed a table in my despatch already referred to showing that the amount wou d be about £ T. 400,000, while the surplus receipts assigned by the Government should yield about £ T. 405,000. /-imn n\ t This calculation was, however, based on the returns for one year (1910 11), and 1 have now had a further calculation made, taking the average results of tithe revenue surpluses for five years, without allowing for almost certain increase, which works out at considerably less in favour of the Government, for, as you will see from the enclosed memorandum, instead of there being a slight surplus, there is an apparent msuthciency of £ T. 208,000. This may have some academic interest. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. r Mt Enclosure 1 in No. 3. Declaration by Bagdad Railway Company.

Statement respecting Payments by the Turkish Government to the Bagdad Railway Company. THE revenues to be set aside for the payment of the annuity of the Halif- Bagdad section of the Bagdad Railway are, according to article 2 of the text of the new convention published in the “Tanin” of the 20th instant, the following:— 1. Government share of the surplus of the ceded revenues, not including the 3 per cent, customs surtax. 2. Surplus of the tithes already set aside for the service of the annuity of series 1—Konia-Eregli section. 3. Surplus of the tithe revenues earmarked for the payment of kilometric guarantees of the Anatolian lines, viz., Haidar Pasha-Angora and Eskishehr-Konia. The Government share of the surplus of the ceded revenues for the year 1326 (1910-11), excluding the customs surtax of 3 per cent., is estimated at £ T. 600,000, and which may be taken as a basis for calculation. 2.— Surplus of Tithes for first 200 kilom. of Bagdad Railway — Konia-Eregli Section. The annuity for this section is £ T. 97,118'90. To meet this the Government has assigned the following revenues :— To be paid annually out of the tithes of the sanjaks of Aleppo and Urfa From the tithes of the kaza of Tcheshme, Smyrna province ,, Hille, Bagdad province .. ,, Mardin, Diarbekir province „ Mosul, Mosul province ..The annual collection of these revenues since 1905-6 has only once exceeded the annuity, and has never reached the amount estimated by Government.

It is, however, more than probable that the tithe revenues of the districts mentioned are considerably more than the fixed amount shown as the contributions of each district, This assumption is confirmed by the figures of tithe returns given in the official almanac (Salnameh) of the Aleppo province for the vear 1324 (1908-9) the tithes of the— Piastres £ T.

It is now circulated for convenience of reference.] No. 4. Memorandum communicated in substance to the German Imperial Chancellor on December 1, 1910. (Enclosure in Sir E. Grey’s despatch No. 312, Secret, of November 23, 1910, to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Berlin.) (Confidential.) SPEAKING on the 11th October to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Berlin, the Imperial Chancellor mentioned four instances in which German interests had been systematically opposed by His Majesty’s Government, viz. :— 1. The Turkish loan ; 2. The Bagdad Railway ; 3. Persia ;. and 4. The Algeciras Conference. It wdll be convenient to reproduce, in italics, the substance of the criticisms made by Herr von Betbmann-Hollweg ; and to subjoin, in ordinary type, the observations to which those criticisms severally give rise. 1. The Turkish Loan. “In the question of the Turkish loan His Majesty’'s Government had set themselves in opposition to Germany, and had, as it appeared to the Imperial Government, supported the recent efforts of France to replace the Dette publique by the Ottoman Bank, notwithstanding the fact that such an arrangement must be as distasteful to Great Britain as to Germany.” His Majesty’s Government, in the month of September, expressed to the Erench Government their concurrence in the view that it would be only prudent to make an advance to Turkey conditional upon some satisfactory form of control, and also upon adequate guarantees that the loan should not be wholly swallowed up in unproductive expenditure. Such reservations appeared to His Majesty’s Government eminently desirable, not only in the interests of Turkish credit and of all Turkish bondholders of whatever nationality, but also with a view to avoiding, if possible, undue encourage ment at a critical moment to those influences in Turkey which might make for disturbance of peace. On the other hand, His Majesty’s Government have never wittingly supported efforts to replace the Public Debt Administration by the Ottoman Bank. Inthes.e circumstances, tlis Majesty’s Government are at a loss to appreciate how their attitude in this question has been one of opposition to Germany. At the date (11th October) of the Imperial Chancellor’s remarks no indication had been vouchsafed to His Majesty s Government as to the views of the German Government regarding the Turkish loan question, and it was on receipt of Sir E. Goschen’s despatch recording those remarks that they learnt for the first time that such views existed at all, though they still have no certain knowledge as to what they may be, unless indeed it is to be inferred that the contentions of Turkey in regard to borrowing operations in Paris and London are in fact the contentions of the German Government. Upon such an assumption alone does the criticism of Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg appear to be intelligible. 2. The Bagdad Railway. T.he Bagdad Railway question, the Chancellor said, was another case in point. The Imperial Government had endeavoured to come to an arrangement with regard to the southern section of the railway: their proposals had not only been rejected by His Majesty’s Government, but the latter had also tried to put obstacles in the way of the German projects by refusing to support the raising of the Turkish customs dues on the ground that part of the sums realised by that increase would find its way to the concessionnaires of the Bagdad kailway. Nevertheless, this attitude of hostility to the German Bagdad Railway had not prevented His Majesty’s Government jrom supporting the French scheme for a Bagdad Railway, projected by M. Tardieu.”His MatestvVr^vp 06 app , ear . s ^ 0 .^°, ( : us the Ger man representation of the attitude of such censure should ^corrected. mdl5pensable that the misconception which underlies consiructh^afs,?i HiS G. 0Te ™m^t ^ not one of opposition to railway oriein it is moreover 1 f stmctlon enterprises of German and french nofaggress^e bTdefens“ve° ' C ° nCernS Bagdad Co -“ tio11 of M T S °r ar a ?.? ls ^jesty’s Hov^ernment are aware, the proiect referred to as that of OrOnTed IT X me / n r ery d i efinite f0r “ but be tbis - TmayThey have nevei denied that railway development is essential to the prosperity of the Turkish Steble n British nTtT^T* 11 ^ 17 preP T d t0 welcome &gt; P^de/ the terms were acceptable, -British paiticipation in any railway—whether proiected by M Tardieu or Gulf aefwt^T be . c , on ®tr u cte d between the Mediterranean Ld the Persian been’snTf f -i firmed , m ttendenc y because—such participation not having been satisfactorily arranged under the concession of 1903-it could not appear shoTTf™* t0 V' 18 mterests^ that all railway communication in Mesopofamia should be a monopoly under the virtual control of one nationality t So , much for t 110 . PO'my.of His Majesty’s Government in regard to railway constmction in general: il their attitude, based upon the entirely legitimate object the t e “ dln S Butls b molests, is not actively favourable to the concession of 1903, e justification ot that attitude mast be sought in rhe peculiar conditions of the concession and the circumstances in which it is proposed to exploit it. To this aspect of the questionimthey reference will presently be made; iu the first place, however, it is convenient, to indicate in some detail what are the interests which His Majesty’s Government have to defend m the regions in question. The commercial position of Great Britain in the Mesopotamian delta is altogether exceptional: that position has been steadily consolidated since the foundation, upwards .^ v l ° a. f kflf centuries ago, of the first English factory at Bussorah ; in 1766 a J utish Resident was appointed at Bagdad; at Bussorah there has long been a British consul, charged with the care of British trade, represented up to a recent date by 96 per cent, ot the steam tonnage entered at the port; in short, such is now the nature of these commercial interests that the trade of Bagdad and Bussorah, valued at 2,500,000/. in 1903, is predominantly in the hands of British and Indian merchants: moreover, it may be mentioned incidentally that the annual pilgrimage of British-Indian subjects to the Shirah shrines of Iverbela and Nejef is continually increasing, the numbers in 1905 exceeding 11,000,—a circumstance which serves to emphasise the interest which this region must possess for British-Indian traders and commerce. The position attained by this country upon the waters and on the shores of the Bersian Gulf has been won not without the expenditure of many millions of money and the sacrifice of many valuable lives ; in the early years of the nineteenth century the slave trade was rampant in the Gulf, and the vessels of the Indian Marine were engaged in a long and arduous struggle with the Arab pirates who infested its southern coasts: this conflict, which was conducted entirely by British agency and means, resulted in the establishment; of treaty relations with the Arab chiefs, under which they bound themselves to observe perpetual peace and to refer all disputes to the British Resident at Bushire. The pax Britannica which has ever since, with rare exceptions, been maintained, is the issue of these arrangements and is the exclusive work of this country. It is owing to British enterprise, to the expenditure of British lives and money, that the Persian Gulf, not excluding the approaches to the Turkish ports of Bagdad and Bussorah, is at this moment open to the navigation of the world: indeed, to these causes alone it may be said that the. seaborne trade of Mesopotamia owes its very existence. The situation of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf has been well described as unique: for although she has not sought territorial acquisitions in those regions, she has for generations borne burdens there which no other nation has ever undertaken anywhere, except in the capacity of sovereign; she has had duty thrust upon her without dominion; she has kept the peace amongst people who are not her subjects ; has patrolled, during upwards of two centuries, waters over which she has enjoyed no formal lordship ; has kept, in strange ports, an open door through which the traders of every nation might have as free access to distant markets as her own. Such are the interests, such is the historical position, which His Majesty’s Govern ment are called upon to uphold : it may indeed be confidently asserted that no European Bower is concerned in these regions, by reason of long-established interest and influence, to the same extent as this country: and when, moreover, it is borne in mind that the [156] Dmost direct route to the East has always in the past been controlled by the Rulers of India—that the Portuguese acquired Algoa and Delagoa Bays as ports of call to and from Goa, that the Dutch East India Company established a fort at lable Bay in lbS2 for a similar purpose, that the Cape was subsequently, in 1814, ceded to the British Crown, and that the port of Aden was occupied by the British as an outpost of India-— when all this is taken into consideration, it cannot give rise to surprise if His Majesty s Government—though they emphatically disclaim any desire to disturb the territorial status quo —regard with some measure of concern the advent of a great trans-continental railway under the cegis of a foreign Power, accompanied by a rigorous exclusion of British control and its consequent effect upon the Oriental mind. The Bagdad Railway Convention of 1903, apart altogether from the financial clauses, is no commonplace concession—it confers rights of wide and exceptional nature: thus the promoters of the enterprise not only are entitled to establish ports at the important trade centres of Bagdad and Bussorah, but under various articles a number of minor but valuable rights are conferred upon them : exemption from customs dues for all materials, machinery, rolling-stock, iron, wood, coal imported from abroad during the period of construction, and exemption from taxation of the company’s entire property and revenue during the whole term of the concession ; mining and quarrying and forest rights within a zone of 20 kiloru. on either side of the railway; the right to establish warehouses, elevators and shops; to manufacture bricks and tiles, and to make free use of any natural water power in the vicinity of the line—all tending to confer a monopoly of the economic development of the country. Having regard to certain clauses of the “ cahier des charges,” His Majesty’s Government do not contend that it is proposed to establish differential rates against British trade; but they do apprehend that, in practice if nor in theory, the advent of this railway, with its great terminal ports, the whole under German control, must react adversely upon British trade interests in Mesopotamia, while German commerce, supported by the great local organisation of the railway and its powerful officials, will almost inevitably compete with weighted dice. But the Bagdad Railway concession, as has been urged in Germany as well as in England, is a political enterprise ; it is not exclusively commercial; it will have an undoubted and important political influence upon the primitive minds of the Arab population, not to mention the natives of British India; and finally it is based upon such remarkable financial guarantees, that it is in the interests of the Turkish Exchequer, as the Turkish Government themselves contend, that no other railway concessions should be granted in the adjoining regions : it must in fact be a monopoly. His Majesty’s Government have no wish to enter here upon a detailed discussion as to those financial guarantees: they would confine themselves to the general comment that whereas the construction annuity appears to be more than sufficient even if due regard be had to the cost of crossing the Taurus and to the substantial character of the permanent way, on the other hand the working expenses guarantee is apparently arranged upon such a scale that it actually militates against the progressive development of traffic. Reither of these results is perceptibly advantageous to the Turkish taxpayer. In view of all these considerations. His Majesty’s Government frankly admit that they have not been able, for the reason indicated by the Imperial Chancellor, to accede to an additional duty being imposed upon British commerce: they believe that they would not be justified in assenting to this measure if, in effect, it were to hasten the completion of the Bagdad Railway under existing conditions—conditions which involve the total exclusion of British control in the enterprise. Thus the attitude of His Majesty’s Government is, as has already been contended, defensive and not aggressive. It may be that the construction of the railway can be completed without any British participation; but it is not for His Majesty's Govern ment actively to co-operate to this end at the expense of British commerce. It remains to consider the Imperial Chancellor’s grievance that the German Government have attempted to reach an arrangement with regard to the southern section of the railway, but that their proposals have been rejected by His Majesty’s Government. On three occasions proposals have been adumbrated from the German side. (1.) In 1903 the proposals, it will be recalled, had reference to the whole railway ; these proposals, if accepted, would have secured the assistance of British capital while involving the exclusion ot British control in any effective degree. (2.) In the autumn of 1907, as a result of prolonged discussions at Windsor, itwas virtually agreed, as appears from the records made at the time, that negotiations on the subject of the Bagdad Railway should take place a quatre between Great Britain, Germany, Russia, and France; and it was recognised as both legitimate and natural that His Majesty’s Government should wish to proceed in full consultation with France and Russia. In pursuance of this understanding, Herr von Schoen called at the Foreign Office on the 15th November and saw Sir E Grey : his Excellency expressed great satisfaction at the prospect of now coming to an agreement with His Majesty’s Government on the subject, and recognised their desire to have a “ gate ” at the Persian Gulf end : he further admitted that a memorandum communicated at Windsor formed a practicable basis ior discussion. Sir E. Grey assumed that His Majesty’s Government should wait till they heard further from the German Government; and Herr von Schoen replied that he must in the first instance consult the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, in order to ascertain whether full discussion might not be begun between the four Powers without first carrying discussion with Russia a stage further. On the 25th June, 1908, seven months later, the German Ambassador called at the Foreign Office and stated that his Government had renounced the idea of summoning a conference a quatre at Berlin: his Excellency further professed that he himself had always strongly opposed such an arrangement, upon the ground that such discussion was foredoomed to failure and would only serve to accentuate the difference between Germany and the three other Powers. (5.) Finally, in the autumn of 1909, Herr von Gwinner intimated to Sir H. Babington-Smith at Constantinople that he was desirous to have British co-operation in the Bagdad Railway ; and, in consequence, certain discussions relating to British participation in the southern section of the line, and in regard to British control of the terminal port, took place between Sir E. Cassel and Herr von Gwinner at Berlin. These discussions, as the German Government are aware, were only interrupted in consequence of the attitude of the Imperial Government themselves, who intimated that political factors were involved. Such then are the causes which have rendered all negotiation for British participation in the Bagdad Railway ineffective : the concession has been obtained by Germany, and from her must come definite proposals for British participation if it is decided that it should be admitted. 3. Persia. “As reyards Persia, during last spring the Imperial Government, whose interests in that counrry were purely commercial, had made the most self-denying and considerate proposals to His Majesty’s Government. What had been the result? They had received no reply. On the contrary, His Majesty s Government had stood side by side with Russia, and by exercising pressure on the weak Persian Governmfnt had endeavoured to reduce German commercial relations with that country to the narrowest possible limit. Fne Imperial Government had asked that German subjects might have a fair participation in posts under the Persian Government. There, again, American subjects had been accepted, while the applications of German subjects had been steadily refused:’ It is only accurate to sav that His Majesty’s Government have given no written mlv to the proposals of the German Government made last spring. On the 31st May ir E Grey told the German Ambassador his views verbally, pointing out how npossible it would be for His Majesty’s Government to make an arrangement with ermanv in regard to railway construction in Persia, unless it included a satisfactory ;ttlenient as to British participation in the Bagdad Railway. The remarks of Count Letternich who, it is true, did not profess to be speaking under instructions from is Government, were so unfavourable to this view of the question that it can hardly B gajd that His Majesty’s Government received much encouragement to press forward ^HisMaiesty’s Government cannot subscribe to the view that, by exercising ressure on tire weak Persian Government, Great Britain and Buss,a have endeavoured reduce German comm,rani relations with Persia to the narrowest possible limits, n the 31^ May Sir E. Grey informed the German. Ambirssador oMhe action before ie Persian Government should enter into an exchange ol vn,vv &amp;and Russia in order that the political and strategic interests of the two Powers might be duly safeguarded. . The fact is that Russia and Great Britain are, from geographical considerations, vitally interested in the political and strategical aspects of such concessions in Persia; moreover, it is now twenty years since the Persian Government gave to Her Majesty’s Government an assurance that if any railway concession were given to f Russia in the north of Persia, a concession for a line in the south should simul taneously he given to a British company. His Majesty’s Government can only repeat that they have no wish whatever to exclude German or any other commerce from Persia ; they adhere to the principle of the open door in regard to that country. .Finally, there is the complaint that Americans are considered eligible for posts under the Persian Government, while the applications of German subjects for such posts have been steadily refused. The Persian Medjliss, in September last, decided in favour of Americans ; and the view of the British and Russian Governments has been that the engagement of Americans is unlikely to give rise to political considerations, inasmuch as they are not subjects of a Great European Power. 4. Algecikas Conference. “At Algeciras, Great Britain had supported France in her aspirations for a monopoly of political influence, notwithstanding the fact that Germany had gone there to maintain the old British principle of the open door” If the German delegates at the Algeciras Conference found themselves in opposi tion to their British colleague, this was the inevitable result of the German Government at the time pursuing a policy in regard to Morocco which His Majesty’s Government were precluded from supporting by the express stipulations of the Anglo- French Declaration of the 8th April, 1904. Under that Declaration, as the Marquess of Lansdowne had occasion to remind the German Ambassador here, Great Britain, whilst making no attempt to dispose of the rights of other Powers, did make certain important concessions in respect of the rights and opportunities to which she was herself entitled.* It was provided in article 2 that— “ His Britannic Majesty’s Government for their part recognise that it appertains “ to France more particularly, as a Power whose dominions are conterminous “ for a great distance with those of Morocco, to preserve order in that “ country and to provide assistance for the purpose of all administrative, “ economic, financial, and military reforms which it may require.” And article 9 further stipulated that— “ I he two Governments agree to afford to one another their diplomatic support in “ order to obtain the execution of the clauses of the present declaration.” The German Government could therefore be under no illusion as the binding nature of the obligation which lay on this country, to support France in her Moroccan policy so long as that policy was in conformity with the principles embodied in the Declaration. That Great Britain, in setting her hand to that instrument, in no way disregarded or ignored German interests in Morocco, w’as frankly and explicitly acknowledged by Prince Biilow when he made his speech in the Reichstag on the 13th ^November, 1904. His Majesty’s Government cannot therefore with justice be reproached for unfriendliness to Germany merely because they acted loyally up to their solemn engagements under the Declaration. In the autumn of 1908, when Great Britain contended that international treaties ought not to be altered arbitrarily without the consent of the Powers parties to them, the German Government gave no support to this contention, but on the contrary lent their active support to Austria, though there was no public instrument obliging them to do so. I might therefore have complained then of the action of the German Government with more reason than they now complain of our action at Algeciras. But I did not make any complaint, as I understood the delicacy of their situation. o * To Sir F.

' [April 24.] ~ “ 1 £ c -2 CONFIDENTIAL. ! ° | O [16000] No. 1. Section 1, Joint Minute by Sir A. Rirtzel and Mr. Parker on the Turkish Government's Memorandum communicated on April 15, 1912. 1. Bagdad Bailway. (a.) Division of Share-capital in the Bagdad Bussorah Section. HIS Majesty’s Government originally proposed, in July 1910, that British interests should be represented by 55 per cent, of the total share-capital. Turkey replied that she would prefer a distribution of 40 per cent, for herself, of 20 per cent, to Germany, 20 per cent, to France, and 20 per cent, to England. To this, in July 1911, His Majesty’s Government made a counter-proposal that the distribution should be 20 per cent, each to Turkey, France, Germany, England, and Russia; the idea being to secure 60 per cent., or a majority, to the 3 Entente Powers : England, France, and Russia. Turkey now professes to fall in with the* British view, by distributing the capital equally between herself, France, Germany, and England, in the proportion of 25 pei cent, each, the Chairmanship and casting vote being reserved to Turkey! No mention is made of Russia; but, in our informal discussions, the Turks intimated that they would not willingly admit Russia, and that, if His Majesty s Government persisted, they would have to introduce another country, say Switzerland, to countei balance her. The effect of giving 25 per cent, to each of four Powers, and allotting to Turkey a casting vote, would be to place control in the hands of the Turco-German group, in so far as control does actually depend on the percentage of capital probably does depend upon the voting rights of the various sections of shareholders in so far as the appointment of a manager''' and other high officials and simi ai matters are concerned. But though the control to be exercised by the Board of Directors will not be absolute (since it is proposed to fix by Convention the maximum and minimum scales of tariff rates and many details regarding transport facilities), and it is therefore possible to attach too great importance to the distribution of the share-capital as a means of control, we cannot recommend acceptance _ of the Turkish proposal w ich we believe would be generally regarded as politically a defeat of His Majesty s Government, while financially the small amount of British capital that would find employment would cause great disappointment. . i ™ P Sir H. Babington-Smith has expressed his belief that Turkey, on the analogy of hei holding in the Bagdad Railway, which is only 10 per cent, would be satisfied with a sharf of 10 per cent, or 15 per cent, in the Bagdad-Bussorah section, and he appeals to have discussed the subject with the Turkish Ambassador ln , L „ ^^££6^ tous to think that his impression is erroneous ; since the T urkls b Q f gf ™ that Turkey, as the territorial Power, was already ma g g .... d limiting he/share to the same amount as that of the other Powers paiticipa g Djdvad Bey has since forcibly expressed the samejmw “ ‘ j f ffig Ma j esty - g Governmmit ^ t Jur lowers, a deadloci i/ay ^ ' 1 ““' h?-—“ r'££ Government might perhaps reply tha ^ , x , t t p ev therefore revert to the * We might stipulate that the Manager should be British. R [2435 aa—1]would be in a position nominally superior to the foreign countries, and this would make the agreement more acceptable to the Ottoman Parliament. But we anticipate great reluctance on the part of Turkey to any arrangement admitting Russian participation. We have already expressed the view that the control to be exercised by the Board will be unusually circumscribed; but, such as it is, it will, in so far as it is to serve British interests, be dependent upon the continued solidarity of the Entente Powers. The proposal made by His Majesty’s Government last July' is based upon the assumption that, during the whole period of the concession—that is, for 99 years at ] eas t—the general policy of His Majesty’s Government and the Governments of France and Russia will be such as to insure concerted action on the railway Board, and it presupposes that the Governments concerned will be able to control the policy of their financiers, which in the case of France at least is more than doubtful. We venture to suggest that it may in future prove inconvenient that our interests should depend upon the co-operation of France and Russia on the Board, since the necessity of insuring concerted action by the three Powers in Mesopotamia may handicap British policy in other quarters. Moreover, it must be remembered that Russian commercial interests are here contrary to our own, since the value of this section to us—at all events for many years to come—lies in the fact that it will enable us more easily to pour our goods into Western and Northern Persia where at present Russia is our only rival. We are accordingly far from being persuaded that it is in the interests of this country to insist upon Russian participation in the Bagdad-Bussorah section ; and we venture to think that it would be better to provide for the Russian Government by participation in the Khanikin branch, to which, on terms, the German Government might assent, though the last-mentioned consideration applies to this course also. It must not be overlooked that Turkey is not altogether a free agent in regard to the distribution of capital, since the Bagdad Railway Company has reserved the right to a share equal to that obtained by any foreign country in the Bagdad- Bussorah sections. ▼ (b.) Proposed international convention providing for the exclusion of differential rates on any raihoays in Asiatic Turkey; for the alignment of the railway south of Bagdad, and the conditions under which it is to he constructed ; a?id for guaranteeing that the interest in the enterprise of the several parties concerned shall he of lasting duration and not subject to termination on the expiry of the Bagdad Bailivay Company s concession. No specific mention is made in the Turkish reply of the “ international convention” which His Majesty’s Government desire, but we understood from the Turkish delegates that no objection would he raised to it. \\ ith regard to the exclusion of differential treatment, the Turkish Government declare themselves ready to assure to British commerce all facilities compatible with the agreements already concluded by Turkey with the Bagdad Railway Company. This limitation no doubt principally refers to the “ Cahier des Charges” or specification attached to the Bagdad Railway Convention of 1903, and there is some force in the contention of the Turkish Government that their hands are tied so far as concerns rates on the Bagdad Railway. The specification is composed of technical details, and it would be well to ask the Board of Trade and Government of India to cause an expert examination of the schedule of rates to be made, so as to ascertain whether they are of a nature to serve or to militate against British-Indian trade. At first sight the Turkish reply on this point, the exclusion of differential rates, seems satisfactory. Sir H. Babington-Smith has suggested that it is of great importance to provide that the facilities and rates on the Khanikin branch shall be the same for goods arriving from the Gulf as for those arriving from the Mediterranean. In this view we entirely agree. I he Turkish Government are ready to meet His Majesty’s Government in regard to the alignment and the financial arrangements, subject to the arrangement of details. On the other hand, they say that they are not prepared to agree to the arrangement to be arrived at for the Bagdad-Bussorah sections being of lasting duration, instead of subject to termination on the expiry of the Bagdad Railway concession. I his is a point of some importance ; and we do not think His Majesty’sGovernment would be well advised in modify the attitude they have taken up on this question. In any case, if the principle of re-purchase by the Turkish Government is admitted, the exercise of such a right should be made subject to an undertaking that the present agreement in regard to the exclusion of differential treatment should not be departed from.* (c.) Pecuniary^ indemnity to be paid to the Bagdad Pailway Company in respect of its renunciation of the right to construct the section of the railway between Bagdad and the Persian Gulf. The Turkish Government say that this charge must be borne by the proposed new company for the railway south of Bagdad. It was always supposed that this would be so; and we cannot well object. Indeed, Sir H. Babington-Smith has pointed out that this is really Turkey’s affair: Germany claims 2,000Z. for each kilometre abandoned by her ; and Sir H. Babington-Smith has suggested that Turkey would do well to offer bonds of the face value of 2,000Z. in place of cash, especially since the value of these bonds has fallen about 10 per cent, during the present war. (d.) Piver Dues. It seems equitable that Turkey should impose such dues for services rendered in dredging and such like operations in the Shatt-el-Arab; but we propose to discuss this point further in relation to the proposed riverain commission. (e.) Prolongation of the Pailway from Bussorah to the Persian Gulf. His Majesty’s Government proposed, and Turkey agrees, that the best terminus for the moment would be Bussorah. But His Majesty’s Government further proposed that, in the event of the railway ever being prolonged to the Persian Gulf, it must be brought to Koweit under conditions to be settled by agreement between Great Britain and Turkey alone, and that a clause to this effect must be inserted now in a convention dealing with these matters. Turkey replies that there is no present cause for contemplating a continuation of the railway beyond Bussorah, but that, nevertheless, the Turkish Government are prepared to give to His Majesty’s Government all assurances necessary to disperse any anxieties which may be felt concerning the continuation in question. His Majesty’s Government have every reason to insist upon a settlement of this question now, when they are negotiating for a general settlement, and possess the powerful lever of the customs increase. The Turkish delegates have represented that Turkey could not agree to the terminus of this Turkish line being under the control of either an Arab Sheikh or a foreign Power. The Turkish point of view is intelligible ; and it was partly owing to the difficulty of finding a satisfactory solution otherwise that His Majesty’s Government suggested that the railway should stop at Bussorah. We think therefore that His Majesty’s Government should maintain the view, in which the Turkish Government acquiesce, that the principal terminus should be at Bussorah, and that the prolongation to the Gulf should merely be regarded as a branch. But there is some danger that the Turkish Government might, if they could not secure arrangements satisfactory to them at Koweit, bring the Gulf branch to Um Kasr or elsewhere, and that the Sheikh of Koweit might deplore such a development. The Sheikh seemed gratified in 1907 when His Majesty’s Government concluded the lease of the foreshore, as he interpreted the transaction as a clear indication that the terminus of the Bagdad Bailw 7 ay would be at Koweit, and consequently that the commercial wealth of the port would be increased. But we would not attach too great weight to this consideration provided that the Sheikh’s position is secured. We accordingly think it important that the Turkish Government should be induced to bind themselves to bring the branch from Bussorah to the Gulf, if and when constructed, to Koweit under conditions to be settled at tne time between Turkey and Great Britain; but that the position of Bussorah, as the real terminus, * I understood them to say that if the Bagdad Railway Concession were extended, the other should be extended also. Could we not compromise on that ?—A. II. I agree. A. t. [2435 cm —1] B 2should be emphasised, and that the continuation to Koweit should be characterised as a branch line in the further negotiations with Turkey. (f.) Proposed construction and control of the port at Bussorah by the new railway company in the interests of the unrestricted commerce of all nations. Turkey ignores, in her reply, the question of the construction and control of the terminal port at Bussorah. . The Turkish delegates did, however, intimate to ns verbally that turkey would agree to the construction of the port at Bussorah by the new company. They did m + 1 not mention control; and probably such measures as police control would have to remain, as at present, in Turkish hands. But it is desirable that control of the port should be entrusted to the proposed riverain commission. . , , *JlA 2.—Political and Territorial Questions. (See map annexed.) (a.) El Katr. Here there is complete divergency between the Turkish and the British point of view. j The Turkish Government have maintained a post at El Bidaa for 40 years; and the Turkish Delegates have emphasised the difficulty there would be in reconciling parliamentary opinion to the abandonment of territory wnich Turkey has never formally renounced; and they represented that such a surrender would be particularly difficult to justify at a time when public opinion is smarting under the loss of Tripoli. They there fore urged that British interests might be reconciled with a consolidation of Turkish dominion in El Katr; but from this view the British Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Government of India emphatically dissent. It appears to us that there is nothing in the Turkish agreement that would justify His Majesty’s Government in abandoning one iota of the claims advanced in the memo randum of July 1911, seeing that an important object, in embarking on a settlement of Gulf questions was to eliminate the Turks from the peninsula. We consider that His Majesty’s Government should protest energetically against the Turkish attempt to whittle away the assurances (see Annexe I) given by the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, and repeatedly given, to the effect that Turkey did not entertain any intention of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, and the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf; though Turkey did (in the person of Midhat Pasha) argue that there were no independent tribes in Nedjd. (b.) Bahrein. The Turkish reply on this point is, we think, fairly satisfactory. We understood from the Turkish delegates that Turkey is prepared to agree to Bahreinis having British Consular protection in Turkey, hut not rights under the Capitulations, and this appears a reasonable attitude. (c). Zakhnuniyeh Island. According to the Turkish delegates this isle is connected at low tide with the mainland. It is however opposite a portion of the mainland which is south of Ojeir, the most southerly limit to which His Majesty’s Government have ever recognised Turkish influence, and this attempt to establish themselves on the island seems to date only from 1909. (d.) Koweit. The Turkish reply evades a direct answer to much that was written in the British memorandum of July 1911. We consider that no useful purpose would be served by entering into a controversy as to past history, and that it would be expedient to reply to the Turkish Government that, while His Majesty’s Government cannot accept or admit the justice of the Turkish contentions, they would be glad to learn whether the Turkish Government are c&lt; ii tprepared to accept the settlement suggested by His Majesty’s Government last July, in the following paragraph :— British trade relations with the Sheikhs of Koweit have existed for upwards of two centuries and, inasmuch as the place has attracted merchants from all quarters by the equity , \d its rule and the freedom of its trade, His Majesty’s Government could not consent to any interference with the succession or with the internal administration, or any infringement of the complete autonomy of the Sheikh. On the other hand, they are prepared to recognise Turkish suzei'ainty over Koweit, and to recognise the Sheikh as a Turkish Kaimakam, provided in other respects the status quo is guaranteed, and the validity of certain agreements which the Sheikh has concluded with the British Government is recognised; provided the islands of Warba and Bubian are admitted by Turkey to be within the confines of Koweit, and Turkish military posts are withdrawn ; and provided finally the Sheikh is admitted to the full and undisturbed enjoyment of any properties he may own or hereafter purchase on Turkish territory. Koweit would thus form a sort of enclave within, and forming part of, the Ottoman Empire, but enjoying complete self-governmemt under Turkish suzerainty. AsTegards the limits of Koweit it may be mentioned that in 1908 and again in 1910 the British agents toured over the whole of the country claimed by His Majesty’s Government without finding traces of any influence there except that of the Sheikh. But for the moment it is perhaps unnecessary to make any further reference to this subject, though unless the limits are eventually defined misunder standing is certain to arise. Meanwhile we consider that the Turkish Government should be informed that His Majesty’s Government could not agree to conclude an arrangement with Turkey if the military post is maintained at Buhiyan Island; and we consider that it would be impracticable to transfer our agreements with the Sheikh in the manner suggested in the Turkish reply. (e.) Riverain Commission for the Shatt-el-Arab. Instead of the joint Commission proposed by His Majesty’s Government, the Turkish Government suggest an Ottoman Commission, with a British engineer on it in the service of the Turkish Government, in order to avoid the appearance of internationalisation which it is their interest (and ours) to avoid. We understood from the delegates that the Commission would consist of two members only, and that the British representative would be in every respect equal to his Turkish colleague, and further that he would be free to correspond with the British Government as he pleased. Provided that his rights are secured by the Convention, and that it is also arranged that the two Governments shall agree as to the individual to be appointed, we think this may be accepted. But His Majesty’s Government’s further proposal that the executive engineer should he British should be insisted on. As soon as this Commission does any real work, the question of dues must come up, though so long as the expenditure is small, it may be possible to avoid it. But if the ownership of the Shatt is on other grounds adjudged to Tuikey, the Turkish right to levy dues is undeniable, and if the dues are fixed by a Commission, constituted as proposed, its exercise seems harmless. The Turkish Government would undertake that there shall be no differential treatment of British shipping, and this should be embodied in the Convention. The Board of Trade might be asked to advise as to any other conditions that may be necessary. . .. The Turkish delegates were anxious that it should be understood that all pilotage in the Shatt-el-Arab would be controlled by the Commission, and this may be agreed to. (f.) Pilotage, &amp;c., in the Gulf. This is not mentioned in the Turkish reply, and His Majesty s Government should repeat their claim to control it themselves. At the same tme it seems desirable to define the limits of territorial waters, on the basis of the Govern India’s telegram of the 18th April, and a chart on wh,ol CCCmCd theCttW might form an annex to the Convention. It would be agreed that any of the existing British buoys, &amp;c., or of those about to be laid down by us, which might be found to be in Turkish waters, would pass with the control of the Kiveram Commission. (g.) Policing of the Gulf.a s well as from the general attitude of the Turkish delegates, that what the Turks are aiming at is, under the proposed settlement, not only to secure what they already possess on sufferance, but also to obtain a footing which they have never had before. Now whatever may be said from the point of view of law, history, or policy, for the^ former aim, there is clearly no justification for the latter, and His Majesty’s Govern- * ment, whose whole object is to get the Turks, as far as possible, out of the Gulf, can clearly, in no circumstances, acquiesce in it. We submit that this should be made quite plain, and it might be well to remind the Turks of Lord Lansdowne’s statement m the House of Lords on the 5th May, 1903, that “ we should regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf, by any other Power as a very gra-vG niGiiacG to British interests, and we should certainly resist it with a 1 the means at our disposal.” The next step would seem to act as suggested under (a) on p. 4.

YOU asked me to let yon know privately, as soon as possible after we bad received your reply, whether I thonght the proposals of your Government were likely to prove acceptable. As you only communicated the reply on the 15th April, there has not been time to submit it to Sir E. Grey ; but I may tell you now, though purely as my own personal view, that I am greatly disappointed and, after what passed at our informal discussions, not a little surprised at the terms of your official reply. When contrasted with the terms of the British memorandum of last July, the Ottoman reply seems to show, on almost all the principal points, marked divergency, and I cannot conceal from you that I apprehend grave and insuperable objection to some of your proposals. I think that a very bad impression will be produced by the attempt which is made to whittle away the formal assurances which were given by the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs to our Ambassador in 1870 ; those assurances, though verbal, were repeatedly given, and were referred to in subsequent correspondence. I can show 3 mu the original signed despatches from our Ambassador at Constantinople. Then as to Koweit : I had been led to expect that, while the Ottoman Government might feel some reluctance to withdraw the military post from Bubiyan Island, the remaining proposals included in our memorandum of last July respecting Koweit furnished the basis of an agreement between the two countries. I must confess that a great stretch of the imagination appears necessary to reconcile the basis of agreement proposed in your reply with the determination of His Majesty’s Government not to consent “ to any interference with the succession or with the internal administration, or any infringement of the complete autonomy of the Sheikh.’’ it may be that there are omissions from your reply. 1 am almost led to think so from your language about Koweit to me. You know how desirous I am that the negotiations should succeed ; yet I fail to discover the elements of conciliation, whether in regard to accepting our last proposals as to participation in the railway, or in regard to several other points.

Informal discussion with Turkish delegates has begun. As regards Section 2 of British memorandum of 29th July 1911, they seem to think they can meet us except as to Katr, where withdrawal of military post would he regarded by Turkish Parliament as unjustifiable cession of territory. They ask whether consolidation of Turkish authority there cannot be reconciled with our interest such as suppression of arms traffic, protection of pearl fisheries, and Sheikh of Bahrein’s pasturage rights, and combined with exercise of our maritime supervision where necessary. There seems force in their argument about Parliament, and I should like to know if you think exclusion of Turks from Ivatr is worth sacrifice of an} material parts of our other claims. All the ground has not yet been covered, but if agreement can be reached on all other points, would you accept this compromise provided that Turks bind themselves either to suppiess arms traffic themselves or, failing that, to allow us to do so ? And what conditions would you suggest to secure our interests above mentioned . Please reply as soon as possibleMemorandum communicated to the Turkish, Ambassador, July 29, 1911. (Confidential.) HIS Majesty’s Government Lave not failed to give their careful attention to the important proposals contained in the memorandum of the 1st March last from the Ottoman Government. These proposals, though they affect interests so closely interwoven that they cannot. be settled independently the one of the other, have, for the purpose of convenience, been set forth under three distinct headings :— (i.) The Bagdad Railway question. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. (iii.) An increase from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem in the Turkish customs duties. (i.) The Bagdad Railway Question. On various occasions His Majesty’s Government have indicated the conditions under which they would favour the participation of British capital in this enterprise 5 and, while it is not now proposed to recapitulate the earlier stages of this question, it may be recalled that in duty 1910, as a result of prolonged discussions with the Ottoman Minister of Finance who was then in London, it was intimated that an arrangement securing to British interests a representation of 55 per cent, of the whole in regard to the Gulf sections of the line might be regarded as a satisfactory solution,—and, having regard to the great preponderance of certain interests in other sections of the line, such a proportion cannot well be looked upon as excessive, especially if the great extent of British trade in those regions and the vast tonnage of British shipping are borne in mind. Since the arrangement laid before Djavid Bey represented a large measure of concession on the part of His Majesty’s Government, they have received the suggestions now made by the Ottoman Government with some surprise. The Turkish proposals for the final portions of the railway are that a new company should be formed, and that the capital should be divided between the Ottoman Government, who would receive 40 per cent, of the whole, and British, French, and German groups, who would each receive 20 per cent. The details of the financial arrangements are left for subsequent settlement between the parties interested. His Majesty’s Government regret that they are unable to accept these proposals. If a new company is formed for the construction and working of the railway south of Bagdad, and if it is to be constituted upon an international basis, His Majesty’s Government can only accede to such an arrangement provided that British interests are represented in a degree at least equal to that of any other Power including Turkey, and, in order to effect this and with a view to emphasising the international and commercial character of the undertaking, they would suggest that Russia should be admitted to participation and that the percentage allotted to each country should be 20 per cent. Assuming that this distribution is adopted, His Majesty s Government consider that a Convention should be concluded by the Powers concerned providing foi the exclusion of differential rates on any railways in Asiatic Turkey, and f 01 equality of treatment in regard to transport facilities and cognate matters; foi the alignment of the railway south of Bagdad and the conditions under which it is to be constructed ; for the introduction of approved financial arrangements tending to foster the eve op ment of traffic; and for guaranteeing that the interest in the enterpuse of the severa parties concerned shall be of lasting duration and not subject to termination on le expiry of the Bagdad Railway concession. [2123 f—1]It would furthermore be necessary for the Ottoman Government to undertake formally not to impose river dues on British shipping or cargoes without the assent of His Majesty’s Government. . i x-u i? ^ There remains the question of the terminal port: having regard to the tact that important commercial interests are already established at Bussoiah, His Majesty wt Government cannot but feel that substantial advantages would accrue from the establishment of the terminus at that point 5 and they consider that the poit should be constructed and controlled by the proposed new company in the interests of the unrestricted commerce of all nations. But if such an arrangement is adopted, they must stipulate that, in the event of the railway ever being prolonged to the Persian Gulf, it must be brought to Koweit under conditions to be settled by agreement between Great Britain and Turkey alone, and a clause to this effect must be embodied in a convention dealing with these matters. (ii.) The respective Interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the Region of the Persian Gulf. His Majesty’s Government are willing to meet the wish expressed in the concluding paragraphs of the Turkish memorandum that a precise definition may be reached as to the respective position of the two countries, commercially and politically, in the Persian Gulf; and they see no reason why a lasting settlement of the questions involved should not be reached. His Majesty’s Government are in no sense opposed to the legitimate claims of the Turkish Government. The most southerly point to Avhich they have ever recognised such claims on the littoral of the Persian Gulf is Ojeir, in the district of El Katif. South of this point there is no trace of Turkish power ever having been paramount; in 1870 the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs conveyed to Pier Majesty’s Ambassador formal assurances that the Sublime Porte did not entertain any intention of obtaining supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf ; and it is only since that date that certain attempts have been made by the Ottoman Government to establish mudirates and other emblems of Turkish authority at points to the south of Ojeir. The position of His Majesty’s Government in regard to these tribes has been entirely different. With Bahrein they have had direct relations since 1805 ; these relations have found concrete expression in a series of treaties dating from 1820, and having as their objects the suppression of piracy and the slave trade ; the regularity of the succession to the throne ; the protection of the island against foreign aggression ; and the safety of the pearl industry, of which Bahrein is the centre. In Muscat and the territories of the Trucial Chiefs His Majesty’s Government have, in virtue of various treaties and agreements, conferred similar benefits for many years ; and their policy in each case has been inspired by the importance of upholding the maritime peace, of securing open markets to the commerce of all countries, and of protecting the long-established interests of British-Indian subjects. His Majesty’s Government cannot acquiesce in any arrangement which might restrict or undermine the authority which they have exercised uninterruptedly with such beneficent results ; they conceive that any extension of Turkish jurisdiction along the littoral of the Persian Gulf to the south of Ojeir would be prejudicial to those results and unsupported by any legitimate claims of Turkish sovereignty ; and they have accordingly resisted any attempts which have been made to encroach upon these regions. They are therefore of opinion that any lasting settlement between the two Powers must provide for the definite renunciation by the Ottoman Govern ment of Bahrein and adjacent islands and of the whole of the Peninsula of El Katr (including El Bidaa), where the Sheikh of Bahrein has important rights; and they consider that such a settlement would finally remove a perennial source of local friction. The Ottoman Government express a wish to regularise the relations of Koweit towards the Ottoman Empire, and His Majesty’s Government will gladly contribute to such a solution, on the understanding that their rights and claims are not to be regarded as prejudiced by any proposals which may now be put forward, should such proposals prove abortive. As the Ottoman Government are aware, His Majesty’s Government have never admitted that Koweit is under Turkish protection, and, inasmuch as some divergence of opinion was manifested between the two Governments as to the position there, a modus vivendi was reached in September 1901 by His Majesty’s Government consent ing to give an assurance that, provided the Turkish Government abstained fromsending troops to Koweit and respected tlie status quo there, they would not occupy that place or establish a British protectorate over it. British trade relations with the Sheikhs of Koweit have existed for upwards of two centuries and, inasmuch as the place has attracted merchants from all quarters by the &gt;^^quity of its rule and the freedom of its trade, His Majesty’s Government could not consent to any interference with the succession or with the internal administration, or any infringement of the complete autonomy of the Sheikh. On the other hand, they are prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Koweit, and to recognise the Sheikh as a Turkish Kaimakam, provided in other respects the status quo is guaranteed, and the validity of certain agreements which the Sheikh has concluded with the British Government is recognised ; provided the islands of Warba and Bubian are admitted by Turkey to be within the confines of Koweit, and Turkish military posts are withdrawn ; and provided finally the Sheikh is admitted to the full and undisturbed enjoyment of any properties he may own or hereafter purchase on Turkish territory. Koweit would thus form a sort of enclave within, and forming part of, the Ottoman Empire, but enjoying complete self-government under Turkish suzerainty. Certain difficulties have recently arisen in regard to the buoyage of the Shat-el- Arab. For a great number of years British shipping has, owing to its volume, been predominantly, and until recently almost exclusively, interested in these aids to navigation. For over fifty years the work of surveying, buoying, and lighting the river has been carried out by British agency to the general satisfaction of all concerned. In these circumstances, His Majesty’s Government have some difficulty in appreciating why the Ottoman Government have taken exception to existing and long-standing arrangements ; but, being desirous of dealing with the difficulty in a spirit of conciliation, they would propose to the Ottoman Government the appointment of a small riverain commission, composed of a British and a Turkish representative, with an engineer to be mutually agreed upon. This commission would superintend all matters pertaining to improvement of navigation, and it would likewise superintend the requisite periodical surveys. As regards the rest of the Persian Gulf, on the other hand, the Turkish Govern ment, so far as they are concerned, would recognise the right of Great Britain (a) to control surveying, lighting, buoying, and pilotage; (b) to police its waters; and (c) to conduct all quarantine arrangements. (iii.) The Increase from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem in the Turkish Customs Duties. His Majesty’s Government have consistently maintained that they could in no circumstances assent to the increase in the Turkish customs duties unless a previous and satisfactory settlement had been reached in regard to the Bagdad Railway question. To this attitude they adhere ; and while they consider that such a settlement might be promoted on the lines of an agreement such as has already been indicated, they could not regard a settlement confined to the railway as either satisfactory or complete, since it would leave in a state of uncertainty a number of questions closely affecting British interests in the regions of Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. His Majesty’s Government are in principle favourable to railway construction in Turkey; but they cannot directly contribute to the completion of the Bagdad Railway if it is to introduce a further element of possible disturbance into an aiea where British rights and interests have, especially of late, been wantonly assailed ; nor do they feel that they could justify to British public opinion the imposition of a tax which will affect British trade,—amounting in Mesopotamia to some 60 pei cent, of tie whole,—unless they have provided for a general settlement of political issues m t le Persian Gulf, such as the Ottoman Government themselves desire to bring about, and unless they have obtained some compensation for and a guarantee against the con tinuance of arbitrary acts^such as the demolition, on no adequate pretext, of British the Ottoman Government are prepared to enter upon a negotiation on these lines, and to concur, as already stipulated, in a removal of the ^stmg veto on the borrowing powers of Egypt,—a measure which is called form * e .mterestsof financia! reform in Egypt,—His Majesty’s Government will make it their ^t aim t tribute to an agreement likely to remove all causes o nc ,iPowers ; and they will not only consent, subject to the concurrence of other Powers and to the due observance of such agreement, to the further increase of the Turkish customs for a fixed period, but they will likewise agree to the continued levy of the 3 per cent, customs increase, which had only been sanctioned provisionally till the year 1914. ^ Foreign Office, July 29, 1911.HIS Majesty’s Government have not failed to give their careful attention to the important proposals contained in the memorandum of the 1st March last from the Ottoman Government. These proposals, though they affect interests so closely interwoven that they cannot be settled independently the one of the other, have, for the purpose of convenience, been set forth under three distinct headings :— (i.) The Bagdad Railway question. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. (iii.)

If the Ottoman Government are prepared to enter upon a negotiation on these lines, and to concur, as already stipulated, in a removal of the existing veto on the borrowing powers of Egypt, —a measure which is called for in the interests of financial reform in Egypt,—His Majesty’s Government will make it their first aim to contribute to an agreement likely to remove all causes of friction between the two Powers ; and[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government]^ Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.

Lord Curzon, G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., and Captain Allen T. Hunt, R.N., C.S.I., were also present. VISCOUNT MORLEY : At the preliminary meeting, Sir Edward Grey laid down what he considered to be the three questions before the Committee; those are the questions which I presume we have got to answer, and I think it would be an advantage if he would repeat those before Lord Curzon. SIR EDWARD GREY: The three questions we discussed last time were (1) Did we really wish the Baghdad Railway to stop at Basra, or to be extended to the Persian Gulf; if it was to be prolonged to the Gulf now or at any future time, were we to insist that its terminus must be at Koweit ? (2) Is it essential to the interests of our commerce to obtain legal sanction for our control of the navigation of Shat-al-Arab and its approaches, including the buoyage, lighting, and dredging, also the levying of dues on vessels navigating the river ? (3) What are the utmost limits to the extension of Turkish sovereignty on the Shat-al-Arab, and on the shores of the Gulf which we can agree to ? VISCOUNT MORLEY : Those three points, as the Committee will see, open up a largish number of questions, and I thought it would be a great advantage to the Committee if they could have the knowledge of Lord Curzon, who took a leading part, for example, in the Treaty with the Sheikh of Koweit. He is the only Viceroy, so far as I know, who has ever been in the Persian Gulf, and who is himself as a geographer and a politician well acquainted with the mouth of the Shat-al-Arab and so forth. He would be aware that the situation since he was in the Gulf, which was, I think, in the year 1903, has considerably developed, and it is now a new situation. He recently made an observation which goes to the very root of our enquiries to-day. I will not be [744]guilty of the unfairness of cross-examining him on statements made in debate, but he did lay down what struck me as very important and very interesting, namely, the doctrine that Turkish sovereignty in these regions, which is the point we have before us, was a thing of great importance. He will remember his own language, and I will not put it in mine ; but I think we should be greatly instructed if he would tell us what was the view which found favour with the Government of India when they made that arrangement with the Sheikh of Koweit, and if he would tell us also what is the bearing of that line of argument upon our situation to-day. Perhaps he would tell us to what extent, he would allow Turkish sovereignty to prevail, in what form, and with what limitations. LORD CURZON : Lord Morley, I am very grateful to you for honouring me by giving me the opportunity of attending this Committee, and I need hardly say that if I could render any assistance, which I do not think at all likely, I should be only too proud to do it. I am in some little difficulty, because, of course, I have no cognisance of what has happened officially since I left India. Politics were very active in the Persian Gulf in the time that I was there. I concluded, as you have reminded us, the original agree ment with the Sheikh of Koweit. I visited Koweit, and negotiations, often of a somewhat troublesome character, were going on during nearly the whole time I was in India with the Turkish Government and with the Sheikhs on the shores of the Persian Gulf. I was refreshing my recollection before I came here to-day by looking up my papers, and I found that during the whole time I was pressing a course of action upon His Majesty’s Government, not, I think, really of a dangerous or aggressive or forward description, but anyhow a course of action a little in excess of what they were prepared to adopt. On almost every occasion the desire that I expressed that such and such an assurance should be given, or that such and such a Treaty should he made or repeated, was not regarded with favour at home. I am not criticising the conduct of His Majesty’s Government at all. They have always been, and naturally, I think, very nervous about extending their responsibilities on the coast of the Gulf* particularly because of the opportunities of collision that it offered with the Turkish Government. I have a very distinct recollection of the points as they then existed on each stage of the west shore of the Gulf, but I am afraid that what I might say would be a little bit obsolete now, perhaps wholly obsolete, because I do not know what has happened since. We had a detinite policv in those days for Bahrein, we had a definite policy as regards El Katr, that promontory that sticks out, where the Turks have always been advancing pretensions that we resisted. VISCOUNT MORLEY : You would not allow them to assert any claim south of Ojair, would you ? LORD CURZON : I have always regarded Ojair (Ukeir) as the southern limit of that part of the coast over which they had established, rightly or not, something like definite and incontestable claims. South of that I think we did contest, and successfully contest them. 1 have here the details of what we did in those days about El Katr. If His Majesty’s Government take the line that El Katr is a place over which we neither admit, nor ought to admit, Turkish sovereignty I am satisfied, only the situation is a little bit complicated by the fact that I think they have traces of actual occupation there now as they had then. SIR EDWARD GREY : The Turks have ? LORD CURZON : The Turks. You will remember that in the time Lord Kitchener and I were in India, they tried the experiment of appointing. Turkish officials to three places in El Katr—Zabara, Wakra, and Odeid (Khor-al-Odeid). We protested, and the Turkish Government ultimately withdrew their representatives from there. What has happened since I have no knowledge of, so whether the Turks have improved their position,as against us or not, I do not know. VISCOUNT MORLEY : Though I want to get to the Shat-al-Arab, still as we are down at El Katr I may say it is proposed by some and urged even by some who are in the Gulf at this moment—our Admiral and so on, as Captain Hunt will tell us that we should now definitely assert our complete and undenied control over ther e of th k e “ Te^L^ rhSe SiarChiefe will not at all relish the stiffening of our control and while there milht be a great deal of trouble if we try to assert it, it will not make them turn round to Vurfey, but it will make them very .^XmeTan^l” vou had a Durbar I remember, and you, I am sure, at that time termed an opinion as to whether these Sheikhs, Trucial Chiefs, and so on are really formidable fellows or whither they are very little people indeed who would come in with any claim that we choose to assert over them. TfVRD CTTRZON • That is a different problem because, of course, the Trucial Chiefs are established along that part of the coast south of El Katr. Are you dealing with them ? VISCOUNT MOKLEY: Yes; I wanted to transfer you from El Katr to the Trucial Chiefs to the south. LORD CURZON : Is the suggestion that our hold over the Trucial Chiefs should be strengthened ? VISCOUNT MOBLEY : It is, for what appears to me a very solid reason, namely, that'that brings vou into the pearling banks, and there are many signs that Irene men and Germans are likely to come and try operations on those pearling banks with dredgers and all the new appliances, which will end in the destruction of the value thosf banks by and by. The intrusion of the foreigner for these various purposes is a new question,! thinkf since your time ; and it is thought-it is almost indispensable indeed—that we should assert such a claim as would exclude these excellent people. MR. PARKER : Might I say that the pearl banks are largely outside territorial waters, and the Law Officers in 1902 thought that we could not assert any right of protection over the pearl banks which were outside territorial waters, though we could over those which were in territorial waters, bo our strengthening o ne 10 c over Trucial Chiefs would not alter our control over the pearl banks outside territorial waters. VISCOUNT MORLEY: Not outside the territorial limits, but inside of course it vrmld MR HIRTZEL : Not legally, but possibly in fact it might, because His Majesty s Government decided that they must rely on what we euphemistically called indirect methods for keeping the foreigners out, that meaning that they would arrange with the Trucial Chiefs to put all the difficulties in the way of interlopers that they could. If our hold over them were strengthened, it would be more easy to secure tha . VISCOUNT MORLEY : My point with Lord Curzon is not affected by that. My point was whether in his belief and from his knowledge of the people he a re^sec at Sharga, they would be likely to welcome a tightening of our control over them the object of the tightening being a protection more or less against these foreign dredgers ,and so on. LORD CURZON: The pearl fishery question is a very difficult one. The northern or western limit of the pearl fisheries is north of Bahrein, and they are all outside the promontory of El Katr and around there. The difficulty I hnd in answering your question is this : The Trucial Chiefs extend round a deep indentation in the coast which begins with Oman. In the territory of Oman on the rig it or e east you will see a place called Ras-al-Kheima ; the Trucial Chiefs begin from theie. Then you will see Ajman, Umm-al Kawein, Sharga, Debai (Debei), where the row was a little time ago ; they extend all round that bay there up to El Katr, the promontory over which the Turks make claims. Bahrein is round the corner, of course, more to the west. These Arab Sheikhs have their interest in the pearl fishery lying off the coast but I do not quite understand how strengthening our hold over these Chiefs here wi put us or them in a better position as regards the pearl banks. When you ta o strengthening our hold, what do you mean?1 ^ The je ^ id i' 1 tatioD )r tlie there. ffas a jr over ;0 coast'» e alk uf \ ISCOUNT MORLEY; That is the opinion sent to us by Admiral Slade for example, and I think Captain Hunt, who has just come from the Gulf, would say the same thing, would you not ? CAPTAIN HUNT : I think that all these Chiefs here are absolutely uncivilised, and the whole of the Trucial Coast is an open sore. It seems to me that it is time that something definite should be settled as to who runs the coast and who has all the responsibility for it. At the present moment the other Powers do not accept our rights along that Trucial Coast. SIR EDWARD GREY : The immediate question that we have got to decide is, 1 think, what we have to say to Turkey d propos of these negotiations. I assume we should have to get Turkey, before we give consent to English customs dues, to define her limits in the Persian Gulf in such a way as to exclude from her sovereignty the Trucial Chiefs. LORD CURZON : She has never made any claims over the Trucial Chiefs. SIR EDWARD GREY: I do not say that she has done that yet, but she has been pushing forward lately down towards El Katr, Zakhnuniyah, and so forth. What we rather want to do is to get her once and for all to put her hand to limits of sovereignty on her part in the region of the Persian Gulf, which will exclude from her sovereignty places in which we are particularly interested. We want really to know how much we can give her. I do not think it is necessary to press her to recognise us outside those limits, provided she defines limits beyond which she will not attempt to assert or take sovereignty. That leaves us free to decide. One of the places we are quite clear about is Bahrein, which we must have a protectorate over. Whatever limits Turkey assigns must be subject to excluding Bahrein from her jurisdiction. We rather want to decide what limit to the south is the extreme limit which we can concede to her. SIR WILLIAM NICHOLSON : Does not Turkey claim the whole of the hinter land in this part ? SIR EDWARD GREY : Turkey will claim anything that she is not prevented from claiming. SIR WILLIAM NICHOLSON : Has she not made a claim to the hinterland ? SIR EDWARD GREY : I imagine she has. SIR WILLIAM NICHOLSON : Then I presume we shall have to decide how far the littoral extends. It will not do to say to her, “ You cannot go there,” if the whole of this hinterland belongs to her. SIR EDWARD GREY : The real question is where she stops on the coast. The critical point for the moment is whether we could possibly concede her sovereignty over El Katr, or whether we must at all costs say that she stops at Ojair (Ukeir), which excludes El Katr. Bahrein we are quite clear about; she must not meddle with that. VISCOUNT MORLEY : Unquestionably. LORD CURZON : Can anybody here tell me whether Sheikh Bin Ahmed is alive ? MR PARKER : No ; he is dead now. I am nearly certain.* LORD CURZON : Who is the ruling Sheikh over El Katr now ? MR. PARKER : Ahmed’s successor is considered, so I gather from recent corre spondence, to be rather favourable to Turkey. LORD CURZON : I agree with what Sir Edward Grey has said, and I think it is very important. The point is to fix a southern limit to Turkish territory. Turkish * He was murdered at the end of 1905. [7 it;+ v ;il parry with it the hinterland, but we need not bother about sovereignty on the coast viUcy dowQ to 0 . air (Ukeir)i obviously that that, because if we say we conceae nei includes the hinterland. SIB EDWABD GBEY : Obviously we can never go in there. The coast is w at i US# t OPT) PTTB70N ' Putting aside the question whether we ought to strengthen our LOBD / ; ite ^ different matter, we ought to establish our hold over the Trucial Chieis, ; n The „ reat difficulty about El Katr is, as you claim to everything south f. i“ e | ahrein bein / in an indentation of the will see from the map that it hems ^ Bahrein, Bahrein ^ pirates at E1 K atr. ^he^action^aken^by'ourseU'es Tn 1903 and 1904 as regards El Katr was very strong indeed. VISCOUNT MOBLEY : What did you say about El Katr to Turkey ? T (TRD CUBZON • What happened then was this : In 1903 the Turkish Govern- Beg to Wakra. W 'lfl a n^ Abdurman (who language—on his withdra' . , Y Sheikh on that coast) Mudir. Thereupon XZtStrGXZZ -y b s 'i “5,”£ •££%*£ S—. (S “««-j “ir F '“i' E1 K ‘V;Eh “?,■ SS-Sfe o durances of friendship. It was thought likely he would turn up at Bahrein when was there to see me, but he did not come. I again suggested an agreemen m ai 1904 or if His Maiesty’s Government did not agree to that, that we should morm that the Treaty of 1868 which was concluded with his father shouM be^ e d bmdm upon him. His Majesty’s Government were not anxious, as they thought, to enna their responsibilities in the country and they refused. T ur kbh Therefore, when I left India we had so fax succeeded m combating the jurk^^ claims that they had withdrawn the Mudirs they had appointed an p i ^ ^ should make the position more secure for ouiselves by entering into s agreement with the then reigning Chief, but His Majesty s Governmen their way to do it. That was the situation then ; whether it has changed since not know. VISCOUNT MOBLEY: I find that in December 1902 the predecessor ot WTlcox and Butcher wrote to the Government of India thus ^ oT protection, necessary purposes the Trucial Chiefs maybe considered o e unc i e^ all( q im til and there is no necessity to make this protectorate more favourable unless “d '^ future developments in the Gulf make that inevitable. L he question is then w any of those future developments make the formal declaration of a protectorate and so on more advisable than it was in 1902. LORD CURZON : The Trucial Chiefs do not come into this scheme that you are discussing now ; they stop short of it. VISCOUNT MOBLEY : They do not come up to Bahrein, I know. LORD CUBZON : Ahmed was not a Trucial Chief. I was not quite satisfied w ith the position as regards the Trucial Chiefs, because in one respect the a Sp»“® n ® relation for the most part to piracies at sea, and the question ^/^W^ocItP supposing a row took place on land, and supposing they were guilty of some atrocity or raised some difficulty about the customs, what could we do upon land . Did oiTreaty give us the right to interfere upon land ? That difficulty was constantly arising, and 1 believe that in some cases we did act on land. The question of what to do with the Trucial Chiefs is, is it not, quite a different one from the point raised by Sir Edward Grey, which is, what is the southern limit to fix with the Turkish Government ? SIR EDWARD GREY : Of course ; if the Turks stop at Ojair (Ukeir), the Trucial Chiefs do not come in. LORD CURZON : And the question therefore of whether you strengthen your hold over them is quite an independent one. VISCOUNT MORLEY : Yes ; but if you are taking a comprehensive view— which is a thing to distrust, I admit, but still if you are—of the affairs of the Persian Gulf, and if you realise that there is something very like a crisis actual or approaching in the Gulf, you have got to look at the whole, detail after detail. Bahrein, of course, and also the Trucial Chieis—first beginning with them. LORD CURZON : Are our relations with the Trucial Chiefs disturbed now? VISCOUNT MORLEY : Captain Hunt, you were at Debai (Debei). What have you got to tell us ? Do not tell us the facts, because we know those. CAPTAIN HUNT: There was a purely local disturbance. They are very fanatical. Men were landed before daylight, and so on ; and of course they were up in arms at once, and started firing. The Chief is a very small man, and has no power over the country ; whereas the other people are bigger men. He is the smallest man on the coast. The point about El-Katr is that the Turks still have 100 men at Wakra. They landed 400 originally, and we protested, and they have taken away 300 of them for other purposes up the Gulf. MR. PARKER : Ever since 1872 they have had a post at El Bidaa, and we have allowed it to remain there, but we have never recognised their claim to El Katr. CAPTAIN HUNT : They still have 100 men there. VISCOUNT MORLEY : Lord Curzon, to leave that part of the matter, though it is extremely important, what is actual at the moment is about Basra and Koweit. Admiral Slade thinks that bringing it to Basra will .be. a much better way of doing things when the Baghdad Railway is made than bringing it to Koweit ; then this question arises as to the navigation rights in the Shat-al-Arab. As you know, the Persians have one bank and the Turks have another; we do all the duties of a riparian Power, but we are not a riparian Power—we have no power at all legally and technically. It is for the seamen, beginning with Admiral Slade, to tell us about the navigability of the Bar and up to within 6 or 7 miles of Basra on the Shat-al- Arab, and to on. I do not know if that point came within your view at all in your day. LORD CURZON : Yes ; I think we went very carefully into the whole question of the Baghdad Railway and its possible terminus at Koweit. As. you know, I went up and saw Khor Abdulla and went round Bubian Island. I think I advised His Majesty’s Government on the matter, and I certainly hold very strong views about it. SIR EDWARD GREY : We should like to know what your views are, because it is all in question now. LORD CURZON : Something depends, of course, upon the position taken up by His Majesty’s Government with regard to Koweit. Of course, you know the whole history much better than I do. The Sheikh of Koweit had been philandering with the Turkish Government for years, and during the time that 1 was in India he was being attacked from a two-fold quarter. First, the Turks themselves kept sending down in order to try to induce him to accept the Turkish flag, or to accept a Turkish garrison, or to accept a Turkish postal official, or something of that sort. On the other hand, there was perpetual trouble arising from the internecine conflicts of Ibn Rashid and the other man Ibn Saud, who were two men who were fighting for the control of the interiorII of the country Ibn Saud was a relation of the Sheikh Abdulla, and was living with 01 me counui.y ^ as hid his rival, was acting under the name and encouragement “ Tu7k The TurkTkept sending him down to attack Koweit. When matters became critical His Majesty’s Government authorised the Government of India to resist became cut , J We sent a man-of-war, we landed troops, we tZewup fortiiications, and we were prepared to defend it. Therefore at that time we werT b ddly contesting the claim of Turkey to exercise zny de facto interference with Koweit or 7 to strengthen their nominal claim of sovereignty there. Then Abdulla, frightened bv all those -operations, turned to us, and m my day he was certainly mod anx ous that he should come under our protectorate. ^ One of the first things that I was called upon to do was to complete the first Treaty with him in 1899, and when I went ?o the Gulf in 1902, he was overjoyed at the recognition of his position, which was hereby implied, and I remember when I gave him a sword he said, “Why have you not given me a belt, in order that I may ^put on the sword and make myself the perpetual servant of the British Government ” ? , P P His Maiesty’s Government did not favour the protectorate, but they did agree so far as you will remember, as to establish, first a native official there m charge of the post office, secondly, a British officer, named Captain Knox, who went there for a few months in the year, and thirdlv, a permanent British officer at Koweit. Meanwhile, mv recollection is that discussions were going on at Constantinople, and that both parties without mitigating in either case their claim said, very well, what we will agree to do is to maintain the status quo. SIR EDWARD GREY: What the Turks were told at the time—I have looked back at it—was that we should not claim a protectorate over Koweit so long as the status quo was not disturbed. LORD CUUZON : And that has been the situation ever since ? SIR EDWARD GREY: Yes, and the situation has been less acute. I think in the last few years the only acute question has been about dates, has it not ? MR. PARKER: Yes, about the Sheikh’s date groves which are on Turkish territory. SIR EDWARD GREY : Wo have not had to cut in and defend him, but the difficulty is that the Turks pinch him over the revenue from his date plantation which is in their territory. He flies the Turkish flag and has accepted the tide of Kaimxkam. LORD CURZON : Is that so ? For years he has been a KaTmakam—ever since he has been on the throne. Does he fly the Turkish flag now ? SIR EDWARD GREY : He has done so for years. My recollection is that he has flown the Turkish 11 &gt;g for a long time, and when he is asked about it he says it is the Mussulman fl ig. VISCOUNT KI ICHENER: It is considered as such. It is never considered as the Turkish flag, SIR EDWARD GREY: But it is, as a matter of fact, the Turkish flag that he flies. VISCOUNT KITCHENER: They some rimes put little variations on it. The Sultan of Muskat and the Sultan of Zanzibar both fly the Mussulman flag. LORD CURZON : The flag carried in front of him was a flag with a red ground, on which was written in large, white, Arabic characters “ Trust in God, whic was a somewhat non-committal proceeding. We advised him to fly his own flag. MR. HIRTZEL: That point has never been settled ; it remains exactly as it was. There was a suggestion that he should fly a flag, the lurkish one, witi owe! written across it in Arabic letters, but he demurred to that because he t loug i 'P 11 get him into trouble with the Turks. The question was dropped, and it has remaine in that position ever since. LORD OURZON : I have a note that in July 1905, the Sheikh of Koweit was advised by the British Government to have a distinctive flag, the Im is ag wi9 words in Arabic across it, and that that would require a special form of certificate. That was not done, was it ? ME. HIETZEL : Later in the same year he demurred on the ground that it was sure to get him into trouble with the Turks unless he was guaranteed by us against the consequences, and that guarantee was not given. SIE EDWAEX) GREY: We want to get a settlement with the Turks about it, and the question is whether the Turks, supposing their suzerainty was recognised over Koweit, would in turn be prepared to guarantee the status quo, that is, the autonomy of the Sheikh, and to accept the treaties which we have made with him as being part of the status quo, the object of our treaties being that they should not take in any of his territory. LORD CURZON : Have you not concluded another Treaty since 1899 with him ? SIR EDWARD GREY : Yes ; we have got a lease of land. LORD CURZON : I have never seen that. What does it say ? MR. PARKER : We have got a lease of certain land on the foreshore of Koweit, and the right of pre-emption in regard to land on Koweit territory—including Bubian and Warba. SIR EDWARD GREY : All that would come into the status quo ; that is what we want to get Turkey to recognise as part of the status quo. MR. PARKER : Also in that agreement it says he must never receive any foreign agent or any agent of the Turkish Government. SIR H. LLEWELLYN SMITH : Is that part of the status quo ? MR. PARKER : That is what we consider part of the status quo, but it might be difficult to get the Turks to recognise it. LORD CURZON : Is the question at issue now whether the railway is taken to Koweit or not ? SIR EDWARD GREY : The Turks have made certain proposals to us about the Baghdad Railway, and we have to make counter-proposals. The question is whether we should say to them that we think it would be much better in regard to the southern section that we should put in a proviso, to which we should want them to agree, that if at any future date the railway is carried beyond Basra to the Persian Gulf it should come out at Koweit. MR. PARKER: Before that is discussed would it not be well to tell Lord Curzon that according to a recent report of Admiral Slade the bar of the Shat-al-Arab has deepened very much, and that that removes the principal objection to making Basra the terminus ? SIR EDWARD GREY : What Admiral Slade s report amounts to is that it would be far cheaper and just as effective for the purposes of the railway to make Basra the port as to make Koweit the port. MR. PARKER : Owing to the change in the bar. SIR EDWARD GREY : If that is so, it is merely a waste of money to bring it to Koweit. Also, what points in the same direction is that, if we do insist on the railway coming to Koweit, there is all the difficulty about the Sheikh’s autonomy, because you cannot leave the terminus of a big railway like the Baghdad Railway and its port purelv under the control of the Sheikh ; you would have to have arrangements about policing it, and who is to have charge of it, and so forth ; and so you would be really bringing the Turks into Koweit. LORD CURZON : I think all that is very important. If you can carry the railway to Basra, which, of course, is exclusively in Turkish territory, and get it to stop there I think that is gain No. 1. If you can then acquire control lor ourselves ovei ’ [04] D I !i! &lt;r~ f K tbe channel from Basim Tt'lnj under our control, that wou e ano should remain untouched, in other words, autonomous Sheikh or chief in Turkish territory, that would be another gain. SIR EDWARD GREY : Recognising Turkish suzerainty, because of course we should have to do that ? LORD CURZON : Yes, but Koweit would be a sort of enclave, would it not ? SIR EDWARD GREY : Yes. LORD CURZON: And they would not be allowed if yon recognised their suzerainty, to pounce down upon the Sheikh or to send troops own . SIR EDWARD GREY : That would be a disturbance of the status quo. It seems bin- nao vv axvl/ vrx an -nv, it would be an intolerable quite clear, after all that has passed with the Sheikh, that ^ wu Sheikh &gt; s Shock to our prestige if, as the result of any agreement with turkey, position was not recognised. LORD CURZON : I quite agree with that. SIR EDWARD GREY: But if by conceding Turkish suzerainty we can get his status quo recognised by the Turks, his position is more secure than it was. LORD CURZON : What about a British officer remaining there ? SIR EDWARD GREY : I think we should have to have a British officer, a consul, or something of that kind. LORD CURZON : Is lufthere now? SIR EDWARD GREY: Yes. LORD CURZON : Is he a naval officer, or a political officer ? MR. HIRTZEL: He is a political officer. LORD CURZON : Do you remember his name ? MR. HIRTZEL : Shakespeare. SIR EDWARD GREY: I think we should have to call him a consul instead of a Resident. LORD CURZON : But it is very important that you should keep him there. SIR EDWARD GREY : Yes ; we should keep him there as consul. LORD CURZON : The question of that Koweit territory raises the whole question of Bubian, which is a very difficult question as you know. We fought it hard X do not know whether Lord Kitchener was there. VISCOUNT KITCHENER: I think I do remember it. LORD CURZON: The Turks had established themselves in a posmon to the north of Bubian at Urn Kasr, and they had an eye upon Khor Abdulla We had to concede that, because we had not protested against it but we did protest a g al ' st * posts in the southern parts of Bubian, except one. You would have to include those if you could in the territories of the Sheikh of Koweit ? VISCOUNT KITCHENER : I think so, undoubtedly. MR. PARKER: The difficulty is to deline how far inland the Turkish territory LORD CURZON : That is very difficult, because it is all open desert of course.SIR EDWARD GREY : We need not be very keen about getting much inland. . YISCOUNT KITCHENER : Has it ever been considered that the irrigation works which are taking place here will interfere with the navigation ? Does Admiral Slade’s Report on the Shat-al-Arab deal with that ? SIR EDWARD GREY : Would the irrigation works affect the navigation below Basra ? * + ™ U Nr KIICHENER : I have been asking whether that had been examined into; I do not know whether they would or would not. I doubt whether it would ^ ^ ver y much. I was. only asking whether it has ever been examined into by Wiicocks, or whether any opinion has been got from him. SIR ARTHUR WILSON : There was a report from Wiicocks only a few days ago, but I do not think he can have known very much about it. ■ . . EDWARD GREF : We have always acted on the assumption that the irrigation would not affect the navigation below Basra, but that it would very much afreet it between Basra and Baghdad. VISCOUNT KITCHENER: I should think it is a question that Wiicocks might give us an important opinion upon. . VISCOUNT MORLEY : Lord Curzon, to go back to your point about the desirableness of keeping the whole of that region with all the ensigns of sovereignty and so on, how does that affect it ? LORD CURZON : My point was always this—that Turkish sovereignty along the Shat-al-Arab and down there is of course rather precarious, and is constantly disputed by the Arab tribes; but, at the same time, we have never contested that it was Turkish territory, and I thought myself that no possible harm can result to us, and that advantage may accrue to the Turkish Government, from our recognition of that fact. I would recognise Turkish sovereignty over the whole of the territory there if the recognition was required, right away down to the disputed territory of Koweit. VISCOUNT MORLEY : You have stated that, feeling that it is more essential for our interests that there should be a decently strong Turkish Government in those regions ? O LORD CURZON : Yes. SIR EDWARD GREY: But you do not want the Turks to be in such a position that they could block the navigation of the Shat-al-Arab, so as to shut off all communi cation at Mohammerah (Muhamrah). LORD CURZON : I want them to be stopped at Basra, and I have always wanted that. * SIR EDWARD GREY : You said the control of the Shat-al-Arab was within their sovereignty LORD CURZON : I did not say the Shat-al-Arab, but the control of the river down to Basra. The Shat-al-Arab is Persian on the left bank. For every reason I think it is most important to end the railway at Basra, and not to bring it down further. Once you bring it south of Basra, you have an enormous sphere of complicated interests arising. If you bring it down the Shat-al-Arab you will have the Sheikh of Mohammerah (Muhamrah), and if you take it down to Koweit you will have all these questions about the disputed claims. You will have all the difficulties arising of making your harbour at Koweit, and you will have an international question arising : What is to be the status of this man ? What about the Customs ? Who is to manage the port ? Then you will have the fact, which I have always attached great importance to, that you will have a port in the Persian Gulf as the terminus of a railway which is not a British railway, but which is under the influence of a foreign Power if not under foreign sovereignty. The longer you keep that off the better. If you can have your terminus at Basra, if I may be allowed to give an opinion, I shouldf 5 12 „„ , „ ;t ns .tronp-lv as YOU can, holding over the rest, reserving your rights, S insisting^tha^nothfng “/be done’ in the Future without your consent. VISCOUNT MORLEY : You are entirely averse to anything like the Danube Commission ? T fYRn PTTRZON : I have no experience of the Danube Commission; but inter national commissions are very dubious things, I think. SIR EDWARD GREY : Supposing it stopped at Basra, we have then got the point of the navigation of the Shat-al-Arab, which, of course, becomes very important. LORD CURZON : What are the proposals about that ? SIR EDWARD GREY : There is great difficulty in defining I urkish territory there because in 1850 we unfortunately gave the Turks a map which gives them both banks of the Shat-al-Arab. The Turks have not quoted that map to us yet, but they may bring it up at any time. SIR H. LLEWELLYN SMITH : I think they never accepted it. SIR EDWARD GREY: They happily did not accept it. SIR H. LLEWELLYN SMITH : So we are all right. SIR EDWARD GREY : That will not prevent them bringing it up. LORD CURZON : Did we concede everything on this side of the red line ? VISCOUNT KITCHENER : The red line is drawn on the left bank of the Shat- al-Arab. SIR EDWARD GREY : So as to give them the whole of the Shat-al-Arab. LORD CURZON : Have they ever used this, and brought it up against you ? SIR EDWARD GREY : No, they have not yet, but, of course, we are only at the beginning ol the negotiations. MR. PARKER: We know they have got it now, from a statement that appeared in the Baghdad papers. SIR H. LLEWELLYN SMITH : They possess it physically, but they have never agreed to it, and they did not accept it. SIR EDWARD GREY : But they have not torn it up. SIR H. LLEWELLYN SMITH: I should have thought a sixty years’old map, which was not accepted, was not of much use to them. MR. HIRTZEL : Moreover, in 1869, we presented quite another map with no line at all, and that has governed the situation ever since. LORD CURZON: What would be your claim as regards the Shat-al-Arab? What would be your alternative to an International Commission, like the Lanu e . Would it be British control, or British-Turkish control ? SIR EDWARD GREY : I do not see how you can get exclusive British control, because obviously the Turks have one bank at any rate. LORD CURZON : Could you get the joint control of Great Britain and Turkey ? VISCOUNT MORLEY : There is Persia : you must put Persia in. LORD CURZON: Persian authority there is rather dubious. I do not know exactly what is the status of the Sheikh of Mohammerah (Muhamrah). e is a ersia colonel, but then most of these fellows are Turkish or Persian colonels. SIR EDWARD GREY : Our Treaty with the Sheikh of Mohammerah (Muhamrah) is that we are to protect him against aggression, so long as he recognises is o gto the Persian Government as he is under their suzerainty. We have recognised him as being part of Persia. LORD pURZON : His territory begins some distance below Basra : I forget the place where it stops ; I think it is Felahieh. MR. PARK it R : There was a fort there, which was demolished, and there is still a castle, his residence. VISCOUNT MORLEY : Did you go to Mohammerah (Muhamrah) ? LORD CURZON: Yes, and I was there in the old days. 1 have a good deal of experience of the place. VISCOUNT KIICHENER : I think the line ought to have beeen drawn in the middle of the river instead of beyond the bank. That was a mistake of the draughtsman no doubt, sixty years’ ago. Mfl. PARKER: It says in the Report which accompanied the map that it went along the coast, and the Commissioners Report said that it was to go along the coast and not in the centre. SIR EDWARD GREY : It would be preferable, if we can, to get an arrangement with the Turks. Any arrangement with the Turks, for the navigation will include an arrangement for lighting, buoying, and so forth. All that entails shipping dues, and the question is whether we can levy shipping dues on German ships, which will decline to pay the dues unless there is some Commission on which they are represented. LORD CURZON : How do the Germans come into this question ? SIR EDWARD GREY : It is a mere question of shipping. They do not come in at all as regards the railway except in this sense, that it is under the stipulation that the Turks have made with them to give them a share in the railway at least as great as what is given to any other foreign Power. The navigation is quite distinct from the railway. German shipping goes into the Persian Gulf and will go to Basra, and if you want to levy dues the question will arise directly you attempt to make the German shipping pay dues. If the Turks do it of themselves, of course as long as they are a sovereign Power they are entitled to levy dues for everything which is done in their own territorial waters. The difficulty is for us to get into it. One possible thing is that we should get in as the delegate of Persia ; but you will never get the Persians to put their hands to anything which delegates their sovereign rights to us. Then you might do it through the Sheikh of Mohammerah (Muhamrah) without saying anything to the Persian Government. LORD CURZON : The object of the Commission of 1850 was to secure freedom of navigation to Mohammerah (Muhamrah) as well as to Basra. Cannot we maintain our buoys ? That object will be defeated if we do not. SIR EDWARD GREY : I think we can do that, but we shall not be able to make foreign shipping pay dues. LORD CURZON : That is absolutely necessary in regard to our buoys. SIR ARTHUR WILSON : It is not a question of the buoys ; it is a question of keeping the channel op^n. If the railway comes to Basra, the trade will increase immensely, and you must have expenditure in order to keep the channel clear. To do that you must levy the dues on the ships that come. LORD CURZON : Where would you levy the dues ? SIR ARTHUR WILSON : Either at Busra or at Mohammerah (Muhamrah). They ought to be levied at a port; that is the way it is done. LORD CURZON : Where are they paid now ? SIR ARTHUR WILSON : I do not think they are paid at all. I think there are no dues ; practically the British India Line has maintained the buoys up till now. [744] EJ 14 LORD CURZON : Will not dues in future be required to pay the expense of dredging ? qtt&gt; APTTTTTR WILSON • There is sure to be some expense to keep that channel where H is ™ channel has hnproved itself, but there is no reason why that channel should remain permanent; anyhow, if there is to be continuous traffic, it will require annual surveys to see that it Is not altering, and probably some engineering operations to prevent changes taking place and so on. There must be some expense entailed. SIR EDWARD GREY : With the port at Basra there is sure to be expense. SIR ARTHUR WILSON : And it may be a large expense. SIR EDWARD GREY: It may be a large expense for keeping the navigation open and in proper condition. SIR ARTHUR WILSON : The expense at the mouth of the river must increase too, and that must be raised by dues. LORD CURZON : Is there a very strong feeling entertained against a Joint Commission ? SIR EDWARD GREY: It gives a footing to the Germans, for instance, in the Persian Gulf, obviously, if there is a Commission on which they are represented ; and it gives a footing to other people. VISCOUNT MORLEY : Unless it is limited, as I think Admiral Slade suggests, to Turkey, Persia, and Great Britain. SIR EDWARD GREY : But then we should not be able to levy dues on foreign ships, or at least on German ships. SIR ARTHUR WILSON : The Turks and Persians could, either one or the other. SIR EDWARD GREY: They could do it, but Great Britain should have some control. SIR ARTHUR WILSON : We want an agreement with Turkey and Persia that we shall have a joint Committee to control the expenditure. SIR EDWARD GREY : Our difficulty is to get some control over this, and yet to make other people pay without their having any share of the control. It is very difficult to make those two ends meet. SIR WILLIAM NICHOLSON : Would it do any harm if Germany got into the Gulf? What would be the diplomatic effect of Germany gaining a footing m the Gulf? SIR EDWARD GREY : Or being on a Commission like this that we are talking of? VISCOUNT MORLEY : There is the language, which was approved by Lord Curzon at all events, used by Sir Charles Dilke, who said we ought to have m the Cult not only paramount but monopoly interest. LORD CURZON : Politically. VISCOUNT MORLEY : We have had it of course, and it will be a great pity it we lose it. But if we are going to maintain it, which perhaps is the right view, then, of course, Germany is out of it. VISCOUNT KITCHENER: I do not see how Germany can resist the claim of Turkey and Persia combined, to demand dues in their own territory and their own waters. SIR EDWARD GREY : I do not think she would ; but if we are represented on the control of the navigation she would claim to be represented too. She would say she would not pay dues to a Commission on which we were represented unless she also hadsome representation. If it were a Commission confined to the two Powers on the bhat-al-Arab, she would have no claim; but she would say that she had as much rmht as a third Power. &amp; LOUD CURZON : That claim could be made by any foreign Power sending ships up the Gulf. &amp; r 1 SIR EDWARD GREY : Few other Powers send enough ships to be of any importance. One or two ships a year do not entitle a Power to representation. LORI) CURZON : You will remember that a few years ago Russia made a bold attempt and France made a bold attempt to start commerce there, and they subsidised the ships which went out. SIR EDAYARD GREY: You would have to bring other Powers in ; but if Germany is to come in, I do not see any objection to the others. LORD CURZON : Then you get an International Commission? SIR EDWARD GREY: Yes. SIR H. LLEWELLYN SMITH: Supposing that the result of the railway negotiations was that we were properly represented on the southern section of the railway, would there be any objection to its being part of the concession to the company that they should keep the navigation to the terminal port open ? Then the Turks could levy dues, and there would be merely a financial arrangement with the company. SIR EDWARD GREY : The Turks paying the dues over? SIR LLEWELLYN SMITH : They would be controlled by the general financial arrangement between the concessionnaire and the Turkish Government. Of course it would not suit us if we did not get proper representation. LORD CURZON : When you talk about the terminal port, are you now speaking of Basra ? SIR H. LLEWELLYN SMITH : Assuming that the railway ceases at Basra, one of the obligations on the company which constructs the southern section might be to do the necessary dredging. SIR ARTHUR WILSON : So far, Germany claims equal rights on the railway. SIR H. LLEWELLYN SMITH : But the dues would then be levied by the Turkish Government. VISCOUNT KITCHENER : Will it be Great Britain that will construct the southern section ? SIR EDWARD GREY: We shall have a share in it. VISCOUNT KITCHENER : But only a share ? SIR EDWARD GREY : Yes. You would never get the Turks to concede the whole of it ; and the Germans have stipulated that they should have an equal share to ours. LORD CURZON : Why should you not, as regards the river below Basra, if you are to have a Commission, give a share—I only throw this out as an idea—to any European Power proportionate to its commerce ? SIR EDWARD GREY : That comes to an International Commission. LORD CURZON : International in this sense that, in addition to Turkey, Persia, and ourselves, there would be Germany; for the time being there would be nobody else. Nobody else would come in except in relation to their commerce. SIR EDWARD GREY : In relation to their shipping ? LORD CLTRZON : Yes ; and you may fix the representation in relation to a certain tonnage of shipping going up and down in the year.I J H 16 CUE FDWAllD GKEY • If we are to have a Commission at all, I do not see any objection to admitting other Powers, because the more Powers who come into it and are represented on the cfmmission, the less is the special position conceded to anyone. VISCOUNT MORLEY * Does that not affect the prestige argument Lord Kitchener and other people have urged? I am the least of a prestige man in the world but I have always thought there was something m it. You will no doub completely alter your status in the minds of Indian friends and others if you are not any longer monopolists and paramount. It may be necessary, but that is another thing. VISCOUNT KITCHENER: I do not see any other way out of it. SIR EDWARD GREY : There is to be a great expansion of commerce going up to a well-equipped and constructed port of Basra if the communication is kept open It is almost impossible to maintain monopoly of control if you have got no territorial rights. VISCOUNT KITCHENER: Of course we should have the vast majority of the trade. SIR WILLIAM NICHOLSON : The Germans tried to get a great deal of it, but they failed. VISCOUNT KITCHENER : We should always have that; we should always see 90 per cent, of the trade coming in British bottoms. SIR EDWARD GREY : It could be met by claiming representation according to the tonnage of shipping. SIR WILLIAM NICHOLSON : When I was in India, I was in the north of India, where of course they know very little about the Persian Gulf. In Bombay, and certainly about Karachi, they take an interest in it, but in the north of India, in Calcutta, and in the south of India, they have never heard of the Persian Gulf. VISCOUNT KITCHENER : And you never heard of Italy there. SIR WILLIAM NICHOLSON: That is so : I mean to say that they do not know who is in the Persian Gulf, though they may hear that pearls come from the Peisian Gulf. The trade is very small—only about 3 millions counting both ways, and I think most of it is in the hands of a few Parsis in Bombay. Beyond the Parsis in Bombay and a few people perhaps in the Deccan, I do not believe if you were to go into the north of India, the Punjab, or the north-west Provinces, you would find they know any thing about the Gulf. VISCOUNT KITCHENER : Indeed they do, for they go to Mecca and Medina on their pilgrimages. STB WILLIAM NICHOLSON : They go by sea to Mecca or Medina; they do not go through the Persian Gulf. SIR EDWARD GREY : I cannot say that the Commission would be necessarily fatal to our prestige if it is limited to this particular question of keeping the navigation open. LORD CURZON : I think I can reply to Sir William Nicholson’s argument in two sentences. The first is, as you know, that many people will give it as their opinion that they do not care twopence about the Shah ; therefore, I am not the least impressed by what you tell me about Calcutta not being impressed with the Persian Gulf. The second point is the real value of your prestige. When you get to the Persian Gulf itself you see that it is all-important to us and very directly affects us, and that we should maintain our position. I need not go into the whole question of what it means if we do not maintain our position, even if we have to increase our expenditure and increase our naval force and a hundred different things. I d .0 not think I need pursue all that. Really, the importance of keepuig our position in the Persian Gulf is very great. The point before the Committee is a grave point, whether that position would be impaired by an International Riverine Commission, sitting, I imagine, at Basra, in order to control the river between Basra and Eao, with representatives of the different Powers upon it in proportion to the tonnage of their shipping going up there.17 * VISCOUNT MORLEY : Our tonnage being 85 per cent, of the total. LORD CURZON : I should not like straightway to say that our prestige must be impaired by such an arrangement, which I think is well worthy of consideration. VISCOUNT KITCHENER: It would have to be kept entirely on commercial lines, and should not be political. LORD CURZON : Of course. SIR ARTHUR WILSON : Would it not be feasible to get into agreement with the Turks as soon as possible now, because there will be no expenditure to speak of until the trade really does develop, and that will be very many years yet. If we once get an agreement with the Turks, we could set to work taking an annual survey and keeping up the buoys, and doing all that small work which does not require the levying of fees at all, or if there were any they would be extremely small. When that is once in working order, the other question and the bigger question of levying large fees and having a Commission to settle it would only arise much later, when we had been steadily doing it for a long time, and probably it would not be objected to in the same way then, as we should have a sort of vested right. SIR EDWARD GREY : You mean that we should leave that to the last ? SIR ARTHUR WILSON : Agree with the Turks as soon as possible as to having a small Commission, with an engineer appointed mutually to look after the river and make the annual surveys, and so on, the expense of which might very well be borne by the two Governments as far as that goes. The expenditure would be extremely small. That would go on until the railway is actually made, and until the trade increases. Then when we are actually in possession it is much easier to let the thing simply go on as it is, and it is not likely to raise any points of dispute. VISCOUNT ESHER : What about Persia ? SIR ARTHUR WILSON : We could look after Persia’s interests. We have got to ensure Persia the right to the navigation to Mohammerah (Muhamrah), and it is hardly necessary that she should come and do it. SIR EDWARD GREY : We should never get from Persia at the present moment delegated authority to look after her interests. They would make such a lot of fuss about it. The Persians are not at all in a position to put their hand to anything at the present moment, and they would not put their hand to that. SIR ARTHUR WILSON : All we should do would be to say it is the duty of our Representative to see that the navigation up to Mohammerah (Muhamrah) is kept open. SIR EDWARD GREY : I think our strongest ground in going to the Turks would be what we have done about buoying and lighting all the way up the Shat-al-Arab now, and the proportion of our shipping. SIR ARTHUR WILSON : The enormous proportion of our shipping. LORD CURZON : I think Admiral Wilson’s suggestion is a very important and very useful one—I mean to keep the status quo as long you can ; and so long as the status quo involves the Turks not being asked to pay, you know how willing they will be to adopt that. Then later, if commerce develops and it is necessary, and it the railway gets to Basra, have your International Commission to consider it then, but do not propose it now ? SIR ARTHUR WILSON : Make your annual surveys and. so on now, and put their official on it and let them have a voice in appointing the engineer. SIR EDWARD GREY : We will just say to them that if they want a 4 per cent increase in the Customs dues, which will fall, in the first instance, on a large proportion o British trade, we want in return a working agreement, with the object that the naviga tion, the buoying and the lighting, shall be kept in proper order. SIR ARTHUR WILSON : Yes. [744] Fr I j 18 qtt? TTTi’XAT’A T? O IxHT^Y ■ ^Ye want an arrangement with them about the buoys, under whifh they leave to us the buoys outside territorial water. VISCOUNT MOI1LEY : Their buoys are not good, are they ? SIR AUTHUR WILSON • I think they are placed now all right. I have got their positions down on the chart. They are threatening to take ours away-at least our Consul says so—but I do not think there is any truth in it. SIR EDWARD GREY : I should be in favour of keeping it within the narrower limits that Sir Arthur Wilson suggests in the first instance, and letting this other question grow afterwards. VISCOUNT KITCHENER : We should try and get the line in the centre, and do away with this unfortunate line outside the other bank. SIR EDWARD GREY : We may try that, but .we are not proposing to go into that at the moment. This line would come in in the definition of their limits. VISCOUNT MORLEY : We are greatly obliged to you, Lord Curzon, for being kind enough to come. We will not detain you any more ; we will release you. LORD CURZON : Thank you very much. I would only like to say this: I think the suggestions that have been made are very valuable. The important thing is that, if you make this arrangement about Koweit, you should draw your line round Koweit, so as to cause as little trouble as possible in the future ; and do not land yourselves in future trouble with the Turks over Bubian. I do not say “ Get as much lor the Sheikh of Koweit as possible,” as I have no desire to add to his possessions but get as much for him as will save you from trouble with the Turks m the future. As we go further down the Gulf, you‘ have never disputed Turkish sovereignty all the way down the coast to Ojair (Ukeir), so try and limit to Ojair if you can. Ojair is above El Katr. You are going to insist, as we have always done* upon your protectorate over Bahrein. There is this question of El Bidaa and El Katr, which is rather a serious one. It would really be a good thing if you could do something there. VISCOUNT MORLEY : It would be a good thing, because, amongst other things it conduces to arms’ smuggling. MR. HIRTZEL : It has become the great depot for the arms’ trade lately. VISCOUNT MORLEY : I beg your pardon, Lord Curzon, will you go on. LORD CURZON : I was only saying, try and get them out of El Bidaa, if you can, and try and get El Katr declared free from their sovereignty, in which case it would be an addition to your Trucial Coast; you would then extend your Trucial Coast to Bahrein; and then it would be for you to settle later on whether you cared at all to strengthen your hold upon the Chiefs on the Trucial Coast. VISCOUNT KITCHENER: If it is not declared as Turkish territory, it would be open to anyone else to declare a protectorate over it. LORD CURZON: Over the Trucial Chiefs ?—They are bound by treates of course. VISCOUNT KITCHENER : We have never claimed them as protectorates. LORD CURZON : I forget the actual terms of our treaties, but they are bound, as far as I remember, not to alienate any portion of their territory to any foreign Power, are they not ? MR. PARKER : Yes, and they are not to receive a foreign agent. Those are the two points. MR. HIRTZEL : And not to correspond. {Lord Curzon withdrew.) [ Owing to a misunderstanding through the shorthand writer thinking he had to retire with Lord Curzon, some remarks here made by Sir Edward Grey were not reported.]i YlfeGOUNl MORLEY : The point to be settled by us is whether we on the whole assent to the articles in Mr. Parker’s Memorandum, which has been circulated to the ^omimttee, and to the suggestion to be made to the Turks which has been put forward ^ ^ . r W 1 ! 8011 - If the Committee agree to that, I will draw up something embodying it, and then we can meet again. We will send the report round, and that will save your time. VISCOUNT ESHER : I was wondering where Sir Arthur Wilson s suggestion could come in. Part of the Memorandum assumes that Koweit is going to be the terminus, so that half of that page is of no value now. SIR H. LLEWELLYN SMITH : I think it really would be simpler if a new document was prepared. It might help you perhaps, Lord Morley, if Mr. Parker were to prepare a revise in view of the new situation. VISCOUNT MORLEY : I was going to say I should be obliged if Mr. Parker would recast this page, on the assumption that the terminus is to be at Basra and not Koweit. MR. PARKER : I will do that, and add an addition about the Shat-al-Arab. 1 PRIXTKD AT THK FOREIGN OFFICE BY 1 . W. HARRISON.— 6 /' 7 / 1911 .PERSIAN GULF. || I Draft Report of the Standing Sub-Committee of theSECRET. r DB} DRAFT REPORT (Reference, G.S., G.S., Map, No. 2385 : Persian Gulf and adjacent countries— latest reprint.) THE/ three points on which the Committee were asked to advise were the following :— (1.) Did we really wish the Baghdad Railway to stop at Bussorah (Basra) or to he extended to the Persian Gulf? If it was to be prolonged to the Gulf now or at any future time, were we to insist that its terminus must be at Koweit ? (2.) Is it essential to the interests of our commerce to obtain legal sanction for our control of the navigation of the Shat-al-Arab and its approaches, includino- buoyage, lighting, dredging, and the right to lew dues on vessels navieratino- the river ? s ^ (3.) What are the utmost limits to an extension of Turkish sovereignty in the Shat-al-Arab and on the shores of the Gulf which we can agree to ? 1. In regard to the first point, the Committee are generally of opinion that the change which has recently occurred in the depth of the bar across the Shat-al-Arab has removed the principal objection which could be urged against the selection of Basra as a terminus. It is felt, apart from the obvious commercial advantages of Bussorah (Basra), that it would be a distinct gain to postpone the prolongation of the railway to Koweit, since,^ Bussorah (Basra) being indisputably within Turkish territory, many awkward questions, such as control of the customs, would thus be avoided. The Committee consider, however, that circumstances may be changed owing to future variations of the bar at the mouth of the Shat-al-Arab or to other causes, and that we should protect our interests now by stipulating, in the reply to be sent to the Ottoman Government, that if ever the railway is prolonged to the Persian Gulf the terminus must be at Koweit under conditions to be settled in agreement with His Majesty’s Government. In regard to the status of Koweit, the Committee deprecate the encouragement of Turkish interference with the internal administration of the Sheikh ; the furthejjkimits of concession to which it would seem advisable to go would be to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Koweit, and its ruler as a Turkish kaimakam, who, as such, would be entitled to hold land in Turkish territory ; but it should be stipulated that the administration is to remain autonomous ; that our agreements of 1899 and 1907, or any part of them, must be recognised by the Ottoman Government; and that the limits of Koweiti territory shall be defined in accordance with the suggestions made under (3) in this report. The question of replacing the political agent by a consul accredited to the Ottoman Government is one which might perhaps be considered. 2. In considering the second question it is necessary to bear in mind that there is likely to be some expense in keeping the channel of the Shat-al-Arab in its present improved position, as it cannot be assumed that it would otherwise permanently remain there; there will, if there is to be continuous traffic, have to be annual surveys, and probably some engineering operations. If expense is entailed in keeping open the navigation of the river it will be necessary to meet it by levying shipping dues, and foreign countries may demur to such dues being imposed on their ships unless they are levied by the riverain Powers, or they themselves have a share in controlling the navigation. The Committee think that in the first instance, as expense will not increase very rapidly for some years, and heavy dues will not therefore be necessary at once, an '[740]r 2 • w u ^ rponh ao-reement with the Ottoman Government, by urging attempt might be made to ^ ^ eat Britain pas done for generations m buoying and that, m view of the i&gt; onn^istiun of an Englishman and a Turk, with an st-&gt;• h ' “ d ^ ---» representation on the Riverain Commission m proportion to the percentage o eir shipping, c ittee do not consider that it would be possible to obtain legal sanction for British contro^of the navigation on the river, except by agreement with Turkey or Persia or both Powers, since Great Britain enjoys no teintonal rigi s. o As t0 t l ie third question the Committee do not think it would be P™dent to assent to any extension of Turkish sovereignty, tlio^gh they think that burki h ^nypmintv over Xoweit might, withm the limits specified m (1), be conceaea. limits of the territory of 'the Sheikh should be defined, and be made to include fr0m Tt l moTsou4 V eri; rl hmiron the coast of the Persian Gulf, to which Turkish jurisdiction should be recognised is, in the opinion of the FI Katif It appears inexpedient to make any concession to Turkey m repaid to 1 Iftr PediS, since th Sheikh of Bahrein has grazing and other nghte tnere, and the peninsula has importance, owing to its proximity to key nresent the sovereignty there is uncertain, and this leads to f llctl o n with i T fo encouragement to the arms traffic.

CHERADAME, on Monday, May 22nd). M. CHERADAME considers that the question of the Baghdad Railway is virtually almost finished—from the point of view of interna tional competitions—except so far as concerns the Baghdad trunk, Persian Gulf. France, England and Russia have, as a matter of fact, for a long time let pass the moment where their intervention would have been able to be useful; but the question of Baghdad presents still this interest that it can serve as an example as to what would be suitable to be done by the powers of the Triple Alliance when a great common interest will again be considered by them. M. CHERADAME remembers the origin and the principal steps of the development of the Baghdad question. He states that about 1903 a unique opportunity offered itself for France and England to intervene usefully. As a matter of fact the original concession given to the Germans and promising them a kilometrie guarantee of £600 (15,000 frs.) was only a promise on paper, for at the moment when this concession was granted the financial management of Turkey was such that it was impossible for the Turkish Government to find the thirty or thirty-five millions which it required to pay the Baghdad Company as kilometrie guarantee. In order to give the concession made to the Germans a practical character, it was therefore necessary to find a combination which enabled the Ottoman Empire to find the necessary funds by reconstructing the financial situation.German diplomacy saw that the only satisfactory solution from the point of view of its own interests was to provoke and to bring about the unification of the Ottoman debt. The complicated and long negotiations with this object reached their culminating and decisive point in 1908. It was then that France and England should have intervened ener getically to oppose all unification of the Ottoman debt as long as the Germans had not consented to internationalise, not only financially, but also from the point of view of political control, the Baghdad Railway. If this opposition had been made at the right time, and with the spirit to follow it up, either the real and effective internationalisation of the Baghdad Railway would have been obtained, or it would have been rendered impossible under the purely German form since the service of the kilometric guarantees would not have been made. Unfortunately this unique opportunity of intervention was wasted by the London and Paris Governments. The unification of the Ottoman debt took place at the end of 1903, and since then the Baghdad Railway has become a very effective German concession in Ottoman country. The Potsdam interview has caused an increase of present interest in the Baghdad question, but in reality all that is principal in this concession has been cut off by the fact of the unification of the Ottoman debt eight years ago. One must in any case regret that Russia before going to Potsdam did not try to come to a more solid understanding with France and England on the new attitude which she reckoned to adopt with regard to Baghdad. Be that as it may, the question of Koweit has still to be dealt with, so important as it is to British interests. One may enquire if on this account the Turko-German rail will not reach Baghdad until five or six years time, and on account of the uncertainties presented by the situation of young Turkey, England has not interest in waiting still longer before entering into engagements concerning Koweit, engagements which will perhaps be more suitable to British interests to take up only when the situation of the future of young Turkey will be clearer. fM. CHER ADAME further states the considerable importance of the cession of the port of Alexandretta to the Baghdad Company in exchange for the retrocession of its rights to Turkey on the Baghdad Gulf trunk. Thanks to this concession, the Germans obtained a magnificent port on the Mediterranean, of which the extreme political importance will be seen later on. M. CHERADAME concludes that in the Baghdad question the spirit of method of the Germans is by reason of the interests of England, France and Russia who have not known how to combine and of whose diplomacy has not shewn sufficient cohesion. In order to avoid similar checks in future, it is to be wished that men who in France, in England and in Russia exercise an important action on public opinion may have personal relations which enable them to discuss together the common interests of their respective countries so that a line of action equal to these interests may be adopted before the arrival of decisive moments, as was the case in 1903 at the time of the unification of the Ottoman debt.EASTERN DEPARTMENT SECRET SERIES. 118529] No. 1.

I HAVE received your Excellency’s despatch No. 214 of the 14th instant, report ing a conversation with the Fiench Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which he expressed his apprehension at the state of affairs in Turkey and the growing influence of Germany at the Sublime Porte, and his conviction that the latter tendency can be combated only by an understanding between Great Britain and France for joint action in Turkish affairs. I approve the language held by your Excellency to M. Cruppi on this occasion. Your Excellency should take an opportunity of informing M. Cruppi that His Majesty’s Government share his wash for a financial and general understanding between the two Powers respecting Turkish affairs, and you should invite him to formulate more precisely the lines on which he would propose that such an agreement should be based.

Sir, Foreign Office, May 18, 1911. I TOLD Count Metternicli to-day that we had not yet replied to the Turkish proposal about the Bagdad Railway. We could not accept it as it stood, but we should put forward another proposal, and we were now waiting for information from the Government of India about the Persian Gulf. Our objects were two-fold : 1. To secure that in practical working, and not only on paper, there would be no differential treatment of British trade ; and 2. To make sure that the strategical position in the Persian Gulf would not be altered to our disadvantage. Count Metternich observed that, in the Bagdad Railway concession, equal treat ment was promised for all trade. I pointed out how treatment which was equal in theory might be differential in practice, by the placing of high rates on goods in which we were specially interested and low rates on goods in which Germany was specially interested. If we were to concede to Turkey an increase of customs duties, which directly or indirectly would facilitate the making of the Bagdad Railway, we must, by means of our participation in the southern end, get some position which would be a guarantee to public opinion here that there would be no differentiation in railway rates. I said that, in conversa tion with my colleagues, I had always stated that it was not the intention of Germany to differentiate, and that when, as sooner or later must _ be the case, her assent was asked to a final settlement of the Bagdad Railway question, she would be willing to meet us on this point. 1 n n ,, Count Metternich assented, and confirmed the view that the German Government had no desire to secure differentiation as regards trade.

THE India Office letter of the 29th. March (“ Eastern Department : Secret Series” [12463]), containing the conclnsipns of His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India on the question of our participation in the international company to be formed for the construction of a railway from Bagdad to the Persian Gulf only reached me by the last messenger, but although somewhat belated, 1 venture to offer a lew remarks both on those conclusions and on the reasons on which they are based. The statement in paragraph 3 that “ it is not probable that in an international company to be formed for promoting a railway on Turkish soil Turkey will consent to reduce her share below the 40 per cent, proposed” appears to me to be open to criticism. The “international” company is in reality an Ottoman company, created in virtue of an agreement with the Porte, and subject to Ottoman laws and police, and its operations are wholly within Ottoman territory. Turkey therefore does not depend for its control over the line on the percentage of its participation in the same way that w r e must do for the protection of our commerce against differential treatment, and indeed, from that point of view, Turkey need have no more concern to have a financial stake in the company than it has, for instance, in the Smyrna-Aidin Railway. In fact, the reasons for Turkey having a large or indeed any holding in the proposed company are more sentimental than anything else. Turkey moreover has no money to put into the railway; she would have to borrow the money abroad on rather onerous terms considering the present state of her finances, and it is probable that as a business transaction the Turkish Minister of Finance would prefer not to be obliged to raise a considerable sum, which for some years is bound to be unremunerative. For these reasons I venture to think that it is by no means impossible to induce Turkey to agree to a very material reduction of the percentage of the capital of the “ international ” company. Again, as regards French participation, it appears to me that as Tve are leaving the field free to France in so many other parts of Turkey we may fairly expect that the French Government will defer to our wishes in regions where our interests are so greatly superior to hers. I am not quite sure of the meaning of the last part of paragraph 4, but if, as I suppose, it suggests that if we concede the 4 per cent, increase of the customs duties, British trade with Western Persia by the Bagdad route would be penalised to the extent of 48,000k a year, as compared with the trade by the Mohammerah-Khorremabad route, I must point out that there is a misconception. Imports to Persia by Bagdad only pay the transit duty of 1 per cent., and this duty is not Effected by the 4 per cent, increase of the import duties. In paragraph 5 it is implied that the whole of the increased import duties 'would fall on British trade. The Turkish contention is that they will mostly be borne by the consumer and the argument is one which it is not easy for the Government of a free-trade country like Great Britain to refute. In paragraphs 7 and 8 Lord Morley expresses the opinion that the balance inclines markedly to non-participation, and suggests that the Turks should be informed in the friendliest terms that His Majesty’s Government are unable to accept their proposals regarding the railway, and that, after carefully examining the situation, they have come to the conclusion that the extension of the line to the Gulf is not worth to them the price which they are prepared to pay ; and as they do not require the extension in the interests of their own trade, they do not think it necessary to put forward, counter proposals. The fact, his Lordship adds, that the German company have relinquished their claim to the increased customs duties makes it the more easy to adopt this attitude since the refusal of His Majesty’s Government to consent to them will no longer wear the appearance of hostility to the railway. In spite of the danger of making prophecies in this country, I will venture to make a forecast of the result of such a communication on public opinion and on the Government here. The press has [2026 ? —4] I i■ been constantly used to spread tire belief that our main condition for the increase of the customs duties has been that the proceeds should not be devoted to the Bagdad Railway—a view for which it must be confessed there is some httle justification, m view of the Foreign Office memorandum of the 23rd September, 1909, quoted in the Porte’s notice of the 10th April, and if, now that the German company has agreed FA, relinquish its claims to those revenues, we were to decline to agiee to the incieas^ of the duties we should infallibly be held to be guilty of a breach of faith. The Turkish need for new sources of revenue is moreover being- felt daily more acutely, and to refuse them after our main requirements have in Turkish eyes been fulfilled would provide a golden opportunity to the hostile press to proclaim against the hollowness of British friendship, and we should be denounced as pursuing a faithless and dog-in-the-manger policy. Ihe confidence even of oui fiiends would be shaken and a satisfactory settlement of the railway question, as well as of the many Gulf questions would be rendered Far more difficult. Ihe probabilities aie that negotiations would be entirely broken off, and that the I inks would turn again to the Germans to carry out the Bagdad Railway scheme in its original ionn, and it is possible that we should see the Gulf sections completed very likely quite as soon as the Mohammerah—Khorremabad line, on which Lord Morley lelres to piotect oui leisian trade. The Turkish railway would be built and managed, moreover, without our having any voice m it for the protection of our trade with Mesopotamia, a trade which is likely to attain important proportions as the country is developed by the Willcocks’s irrigation schemes. . , . Lord Morley also makes some remarks on the question in connection with our relations with Germany, and on two of these I venture to say a few words from the local standpoint. His Lordship suggests that a friendly agreement wdth Germany is essential before a satisfactory settlement can be discussed with Turkey. With the recent example of the Potsdam negotiations before us he cannot lose sight of the fact that such a course might cause some irritation to Turkish susceptibilities. Germany also could scarcely hope to succeed in layipg the onus on us as she attempted to do on Russia, and for that reason she would probably be averse from negotiating with us alone. The second point on which I wish to comment is the suggestion that the ostensible relinquishment by Germany of the concession for the Gulf section makes it easier for His Majesty’s Government to refuse to facilitate the construction of that section, since the refusal can no longer be interpreted as an unfriendly act to Germany. I Such an argument may perhaps serve in Berlin, but it would be useless to allay the . irritation in Constantinople which would inevitably result from our refusal to consent I to the 4 per cent, customs increase or to participate in the railway.

THE Minister for Foreign Affairs is very much perturbed at the state of affairs in Turkey and the predominance of German counsels at the Porte. There is every chance of disturbances in the Balkans before long. The revolt in the Yemen continues. The mortality amongst the Turkish troops sent thither to suppress it is very great, and the Grand Shereef of Mecca shows signs of shaking off the Turkish yoke. The Government of the Ottoman Empire by the Committee of Union and Progress is a failure. The Young Turk party has not shown the qualities which were hoped and expected of it. The recent changes in the Turkish Cabinet are ominous of an increase in the already dominant influence of Germany, which had enabled her to make arrangements most favourable to her own interests in regard to the Bagdad Railway, regardless of those of France and England. Matters cannot continue as they now are at Constantinople, and there rnay be a crisis at any moment and a seizure of power by a military dictator. All this was said to me by M. Cruppi yesterday. The only way in which France and England can hope to combat the predominance of Germany at Constantinople would, in his Excellency’s opinion, be an understanding between the British and French Governments for joint action in Turkish affairs. This gave me an opportunity to say that at Constantinople joint action, to be efficacious, should be financial as well as political, and that unfortunately the Ottoman Bank had invariably stood in the way when attempts had been made to bring about Anglo-French financial co-operation, the policy of that institution apparently having been to oppose any undertakings where such co-operation would be useful unless and until the bank itself was prepared to promote them and have the controlling share in them. I then gave to M. Cruppi instances in which the Ottoman Bank had so acted, and I went on to say that negotiations were now going on in London between representatives of the Turkish National Bank, the Salonica Bank, and other French financiers which were likely to fail owing to the obstructive attitude of the Ottoman Bank. His Excellency interposed to observe that information which had just reached him showed that Sir Ernest Cassel did not care to continue the business of the National Bank, and the pourparlers had consequently come to an end. I replied that I knew that in the interest of the Ottoman Bank it had been represented that such was the attitude of Sir Ernest Cassel, and that His Majesty’s Government were indifferent in the matter; but unless M. Cruppi’s information which he had just mentioned was of the day and positive, I thought that the position had been misrepresented. His Excellency said that he would make further enquiries as to the circumstances and result of the negotiations in London, and that he was all in favour of an arrangement for a fusion of interests. What, however, was essential for the defence of French and British interests against German opposition was an immediate understanding lor joint action at Constantinople. M. Cruppi did not say what the nature of that action should be or how it should be exercised generally ; but in regard to the Bagdad Railway question, respecting which he had learnt that you were now negotiating, he requested me to beg you most earnestly not to commit yourself in any way to consenting to a continuation of the 3 per cent, additional customs duties or to a further increase of 4 per cent, to them without consultation with the French Government, wno would give an undertaking to withhold any such consent by them without consultation with His Majesty s Government. Wffiat he desired would be that the British and French Governments ; should support each other in any negotiations, whether at Constantinople or at Beilin, on the subject of the Bagdad Railway, so that they might assist each othei m protecting British and French interests.

Memorandum of Interview—(Received at Foreign Office, May 10.) (Confidential.) I CALLED on M. Revoil at his hotel on the 4th May, but did not find him M. Kevoii returned my visit on the morning of the 5th. . 1 mentioned that I had seen Sir Arthur Nieolson, who had told me of M Revoil’s visit to him. I had gathered that M. Revoil was under certain misapprehensions which, perhaps, it was desirable to remove. He had mentioned to Sir Arthur Nieolson that the idea had been revived of a sale of shares of the National Bank to tt xT m ^ n i n -o' 1 Tlie [ e was not now an y such intention, and there was no possibility ol the National Bank or its shareholders now agreeing to any such proposal. M. Revoil then developed his idea at some length. that the Ottoman Bank should buy at a premium sufficient shares of the National Bank to give them control; that fusion should then be effected between the National Bank and the Bank of Salonica ; and that the National Bank should be maintained as a separate organ for Turkish business in England and English business in Turkey, with liberal arrangements as regards participation in loans, &amp;c. The Ottoman' Bank would be in a position of control, and would of course have representation on the board, but it would be their genuine and honest intention to use this organ for developing the interests of British capital in Turkey. The Ottoman Bank considered that, having regard to their established position and their past history, they were better fitted than anyone else to bring about satisfactory results in this respect. The maintenance of the name and separate existence of the National Bank would preserve appearances, and prevent any injury to the feelings of those who had founded the National Bank as a separate institution. I replied that this scheme would mean the extinction of the National Bank as an independent organism. The fagade would indeed be maintained, but the capital would be almost entirely French, and, having regard to the preponderating^ French character of the Ottoman Bank, it would be impossible to regard the National Bank in its new form as an independent representative of British interests. M. Bevoil then enlarged on the Anglo-French character of the Ottoman Bank. He pointed out that the situation was delicate, having regard to the existence and equal powers of the English committee. It was impossible for them to admit that they were incapable of dealing with all English business if the conditions of the market were suitable. In his view, a wrong course had been taken in establishing the National Bank independently of the Ottoman Bank, and it was necessary to find some means of retrieving this false step, and establishing not merely a cartel, but some more permanent tie between the two. If the Ottoman Bank were to contribute important resources in the way of participation in loans, it was not unreasonable that they should claim to have control. Arrangements of any kind would be very difficult so long as there was complete distrust of the English side of the Ottoman Bank. I said it was a question of recognising existing facts. The capital of the Ottoman Bank was mainly French, and in Turkey it undoubtedly acted as a purely French institution. Whether rightly or wrongly it had been regarded as essential, both by the Government and by the founders of the National Bank, to have an independent institution to represent British interests. I endeavoured to make it perfectly clear that there was no prospect whatever of any scheme being accepted which would terminate the independent existence of the National Bank, in reality if not in form. M. Bevoil was very reluctant to abandon an idea which, he said, was very much his own. He then explained his objections to a cartel. In the first place, it would imply recognising that the London committee of the Ottoman Bank was not capable of dealing with the English business, and, secondly, he did not see what the National Bank had to bring which would be the equivalent of what the Ottoman Bank would be expected to contribute. As regards the first point, I pointed out that the Ottoman Bank in Paris made [2026 k— 2 ]^ AM [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Govemmer) EASTERN DEPARTMENT.

IN reply to your despatch No. 94 of the 6th April, I have the honour to state that the reference intended was not to “working expenses,” but to “construction expenses.” As regards the precise nature of the compensation alluded to in the copy of the Bagdad Railway Company’s declaration, enclosed in my No. 213, Secret, of the 31st March, it is impossible to obtain accurate information. Turkish sources have apparently no definite ideas on the point until the matter is settled in conjunction with the Germans. M. Hu genin, the managing director of the Bagdad Railway, is reticent on the subject, biit one of his subordinates has confidentially hinted, in the course of conversation with Mr. Weakley, that compensation might not necessarily be pecuniary (on, for example, the lines discussed by Sir E. Cassel and Herr von Gwinner, vide former’s letter of the 20th December, 1909, to Sir C. Hardinge), but might take the nature of some other concession. He further remarked that a line from Bagdad to Mohammerah would probably offer greater advantages than a railway terminating at Koweit, which, he said, allowed of no further extension. The inference may be that the Germans might prefer the line being built to Mohammerah, and that, as regards England, they may intend to seek to come to an arrangement with her concerning railways and enterprises in South Persia, in connec tion with present negotiations, somewhat on the lines discussed at Potsdam with Russia regarding North Persia. He added that from Mohammerah there were possibilities of further railway extension as compared to. Koweit. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER.

E. GREY. [1969/—4] U5 t Sir India Office, 29th March 1911. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant on the subject of the Bagdad * To Governor-General, dated 18th f nd c ° nnecte d questions, and March 1911. m r epiy to enclose copy of telegrams'- 1 -' From ditto, dated 23rd March 1911. exchanged with the Government of India. 2. Since your letter was written a Convention has been signed between the Ottoman Government and the Anatolian Railway Company whereby the lattei relinquishes its concession for the section between Bagdad and the 1 ersian Gulf, on the understanding that it receives in a new company to be formed a share not less than that of any other non-Turkish Power, and subject to a claim to be indemnified for loss arising out of construction ex penses guaranteed on that section. The conclusion of this Convention no doubt facilitates the opening of negotiations between this country and Turkey. It also, in Viscount Morle} 7 ' s opinion, removes all inducement to open them. 3. When the written proposals of the Turkish Government w r ere received it was understood that they were not final, but were of a tentative nature, and did not exclude the hope that more favourable terms might be obtained for this country. To any such hope the door is apparently closed by the new convention. It is . not probable that in an international company to be formed for promoting a railway on Turksh soil Turkey will consent to reduce her share below the 40 per cent, proposed, and if that is so, unless France is to be practically excluded, it is arithmetically impossible for Great Britain to obtain more than 25 per cent. In 1909 the total trade of Bagdad was 2,918,120h, of which 1,954,000L belonged to Great Britain a*nd India, or about 67 per cent.; 237,739b to France, or about 8 per cent.; and 65,349b to Germany, or less than 2J per cent. Comment on these figures is unneces- sary, and Lord Morley believes that no Government that consented to permit the increased Customs duties in return for participation upon these terms, or upon any terms at all resembling them, could stand before the criticism that would be invoked. 4. This view,—in which there is, no doubt, an element of sentiment— is confirmed by an examination of the question on its merits as a matter of business. From this point of view I am to observe that, apart from pro viding profitable scope for British capital (which is not without scope elsewhere and is not likely to be attracted to an ^enterprise in which it will have to begin by paying an indemity to the original concessionnaires), the sole measure of the advantage of participation is the control that it affords ; and the degree of control afforded by a 20 per cent, or even 25 per cent, share is illusory. Nor, on the other hand, does it appear that we stand to lose commercially by non-participation, since, if it is possible to prevent the imposition of differential rates by either of the extraneous means suggested in your letter (a point on which Lord Morley would be glad to know the views of the Board of Trade), it is no longer necessary to secure any voice at all in in the management of the Company; while, whether it is possible or not, we must look more and more, (Lord Morley is convinced) to the Mohammera-Khorremabad line, if we can secure it, for the extension of our trade in Western Persia—the more so as trade by the Bagdad route will, if the increased Customs duties are to be the price of British participation, in future be penalised to the extent of approximately 48,000b a year. 5. It would appear, therefore, that no commercial advantage is to be anticipated from participation, and Lord Morley is of opinion that, when it s. 61 .is realised that it is no longer possible for the section to be a predominantly British undertaking, that the British share m it is not likely to exceed at the outside 1 , 000 , 0001 ., and that for the f ^ le f international company British trade is to be taxed between 300,000Z and 400 000L a year, no desire to participate in it will be found to exist m financial circles in this country. The conclusion to which he is driven is that for the present it is desirable on commercial grounds to stand alooi. 6. Political considerations appear to point m the same direction. His Lordship does not overlook the arguments stated m paragraph 10 of your letter under reply. But these arguments centre round Ivoweit, and it is precisely Koweit which-if it is to be the termmus-lurkey cannot afford to give up on the only terms which we can afford to accept; for alike m the official Turkish proposals, and m the remarks of Djevad Bey reported m bir E Grey’s Despatch to Sir F. Bertie, No. 90, of 14th instant, it is laid down that the terminus must be at a place under Turkish administration. While therefore Lord Morley regards a solution of the Koweit difficulty as woith the price*of considerable concessions, provided that the conditions stated m my letter of 3rd March are secured, he is inclined to think that from the Turkish point of view such a solution is necessarily inconsistent with the location of the terminus at that place. And if the terminus is to be elsewhere, Koweit loses much of its importance, and the price proposed is far too great to pay. 7 Judging the question therefore, as Sir E. Grey invites him to do, on “ its merits, and apart from the general effect of non-participation _ on the “ international situation,” Lord Morley holds that the balance, inclines markedly to non-participation, and he concurs in the conclusions indicated in the last two sentences of Lord Hardmge s telegram. 8. It therefore appears to him that every effort should now be made to obtain the Mohammera-Khorremabad concession, and that in the meantime the Turks should be informed in the friendliest terms that His Majesty s Government are unable to accept their proposals regarding- the rail way, and that, after careful examination of the situation (profoundly modified as it has been by the recent Convention), they have come to the conclusion that the extension of the line to the Gulf is not worth to them the price which they are asked to pay; and as they do not require the extension in the interests of their own trade, they do not think it necessary to put forward counter proposals. The fact that the Company have relinquished their claim to the increased Customs duties makes it the more easy to adopt this attitude, since the refusal of His Majesty’s Govern ment to consent to them will no longer wear the appearance of hostility to the railway. Lord Morley would propose that His Majesty’s Government should then wait and see the effect of this communication ; but he would urge now, as he urged m October last, that the further advance of Turkish pretensions at Koweit and in the Gulf must be resisted by all means in our power, and that it should be given to the Turks to understand that this attitude will only be relaxed when British interests are adequately recog nised. In view of the Turkish action in respect of Bahrein reported in &lt; Sir G. Lowther’s telegram, No. 66, of 25th instant, it seems highly desirable that this should be made clear at the earliest possible date. 9. His Lordship is, however, not unaware that this question cannot be treated entirely as a local matter, but that it must also be considered. in connection with our relations with Germany. But that is a subject of which this Office has no immediate cognizance, and he therefore confines himself to remarking (1) that a friendly agreement with Germany appears to him essential before a satisfactory settlement of the Bagdad Railway question can be arrived at, and indeed before the subject can profitably be discussed with Turkey; (2) that the ostensible relinquishment by Germany of the concession for the Gulf section makes it easier for His Majesty’s Government to refuse to facilitate the construction of that section, since such refusal can no longer be interpreted as an unfriendly act to Germany ; (3) that, unlessttie new convention is of a conditional nature, it is more than ever in the interest of Germany that the Gulf section should be expedited since, until this is done, the German Company will not receive the indemnity which they are understood to require in order to cover the construction expenses of the more expensive sections of the line. 1C).

HIS Britannic Majesty’s Embassy lost no time in forwarding to His Majesty’s Government the memorandum handed to His Majesty’s Ambassador by his Excellency the Minister for Foreign Adairs on the 1st March, 1911, containing certain proposals regarding the completion of the Bagdad-Persian Gulf Railway. These proposals will receive the careful consideration of His Majesty’s Government, and a reply will be sent in due course. In the meantime, His Majesty’s Embassy desires, under instructions from its Government, to call attention to the fact that paragraph 2 of the memorandum referred to, which deals with one of the conditions of the assent of His Majesty’s Government to the increase of the customs duties by 4 per cent., gives a statement of the conditions laid down by His Majesty’s Government which does not correspond with those which have at various times been explained to the Sublime Porte. The point of view always maintained by His Majesty’s Government has been that they would be unable to consent to the proposed increase for a fixed period if such increase were to be devoted, by setting free other affected revenues, to facilitating the prolongation of a railway which could not but have a prejudicial effect upon long- established British commercial interests in Mesopotamia. These views were clearly set forth in a conversation which his Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs had with His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in London on the 19th May last, and on the 20th July they were again explained at the Foreign Office to his Highness the Ottoman Ambassador in London, who was on that occasion accompanied by his Excellency the Minister of Finance. Subsequently these views were set forth at greater length in a memorandum which w r as placed in the hands of his Excellency the Minister of Finance when his Excellencv was in London. The Sublime Porte will doubtless also remember that His Majesty’s Government, in the course of the pourparlers regarding the question of consenting to the additional imposition of the 4 per cent., expressed the desire, in the interests of the internal development of Egypt, that the Ottoman Government should arrange to remove the restrictions on the borrowing powers of the Government of His Highness the Khedive imposed by the Imperial firman of the 7th August, 1879 (19th Chaban, 1296), and thus revert to the financial status quo ante of Egypt as indicated by the Imperial firman of the 25th September, 1872 (22nd Redjeb, 1289), and that of the 8th June, 1873 (13th Rabi-Akher, 1290). ■j 1 [1932 u —4]t GEM s Property of His Britarniic Majesty's Government] EASTERN DEPARTMENT.

There is an article by Lovat Fraser in the April number of the ' National Review ' contend- -ing that it is to our interest, on strategic ground^ that the terminus should be at Bussorah and not at Koweit.

Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 24.) (No. no.) Sir, St. Petersburgh, April 18, 1911 IN the course of a conversation which I had with the Acting Minister for Foreio-n Affairs yesterday, I observed that the Russian press had of late been devoting much attention to the Potsdam interview, and seemed at a loss to explain the slow progress that was being made with the Russo-German negotiations. - M. Neratow replied that all that he could tell me on the subject was that nothing whatever had passed between the two Governments since M. Sazonow had handed Count Pom tales the icvised text of the draft agreement. He did not know whether this silence on the part of the German Government was to be accounted for by their desire to wait till M. Sazonow was sufficiently recovered to be able to resume the conduct of the negotiations which he had initiated or to some other cause. He, personally, was inclined to believe that they desired to see what would be the outcome of the negotiations which His Majesty’s Government were conducting at Constantinople on the subject of the Bagdad Railway before replying to the last Russian proposals. M. Neratow then proceeded to speak to me on the subject of your conversation with Count Benckendorff, of which you communicated to me the substance in your despatch No. 105 of the 10th instant. His Excellency said that he thought it most important that the solidarity of the “Triple Entente” in the matter of the Bagdad Railway should be manifested to the world, and that he had therefore suggested that Russia, as well as France, should participate in the Bagdad-Gulf section. He understood from what you had told Count Benckendorff that tliere might be difficulties in the way of the internationalisation of this section ; but, if this proved to be the case, the object which he had in view might be attained by an amorcdlement of the line. I enquired whether he meant by this that the Bagdad-Gulf section should be divided into different tron^ons, as that would in my opinion be very difficult to arrange. His Excellency admitted this, and said that it would be sufficient if each of the three Powers acquired an interest in one or other of the different parts of the Bagdad Railway system. Thus were Great Britain to obtain the control of the Gulf section, Russia might be given the Sadidjeh-Khanikin branch, while France might take over some other section. I said that I believed that France’s aspirations were fixed on railways in another direction, and that, moreover, I did not quite see where she was to come in, unless it was on the Bagdad-Gulf section. M. Neratow thereupon suggested the branch line to Alexandretta, but I pointed out that this was an arrangement to which Germany was never likely to consent. I gather from the above conversation that M. Neratow desires to revert to M. Sazonow’s original idea of claiming for Russia the right to construct the Sadidjeh- Khanikin line in the event of Great Britain obtaining satisfaction with regard to the Bagdad-Gulf section (see my despatch No. 482 of the 9th December last). I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. [1969 aa—1 ]1 *C ^' Vii l:&gt;i -Q [This Docnment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] [April 21.] Shctitok 1. Foreign Office to Admiralty.* Sir, Foreign Office, April 21, 1911. THE Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty are aware that an agreement has recently been concluded between the Ottoman Government and the Bagdad Railway Company whereby the latter renounce, under certain conditions, their right to construct and work the section which is to connect Bagdad with the Persian Gulf as well as to construct the port at Bussorah or on the Gulf in favour of a new Ottoman company to be formed for these purposes, and that negotiations are at present in progress between His Majesty’s Government and the Ottoman Government to settle the question of British participation in the building and control of this section. It is stipulated that the German share in the new Power participating. The Ottoman Government have already communicated to His Majesty’s Govern ment proposals as to the nature and extent of this participation, and the reply which is to be returned to them is now in course of preparation. One of the most important questions for settlement in connection with the subject is that of the terminus of the line on or near the Persian Gulf. This question involves important considerations of a political, commercial, and strategic nature, and it is in regard to these last that I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to request an expression of their Lordships’ opinion. It is necessary in this connection to decide whether His Majesty’s Government shall make it one of the conditions of British participation that the terminus of the line shall be at Koweit (with the port under British control), and refuse to participate unless this stipulation is accepted, or whether it would be more to the interests of this country if the terminus were at Bussorah. As their Lordships are aware, Great Britain occupies a privileged position at Koweit, holds a lease of the foreshore, and has incurred special obligations towards the local ruler in virtue of agreements hitherto kept secret. The advantages of prolonging the line to Koweit are very great, as it affords the best natural harbour at the Gulf which large vessels can enter, whereas access to Bussorah is impeded by the bars, and would require a large initial expenditure to keep it clear. If British capital participates in the railway these are important considerations from an economic point of view, whilst the fact of the terminus being in the territory of a sheikh bound to Great Britain and on land leased by His Majesty’s Government would, it is thought, largely compensate for the disadvantages inherent in a strategic line to the Persian Gulf. It might further be stipulated that the harbour should never be fortified if, in the opinion of the Lords Commissioners, this stipulation would be of advantage. The attitude of the sheikh cannot altogether be ignored, and it is thought he would certainly welcome the advent of this line to his territory, and might possibly resent it if His Majesty’s Government stepped in to prevent it. On the other hand, it has been argued that certain disadvantages would attend the creation of a port at Koweit, which would then become the terminus of a great inter national line ; that it would be difficult for His Majesty’s Government to retain any effective control over the port, and that the tendency would be towards greater interference by Turkey, whereas if the line terminated at Bussorah these difficulties would not arise. Sir E. Grey would be glad to be favoured with their Lordships’ opinions on the point at an early date. * Also to Director of Military Operations, mutatit mutandis. company shall be equal to that of any other foreign EASTERN DEPARTMENT.

The writer rebuts the claim that Koweit is independent, and maintains that the sheikh is a “ Pasha ’’and “Ka'imakam ” of the vilayet of Bussorah, but rather weakens his argument by confusing the “ Moslem Caliphate” and the “ Ottoman Empire,” as also by his statement that the sheikh . . . knows that the Ottoman Empire is the sole refuge for all Moslems. As pointed out before, the title of “ Pasha ” which has been given to General von der Goltz, Lord Kitchener, and numbers of others does not necessarily imply Ottoman nationality or subjection, while though Sheikh Mubarek bore the title of kaimakain, or governor of a kaza, the Ottoman Government has never exercised authority in Koweit territory through military, police, customs or other officers, nor has it prevented the sheikh from contravening its laws and carrying on war with neighbouring Ottoman tribes, e.g., the Muntefik. The refusal of Sheikh Mubarek, mentioned by Abd-ul-Wahab, to obey the summons to proceed to Bussorah, Bagdad, or Constantinople, rather goes to prove that he was really independent. I would add that the suggestion contained in the India Office letter of the 3rd March, J911, concerning Koweit would seem to be on the lines of granting to the sheikh’s territory a status similar to that granted to Egypt by r Imperial firman. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1. Extract from the “ Tanin ” of April 10, 1911. (Translation.) Koweit in the Past, the Present, and the Future. IN view of the fact that Koweit may be considered as the key to Irak, and even to the whole of Mesopotamia, it is natural that the question should occupy the world’s attention. The “ Times ” and other English papers, while differing in various details, are united on some fundamental points. According to their claim, Koweit has been independent ab antiquo, and the English have an interest in Koweit. On hearing of this claim we were greatly astonished, for up to the present time the Kaimakam of Koweit, Sheikh Mubarek-es-Sabah Pasha, has never separated himself in any way from his Ottoman nationality. Mubarek-es-Sabah Pasha is an Ottoman and the son of an Ottoman ; that point is fully established by entries in official registers and by documents signed by his own hand. Sheikh Mubarek-es-Sabah Pasha has not hesitated to show his obedience and submission to the Government, both secretly and openly, and to keep his Ottoman nationality in its entirety. His predecessors—his brothers Sheikh Muhammad Pasha and Sheikh Abdullah Pasha, their father Sheikh Sabah, and their uncle Sheikh Jabir—admitted their Ottoman nationality with the greatest pride and loyalty. This admission, this bond, is very important for us; for the tie is our chief weapon in a time of conflict. Reference to official entries in registers proves clearly that Koweit is regarded as a dependency of Bussorah, as Bussorah is a mutessarifate under the vilayet of Bagdad.

His hi words also show 'the'bond that Ltes him to “ Ottomanism ’ ^ reveal ^i devotion and obedience to the Empire. The sheikh, like everyone else, the everlasting Ottoman Empire is the sole place of recourse for all Moslems and their crown of pride, and that to be faithful and loyal to that everlasting Empire is a sacred duty which comes before everything else. _ , i , J About nine months ago some meetings took place m my house between the lat Vali of Bussorah, Suleiman Nazif Bey, Sheikh Mubarek-es-Sabah Pasha the ^ 0 Mohammerah, Sheikh Khaz'al Khan, and all the notables of the vdayet This wa^ step towards clearing up misunderstandings and exchanging (marks o ) P amlt On that occasion I said a few words suitable to the time and place. During the course of the sittings which took place in my house I said, “ K , ow ^, ^ re ttert oy Empire.” The sheikh, far from objecting to this, received my words with the great J V and satisfaction. He promised that he would again accept the payments which he had abandoned for some time past owing to the maladministration, the dishon y, ^ the abuses of certain officials. Moreover, he undertook to build a pos tQ Ottoman postal service at his own expense ; and raised no objection to his g similar useful works. The “ Times ” claim about “ salary paid by Turkey to bhei Mubarek Pasha for the defence of Bussorah ” shows that it is not conv ^ sar ; ^ i facts. Turkey is not so unable to defend and protect her territory, thank Heav^ as to have to hire such means by the payment of salaries. The Time ° n ^According to the “ Times,” the Ottoman Government ordered invade Koweit; but that is the exact contrary of the truth. It was Sheikh M Pasha who joined the Sa‘oud tribe to make war on Abd-ul-Aziz-ur-Reshid. moment Ibn-ur-Reshid was in Irak. Immediately on hearing of t e ma Ottoman Government sent an order to prevent Ibn-ur-Reshid from moving o The man who transmitted this order was General (Ferik) Kiazim Pasha ’ a +m case a copy of the telegraphic order containing the Governments pro i i 1 exists.Similarly, the “ r Jimes” is wrong in stating that the Ottoman Government sent a war-ship to attack Koweit; so there was no cause for interference and threats on the part of England. All the Government did was to send a ship to tell Sheikh Mubarek Pasha to go to Bussorah or Bagdad or to Constantinople to he appointed to the ^Council of State. Mubarek Pasha did not accept this proposal, which was necessitated by the policy of the old regime; for it was not easy for a man like him to leave his country and his people and go to Constantinople. How could he expose himself to such a danger ? At that moment England backed up the sheikh, and said she would protect him. Whatever the question may be, I say openly that the maintenance of the policy and influence of the Empire in Koweit depends on appointing honest officials who will provide the good administration which Midhat Pasha declared to be necessary for the Sabah tribe. I am convinced and confident of Mubarek Pasha’s loyalty and friendship towards the Empire. His sole aim is to assure his future and that of his sons and descendants ; which entails Koweit being in their hands and their being the sheikhs so long as one member of the Sabah tribe remains. The European papers distort this fact; one rarely meets in them news with regard to our country which is not distorted. News concerning us is published after being cut according to the greedy aims of the Governments of the countries to which those papers belong, and the telegraph agencies work on the same principle and policy. It is in this way that the Koweit question has been sent everywhere by telegraph in its incorrect form, and that public opinion has been deceived.'I .

[April 8.] Section 1, board of Trade to Foreign Office. — (Received April 8.) (Secret.) ^ r ’ r aaa j- ii , ^ Board of Trade, April 7, 1911. I AM directed by the Board of Trade to advert to your letter of the 16th March, and enclosures, with regard to participation in the Bagdad Railway and other matters' and to the Board’s reply of the 22nd March, and also to a letter, dated the 29th March’ from the India Office to the Foreign Office, of which the Board have been favoured with a copy. With reference to the main question addressed to them by the Foreign Office, viz., what steps could be devised to ensure equality of treatment for British commerce if a system of internationalisation were arranged for the Gulf sections of the Bagdad Railway such as would not allow of preponderating control in capital and on the railway board to this country, I am now directed to inform you that the whole matter of the steps necessary to secure British trade from adverse discrimination on the railways of Asiatic Turkey has received the very careful attention of the Board. As a result, they have caused to be prepared the enclosed rough heads of two forms of agreement having the proposed object in view, and applicable respectively to the two cases in which Great Britain has or has not control to the extent of at least 50 per cent, of the southern section of the railway. It will be observed that the form and contents of the two draft heads of agreement differ fundamentally. In the first case supposed, the desired object could probably be attained without serious difficulty by an agreement as to the con ditions of through traffic between the new railway company, the Bagdad Railway Company, and perhaps the Anatolian Company. This aim would be materially facilitated if, in addition, one or two British directors were admitted to the boards of one or both of the last-named companies. The draft heads of such an agreement are enclosed (marked (A) ). In the second case supposed (which is the case assumed for the purpose of Sir Edward Grey’s question), the Board consider that nothing short of a formal treaty between Great Britain and Turkey would be of any use, and as we should, ex hypothesi, have no controlling power on either of the boards of management to prevent dis crimination, the only means of enforcing the treaty would be diplomatic pressure at Constantinople backed possibly by a threat of withdrawing consent (if given) to the 4 per cent, increase of customs duties. In the opinion of the Board of Trade, the articles of such a treaty, in order to be effective and to prevent evasion, would have to be drawn in a form not less stringent than those contained in the draft enclosed herewith (marked (B)). They cannot, how ever, conceal from themselves that insistence on such drastic conditions would be likely to hamper the ordinary commercial development of railway enterprise in Asiatic Turkey, and that it would be difficult to justify them from the point of view of British railway practice. On the other hand, diplomatic pressure at Constantinople, with its inevitable delays and uncertainty, does not appear to the Board to be a satisfactory mode of preventing or remedying, as they arise, cases of alleged differentiation, cloaked as they usually would be under various forms of adverse classification, delay of traffic, or other indirect methods of discrimination, without the adoption of a nominally differential tariff. For the above and other reasons, the Board cannot recommend this course, which does not appear to them to give to British trade any satisfactory recompense for our consent to the increase of Turkish customs duties ; while, on the other hand, if such consent were refused, we should be deprived of any effective lever to secure attention to our representations to the Turkish Government. Such study of this question as the Board have been able to make from a purely railway, commercial, and financial point of view has led them to the conclusion that there are only two practicable policies :— [1969 7i—1] B4. r J 1 To participate in the working of the southern section on terms of equality with Germany, but to the exclusion of all third parties as regards control. 2. To refuse participation altogether. Of these alternatives the Board strongly recommend the former if practicabW mu : C. t w f ov the purpose of maintaining legitimate British trade interests, Io %r ™n o tL board If directors is sufficient, d coupled either with a British chairman or,' if this cannot be secured, an alternating British and German chairman in succ™sive years Possibly the question of the control and administration of the actual terminal harbour on the Persian Gulf would need separate consideration. It would be absolutely necessary, and appears to the Board quite possible to devise effective means of securing that the British portion of the capital of the company or any part thereof which carries voting power, shall always remain in British Control. The Board do not think it necessary to enter into details on this technical financial point, but they have under their consideration several alternative methods of arriving at this object, and they will be prepared if desired, when the mestionof principle is settled, to discuss these methods with financial experts such, fin example as the authorities of the National Bank of Turkey, should Sir Edward Grey contemplate’ utilising that bank for the present purpose . T The second alternative policy is that recommended by the India Office in their letter of the 29th March, viz., to refuse the Turkish proposals to make no counter proposition, and to refuse consent to the 4 per cent, increase of duty. P The Board of Trade, as at present advised, are strongly opposed to the adoption of this policy, if it can be avoided. They are not directly concerned as a department with its probable effect upon the political relations between this country, Germany, and Turkey but it appears to them that it is not unlikely that its adoption might lead to a Turkish boycott of British ships and commerce, which would react chiefly upon the trade of the United Kingdom, and would cause grave dissatisfaction m commercial quarters. It is even within the bounds of possibility that we might have to face the repudiation by Turkey of her obligations as regards customs duties under the Capitula tions and the unilateral enforcement of the 4 per cent, increase without our consent ' If such an extreme step should be taken and receive the support of Germany, and it it could be plausibly represented that it had been directly caused by our unreasonable refusal to consent to a measure required by the financial circumstances of lurkey, the Board do not see what effective means of resisting it would be open to us, and m that event our control over the rates of Turkish customs duties would be gone for ever. The Board of Trade therefore submit, for Sir Edward Grey’s consideration, the desirability of taking some such steps as the following 1. An immediate confidential conference with the authorities of the National Bank of Turkey (or of any other financial institution through which Sir Edward Grey may contemplate working) to ascertain definitely whether, if desired, they would be disposed to take up the matter on lines satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government both as to the security of British control of the capital and as to the financial arrangements to he made between the new company and the Turkish Government. &gt; In this matter the Board of Trade will be glad to give any assistance that may be desired. 2. A confidential conference with the authorities of the Bagdad Railway, to ascertain if that company would be prepared, subject to Turkish consent, to co-operate in a scheme on the basis of forming a new company for the southern section, financed equally by that company and the National Bank of Turkey, subject to a satisfactory working agreement among the railway companies for through traffic, the admission o one or two British directors on the boards of the existing railways, and (if thought necessary) a separate arrangement for the construction and control of the termma harbour on the Persian Gulf. _ , , 3.

He had told Count Benckendorfl that the question _ as to whether France should participate in the Bagdad Gulf section was one which concerned us alone. She would participate if we wished her to do so, but she did not regard it as her affair. He was impressed by the desire of the Russian Government to retrieve the blunder which they had made at Fotsdam, and he took the same view as I did of their political intentions in the matter but it was very difficult for them to undo what they had done at Potsdam. He had also pointed out to Count Benckendorff that the consent of Turkey was necessary to Russian participation. J I observed that I had warned Count Beckendorff from the beginning that, while M. Sazonow should reduce as much as possible the difficulties in which he had become entangled at Potsdam, he should not break off' the agreement made there with Germany because the Khanikin—Tehran branch and the other inconveniences in the arrangement were not serious enough to justify a political quarrel between Russia and Germany which would suit neither Russia nor England, and which I assumed would not suit France either. M. Gambon asked whether he might tell Count Benckendorff, who was not instructed to make any proposal formally, that I would talk over the matter with him. I replied that I would do so next week; but I hoped that M. Gambon would explain the difficulties to him, as I should have to point them out to him when he came. I am, &amp;c. E.

Co-operation d trois r^-establSied° PPed ° Ut ° f Slgllt ’ and the Russian Government would like to see it I entirely agreed with this, but 1 explained to Count Benckendorff our difficulty with regard to the Bagdad-Gulf section. As a matter of fact, Germany had not renounced this section ; she had stipulated for a participation in it as great as that of a P^, 0 + thei ‘ 1 ower . ex 1 ce P t . lurk ey, and the German concessionnaires had reserved the right to claim an indemnity for loss of profit on kilometric guarantees. 1 also told Count Benckendorff that we had not yet sent in our reply to the proposals which the Turkish Government had made to us. When we did reply we should certainly point out that the position which they now put before us was quite different to that which Djavid Bey had suggested last summer as a possible way of meeting our views. Djavid Bey had then asked us whether we thought that a settle ment c o ul d_be reached if Turkey had a free hand with regard to the Bagdad-Gulf section. We had replied that this might provide a basis for a settlement, provided that, if the participation of foreign capital was invited, our participation was in pro- portion to our trade ; this would give ns about 60 per cent. In any case, it would be difficult to reconcile British public opinion to a bargain unless we had at least 50 per cent. But, m the new circumstances created by the German agreement with Turkey, if we had 50 per cent., Germany was also to have 50 per cent., Turkey would drop out of financial paiticipation, and the question would still be one to be discussed between us and Germany. . France, I understood from M. Gambon, wished to secure railway advantages in regions quite different from that of the Bagdad Railway ; and she would participate in the latter railway only if we desired her to do so, for she did not look upon it as her affair. My view was that Russia should make her bargain as she had begun to do at Potsdam. France should make her own stipulations with regard to the matters in which she was most interested. We ourselves should make the best terms we could about the Bagdad-Gulf section. I hen, when we were all three ready, we would simultaneously agree to the increase of the Turkish customs dues. Simultaneous agreement of this sort would have an excellent effect. Count Benckendorff said that the fact that Germany had not unconditionally i renounced the Bagdad-Gulf section made a considerable difference. He thought the ! Russian proposal was founded on the assumption that Germany was out of the question. I The Russian desire was to help us, and therefore their proposal w^ould not hold if the question was one between us and Germany alone. He thought, however, that if it was ultimately decided to have French co-operation, Russia should come in too, for the participation of Russia as well as France, entailing the division of the railway section into five shares instead of four, might just turn the balance in our favour. I agreed that if France came in it would be desirable that Russia should come in also, and if the negotiations took a turn in this direction I would bear the point in mind. Meanwhile, I thought it better to leave the question open, and I promised to let Count Benckendorff know how the negotiations progressed. It might be that, as a result of the terms which Germany had made with Turkey, the negotiations would revert to an attempt on our part to arrange a settlement with Germany and Turkey alone as the only way in which to get the large share in the Gulf section which British public opinion expected.

The Germans invited British capitalists to take part in the Bagdad Railway construction; but the proposal was rejected by the Conservative party, on the ground that the line would be opposed to British interests. In this there was also the idea that the Germans would be unable to accomplish the task unaided. Morley s statement that the apprehensions of 1903 were unjustified moves the “Times,” the Conservative organ, to reply, and to defend the Conservative statesmen. Our object in giving this explanation is to prevent the views of the “ Times ” from being accepted as the point of view of the whole of England. In a recent article the “ Times said that the British Government was to blame for not preventing the encroachment made by Ottoman troops on part of Koweit territory, and urged the Cabinet actually to interfere in case of need. The difference between the “ Times violent language and Sir E. Grey’s refusal to accept the expression “right of protection over Koweit” will doubtless not escape the attention of Ottoman public opinion. It is clear that no change has taken place in the Conservative point of view since 1903 ; it is clear that the Bagdad Railway is still regarded by them with an eye of displeasure. The “ Times ” says so openly; it argues that this railway is a source of danger to England and that it offers her no advantage. In our opinion the Bagdad—Bussorah line can never constitute a danger to England^ Since as the Times admits—she has no intention of seizing territory in the Persian Gulf or Irak, an increase in the strength of Turkey in those regions can never endanger British political interests. We are convinced that they themselves do not seriously believe that an increase in Turkey’s strength in the Persian Gulf would constitute a menace to India.

Mr. Mallet to Sir H. Llewellyn Smith M DearLlewellyn Smith, Foreign Office, April 3, 1911. I SEND you, by Sir E. Grey’s desire, a copy of a memorandum, prepared after our conference on the 30th March, setting forth the conditions on which His Majesty’s Government might agree to the increase of the Turkish customs duties from i 1 per cent, to 15 per cent, for a limited period. Sir E. Grey feels that whether the terminus is at Koweit or at Bussorah, it would be inexpedient lor His Majesty’s Government to agree to the customs increase unless the status of Koweit had first been agreed upon by us and the Turks. If we are sure of maintaining British control at Koweit, then primd facie it would seem advantageous that the terminus should be there, and if such control is to he secured there are serious drawbacks to admitting German participation, as it would involve the presence of German officials at Koweit, and would give Germany a voice in the concern of the Gulf. The port would, however, be administered in the interests of the railway and of international trade. If we cannot secure control of Koweit, then we must reconsider our attitude towards British participation in the railway, with its terminus at Bussorah, but in any case, as stated above, we could not assent to the customs increase or favour such participation unless the status of Koweit had first been regularised. There is an article by Lovat Fraser in the April number of the “ National Review,” contending that it is to our interest, on strategic grounds, that the terminus should be at Bussorah, and not at Koweit. Sir E. Grey is inclined to think that if we had real control at Koweit we could prevent the establishment of a naval arsenal there if it should ever be attempted, and that we could in any case render such an arsenal useless by barring the entrance to the Gulf (see report by the interdepartmental committee which sat here in the autumn of 1907), but he proposes to consult the Admiralty and the War Office on the point. With regard to the collection of customs at Koweit, Sir E. Grey would be glad to learn the views of the Board of Trade. I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET. EASTERN DEPARTMENT.

With regard to the annual sum to be paid by the Turkish Government to the railway company for the construction and working of the Halif-Bagdad section, I enclosed a table, in my despatch already referred to, showing that the amount would be about £ T. 400,000, while the surplus receipts assigned by the Government should yield about £ T. 405,000. This calculation was, however, based on the returns for one year (1910-11), and I have now had a further calculation made, taking the average results of tithe revenue surpluses lor five years, without allowing for almost certain increase, which works out at considerably less in favour of the Government, for, as you will see from the enclosed memorandum, instead of there being a slight surplus, there is an apparent insufficiency of £ T. 208,000.

I his port is m a way a set-off against the Gulf port and that of Bussorah granted to the company by the original firman, but now relinquished, together with their exclusive right to the Bagdad—Gulf sections of the railway. I am informed that the German company also reserves to itself the right to come to terms with the new company as to the indemnity to be paid by the latter to compensate it for the loss suffered in not constructing that section. Hussein Hjahid Bey, in the “ Tan:n,” which is practically the organ of the Minister of finance, and other Government organs, express great pleasure at the conclusion of these^conventions, and the hope that they will lead to a similar setllement with Great Britain m the matter of the Gulf sections, Koweit, and “ other parts of Ottoman territory m the Persian Gulf (the latter phrase may refer to Bahrein, Katar, &amp;c.), but tne lact that the Government refuses to submit these conventions to the Chamber indicates that it anticipates considerable opposition to their conclusion. According to the Concession Law which was the outcome of the “affaire Lynch,” all concessions involving a financial liability on the part of the Treasury must be submitted to the Chamber, and it is certainly straining the interpretation of the preamble of the 1908 convention to maintain that the reallocation of the revenues assigned to the Haidar * This table is inaccurate; see corrected one in Sir G.

At the same time, the proviso that m the event ot tbe laimre form the g new “ international ” Bagdad-Gulf company, the German company should he reinstated in her rights under the original concession, would seem to point to Germany s desire to be prepared for all eventualities, e.g., tbe breakdown of the ? . negotiation^ onAhtTsubject.

Minutes. The interesting communication will be the one which Rifaat Pasha was to give feir G. Lowther on the 23rd March (see the first page of this despatch) about the Gulf The passages about Bahrein and El Katr are important: if we could get a lavourable settlement of these questions it would be a distinct accomplishment, and we could hardly assent to the customs increase without such a settlement. The attitude oi (lermany during these negotiations will be curious to watch. She apparently has something to gam by a settlement, and therefore may urge moderation on the Turks. On the other hand, it might be unwise to confide in her until she comes out into the open, as it is always possible she is up to double-dealing. Mr. Mallet to see. Foreign Office, March 27, 1911. A. P. 1 v ^ It seems to me important steadily to keep in mind the main object we have ir ymw uamely, the safeguarding of British interests in the Persian Gulf and, subsidiarily, m Mesopotamia. . It was because we considered those interests threatened by the germap. monopolistic railway scheme that we have declined to assist Turkev oi German financiers, m carrying out that scheme. Our attitude has resulted in impressino i UI “ e y. necessity of obtaining from Germany a freer hand in regard to the Bagdad-Gulf section of the railway, so that Turkey now has something to offer to us m return for which we are expected to consent to increase of customs and to allow British money to be made available for the railway. It is the customs, and our hold over Howeit, which have been the lever by which we are beginning to secure some success. 1 his lever is available as against Turkey, and it is from Turkey that we want a satisfactory arrangement respecting the position at Koweit and generally on the TWk Th ere i: ore we should do well to continue negotiating with It is true that we are also desirous of coming to an understanding with Germany but this seems to me, at this stage, not the primary, but the secondary, consideration. It is probably more important to us to get a favourable settlement of the Gulf question m general than to agree about the exact proportion of British participation in the ^ 3 Jt is moreover only too likely, because in accordance with our long experience of German diplomacy, that if we were to agree to negotiate with Germany direct, she would after driving the hardest possible bargain with us, finally turn round to the lurks and, by some systematic misrepresentation such as their inspired organs are masters of, get Turkey to believe that it was England that was contemptuous of Turkish interests. , If we do not get satisfaction out of the Turks as regards our position in the Gulf, we shall gain practically nothing by any agreement with Germany. On the other hand, a direct negotiation with Germany might bear no direct fruit, and yet we might still come to a satisfactory arrangement with Turkey. Everything therefore points to the wisdom of negotiating direct with Turkey in the first instance and as the most important part of any attempt to carry out our policy. Any negotiation which we may carry on simultaneously with Germany ought to be clearly explained to be subject to the reservation that it can lead to no agreement unless we at the same time obtain satisfactory terms from Turkey. By making this O6 l/l 41 r * r\„-r„ a n svimxirt in inducing Turkey to come to quite plain we may hope to en is no t a sk Germany definitely to use her terms, and 1 see no reason wny influence in that direction OTelim i nary; we have made it quite clear to our own ' This presupposes that, as =* P™ m f would strongly deprecate entering mtoanj£\ o ' ci “t“a. o. Foreign Office, March 27, 1911. R. P. M. A. N. E. G. m JlI s o / \$ India Office, 29th March 1911. Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant on the subject of the Bagdad Railway and connected questions, and in reply to enclose copy of telegrams* exchanged with the Government of India. dated 18th * To Governor-General, March 1911. From ditto, dated 23rd March 1911. 2. Since your letter was written a Convention has been signed between the Ottoman Government and the Anatolian Railway Company whereby the latter relinquishes its concession for the section between Bagdad and the leisian Gulf, on the understanding that it receives in a new company to be formed a share not less than that of any other non-Turkish Power, and subject to a claim to be indemnified for loss arising out of working expenses guai anteed on that section. The conclusion of this Convention no doubt facilitates the opening of negotiations between this country and Turkey It also, in Viscount Morley’s opinion, removes all inducement to open them. 3. When the written proposals of the Turkish Government were received it was understood that they were not final, but were of a tentative nature, and did not exclude the hope that more favourable terms might be obtained for this country. To any such hope the door is apparently closed by the new convention. It is not probable that in an international company to be formed for promoting a railway on Turksh soil Turkey will consent to reduce her share below the 40 per cent, proposed, and if that is so, unless France is to be practically excluded, it is arithmetically impossible for Great Britain to obtain more than 25 per cent. In 1909 the total trade of Bagdad was 2,918,120k, of which 1,954,000k belonged to Great Britain and India, or about 67 per cent.; 237,739k to France, or about 8 per cent.; and 65,349k to Germany, or less than 2J per cent. Comment on these figures is unneces sary^ and Lord Morley believes that no Government that consented to permit the increased Customs duties in return for participation upon these terms, or upon any terms at all resembling them, could stand before the criticism that would be invoked. 4. This view, in which there is, no doubt, an element of sentiment— is confirmed by an examination of the question on its merits as a matter of business. From this point of view I am to observe that, apart from pro viding profitable scope for British capital (which is not without scope elsewhere and is not likely to be attracted to an .enterprise in which it will have to begin by paying an indemity to the original concessionnaires), the sole measure of the advantage of participation is the control that it affords ; and the degree of control afforded by a 20 per cent, or even 25 per cent! share is illusory. Nor, on the other hand, does it appear that we stand to lose commercially by non-participation, since, if it is possible to prevent the imposition of differential rates by either of the extraneous means suggested in your letter (a point on which Lord Morley would be glad to know the views of the Board of Trade), it is no longer necessary to secure any voice at all in in the management of the Company; while, whether it is possible or not, we must look more and more, (Lord Morley is convinced) to the Mohammera-Khorremabad line, if we can secure it, for the extension of our trade in Western Persia—the more so as trade by the Bagdad route will, if the increased Gustoms duties are to be the price of British participation, in future be penalised to the extent of approximately 48,000k a year. 5. It would appear, therefore, that no commercial advantage is to be anticipated from participation, and Lord Morley is of opinion that, when it S. 61. 1m % 4 ! • I r a +^ 0 + it iq no longer possible for tbe section to be a predominantly is realised that it - ^ Rritisli share in it is not likely to exceed at British undertaking, a for the privilege of lending this sum to an the outside l, 000 , 0 0 °L,and hat ior tne p^ betw « eii 3 00&gt;000l and “(» T year^o besire to participate in it will be found to exist m financial circles it this country. The conclusion to which he is driven is that for the present it is desirable on commercial grounds to stand aloof. 6 Political considerations appear to point in the same direction. His I ordshin does not overlook the arguments stated m paragraph 1C of j ou letter under reply. But these arguments centre round Lvoweit, and it letter unutu icpxj terminus—Turkey cannot anord precisely K-ett which-if it^is. to the ™. f or al;ke in the official' Tnrkish proposals, and in the remarks of Djevad Bey reported in Sir F ffi Pr«b Despatch to Sir F. Bertie, No. 90, of 14th instant, it is laid down Aauhe tenXs must be at a place under Turkish administration. While therefore I-lord Morley regards a solution of the Koweit difficulty as worth the price’of considerable concessions, provided that the conditions state 1 mv letter of 3rd March are secured, he is inclined to think that from the Turkish point of view such a solution is necessarily inconsistent with the locS S the terminus at that place. And if the terminus is to be elsewhere, Koweit loses much of its importance, and the price proposed is far too great to pay. 7 Judging tbe question therefore, as Sir E. Grey invites Inm to do, “ on “ its merits,,and apart from the general effect of non-participation_ on the “international situation,” Lord Morley bolds that the balance inclines markedly to non-participation, and he concurs m the conclusions indicated in the last two sentences of Lord Hardinge s. telegram. 8 It -therefore appears to him that every effort should now be made to obtain The Mohammera-Khorremabad concession, and that m the ^an ime the Turks should be informed m tbe friendliest terms that His Majesty s ’ Government are unable to accept their proposals regarding the rad- Tvny and that, after careful examination of the situation (profoundly -modified as it has been by the recent Convention), they have come to the conclusion that the extension of the line to the Gulf is not worth to them the price which they are asked to pay; and as they do not require the extension in the interests of their own trade, , the y J 0 ., n f necessary to put forward counter proposals. Ihe fact that the Compan} have relinquished their claim to the increased Customs duties makes it the more easy to adopt this attitude, since the refusal of His Majesty s Govern ment to consent to them will no longer wear the appearance of hostintj to the railway. Lord Morley would propose that His Majesty s Government should then wait and see the effect of this communication; but he would uro-e now, as he urged in October last, that the further advance of Turkish pretensions at Koweit and in the Gulf must be resisted by all means in om newer and that it should be given to the Turks to understand that this attitude will only be relaxed when British interests are adequately recog nised In view of the Tnrkish action in respect of Bahrein reported m Sir G. Lowther’s telegram, No. 66, of 25th instant, it seems highly desirable that this should be made clear at the earliest possible date. 9. His Lordship i§, however, not unaware that this question cannot he treated entirely as a local matter, but that it must also be considered m connection with onr relations with Germany. But that is a subj'ect of whicli this Office has no immediate cognizance, and he therefore confines himseit to remarking (1) that a friendly agreement with Germany appears to nun essential before a satisfactory settlement of the Bagdad Railway question can be arrived at, and indeed before tbe subject can profitably be discussed with Turkey (2) that the ostensible relinquishment by Germany oi tne concession for the Gulf section makes it easier for His Majesty’s Government to refuse to facilitate the construction of that section, since such refusal can no longer be interpreted as an unfriendly act to Germany; (3) that, uniebsthe new convention is of a conditional nature, it is more than ever in the interest of Germany that the Gulf section should be expedited s^nce until this is done, the German Company will not receive the indemnity which iO.

It says that though the Turkish sovereignty over Aoweit has for many years laid dormant it nevertheless exists, and that though through this sovereignty not having been made effective Great Britain has been able to obtain a footing there, the treaties she has made with the Sheikh of Koweit cannot be held as valid, as they are not recognised by Turkey. It adds that things now are not as they were, and, that with the regeneration of Turkey, a thorough examination and exchange of views on the subject between the two Powers concerned cannot be much longer delayed. ^ Ihe “ Kreuz-Zeitung,” at the close of a loug historical article on the subject of the position of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf, says that the necessity of putting an end to all doubts on this question has now become acute, and that, as it is in itself a question of right, the Court of Arbitration at The Hague would seem to be the proper place to have the matter definitely thrashed out. It adds that though it can hardly be supposed that, as the first and foremost champion of the principle of arbitration, Great Britain could refuse such a proposal were it to be made to her by Turkey, still it cannot be denied that there are certain difficulties arising out of the general situation which stand in the way of such a solution. In a second article on the same subject, the “Kreuz,” after scoffing at the British idea that in this question Germany stands behind Turkey, quotes largely from Mahan’s articles, and especially from an article by that w r riter in the “ National Review ” of September 190^, in which he comes to the conclusion that as long as Germany’s nearest harbour to the Persian Gulf lies in the North Sea, the Bagdad Railway, as far as that Power is concerned, constitutes strategically no danger to Great Britain. The “ Kreuz-Zeitung ” says that Englishmen will not fail to remark that Mahan’s article was written before Germany commenced to build Dreadnoughts, and that the situation has thereby been changed, and it adds that articles have appeared in the British press to the effect that, though Great Britain has the power to maintain her position in the Persian Gulf, it can only be done by weakening her naval strength in Home waters. This argument, the “ Kreuz ” observes, applies in a far greater measure to Germany, for if she detach even a fairly strong squadron to the Persian Gulf, how could she possibly defend her coasts against an attack by the British fleet ? The article then says : “ If we understand the policy of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf correctly, her idea is that she must exclude from the Persian Gulf any foreign fleet which is, or might become, strong enough to threaten India or the British sea-routes from the Suez Canal to the East. An effective means for realising this idea would be to set up a new Aden or Gibraltar, either on Persian or Arabian territory, at [1932 n —3 Iii n i-f Tn +Vii« r“-iqp France would have to be induced to sell her the entrance to the Gulf. In this case r ran« »o linr |„ 1 . 1 . tandin(r of ] 907 Rus „ ia migM r raise S diplomatic ^Ufficufties. 80 ' Still!the idea is not new and the creation of Br^h^finfluenee SflTniX events render it y coast; whose dut y it would be to close the entrancTto the Gulf when necessary. In both cases Great Britain would be true to her traditionalnolicv of letting no straits or narrow seas of any strategic importance fall into the hands of a great sea power. Both of these methods would, of course cost a Seat deal of money and would be a heavy charge on both the English and Indian Schequers ; they would, moreover, necessarily give rise to considerable difficulties and discussions. a third way for Great Britain to realise her aims if she really considers it so vital to her interests to keep any foreign maritime Power out of the Pers an Gulf • it is, perhaps, open to her to arrive at that result by diplomatic means. Whether Russia would lend herself to an arrangement on the lines desired by England is a question by itself. First and foremost it is a question between Great Britain and Germany and as Germany’s interests in the East are of a commercial and no a poliS nature, an understanding between the two Powers on the subject of the Persian Gulf would appear to be by no means impossible. . , ‘‘The particular question of Koweit is in itself a juridical matter-a question of rights If as such it was an isolated question, Turkey could not do better than propose to Great Britain that it should be referred to The Hagiie tribunal. It is, however not an isolated question, but one closely bound up with the numerous political and strategical problems of the Persian Gulf. But the whole koweit question would lose its importance, and the solution of the southern section of the Bagdad Railway become comparatively easy, if only an Anglo-German Persian GuU under standing could be arranged which would pay due regard to Great Britain s specia position and ber political and strategic inteiests. ... , • ? i. This is the concluding sentence of the article, and there is no mention ol what concessions or advantages Germany would, in the writer’s opinion, expect to gam from such an understanding.

THE Pan-German “ Deutsche Tageszeitung,” in an article entitled, “The North German Gazette and the British Press,” says that the recent article in the German semi-official organ on the Bagdad Railway question (see my despatch No. 55 of the v/ 7th instant), has had the effect in England of a salutary cold douche, and that its clear statement of facts is a welcome change from the endless talk in the British press about “undoubted claims” and “well-founded” rights. Regret is then expressed that the article in the “Frankfurter Zeitung ” (enclosed in my despatch No. 55 of the ^ 7th instant), was not more fully quoted in English newspapers, as the “ Tageszeitung” considers that the explanations of that organ were of a nature to make the case particularly clear to the average Englishman, which was extremely desirable in view of the fact that the opinion had been expressed repeatedly by English newspaper writers that the establishment of a “ German Gibraltar ” on the Persian Gulf would be intolerable to England. After reproducing several passages from English press articles on the vexed question of Koweit, the “ Tageszeitung ” observes that England might perhaps be ready to give evidence of her friendliness towards Turkey by publishing the terms of her ominous agreement with the sheikh.

FOREIGN papers continue to discuss negotiations which are supposed to be going on between Turkey and England about the Bagdad Railway. These discussions are m many cases founded on incorrect promises in that they do not take into sufficient account the legal basis on which the Bagdad question must be carried on. As as is well known the Bagdad question, as far as the construction of the line to Bagdad is concerned, has been finally settled between Turkey and the Bagdad Railway Company, t e above-mentioned discussions can only refer to the section from Bagdad to the ersian Gulf. Tins section too will, in common wdth the whole railway, run exclusively over Turkish territory. It is also included in the concession granted to the German company which imposes obligations on the latter vis-a-vis Turkey as well as on Turkey vis-a-vis the German company. There is, consequently, no reason, nor is there even a possibility either for Turkey or for the German company to carry on one-sided negotiations with third parties respecting the construction of the railway. If a third party, especially England, has any wishes respecting the railway, it is their business to formulate them and to communicate them to the two parties bound by contract. These wishes would then be sure of being examined in a friendly spirit. In another part of this paper we publish a long article of the “ Frankfurter Zeitung” dealing with the same subject. 1 1Ifl;' ' Pgcnmsat is the Property of His Britannic i-iyt Majesty’s Govenunsn)-. 1 EASTERN DEPARTMENT. &gt; ~ ' SECRET SERIES.

Grey to acknowledge tlie receipt ojf, your.letter Hi the drd instant, containing the detailed observations of the Secretary of State for ndia on the Viceroys telegram of the 23rd February respecting the position at vmveit; and I am further to acknowledge the receipt of copies of two telegrams,, dated the 7th March, from the Viceroy on the subject of rad wav projects in Mesopotamia and south-west Persia. / cr ^ re p r ^. to . a possible modification of the status of Koweit, I am to inform you tiiat bir E. Grey is m substantial agreement with the views of the Earl of Crewe, as stated m your letter of the 3rd March, with the exception of the first condition which jou enumerate, viz., that 55 per cent, of capital and control in the Bagdad-Koweit section of the Bagdad Railway would be inadequate as a share for this country. Vb 1 , regard to this suggestion, I am to point out that on the 31st May, 1910 bir E. Grey wrote a letter to Sir H. Babington-Smith, in which the following passage occurs :— “ 1 think that the British share should be 55 per cent., and that w^e should construct the harbour at Ivoweit and have a large share in its subsequent control.” copy of this letter was enclosed in the memorandum handed to the Ottoman Minister of Finance on the 29th July, 1910; and, in the same memorandum, certain alternative proposals were placed before His Excellency. Sir E. Grey is of opinion that His Majesty’s Government cannot now recede from what they have already stated to the Ottoman Government, and that 55 per cent, of capital and control would be the maximum share which they could now fairly claim, if the question were one of internationalisation under the concession of 1903. ; From the terms of the wnitten proposals of the Turkish Government, enclosed in Sir G. Lowther’s despatch No. 139 of the 1st March (of which a copy is transmitted herewith), it would appear that what is contemplated by the Sublime Porte is that the 1903 convention, in so far as it applies to the sections in question, should be cancelled and that another arrangement should be substituted. It is, of course, clear that the consideration of these proposals must be largely dependent upon whether or not they have the concurrence of the German Government and, both from the failure of Sir G. Lowther to elicit any precise and definite information on the point, and from the semi-official statements which have appeared in the German press, it would seem thad such is not indeed the case. Be this as it may, Sir E. Grey is of opinion that the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the proposals now made should be carefully considered in all its bearings, with a view to sending a reasoned reply to the Ottoman Government wdthout undue delay. 1 It is therefore essential to enquire whether, in the interests of British trade or on other grounds, a preponderating share of capital and control is a condition sine qua non of British participation in the enterprise. If a settlement on the lines desired should prove attainable in regard to Koweit, and if the 1903 concession is to be cancelled in so far as concerns the railway beyond Bagdad, and a formal international agreement substituted (such agreement stipulating, inter alia, that differential tariffs are absolutely excluded, and that the whole management of the line shall be conducted on approved methods), is it indispensable that British control, either in share-capital or on the Board, should be preponderating? Is it not possible that British control, in so far as concerns equality of treatment for British merchandise, could be rendered effective by stipulating in the contemplated international agreement or bi-lateral contract, that British assent to the desired increase in the customs is conditional upon the continued fulfilment of certain obligations by Turkey, and that default on her part would, ipso facto, determine the period of British assent to the enhanced customs tariff?

Six E. G rey would Me glad to have the views of the Secretary of State for India on these points. ^ The question of the kilometres guarantees is not alluded to in this letter, as it can well be reserved for subsequent consideration. / I am to express Sir E. Grey s full concurrence in the importance of avoiding any admissions with regard to the status of Koweit that may be used to our detriment should the present negotiations with Turkey prove abortive ; and, for this reason, he is anxioxis that the reply to the Turkish proposals should be drawn up in close consultation with your Department. /^Before leaving the subject of Koweit, I am to advert to the view expressed by the Marquess of Lansdowne, in his memorandum of the 21st March, 1902, that the British obligation to protect could not be interpi’eted as extending beyond Koweit “ proper ” to the outskirts. While Sir E. Grey is in agreement wdth the view that the Sheikh’a claims to \\ arba and Bubiyan might be upheld if it is really desirable to do so, he thinks that those claims could hardly be sustained with regard to Um Kasr, and certainly not as far south as Musulamiya Bay. If the terminus of the railway is at Koweit pioper (Bunder Schweikh) the importance of Warba, Bubiyan and Um Kasr is largely reduced. In any case, if an agreement with Turkey is reached, it will he desirable to define precisely the limits of Koweiti territory in order to avoid future friction ; and I am to suggest that, with a view to expedition, it might be desirable for the Government of India to be consulted by telegraph in regard to those limits. /yWith reference to the concluding paragraph of your letter, I am to draw your attention to the desire expressed by the Ottoman Government to define the position of the two Powers in the Persian Gulf,—a desire which, if marked by sincerity, is clearly satisfactory. /•f linally, I am to express Sir E. Grey’s opinion that it is extremely desirable, if only for tactical reasons, to obtain a concession for a line from Khor Musa and Mohammerah to Khorremmabad, especial^ as the concession need not involve more than an option to construct. /w CONFIDENTIAL /2* .^v IS MAR 1911 Sir G Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 10, 5*15 p.m.) (No. 58.)

SECRET SERIES. [March. 6.] Section 3. [8185] No. 1. Sir V. Corbett to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 6.) (No. 17.) Sir, Munich, March 2, 1911. THE question of the Bagdad Railway continues in no slight degree to occupy public attention here. Statements made on the subject in Parliament and the articles that appear in the British press are closely followed by the German newspapers, which lose no opportunity of insisting that the question is one that primarily concerns Turkey and Germany and only very indirectly Great Britain. The “ Frankfurter Zeitung ” of to-day’s date treats the matter at some length and with more than the usual frankness. After contrasting the attitude of the British and German press verj^ much to the advantage of the latter, the writer of the article goes on to observe that, in spite of all that has been written about it in England, British journalists have not yet succeeded in acquiring that clearness of thought on the subject which is so desirable. “ England’s dominion in India,” says the writer, “ her supremacy in the waters of the Persian Gulf, and her alleged protectorate over the Turkish town of Koweit are made the ground for claims which have direct reference to indisputably Turkish territory ; and—most important point of all—the English Govern ment is to be forced to claim for England the control over the so-called last section of the railway, that is to say, over a distance of some 600 kilom. from Bagdad southwards to the Persian Gulf. The granting of this claim is to be the sine qua non for reasonable and friendly relations with Turkey and Germany. Some particularly truculent journalists even talk about an assurance in this sense or a danger to the peace of the world. “ The question of the railway might be treated with far better hope of a satisfactory solution for England if our neighbours on the other side of the channel could get rid of a habit which is clearly deeply ingrained in their nature of confusing claims and rights. It seems to be an indisputable fact that England does claim an alleged protectorate over Koweit, and similarly the so-called control over the final section of the railway. This, however, is not the question : the point simply is, what rights England has over the terminus and final section of the future line. The wiser part of the English press advances no basis at all for such a right, and no one can take in earnest the grounds alleged by less prudent journals. No one will wish to prevent England from assuring her dominion in India, but to make the securing of the mastery in India an excuse for establishing English rights over ports and railways m ^outh Mesopotamia is as absurd as it would be to claim a suzerainty over Southern Italy. Koweit is just about as far from the nearest point on the Indian frontier as Portsmouth is from Naples. In the question of the alleged English protectorate ovei Koweit the Turks are notoriously of a different opinion from the English, and we have no leason to believe that their conception is the less well grounded of the two. But whether t le solution of the question ultimately gives England a partial or a complete protectorate over Koweit, her claims concerning the southern section of the line are not m e eas advanced thereby. To argue from a protectorate over Koweit to a contro o e railways in South Mesopotamia is like claiming control over the whole Spams rai way system on the strength of the possession of Gibraltar. It is certain, however, tia opinion in England on this point is now following a more reasonable line, and tms is satisfactory. The ‘ Statist ’ has recently shown with the utmost clearness that lurkey is absolute mistress on her own territory, with power to build sue rai ways as s e pleases and to treat with those companies which she has chosen loi this purpose. t- English newspapers could calm themselves more easily with the tiougi a ur ey has officially expressed her wish to come to an amicable unders an mg wi i English Government on the question of Koweit and the other su jec s connec ec it.

A reasonable settlement of all property disputes, the Sheikh taking out lurkish papers for his son, should also be included in the negotiations; and it would further be understood that if the question of tribute is not laised the Sheikh will approach the division of customs duties, &amp;c., in a liberal spirit. Whether the Turkish Government will be prepared to negotiate on this basis will presumably depend largely upon the value which they attach to considerations mainly of a sentimental order. On the other hand, the con cession which His Majesty’s Government are prepared to make, in facilitating the use of Koweit as a terminus for the Bagdad Railway, is of a very substantial nature ; and, in considering what we may reasonably expect to receive in return, it must be borne in mind that the position which His Majesty’s Government have built up for themselves at Koweit, and fortified by formal agreements with the Sheikh, is—together with the similar position which they hold at Mohammera —the one solid asset that they possess in those regions, and that they have been at pains to acquire it precisely for some such purpose as that to which it is now proposed to put it; while, quite apart from all question of compensation, this same position makes it impossible for them (as Mr. Marling has pointed out in his Despatch No. 14 of 4th January last) to abandon the Sheikh to the Turks without such a loss of prestige as would be disastrous to their general policy and interests in the Persian Gulf. For these reasons Lord Crewe would regard the conditions recapitulated above as essential to a satisfactory settlement. It is clear that in any negotiations that may be opened great care must be taken to avoid making S. 55.—2.foreign secret telegrams. Secret Department. F ro m Viceroy, 23 rd February 1911.

We authorised Cox, who was elicit Sheikh’s views without informing Cox telegraphed as follows :— grams of 27th January and 16th visiting Koweit, to endeavour to him of motives. On 10th instant .. .

Sheikh said he had always rejected these overtures first because he believed it was our wish that he should, and secondly, because ne thought that in virtue of our agreement with him ive should in due course achieve an adjustment of property difficulty on other lines. He personally believed that if he placated the Turks by registering his son(s), he would in iuture receive fair play in regard to his property in Turkey. As regards i eiihood of such registration ultimately resulting in Turkish interference at Koweit m spite of firman, he said that (he) would not apprehend it in his own case, a fid moreover felt Koweit was safeguarded by bis engagement with us, but that in this conn^ctioij 5 he considered that British Government were much better able to.gauge possibilities of the future than he was, and he must accept our estimate of them. Asked whether, in the event of the Porte’s being ready to grant firman in satisfactory terms, he considered that lie would be rendered quite secure if we obtained a documentary undertaking from the Porte that firman would he strictly observed, Sheikh replied in the affirmative. “ It would appear that sufficient recognition of Turkish sovereignty to satisfy Porte would lie provided by above means, and that Sheihk would not resent it provided oar engagements with him held good and were re-affirmed. “ As regards suggestion that Sheikh should pay tribute, I think 1 am right in stating that Sheikhs of Koweit have never paid tribute. Indications of their dependence on Turkey have been limited to receipt of compliments, annual presents of dates from Basrah authorities (?), honorary title of Kaimakam, and the sending of voluntary co-operation in emergency, such as that afforded to Midhat Pasha in 1871. These indications, which ceased in 1898, might be tacitly resumed; but payment of tribute would seem unnecessary and unexpected, and any suggestion of it would be greatly resented by Sheikh, and would create worst possible impression amongst other Arab sheikhs in relations with us. I earnestly deprecate it. “ As regards suggestion four. I presume ‘ control of port ’ means effective control on shore as well as afloat, such as we exercise in Egypt. Without that, position would be fraught, in my judgment, with innumerable impracticabilities, especially if last section of the railway were not under our control. “ Once Koweit had become terminus of railway and large commercial port with foreign business houses, questions of ex-territoriality, &amp;c., would necessarily arise and Sheikh’s crude regime would have to give place to more civilized administration, which must be under supervision of British Govern ment who would deal with Foreign Powers on behalf of Sheikh. “ Any formal recognition of Turkish suzerainty should include stipulation that Um Kasr Bubian and Warba be recognised as in the Sheikh’s sphere of control and present Turkish (? guards) removal. “ Further it would seem necessary to stipulate that recognition of suzerainty was specifically contingent upon definite decision to make Koweitforeign secret telegrams.

Otherwise, having brought about such recognition by us, Gei man \ might say on further consideration it had been decided Basrah or tao would be most convenient place of terminus.

It would seem it is tin’s consideration which will mainly influence selection of terminus. Settlement of ladaghia question can in my opinion await opening’of railway negotiations if not long deferred.” Proposal oi His Majesty’s Government involves change of policy and I earnestly recommend that there should be no surrender of our position until (1 we secure predominant control in Bagdad-Koweit section of railway, say b J per cent, of capital and control as minimum ; and (2) share with the Sheikh the absolute control of Koweit harbour and port afloat and ashore I would further urge as a (? corollary) that a specific assurance that terminus shall be at Koweit should be secured before concluding suzerainty negotiations. If these essential conditions can be secured, I generally support Cox's views. It would be better that there should be no question of payment of tribute; an arrangement under which Sheikh and Turks divide Koweit customs receipts to compensate latter for losses of revenue at Basrah would seem all that is required.

[December 31.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [47123] No. 1. India Office to Foreign Office.—(Received December 31.) Sir, India Office, December 30, 1910. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of the 21st and 24th December, regarding piracies in the Persian Gulf and the suggested visit of one of His Majesty’s ships to Zakhnuniyeh Island. In reply, I am to enclose, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of telegrams exchanged with the Government of India (together with papers received by mail relating'to the Mishri case),* and to say that the Earl of Crewe feels a certain difficulty in offering advice on these subjects. The possible presence of a few Turkish soldiers on Zakhnuniyeh Island is not in itself of such consequence as to justify the running of any risk, and certainly not the risk of the loss of prestige that would ensue if, for example, one of His Majesty’s ships ran aground in the enterprise. Similarly, the piracy, though it is of greater importance (since, as Colonel Cox points out, it took place on the high seas), is not in itself so important as to justify the courting of a rebuff, unless, of course, His Majesty’s Government are determined not to allow themselves to be rebuffed. If, on the other hand, these episodes are not taken by themselves, but as part of the whole policy of the Turkish Government as described in Sir E. Grey’s despatch of the 17th October, there can be no doubt that the material damage to the interests (mainly Indian) that have been built up in Mesopotamia by a century of peaceful and legitimate enterprise, and the loss of prestige in what we have—by considerable expenditure of life and money—made predominantly a British sea, warrant the strongest possible measures on the part of His Majesty’s Government. But the question then becomes one of such magnitude that, as Lord Crewe recognises, Indian interests must take their place among the wider interests which do not fall within the competence of the Secretary of State for India. Looking at the question from the Indian point of view, his Lordship would suggest that the time has come when it is not only desirable but necessary for His Majesty’s Government to explain clearly and comprehensively to the Turkish Government what their interests in those regions really are, and what is the policy that they deliberately intend to pursue, and, if possible, to arrive at some such general settlement as was advocated by Lieutenant-Colonel Cox in the telegram enclosed in my letter of the 9th December. The desirability of this course is illustrated by the extracts from the Turkish journal “ Tanin,” reported in the “ Morning Post” of the 28th December (copy enclosed*). The article from which these extracts are taken is apparently the result of the visit of Ismail Hakki Bey to Bagdad, which is referred to in Mr. Marling’s despatch No. 865 of the 29th November and in Mr. Consul-General Lorimer’s summary for October 1910 (copy of which was sent to your department on the 28th December). It appears to Lord Crewe that Great Britain is at present incurring all the odium, without obtaining any of the benefits, of an active policy at the head of the Gulf, and that in these circumstances no harm can, and some good may, be done by entering into the explanations suggested above. If these explanations were received in a friendly spirit and with a manifest desire to arrive at an accommodation (which, it may be admitted, is unlikely), the object of His Majesty’s Government would so far have been achieved. If not, it would probably be necessary to strengthen the squadron in the Gulf, so as to enable it to act inde pendently of the ^ blockade operations, and, by summarily removing all signs of Turkish authority from places where we do not admit their rights, and affording the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah material as well as moral support in their disputes with the Turkish Government, to convince the latter that we are in earnest If however, this course is on general grounds thought to be impracticable at the present juncture, Lord Crewe does not consider, for the reasons given above, that the two proposals immediately in question are worth pursuing separately, though he would favour such a cruise as the naval commander-in-chief proposes, with the * Not printed.

J This arrangement once concluded—and it was in a fair w r ay of being so—Turkish Government would propose to us, and parties interested, that Persian Gulf section should, while being an Ottoman railway, be internationalised. Great Britain, Germany, France, and perhaps Turkey being joint shareholders. Ottoman Government would prefer Koweit as an outlet, although Bussorah could easily be rendered serviceable, but that would entail an arrangement with us as to its political position. To preserve port should also be built by the international syndicate. His Excellency said he would eventually commit proposals to paper, but he wished us to know general ideas of the Porte. He told me that he would speak in a similar sense to my French colleague, but he begged that matter might be kept secret. CCi Y TO INDIA [152— 266]Ju C^ ^ , Ko.

They attach immense importance to the latter point, and, should it ever be deemed expedient to accede to the Turkish desire in the matter, such a solution might be made dependent on their resigning all claims to Bahrein, Pi Katr and every thing south-east of Ojair. The other assets we possess for bargaining are the ‘ Comet ” and the Sepoy guard at the Bagdad consulate-general. But as tongas lurkish constitutionalism is a mere travesty of popular institutions and is associated mainffi with the state of siege and secret court-martials, any settlement on the above lines, implying as it would the delivery of Koweit to the tender mercies of committee regime, would seem to be excluded. Should the committee eventually prove unable to establish an orderly Government and the Empire be brought to a state of anarchy, as in Persia, it might become necessary to consider the expediency of openly proclaiming a protectorate over Koweit and its dependencies; but, in the meantime any whisper of our intention to adopt such a course would raise a fierce storm both here and in Central Europe The recent report in the “Daily Telegraph,” which reached here through the “Neue 4 reie Presse to the effect that England was about to conclude an arrangement with . Germany that the Bagdad Railway should terminate at an “ English port ” in the Gulf, re., Koweit, called forth very angry remarks in the “ Tanin.” The writer concludes his comments by stating. that it is imperative to warn those who are working to establish foreign infliience in Mesopotamia, “the oldest and most attached province of the Empire, that their schemes are vain and that “ the mention of an English port in the Persian Gulf, to be established to the detriment of Ottoman interests and terri torial integrity, is the height of indelicacy.

SECnPTARVS N®,.^Sir, zsyi FOREIGN OFFICE January 20th 1911 I am directed by the Secretary of State for ioreign Affairs to transmit to you, for submiss ion to the Earl of Crewe copy of a despatch from His Majesty's Charge d'affaires at Constantinople enclosing a memorandum of a conversation which has taken place between Sir R. Babington-Smith and the lurkish Grand Vizier. Mr Marling discuss es especially the parts of the conversation rel ative to the Bagdad Railway and Koweit, and rais- es the question whether the time has ho’t arrived when it might be possible for His Majesty's Gov ernment to avail themselves of their acquired pos ition at Koweit with a view to securing - Securing The Under-Secretary of State for Indiasecuring British participation in the Bag- dad Kailway. Sir E.Grey concurs in the view that having regard to the long-standing relations of His Majesty's Government with Koweit, and to their close nature during the last few years, it would be impossible now to abandon tne Sheikh to the Turkish Government without incurring a disastrous loss of prestige. On the other hand he recognises that a settle ment of the question of Koweit can only be effected by including it in an arrangement concerning the Bagdad Railway. An indica tion to this effect was tentatively placed before the Turkish Minister of Finance on the occasion of his visit to England in last July, and for convenience and refer-ence I am to transmit to you a copy of memorandum which was handed to Javid Bey at the time. now iwen if it he deemed inoppor- tune'to approach the Turkish Government, it appears expedient to form a conception of what shape a settlement of the Koweit ques tion should take so that His Majesty's Go vernment might he ready if the question were suddenly forced upon them. Bir K.Grey would suggest that with a view to such a settlement(which would only he acceptable as part of an ar rangement for British participation in the Bagdad Railway), His Majesty's Government might recognise the Turkish suzerainty while stipulating for a full measure of home-rulemm. home-rale la the administration especially as regards customs matters, as to which the Sheikh is particularly jealous of foreign interference. The question might also be considered whether provision be made for the payment of a fixed tribute by the sheikh oo Turkey, for which he might pos sibly recoup himself by certain port dues on through traffic;- the continuance of the tribute to be subject to the equitable treatment of the Sheikh in regard to his dategroves in the Vilayet of Bussorah. As the Sheikh has already virtually admitted Turkish suzerainty by accepting the title of Kaimakam, Sir E.Grey does not antici pate that there would be serious difficul ty in inducing him to assent to such an arrangement,arrangement, especially as he Is most an xious that the terminus of the Railway should be at Koweit. A settlement of the question under discussion would probably only be satisfactory if it involved the control of the port by His Majesty's Govern ment and the Sheikh, thus excluding Turkish or German interference at Koweit in internal matters. It is not possible to estimate what leverage, if any, the situation of Ko weit gives Great Britain on the Bagdad Railway question until it is decided whe ther some such concessions as are above in dicated can safely be made, but the main lever for the settlement of these questions will consist in the power of His Majesty's Govern entGovernment to refuse their consent to the proposed increase of 4% in the Turkish Customs and to the continuation of the 3% increase beyond the month of April 1914 when the consent already given to that inc- rease will expire. Sir E.Grey will be obliged if the Earl of Crewe will favour him with his observations on the points raised in this letter.

Looking at the preseat aggressive attitude of the Committee of Union and Progress, which, as you are aware, is the real power guiding the affairs of Turkey, postponement would seem the wiser course.

Ihe lesson learnt by the refusal of the French Government to allow the late loan to be quoted in Paris has had its effect, and that there is a tendency m the committee to modify its chauvinism, at least, temporarily is shown by the substitution m the secretaryship of the moderate Haji Adil Bey, lately a; i of Adrianople, for the violent Dp Nazim. Time will, therefore, to all appearances, bring about a change for the better in our favour, but, on the other hand, the causes that are at work may operate slowly, and in the meanwhile articles such as those of + r ai i i-h 1 . no . t to mentl on hints which have already appeared in the local press that English intrigues are responsible for the troubles in Kerek—may do us some harm, even m the eyes of those sections of the people who have now no doubts as to the sincerity of our ‘friendship. Another danger from delay lies in the fact that the Turks desire the Bagdad ailway to be built. It is true that the financial arrangements have only been completed for the construction as far as El Helif, but, as the Grand Vizier implied to ] bir Henry Babmgton Smith, there can be no question but that the money will be found for the annuities for the sections as far as Bagdad. There is even reason to believe th a t negotiations for the purpose are already on foot, and it is thus probable at although the line cannot, actually be built for some years, the Germans may ' potentially reach Bagdad within a few. months, and will be free to turn all their attention and influence to asserting their existing rights under the concession to the agdad-Bussorah-Gulf sections. It is not, perhaps, out of place to remark here that [1852 1] Already printed : see [636] and [637]. } Ifay faer recent pourparlers with Germany Russia appears inclined to disinterest herself in the southern sections of the railway. . . In my despatch No. 942 of the 29th ultimo I expressed the opinion that too much importance need not he attached to the advances made by Rifaat Pasha to us for a renewal of negotiations for a solution of the railway question, but it is quite possible that if that question and that of Koweit were treated together we should find a ^ genuine and effective desire on the part of the lurks to come to an agreement. The prospect of gaining something at Koweit would be a powerful inducement to them to obtain from the Germans the latitude requisite for them to satisfy our icquirements in the railway question. It should be remembered that the main object in view when, eleven years ago, we entered into relations with Sheikh Mubarak was to prevent the Bagdad Railway from reaching the shores of the Gulf except under conditions consonant with our interests, and I venture to suggest that it is worth while considering whether the moment is not now approaching when we should endeavour to turn our acquired position at Koweit to account, and whether, if we do not now seize the opportunity, we may not eventually find that we have saddled ourselves with responsibilities towards the sheikh involving us in particularly thorny questions vis-d-vis of the Turks, without having reaped any commensurate advantage. Our position as regards the actual terminus of the railway at Koweit may still be secure owing to the agreement of October 1907, but we might now use the leverage offered to us by the Turkish anxiety to settle the Koweit question to secure our interests on the Bagdad-Bussorah sections ; whereas if we do not, and if we allow the line to reach Bussorah under purely German control, it appears to me that a very awkward situation might arise. A great difficulty in seeking a solution of the Koweit question at present will be to find a basis of negotiation. Turkish aspirations will, of course, be satisfied with nothing short of an acknowledgment of Ottoman sovereignty over the sheikh and his dependencies, but we have unfortunately, if I may say so, been led into such intimate relations with him that it would be impossible for us, with the examples of Albania and Macedonia before us, to abandon him to the tender mercies of the Turks. The loss of reputation to us both in Arabia and Persia would be immense, nor would the native mind be capable of appreciating the importance of the advantages we should have gained in connection with the railway, but would readily credit the Turkish version that we had been compelled to yield to the superior power of the present Government of Turkey. But on the importance of this in relation to our position in the Persian Gulf His Majesty’s Government will no doubt take the opinion of the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M.

The Grand Yizier also stated distinctly tnat it would be necessary to arrive at some arrangement satisfactory to England about the section between Bagdad and the Gulf, and expressed his readiness to bring pressure to bear on the Germans, if necessary, in this direction. I do not know whether the gene iP olltlcal sltuatl on as regards Germany makes it any more likely now that they would be prepared to come to terms ; but it is evident, in the first place, that we have no means of preventing the German line from reaching Bagdad, and, in the second place, that friction is likely to become more and more acute unless some settlement is reached’ buch a settlement would, in itself, improve our relations with the Turks also, and I confess 1 do not see why we should .not at the same time give the Turks some satisfaction regarding Koweit, if we obtain binding engagements regarding its alienation or use as a “ port de guerre.” I will not, however, write more on this subject, as I hope I may have the opportunity of seeing you shortly in London. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum of Interview with Hakhi Pasha, Grand Vizier, on December 29, 1910. ^ INFORMED Hakki Pasha that I was leaving for London in a few days, and that it ^ would be necessary to arrive at a decision regarding the future of the National Bank. As he was aware, recent events had raised grave doubts as to whether the bank could with. advantage continue its operations. The decision of this question would depend, in great measure, upon the prospect of obtaining active and practical support from the Government. The bank would never have been started unless the invitation of the Ottoman Government and the attitude of the British Government had given it expectation of support from both. Hakki Pasha said that in England there appeared to be a mistaken idea that, because a concession had been given for the Bagdad Railway, the ground was entirely occupied, and there was no room for any other enterprises in Turkey. This, he said, was a complete mistake. The Bagdad Railway was an existing concession. If it were to be given again, it would very likely be arranged in a different fashion ; but, anyhow, there it was, and it could not be revoked. But the Turkish Empire was large, and there was room for very many other enterprises which were open not only to German capital, but to British capital; and British capital would be heartily welcomed. I said that I did not think that this erroneous view was held hv an von p. wbn [1852/—3] i'great importance in the relations between England, Turkey, and Germany, both m itself and also in relation to the position m Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf generally. If the Bagdad question could be settled in a satisfactory manner, I was convinced that it would have an admirable effect on the relations of the three Hakki Pasha said that the question of Koweit was at the root of the Turkish 1 &gt; feeling about British action in that part of the world. On this subject he spoke strongly He said that he regarded it as beyond doubt that British action m relation to Koweit had been uniust. Under British protection, although there was not a protectorate m the technical sense of the word, Koweit was the centre of the contraband arms traffic, and a source of continual conflict with its neighbours. So long as this anomalous state of affairs existed, it was impossible to restore peace and order m that part of. the world. Koweit was like a thorn stuck in the side of Turkey ; and it was British action there more than anywhere else that had created suspicions of British aims in I said that I was not acquainted with the details of the question, but whatever the rights or wrongs of the matter, his Highness knew perfectly well that British action regarding Koweit was not directed against Turkey, but against the possibility of Koweit falling into other hands. The Grand Vizier said that he quite realised this, but that practically the action taken by way of defence against another Power operated as against Turkey. It was not in any way Turkey s interest or desire to permit any other Power to establish itself there. Even under the old regime, Abdul Hamid had not permitted the Germans to acquire a coaling station in the Red Sea. I he new regime would be even more strongly opposed to any such acquisition. If there were any doubt as to this, Turkey would be willing to take formal engagements as to the use of Koweit as a naval station. He said that, in his opinion, the matter was one that ought to be ! capable of settlement if there was good-will on both sides; but he complained that he had been unable to obtain a frank and full discussion of the question, which was the first condition of an understanding. I said that the matter was not one in which I was entitled to express an opinion, but that I saw with great regret the extreme sensitiveness of Turkish opinion as regards the most innocent and legitimate activities of British shipping and commerce in the Gulf. I referred to a recent article by Ismail Hakki Babanzade, in which the presence of British shipping at Bussorah and the extent of British trade there were treated as matters of offence and indications of sinister intentions ;. whereas it was clearly essential to the prosperity of the country to welcome all the shipping and trade that could come, whatever the nationality. Hakki Pasha replied that articles in the press must not be taken too seriously. Ismail Hakki Babanzade had just returned from Bagdad and Bussorah ; and what had produced more impression on him than anything else was the question of Koweit. The Grand Vizier then returned to the question of the Bagdad Railw r ay. He said that the Germans must be allowed to complete the line to Bagdad, but that he quite recognised that beyond Bagdad it was necessary to find some arrangement which would satisfy England. What precise solution was to be preferred he could not say. 1 he Germans had certain “ droits acquis,” and clearly any arrangement must be a matter for negotiation; and it was for the interests concerned to formulate proposals. The Turkish Government would be very anxious to arrive at a settlement, and would be prepared to bring pressure on the Germans with this object. One solution would be to make the line south of Bagdad an international one ; another solution would be that it should be a Turkish Government line, a suitable arrangement being made with the interests concerned for providing the capital. As regards the position of Turkey generally, he said emphatically that, in his view, it was most undesirable to give any one Power an exclusive or preponderant influence in Turkish affairs. He wished to remain on good terms with all the world ; and the interests of Turkey lay in securing the assistance of all the Powers equally for her development. I then spoke again of the position of the bank. I said that so far the bank had received no practical evidence of the Government’s desire to support it. No Govern ment accounts had been given to us, and the only semi-official account we had was that of the Commission de la Plotte. The Constantinople loan had only been arranged after competition with other banks, and after a struggle lasting over several months. I asked whether he could give me any assurances of practical support in the future which I could lay before our friends in London. Hakki Pasha said that, as regards Government accounts, their hands were tied to a very considerable extent by the termsof the concession of the Ottoman Bank. The Constantinople municipal loan had VATT P r °fi t sufficient fo cover the expenses of the bank for one year at any rate. 1 the bank had been able to conclude the loan recently under discussion, the profits would have provided for the bank for two or three years at least. Unfortunately, this had been prevented by the action of the British Government, which, he said, speaking W ^l tG unofficially, he could only describe as a blunder. If the British Government did not interpose any bar in future the National Bank would be able to take part in Government loans, either in co-operation with the Ottoman Bank or in competition with it. Apart from that, he repeated that the whole of Turkey was open to foreign enterprise, and that foreign capital would be welcomed. If British capital would come to take part m the development of the country, there would be a profitable field for the bank s energies. He regretted that British capital had taken so little interest in lurkey in recent years, and thought that both the press and commercial circles were not well-informed. He referred in this connection to the mining law, in the amendment of which the British Government had taken a great interest. The law had been amended, but in the two years which had elapsed since then there had not, so far as he was aware, been a single British application for a mining concession. ” I replied that British capital had had very good reasons for avoiding the country under the old regime; and in order to persuade it to come here now it was necessary to offer adequate inducements, and to create the conditions necessary for success. In the case of mines, for instance, the absence of roads and railways made all mines, except the richest, unremunerative. This accounted for the absence of applicants. As regards works of public utility we found, unfortunately, a certain want of practical sense in the Public Works Department. With the object of securing advantages to the State concessions were hedged round with impossible conditions. It would be to the real interest of the Government to grant the first concessions on terms which would make them thoroughly remunerative; whereas the conditions now laid down were such that there could not he a large profit, and that there might very likely be no profit at all. Hakki Pasha admitted that there was truth in what I said, but added that, in his own opinion, this difficulty would disappear in time. At the outset of a parliamentary regime, there was a tendency to criticise everything. In the endeavour to avert such criticism, the conditions had perhaps been drawn too tightly. Experience would remedy these defects. I asked the Grand Vizier whether they proposed to approve the Bagdad municipal loan. He said that he had been somewhat disappointed as regards the administrative capacities of Nazim Pasha, and that they had doubted whether the money would be satisfactorily spent if it were granted. He thought, however, that they would come to the decision to support Nazim Pasha still, and in that case they would approve the loan. I represented that it was very desirable to decide the matter as soon as possible, since my letter to Nazim Pasha, resuming our liberty of action in the matter, had probably reached him, or would reach him in a day or two. I added that it might have some influence as regard the future of the banks if I could point to one business, at any rate, though not a large one, which had been concluded. Hakki Pasha said that he would endeavour to hasten the decision. December 29, 1910. H. BABINGTON SMITH.BAGDAD RAILWAY. SECREL • 1 [27275] [.July 29.] Section 1. S3 IAM1Q11 i oMtM i br I J ' • No. 1.

In view of this conclusion, His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople was recently instructed to represent to the Ottoman Government that British assent to the increased customs duties must be chiefly dependent upon the satisfactory solution of the Bagdad Railway question, and, as a means of attaining this object, it was suggested either that British participation should be secured on acceptable terms in the portion of the Bagdad Railway between Bagdad and the Persian Gulf, or that the Ottoman Government should grant, along the valley of the River Tigris, a “ protective ” concession for a second railway, which was to be under the mats of a Turkish company. The latter suggestion did not commend itself to the Ottoman Government; while, as regaids the former, no concrete scheme has as yet been brought before His Majesty’s Government. In the course, howevei, of tentative discussions which have taken place within the past few days, the Ottoman Minister of Finance has put forward two alternative proposals as affording the basis of a possible agreement: the first is an arrangement for internationalisation, the second is for the construction of the line by the Turkish Government; both proposals are confined to the portion of the railway between Bagdad and the Persian Gulf. YV ith regard to internationalisation, His Majesty’s Government are aware of what has been discussed by Herr Gwinner with Sir Ernest Cassel. In their opinion, a solution might be found on these lines, but to be satisfactory to all parties it should not be financially onerous to the Turkish Government nor prejudicial to the future working and development of traffic on the railway. As His Majesty s Government understand that the purport of the negotiations between Sir E. Cassel and Herr Gwinner is known to Djavid Bey, they think it right to communicate to him confidentially a copy of the letter to Sir H. Babington- Smith, in which they have already expressed their own view. As for the construction of the line by the Turkish Government, His Majesty’s Government would, under certain safeguards, regard such a solution as satisfactory; but certain questions would arise the settlement of which might present some difficulty. For instance :— Would the Ottoman Government permanently control the railway when completed ; would they guarantee that British merchandise should not be subjected to adverse manipulation of rates ; would they be able to secure equality of treatment for goods of British origin or destination on the sections of the railway west of Bagdad; would they give to British railway contractors a share (proportionate to the volume of British trade in those regions, say 60 per cent.) in the provision of railway material and rolling-stock ; if, as would probably be the case, foreign engineers and foremen are [2825 ff—Y]employed, and if a foreign staff is required to work the railway when completed, would application be made to this country for suitable candidates, and would this country be given equality of treatment with others in regard to the posts to be filled ? &amp; Then His Majesty’s Government, realising the immense importance of the railway r as constituting the future highway for fast traffic between this country and the Indian % Empire, feel confident that the Ottoman Government will appreciate the necessity of selecting as the terminus of the railway a point best adapted to economy of time. His Majesty’s Government are advised that there is a consensus of opinion amongst those interested in shipping that the most suitable place for a port would be the harbour of Koweit: there ocean-going steamers of large tonnage could enter at all states of the tide and at all seasons of the year and, within a few minutes of leaving the open sea, could come alongside a quay where passengers and merchandise might, without loss of time, be transferred to the railway adjoining. On the other hand, the town of Bussorah is obviously not suited for the maritime terminus of a great trans-continental railway: situated as it is several kilometres from the mouth of a river which presents exceptional difficulties of navigation, especially at times of drought, if it became the terminus it would entail, even in the most favourable conditions of tide and weather, a delay of from ten to twelve hours in reaching the open sea : moreover, the tendency of modern steamers is to increase in tonnage, and ultimately the larger vessels would not be able to approach Bussorah, with the consequence that transhipment to smaller vessels would be necessary. His Majesty’s Government are further of opinion that, in view of the great predominance of British trade interests in the Persian Gidf, it would only be just d; ,t British contractors should build the harbour at Koweit; if His Majesty’s Govern- mont agreed to the customs increase while merely insisting that Turkey herself, and not Great Britain, should control the line of railway between Bagdad and the Persian Gulf, the least they could expect would be that Turkey should allow Great jir tain to construct, and to have a share in the control of the port at Koweit: indeed, she rt of some arrangement of this nature, it would be quite impossible to satisfy British public opinion and to defend the assent of His Majesty’s Government to the inc 'ease of customs. His Majesty’s Government, in making this proposal to the Ottoman Govern- rnent, have an earnest desire to co-operate with them in an amicable settlement of a question which, if it remains in suspense, may give rise to much inconvenience in future. There is one further point to which His Majesty’s Government wish to draw attention:—their desire that the Ottoman Government should consent to the removal of existing restrictions on the borrowing powers of Egypt: they feel confident that tu Ottoman Government will not fail to recognise how reasonable is this request, and to take it into their favourable consideration. From certain observations which his Excellency the Minister of Finance has made, H Majesty’s Government are led to conclude that the Imperial Ottoman Govern- it would deprecate the assent of the Powers being made subject to conditions to be embodied in a formal convention : His Majesty’s Government fully realise the ortance of this consideration and, with a view to meeting the wishes of the )man Government on the subject, they would suggest that the Ottoman Minister '&lt; Foreign Affairs should address to them a note, which if desirable could be regarded t confidential, conveying assurances with regard to the points enumerated in this munication: in such an event, and on learning that the other Powers had notified r assent to the Ottoman Government, His Majesty’s Government would be prepared ? gree to an increase of the customs for an initial period of three years, terminating m ipril 1914 when the seven years during which the former increase was to continue come to an end. If, at the expiration of the period in question, the arrangements which have been outlined were being executed in a satisfactory manner, His Majesty’s Government, 'Mio are keenly interested in the economic prosperity of the Ottoman Empire, would : ake no difficulty in assenting to the continuance of the increased duties (up to 15 per u n- ) for a further period, subject to the agreement of the other Powers. .

It appears to be generally agreed that temporising policy, -which ice have pursued for years past, will not serve the purpose with the 1 oung Turk regime, and 1 submit that their assertive attitude and recent attempts to upset status quo give us strong and imperative grounds for settling issues now” Ine general position is at present as follows. In their letter of 4th October last the foreign Office requested the observations of Viscou it Morley on he terms of a draft despatch which it was proposed to address to His Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople, “respecting the vexatious „ “ ie t nt ? f B , n ‘ lsd sub 3 ec t. s “, Asiatic Turkey, and the number of 1I i c ^ entb political aggression which have recently marked the conduct o the Ottoman authorities m the region of the Persian Gulf.” The draft despatch after enumerating the complaints of His Majesty’s Government concluded as follows :— ’ “These occurrences which individually have been the cause of painful surprise to His Majesty’s Government, have produced in their cumu- Jative eftect, an unfavourable impression as to the present attitude of le local Ottoman authorities, an attitude which appears to be one of hostility and aggression. “ His Majesty’s Government cannot believe that this attitude has the approval of the Central Government, or is based upon their specific instructions. I therefore have decided to instruct you to communicate a translation of this despatch to the Minister of .Foreign Affairs in order that his Excellency may he fully apprised of the views of His Majesty’s Government and of their causes of complaint ; in taking this step your Excellency should explain that His Majesty’s Govern ment have decided to make friendly representations, believing that the Ottoman Government will redress the grievances referred to, for a situation of very considerable gravity would of course arise if they proved to be the result of deliberate and unfriendly policy.” ^ S. 41./ 2 Lord Morley concurred in the draft, remarking that he “ is in entire acord “ with Sir E. Grey in thinking that the time has come when it is necessary to “ c-ive the Turkish Government a sharp reminder of the interests of Great “ Britain and India in those regions.” The despatch issued on 1/th October Then came the anti-British and pro-German explosion at Constantinople caused by the publication of a garbled version of the British note to Persia regardino 1 the restoration of order on the southern roads. The Ambassador took frhdit, and begged to be allowed to postpone communication of the despatch “until ill-feeling has died down ” (Sir G. Lowther’s telegram No 232 of 24th October); and the Foreign Office, without again consulting this Office, agreed (Sir E. Grey’s telegram No. 32a of 2bth October). Lord Morley thereupon addressed a letter (28th October) to the Foreign Office, which was of the nature of a protest against this change of policy, observing that “ Sir G. Lowther’s telegram No. 232 of 24th October contains no “ considerations that could not have been foreseen when the despatch m question issued ” ; that the object of His Majesty’s Government is “less “ to secure an adjustment of the particular incidents, than to nnpiess “ upon the Turkish Government, in a manner that shall preclude further “ misunderstanding, the importance which they attach to their interests “ in those regions, and their determination to see that they are respected , and that the probability of attaining this object would be “ greatly “ diminished if the general protest is long deferred, and if His Majesty’s “ Ambassador proceeds by means of piece-meal representations in the “ meantime.” To this letter the Foreign Office have not thought it necessary to reply, and we are therefore entirely in the dark as to what their general policy is. II. “ From a local standpoint ivhat is needed to clear the air is (1) that we shouUl cease to make a secret of our Agreement with Koweit, and should inform Porte that ive intend to make it effective. If ice can simultaneously eliminate anomaly of Turkish flag at Koweit, I strongly recommend itT The history of Turkish and British relations with Koweit will be found in pp. 155-160 of the Report and Proceedings of a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the Baghdad Railway, Southern Persia, and the Persian Gulf, dated 26th January 1909. We have two secret Agreements with the Sheikh. By the first, dated 23rd January 1899, he binds “ himself his heirs and successors not to receive the Agent or Repre- “ sentative of any Power or Government, without the previous sanction of “ the British Government,” and “not to cede, sell, lease, mortgage, or give “ for occupation or for any other purpose any portion of his territory “ to the Government or subjects of any other Power without the previous “ consent of His Majesty’s Government for these purposes.” In return he is assured of the “good offices of the British Government” towards himself, his heirs, and successors. The first of these conditions was inserted without the authority of His Majesty’s Government, and in approving it Lord G. Hamilton remarked that its “ operation, more especially with regard “ to the relations of the Sheikh to the Turkish Government, will require “ the careful attention of Your Excellency.” (Secret Despatch No. 11 of 30th March 1899). By the second agreement, dated 15th October 1907, we secured (a) the lease of a strip of land on the foreshore to the mouth of Bunder Shweikh; (b) the right of pre-emption in sale or lease of certain other tracts, including “ the entire island of Warba, situated near Khor Abdullah and the surrounding foreshore.” The Sheikh in the same agreement confirmed the earlier one, and expressly included the Ottoman Government among the foreign Governments to whom he is not to alienate Koweit territory. For obvious reasons secrecy was necessary, but the German Government were informed confidentially of the second condition of the 1899 Agreement, and if they know of it the Turks certainly know of it also.“ effective 0 ” is , ” eBn8 i by 1 , nakin « the agreement nevev arisen in whLh irwordd take effecl 80 ' 86 the Clrc ' mStauces [ ' a - a Hen’iafnf T &gt;1 ‘ V l b V neanS ® makin 8 explicit of what is implicit in it viz.

The Government of India thought that this “might involve us m responsibilities of a somewhat extended character ” (Secret Letter \ T o 193 fo- 2 / 4 , 1 Btecember iOOO, S. 2205). The Foreign Office were consulted 2ith January 190,), and the Ambassador at Constantinople was not opposed to according this guarantee, thinking it “ very unlikely ” that the Turkish Government would interfere with the Sheikh’s action (Sir N O’Conor^ Despatch No. 105 of 18th February 1907); but the Foreign Office have never replied to our letter, and the question has remained in a state of suspended animation ever since. 1 io W1 r 1 ! have 1 ' )e , en observed ’ from the passage referred to above in the Defence ( ommittee s proceedings, that the basis of our policy at Koweit has purported to be adherence to the status quo. This has been a convenient formula, but it is two-edged. The Turkish Government understand it in their own sense (and what that sense is is shown by the fact that they have made the Sheikh a Kaim-makam, and that they are applying the utmost pressure to induce him to register himself as a Turkish subject). We under stand it m om s. One of the difficulties is to define our own meaning. Thus, the Foreign Office were parties to the agreement of 1899. Yet in September 1901 they declared that “ there does not appear to have been any period since [1871] when His Majesty’s Government have not been ready “ to admit at least the suzerainty, if not the actual sovereignty, of the Sultan ” (foreign Office letter of 24th September 1901). For practical purposes the definition given by Sir T. Sanderson to Count Metternich a few days earlier seems sufficient, viz., that the status quo is “the Sultan’s authority as it exists in those parts.” Turkish authority “as it exists” is limited to the Turkish title conferred on the Sheikh (it may be noted that within the last few weeks the Sheikh has refused the offer of an allowance to accompany the title), the use by the Sheikh of the Turkish flag, and a Turkish guard sent to the island of Bubiyan, in violation of our definition of the status quo, in 1902. It would appear, therefore, that while there _is nothing in the agreements that could not he made public without violating the status quo, we could not deny Turkish suzerainty if the Foreign Office view of 1901 is sound; nor could we assert a protectorate in view of Lord Lansdowne’s pledge to the Turkish Government in 1901 so long as the Turks themselves maintain the status quo (as we understand it), and do not send troops to Koweit. A further question is whether the despatch of the Turkish guard to Bubiyan Island does not absolve us from this pledge.So much for theory. In practice it will be observed that His Majesty’s Government have at times been inclined to go somewhat further. In January 1902 H.M.S. Pomone landed guns to protect the Sheikh against an attack threatened by the Amir of Nejd and the Turks, and His Majesty’s Government, in spite of Turkish protests, refused to remove them so long as danger of attack existed. And in October 1902 His Majesty’s Government, while refusing to give the Sheikh guns for his own use, under took to defend the Koweit district (understanding thereby the district adjoining or close to the bay) provided that he fulfilled his engagements and took their advice. Our definition of the status quo seems therefore in practice to receive this extension, viz., that we should deny to the Turks the means of asserting even such authority as they may possess. (2.) “ That we should (a) bring about withdrawal of Turkish military posts from El Bidaa, Bubiyan, Um Kasr, Zakhnuniyeh, and Jinnah, and (b) finally to abolish mudirates at Wakra, Ac., and (c) induce Turks to confine themselves to their recognised possessions at Katif and UjairT (a) As Bubiyan, Um Kasr, and Jinnah stand on a rather different footing from the rest of the places mentioned, they may be taken first. Bubiyan is an island immediately to the north of Kow r eit, between Koweit bay and the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab. It is claimed by the Sheikh of Kow T eit, mainly in virtue of the fact that some of his tribes (the Awazim) use it for fishing purposes. But in 19l&gt;2 the Turks sent a small guard there, and the Ambassador at Constantinople was directed to protest. The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs stated.that he was not aware of the occupation of Bubiyan Island, though he knew that troops had been sent to Um Kasr; and he informed the Ambassador that the real motive of these proceedings was to keep a debouche for the Bagdad Railway under Turkish protection, as difficulties had been raised about extending it to Koweit (1912/02). In 1904 the Government of India recommended either that the Porte should be called upon to withdraw their post and that we should ourselves establish a post in behalf of the Sheikh at the northern end of the island, or that the Porte should be informed that w T e regard the island as belonging to the Sheikh, and that unless Turkish troops were ’withdrawal we should support him in establishing a post of his own (402/04). Sir N. O’Conor w 7 as thereupon authorised to repeat his former protest, and, after an interval of some months, if the post had not been withdrawn, to inform the Porte in the sense of the Government of India’s second alternative (2665/04). The first part of these instructions w r as carried out, and as regards the action subsequently to be taken the Government of India made the following recommendations in their telegram of 26th June 1905 :— “ Mubarak welcomes idea of establishing post, on condition (lj that British Government give him full moral support, inform Porte that they recognise his claim to Bubiyan, and support him in instituting post ; (2) Mubarak asks for following material support; (a) maintenance of Political Agent at Koweit as practically permanent; (b) occasional visit of man-of-v T ar to Koweit and Khor Abdullah ; (e) contribution by British Government of Rs. 500 for erection of guard quarters, and Rs. 100 a month for guard maintenance. YV e regard these terms as fair, and advise full acceptance. (Jost of (c) is less than subsidy sanctioned in your telegram of 17th January 1899. Sheikh suggests .more than one post, and visit by Cox' to Khor Abdullah should be sanctioned before number or location of posts is settled.” Ihe I oreign Office thought that this went rather too far, and the question w r as held over for consideration by the Defence Committee in connection w ith that of the eventual terminus of the Bagdad Raihvay (3249/05). In Septembei 1905 Sir N. O Conor again spoke to the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, but without drawing a reply. In August 1906 the Govern ment of India returned to the charge (1372/06), and the wdiole question (which.does not seem to have been considered by the Defence Committee) w r as referred to an inter-departmental committee (Foreign Office, Admiralty, and India Office), which, in its . report dated 2nd October 1907, recom mended that if diplomatic considerations permit . . . the continued ^ &lt; i &gt;cu P//^ on Bubiyan Island, by a Turkish post, in derogation of the k heikh s territorial claims (wdiich have been recognised and supported byX v \ t “ forthSof a 8 Wff• men t t) ’ ? i! 0,, , ld be lleutralised by the establishment “ ment on w4] n W r ’ 1 tH ? “'“‘enance of His Majesty’s Govern- “ prove undesirable ‘ nt ( ln:lmel |iately north of Bubiyan), or, if that should p \eimclesiiable, on tho northern shores of Bubiyan Island.

The Government of India reported in Sep ember 1908 that the Sheikh was not at the time anxious to move in the ehdh r ''f f aimS t0 . the / latter &gt; and His Majesty’s Government therefore decided to take no action (Secret Despatch No. 19, 30th October 1908), a decision winch, as has already been mentioned, was reaffirmed in April fast (oeeret Despatch No. 9, 8th April 1910). To Um Kasr the Sheikh’s claim appears to be much more shadowy than to Bubiyan [here is an old fort there, which is said to have been built by his grandfather, but m 1904 it was uninhabited. On the other hand the llT A^ w ^ re ie P 01 ted to have little claim beyond that of actnal occupation. Ihe importance of these places is indicated by the following passage irom the Government of India’s letter of 4th February 1904 : “ With the &lt;, ^ 0108 0l ( t ^ le ma i n land and of Bubiyan Island in the possession of a single •* Bower, the anchorages below Um Kasr and at Warba Island can at any time be converted into an impregnable harbour.” . Ji n]aa h has not hitherto figured in the correspondence, but it is an island r tz’ a Tmgside of the Island of Musallamiya, which is claimed by the Sheikh of Koweit. The Sheikh protested against the landing of Turkish troops on the latter island in 1902. It may he explained that the southern limits of his territory have never been defined, but the Government of India were of opinion that the Sheikh s claim to Musallamiya could not lie maintained, and that the island was clearly within the Turkish sphere of influence (Telegram 10th May 1902.) ' V 8 Of the other places mentioned as occupied by Turkish troops, El Bidaa and Zakhnuniyeh are south of the region known as El Katif, in which His Majesty s Government have recognised continuous Turkish influence. As will have been seen from paragraph 155 of the Defence Com mittee’s Proceedings, the southernmost point of that influence is Ujair. South of Ujair and on the El Katr Peninsula, His Majesty’s Government have declined to recognise Turkish sovereignty, but the Turks established a garrison at El Bidaa in 1872 and we have acquiesced in it. ^akhnuniyeh is 10 miles south of Ujair, and is claimed by the Sheikh of Bahrein. The Turks ran up their flag there in March 1909 and arranged to keep a guard there. The Government of India recommended that a protest should be made at Constantinople, and that the Sheikh of Bahrein should be allowed to fly his flag on the island (telegram of 23rd May 1909). The protest was made and the Ambassador was informed in September that the guard had. been withdrawn at the beginning of June. In these circumstances it was decided to drop the question of the Bahrein flag, the policy of His Majesty’s Government being to avoid disturbance of the status quo (telegram to Viceroy 13th October 1909) In November the Political Agent, Bahrein, reported that there were no Turkish soldiers on the island, but by April 1910 they had reappeared, and the Turkish flag was again being flown. The Ambassador again protested, but received only evasive replies (telegram of 16th August 1910). The subject was therefore included in Sir E. Grey’s despatch of 17th October, to which reference has already been made, and the Ambassador was instructed “ to request that orders may be issued for the immediate and permanent withdrawal of the garrison.” In a telegram dated 17th October 1910 Sir G. Lowther reported that the Porte had instructed the Mali of Basra that when the gendarmes left the island at ihe end of the fishing season they were not to return except under orders from Constanti nople ; and on 14th November he reported that the gendarmes had deserted. S. 41. Band conjectured that this was a Turkish expedient for avoiding formal with- drawal The Consul at Basra, however, reported on ^7th Octobei, that the Vali denied receiving such orders, and still maintained that the island belongs to Turkey. El Bidaa is on the east coast of the Katr peninsula, and, as has already been mentioned, the Turks have maintained a garrison there since 1S&lt; 2. iheir nominal suzerainty has been tolerated, though no communication has been made to the Porte to this effect, but attempts to extend their control have been resisted. The garrison recently consisted of 60 men and 4 guns. From all these facts may be gathered the degree of opposition to be expected if His Majesty’s Government announce at Constantinople their intention no longer to observe the status quo. (b) Wakra, Odeid, and Zabara are all on the coast of El Katr, a promontory south of the recognised Turkish sphere.. In 1902 it was announced that all three were to be converted into administrative districts. The British Government had already forcibly dispersed a Turkish settlement at Zobara in 1895 as being dangerous to the safety of Bahrein ; and Odeid had been held for at least 30 years to be the property of the Chief of Abu Dhabi, with whom we have treaty relations. Accordingly in March 1903 Sir N. O’Conor warned the Turkish Government against making any admini strative changes affecting the status quo in El Katr, and reminded them of previous representations made by His Majesty’s Government (e.g., in 1883, 1893, and 1895). In reply he was informed that the question had been discussed at a Council of Ministers, and that there was iio intention of sending mudirs to these places. Sir N. O'Conor had been unwilling to raise the whole question of Turkish sovereignty unless His Majesty’s Government were quite clear as to the policy to be pursued if the Turks—as he thought they probably would—merely reaffirmed their claims, and it was hoped that the incident was closed. But in the meantime a Turkish official had started for \\ akra, and succeeded in establishing himself there, and His Majesty’s Government had to press for his withdrawal. The Turks dismissed him, but appointed a local sheikh (Abdur Rahman bin Thani) mudir in his place, and it was not till November 1904 that His Majesty’s Government succeeded in getting the post altogether abolished. In August last the Consul at Basra reported that a mudir had again been appointed to Odeid, and Sir G. Lowther (Despatch No. 603 of 22nd August 1910) thought that this, along with their action at Zakhnuniya, pointed to “a determination to assert and extend Ottoman sovereignty in the neighbourhood of El Katr.’' He was instructed to hand in a written protest, “ pointing out that El Odeid is in the territory of one of “ the Trucial Chiefs who are under the protection of His Majesty’s Govern- “ ment,” and requesting that the appointment might be “immediately rescinded” (Sir E. Grey’s telegram of 20th September). The Foreign Office at the same time consulted the Admiralty as to whether it would be possible to effect a landing at El Odeid for the purpose of expelling the mudir, if His Majesty’s Government should decide to resort to forciblme easures. The Admiralty in reply recommended that the necessary action should be taken by Indian troops, the part of the Navy being limited to assisting in the landing operations, and they pointed out that the employment of the Royal Indian Marine Steamer Hardinge in connection with the blockade should facilitate any action which might be necessary. The Turkish Government, however, replied that they knew nothing of any such appointment, and had telegraphed to the Vali of Basra not to make it, and to cancel it if it had been made. I^ocal enquiry left little doubt that the appointments had been made both to Zobara and Odeid, although the new officials had not taken up their duties ; and on 21st October Sir G. Lowther was instructed to make a fuither protest, repeating that El Katr is “outside Turkish jurisdiction.” (c) With regard to the limitation of Turkish authority to Katif and Ujair, Sir G. Lowther, in his despatch of 22nd August, wrote as follows : — “ As regards Zakhnuniyeh, El Katr, and Bahrein which in a way form one group, the active forward policy of the Young Turk Vali of Bussorah and the Mutessarif of El Hasa (Nejd) have already brought us into sharp■A * from ihe Ae of hI « 0t ; al ?, l,thontleS - il wou,d seem necessary, subject to the “Tews of H s Majesty s Government, to take a strong tine For to the Turkish loThe T?uciai n coast 13 The' 4 ^ f T'* 8 St ° ne *° f E1 Katr ' a “ d Perhajs even ] uc . ia[ c °ast._ Ihe larks do not pat forward any valid claims to f ean'iharkev W th a “ l^T parts&gt; bllt h is not to ^ can tnat they base their claims on the fact that in the besrinnim? of tlm ibth cen ury a Turkish flotilla, under Kale Pasha, annexed Gwadnr in oou i a uc istan, and sailed up the Gulf, compelling the Arab Chiefs to acknowledge the sovereignty of the Ottoman Sultan and Caliph TheV further teel that as the dominant Islamic power they have undefined right to 1 -nZ^ e bia t n“X Ceand t0 pr ° teCUhe ^ Arab Moslem tribes, &amp; o, Sir E.

Moreover, as Your Excellency is aware, in November and December 1871 the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs himself gave assurances that his Government had no intention of attacking or obtaining any supremaev over Bahrein or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf and similar assurances had already repeatedly been given to Her Maiestv’s Ambassador at Constantinople. . a pa r t altogether from the assurances of the Ottoman Government to which I have referred, Ujair, in the district of El Eatif, is the most southerly point which His Majesty’s Government have ever recognised as being under 1 urkish influence on the coast of the Persian Gulf. these circumstances Your Excellency was instructed to request the Ottoman Government to withdraw the garrison from Zakhnuniyeh on the ground of terminating a disturbance of the status — — ——- quo; and your repre sentations weie to be based, not only on the title of the Sheikh of Bahrein to the island, but also on the fact that it is situated some distance to the south east of Ujair, the farthest limit of Ottoman jurisdiction.” III. “ That having achieved second hew, we should make treaties on lines of Trucial Coast agreements with Bin Thani, and, if necessary, with other headmen on the west coast of KatrT The question of making an agreement was first raised by the Govern ment of India in 1902 in connection with the desire of Sheikh Ahmed bin Thani to be taken under our protection, being alarmed at an intimation which he had received from the Turkish authorities that they intended to send more troops to those regions. The Government of India were in favour of the conclusion of an agreement, but in 1903 the idea was shelved because the abandonment by the Turks of the contemplated mudirates above referred to made it impossible for His Majesty’s Government to do anything themselves inconsistent with the status quo. The Government of India, however, in 190-1 suggested that without establishing a protectorate it might be justifiable to make such an agreement with the Sheikh as would secure the maintenance of the status quo and the exclusion of foreign interference, the Sheikh undertaking not to enter into relations with, receive the representative of, or cede territory to any foreign power. (Secret letter Ho 77 of 31st March 19(H). His Majesty’s Government had at the time a large number of questions outstanding with the Turkish Govern ment, and Sir N. O’Conor was unwilling to add to them, being moreover s. 41. c m bhbbe8 doubtful whether even the modified proposals of the Goyernment of India could be squared with the status quo. As a compromise the Goyernment of India proposed the revival of an agreement of 1868 made with a former Sheikh, but the Foreign Office (18th February 190o) : thought that this would be ineffective, and the matter was reserved for consideration by the Defence Committee along with the whole question of the Persian Gulf It is not known whether it was so considered, and it has not been heard ot since, until Sir G Lowther’s Despatch of 22nd August, from which quotation has already been made, and the Foreign Office letter of 4th October, m which the views of the India Office were asked for. _ „ . . „ We have in the present telegram the views of Lieutenant-Colonel Cox and the Government of India. They are as follows : (Colonel Cox):— “I consider that it would be useless now to make, treaty with Bin Thani, unless w (&gt; are 'prepared to do so openly, and to bring about elimination of Turkish influence of Katr, as suggested in second item above. Without such simultaneous action existence of treaty would only be source of danger to the Thani family from the present Turkish regime, and they would themselves fight shy of it. (Government of India) :— “ We concur with Cox that no advantage would accrue from treaties with Katr Chiefs, and further that Chiefs would probably not now agree to enter into treaties, unless the Turks can be induced to confine themselves to their recognised possessions at Katif and UjairT It will be observed that in 1904, when the local situation was ripe, Constantinople was not ready ; and that now, when Constantinople is ready, the local situation is not ripe. Sir G. Lowther in his despatch of 22nd August savs that “the time may not be far distant when, as advocated by Lord “ Lansdowne in February 1905, a comprehensive, as opposed to piecemeal, “ treatment of outstanding questions in the Persian Gulf . . . may “ become imperative.” The nearest approach that has been made to anything comprehensive was Sir E. Grey’s Despatch of 17th October, the fate of which has been described. If the settlement is to be friendly there must be some give and take. As to this Colonel Cox s view is : “ Whether achievement of above ends is possible by means of comprehensive reciprocal compromise, or whether coercive measures will be necessary, is a question beyond my purview, but I beg to say that I can conceive no quid pro quo which we could offer Porte in this sphere in exchange for withdrawal of her pretensions. It could perhaps be found in some other sphered' This will presumably be accepted. The only points of contact that we have with Turkey in the neighbourhood of the Gulf are things that both of us want and neither can afford to part with. “ Should coercive measures (Colonel Cox says) be necessary, ice can never expect the recurrence of such a, favourable junction locally as exists at present. The numerical strength of military posts in question has just been reduced to a minimum under Nazim Pasha's scheme for concen trating troops at Bagdad; while we have strong squadron in the Persian Gulf in connection with Arms Traffic, which would make naval demonstration simple matter.' The Foreign Office, as has been mentioned above, have already contem plated resort to force in the case of the mudirates in Katr, with the result— not uncommon in such cases—that it was proposed that India should perform the task. If troops are to be employed, it is perhaps natural that they should be Indian troops. But their employment would probably come within the scope of 21 &amp; 22 Abet. c. 106, s. 55 : “ Except for preventing or repelling “ actual invasion of Her Majesty’s Indian possessions, or under other sudden “ and urgent necessity, the revenues of India shall not, without the consent “ of both Houses of Parliament, be applicable to defray the expenses of any “ military operation carried on beyond the external frontiers of such “ possessions by Her Majesty’s forces charged upon such revenues.” It is « »I y the regarded employment of Indian troops . as covered hy the Act. as a military operation, whereas could hardly be described otherwise, since Parliamentary discussion might in the naval blockade has Put that can hardly be the ejection of Turkish That, however, is perhaps be inevitable in any case. true that not been described garrisons a detail ipDorff rd TV,p e p° Cal slt , natlou . Colonel Cox’s views are borne out by recent to tL milb ' Aft a ‘ Iia ? dad has than once called attention ho noted ■,fi ‘ r ' I 1 rovmce - ,l ' Cie August Summary (page 14) he noted that after denuding a large part of the country of troops Nazim asha had only been able to concentrate some 3,000 men at Bagdad, a number not more than a sufficient garrison for the capital. In order to effect this concentration the forces in Hasa have lately been considerably reduced ; foliou 7 %? men Were w ! thdr r n (1 f from E1 Bidaa ). a ml 200 more were to follow Ihese were not to be replaced, but in cases of emergency troops oioT AlT/ m r T aSI ' a (lett f kT Political Agent, Bahrein, 24th July I n t J 317 /^), the garrison of which the Consul-General, Bagdad, put at one battalion (September Summary, page 5). There remained 70 infantry (to be raised to 100 probably) 40 police, and 6 guns at Katif ; 60 infantry and 4 guns at M Bidaa ; 50 infantry and 2 guns at Ujair; and about 600 infantry, . , ca y alr .y, lo0 police, and 12 guns at Hofuf (the capital of Hasa, 40 miles inland from Ujair). . 11 rema i n s to consider the question of a treaty with the Katr Sheikh on its merits Arguments m favour of it are given on page 4 of Sir R, Ritchie’s memorandum of 30th January 1905. Since that date the case for a treaty has become somewhat stronger. For example, the Katr peninsula is the only part of the coast of the Persian Gulf on which the arms traffic is not pro- hi hi ted, and it tends to he a dumping ground in consequence ; thus we heard on oth December that a dhow under French colours had left Muscat in that direction. If we had a treaty our chain of defences would be complete Again with regard to the pearl fisheries, the Law Officers in answering the reference made to them had no doubt as to the rights of the tribes in such waters as may justly be considered territorial. Outside these they were inclined to hold that the exclusive rights of the tribes might be maintained to banks in regard to which their exclusive possession is capable of historical proof ; but they considered that the point was not free from doubt. And as regards the deeper waters they were of opinion that there wmuld be no reasonable chance of asserting with success the right of the tribes to debar othei nations Irom dredging. In these circumstances the Secretary of State agreed with the general conclusion of the Law Officers, viz., that it was not expedient to raise the question internationally by forcibly preventing vessels of _ foreign nationalties from fishing on the banks. And he added, “ The object in view may probably be attainable by indirect methods.” (Secret Despatch No. 8, of 31st March 1905.) These indirect methods, which would consist mainly in putting difficulties in the way of interlopers, could probably only be successfully employed if our position vis-a-vis of the tribes were such as would be secured to ns by the proposed treaties. With regard to the terms of such treaties, it has been suggested that they should follow the lines of the 1893 agreements with the Trucial Chiefs. These provide (1) that the Chiefs will on no account enter into any agreement or correspondence with any power other than the Pritish Government ; (2) that without the assent of the Pritish Government they will not consent to the residence within their territory of the Agent of any other Government; (3) that they will on no account cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation, any part of their territory, save to the Pritish Government. CONCLUSIONS. Achievement of above measures would completely consolidate our position on Arab coast and in Gulf generally, especially in regard to peart fishery question, and, if it is ever to be brought about, it seems essential that action should be taken now. If it is delayed, the suggested association of Turkey with Triple Alliance and increaser L r \ 10 of her- navi) may render task very difficult, if not impossible. In any case therefore, by one method or another, I respectfully. urge necessity of adjusting position with Turkey forthwith, and eliminating chronic elements of friction which have now become dangerous.” The conclusions to which these considerations seem to point die as follows:— (1.) It is desirable to conclude treaties with the Katr tribes. _ (2.) It is not possible to do so unless we can guarantee them against I uikish aggression. (3.) There seem to be three ways of arriving at such a guarantee— (a) A comprehensive settlement by friendly agreement. Ihe materials for this do not appear to be forthcoming. (h) A comprehensive settlement by announcement to the Turks that we do not recognise their position at Koweit and south of Uiair, and the translation of that announcement into action by the removal of all signs of Turkish authority. I his wou Id obviously be a serious measure, but it might perhaps be taken in reply to some particularly objectionable action on the part ofhhe Turks, either in the Gulf or elsewhere, such as will doubtless be forthcoming before long. A piecemeal settlement. We should make no announcement of policy ; but as each case arises, instead of protesting, remove the objectionable Turks. In the case of Koweit this would also, presumably, mean that we should support the Sheikh by force in the question of the registration of his Turkish properties, i.e., guarantee him against the conse quences of forcibly ejecting any persons whom the Turks might send to take possession of those properties. (4.) When the Turkish difficulty has been finally removed by one or other of these means, the main reason for concluding the agreements will have disappeared. It is for the Foreign Office to decide. 7th December 1910. F. A. H.[This Docmrrent is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government] PERSIA. [November 12.] confidential. Section' 2.

IN view of the insecurity of communication with Tehran, I am forwarding via London my report of this date to His Majesty s Minister on my recent proceedings at Mohammerah in connection with the delivery of the insignia of the K.C.I.E. and renewed assurances to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. I therefore have the honour simultaneously to submit a copy thereof direct to your address in order to avoid waste of time. I have, &amp;c. P. Z.

I HAVE the honour to report, for your information, the details of the action taken by me to give effect to the instructions conveyed in Foreign Office telegram No. 281 to your Excellency with reference to the delivery of the insignia of the K.C.I.E. and renewed assurances to the Sheikh of Mohammerah on behalf of His Majesty’s Government. For this purpose I arrived at Mohammerah on the afternoon of the 13th instant in His Majesty’s ship “ Redbreast. ’ cn m 1 i i .1 2. As regards the delivery of the insignia of a K.C.I.E. to Sheikh Khazai and the ceremony observed in connection therewith, I submit a copy of the report and accompaniments which I have addressed to the Secretary of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire, Calcutta, and trust that the details of my proceedings will have your Excellency’s approval. I may mention that, in order to give the Persian Foreign Office agent no excuse for telegraphing any misrepresentations to Tehran, 1 sent him immediately after the Durbar the record in Persian of the remarks addressed by me to the sheikh before presenting the decoration, and the sheikh took the same course 111 respect of his reply. 3. In the matter of the assurances I acted as follows : I took the unsigned drafts, in Persian and English, with me when visiting the sheikh on the 14th instant, accompanied by His Majesty’s consul, and read them to him and Haji Rais, and explained the terms of them. It was then arranged that 1 should date and deliver the completed documents to the sheikh after the Durbar, and I had them with me, but no suitable opportunity occurred for handing them over, and the sheikh asked me to keep them until he called on me to say good-bye before proceeding up the Karun on the 18th instant. They were accordingly made over to him on that occasion. , p a , , , ,, 13 ? +. The verbal explanation prescribed by His Majesty s Secretary of State to the ettect that the sheikh must understand that circumstances might conceivably arise in whic it would be impossible for us to intervene by force on his behalf, &amp;c., was duly delivered to him in the presence of His Majesty’s consul and Haji Rais. As I anticipated, this reservation did not disturb Sheikh Khazai in the least He replied that he quite understood it, adding that as long as he could feel assured that we really meant to safeguard him to the best of our ability m case of an emergency arising, it was sufficient for him ; and that that feeling our present assurances now enabled him to enjoy. 4. In this connection, however, he mentioned with ^ some hesitation and, aftei begging that he might be pardoned for speaking perfectly frankly, that, while he knew that he must have received cordial diplomatic support from us m connection with his [2968 m—2]2 I recent trouble with Yali Nazif Bey, yet he had felt rather left, at the time by my not arranging for one of His Majesty's ships to come up promptly when the Zain incident took place and there was a possibility of the vali following up his attack on his village bv action against Failiyah or Mohammerah. In reply to this, I assured him that Mr Wilson and I here, and the Foieign Offices m India and London, were vigilantly watching his interests ; that it was thought that the premature dispatch of a ship might only prejudice the amicable settlement which it was so important to arrange, but that a ship was all the time waiting, under orders to proceed at a moment s notice and would have come at once if our information from Bussorah or Constantinople had indicated that any further aggression was really likely. I had my dossier of the case with me and in order to convince the sheikh of the complete sincerity of our attitude, I turned to Sir Edward Grey s telegram of the 9th May to Sir Gerard Lowther (No. 97), and ventured to explain the g^t of it to the sheikh On realising how thorough and frank had been the attitude of His Majesty s Government in safeguarding him against further aggression, he was more than reassured, and again expressed his deep sense of obligation for our support. During the same interview he mentioned that the assurances as now given did not refer to the question of his customs or to our own probable attitude towards him in the event of the break-up of Persia. , , , w 1AQ ' These points were covered by items 5 and 6 of Foreign Office despatch No. 108, dated the 6th July, to Mr. Marling, and I disposed of them on the lines indicated by His Majesty’s Secretary of State in that communication. The sheikh did not press them, saying that he was now greatly reassured by what we had given him, and most grateful for the document now vouchsafed. , As regards his customs, he ultimately made a fresh proposal or offer which requires dealino- with separately on its merits. In fact, the whole question of the Mohammerah customs, by the light of eight years of the Belgian administration needs bringing up to date, and I have asked Lieutenant Wilson to draw up a memorandum on the subject, and submit it with the sheikh’s present proposal. „ . . 6 I should mention that on arrival at Mohammerah I found the Sheikh of Koweit m his launch, anchored at Failiyah alongside Sheikh Khazal’s palace It seemed to me that his presence at the presentation of the K.C.I.E. to Ynsftdus Achates might be t^ken advantage of to revive the former reports crediting the two sheikhs with sinister Arab ambitions, to which we lent secret encouragement. I therefore had a talk with Sheikh Mubarak, who readily fell in with my views (m which Sheikh Khazal inwardly concurred), and spent the day of the ceremony at Bussorah, with Ahmed Zuhair Fasha, returning the morning afterwards. ^ n r \ A 7 I am sending this communication with enclosures (of which I attach a list) via London, with a copy to His Majesty’s Foreign Office, and am also forwarding a copy to the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. P. Z. COX, Lieutenant-Coloyiel, British Resident in the Persian Gulf. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Consul-General Cox to Government of India. (Confidential.) October 23, 1910. IN continuation of my letter dated the 9th October, 1910, to 3' 0U i aadiess, I have the honour to acquaint you that the insignia of a Knight Commander o e Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire were duly delivered to Sheikh Khazai AJian, Sheikh of Mohammerah, in Durbar at his palace at Failiyah on the 15th instant, the ceremony being as follows :— 2. I proceeded from Bushire in His Majesty’s ship Bedbreast, placed at my disposal by the senior naval officer, arriving at Mohammerah on the afternoon o e 13tb October, soon after which I received a visit from Haji Bais at the consu a e. n the 14th, accompanied by His Majesty’s consul, I visited the sheikh to inform himo my mission, and to arrange the day and hour for the function and details of the ceremony to be observed. ,. , . m i* n • It was arranged that the presentation of the K.C.I.E. should take place the fo owing morning in Durbar at the Failiyah Palace at about 9 A.M., and the Persian toieign Office agent, the headmen of the sheikh’s various tribes, the European community, andvarious local officials and notables were invited by the sheikh, or summoned to be present.^ About 8 a.m. Lieutenant Wilson, His Majesty’s consul, and I went on board His Majestys ship “Redbreast,” lying at the anchorage at Mohammerah ; she then steamed up the river to Failiyah and anchored opposite the sheikh’s palace. On her arrival there Sheikh Chasib, the sheikh’s eldest son and heir, accompanied by Haji Rais, the sheikh’s chief adviser, came on board officially to welcome me on behalf of his father, and on leaving His Majesty’s ship, after a short interview, received for the first time the salute of five guns recently granted to him by the Government of India. It was arranged with Sheikh Chasib that as soon as all those expected had arrived and taken their seats a bugle should be sounded on shore, to let us know that they were ready for us to land. At about 9'30 a.m., the bugle having sounded, I landed, under my official salute, with His Majesty’s consul, and Lieutenant-Commander the Honourable R. O. Bridgeman, with three of his officers, was good enough to support us. His Excellency the Sheikh, with his sons and chief retainers, received my party at the landing steps and conducted us to the Durbar hall. For this purpose the fine verandah in front of the palace had been fitted up. The floor was carpeted with Persian rugs, and the Durbaris were arranged in two long rows of seats, with the sheikh on one side and I myself opposite to him at the top of the other. At the head of the avenue between the sheikh and myself Sheikh Chasib and his three picturesque little brothers were seated, Oriental fashion, on the carpet. If gossip and journalistic misrepresentation were to be avoided it appeared to me essential that the presentation of the insignia should be accompanied by some observations from me and a reply from the sheikh, and accordingly the terms of both had been discussed between ns the previous day. It was considered that, in order not to touch Persian susceptibilities, the vernacular used should be Persian ; and as the sheikh was shy of making formal remarks to an audience in that language it was arranged that our respective addresses should be read by my mirza and Haji Rais respectively, I delivering the. former in English for the edification of the European community. Copies of both, in English and Persian,are attached. Having concluded my observations, I stepped across the verandah and affixed the insignia on the sheikh’s robe. As I did so His Majesty’s ship “ Redbreast,” by prearranged signal, fired his Excellency’s salute of twelve guns, which was in due course returned from the shore. His acknowledgment having been recited, we resumed our seats, and held further conversation while bis Excellency’s band discoursed music and refreshments were served to the guests. The sheikh had now lost any shyness which he may have started with, and enlarged upon his great appreciation of the honour done him and his great obligations to His Majesty’s Government. After a quarter of an hour’s conversation I took leave and the Durbar broke up, the sheikh conducting me and my party to the landing stage, his band playing our National Anthem as we left. On our returning on board, His Majesty’s ship “Redbreast” steamed back to her anchorage at Mohammerah, and the proceedings thus terminated. I informed the sheikh that the sanad or grant of His Majesty the King conferring the dignity was on its way from London by mail, and would be delivered to him in due course. I have, &amp;c. P. Z.
