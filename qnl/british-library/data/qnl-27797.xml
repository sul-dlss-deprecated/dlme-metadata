Foreign Office. i r h fW Sir, ' J 12th March, 1929. With reference to your letter No.P 6951/E8 of the 15th February, relative to the proposed amendment to the Abyssinia Order-in-Gouncil, X am directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to request you to inform the Secretary of State for India that he considers that it would be advisable to introduce into the Abyssinia Order-in-Gouncil an article making it a punishable offence for any British subject to take any part (directly or indirectly) in any operation of war or hostilities in Abyssinia. 2. Subject, therefore, to any observations which Tiscount Peel may have to offer, Sir Austen Chamberlain proposes that the following article should be inserted between Articles 5 and 6 of the draft Abyssinia (Amendment) Order-in-Gouncil, a copy of which is enclosed for convenience of reference, fhe article will be numbered, temporarily, 5a. _ rt (l) If any British subject, without His Majesty’s 'authority, proof whereof shall be on the party accused, 'does any of the following things, that is to say:- '(a) Levies war or takes part in any operation of war 'or hostilities in Abyssinia or aids or abets any persons in 'carrying on war, insurrection, or rebellion against the 'Government of Abyssinia; or '(b) The Under-Secretary of State, India Office. bpy to Tn(l*&lt;i i ft 1929£500 £500 '(b) Takes part in any operation of war in the ’’service of the Government of Abyssinia against any ’’persons engaged in carrying on war, insurrection, or ’’rebellion against such Government; ”he shall be guilty of an offence against this Order, ’’and, on conviction thereof, shall be liable to imprison- ”ment, with or without hard labour, for any term not ’’exceeding two years, and with or without a fine not ’’exceeding five hundred pounds, or to a fine not exceeding ’’five hundred pounds without imprisonment. ”(2) In addition to any such punishment every 'conviction under the provisions of this article shall 'of itself, and without further proceedings, make the ’’person convicted liable to deportation, and the court 'may order him to be deported from Abyssinia in the ’’manner provided in Article 73 of the Principal Order. '(3) Where a person accused of an offence against 'this article is brought before a provincial court, that 'court shall report the case to the Court of the Consul- 'General, and the Court of the Consul-General shall 'thereupon direct in what manner and where the case shall 'be heard and determined, and the case shall be heard and 'determined accordingly.' 3. I am further to state that as Article 73(3) of the Principal Order is in the old and defective form. Sir Austen ( Chamberlain considers that it shoud be amended as follows: r Paragraph 3 of Article 73 of the Principal 'Order shall be amended by the addition of the words1 or if having given security fails during the ’continuance of the security to keep the peace ’or be of good behaviour,’ ’’after the words ’fails to do so 1 and before the words ’’’the ^ourt may order.’’’ 4.
