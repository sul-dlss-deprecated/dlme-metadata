Meanwhile we have to reply to paragraph 2 of New Delhi’s telegram NoJCl220. The position regarding ownership of the Meshed premises is set out in Government of India* s express letter of 16th June, 1947 (Flag A on old style file 29/118 attached). The land was bought and the buildings erected out of Indian Revenues; maintenance, equipment and staffing has been paid for in moieties by His Majesty’s Government and Government of India up to the transfer of power. The title deeds to the site are in the name of the British Consul General. At the time of the transfer of power the Government of India asked that His Majesty's Government should look after Indian and Pakistan interests until such time as the two dominions could establish their own consulates. The moieties system of payment has remained in force during that period. This case is in many ways similar to that of Kabul and Katmariki, and for that reason it seems to me that we cannot agree to the terms of the reservation which New Delhi propose in paragraph 2 of telegram No.X1220 whilst the Kabul and Katmandu position is still under consideration by the jLaw Officers. We may, in fact, have to change very considerably the line we have taken with the Government of India in the past. In that case it does not seem to me necessary to take quite the attitude proposed by New Delhi. The Meshed affair is not so serious as Kabul and Katmaribu in that there is no v question of one party's having the whole premises. We have indicated (telegram UKRI 498 of 26/7/47 - flag B) that ws should be prepared to divide the site, and the tone of Government of India's communication suggests that they accept this position. All we need to do, therefore, is to reserve our interest (and Pakistan's) in the ultimate financial settlement. On previous occasions when property has been handed over to the Government of India we have done this by merely stating that it was handed over without prejudice to the financial settlement; I suggest we should do the same again and have drafted a telegram accordingly. It does not seem to me that we can allow Pakistan to be excluded from the picture. The Government of Pakistan has laid a definite claim to the premises (enclosure to Slater's letter of 4th October, 1948 - flag C.),(see also my analysis of the stand-points to the two Governments dated 17 th May, 1949&gt; flag D), although Government of India do not accept this claim as valid. The Pakistanis will doubtless take a very poor view of it if they are left out particularly since their need of representation in Meshed is probably greater than that of the Government of India, Meshed being a place of Shiah Moslem pilgrimage. Welaiow that it is not possible to divide the existing premises into three portions and still provide adequate accommodation for all (paper 5 on this file), and since we are in possession and the Government of India have been first to formulate a definite claim it /lookslooks as though the Pakistanis will have to be the ones to find alternative accommodation.,which is available but only on a very modest scale* Doubtless New Delhi are right in saying that it is not necessary for us to remind the Government of India of Pakistan's interest* They know it well enough and the matter is purely one between the two Dominions* I feel sure, however, that one must not provide this accommodation for India without at least telling the Pakistanis about it in advance, and I have added a paragraph to my draft telegram fl s H p g Karachi to do this* If the Pakistanis do not re-act we ran go ahead with a clear conscience* If they re-act with sufficient force we shall be in a better position to tell the Government of India that we cannot provide accommodation until they have thrashed out y indirect negotiations with the Government of Pakistan , the latter* s claim to the premises. I have discussed the draft telegram with Moss of Foreign Office who agrees with it. Mr. Rumbold The present position about discussions between the United Kingdom, Indian and Pakistan Governments about the eventual disposal of Consular properties in Persia and the Persian Gulf^, is somewhat obscure, and indeed it seems that consultations on this ) i general issue have ground slowly to a standstill* We shall have to see what can be done about getting this moving and settled, but it would clearly be unwise to stir up the general issue until the Kabul and Katmandu problems are settled. X The background about the Persia and Persian Gulf Consulates is briefly that in July, 1947 the ' ) jq, ; Government of India told us which of these posts they and the Government of India expected to send representatives. (Government of India telegram No*5907-1600 on Coll.29/118). Regarding Meshed, they said that the Governments of India and Pakistan would wish to be represented separately. They would not, however, be able to open their offices immediately and would be grateful if the United Kingdom Government would/© would continue temporarily to look after both their interests using the existing staff and equipment. “S,About the same time (Cabinet Office telegram U.K.R.I. 498 of the 26th July, 1947 (on old style j[^ file 29/118)) the United Kingdom Government informed the Government of India of its views about the eventual disposal of individual Consulates. About Meshed, we said we would like to purchase the buildings and land and that we should be prepared to sell back portions to India and Pakistan or to divide the site by mutual agreement. H. On the 4th December, 1947 the Department of External Affairs in New Delhi discussed these problems with our High Commissioner’s Office (265 on 29/118). Our High Commissioner 1 s representative at that meeting said that he felt it would be necessary to ascertain the v/ishes of the Government of Pakistan before working out a solution about the Consulates,and he felt that a comprehensive over-all settlement between the three Governments concerned should be aimed at. It was agreed that properties not required by any of the three Governments should be sold and the proceeds held in a suspense account in Tehran. It was also agreed that the Government of Pakistan should at once be informed by the Govermuent of India of the broad details of all the properties d-niti-al, and of the wishes of the United Kingdom and Indian Governments in regard to each. The Government of Pakistan should at the same time be &gt; . J invited to make known their wishes also, 4n case they were interested in any property. At this meeting the Government of India representatives took the line that the disposal of all the properties -initia'i ■ was their concern alone, subject only to the proviso that due regard should be paid 'to the interests of both ’^bminions'. £*. Subsequently/^ Subsequently v;e received, through our High Commissioner in Pakistan, a copy of a communication from the Government of India to the Government of Pakistan, requesting 'that information may be # furnished to the Government of India regarding buildings in which the Government of Pakistan are interested. On receipt of this information, further steps will 4 be taken to arrive at a comprehensive over-all settlement'. (Above 6493 on 29/118). ..e later received^ also from our High Commissioner in lakistan^ a copy of the Pakistan Government’s reply, indicating that they were interested in the properties at Meshed, Zahidan and Khorramshahar, and stating that since more than one Government was interesting in acquiring these buildings, the disposal would be governed by paragraph 16 of the report of the Departmental Sub-Committee of External Affairs and Commonwealth Relations, i.e. in the case of Meshed^ in which all three governments are interested, by tripartite negotiations. &amp; ^There has since been references in correspondence on detailed aspectvof this subject to the possibility of tripartite negotiations to settle the financial problems arising in the disposal of these various properties,but no definite proposal to hold these discussions seems to have emerged, and ^meantime ^ the Government of India have taken their stand on clause 4(c) of the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liability) Order, and claim . that the disposal of these properties is for the Government of India alone to decide. y^The Indian Department of External Affairs have now written to our High Commissioner (6) asking for accommodation for an Indian Consul General and fairly large staff at Meshed by the middle of August. The/1 / -V*' v temporary lodging for the Indians at Meshed. Once they are in, however, it w^fl be difficult to get them out. The previous correspondence on this file shows that the properties at Meshed are likely to 0 be easily divisible into twQ, but not into three. I am, therefore, unhappy about the High Commissioner s suggestion that we should not remind the Government of India about the Pakistan Government's interest at this stage. Once we have provided accommodation for the Indians, it seems likely that we should have great difficulty in doing the same for the Pakistanis, and I dare say that the fact that the Government of India established their post at Meshed - stimulate the Pakistanis to do likewise. \o, I am, however, equally unhappy about Mr. Crook’s suggestion that we tell the Pakistanis what is going on without telling the Government of India that we The only sensible way of handling even the immediate problem, apart from the long-term settlement, is for the three governments concerned to get round a table, state what their plans are for their representation at Meshed in the near future, and work out a solution among them. I think the only way we can avoid being accused of bad faith from one side or the other, is to suggest to the Government of India that the Government of Pakistan Is^br^ngYbrought into this now. The Government of India may well try to brush this aside, but • even as temporary care-takers^faced with the immediate practical problem of providing lodgings for one or both of the other two governments, we are^I think, in a position to press it pretty firmlyP-OsN' ^'o +A&amp;1+ vo s^aVett^ «j/C\^ccV _ MR. Rt)l.BOIiD The action proposed in my preceding minute has been overtaken by the opinion given by the Law Officers of the Crown about the premises at Kabul and Katmandu ( 8 ) and the messages we have sent to the Governments of India and Pakistan as a result of that (Pol. V5A/2). In the meantime (a) Our High Commissioner's Office in New Delhi have sent an interim acknowledgment to the message contained in ( 6 ) from the Government of India. They have left the ?i/ay open, however, to make a reservation about the final settlement at Meshed (10). (b) We have been instructed by the China and South East Asia Committee (ll) to examine the legal position of the properties at Meshed, Bahrein and Muscat. (c) Our Ambassador at Tehran has been approached by the Indian Ambassador there (9). We have discussed in a preliminary way and I think you / / / agree that we ought at this stage to go thoroughly into the position in respect of all the properties in respect of which a final settlement is outstanding in Persia and the Persian Gulf, with a view to telling the Indians and the Rikistanis our views therefore, completing urgently his notes showing what information we tiave about each of the properties in question. We nope that this will be finished within a day or so and we can then consider sending it to the other Departments concemed, with our preliminary comments, with a view to eventual submission to the Legal Advisers. We ought, however, to send our High Commissioner an interim reply about Meshed. Our telegrams about Kabul and Katmandu will show him the way the wind is blowing on this subject and IMMIaK. we now ask him to tell the Indian authorities (a) that we are examining the legal position at Meshed, (we need not tell the PAjsN' •l/fUsccV _ /IndiansIndians at present that we hope to deal at the same time with the other properties in dispute); (b) that^without prejudice to the final settlement our Ambassador at Tehran is being instructed to discuss the matter with the Indian ^ Ambassador there with a view to doing something towards meeting the immediate needs of the Indians at Meshed# (c) that we feel the Bakistani’s should be brought in to this now, particularly as they also may want accommodation at Meshed in the near future. Of these 3 points (c) seems to me to present the greatest difficulties in presentation. We might suggest to the Indians that they take the initiative in bringing the fb.kistani's into the negotiations but that would perhaps than an announcement that v.e are approaching the Pakistanis. In the draft telegram^herewith I have, therefore, suggested the latter method. The draft sets out the background regarding Pakistan rather more fully than may be thought necessary. I have told the Foreign Office the lines iof our whi fl 1 ■ — I •Tuluarr; \’,Ve have delayed dealing with the G-ovfernment of India's telegram at Page 6 until decisions were taken by Ministers on the Kabul and Katmandu case. The Meshed Consulate General was, like the Kabul Bmbassy, paid for originally from Indian Revenues but after a certain date the cost of maintenance was shared by United Kingdom and Indian Revenues. Since this date considerable additions have been made to the buildings on the site, equal in value to the whole of the original buildings and United Kingdom Revenues have contributed fifty per cent of the cost of these additional buildings. It may therefore be that the legal position at Meshed is different from that at Kabul. However this may *be, it is clear that, whatever interest the Governor-General in Council may have had in the Meshed buildings, this interest is now shared equally between the Indian Union and Pakistan. 2, Consequently, until the legal position is clearer, we must I think proceed on the basis that the United Kingdom, India and Pakistan have equal rights in the Consulate General and that we cannot do for India at Meshed anything which we are not able to do, if necessary, for Pakistan^*, of course, for ourselves. The advice which we have received is that, while the site at Meshed could be divided into two, it could not be divided into three. It is inconceivable that the existing buildings could house three Consulate Generals and it is unlikely that they could house even two. On this basis it is unlikely to prove possible to give the Indians any temporary assistance at Meshed until the question of ownership is settled, because we can be certain that if we once allow the Indians to get into the Consulate General, we $ould never be able to get them out if this should prove necessary. Consequently, the discussions with the Indian Ambassador at Teheranjto which our Ambassador there hag incautiously committed himself^ are unlikely to have any result if our /AmbassadorAmbassador is given the instructions which the above analysis of the situation suggests to be necessary. 3. We know that Pakistan are anxious eventually to have a Consulate General at Meshed. negotiations with the to have any results^ a«d in them Indians only are we would be left the whole time holding the Pakistan baby. In order to avoid this situation and bring the matter to a head, I suggest that our rule regarding these diplomatic and consular buildings^ that } where we consider India and Pakistan to have equal rights, we should firmly resist any suggestion from India that we should discuss their fate with the Indians behind the back of Pakistan. This appears to have been the view taken by Ministers in considering the Kabul and Katmandu case. This decision appears to be highly unpalatable to Mr.Krishna Menon. It seems to me, however, that it would have been bfcgWy improper for us, having reached the conclusion tfiat Kabul and Katmandu buildings v&amp;ee jointly the concern of India and Pakistan, to have so informed India without also informing Pakistan. Anyhow, in the case of Meshed, I am sure that we ought to adopt the same procedure ^as wj? decided upon in the Kabul and Katmandu case and bring in Pakistan now. 4. Draft telegrams to New Delhi and Karachi and Teheran are accordingly submitted. They have the concurrence of the Foreign Office. 3.8.49. Ck/&gt; (^) the Pakistan authorities 'have also been informed' of our reply to the Indian request for accommodation at Meshed and 'they too will visit Meshed shortly to look for temporary accommodation outside'. It is not clear who told the Pakistanis what we had said to the Indians, There are a number of ways in which it might have leaked out, but the point is hardly worth speculation. The Pakistanis must previously have made up their minds to send someone to Meshed (perhaps on hearing that the Indians were going to do so) since our High Commissioner in Pakistan knew of the Pakistan Governments intention on the 5th of August (19) onlv one day after the despatch of our reply to India ( 16 ). 3- Our reply to the Pakistan Government*s approach obviously must be the same as our reply to India, I think there is everythinj to be said for getting off instructions to this effect urgently to our High Commissioner since (i) the Pakistanis know anyway what we have said to India and (ii) the High Commissioner for India had an interview yesterday evening with Mr .McNeil about Kabul and Katmandu. We do not yet know what he said but it would be as well for us to have replied to the Pakistan request before we can reasonably be held to have had time to have considered whatever Mr,Krishna Menon has said about our handling of the Kabul and Katmandu issue. There remains ^question of whether or not we should tell the Indian Government of the Pakistan request.) In view of paragraph 2 of (£1 ) I think it would be as well for our Higfe Commissioner to mention the Indian approach to the Pakistanis^ Our telegram at(l 6 ^^s deliberately drafted in such a way as not to make it clear to the Indians whether we were telling the Pakistanis about t h e ir approach. The Indians are bound to get to know Very soonqoJ? the Pakistan Government*s plans at Meshed, if they do not already know thenijand I think we should leave our High Commissioner free to mention the Pakistan request to the Indian authorities at an opportune moment. 5. I have discussed this with Mr.Moss of the Foreign Office who concurs in the views outlined above. 6 . Two drafts herewith, 4 1 , J S 6 - •T 8 . 49 . .OHr. Turnbull The latest news from the Foreign Office about the Note which Mr.Krishna Menon delivered to Mr.McNeil yesterday evening is that it contained a fairly stiongly worded request that we should withdraw the communication we made to the Government of Pakistan informing them that in our view the properties at Kabul and Katmandu were under the joint control of the Governments of India and Pakistan and that we should have the legal position on this point re-examined. 2. The iranediate necessity is to reply to Sir L.G.Smith's telegram at enclosure 22. Miss Emery's draft at A below may be approved. ^ ^ 3 . *1 do not think that we need to decide what we should say to the Government of India about the Pakistan request . for a share of the Meshed Consulate until we have had time to study Mr. Krishna Menon's Note. I therefore suggest that draft 'B* should be further considered after the week-end. -i ni© »ts \ 2-H-lo XK * ol h s Oy/^)juusoys ^ -/w- J-^L^, .

The Consulate-General at Meshed is one of the properties in Persia, the eventual ownership of which has still to be settled. The Governments of the United Kingdom, India and Pakistan are all interested in it. 2. At the beginning of July the Indian Government informed our High Commissioner that they proposed to open a Consulate- General at Meshed in August and asked that the necessaiy accommodation, both office and residential, and a certain amount of equipment,should be made available at the existing Consulate-General. The wording of the Indian Government's request implied that the premises and equipment were in fact the property of the Government of India. Shortly after receipt of that request, we received the Law Officers Opinion about ) the ownership of the premises at Kabul and Katmandu and in the light of that we sent the Indian Government the reply in the telegram at (l 6 ). .le have since begun examination of the position at Meshed (29/118A which I sent you separately today). 3* On the following day, our High Commissioner in Pakistan was informed by the Pakistan authorities that they also proposed to send a representative to Meshed in the near future and they folio ed that up a few days later with a request for accommodation in the existing Consulate ( 1 9 and 22). We sent the Pakistanis the same reply as we had given to the Indian Government ( 23 ). In doing so we told them that the Government of India had made a similar request and had been given the same reply. We had little choice in doing this because it appeared from telegram No,643 from Teheran (21) that they already knew. We did not, however, at the time/tell the Government of India of the Pakistan request (see Mr.Fowler's and Mr.Turnbull's minutes of 18th and 19th August). 4* Since then ; our High Commissioner's Office in New Delhi have been in touch with the Indian Consul-General elect at Meshed about his plans and we know that both he and the future Pakistan representative there are arranging for temporaxy accommodation outside the existing Consulate (24 and 23 ). I think there is much to be said for our informing the Indians without much further delay of what has passed between us and the Pakistanis. They are sure to learn sooner or later in Karachi, New Delhi, Teheran or Meshed and we do not want to give the impression .a#' that we are concealing anything. 5. Our High Commissioner in New Delhi will now have received a copy of the Indian High Commissioner's memorandum on Kabul and Katmandu (21 (A) on 14/84)and»from the telegram issuing today on that file^he will know at least our interim reply. I suggest therefore that we telegraph as in draft herewith which leaves our High Commissioner discretion to mention this matter to the Indians at an appropriate moment. The Foreign Office concur.fi L ft' we have about the Pakistanis (paper 25) shows that they have found a home outside the compound, and that only if the Government of India are given temporary accomnoda tion inside it will they ask for the same facilities. We have felt strongly that we could do nothing for the Indians without considering the Pakistanis interest. The converse is also true, however, and if Pakistan took advantage of India's postponement try trying to get in herself, we should have to hold her off# I think, therefore, that we should * say nothing to the Pakistanis (although they will doubtless hear about it from their own sources) of the Indian postpone ment, until such time as they raise the question again# Meantime we can be using the breathing space to complete our investigation into the legal position; the presentation of the legal opinion to the Indians and Pakistanis will depend on current form about Kabul and Katmandu.

Moreover on political grounds it seems unwise to live at too close quarters with any other consulate. We get on all rig}it with India and Pakistan now, but they may go in the wrong direction in years to come. 3. It would of course be possible to give up some of the outlying ground at the book, though one would regret it because the tennis courts and stables would be a great loss. But there seems to be no hurry about this, and while ownership is in the balance it is perhaps better not to raise the Question of any sale of land. In any case &gt; land values are rising as the town grows, and we are likely to gain rather than lose by waiting. 4. On all grounds, tradition, prestige and convenience, it is desirable to keep the present property ourselves. It has almost every advantage. It is ideal for entertaining and has become in a way the centre of the more liberal people in Meshed. t All the same, I suppose one has to face the possibility that inspite of your recommendations and the wishes of the foreign Office, it might be decided, possibly as part of a larger bargain, that we had to give the compound up to the Indians. 5. If this were so and if they could not be bought off by property « elsewhere or by a money settlement, then the only alternative, I think, would be to find a largish garden on the outskirts of Meshed in which we should have to build. In any case the setting up of a new consulate would take a long time, perhaps a year or two, and it would have to be done well if it were to be done at all. It is fairly safe to assume that nothing suitable will be found in the built-up part of the city. 6. All this is based on the assumption that we shall continue to have a consulate-general in eastern Persia. Indeed it seems unwise to leave so large an area on the Russian frontier uncovered. Bp ordinary standards the post does not justify a consulate-general as 90 per cent of the work is only administrative and clerical. But the influence which we still seem to possess in this part of Persia is based to some extent, I am afraid, on bluff, which means that we have to keep up a certain amount of brace. If the place is run shabbily the influence will disappear almost overnight. As it is, we have gone as far as we dare to satisfy the demand from home for economy. Even though tnere are virtually no British interests in this district, the post will normally be a good one for a senior officer who needs a rest cure or a quiet post before retirement, and indeed an agreeable personality is likely to be more useful here than a dynamic one. jrmvnrc* H.M's Ambassador, BRITISH EMBASSY, TEHRAN.COPY. : v OFFICE OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR INDIA, External Department, India House, Aldwych, Ref; EXT. 25.19.42. * London, W.C.2. 22nd September, 1949.

Zaiieer was most reasonable and clearly does not wish to force the pace, a 1though, of course, he may eventually have to do so. de ajreed that a final decision about the disposal of the Consulate buildings must depend upon the outcome of negotiations between our two Governments. He suggested that as an interim measure we m'.yht make available any surplus acconmoi .ation there might be in the Compound. I said that I would be n^ite ready to recommend some temporary measure of this kind but that such surplus accommodation as there was would not be comparable to that occupied by Consul-General and his staff f and I ha^C, therefore, not felt able to suggest it myself.

I said that it might be quite possible, but that it was clearly a matter which would hav e to be studied on the spot .• As regards moveable property, I explained to hr.

It was, however, agreed that we should ascertain within the next few days, exactly what would be available in the way oi/transport and office equipment elsewhere in Persia. The Ambassador did not for a moment suggest, as Hr. 3hasin f s letter had seemed to imply, that we should deprive ourselves or our Consul-General at Meshed of essential equipment in order to supply the new Indian Consul-General, and, needless to say, I did not encourage him to do so. I hope very much that a final decision will not be delayed much longer in regard to the Meshed property, and that it will be in our favour.

At the meeting at the /Indian-A. . K d-CuX. 4. affljssr moFsierifia at Kabul ahd KATiajax; The Committee considered a memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (SAC(49)ll) regarding the Indian CoTemment's claim on the H&amp;bassy properties and buildings at Kabul and Katmandu* THE FOREIGN S9CRSTARX said that the Prime Minister of India had strongly pressed a claim that the British Embassy properties at Kabul and Katmandu should be handed over to the Indian Government, and he had rejected an alternative offer of compensation. The Law Officers' advice, as set out in Appendix 'S' to 3.A.C. (4^(1, was that the United Kingdom could not successfully maintain title to either of these premises, and that their ownership was a matter to be decided between the Governments of India and Pakistan. In these circumstances, he suggested that messages should be sent to the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan informing them that the United Kingdom Government, after taking legal advice, had reached the conclusion that these premise! fall under paragraph 4(d) of the Indian Independence (Matas, Properties and Liabilities) Order, 1947&gt; and that they were therefore under the joint control of India and Pakistan; and suggesting that the two Governments should discuss the matter. There were two further points to which he attached special importance; firstly, he asked that the Ministry of Vorks should take very urgent steps to provide alternative aoaommoda- tion for H.M. Embassies at KVbul and Katmandu; secondly, he hoped that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would agree that the expenditure involved in the provision of alternative accommodation should be treated as part of the general financial settlement in connection with the transfer of power in India, and that it should not be made a charge on the normal Vote for the provision and maintenance of Embassy properties abroad. In discussion, the Committee were infomed that, on further investigation, it had been found that similar difficulties might arise over properties occupied by the British representa tives at Meshed, Bahrein and Muscat. It was agreed that it woulc be advisable to examine the legal position at these properties. The Committee Approved the recommendations made in S. A. C. (49)11 Cabinet Office, S.W.1— 3. In default of a reply, incidentally, to our telegram No.X1220 of the 5th July about the Lleshed Consulate General, we have been obliged to send an interim acknowledgment to the Government of India without any reservation in regard to the Indian claim to own the place. It is still however open to us to make a reservation on this point, and we still think that we ought to do so at a very early date. Pol.(Ext).7694/49 from R.VP.

Your reply might then go on to say that ^ on this understanding, and subject to any necessary/necessary financial adjustment later, we are examining urgently the possibilities of meeting the Government of India* s present reguest for accommodation and equipment at Meshed, and we shall let them know the results of this as soon as possible. 3. We are, however, not happy about your suggestion that we should not remind the Government of Pakistan* s interest. We have known since July, 1947 (Government of India Telegram No.5907 to the Secretary of State for India) that India and Pakistan would eventually wish to establish Consulates General at Meshed, and it seems to us that^ in view of Shiah Moslem pilgrimage, the Government of Pakistan* s need for representation at Meshed is possibly greater than that of the Government of India. At the meeting at the Indian Ministry of External Affairs on the 4th December, 1947, which Pry attended (Pry’s letter of 20th January, 1948, 48/CND/23), it was agreed that the Government of Pakistan should be asked by the Government of India to make known their wishes in respect of any Consular properties of this kind in which they were interested. We know from correspondence between the Government of India and the Government of Pakistan, which was conveyed to us through the United Kingdom High Commissioner, Pakistan (United Kingdom High Commissioner, Karachi, Despatch No.407 of the 10th July, 1948 and Slater’s letter to Selby of the 4th October, 1948), that the Government of India did make this approach and/(36291) Wt.46080/47 30,000 3/48 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd.

If they have, it would be well for the three governments concerned to settle among them what is the most practicable temporary arrangement. 5. -United Kingdom High Commissioner, Karachi, to whom this telegram is being repeated, should inform you immediately if he has any views about proposal in my immediately preceding paragraph.

[Copies sent to Telegram Section Commonwealth Relations Office for repetition saving to New Delhi and Karachi]. cccOF TKS LAW OgFICSKS OF THE CROWN !Ifre first question that arises in relation to the premises at Kabul is whether, within the meaning of Jection 172, sub section (1)(e) of the Government of India Act, 1935# they were immediately before the commencement of part III of that Act on the 1st April, 1947 'vested in His Majesty for the purposes of the government of India,' If they were, paragraph 4 of the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order 1947 made under Section 9 of the Indian Independence Act 1947 is applicable since the premises would Ccnstitute 'land*•••immediately before the appointed day.•••••vested in His Majesty for the purposes of the Governor General in Council' within the meaning of paragraph 4 of this Order, It would then fall to be decided whether the premises came within the purview of subparagraph (c) or subparagraph (d) of paragraph 4 of this Order, If sub- paragraph (c) is applicable the premises would be under the control of the Dominion of India, and if subparagraph (d) is applicable they would be under the joint control of the Dominions of India and Pakistan* The premises were acquired under an Agreement, which we have not seen, between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Afghan Government made under subparagraph (e) of the Second Schedule to the Treaty between the British and Afghan Governments signed at Kabul on November 22nd, 1921, and it would seem from the text of this Tfeaty that it may well have been considered by the Afghan Government that the premises were being acquired by or on behalf of the United Kingdom as such. As a fact, diplomatic representation in Afghanistan would serve not only the interests of the Indian Government but would also serve to protect United Kingdom interests, for example, against possible Russian aggression* Indian revenues, however, were used for the /purpose/ (3) purpose of acquiring the site and oonstrueting the building and under subsection 1 of Section 20 of the Government of luuia Act 1915, Indian revenues could be 'applied for the purposes of the Government of India alone.' It is in these circumstances that the question arises whether it can be said that the premises were vested in the Crown immediately before the 1st April 1937 otherwise than 'for the purposes of the government of India' within the meaning of Section 172(1 )(c) of the Government of India Act, 1935. Bie expression vested in His Majesty 'for the purposes of the Government of India' is used in Section 39 of the Government of India Act 1858, Government in that Section being spelt with a capital 'G* and in Sections 20 and 28 of the government of India Act 1915 the word government in those Sections being spelt with a small ’g*. whatever may be the significance, if any, to be attributed to the difference in the use of a small and large •g* in these Sections, we are satisfied that in Section 1?2(l)(c) of the Government of Aot 1935 the expression 'were vested in His Majesty for the purposes of the government of India' is used in the generic sense to describe the situation in which property is in fact owned by His Majesty for the purpose of conducting the operations incidental to the government and administration of the affairs of India, and we think that the test to be applied is a factual one which can be stated as follows rVas the land owned substantially for the purpose of governing India or not? IThe premises at Kabul, as stated, were in fact owned for the dual purpose of the government and protection of Indian interests and also for the protection of Uhited Kingdom interests. Die Indian interests, however, must, we think, be taken to have been the predominant reason for the (3) /use* / Mlto A _ - 3 - Use 0WIier *hip of the premises. We must, moreover, say clearly that, in any event, it would be extremely difficult, in face of Section 20 of the Government of India Act 1915, since Indian funds were used for the acquisition of the land and the construction of the buildings, to contend that the government of India was not the purpose or at least the main purpose to which the funds were applied and for which the property was acquired and vested in Plis Majesty. If the test which we have suggested is correct, it would be sufficient to bring the case within the scope of the words 'vested in His Majesty for the purposes of the government of India' in Section 172(1)(c) of the Government of India Act 1935 that the main purpose or at least a substantial purpose was the government of India even if there were also a further purpose which consisted in the protection of United Kingdom interests. In our view, therefore, the premises at Kabul were so vested in His Majesty and in consequence as a result of the Joint operation of Sections 172(l)(c) and 313(3) of the Government of India Act 1935, the premises fall within the description of land which immediately before the appointed day is vested in His Majesty for the purposes of the Governor General in Council* within the meaning of paragraph 4 of the Indian Independence (Hights, property and Liabilities) Order 1947. Ohe second question now arises whether subparagraph (c) or (d) of this order applies to this land. The fact was that immediately before the appointed day for the purposes of the Independence Act 1947, the Minister at Kabul was the representative not of the Indian Government but of the United Kingdom Government and we do not think that it could be said that within the meaning of subparagraph (c) the premises were, immediately before the appointed day, 'used for the purposes of /anyWiese aiyr official representative of the Government of India', words seem to us to contemplate use by some particular representative officially acting on behalf of the Government of India and we do not think they aptly describe the position of the United Kingdom Minister accredited to Afghanis tan. We accordingly think that subparagraph (o) would not be applicable and that, in consequence, subparagraph (d) must apply with the result that the premises must be regarded as under the Joint control of the necessarily entitle the Afghan Government to maintain that, within the meaning of subparagraph (e) oi the Second Schedule to the !Ereaty above referred to between the British and Afghan Governments, the finbassy has been 'permanently withdrawn' with the result that the Afghan Government are entitled to acquire the premises. It is a question of fact whether the Snbassy is permanently withdrawn or not and as we assume that the United Kingdom would desire to continue and is continuing its diplomatic representation in Afghanistan, presumably no such right of acquisition would arise. Biis question would, however, have to be the subject of negotiation between the Governments of India and Pakistan on the one side and the Afghan Government on the other if a claim is made by the Afr nan Government. ith regard to Katmandu, not dissimilar considerations are applicable, the main difference of faot being that the premises at Katmandu were acquired by a ft-ee gr^nt of land in 1816 to the British resident, India at that time being administered by the .^aat India Compary• This being so, the question arises whether within the meaning of Section 39 of the Government of India Act 1858 the premises could be said to constitute 'lands and hereditaments....which the said Company' (that is the Bast India Company) 'dhall be seised or possessed of or entitled to at the time of the commencement of this Act'. If they were within this /descriptiondescription the premises under Section 39 became vested in Her Majesty rt to be applied and disposed of ••••••••for the purposes of the Government of India*” If this were the case, the premises would, as in the case of those at Kabul, fall within paragraph 4 of the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order 1947# to which reference has already been made* It is, however, doubtful whether it could be said that immediately before the 1858 Act the Company was 'seised or possessed of or entitled to' the premises. The grant .was in form to the 'British resident” although the Treaty with Nepal of 1815 under Article 8 of which it was provided that accredited Ministers should be exchanged, was entered into between the East India Campany and the Rajah of Nepal. Article 8 however refers to accredited Ministers 'of the two States and we think that on the British side the State must have been the United Kingdom and cannot have been the East India Company* In our view, however, even if the grant was to the Crown, in law as well as in form, as we think was the case, the premises would, in any event, have been 'vested in His Majesty •••••••for the purposes of the government of India', within the meaning of Section 172(l)(c) of the Government of India Act 1935* On any view, therefore, we think that the premises at Katmandu fell within th ? scope of paragraph 4 of the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order 1947 that, as in the case of the premises at Kabul, the real question is whether subparagraph (c) or subparagraph (d) of paragraph 4 of the Order is applicable to them* In ifK A relations between the United Kingdom and Nepal were established on a regular diplomatic footing and the British representative was raised to the status of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary with credentials from His Majesty, The holder of the office, however, continued to be an officer of the Indian Political Service seconded for that purpose. He was authorised to correspond with the Government of India direct in matters exclusively concerning Nepal’s relations with India but in matters concerning Nepal's relations with others of KisTELEGRAM FOR DESPATCH — PRIORITY CLASSIFICATION Emergency Tor Secret- Immediate 'Secret Priority Confidential ^ Routine 'Restricted ^Deferred Oren ' « \ f - Herewith telegram No. .. fro m ....J..££.^_c^. to —£J2. : for repetition Sir a^ewe'tiijie cypher Message Control, r~ German Secticm, foreign Office.— Duty'Signal Officer* War Office Signal Office, Montagu House Annexe.

As Government of India must he well aware of the amount of accommodation available at Meshed, their request is tantamount to asking His Majesty s Government to vacate Consulate General as a whole. I asm me that your intention is still that His Majesty’s Consulate General should 'stay put' and that Government of India’s request will he resisted. 2, In my opinion the request contains an element of bluff since Government of India cannot seriously contemplate sending out so large a staff until they are assured that they can accommodate them, and they cannot expect His Majesty's Governnent will acinit^their claim without discussion. Moreover, they have still not opened their Consulate at Khoranshahar, although^ the Consul ms designated six nonths ago and the premises are available, and it is unlikely that they will be able to move much faster in the case of Meshed particularly as the Persian Government have not yet agreed to their opening a Consular Office at Meshed. (I learn confidentially thet request was only received by Ministry of Foreign affairs on July 12th). 3 If it is undesirable to return a complete negative reply I suggest that we offer to discuss through our respective Embassies an equitable division of the available accommodation and movables^ as regards accommodation see correspondence resting with Tehran \ letter 158/14/48 December 8th to Conference and Supp y Department.

The following is the text of a letter dated 2nd July from the Ministry of External Affairs. Begins* Kindly refer to paragraph 2(2) of telegram No. 590? dated 26th July, 1947 from the Governor-General (External Affairs and Commonwealth Relations Department) New Delhi to the Secretary of State for India London wherein the Government of India had agreed to His Majesty’s Consul-General Meshed using the existing Government of India buildings and equipment and looking after the Indian interests in Meshed till such time as arrangements were made by them to open a separate Office at that place# . 2. It has now been decided to open by about the middle of August, 1949 a Consulate*-General of India at Meshed and necessary accommodation for the Office and the staff have to be provided in the existing buildings belonging to the Government of India* It is therefore requested that His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed may please be issued necessary instructions to make available adequate accommodation for the Indian Consul-General and Staff. In addition to the Consul-General the staff would consist /ofof: Vice-Consul one, assistants three, stenographer one, clerks two, translator one, Gloss (IV), servants five, ^ tfe would be grateful to be informed as early as possible of the amount of accommodation made available and also to be furnished with a site plan of those buildings, 3* Che (Consulate—General of India* will also require furniture both for the Office and the residences of the Consul-General as well as his staff besides articles of office equipment such as (corrupt group), safes, typewriting machines etc. The Government of India would be grateful if these articles were made available from the old serviceable stock still hold in charge, 4.The Consulate-General will also need a staff car for the use of the Consul-General and -staff and a lorry or a station wagon. It would be very much appreciated if a suitable car and a lorry/station wagon still possessing a few years of economic life bould be made available either from the existing vehicles at Meshed or some nearby station subject to necessary financial adjustment later. Ends , 2# We feel that the Government of India’s claim to the Meshed * buildings belonging to them should not go unchallenged and we should accordingly like in our reply stating that the Government of India’s request is being referred to you to include the following reservation. Begins ♦ The views of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in regard to the manner in which the ultimate disposal of all these properties in Persia and the Persian Gulf should be settled are, we think, well enough known to the Government of India to make no further elaboration at this stage but we feel sure that pending a settlement of these internal issues and without prejudice to it the United Kingdom Government will do all they can to meet the wishes of the Government of India at Meshed, Ends , If you approveove -3- s of our making this general reservation we do not think it necessary and in the present circumstances would deem it wiser not to remind the Government of India that the Pakistan Government are also interested in a share of the Meshed building# 3# V/e must send an early acknowledgement to the Government of India 1 s letter. Please therefore indicate urgently whether you approve our proposed reservation referred to above# Our hesitation on this point arises from the fact that we do not know the extent s if any to which (?outstanding) point in regard to Persian and Persian Gulf buildings has been modified by the promised reconsideration of the issue of the Kabul and Kathmandu buildings. We told Bajpai incidentally that we expected to let him have our revised views on the latter issue jy the end of June#FOREIGN OFFICE, S. W. 1. (XA01/34K1 }k(b/kb)) ' O iJ T O it-:»axEu I34d i Dear Harrison, ^ 'With reference to your letter to Fisher dated the 1 3 th Nov ember, 1948, your reference: Pol EXT17383/46, apout the division of the property at Meshed, I enclose a copy of a letter from Ross at Tehran from which you will see that he agrees that it would not be possible to divide the property into three approximately equal parts to the satisfaction of the three Governments. The Consul General, however, is of opinion that it should not be difficult for India or Pakistan to secure office premises unless they want something on an elaoorate scale. It would seem, therefore, that the only solution to the difficulty is to divide the existing p roperty into two parts if agreement on those lines could be reached with the other interested parties and leave the third party either to lease premises or to build. It all seems to hinge upon the scale of offices which India and Pakistan will require. I am sending a copy of this letter to K.P. Leary at lie Ministry of Works*1\jU\ British Embassy Tehran 8th December, 1948. Would you please refer to Willson’s letter XA01 /34K/13A ( 6 / 48 ) of the 24th November about the Meshed property, I agree that it is not possible to divide the property into three approximate!}' equal parted at. the same time to preserve sufficient accommodation for our own Consulate, The only way round this statement that I can see is to assume that we will be prepared to demolish the existing Residence and offices and build in a corner of our plot; quod est absurdum. As regards alternative acoommodaticn there is no hope of finding anything like the existing property and I believe that the Americans have not yet found anything suitable for the Consulate which they h~pe to obtain the Persian Government’s permission to open. No dcubt they could eventually buy land and build, Cpstrell, however, says that it should not be difficult for India or Pakistan to find decent premises for an office on a modest scale, i.e. small but comfortable buildings and a bit of garden. Much dejjends on how big a #how the Dominions w»nt to put up. /As regards J.M.

I enclose photographs of a plan of the Meshed Consulate- General. The plan is based on an old drawing dated 1898 but brought up to date. In our view the property can be divided and the most con venient division is shown by the dotted line which cuts it roughly in half across the width. The staff of our own Consulate-General will in all probab ility be the same size as it is now, viz. Consul-General, Vice-Consul, Assistant to Consul-General, Clei$ Accountant, plus possibly a dozen menials. I hardly think we can ask the Indians and Pakistanis how large their respective establishments will be, but we guess that they will be roughly the same size as our own. The two Ddninions might in face - have to sub-divide their half of the property, though this is probably not a subject which they would discuss with us. In fact would not India take the line that she could do what she liked with her own half? As regards tacticsj, I assume that you will stand out for our keeping the whole of the property. Our claim would be based on the fact that we 'were the pother ountry and that the (Jonsulate-i reneral was after all the British Consulat -General; and even if the site and original buildings were paid for out of Indian revenues, the cost of the very considerable additions and improvements since 1901 has been shared in moieties. If, however, the state ol the negotiations on former Government of India property as a whole call for sane ^concession Iran our side, then at the aporopriate moment you could of^er to divide the oroperty. In this event, it is of paramount importance that we should have the part which lies to the west of the dividing line, with^the exist inn- residence and the frontage on Pahlevi Avenue. Our claim to. this better hal&lt;f would be supported by the same arguments as our claim to the whole property. It could also be represented that, apart from the question of frontage, the 'worse' half offers excellent scope for development if the Indians want to do themselves well in Meshed. Of course, we do not necessarily mean keeping the whole property ard if by any chance the Indians were to concede the whole of it we could eventually sell the 'worse' hal^ and put the proceeds in the suspense a/ot J . uyours ever, J.M.Pishar, Esq., (SGD:) A.D.M.ROSS.On His Majesty’s Service■ — — '</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00010b_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3705</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00010b</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3705</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 29/118(6) 'Meshed: allocation of British Consulate-General'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1948/1949</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-10-11T22:20:25</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (92 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.
