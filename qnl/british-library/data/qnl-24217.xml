Enclosed herewith is a copy of the Trucial Coasts programme of requirements from the United Kingdom in 1946 as recommended by me to the Government of India. 3. Please note that the Trucial Coast's require ments have been shown as re-exports from Bahrain. This was done as it was thought that shipping facil.i ties direct to Bahrain would be more readily available than if the goods were shipped direct to Dubai/ Sharjah. Please consult the merchants and let me know whether they accept this method or would prefer that I ask for goods to be shipped direct to the Trucial Coast with the consequent risk that shipments may be few and far between. 4. If shipments are required to be made via Bahrain a re-export duty will probably be payable to the Bahrain Government and this is a question which I would then have to take up with the Bahrain Government. 5. No further action regarding placing of orders etc, is required by you as yet and I will give you full instructions as to procedure etc. as soon as the programme is approved. 6 . Please let me know the result of your discussion with the merchants as soon as possible. KMS for POLITICAL AGENT, BAHRAIN.NO.787.1230 ;'i CD t British agency, gharjah. Da God the 17th July 1945.
