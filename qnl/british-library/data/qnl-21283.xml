Sir I have the honour to point out thac in your Memorandum No. 73-12 dated the 9th of February, 1944, you initiated the case for the sale of Area 'C of h the Muharraq aerodrome to the Royal Air Force, In ^ your letter No. 967-31 dated the 10th May, 1945, the price of the land was quoted and the natural assumption therafrom - an assumption on which the case proceeded t &lt;• from the beginning - was that the Bahrain Government r b~ were willing to sell the land. .To write, therefore, that your letter No. 974-31 dated the l^th May, 1946, (informing me that Jiis Highness Shaikh Salman does not wiah to sell) oame as a surprise, would be a master piece of under-statement. 1 am unable to find any suggestion throughout my record that there was ever any question of His Highness' unwillingness to sell. Had there been any i should have expected it to be pointed out in reply zo my predecessor's letter No. c/345 dated the 10th of March in which he intimated to you that it had been decided to purchase the land. 2. The only suggestion I am able to make is that His Highness should be requested to revise the decision regarding the sale communicated in your letter No. 974-31 of the 12th May, 1945. I should be grateful if this could be done forthwith and the result intimated to me. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant.

Sir, I have the honour to advise you that it is necessary for me t o complete my records of Air Ministry purchased and leased land comprising the Royal Air Force Station, Bahrein* 2. Enclosed herewith is a Drawing N o .BAK /109, with schedule referenced by \cey numbers, showing all land at present known to be owned or leased by the Air Ministry. 3. I would be extremely grateful if you could obtain for me from the Bahrein Government Lands Department a copy of the title deed with plan, in respect of area numbered 8, and a copy of the agreement, with plan, in respect of area numbered 9. 4» For your information,Drawing No.BAH/109 is not now strictly accurate in relation to the actual land occupied* However, it is hoped, when more surveying staff becomes available to have the boundaries of the station properly surveyed® When this has been done it is proposed that we should make application to the Adviser to the Government of Bahrein for permission to purchase or lease any additional land not covered by the existing deeds and leases. 5. It is thought possible that the Bahrein Government Land Department may have made recent surveys of Muharraq Island, in which case, a 1/2D00 scale plan shoving the boundaries of the airfield in relation to the adjoining lands would also be of considerable assistance. I have the honour to be. Sir, zierc Your OD e di ent Servant, ( ARGH. G. GDUAN ) Group 3 apt ain. GHUP R. ?. AH;. IRA 1 .I mentioned to you that I had received a letter from the Royal Air Force about completing their records of Air Ministry land purchased or leased In Bahrain. 2. We agreed, I think, that you would arrange for a title deed to be drawn up covering the land presented to the Royal Air Force by His Highness, known In our files and correspondence as Plot •C*. 3. I have also been asked If the Bahrain Government Land Department have made a recent survey of Muharraq Island, In which case Air Headquarters would be grateful for a 1/2600 scale plan showing the boundaries of the airfield in relation to the adjoining lands. If this could be supplied. It might hasten the R.A.F. survey of the boundaries of the station,which has been hanging fire so long,and the Inclusion In such a plan of the pumping stations and other external buildings would enable me to point out the delay there has been In this matter.

The principle correspondents in the file are the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, and the Political Agent in Bahrain during 1945, Cornelius James Pelly.Belgrave’s original proposal for the Bahrain Government to sell or lease the land in question (marked as plot C on Belgrave’s hand-drawn map, folio 3) was met favourably by the British Government. Plans for the acquisition proceeded, until it became clear that Shaikh Salmān bin Ḥamad Āl Khalīfah did not want to sell or lease the land (folio 7), causing some confusion before Shaikh Salmān eventually opted to make a gift the land to the RAF A map of the area, showing RAF property, land leased for civil aviation purposes, and the new plot of land gifted to the RAF by Shaikh Salmān, is on folio 17. Five years after the transfer, officials at Air Headquarters requested copies of the title deeds of the land from the Political Agent. Their request is enclosed in the file, accompanied by a map of Muharraq (folio 15) showing the plots of land owned by the RAF and civilian air authorities. A key to the map (folio 13) is also included.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>RAF Muharraq, British airbase</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003e5#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
