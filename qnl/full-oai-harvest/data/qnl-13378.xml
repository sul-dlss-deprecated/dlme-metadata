The prints are firmly mounted on embrittled card pages, which are disintegrating at the edges. Each print is captioned in ink and dates from 1903.The album is one of two forming the ‘Dane Collection’, which was presented in 1946 by Miss Dane, daughter of Sir Louis William Dane (1856–1946), Foreign Secretary to the Government of India at the time of Curzon’s tour. The front endpaper bears the signature ‘Louis Dane’ and a title page elaborately inscribed as above.There is a strong likelihood that the photographs in the album were taken by Raja Deen Dayal &amp; Sons (Lala Deen Dayal), since John Lorimer (1870–1914) cites him as photographer of Photo 49/1/20, reproduced in his 1908
                           Gazeteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia,a work which drew on information gathered during Curzon’s 1903 tour. Deen Dayal had been appointed as the official photographer to the Viceroy of India in 1885.Elements:1) Lord and Lady Curzon and staff on the tour [of the Persian Gulf]2) R.I.M.S.
