Now that the question of the payment of rent for the Royal Air Force petrol barge has been settled, it appears a suitable time to take more active steps with regard to the Shaikh's refusal to call on either Political Officers or H.M.

Even if, in fact, there is no foundation for this, it would appear desirable to clarity the position from both these points of view. 20. The Shaikh’s refusal to call is known and is commented on, to our disadvantage, on the Trucial Coast.(•5011—2534) Wt. 19874—958 15,000 10/33 T A.M. Form 683. INDEXED SECRET.
