Is it acceptable 0 Yur Honour t to say that the Islands which are considered the completing part of the Qatar State on the north side, delong to Bahrain ^tate and not to the State of %atar ? It is Known to Your Honour that the Hawar Islands belonged to the ^tar State from the very day when God created them and have remained Qatar territory up this day; that they do not Delong to Bahrain according to their natural and geographical position; that ne ither they/were detached from their mother &lt;*atar, nor did they cut off themseves from her; and the Government of Bahrain neither conq.uered nor invaded them except in recent times when they found circumstances to he favourable and trans gressed on the Islands with a view to usurping them under a * false claim which is contrary to all facts and principles. /I was2 fgj I was atle to prevent them from doing this transgression at the time &gt; hut I resorted to common sense and relying upon the friendship of His Majesty^s Government and their support in rightful questions , and with this belief, submitted my protest and complaint to the proper quarters on this subject* With my full deference ana honour for His Majesty*s Government and consideration for Your Honour,! beg to state that it strikes my mind that the true position of this question has not become fullyiplear to tv&gt; His Majesty's Government or to Your Honour and so the case has not become clear.. However much I thought over this J c^-xaJL ^ lL a matter, the thought has qu twftfthat the sophistications to which the Government of Bahrain have have resorted and which they^shown to Your Honour in a polished gilded appfcarnace, might have been the factor for-the formation of His Majesty's Government's viewpoint tfn this question. And having regard to this probability,! am unable to remain quiet over the case ; which preferaoly is the result of abstruseness, ambiguity, and non-eiuciuation of the relevant xacts* I therefore protest lor a seconu. time asking for the clarification of the question, ana appeal to Your Honour's humanity and to His Majesty's Government's sense of justice to look into the case with due justice that and equity as I am perfectly conf tdent A Ki3 Majesty's Government's and Your Honour's sense of justice and humanity would not agree that any transgression should oe made on my territory or acy natural rights. I am positive that on the clarification of the facts of the case you w^uld change your opinion for respecting my rights and nation's and avoid wounding mine and my nation's hearts seeing that we are such of your friends who have remained your friends up to now and depend upon your assistance and support. /! requestI request that the question may ££ considered a^ain and that enquiries may a^ain he made into it, because, as you will appreciate C Your Honour \ one cannot surrender to the usurpation of one *s land or one's rights, and that neither justice, nor the dhara law, nor any Civil Law, does sanction any usurpation* I therefore reserve for myself my rights to the Hawar Islands until the true position has become clear.

There is no objection here to the Company undertaking explor ation work at once in the area. The Bahrain Government would be jl glad to see this work begin, and I would request that a telegram be , sent to H.M T s Secretary of State for India accordingly. From our own point of view there is much advantage in expediting the explor ation of possible oil-bearing areas to reinforce the existing Bahrain field^since my information is that experimental production over a daily average of 20,000 barrels is resulting in an alarming influx of water. Would it now be possible to accelerate the final settlement of concessional terms and of the political agreement ? There can be no doubt of the political advantage of a rapid settlement now. So far/2 ( 2 * iar as I am aware no objections have been raised by any Department of His Majesty*s Government to the terms of the lease, and the only serious obstacle to a final settlement is the question of the pre-emption schedule in the political agreement. I venture to suggest that this need cause no delay. The Bahrain, London and Hew York offices of the Company all recognise clearly that the British Government can and will take any action they choose in respect of Bahrain crude and Refinery output. Legally no difficulties exist. Bahrain, it has been held, is legally at war (by virtue of its Treaties) in any war in which Great Britain is involved. The Bahrain Petroleum Company, whatever the nationality of its Parent Companys, is a registered British Company. under 7 vus-'ky- h the terms of the Persian Gulf btates Emergency Order in Council Jr* &gt; fas ( any of the Defence Regulations 1939 applicable in Great Britain can equally be applied in Bahrain, and a local Regulation based on (Great Britain) Regulation 55 provides all powers necessary. The operation of such powers provides the Company with the cover for their T, force majeure” clauses in sales contracts. 4. In such circumstances it would seem possible to side track any question of a pre-emption agreement and to assure the maximum political benefit (in our relations not only with the Shaikh of Bahrain but also with the Company) derivable from an immediate settlement. Such action would ecually assure our control ol Saudi crude oil once it has been imported into Bahrain lor refining, since this oil is purchased by the Bahrain Company from the California Arabia Standard Oil Company, and is therefore, in Bahrain, subject to the operation of a Defence Regulation.INDIA OFFFICE POLITICAL D EPARTMENT. &amp; EXPRESS LETTER (AIR MAIL) From To Repeated Dated No. Secretary of State.

I understand that this Company now desire to have permission to proceed with geophysical and otner preliminary field wort: in Bahrain because the time is rapidly approaching when the Company must arrange the parties who are to go uo Bahrain to undertake this worki the locality makes iu desirable that the work, if it is to be done at all tnis coming year? should be commenced as early in tne Auoumn ^.s possible. The Sheikh of Bahrain has been rather insistent that the Company should proceed with exploration work and also do some test drilling without losing time, and he has received assurances in that connection. Of course, anything which the Company might do prior to the signing and delivering of the two Agreements, thau is the Political Agreement and the Supplemental Lease? would be at the risk of the Bahrein Petroleum Company in all things; furthermore, it would be distinctly understood by the Baxirein Petroleum Company that permission to proceed before one documents were concluded would not hamper either the British Government or the Government of Bahrein in che proceedings now on foot between those Governments and one Company - in other words, the two documents vould proceed to a conclusion in the normal fashion according to the arrangements ultimately come to between the British Government and the Bahrein Petroleum Company without regard2 . to the fact that the Bahrein Petroleum Company were engaged in this preliminary work.

(E 4891/196/91) 'Y&gt; Dear Peel Many thanks for your letter P.Z.4023/33 of the 6 th July, regarding the draft concession for the Bahrein Unallotted Area and the relevant draft political agreement. we accept the views expressed ill your comments on Mr. Ballantyne*s notes. I personally do not feel that the point about the pre-emption clause is of outstanding importance. As the Company themselves seem to recognise, v/e should, in the event of an emergency, presumably do whatever we thought necessary, and the Company, whatever iws nationality, would have to accept our action as forc e me .1 cure . 3. As regards Mr. Ballantyne f s suggestion about the area of the concession, we feel that he is probably confusing (1) the question of the extent of territorial waters with (2) the question of the acquisition of rights over the sea-bed outside territorial waters. 4. Mr. Ballantyne is quite right in saying that the Sheikh of Bahrein has sovereignty over all waters within 3 nautical miles from low-water mark of any islands over which he can properly claim sovereignty, unless, of course, land belonging to any other Power lies within 6 miles of a Bahrein island, in which case the boundary of territorial waters should divide the distance equally. 5. V/e do not, however, think that the further proposition could be sustained that, if the Company were to erect derricks in shallow waters, these derricks would each constitute a new island, so to speak, from which r* new 2 . x do not think we have any comments to make on the new draft concession. As regards the political agreement, area/2 . area of 3 miles could do claimed as Bahrein territorial waters. Such claims have been put forward unsuccessfully in the past for light-houses and anchored light-ships. 6 . Nor can we accept Hr. Bsllantyne s xurtner contention that the whole of the area of the gulf outside the territorial waters of Qatar and Saudi Arabia could oo claimed for Bahrein. This gulf is not bounded by the territory of a single State and the special rule about landlocked bays surrounded by the territories of a single State would not therefore apply here even if the gul.. ueri - indeed, such a 'bay which seems doubtful* 7, The position with regard to the acquisition Ox rights over the sea-bed was? zs you will remember, set in Beckett’s minuted SflfeS Kril 1956, a copy of which was sent to Gibson under cover of Brenan’s letter E2288/413/91 of the 25th April* It is recognised by his Majesty's Government that the bed of the sea and the land under it is capable of acquisition by occupation beyond the 3-mile limit. The Company would therefore be sole to appropriate the sea—bed outside territorial 'waters oy effective occupation, and, as and when they diu so, tho sovereignty would presumably vest in the Sheikh o^ Bahiein though it might be advisable for the Bahrein Government to make some further overt act claiming such sovereignty* I am sending copies of this letter to Jarrett and Starling.

After compliments, I have received your letter No. C/476 dated 25th September 1939 (13th Sha*aban 1358) contents of which I have noted. You have pointed out that the information communicated fix / ■? X- *• to me, about Hawar Islands, in your predecessors letter No. C/639 dated 11th July 1939 (23rd Jamad- al- Awwal 1358) was a final decision and the matter connot be opened afresh. Am I to understand from your Honours remark that all what I wrote and explained have not received your attention, and that my request to you to think about gleaning the facts and weighing t:rem with the measure of realities has not evoked the least of your interest ? I hold your Honour in higher estimation than to think that you take an easy view of the stripping off of a part of my land with out my knowing the grounds on which His Majesty's Government based their views in giving the decision which you have mentioned as being final. Whatever may happen my belief in the Justice of His Majesty's Government remains unshaken and I believe that the points of this matter have not fully become clear, and that the beguiles to which the Bahrain Government have resorted made the matter so ambiguous. Therefore it is impossible for me to keep quiet and to submit in such a matter. I shall continue the clari fication of my case in a clearer and more argumentative statement and I am fully confident that His Majesty's Government will neither recognise nor agree to the encroachment upon even one of my rights, and the cutting off of a part of my territory as I cannot perceive that His Majesty's Government would forcibly take the rights of one to give to the other because of my knowledge of their honourable attitude in all matters. j therefore beg to inform your Honour that I neither recognise nor submit that the Bahrain Government have the least lawful connection with the Hawar Islands, and that I view whatever measures which have been lately taken by the Bahrain/-Bahrain Government as a challenge and an encroachment upon my rights against which I most strongly protest, and therefore, as I have informed you before, I reserve my rights to the Hawar Islands while not recognising any measure which may be taken in them, and I am sure that His Majesty’s Government will not agree to the wounding of my heart and of the hearts of my people while we are their loyal friends. I am unshakeably confident that His Majesty’s Government will think about the matter and will review it in a clearer manner than hitherto. Usual ending.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. Department.

W.t-lif. ilfOUnogllTML RECORai' u Keference correspondence resting with India Office telegram No. 2842 dated the 11th November 1939 in regard to the Bahrain Un allotted Area. 2. I forvsard herewith a copy of a letter No. 1931 dated the 27th November 1939 w r hich I have received, with feelings of some discomfort, from the Adviser to His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain. I do not consider the request made in this letter at all suitable for a State in the position of Bahrain which, even if its investments for a Reserve Fund are delayed, is far from being in such a conditior of penury that it urgently requires the sum of 4 lakhs due on signing the agreement for the Unallotted Area. On the other hand it is only too easy to appreciate the sentiments implicit in the sentence : n His Highness understands that the delay is not due to any of the conditions in the agreement between himself and the Company but is owing to matters that are being dealt with between the British Government and the Company.* 3. Although there is not the least doubt that I could obtain the ready consent of the Company to pay over the sum of Rs. 4 lakhs under the conditions stated in the Adviser’s letter, I consider it highly /- S. 14. {Designation)- 2 - highly undesirable to do so since such action would carry the implication that there could be no expectation of His Majesty*s Government comnunicating their final decision for many months to come. In my opinion it should, on the con trary, be assumed that a decision will not be much longer delayed; for presumably the Petroleum Department gave con sideration before the outbreak of war to the points raised in iry Express lett . ted the 10th June 1939 relating to the terms of the draft concession, and all that remains now is for the Admiralty and the Petroleum Department to state their views on the subject of the Political Agreement. I would suggest that for the reasons stated in my Express letter No. C/532 dated the 10th September 1939 the question of the Political Agree ment raises no serious problem; and I recommend once more that His Majesty*s Government be invited to com municate their final decision with the least possible delay. 4. I need only add that the relationship between the sum of £30,000 presented by His Highness to the British Government for war purposes and the lump sum payment of as 4 lakhs due on the signature of the con cession is sufficiently apparent.

To His Brittanic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad has requested me to communicate with you on the subject of the oil concession over the additional area which he has granted to the Bahrain Petroleum Company. 2. The negotiations between His Highness’s Govern ment and the Company were completed about six months ago and since then His Highness has given permission to the Company to make certain examinations of the sea bed in the waters around Bahrain. His Highness has also permitted the Company’s geologists to visit various islands within the Additional area. 3. His Highness understands that the delay is not due to any of the conditions in the agreement between him self and the Company but is owing to matters which are being dealt with between the British Government and the Company. His Highness wishes me to enquire whether it could be suggested that the Company should pay the Rs 400,000/- which is due on signing the agreement with the condition that should the agreement not be signed the money would be refun ded by the Bahrain Government to the Company. 4. His Highness is somewhat reluctant to mention that when he presented the sum of £30,000. to the British govern ment he had assumed that the payment of four lakhs would be/-be made shortly. This and the cost of reserve food supplies for Bahrain has so reduced the Governments funds that it has not been possible to increase the H eserve Fund during the second half of the year. If the Company could pay the four lakhs now, it would be greatly appreciated by His Highness Shaikh Hamad. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd. C.Dalrymple Belgrave.

As regards the second letter of the 30th May dealing with the political agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Company, which follows in its general lines the political agreements in other neighbouring territories, My Lords concur in the addition to clause 8 to provide for the use by His Majesty's Government of harbours and harbour facilities developed by the Company, and as regards clause 6 (channels of communication between the Company and the Bahrein Government) are prepared to agree to any arrangements that meet local convenience and permit of adequate British control. They also concur in the proposal that Article 11 should provide only for the termination of the concession agreement by the oheikh for an; breach of the political agreement and should not provide for confiscation of property. 3. As regards the question o** the sea area of the Bahrein State, My Lords agree with the Foreign Office view that - (1) Sovereignty extends over all waters within three nautical miles from low water mark of any of the Bahrein islands, unless land belonging to any other power lies within six miles, in which case the boundary of territorial waters divides the distance equally. (2) Company's derricks erected in shallow water would not constitute a new island from which a new area of three miles width could be claimed as territorial waters. (3) The area of the Gulf, outside the territorial waters of i star and jaudi Arabia cannot be claimed as Bahrein territorial waters. (4) The bed of the sea and the land under it is however capable of acquisition by occupation beyond the three mile limit. Subject in (4) however, to the addition that such acquisition by occupation must not affect the use by all countries of the water over such portions of the bed of the sea or the land under it.

WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 14th Fehruary, 1940* Dear Jarrett, 1 ’Would you please refer to Admiralty letter of the 31st January, No.M.06401/33, about the Bahrein unallotted area agreements. You will also have seen Ravenshear's letter of the 11th January ( P.D.21/12/1) and Baggallay t s letter of the 26th August (E 4891/196/91) on the same subject« 2. The correspondence shov/s that the Foreign Office and Petroleum Department do not attach the same importance as do the Admiralty to the retention of the pre-emption clause and schedule in the draft political agreement. Our feeling is that the Company's objection to the pre-emption provisions have some substance, and that it v/ould be more satisfactory I to avoid using the heavy hand with them if we can resort to a compromise which, while acceptable to them, will secure us all we want. We do not think that the hypothesis in the penultimate sentence of the fourth paragraph of the Admiralty can be accepted, as we are advised that if a pre-emption . * clause is inserted in the political agreement the effect is that anything done by virtue of the rights and obligations created thereunder cannot be attributed to 'force majeure'. We could therefore only take the line with the Company that the pre-emption provisions must be included just as they have been included in agreements with many other Companies. 1 6 . We think however that, following the suggestion in paragraph 2 (e) of Ravenshear's letter, a satisfactory compromise is possible. We would propose, (a), to substitute for/ •Jarrett, Esq., Admiralty, S.W.l.'for the existing pre-emption provisions a clause and schedule : on the lines of the enclosed draft, and (h), to arrange hy an exchange of letters, as a condition of Eis Majesty’s Government’s approval of the concession, that the Sheikh gives an undertaking to carry out the v/ishes of His Majesty’s Government if the latter, in the event of a state of national emergency or war (of the existence of either of which ills Majesty’s Government would he the sole judge) should advise him to take over on their 'behalf the Company’s products and production arrangements. We think this course would fully secure the advantage referred to in the fourth paragraph of the Admiralty letter, while we have no reason to suppose it would he unacceptable to the Company or to the Sheikh. The Company have raised no objection to His Majesty’s Government- acting hy ’’force majeure” rather than hy virtue of a pre-emption agreement, and we are advised that, hy agreeing to provisions as in the enclosed draft, they would not he prejudiced in pleading ’’force majeure” in defence of a breach of contract. As for proposal (h), we do not anticipate any objection on the Sheikh’s part, inasmuch as no more is asked of him in effect than if he were asked to take cognisance of a political agreement containing pre-emption provisions. 4. We hope that you will agree with the above suggestion and we should he grateful if you could let us know, as early as you possibly can, whether the Admiralty are willing to forgo in favour of it, the view taken in their official letter. In other respects we are now ready to communicate His Majesty’s Government’s views to the Company, and are anxious to avoid any further delay. 5. I am sending a copy of this letter to Eyros and to Havenshear, who will no doubt lot us know if they see any objection to the terms of the enclosed draft. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) ft.

As regards the Concession A&amp;ree ent i- (a ; We have examined the draft, both as emended by your Department and in the most recent version which has been largely agreed with the Gheikh. (b) We agree with the present formula for the description of the area, namely the 'Gheikh’s present and future dominions”. (c) dutject to (e; and (f; below, we have no observations on Fowle's and Weightman’s comments (see i . Z.4124/39). (d; As regards Article 4 it is customary in Oil Concessions to give the concessionaire the exclusive right to prospect for and win petroleum but the non-exclusive right to sell fluci trans port petroleum. As the * ‘tide is worded at present it gives the Company, under 4(a), the exclusive right (inter alia, to transport petroleum, qu lifted by the proviso under 4 (c&gt;, which says that the rights granted by either sub-clssaes (a; or (b&gt; of the Article shall not Include the exclusive right to sell petroleum products within the sheikh’s present and future dominions. his has probably originated from Article I of the lease dated 29th December, 1934, tne terms of which appear to be somewhat inconsistent especially as regards the operation of refineries. We therefore think that in order to make it quite clear that the Company shall not have a complete monopoly of marketing oil within tne heikh’a present and future dominions (which would, we think, be iruplicit In an exclusive right to transport ) it would be advisable to suggest the insertion of the words ”or transport between the words 'sell” and 'within” in Article 4(c; of the draft Agreement. This would follow the procedure adopted in Article 3 of the Debai Commercial Agreement. Consequential alterations would be necessary in ^ub-clauses (a) and (b). (e; In view of the explanation regarding Article 5 in Veightman’s letter (including the enclosed letter of 6th February from r* Javiesy, we can hardly attempt to insist on an obligation to maintain In operation a fixed number of 'strings of tools”. (f; As retards Weightman’s comments on Article 9 , we agree that it would be desirable to insert the words 'royalty paying” where he suggests. y ^ ,Ye note that Articles XII, XVIII, XIX and XXI! of the original Bahrein lease of 29th December, l»- , 34, are omitted ' from the new draft. We feel that provisions of this kind ‘ ought to apply to tne unallotted area. But possibly the Intention is to cover these points in connection with the consolidated concession covering all the Company's rights and obligations in Bahrein, w ich you say may be negotiated at a later date. (hy In your first amended version of the draft you Included, as Article 11 , the clause regarding pollution of coastal waters which Starling suggested in the penultimate _ , paragraph of hla letter 1.0.89/1 of 87th Way, 193*.

As you will see the problem of the pre-emption schedule has now been advanced to the stage where the India Office suggest that the Shaikh of Bahrain might in certain circum stances be advised (or required) to take over all crude oil gotten under the Concession and all refinery products. 3. As you know I am only too anxious to see the conclusion of this question of the Unallotted Area Concession, and all that &gt; that involves, in the interests of the Shaikh of Bahrain and, as a corollary, of His Majesty*s Government. It is therefore only with the greatest reluctance that I suggest that the present proposal made by the India Cffice ought to be consider ed in the light of the Bahrain Order in Council. Under 'Ghat Order in Council jurisdiction over British suojects ano. foreign- ers and over their property is reserved to His Majesty. How then can His Highness the Shaikh, whether aavised or not by His Majesty's Government, 'take over' the crude oil won by the Bahrain Petroleum Company and its products ?

In so far as a line must be drawn in the vicinity of the Hawar Islands I am still awaiting the receipt of a large scale photographic map. (I have received a very small scale photograph, but have asked Air Headquarters, Iraq, through the Air Liaison Officer, Bahrain, for something larger). X propose to submit .my HI suggestions when this map is received. 3. As to the Fasht al Dibal (Jibal) I find no evidence that the Shaikh of Qatar has ever claimed this reef It is true tha paragraph 4 of his letter No-T/S?' dated the 20th August 1937 my predecessor remarked that the .uler of Qatar l^y c i ,Fasht al Dibal, but in point of fact he has not done so. The HT /” Mi P-400S&amp;P -(M 480)—26-7-34 —2,00,000.Bahrain Government erected their 'national mark' on this &amp; reef as welX as on Qa'tt.ah. al tTaracia in 'this wintar of X937-38 and no protest was ever made by the Shaikh of Qatar. Only last January when the Bahrain Petroleum Company were undertaking a seismographic survey of these reefs their dynamite barge went adrift in a storm from the lee of Qattah al Jarada and was salvaged on the Qatar Coast. I had some correspondence with the Shaikh of Qatar at the time about its return and it is significant that the Shaikh did not mention any objections to their operations on and around these reefs. If I am instructed to enquire from the Shaikh of Qatar whether he claims them he will undoubtedly accept the implied sugges tion and make a claim — neither he nor any other Arab Ruler would miss so admirable an opportunity. In view however of his silence during the past two years since the Bahrain marks were erected I see little purpose in doing so. On the other hand I suggest that the uncontested exhibition of the Bahrain Government marks for so long a period is sufficient to estab lish Bahrain rights. I might mention incidentally that my information, which I have not personally checked by observa tion at high spring tides, is that a small part of both these reefs remains exposed at all states of the tide. 4. On the larger question of marking a dividing line between the interests of Bahrain and Qatar in the waters separating the two States I am unable to express any very definite views. Apart from the Hawar group, Fasht al Dibal and )attah al Jarada, there are several,small islets in these waters, outside the three mile limit from the Qatar shore, to all of which Bahrain laid claim two years ago by the erection of national marks. If it is accepted that this act, which has not been contested by Qatar, establishes Bahrain claim to sovreign^ty, then presumably Bahrain also obtains jurisdiction over areas of sea within the three mile limit around each of the islets. This however still leaves a very considerablearea of sea between the three mile territorial limits of the respective States which cannot properly be claimed by either. As you are aware relations between them are strained and I see little prospect of inducing either of them to agree to a negotiated division of their respective spheres of jurisdic tion. Presumably therefore in the areas outside territorial waters either the Bahrain Petroleum Company, as the client of the Bahrain Sheikhdom, or Petroleum Concessions Limited, as the client of Qatar, can conduct operations by way of explo ration or exploitation and it is conceivable that as a result an extremely ugly situation may arise. I can only suggest that the two Companies be invited to come to an unofficial agreement between themselves to avoid this in so far as non territorial waters between the two States are concerned.

Dear Peel, In reply to your letter of the 14th February last P.Z.620/40, concerning the Bahrein unallotted area agreements, I write to say that v/e were very reluctant to abandon the pre-emption clause in its original form because an agreement of this nature direct with the company has, we think, considerable advantages over an agreement in which our pov/er to take action is dependent on our relations v/ith or an agreement by the Sheikh himself. The absence of the pre-emption clause in the original Bahrein concession was a matter of considerable concern to the Admiralty, though at a later stage it was accepted that we should, in fact, in the case of Bahrein, where our grip is much tighter than with the other Sheikhs in this area, be able to act through the Sheikh to get what we wanted in time of war. As a result, however, of this anxiety, great care was taken to get the pre-emption clause inserted in the other concessions in the area. If we now make a new agreement without the simple pre-emption clause, this may be a precedent to other agreements in areas where our status with tne local Sheikh is not so firm. However, v/e understand that the eifect ol t^e •-•Peel, India agreement now proposed, he given by the Sheikh, under both the old cone Ssq.,C.B.E., Office, S. V. 1 # coupled with the undertaking to is to subject production ussion and the new to a qualii-ed form/form of pre-emption, and in consequence v/e should make a definite gain in respect of our position vis-a-vis the old concession. Assuming that this is a fact, we agree that the arrangement now suggested should he accepted if it is quite clear that the company will not accept the ordinary pre-emption clause. As regards the draft Schedule, it seems quite possible that HoM.Government might not require the Sheikh to take over the whole production, and this being so, it seems necessary to insert the words ’'or any of the” in front of the words ’’crude pil” and ’’products” in the first and second lines of the Schedule, A copy of this letter has been sent to Eyres and Ravenshear, Yours sincerely, (Sd.)C.G.Jarrett.THIS DEED made between HIS HI GHEE S3 SHAIKH SIR liM-L'J) BIN SHAIKH T ISAi\L KILILIEIJi, K.C.I.E. , C.

P # Z. 590/40. 21st March, 1940. Dear Mr. Ballantyne, We are at last in a position to communicate to you the views of His Majesty’s Government upon the agreements required to give effect to the decision of the Sheikh of Bahrein to give to your Company a concession in respect of the Unallotted Area. Y/e regret the delay, but I think you appreciate the difficulties which have hampered con sultation with the other Departments concerned. With regard to the draft concession agreement of which you left a copy here on the 26th June, we have the following suggestions to make, subject to which no objection is seen to the terms of the draft. (i) Ar ticle 4 . It is clearly the intention (sub-article (c)) that the Company should not have a complete monopoly of marketing oil within the Sheikh's present and future dominions, but such a monopoly is apparently implicit in the exclusive right to transport (sub-article (a)). To remove the inconsistency it is suggested that the word 'transport' should be omitted from sub-article (a) and that the words 'or transport' should be inserted after 'Sell' in sub-article (c). (ii) Article 9 . It is suggested that the v/ords 'royalty paying' should be inserted before 'oil' in the phrase immediately preceding the proviso clause, i.e. 'shall be roya11y paying oil produced in the Sheikh's present and future dominions'. The object is to make it clear that the specified amount is a net figure, and is not subject/ ^allantyne, Esq.,subject to any deduction resulting from the arrangement under which gas produced in the refining process and used in uhe furnaces is converted by an agreed formula into an equivalent amount of oil fuel and then deducted from the royalty pacing total of crude oil as 'oil required for the customary operations of the Company's installations 1 '. (iii) It is considered that provisions corresponding to Articles XII, XVIII, XIX and XXII of the 1934 lease should apply also to the unallotted Area. May we presume that this will at any rate be effected in the comprehensive concession which I think the Company intend subsequently to negotiate to cover all their rights in the Sheikh’s territory? (iv) It is considered desirable to include in the concession an article providing against the pollution of coastal waters by oil etc. I believe that this was mentioned to you orally last May or June and that you thought there would be no difficulty over it. 3. To prevent any confusion I enclose a copy of the draft concession agreement as received from you last June and containing, in words underlined, the suggestions made in the preceding paragraph. 4. I also enclose a draft, as amended in the light of discussion with you last June, of the political agreement between the Company and His Majesty's Government. You will find that we have gone far to meet your suggestions, and I hope that you will be able to recommend the present draft for your Company's approval. The only explanation I think I need make is with reference to the pre-emption provisions of the former draft. We should have greatly preferred to retain them, since they are in accordance with accepted practice elsewhere in the Arab States of the Gulf as well as in India. I understand, however, that you are unableto advise your Cor.Toanv tri j-v j x uuiujdiv to accept the provisions as they stood, and that being so we are in the circumstances prepared to adopt the alternative proposed in clause 9 and the schedule of the enclosed draft, provided of course that the trilateral arrangement suggested is rounded off by an agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Sheikh, who has not yet been approached in this respect. I understand however that so far as you are concerned the arrangement is one which your Company is likely to 'be able to accept. Yours sincerely, Sgd. Peel.INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.1. URGENT. 26th March, 1940. Dear Jarrett, Many thanks for your letter of the 20th March (M.03201/40) about the Bahrein Unallotted Area agreements. We found after further discussion that the Company maintained their objections to the pre-emption provisions as originally proposed by us, and we therefore were obliged to offer them the compromise which you were prepared if necessary to accept. A copy of our letter to Mr. Ballantyne is being sent to you separately. 2. I discussed the agreements today with Mr. Ballantyne and Mr. Thornburg, one of the American directors, and find that, except for one point, they are prepared to accept our amendments of the commercial concession and also the draft of the political agreement now offered to them. The exception relates to the schedule to the political agreement. The Company are very anxious to ensure that they will not be kept waiting an unreasonable time for payment for oil etc. taken over by or on behalf of His Majesty s Government. Consequently they wish to insert, as a new sub-paragraph of paragraph 1 (iv) of the schedule, the following — 'Unless otherwise agreed upon, payments shall be made to the Company at Bahrein within 30 (or, if His Majesty’s Government press for it, within 60 ) days after delivery . 3 . It was obvious that the Company attached much importance ro tins stipulation of a period within which payment is to be made, and piihS, facie it seems reasonable in principle. Would you kindly let us know as soon as possible whether you concur in the amendment. 4. If you could give me some indication in the course of tomorrow (Wednesday) C. G. Jarrett, Esq., Admiralty, S.W. 1.(Wednesday) of how the Admiralty would regard the amendment I should be most grateful. Mr. Thornburg leaves England on Thursday morning and I should like to be able to let him kno*v */b- 0 whej. the amendment is likely to cause trouble. am sending a copy of this letter to Ravenshear.

Dear Mr. Peel, r \, !C/\J Thank you for your letter of the 21st March (P.2.590/ 40) and the accompanying drafts. I have to inform you, in reply, as follows;— (a) The draft of the Deed of Further Modification of the Lease dated 29th December 1934, as amended by you, is satisfactory to my Company. There are one or two verbal corrections to be made for engrossing purposes; these I have shewn in red ink on the draft accompanying your letter to me, and which draft is enclosed herewith. Would you be good enough to return this draft to me at your convenience. (b) To answer the question in sub-clause (iii) of clause 2 of your letter, I would say that the provisions of Articles XII, XVIII, XIX and XXII of the 1934 Lease, will, by virtue of the new Deed of Modification, be extended to the unallotted area. On the other hand, the political provisions in the present Lease remain in the Lease, although they will be superseded by the new Political Agreement. These provisions can be left out of the comprehensive Concession which, as you rightly believe, the Company intend subsequently to negotiate to cover in one document all their rights in the Sheikh’s territory. (c) The Company also instruct me to say that the form of the Political Agreement accompanying your letter under reply, is also one which they are pleased to be able to accept with the two slight exceptions which were mentioned to Mr. G-ibson at the talk Mr. Max Thornburg and I had with him this afternoon.These exceptions are:- (i) The provision to he made for the payment for oil or oil products as they are delivered from time to time or v/ithin a specified period of delivery, and (ii) That the place of payment he Bahrain. I have modified in red ink, one of the drafts you kindly sent to me for my use, and return it to you so that you may see the wording of the alterations we asked for. I may add that although it is considered to he important that the place of payment should he designated, if xxpssihle, it is imperative that the provision as to payment should he made. Prom their experience in these matters, the Company see no reason why a fair price should not he readily ascertainable for oil and oil products taken over hy His Majesty’s Government, and also why those prices should not he paid on or a short time after delivery.

When this matter of the ownership of certain islands and reefs lying between Qatar and Bahrein came under consideration in April, 1930, in connexion with the negotiations for the Bahrein unalioted area, it was proposed, on the recommendation of the late Sir Trenchard Fowle (who v/as consulted during his visit to London) chat the Sheikh of Qatar should be given an opportunity to state any claim he might wish to make in respect of one / Hawar Islands and Fasht Dibal.

Dear Mr. Peel, ^ r Referring to your official letter P.Z.6371/39 of the 26th October, 1939, I write to enquire whether any decision has yet been reached as to the line of division between the territories and the territorial waters of Bahrain and Qatar. Information has reached us that the Bahrain Oil Co. has recently carried out a seismographic survey of the reefs shown as Katah and Juradeh and Pasht and Disbal on Admiralty chart ’‘Approaches to Bahrain’ 1 . These reefs, which are approximately midway between Bahrain Island and Qatar, are submerged at high tide and dry out in patches at low tide; other similar reefs exist in the Bahrain - Qatar waters and, as far as I am aware no record exists as to their ownership, although I admit Petroleum Concessions Ltd. assumed that some of the reefs belonged to the State of Bahrain and were therefore included in the area for which application was made by Petroleum Concessions Ltd. for a concession from that State. The successful results obtained from our well at Dukhan (Qatar) render it highly desirable from Petroleum Concessions Ltd. point of view that the delimitation of the boundary between territories and territorial waters of the States of Bahrain and Qatar should be finally fixed^as early as possible in order that our programme of exploration may be fully considered. I shall, therefore, be grateful if I could be informed of the present position of this matter. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.)

On the evidence at present available to H.M.G. these islands appear to belong to the Sheikh of Bahrein. H.M.G., however, have reason to believe that he, the Sheikh of Qatar, may wish to advance claims to these islands.

I enclose a further copy for ready reference. 2. It is undoubtedly the case, as Prior points out, that jurisdiction over foreign Companies and foreign property in Bahrein is exercised by us, and not by the Sheikh; and although our draft agreement spoke of the Sheikh acting on the advice and on behalf of His Majesty’s Government we think, on reconsideration, that it would be preferable as Prior suggests to omit the reference to the Sheikh in the draft Article 9 and the Schedule. Thus, the legal position being as pointed out in Prior’s telegram, there can be no doubt that His Majesty T s Government can legally take and exercise powers to commandeer the Company’s products - or even, if necessary to take over their installation - in an emergency# 3# It is hov/ever still our intention that before the concession is approved by Kis Majesty’s Government the Sheikh should be required to take cognisance of the political agreement (as in Koweit and elsewhere), and to forestall any possible misapprehension on his part we propose to ask the political authorities to communicate the draft to the Sheikh before it is concluded here, and to explain to him the meaning of the 'requisitioning” clause and the reason for its substitution for pre-emption provisions. •Jarrett, Esq., Admiralty.

The Political Agent, Bahrain, presents his comuliments to:— The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. and has the honour to send him a copy of the undermentioned document (s) The Agency, BAHRAIN, Persian Gulf Reference to previous correspondence: Residency telegram No. 161 dated the 16th April 1940 Description of Enclosure. Name and Date. Subject. Letter No. 207 dated the 4th April 1909 from Major F.B. Prideaux, Political Agent, Bahrain^ to the Politi cal Resident, Bushire. H A W A RPolitical Agency, Bahrain, 4th April 1909. From Major F.B. Prideaux, Political Ageht Bahrain To The Political Besident in the Persian Gulf Bushire Sir I have the honour to report that the Turkish officials in Hasa, under their present Mutasarrif Mahir Pasha, are aoparently making some effort to establish their autho rity more securely in the rather vaguely defined district over which they rule. 2. During the last week of February 1909, I heard that the Mudir of Cjair had been corresponding with the Dowasir tribesmen who periodically visit Zakhnuniya Island from Bahrain, with a view to getting them to admit their alle giance to the Turkish throne. A week or two later the rumour reached Bahrain that a Turkish salaried Faimmakam had been despatched to Doha to take over the government of the town (or whole Katar Peninsula, perhaps, as the ^urks claim it) from Shaikh Jasim bin Thani and his deputy son, Abdallah bin Jasim. 3 . On the 8th March I proceeded to Lusail, Shaikh Jasim 1 s headquarters, in the Agency Launch, and on the 10th the old chief rode in from the interior to meet me. I also despatched a Confidential reporter, who had accompanied me from Bahrain, by name v usuf bin Ahmad hano, overland to /-2 - (JZC Doha to collect all the authentic news possible connected with the object of my visit. 4. Shaikh Jasim received me very cordially, and appeared to be enjoying better health than I had «ver seen him in before. He scoffed at the notion that there had been any recent ill-feeling between the Turks and himself, and declared that in the matter of the A1 bu Ainain disaffection at Vv'akra the Government had supported him quite as much as he could wish. The new official who had come to the fort at Bida ! was, he said, connected with the troops, and though he had tried occasionally to give advice to Shaikh Abdallah (Jasim’s son), the latter had resolutely ignored him. When I observed that I had heard that the Turks were talking of assuming the Administration of the Customs, Shaikh Jasim said the revenue from this source was insignificant, being only about Rs.400/- monthly, and barely sufficient to defray the cost of t he bazar watchman. To please the British c.f.Persian Gulf' Residency Diary government he had intro- Sntry No.1340 for week ending ) 7 th July 1907 )duced a heavy tax to kill the trade in slaves and arms, but provisions and other ne- cessaries were still admitted free. The latter part of this statement I am quite sure is not true, though the ohaikh went to the length of calling in my pilot, a Tatar hahkoda, to confirm what he said, and the man actually did so until we had left the Shaikh’s presence ’. Iwy messenger in Doha reported on his return that the iurkish official aoout whom we had been uneasy was ostensibly a Kazi, such as was attached to the Government Staff in Hofuf and Katif, and that his post in Doha v/ould be quite a sinecure as no Arabs v/ould ever go near him. We found on our return to Bahrain that this v/orthy had personally hurried off to Fasa via Bahrain to report the news of my visit the instant he heard it* in i)oha*5. .On the 17th March I left Bahrain again in the Staam Launch to visit Zakhnuniya Island which is situated close to the mainland about 10 miles south of Ojair. The most recent news about this place had been that the Mudir of Ojair had just visited the island, taking two or three military officers with him and a Turkish flag, and that he had asked the Dowasir, whom he met there, whether they had settled anything with t- eir headman in Bahrain about coming under Turkish rule. The tribesmen replied that they had decided not to accent his (the Mudir's) advice , as they might then perhaps lose their possessions in Bahrain. The Mudir afterwards proceeded to the ruined fort on the west side of the island, and ran up the flag. He then told the Dowasir that he did not ask of them anything, except to run up and lower the flag every day at sunrise and sunset, and when they all left the island to re turn it to him in Ojair. The Dowasir declined to comply with this request, and most of them returned to Bahrain soon after the Mudir’s departure. 6 . I landed on Zakhnuniya on the 18th March and found that there was only one boat of fishermen on the beach. The men, Bahrain subjects, were living in two or three temporary mat huts at the southern extremity of the island and were engaged in fishing for sharks, swordfish etc., The dilapidated fort on the V/est side of the island was uninhabited, but I noticed that a Turkish flag was rolled up and attached to the bottom end of the halyard and fastened tight to the mast. The island is absolutely devoid of trees and brackish water is only obtainable in small quantities from shallow pits in the hollow of sand mounds. 7. From Zakhnuniya I proceeded straight across the Bay of Bahrain to Hawar Island, where the Dowasir have two similar winter villages. Here I found in one locality a collection of 40 large huts under the authority of a cousin of the tribal principal /-principal Shaikh. This individual, Ssa bin Ahmad Dosiri f is also related by marriage to Shaikh 3sa bin Ali, and he told me that he had at first thought that the Launch was a Turkish gunboat, a visit from which they quite expected to receive. He also told me that Zakhnuniya was undoubtedly a oossession of the Chief of Bahrain, but that the Dov/asir regarded Kawar as their own independent territory, the ownership of this island having been awarded to the tribe by the Fazi of Zu- bara more than 100 years ago, in a written decision which they still preserve. The contesting tribe named A1 bu Tobais now is appa rently extinct, but as the Kazi of Zubara was in those days an official of the A1 Khalifah, the island would s &gt;em to be a dependency of the mainland State, which the Chief of Bahrain still claims as morally and theoretically his. 8 . On my return to Bahrain, I informed Shaikh Esa as soon as possible of the result of my trip, and he at once said \ that he desired to make a written protest on the subject of the Turkish occupation of Zakhnuniya. He remarked that his father Shaikh Ali had built the fort, with the concurrence of the Najd Amir, Bin Saud (who then ruled the adjacent main land), for the protection of his central possessions, and that for some years he had kept a garrison on the island. When the necessity for this had ceased he had withdrawn his men, but at a latter date one of the Chief Bowasir had re paired the fort with his, Shaikh Esa’s, permission, and on account of the blood feud with the A1 Morra it was not very safe now to live on, but at the same time the Shaikh ob jected strongly, to the Turks annexing the place. Anooher possession,' outside of the Bahrain Islands, which the Chief holds and from which he derives several hundred Krans in revenue each year, is the reef situated about 7 miles froi$i Budaiya (North-west town of Bahrain), which is actually on the west or mainland side of the deep water channel from Katif to Cjair. This reef named Labaina included the two islets /-- 5 - % islets (2 feet high), marked on the Admiralty Ghart”0.l Bahrain to Cgair” which are respectively known as Labainat al Aliya and Labainat as Safliya. The Shaikh takes a 3 tax from all the boats which collect turtle shell on these islets, and if the Turks maintain their right to Zakhnuniya, they may soon see fit to claim the two northern islets, as they claimed the Ilazwa Sand-bank neat Katif in March 1907. 9. I enclose a translation of Shaikh Ssa’s formal letter of protest, and venture strongly to recommend that favourable consideration be given to it.Translation of a letter from Shaikh Esa bin Ali A1 Khalifah Chief of Bahrain to Major F.B. prideaux.

Wa * C/378-10/14 DaUd 1st May 1948' 7 Bahrain Unallotted Area During the last three months His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain and his Family have become increasingly disgruntled at the non-receipt of His Majesty*s Government*s final decision regarding the lease of the Unallotted Area. 2. In the course of an interview to-day His Highness raised this subject. He pointed out that he had sent in the draft of the proposed Agreement for the Additional Area no less than 11 months ago and that he believed that the delay was due solely to the protracted negotiations between His Majesty*s Government and the Company relating to their own agreement. It appeared to him that his interests and the interests of Bahrain were being ignored.3 . I undertook to communicate His Highness comments by telegram but after leaving him I heard of the Mediterranean crisis and it seemed improper to use the cables at the present juncture for a telegram on such a subject as this- Nevertheless I would urgently recommend that a telegram be sent to His Majesty’s Government at the earliest possible tinned delay in communicating their final decision has created a situation here which is rapidly becoming more and more difficult. I have endeavoured to satisfy His Highness by suggesting that a decision would undoubtedly have been communicated by now but for the fact that His Majesty’s Government must be fully preoccupied with the affair in Norway^ but it would be idle to disguise the fact that explanations of this sort can give only very temporary satisfaction and that His Highness and his Family are greatly puzzled and hurt by the apparent neglect of their interests. At least one important member of the Family apparently believes that the delay is due to the displeasure of His Majesty’s Government at His Highness’ decision to conclude an agreement with the American Company and the suggestion has even been made that in these circumstances it might be better for the Bahrain Government to re-open negotiations with another Company. moment drawing their attention to the fact that the con- political Agent, Bahrain.n r-i r\ f r r rfident,ial .. u&gt; \(\Vo' BUSH I RE RRn’DENCY. No £9J Date.... lL *~. comDinDM nEcor.os D.C.No.G/401-10/14. Dated the 10th May 1940. A .a •C-UI — In my Express letter No.0/378 dated the first May 1940 I reported the growing discontent of the Shaikh of Bahrain and his family at the non-arrival of His Majesty 1 s Government* s final decision regarding the lease of the Unallotted Area. In case that report is insufficient to secure a more urgent examination of the question, I think it would he as well to indicate now the grave results that may attend continued inactivity. It is evident from India Office '-L telegram No. 2842 dated the 11th November 1939 that at that time His Majesty* s Government had considered whether delay might not cause material loss to Bahrain, and it is true that at that time Bahrain interests were not affected. This however is not the case today - six months later. 2. From the correspondence forwarded with India Office - Jo-er Printed letter No. 1684/40 dated the 29th March 1940 it is evident that agreement has been reached on all outstanding points relating to the Political Agreement with the exception- af the question of the time within which payment should be made for oil taken by His Majesty’s Government. It is of course true that up to the end of March His Majesty's Government expected to make use of t he Shaikh* s intervention in taking over crude oil and its products and that it was necessary to draw attention to the legal inconsistency between this pro- oosal and the urovisions of the Bahrain Order-in-Council; ~ . fo Hl but it is equally clear from their letter No. P.Z.1888/40 dated the 8th April 1940 that the India Office have accepted the contention raised by the Gulf, which in effect involves ' A;n, ble Lieutenant Colonel : C.G.Prior, C.I.E., '-wtical Resident in the Persian Gulf, only /-only the excision of a word or two from the draft pre-emption schedule. Thus there still seems little reason to doubt tne correctness of tne statement that the sole Question im peding the final decision is the time within which payments are to be made; and as for this I am informed that the Admiralty themselves at the end of l arch oronosed a scheme of tentative payments with provision for later adjustments 9 which the Company stated they were prepared to accept. Another month has however gone by without any decision being communicated. All this may seem a somewhat tedious preamble, but it seems well to visualise, as early as we can at this end, the the cause no less tnan the effect of the hold-up. 3. The first effedt of continued delay will be the aban donment of the geophysical exploration of the shoal waters included in the ( so far) Unallotted Area. The Company began this work last year in the belief that the new concession would be signed andsealed before they had gone very far. They have been spending not far from Rs.90,000 a month on this work and what may be called the preliminary part of the task is finished. If they are now to carry on with it they must at once purchase new equipment and prepare for a programme on a far more costly basis. I am informed defin itely that the New York and San Fransisco offices will not consider this until the new lease is signed. The present position is that they have a G.3.I. party with marine experi ence here and that unless a decision is communicated in the very near future so that they can start work again 1 jnediately after the Barah this party will be dispersed — and will be difficult to reassemble. This alone would be sufficiently damaging to Bahrain interests. 4. Secondly it must be remembered that until the new lease is signed neither the 'Royalty protective'* clauses in it nor /-3 nor ( this is even more important) the Company's '‘declaration of intention” contained in their letter of the 5th June 1339 (cf. penultimate paragraph of my Express letter ho*C/376 dated the 10th June 1939) become operative. 3o far the Company have maintained Bahrain production at an average round about 20,oCQ bai'rels a day. This is being done in the face of considerable pressure from the California Arabian Standard Oil Company as I have reported from time to tinej cH-Gt ecei.o developments have intensified this pressure. As you know the California Arabian Standard Oil Company have had to advance very considerable sums to Ibn Saud which are to oe adjusted against Royalties and not unnaturally their argument is that having in'effect paid advance Royalties on Arabian Crude oil they want to export that oil. This can only be^at the expense of Bahrain —^and the parents of both that the decision has been taken to build a refinery of 25,000 barrels per day capacity at Has Tanura. There are other recent developments which also have a bearing on the whole question of oil marketing; the interruption of traffic through the Mediterranean which one would imagine is bound to result in at least a part of the Anglo-Iranian exports to England being diverted to the Eastern Hemisphere; the closure of the German market; and major developments in the United States and Colombia which you will probably have seen reported in oil journals of the last few months and which must have a very considerable effect on oil economics. 5. It seems to me that every day that passes without a decision jeopardises more and more Bahrain's prospects of receiving Oil Royalties on a maintained production of 20,000 barrels daily. Admittedly the Company's 'letter of intention” has no real contractual value but the fact remains that in the Companies are the same. It is also not without significance circumstances /\&lt;?o) - 4 - m circumstances of this part of the world it is pretty nearly as good as a contract unless the Company can convince the Shaikh that obstruction caused by the delay which has occurred in London has provided them with adequate grounds for Revising their intentions. 6 . One does not need to be reminded that there is a war on and that eve;py one, particularly at the Admiralty, is working at very high pressure. But surely it must be an important part of our war policy to maintain the positi on that we have gained in this part of the Gulf; and it is scarcely necessary to remark that if dilatoriness in London results in Bahrain production being cut back, with a consequent diminuti n of the Shaikh’s Royalties, that position will be lost over-night. In less than four weeks from to-day a full year will have expired since the Shaikh of Bahrain sent in the draft Agreement and sought the advice of the British Government. It seems there is only one point out standing, and for that point the Admiralty themselves have proposed a solution. hhy then should the existing situation continue, fraught as it is with such grievous possibilities ?

X' p v/ould you please refer to your letter of the 26th March regarding the draft agreements to be entered into by your Company with the oheikh of Bahrein and with His Majesty f s Government in respect Oi. the projDosed concession over the ’’Unallotted Area. *' . Q , , 2 * n , 1 Th ® c1 - r ‘ aft ^eed of Further Modification of the Lease dated 29th Decemoer 1934 is now settled. 3. v/ith regard to your proposed amendment of clause 1 (iv) of the Schedule to the draft political agreement I an. to say that the amendment is accepted in principle, but it is considered that the specified period for making payment should be 60 days, and that the amendment should allow for provisional payment in the event of an agreement as to price not having been reached within the period. It is suggested therefore that the amendment should run - ‘’Unless otherwise agreed upon, payments shall be made to the Company at Bahrein within 60 days after delivery; provided that, if the price_should not have been finally settled, payment may be made within the prescribed period, provisionally and subject to subsequent adjustment if necessary, at the price offered by His Majesty’s Government.' The Admiralty add that payment for their bulk fuel oil contracts placed f.o.b. Abadan, frinidad, etc. is made to the respective oil companies in London, and they feel a /\ you r Company has an office in London, payment to t.xa o oil ice v/ould probably be much more convenient than for an Admiralty account to be opened at Bahrein, They are however prepared, if the Company should still desire payment at Bahrein, to arrange for payment to be made by their Divisional Accountant Officer at Bahrein. 4. It has been decided, on further consideration, to make certain amendments to Article 9 and the opening sentence of the Bchedule of the political agreement so as to place responsibility for the exercise of ‘‘force majeure“ on His Majesty’s Government, who in fact exercise jurisdiction over British and foreign property in Bahrein. The amendments, to which we think you will see no objection, are; in Article 9, the sentence to begin “If, in the event of national emergency or war, His Majesty’s Government should render” etc., etc, , and after the middle of the sentence, omit the words “the Sheikh and” before “His Majesty’s Government”; while the opening words of the Schedule the words ”tne Sneikh on behalf of” are to be omitted. 5. If you concur in these amendments the draft political agreement will be shown to the &gt;bheikh and if he assents thereto steps will then be taken for its completion.

In the second paragraph of your telegram No. 366 dated the 7th June 1940 there is reference to my failure to. report action .b 111 taken by the Bahrain Government, while in the last paragraph doubt is thrown on the justice of the decision in the Hawar case which ^ f) 1*5 • ^ was based on a factual report submitted by me. bince in ooth cases £5 indeed also in my assumption that the erection of a national mark constitutes a valid method of claiming sovereignty in unoccupie areas — the advantage goes to Bahrain, I fear tn.it the inference might be drawn that there was some question of my entire impartiali ty. (With regard to the Hawar case I do not of course attempt to claim that I am incapable of missing a possible line of enquiry). 3/- s e3 I Cc.n only repeat that Sir Trenchard Fowle was lully aware of the fact that Bahrain had erected their national marks on all islands or islets to which they laid claim in the winter of 1937-38. it is true that my Express - Letter No. C/679 of the 5th November 1938 Y.c.s written in the course of correspondence regarding a dispute between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, but the fii si sentence of paragraph 2 thereof does not restrict the reference to erection of national marks by the Bahrain Government to islands lying between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia ihe reference in the same sentence to the original proposal to divide the Unallotted Area between the two Oil Companies (i.e. Bahrain Petroleum Company and Petroleum Concessions Limited) serves further to indicate that the erection of national marks had been made on all sides of the Island and not merely on the west. ✓ p * ^ 1 4. It occurs to me that the reference in paragraph 4 of my Express letter No. C/236 dated the 26th March 1940 to ’’several small islets in these waters outside the three mile limit from the Qatar shore” may have led you to believe that I was referring to islands or islets contiguous to the three mile limit from Qatar. This is not the case, and the reference to the three mile limit was only inserted to dis tinguish these islets from those of the Haw-ar Group of which many are within three miles of the main Qatar coast.

I regret it has not yet been possible to submit proposals for the delimitation of the Hawar group of islands (vide cor- - respondence resting with your telegram No. 366 dated the 7th June 1940)» I received a large scale map from Air Headquarters in the late Spring and had intended to complete this photo graphic map in certain respects in which it is deficient by a personal visit to Hawar with Squadron Leader Coates who had offered his assistance in tracing an addition to the map. Unfortunately, with the outbreak of total war in early May, neither of us were able to leave Bahrain for the length of time necessary before the heat of summer made our proposed operation impossible. I regret therefore that I have had to leave this matter to my successor.

Petroleuiji Concessions limited have not referred to the question M'ri since their letter of 26th February 1940. In any case it would be difficult for the Departments concerned to consider the matter very thoroughly in the conditions of war-time, and the need for a decision may be the less urgent if, as there was recently reason to believe, the Bahrein Petroleum Co. intend to slow down development work and concentrate on production.

Dalrymple Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E., Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Dear Sir, Owing to the international situation and the resultant shortage of man-power, we are finding it impossible to maintain the rapid pace which we have kept during the last two years on exploratory work in the Additional Area. We write this letter to explain our position and to ask your consideration of our problem. It may be of interest to you if we outline here the work which already has been accomplished in the exploration of the Additional Area: 1. A complete-triangulation survey was made. 2. A map of the entire area was prepared. 3. A surface geological survey was made. 4. A costly geophysical survey was made by reflection seismograph. 5. Eleven structure holes were drilled in the sea, on smaller islands and on the littoral of the main island, and another bore is being started. 6 . A complete geological study has been made of all available data. The entire job has now reached the stage where we have 40 ^ some conception of the structural relationships in the Area, and we are of the opinion that a few more structure holes drilled at various points will probably complete the picture. (In this connection we again request permission to drill at Saafa since it is a location which could be drilled from a stone pier, and would /-2 * 2 &gt; ■$£ - 2 - would furnish a great amount of information*) Most of the structure locations which can be drilled with little white labour have been drilled, and the remaining places which we would drill were conditions normal are in deeper water. The deeper water locations necessitate the construction of steel piers which in turn require the use of pile-driver and A-frame barges, machanics, welders, and other skilled staff which we are short of in our routine producing and refining operations. We have been unable to get any men skilled in these trades from England for many months, and at present we are unable to attract Americans. We wish hereby to advise you and the Bahrain Government of the situation, and to inform you that we are pursuing and will continue to pursue structure drilling to the best of our ability and to the limits justified by results obtained. We should appreciate your written recognition and approval of this program. Yours very truly, Sd. R. A. Kennedy.

In this connection please refer to my predecessor’s memorandum No. C/762 dated the 9th October 1940 to which no reply appears to have been received in this office nor was any reply furnished to the Company’s letter. 3. My predecessor, in paragraph 2 of his letter, had pro posed to reply to the Company that there was no objection to the drilling of the holes on the main Hawar Island. As regards the present reauest for permission to bore a third hole on the sand bank named Sowad Janubiya, my feeling is that although these banks appear to belong to the Hawar group awarded to Bahrain yet in view of the fact that they are partly submerged and are very close indeed to the Qatar shore it would have been better had the Company confined themselves to -questions on the main island, until such time at any rate as the exact boundaries of the group have been laid down. 4. I would be grateful to Company. * VcK/Vrvc'i I • know what reply to give the Political Agent, Bahrain.Copy of letter No. PA-680 dated the 20th September 1941 from the Chief Local Representative.

We would appreciate your attention to this matter Copy of letter No. FA-461 dated the 20th September 1941 flrom the Chief Local Represartative, The Bahrain Petr Company Limited, Bahrain, to the Financial Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain. In accordance with Article V of the Deef of Further Modification dated June 19, 1940, whereby the Company agrees to pursue geological work within the Additional Area, we are hereby requesting the Government»s permission to drill three holes for structural information, two on Hawar Island and one on the adjacent sand island, Sowad Janubiya. The approximate positions of the proposed locations are shown in red ink on the attached Map No. BR-999. ; During the drilling of thes wells, we will take frequent water samples and obtain all possible information with the object of ascertaining the possibility of develop ing a satisfactory domestic water supply. at your earliest convenienceOWNERSHIP OF HAWAR 1. The feeling amongst impartial Arabs regarding the ownership of Hawar Islands is that they are a part of Qatar and that the Dowasir living on the Island are on the same footing as those who go to Zakhnuniyah or Dhammam. That is to say when they are in Qatar (Hawar) they should be amena ble to the Shaikh as in Arabia they are amenable to the King and in Bahrain to the Shaikh, 2. It is not the custom in these parts to erect n national marks n of the sort used by the Bahrain Authorities and then wait for other parties to dispute them. In any case to do it so hurriedly just before the ownership question was raised seems rather like sharp practice. The same applies to the 'building' of a fort there and garrisoning it with Police. 3. The Shaikh of Bahrain has always been discouraged from himself up with affairs in Qatar i,e. Zubarah where there were far more of his followers and concrete signs of occupation than at Hawar. 4. The Dowasir are rather independent as can be seen from the way they deserted their town of Budaya in Bahrain for the mainland. They are not true inhabitants of Bahrain and are able to change their allegiance at will if displeased. Their settlement in any spot does not therefore mean much more than the settlement of a migratory tribe in a neighbouring state. 5. Generally, tribal boundaries seem to take well defined natural lines which in this case would go outside the deep water and include the group with the Qatar main land. It is possible to wade from Hawar to the main land at low water and any boundary cutting off the group from the main land would be very artificial.6. A possible solution might have been to declare the Hawar Group to be a ^disputed area n and outside the scope of either oil company until its ownership was finally settled.Air Kail. 1 C0HPXD8HTIAL. Office of the Political Resident in the Perelan Gulf, D.O.Ro. C/466 Camp, Bahrain* Dated the 26th October, 194i Dear Peel Please refer to your demi-official letter UoePe£* 4000/40, dated the 16th January 1941, regarding certain areas between C^atar and Bahrain* 2. The moment I saw the decision on the Hawar Islands case I told Powle that I thought it most unfair to 4&amp;tar and the explanations he gave me for his recommendations were not ones which would carry *** weight with any Arab. I have delayed writing as I hoped to collect further information on the subject, but the separation from my oldest records and the destruction of others plus a complete lack of leisure has made a full reply to your letter impossible. 3. The Hawar Islands case has been decided according to Vestern ideas, and no allowance has been made for local custom and sentiment. During 3i years in Bahrain I never heard any thing to suggest that these islands belonged to Bahrain, and believed them to belong to Q.atar, a view supported by Lorimer. In his memorandum (undated) forwarded with Bahrain Express ^ r (j f / / 3 letter Ho.T/3-l-a/ 29 » dated the 3rd June 1939, of which copies were forwarded to you and the Government of India, Bclgr^ve makes various claims which may carry weight in Western minds but mean nothing to an Arab. 4 . I will deal with six of them i- (a) In paragraph 4 he claims the Dowaeir as Buluain The India Office, London- 2 - n and their reeidence in Hawar gives Bahrain no greater claim than they have to Zaknuniyah (see Lorimer page 391 and page 396) and when the Shaikh of Bahrain tried to control them at Budalyya they left in a huff* (b) Shaikh Isa used to pay an annual visit to Hawar* These Shaikhs used to pay an annual visit to Lingeh and still visit Hasa each year* shaikh Isa also went hawking to Zaknuniyah* (c) He helped Turkish soldiers there* Bahrain has also helped shipwrecked mariners off the Hasa coast* (d) Disputes in Hawar were tried in Bahrain. By agree* ment parties can take their oases to any &lt;^adhi and two Iraqis on the Truoial Coast could take a dispute to Karbala if they wished* It was ohly the easy sea journey and the Dowasir connection that made Bahrain a convenient forum as compared with a difficult and dangerous land journey to Dohah* (e) The Shaikh of Bahrain's fidawis were sent to Hawar to arrest people* Bin Jiluwi sent men to Bahrain at least twice when 1 was there and frequently sent them to qatar* (f) The subjection of people of Hawar to Bahrain Rules and Regulations* Bahrain never had. any rules and regulations till it had an Adviser, and he has been collecting evidence of administration in Hawar for many years past with the object of making this claim, in which he has been very successful* Had Q,atar had a British Adviser this claim could not have been made* As for the Hawaris' indignation that any one should suggest they were not Bahrain subjects, it will be remembered there is a Bahrain Police post there l 5* The view of independent Arabs is that Hawar belongs to q&amp;tar and I am convinced the decision is inequitable, but I do not feel that it is practical politics to reverse it now* I should, however, like the Bahrain and qatar cases to be placed before Daly, who has an expert knowledge of this / area3 area dating from long before it became disputed territory, and would attach great weight to his views* If he considers that s^atar has received less than its due then this should be taken into account in the demarca~ tion of the remaining disputed areas* My own tentative view is that the dividing line should run midway between the two mainlands until the latitude of the Hawar Islands is reached* The method of claiming reefs by erecting cairns and marks is totally foreign to Arab sentiment and practice and little weight should be attached to it* I am sending copies of this letter to Caroe and to Alban* ♦sent under Printed Letter No*467 of 26th 0ctobern]194l.- - V*'0 'm •ip p\ Confidential* Bo*C/469 of 1941* Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp,Bahrain* Dated the 26th October, 1941* To The Political Agent, Bahrain* Subject * Drilling on Hawar Island and adjacent sandbank^* Memorandum* Reference your Memorandum No*!/7i, dated the 27th September 1941* 2* I agree that the sandbank Sovad Janublya lies in a debatable area* Please reply to the Company that there is no objection to their drilling the two holes on the main Havar Island but that no drilling should be done for the present on the sandbank* ad* C.G.Prior* Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume comprises correspondence between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Charles Geoffrey Prior), the Political Agent at Bahrain (Hugh Weightman, Reginald George Evelin Alban), the India Office (Roland Tennyson Peel, John Percival Gibson), the Admiralty (Clifford George Jarrett), the Shaikh of Bahrain (Shaikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah), and the Bahrain Petroleum Company (Hamilton R Ballantyne) and discusses the conclusion of negotiations in London for a political agreement to accompany the concession secured by the Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO) from the Shaikh of Bahrain for the unalloted area of Bahrain.The correspondence focuses primarily on the question of whether a pre-emption clause is required in the political agreement or whether a force majeure clause would be an acceptable alternative given His Majesty’s Government’s likely need for oil in wartime and other emergencies. The negotiations were concluded in June 1941 with the concession agreement being signed in Bahrain 19 June 1941 and the Political Agreement signed in London 29 June 1941.Other correspondence discusses a request made by the Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO) to accelerate their exploration work in the Unallotted area of Bahrain and the need for a final settlement of the terms of both the concession agreement and political agreement in order to support the company’s acceleration proposal.Also discussed is the drilling work undertaken by BAPCO in order to obtain structural information on their newly acquired concession area. The drilling work undertaken had also succeeded in finding drinking water on Fasht al Jibal [Fasht ad Dībal] and their intention to drill on Hawar Island included the intention to create water wells should drinking water be found there too. The correspondence concludes with the decision taken by BAPCO in 1941 to suspend their exploration work in new areas owing to a lack of available labour and to concentrate instead on their existing production and refining activities.Another topic under discussion in the volume is the question of the ownership of the Hawar Group of Islands with His Majesty’s Government reaching a decision in August 1939 that the Hawar Group of Islands belonged to Bahrain and not Qatar. Correspondence includes the Shaikh of Qatar (Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin Jāsim Āl Thānī)’s dissatisfaction at the outcome.Later correspondence from 1941 includes the Political Agent at Bahrain and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf expressing their concerns over the decision that was reached and suggesting that the evidence be reconsidered and an expert in that area such as Sir Clive Kirkpatrick Daly be consulted for his opinion on the question.As part of the discussions a request is made to the Air Vice-Marshall, Commanding British Forces in Iraq for a photographic mosaic to be taken of the Hawar Group of Islands. The mosaic was required in order to determine a line of division between the territorial rights of Bahrain and Qatar.Also discussed was the question of ownership of the island of Fasht Dibal [Fasht ad Dībal], which was at that time claimed by Bahrain; regarding the Political Resident’s scepticism regarding the validity of Bahrain’s claim and the question of whether the Shaikh of Qatar should be given the opportunity to put forward any claim he had towards the island.One other matter of note within the volume relates to reports and rumours of attempts by Turkish officials at Hasa to secure their authority over the district they controlled. These attempts were alleged to include Turkish officials visiting Zakhnuniya Island [Jazirat az Zakhnūnīyah] to try and convince the Dowasir tribe there to swear allegiance to Turkey; it is claimed their intention was to take control of Dohah [Doha], and perhaps the whole Katar [Qatar] peninsula from the Shaikh of Qatar. The alleged movements of Turkish officials on Zakhnuniya Island resulted in an official protest being made by the Shaikh of Bahrain who considered the island to be part of his territory.A series of file notes which were maintained as a record of the correspondence in the volume can be found at folios 214-227.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Admiralty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Officer Commanding, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Concessions Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Qatar</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Fasht Dibal</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Hawar Islands</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Zakhnuniya Island</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Boundaries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Bahrain</topic></subject><subject><topic>Geological surveying</topic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial disputes</topic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Aerial photogrammetry</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00029b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
