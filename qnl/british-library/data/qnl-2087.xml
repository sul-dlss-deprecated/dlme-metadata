Lieut-Colonel m .C.W. Fowle. C.B.^SXlth Harch 1933. Ho. 376/3-13 . My deaf Humphrys, *1 1 I was very much interested to receive your letter of March 3rd (193/7/33) which drives the first definite information I have had as to the it ion of the recently captured Kuwaiti dhow at the time ot its seizure by the Persians. I had hitherto feared that it was captured in the debatable area at the end of Marakat Abadan and the eastern end of 4 he Pooka channel (see the correspondence between the Foreign Office and Admiralty of 1929). It was for this reason that I was not more precise in ray note of February 3rd and suggested to Fowle at the time that as delicate issued were involved* the Vice-Consul at Mohararnerah should merely try to obtain from the Persian authorities and the Pakhoda respective!^ a n exact description of the position of the dhow at the time of the capture. wi thout is Excellency lieutenant Colonel Sir EranhissHumphrys, Cx.C.M.Ct. , G.C.V.O., K.B.E #&gt; CIS., His Majesty’s Ambassador, Baghdad.without offering further cowmenFowle, agreed, hut Chauncy, the Vice-Consul in question, has in fact only succeeded,in extracting from the Persian authorities declarations that the dhow aas captured M in the Bahraahshlr* later altered to *in Persian territorial waters between Gusha (Kabba) and the Bahwanshir H , a phrase which I must admit fills we with considerable suspicion. ‘Tie suspicion has not been decreased by a further explanatory statement by the Governor of Mohamwerah to the effect that the same phrase was used by the Ministry for foreign Affairs in an official reply i have now received simply because they repeated what he had told them, and by his going to say that the point was that there is a Customs post at Gusba and that a Customs launch patrols there to the Bahmanshir and that it was on this patrol (exact spot uncertain) that the show was captured. The officer who seized the dhow has said, however, that it was aground at the time otf capture; and if it had been above low water mark anywhere or the Persian side it would of course presumably have been in Persian waters. He added that it was searched and found to have contraband sugar and groseries on &gt;^«r-d, that there was no proper manifest and that the Kakhoda had on him letters to two persons in Persian territory regarding delivery of the cargo. The Governor states in this connexion that it is well-known to both Iraqi and Persian Cus tors? offiaials that on payment o^ a very small sum, would-be smugglers are able to purchase two manifests, which they use as occasion requires. Tie Vice-Consul has not been able to see the Hakhoda, because the Persians declare that he is a Persian subject. He is said to have signed a concession that he was a formerly convicted smuggler and that in this instance he has a Confederate in the Persian Customs at Gusba (Kasha). 1 may say that Chauncy was told by hie Iraqi colleague quite recently that the information of + he Iraqi authorities, though based mainly on supposition, tended to confirm the claimcf the Persian authorities that the dhow had heen smuggling: the Iraqi director of customs at Pao had expressed * he fhat a cargo of sugar from Kuweit could only he sold at a loss in ^ao, and that had the dhow heen captured in Iraq waters he would certainly have heard sihout it. 'Hie question of how far we (or the Iraqis) are tp protest against such behaviour by the Persians is of course a question of policy that does not directly concern me, but is it not going +o be a little difficult to know v«ben to cease turning xfcjt a blind eye if the Persians go on doing this sort i of thing? In this particular case the Persians would, 1 / iuppose, be precluded from Maintaining that by omitting to protest we has subscribed to their view that bald the Shatt was Persian, because of their statement lb at the dhow was aground at the time of capture, or alternatively in the Bahmanshire Whether we believe them or not, it renders their version of the facts politically innocuous. But another case might have more insidious features*- I admit, however, that we do not riant any avoidable trouble while the Conservancy Board is still a possibility. As for the points about the seizure to which objection might be taken other than the fact that it took place in Iraq waters, I /will make the most of them, but it is of course a little like Hamlet without Hamlet. I can perhaps lay stress on the seizure for no good reasons of a peaceful vessel with its paoers in order, and the subsequent unnecessary detention of the crew: But I fear that the Persians *ill only say that these are matters of fact which will be proved or dis proved when the trial takes place. As a preliminary I am asking Fowle ^or more precise information about the nationality of all concernedo ITie owner, Haji Mohammed Hussein, is presum- n Kbweiti. The Hakhoda Muhammad Hussain is claimed as a Persian subject. 'Tie other membersof the crew are said bp the Iraqi Minister here to be Iraqi subjects.

Perhans*^he natioTiality of the Hurst coirald help ir» these enquiries* Nakhoda is, of course, + he important point* I am in the meanwhile asking the Foreipr Office for an opinion as to the position of all concerned in international law if the dhow really were smuggling. Would, for instance, th owner have a claim for redress afainst (a) the Persians (bj the Hakhoda, if the dhow were seized either as a punl^ive measure or to help pay any fines that might he imposed on the crew (iln this case reduced to the Hakhoda). ‘Hie owner of the goods, whether innocent or guilty, presumably has no redress except against the Nakhuda (asuming dhe Hakhoda to he guilty)- or the woner of the dhow* The exten* to which 1 car presw for the return of the dhow depends upon the answers, I am asking Wilkinson at Ahwaz to arrange that Channcy s k * 11 e P Hurst informed of any local developments* Could you ask Hurst to reciprocate? Also would it *e possible for enquiries to be made of the control vessel near to which the dhow r/as anchored at the time of capture.

Copy So.375/3-9 , Dear Consulate, March 2nd, 1933. iw &lt; r Our despatch So.5 of February 3rd enclosing a copy of a note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the arrest of a Kuwait dhow in the Shatt-el-Arab while on its way to Fao. Will you please ask Mohammerah for copies of their telegrams Nos.4 and 5 to the Legation and any other papers necess ary to complete the story of the proceedings. We are still somewhat puzzled as to where the Persian authorities maintain that the dhow was at the time of its capture. If it was really and truly in the Bahmanshir river, then it was indisputably in Persian territorial waters (or to be more exact in Persian national waters): even if it was somewhere off the mouth of the Bahamshir it was probably in Persian territorial waters. Equally if it was aground somewhere in the ^&gt;hat t-el-Arab it would in the nature of things be 'above low water mark' and so in Persian territorial waters. So far so good. What puzzles us is the mention of Gusba. Gusba (presumably the same as Kasba on the Admiralty Charts)is upstream from Fao and if a dhow with a cargo manifested for Fao were found in the vicinity it would doubtless afford strong grounds for presuming that it was there for some ulterior purpose (though that would not justify the Persians in interfering with it outside the narrow strip of water along their own shore which lies between that shore and the low water line). The real difficulty is the phrase 'between Gusba and the Bahroanshir in Persian territorial waters'. The area in question covers the whole of the iihatt-el-Arab from Gusba to the sea/ ? Majesty’s Consulate, AHWAZ. •' crk '^ 0 ~ r&gt; t ^ Jk ' vge&amp; and except for th.e strip mentioned above, which, is probably never more than a few feet wide, there are no ’’Persian territorial waters” in the °hatt-el-Arab. If on the other hand it was round the corner of Abadan Island in the mouth of the Bahraanshir there does not seem to be much point in mentioning tfusba. It would be as easy to say” between Fao and the Bahmanshir” or between ”Abadan Beacon and the Bahmanshir”. Of course the dhow may have been up one of the creeks that run into knd across Abadan island, in which there would be no doubt that it was in Persian territory. We should be very grateful if you could clear up some of these points with Mohammerah, without if possible saying anything to the Persian authorities* We have to be very careful about anything that suggests a Persian claim to territorial waters in the Shatt.

To His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad al-Jabir as-Sabah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Ruler of Kuwait. After compliments, With reference to the small Kuwaiti dhow belonging to Hajji Muhammad Husain, nakhuda Muhammad Hasan, which according to Your Excellency’s report to me was saized early in December last by the Persians near the t mouth of the Shatt al-Arab and taken to Gusba. 2 . I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, has written and asked me to find out and report the exact nationality of each member of the crew of the dhow, and in particular that of the nakhuda. 3. This information is required because the Persian Government claim the nakhuda Muhammad Hasan, who is still in prison, to be one of their own subjects, while two of the sailehrs Ahmad Husain and Muhammad bin Feelow are said by the ’IRAQ Government to be ’IRAQIS, who have their homes at FAO. 4. It may interest Your Excellency to know that the case of the captured dhow is being taken up vigorously by His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran, who also has the of the British Ambassador in Baghdad, seeing that the Persian Government had no right to have a Police Launch in the Shatt al-Arab, and still less right to capture and convey a Kuwait dhow up the river which is in ’IRAQ terri tory, as far as Gusba.2 6 , In order to strengthen the British Minister in Tehran's hands therefore, and according to the instructions given me by the Hon'ble the Political Resident , I would ask Your Excellency to kindly make very careful enquiry into the matter, and let me have full information on the follow ing points (a) The nationality of Muhammad Hasan. (b) The names and nationality of the crew (4 persons in all). (c) The nationality of Yousif bin Shaheen the owner of the captured cargo. Usual ending.

COPY (S 1603/1524/91} FOREIGN OFFICE,S.W.l &lt;1 27th April 1933. My dear Hoare, In your letter No.375/3-13/3 of the 11th March about the Kuwaiti dhow which was recently seized by the Persians in the Shatt-el-Arab, you asked for a legal opinion on the points outlined in your letter of the same date to Humphrys. 2. We notice that the most important point in the whole case, namely the question whether or not the dhow was arrest ed in Persian waters, is still a matter of some doubt, and that further investigations are being made. Our information, too, is still incomplete as the India Office have not yet had ✓ any report on the subject from Bushire* ^ 3. In the meantime, however, we assume that for the purposes of your enquiry the relevant circumstances can be summarised as follows: a vessel belonging to a huwaiti, manned by Iraqis under the captaincy of a Persian is captured by Persian officials in Persian waters on a charge of smuggling, and this charge is proved against her in a P e rsian court . 4. In the circumstances described above, we are informed by our legal advisers that there would be no ground for protest provided ^a) that the proceedings were regular in accordance with Persian law, including any penalties which were inflicted, lb} that no objection to the proceedings could be taken on the ground that elementary principles of justice had not been followed, and '(c) that the treatment of the accused in the matter of their imprisonment etc. had not been unduly harsh.- 2 - C\ 'rij to- Oil lo 5 # We notice from the enclosures in Hump hr ys k letter to you of the 3rd March iNo.193/7/33) that the Persian officials are stated to have destroyed the papers which would have formed the most important evidence in favour of the accused, and to have detained the crew of the dhow for nine days without food. Both these statements seem to provide grounds for protest, but it is of course very doubtful Jihether it would be possible to substantiate them, and only too likely that the Persians would resort to flat denial. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter, together with a copy of your letter ^without its enclosures) to Humphry s at Bagdad. Yours ever, (Sgd.)

Sir, n l I have the honour to forward, for your information translation of the following letters:- (a) Letter No.R/3/1163, dated the 7th Jamad Awal 1352 (28th August 1933) from His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait to myself with enclosures as below: r (b) Letter dated 3rd Jamad Awal 1352 (24th August 1933) from Seyed Abdul Latif al Gharabally (Arab), master of a Kuwait water dhow, to His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait; Wy' s* * (c) Letter, dated 4th Jamad Awal 1352 (25th August 1933) from a certain Mohamed al Saqar at Fao (Arab) to Seyed Malik al- Gharabally, the owner of the dhow. 2* The letters speak for themselves and require lit tle comment, except that where the nakhuda Abdul Latif al Gharabally talks about 'Officers” of the Persian River patrol having led the party, which seized his ship, we might I think, understand, 'sergeants' (Shaoushes). They were quite clearly men in authority, but as the local Arab knows little or nothing of Persian badges of rank etc., the peti tioner prefers (excusably, I think) to call them 'Officers'* 3* The incident I consider to be a serious one, as from/- E - from what the Shailch tells me, it was a ease of common piracy on the part of two regular Persian River Police officials, assisted by two of their men and two boatmen (ballamchis) obviously in league with them. 4 # lliat robbery pure and simple, was the intention, may, I think, be assumed from the contents of 1(c) above, which, if true, shows that the Hais-i-iinnieh at Gusbah took immediate steps to arrest and deal with one of the culprits on the representation of Kohamed al Saqar of 'ao a friend of the Kuwait owner of the dhow. 5 # That an incident of this nature could happen on the much frequented part of the Ghatt al Arab, close uo FAO, where hundreds of river craft ply daily, and in broad daylight, reflects a serious state of affairs, and shows that all cannot be well with the ’Iraq River Police, who are supposed to be entirely responsible for law and order and the safety of the public, on this great inland waterway. 6. The ill mannered and insulting treatment accorded to the unfortunate nakhuda and crew of the Kuwait dhow, by the Police Inspector at ifao seems to confirm the fact that the latter felt his department had been guilty of neglect of duty somewhere, and in sheer annoyance vented his spleen on the dhows crew whose only fault apparently lay in report ing that they had been set upon and assaulted by Persian 'Official' pirates, acting much in the same way as Chinese river bandits would. 7, chile frcm the evidence to hand it seems fairly clear that the Persian Rais-i-iaanieh at Gusbah did his best to bring the culprits to book, as soon as he heard of the incident, the moral and physical hurt suffered b. : , tho inno cent crew of the Kuwait Ihow, should not, X consider, allowed to pass without a demand for some form of compensa tion from the Persian Government. As regards this latter, 1/- 3 - I think it would not be unreasonable to ask for Hs.540/- or £40/-, which sum to be divided between the nakhuda and his crew in the proportion of 2 shares to the nakhuda and 1 share to each member of the orew. 8* At the same time, and if you see no objection to such course, I would suggest that a very strong protest be one© again made to the Central Persian Government at this fourth highhanded 'hold-up', within 8 months, of in nocent Kuwaitis craft engaged in their ordinary legitimate business, by Persian River Police, or Persian sloops, vide my No.870, dated 22nd December 1932, my Confidential i o.82 dated the 24th April 1935, and my Confidential No.116, dated the 4th June 1933, respectively. 9. It does not fall within my province, to ask why or under what excuse the iersians are maintaining iver Poliee on the l-hatt al Arab, which I always understand to he entirely an ’Iraq river, hut it does strike me that if the ’Iraq Government do not take action in the master soon they will find it difficult to eject Persian Police from the river, when eventually they wish to do so. 10* In conclusion might I ask that a copy of this letter, or possibly a separate complaint from you to his Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad be sent drawing attention to the wholly unnecessary rough treatment accorded to Kuwait nationals by the Inspector of Police at Pao. In the present case the biased actions of this^^k person on whom the Shaikh of Kuwait is relying to support his land Agent and strengthen his authority among his recalcitrant Fao fellaheen, are not such as to inspire one with con fidence. I have the honour to be, Sir, Tour most obedient servant, Lt.-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait. YSS.Translation of letter No^H/3/1165, dated the 7th Jaraad Awal 1S5B (28th August 1953) from His ISxcellency the Ruler of Kuwait to the Political Agent, Kuwait, ooo* After Compliments, I beg to forward, herewith, to Your Excellency * a letter, in original, from Seyed Abdul Latif al Gharabally a Kuwait subject, and nakhuda of a water^ ’’Bum’ 1 (dhow), from which you will learn of the illtreatment and violence, which he was subjected to by the River patrol officers of the Persian Government of Gusbah, when he was sailing up the Shatt al Arab, The treatment meted out by these patrol officers was, indeed, entirely inexcusable. Assuredly if the jj nakhuda had had any arms wherewith to defend himself, he wou] would have put up a determined resistance, and no doubt, a serious incident would have resulted, but the nakhuda (being unarmed) was wise, and practically endured all the insults and beatings which were put upon him. As he has stated in his letter, he reported the matter at the time to the Fao Government officials. Further, the owner himself, of the 'Bum' in Kuwait later, received a letter from a certain Mohammed al Saqar, a friend of his, residing at Fao from where Your Excellency will learn what was the end of the business. I request Your Excellency to be so good as to refei this matter to the authorities concerned, in order that the breach grow not wider (between the Persian Government and ourselves) for a repetition of such an incident will gravely affect the relations of both sides.

The reason of this letter is that I, Seyed Abdul Latif al Gharabally, Makhuda of a Bum owned by Seyed Malik al-3eyed Muhamed-al-Gharabally, sailed on Thursday (21st August) for the Shatt al Arab to transport water to Kuwait, when we got there I was tacking inside the Shatt to suit the direction of the wind, when someone in a 'Railam” (a small river boat), near the eastern bank started shouting at us. We were in the centre of the river at the time, and we were steering towards the Fao bank. The man shouted 'Ya abu Balam' (you owner of the ballam) heave to'. I shouted back, 'This is a water Bum’-, but he repeated his shouting, saying, 'You are so and so, lower your sail'. Our sail at the time was set full, and we kept it hoisted until we arrived at the Fao side of the river, we then lowered our sail and anchored* The ballam, with those in it, followed us, boarded our craft and ordered us to set sail for the other side(of the river). We asked the reason why they wanted us to invert our course, and they atonce began to strike us savagely with the but ends of their rifles, and with their fists. They forced our sailors to raise the anchor, and they beat us until we were compelled to hoist the sail, and they continued to strike and ill treat us, until we reached a point opposite 'Nahr-al- Michri' at Gusbah and then made us lower our sail and anchor. Next /They pretended to inspect the boat, and carried out a sham examination, but as we had nothing on board (except water tanks) they naturally were unsuccessful in their search. They, however, seized our provisions for the voyage 'Makla' which consisted of two iaqiyahs (8 lbs.) of sugar, a quarter of a aqiyah tea (3^ lbs) , the tobacco of the sailors; Rs.10/- and a watch from myself, and some old garments belonging to the sallorgg ( Cow(i2 - sailors. Bux seeing their intention was robbery we refused to let them remove the above articles from the dhow. There upon they accused us of having with us two Persian sailors. .&lt;e replied that we had no Persian sailors, except two whose origin was Persian but were now Kuwaitis having resided there many years. They then said, 'Either you give us your belongings, or you must all disembark and go to the courts w with us, together wit&amp; your things'. So, determined to see the matter out, 1 took the manifest f/ith me and went with them, as on the manifest was noted everything which had been / n with us. v*hen w© landed with them they proceeded to take us to a distant and lonely place, end when they saw that we had no intention of letting them out of our sight, they began to frighten my sailors by saying, 'If you get as far as the courts with us, they will conscript you as soldiers, and will give you no end of trouble'. and began anxiously and with tears to implore me to return. I told them not to be afraid, but they said that they did not want to go further, and if I wished to go alone, I could. As night was falling, and in view of their further threats, I feared I would be further beaten or even worse would befall tanks with water, and proceeded to the Fao Customs House, where we re nor tfAd the whole rnntter to the '01 r eetor of fhietnimja. My men became thoroughly frightened at this trick, me, so I decided to return with my men to our dhow. They (the River patrol) accordingly took everything from us enumerated above. Reaching the dhow we set our sail, filled up ourto the Inspector of rolice and explain the Blatter to him, the latter would not keep us waiting long. So we went to the Inspector and told him our story fully, and he replied, 'You are subjects of a forei^i Government, and I can have nothing to do with you'. We told him that we were advised to report to him by the Director of Customs, who had said that it was necessary to state our case to him. At this the Inspector sent us to the 00 tor to have our hurts examined. So we were in spected by the Doctor, who stated in writing that we had received a very severe beating His report we brought back to the Inspector. Then he began to inquire into the matter. He abused us and our parents ©t almost every sentence, and used other words highly insulting to our family honour, but when he saw that I was very upset at his goings on, he seemed to take more trouble with his enquiry, but continued to call us by bad names, between his writing down of our evid nee. At last he let us go and told me to come the next day, but when we returned to our boat, we found that the two of the crew left in charge had disappeared, and the rest had become so alarmed that I deemed it wise to sail away, lest they ©Iso desert# According to what I heard from some Gusbah people 1 A 0 had seen the capture of our boat, the names of the River Patrol Police, who took us, were as follows: One was named Muhammad, and the other Sha’aban. The Be were the officers. The other two they did not know. The crew of the balam con sisted or two men, one was called Pairoor and the other was a baldheaded person, mhom they could not identify. The total number in the ballam was 2 officers and two men, also the ballams crew of two men. ——— O O O———-6 ^ Translation of letter dated the 4th Jamad Awal 1552 (25.8#33.) from Mohammed al Saqar at Fao to Seyed Malile al Gharabally, the owner of the baat. — ooo-*-- After Compliments, I beg to infer Your Excellency regarding the treatment of your n B!M M , when she sailed back to Kuwait.

Mohammed Hossein, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that according to information lately received, Mohammed, a sailor, son of Kassan, resident at Kuwait and a Persian subject accused of having smuggled 40 bags of cane sugar and other goods from abroad into Persia, has been condemned and sentenced by order of the '’Sulhieh* Gourt (Court attend ing to petty charges) at Khuzestan, to one month correctional imprisonment and the payment of a certain cash penalty. This condemnation was in consequence of a confession of Mohammed the sailor, to having committed the act of smuggling, and in the Court of Appeal, on the basis of the same confession of the accused, the order of the first court has been confirmed. There remains, therefore, no doubt as to the malicious intention of the crew of the dhow. g s possibly the man’s name is 'Mallah* which is correctly translated ’sailor* auove: in that case read in two places Mohammed Mall ah 11 •CONFIDENTIAL. «ei8 Iftfiws.i.

Because the man’s surname happened to be rt Kharji (which literally interpreted means 'of Kharaj n ) the Persian Director of Customs on Kharaj Island apparently saw fit to arrest him on the ground that he was a iersian subject, and. subsequently ill-treated- him in the way described, with the result that a perfectly innocent third party’s cargo has become an almost total loss at iushire. „ / Sir I have the honour to forward translation of 3./3. In point of actual fact tile Nahhuda Mohamed All * Kharji, is a sub^sct of Kuwait, and. he and his family have been resident on the Island of Falaika, a Kuwait Possession,for the last hundred years. It is not denied that the man's ancestors originally came from Kharaj Island who number some thousand souls, but to-day they are all perfectly good Kuwait subjects, and are claimed as such by the Ruler of Kuwait in just the same way as he claims some ten thousand other persons of distant Persian origin who to-day reside in Kuwait Town. 4® Before sending on this case to you, I have gone to the trouble of sending for Ahmad bin Abdul Latif of the firm of Khalid bin Abdul ? Latif Brothers, who are the owners of the damaged cargo, now in the hands of the lersian customs authorities at Burhire, and have discussed the whole business with him and from every angle. The man a very respectable merchant told me that he had instructed a certain Mohamed passim Behbehani to act as his Agent in the matter, with instructions to try and get some sort of satisfaction out of the local Customs authorities, hut that he had little hope of anything resulting. 5« VThen I advised that he himself should try and get across to Bushire somehow and make his complaint person ally, he pointed out that it was so difficult for him to ent*r Persia and so doubly difficult for him to get away again, that he felt it was quite useless to try. This, in fact, is true, seeing that the Bushire Passport authorities do not accept a British Certificate of Identity, arguing that Kuwait belongs to Persia. The result is that as there is no existing machinery whereby a Kuwait subject can get to Bushire and back in the course of ordinary business, it becomes impossible, as far as I can see, for the principal injured party in the present case (the owner of the a confiscated cargo) to lodge/complaint at Bushire,or even3 - or even hope Tor just ice, ana it would appear to be equally J impossible for the second injured party, the Kuwait N ale hud a, to recover the value of his sailing craft, or even himself leave Bushire for his home, 6« In forwarding the above facts, I would ask that you be so good as to use your utmost endeavours to get (a) the Sambuk re leased (not a total wreck); (b) the Nakhuda sent back to Kuwait; (c) that portion of the cargo which was salved and is now in the hands of the Customs authorities, released and handed over to M©named passim Behbehani of Bushire. 7. I do not know whether Mohamed passim Behbehani has any chance whatsoever, of getting any damages out of the Bushire Customs authorities on the grounds of negligence but in any case I trust you will be able to see your way to put His Majesty 1 s Minister in Tehran in possession of the above facts with a view to his drawing the Persian Government’s attention to the high-handed methods of their Customs officials in the Persian Gulf. 8* I am sending a copy of this to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf and trust you will approve of my doing so. I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant Lt.-Colonel Political Agent, Kuwait.Translation of letter No*H/3/l456, dated the 28th Shauwal 1352 (13-2-34) from His Excellency Shaikh Sir iihmad al Jabir as—Sahah, ivaC.X.E#, G*S*i* } ^uler of I-uwait to the Political Agent, Kuwait, After Compliments, I enclose herewith two letters, in original, one from Kuhammed i-li Kharji, I'ekhuda of a sailing ship, and the other from Khalid bin Abdul Latif al Hamad &amp; Eros, ateubject of Kuwait. Hrom the statement of the Nakhuda you will be able to learn of the ill usage that befell at the hands of the Director of the Persian Customs at Kharag, which was directly the cause of his ship being wrecked, and his cargo being damaged end lost. We trust that you will look into this unjusti fiable ill-treatment and aggression on the part of the abovementioned Director (of Customs) and will submit the case to the Hon’ble the Political lesilent. Usual Ending.u Translation of a petition dated the g5th Shauwal 1358 (10.2*34) submitted by Khalid bin .abdul Latif al Hamad &amp; Bros., merchants of Kuwait, to His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait. We beg respectfully to inform Your Excellency that some days ago we chartered a sailing ship (Sambuk) belonging to a certain Nakhuda by name Mohamed all Kharji, resident of the Island of Falaika* (close to Kuwait) and loaded her with 400 bags of maize ex Basra and 551 baskets of dates from the Manyuhi district situate on the Persian side of the Bhatt-al-Arab. Having duly taken out his manifests from the Customs Houses of Gusba in Persia and Fao in ’Iraq, the ^ Nakhuda sailed for Yemen, but when he got out to sea, his ship began to yield under the strain of the wind, and he was compelled to seek shelter under the lee of Kharaj Island, which belongs to Persia. On his arriving there s grave act of injustice was inflicted upon him by the will local Director of Customs who resided there, as you/see from the Nakhuda’s letter, which we enclose, herewith for your perusal. Therefore, we beg to request that Your Excellency will kindly take up the matter against the abovernentioned Director, who unjustifiably interfered with our goods and property, and was directly responsible for the wreck of a ship chartered by us, and of very serious damage to our cargo at Bushire. *Note by Political A gent. Falaika Island belongs to KuwaitTranslation of letter dated Bushire the 17th Shauwal 1352 (2,2.34), from Nakhuda Muhamed Ali Khar ji, to Ahmad bin Abdul Latif (of the firm of Khalid bin Abdul Latif al Kamad and Bros,), Kuwait. After Compliments, Regarding the cargo of maize and dates belonging to you, which X had ta^en on board my ship at Ashar (Basra) and Manyubi (Persian side of Shatt al Arab) respectively, I beg to inform you that after we had pro ceeded with your agent Baqir bin Muhammad Husain gafar to both the Customs Houses at Gusbah and Pao, and had finished with both, and had got cur sailing papers (Manifests) from each place, the lersian 'Jewaz' for permission to export the dates was taken by your said Agent Baqir, and the two manifests only remaining with me. fie then sailed from the mouth of the Shatt-ai-Arc v on the night of the 28th Ramadhan, but shortly afterwards the wind became strong and the sea rough, and our ship could no longer withstand the waves. Barly morning found us near the island of Kharaj, and we were obliged to make for it and take shelter in its harbour. We reached there with difficulty and proceeded to land in oraar to take in some supplies from the town, but when we came ashore, we were asked by the Director of Customs to produce our 'Jewazes' but we naturally could not. We showed him, however, the manifest(taken at Kao) but he said that it was neither signed nor had any date, and that we must therefore proceed to Bushire and be examined. He next sent a soldier on board our ship, caused much trouble to us, and detained us five days at Kharaj. On the fifth day he embarked on . board our ship, together with the Governor of the Island, a Nakhuda, a steerer, and a soldier, and ordered us to proceed to Bushire. At Bushire I and my crew, less five left behind2 J A less five left behind to look after the ship, were forced to land and report to the Director of the Customs House, Bushire, who questioned us and argued with us on the manifest for three complete days, during which period we were detained on shore* At last he decided that the various items of our cargo should be counted, and said that we would have ie to pay all expenses incurred for lighters etc. Next we were compelled to take lighters and go out to the ship with an inspector from the Customs House. The cargo was then unloaded into the lighters, counted, and found to agree with the manifest; it was re-on barked on the ship, and we came a an ore agafcn on the 9th Bhauwal lb52 (25.1.34), Chen everything was reported to him (the Director) the latter asked us to pay 260 Karans and take out a certificate. As we had no money we asked his permission tc sell some dates and pay him the sum he asked for, but he refused, saying that first we should pay him the money. I and the crew with ouV small jolly boat, remained on shore not knowing what to do to get out of the plight we were in. On the night of 10th Shauwal (25.1.34) a hurricane came on to blow, and my ship dragged her two anchors, went ashore and was wrecked. At sunrise the five men left on board were picked up by a small boat passing by, and brought ashore in miserable state. Lighters then went out to save what they could of the cargo making it a condition that they would take half of whatever they saved, but what they did save was found to be badly damaged and is now lying in the Customs House. We reported the matter in full to the Customs authorities and to the time of writing have received no reply. Me also went to the British Consul and reported the matter to him from the beginning till the end. He gave us a certificate, saying that it would be better for the owner of the goods to come himself3 - to Bush ire) because he Is an Arab from Kuw ait and we can only help him, but not you, who are considered to_ b^_Persian oubject fron, Kharaj. Pleaae therefore coEie either yourself or send an agent on your behalf.

Sir, I am directed to refer to your letter Ko.C-36, dated the 28th February 1934 on the above subject. -- Hakhuda Mohd Ali has been interviewed by me personally and states that he is a Persian subject born of Persian parents on Kharg Island. It appears, therefore, that there can be little doubt that his nationality is Persian. The owner of the wrecked dhow, it has been ascertained, is a certain Rais Bassan of Dubai. This man has been resident in Dubai for some years but all the evidence available is that he, also, is a Persian subject. It is understood that Rais Hassan has represented the case .concerning his boat direct to the Persian authorities in Tehran. It would appear, therefore, that the only way in which this Residency could intervene in Hie matter would be on behalf of the owner of the goods who according to your t:. above quoted despatch is a British Protected Person. The owner of the cargo would be well advised,if he is unable personally to come to Bushire, to Iddge through an Agent a formal complaint with the Persian authorities here against the Persian Customs for compensation for the damage sustained by his cargo. If no satisfaction is obtained the question of this Residency taking up the matter further P- 2 - . lUT'UU CtttiisUL u.V i 'w u i further could then be considered. — Mearwhile the Hon*ble the Political Resident would be glad to receive any comments you may wish to make •o on the points raised above in this letter. l/LA Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

M 1 \D Sir ' , A '-I / ^ith r(^ference to your Ho.Hil, dated the 16th(?) ' May 1951, I have the honour to enclose herewith, translation a confidential letter ro.R4/l532, dated the Slot Hay 1954, from His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait to myself, Tihich I received recently in reply to your letter referred to above, copy (In translation) of which was sent to him for his canments etc* 3, The Shaikh tells me that he now feels that whatever he says about the Nakhuda’s nationality will be quite useless as the Persians will merely claim that the latter is a Persian subject under the law that T, Once a Persian, always a Persian', and will reject as absurd the Shaikh’s claim that he is a Kuwaiti* 3* The Shaikh therefore prefers now to take the line, that it does not matter to him whether the Kakhuda is a Persian or not, his major and chief concern is the treatment of the cargo of a pure Kuwaiti citizen, of which latter there can be no doubt* 4* The Shaikh, you will observe, says that even if the Kuwaiti owner were present and desired to go across to Bushire and lodge a complaint against the Persian customs authorities, he, as the roan’s Shaikh, would not allow himallow him to go near the Persians, but would insist on hisi/T complaining to the Hon’ble the Political Resident only. As the owner is however away and his young brother fears to go to Bushire, the Sheikh (although he puts this badly in his leti-er) prays that the Political Resident kindly take up his subject's case direct with the Persians, both on behalf of the absent owner and on behalf of himself the 3ha i kh of Kuwai t * 5. I have few comments to make except that I think the Shaikh's plan the only practical method to follow, see ing that no Kuwaiti, let alone the owner of the goods in the case, will dare to go across to Bushlre and nut himself in the power of the Persians. The fear they have of the v latter, and their utter la ck of confidence in getting justice will definitely prevent such a move. 6, It may surprise you to hear this, but the belief is, I regret to say, also prevalent, that there is actual danger to life for a Kuwaiti to go over to Persia and lodge a compleint against a Oovemnont Department.

His advice (in other circumstances) is worthy of being acted upon, but the actual owner of the cargo, is for the time being absent at Aden, and the only person present, a brother of his, is reluctant to proceed to Bub hire, because he knows nobody there.

Dear Consulate-General, The Persian Government have recently approached us verbally about the dhow incident in which the nakhuda slipped the cable at Bander Dilate and sailed with two Persian customs guards on board to Kuwait and which you first reported to us in your telegram No.36 of March 2nd, 1934. 2. We do not propose to take any action in this matter unless the Persians approach us again but, as there are various discrepancies between the story as received from you and the somewhat garbled account given to us by the Persians, we should be glad if, for our information, you could confirm (a) that the dhow was Persian and not Kuwaiti, as stated by the Persians, and (b) that the nakhuda was a Persian or, at any rate, not a Kuwaiti. 3. We should also be glad to know what be came o f the cargo of the dhow. According to the nakhuda^ statement this consisted of sugar, which agrees with what the Persians say, but they go on to allege that it was sequestered by the Shaikh of Kuwait, who gave a receipt for it which was brought back by the two customs guards. 4. This we consider a little unlikely as, had it been so, we feel we should have heard more about the receipt.

No doubt it had already been landed before the Persian Customs boarded it and seized part of it (probably the balance still to be landed). 4. In my letter C.60 of 20th February 1934 to H.M’s Vice- Consul, Mohammerah, and para 2, I see that I implied that the rice cargo was still on board when the boat was seized by the Persians, and when she returned to Kuwait. I am quite prepared to admit, however, that the Shaikh’s present version is far more likely to be the correct one, for I wrote my original2 :- despatch in some haste, as will be seen from para 9 of my letter to H.M f s /ice~Consul, and I had only hearsay evidence to go on.

V- fa My dear Fowle, Will you please refer to your despatch No.9/B ©f Eay 25th last about the incident in which two Iranian customs guards were kidnapped on board a dhow and taken to Kuwait ? It rather looks from the copy of the letter from Dickson to the Shaikh of Kuwait, enclosed in your despatch, as though he had sent the Shaikh an actual copy (or rather translation )of Chancery letter to the Residency of March 5th. Of course I quite realise that he may not have sent an absolutely full and literal translation 5 but as a general principle it strikes me as wrong that letters etcetera which we write each other should be passed on textually to Shaikhs. In the ^resent case I don't in point of fact think it matters much, if at all; but, as I say, I don't feel that the principle of it is right. Perhaps you'd let me know sometime how you feel about it yourself. sd. Knatchbull-Hugessen.This Residency Printed Letter No.3761 dated the 51st August 1955 Description of Enclosure. Name and Date.

On the 10th Rabi Auwal 1355, corresponding to the 31st May 1936, he sent it to his agent at Qusbah, Ibrahim bin Jamma 1 . The Nakhuda remained working the 'balam' at the Iranian end under the supervision of the abov©mentioned agent. In the meantime there cam© someone who made a false report to the Customs authorities to the effect that the said 'balfam' was not the property of Khalifah, but that of Ibrahim bin Jamma* , the agent. They, therefore, seized the 'balam' and arrested the agent, on whom they imposed a fine of Iranian Riyals 1700 and three months 1 imprisonment. As the 'balam* is built in Kuwait, and we know that it belongs to Khalifah, we write this to you with the request that you will submit the question to the authorities concerned in order to take up the case of the said 'balam*. The rt balam rt is no doubt the property of Khalifah. It left Kuwait empty, on the date quoted above. / Khalifah intended to use it during the date season, because he owned date gardens at Qusbah.

After compliments, I have received your esteemed letter of the 1st instant (Rajab) (17.9,36), been pleased t o hear that you are well and understood everything you said therein. Regarding the ‘’balam 1 ' , you mentioned Mulla Salihs query about the case: As soon as I reached Qusbah the Rirectoi of Customs imposed a fine of Krans. 1700/- on the 'balam”, and three months* imprisonment on the agent I brahim bin Jamma*. ¥e, however, did not accept his decision and approached the^. Director of Mohammerah, who saw the papers of the ,, balam tt . Having ascertained that they were registered both at Fao and Qusba, he issued an order for the release of Ibrahim bin Jamma* and blamed the 'Director of Qusba for his action. But he said he was unable to release the 'balam' except after communicating with the authorities at Tehran, which he did. He, however, said that if we required the 'balam' we could have it on the payment of Krans.3280/- until pardon was received from Tehran, when our money will be refunded to us. Otherwise the 'balam* would remain in detention until a result was heard from Tehran. We chose the latter. We asked for a certificate from the Rao Customs, but they said that they neither register nor tax small boats whose capacity is below ten tons. As for Port and Customs papers, I myself saw them with the Director of Mohammera#. 1 also saw the Quabah permit there. I am awaiting your eply reply. In the meantime you may inform Mulla Salih of the situation, and ask his opinion whether communication s hould start at once or after a reply is received from Tehran. His opinion will give satisfaction.

The file consists mostly of correspondence between the Political Agent, Kuwait, and various British diplomatic officials. Most of the correspondence concerns the circumstances of the seizures and the nationalities of the crew members.One particular case relates to a Kuwaiti dhow that was destined for Fao [Al Fāw] with a cargo of sugar and groceries, and was reportedly seized in the Shatt al Arab by Persian customs. The correspondence regarding this incident, which took place on 6 December 1932, is concerned with confirming the nationalities of the dhow's crew members and whether or not the dhow was seized in Persian or Iraqi waters. Another case involves the abduction of two Persian customs guards, who were taken by force to Kuwait on a Persian dhow carrying contraband sugar.The principal correspondents in the file are the following:Political Agent, Kuwait;Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire;Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire;British Minister, Tehran;British Consul, Mohammerah [Khorramshahr];British Vice-Consul, Mohammerah;British Consul for Khuzistan, Ahwaz;HM Ambassador, Baghdad;Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs;British Legation, Tehran;Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir as-Sabah [Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ].The file includes a circular letter, distributed by the Political Agent, Kuwait, to the Political Resident and to the other Political Agents in the Gulf, which requests certain details (such as date, place, name and nationality of vessel) in all reports regarding seizures of dhows, in order to assist the Political Resident in his communications with the Persian Government.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Khorramshahr</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Vice-Consul, Khorramshahr</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign Secretary</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Ahwaz</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Diplomacy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Customs policy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Sailing vessels</topic></subject><subject><topic>Detention</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000099#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
