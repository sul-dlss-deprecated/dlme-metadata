Colonel Abraham of Burmah Oil Company now in Delhi has a sked us whether we have any objection to his cabling to Company’s London Office asking them to get in touch with you immediately and to request you to cable sanction to Watts for negotiations by them for a prospecting licence over Jabal Mehdiq area within Muscat territory to be started with Sultan before he leaves Bombay on November 30th. 3. Abraham’s reason for consulting us was that Company’s Agents in Baluchistan have been informed by Parsons that applications for Eastern part of Jebel Mehdiq within Kalat territory could not now be con sidered as consideration of any such application would automatically raise the question of undemarcated bound ary between Muscat and Kalat territory and he thought it most undesirable that this question should be raised at the present time. 4. We have not had time to consult Baluchistan but we consider it desirable that Burmah Oil Company which is a British concern should be given a chance of obtain- ing a concession at Gwadur before Sultan leaves onMM(g) \% his tour in the course of which especially in America he may be approached by other interests. In any case we did not think that we could legitimately object to Company’s submitting an application to you at once if they wish to do so and we have informed Abraham accord 5. The only references to boundary question we have so far been able to trace will be found in 2nd and 7th paragraphs of Political Agent Muscat’s letter which form No. 152/S of 10th May 1920, a copy of which was forwards 22nd JUly 1920, It is perhaps unlikely that boundary question will be raised in an acute form unless oil is are doubtful whether we can deprive the Sultan of a possible source of revenue purely owing to e xistence of an undemarcated boundary and possible trouble we may be put to in arranging for its demarcation, V'e will let you know if we find it necessary to modify our views. Meanwhile we suggest that Company should be permitted to negotiate v/ith Sultan with a warning that they may eventually be compelled by existence of boundary question to withhold their approval of any agreement reached. ingly. ed an enclosure to Deputy Political Resident’s letter M ed to you under Foreign Secretary’s letter No. 60-M of discovered in commercial quantities but in any case we are however consulting Baluchistan on this point and FOREIGN86/22 Telegram Q From political Resident, at Bahrain.

Political Agent, Muscat* No*2809 Dated 26th received 27th November 1337 IMMEDIATE Your telegram No.2309 November 25th Ballantyne (the London representative of the Standard Oil Company of California) approached us on (?) 25th November with an enquiry whether His Majesty T s Government would have any objection to his Principals negotiating with the Sultan of Muscat for an oil concession in Gwadur. He stated that the Sultan had at an earlier date informed HAMILTON representing California Company that he would welcome an offer from that Company. Gwadur is expressly excluded from both Concessions recently obtained by Petroleum Concessions Limited presumably because latter were not interested in that area. Ballantyne informed us that steps were being taken for formation of a private company - Indian Oil Concessions Limited - representing fifty percent American and fifty per cent British Indian interests with a view to applying for oil rights in certain parts of India and he mentioned the MEKRAN - as one of the areas in mind. He added that even if Gwadur was without oil possibilities his Principals would still be interested in that place from point of view of its use2 . V* use as a port in the event of the group referred to obtaining oil rights in Baluchistan. As it was clear that CALIFORNIA Company's enquiry regarding Gwadur was incidental to main proposals of indiafrOjl Concessions Limited I considered it best to postpone consulting you on former until latter had been communicated to you in India. I understand that this has now been done (though I do not know whether any specific application in respect of areas in Baluchistan has yet been made by Indian Oil Concessions Limited). in deciding to postpone consulting you on Ballantyneis enquiry I was of course unaware that Burma Oil Company were also taking an interest in Gwadur. If Burma Oil Company are prepared to submit an application to Sultan it is I think clear that California Arabian Standard Oil Company (especially as their enquiry was a few days earlier) should equally be | allowed to do th$ same so far as Gwadur is concerned. This may result in Sultan 1 s getting better terms from the eventually successful applicant. But there does not seem to be any urgency such as to necessitate applications being made to Sultan before he leaves India. I suggest that both companies should be informed that they may submit applications through the Political Agent in due course and that if Sultan before he leaves India is informed of # Burma Oil Company* s interest in the matter he should also be informed of that of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company.

Present position is that Certificate of Approval has been applied for on behalf of new Company India Oil Concessions enabling them to negotiate with Khan of Kelat and other authorities in Mekran. Application is still being considered. Gwadur has not been mentioned in conversations or correspondence. Burma Oil Company who received Certificate of Approval some years ago have made formal application through Political Agent, Kalat, for prospecting concession over large area of Mekran which is under consideration. 4# T ' r e agree with you therefore that Sultan whould be informed by ^atts at once that both Companies are anxious to negotiate for concession in Gwadur. You suggest that California Company through Hamilton approached Sultan direct some time ago so we consider that Burma Oil Company should also be permitted to if they wish to discuss matter informally2 *3 with. 3ultan through their representative in India. We also agree that both Companies may be informed that they may suomit applications through the Political Agent in due course.

The quest ion/-i3 quiation of tho boundary would presumably be raised just as much by an application to the Sultan for the Western portion as by an application to Baluchistan for the east ern portion, and before taking any action on the lines of P&amp;nigraph 2(d) above 1 should like to be assured that suoh action would not meet with the disapproval of the Govern ment of India* 4* I ought to add that Watts is under the impression that I am today cabling London on the lines suggested by him* It was only after further consideration of the implications and possible consequences of this action that 1 decided that I ought first to put the matter before your Department* 1 tried to get Wafts on the telephone this morning to lot him know that I v?as doing this, but failed* from the Resident, Persian Gulf, indicatin v that the correct procedure now is an approach to the India Office in London* If I do not now cable, such an approach will presumably fce made by our London Office in a week or two - but by that time the Sultan will heve left Jombay* 5.

Sir, ?. 10 S' In reply to Major Hay's letter No.F.564-N/37, dated the 30th November 1937 I have the honour to s a y that Colonel Parsons left no record from which it is possible to con elude what were his exact reasons for holding that it is undemarcated boundary between Gwadur and halat* I learn objections in the course of his meeting with the represen tatives of the Burmah Oil Company. have been influenced by the fact that there is at the pre sent time considerable friction between the Kalat and Muscat States, due to a divergence of interest in the master of control of the trade which uses Gwadur as a base to serve the hinterland of Mekran and adjacent parts of Iran. It is believed that His Highness the Sultan of Muscat in the course of his recent visit to Delhi raised objection to the duties which the Kalat State authorities impose on goods imported via Gwadur, on the ground that such goods are subjected to a double duty, namely a Gw a dur transit tax and a Kalat import duty. On the other hand, as the Government of India are aware, the K a lat State in their turn wish to develop undesirable to raise at present time the question of the ■ «ir i r - - -- I, .i him. in*——wrriirw~n'TTrrnr~~nT«‘T‘rr*~~TT~i'»i*~ i, .i m ii.i ^n MTrnrr^'nti *r moreover that he did not think it necessary to explain his 2, It occurs to me, however, that his attitude may their/• 5 ^ their own port at Jiunri as a rival to Gwa&amp;ur, and have approached the British India Steamship Company with a re quest that the Company’s steamers may call at that port, the object being to ^ avoid the transit duty imposed by the Muscat State at d-wadur. Col. Parsons may, xsxxxxx perhaps, h^ve thought that any development scheme or concession rais ing the question of demarcation of the ha- 4 -at “bwadur border would be inopportune in view of the trade disputes which have arisen between the two States. Prom such knowledge as I possess of this matter I am inclined t o agree with this view and in particular to doubt whether an oil con cession, part of which would be in ; uscat territory and part in adjacent Kalat territory, could be easily worked, un til the authorities of the two States have arrived at a reasonalble compromise regarding other matters in dispute along the Mekran coast. 3. The matter is one on which the Government of India will no doubt wish further to consult the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, of whose views I should be glad t be informed • I have etc., Sd/- O.K.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter N0eEe564-N/37, dated the 22nd December 1937, asking for ay comments on tne application by the Bunaah Oil Company for a prospecting license in Gwadur* 2# The situation appears to be that there are two oil Companies in the field for the Gwadur concession i*e. tne Indian Oil Concessions Ltd* representing 5&lt;&amp;&gt; American and SOfi British Indian interests (vide paragraph 2 of India Office telegram No.2809 of tne 26th November 1937), and the Burraan Oil Company Ltd*, which is of course a British concern* It is presumably preferable from our point of view that the latter should be given at least an equal charvce of obtaining the concession* 3* I appreciate Mr* Caroe 9 s general arguments that previous to the giving of a concession it would be better for tne two States of Kalat and Muscat to come to a reasonable compromise over their trade differences and also to demarcate their v frontier. The following, however, has to be borne in mind. Though the Sultan cannot actually give an oil concession to any Company /Company without the approval of the Government of India (aee Undertaking by the Sultan of Jtuaoat regarding oil W23 at page 319 of Aitoheeon*a Treatiea Volume XI) there ia notnin e to prevent the Company atarting negotiat Iona with iiia Hignneaa. If, therefore, we were to try and reatrain tne Burmah Oil Company ltd., who aa an entirely Britieh Company may be more under our influence than their rivale, from opening negotiatlone i»ith the Sultan, there ia nothing to prevent Indian U Concea- alone Ltd. from approaching him. Thie tney mignt do tnrougn the Standard Oil Company of California during hie highness's tour either in America or in England. 4. On the balance of advantages, therefore, ! am in favour of allowing both Companies to negotiate with tne Suitan forth with, and I auggeat that they should be informed accordingly. a 5.

The next step will be for me to inform both Companies that they may submit applications for concessions through^^ ^ the Political Agent (see paragraph 5 of your telegram No.2326 of the 27th November); but as the Sultan has now started on his world tour there is no urgency about this and it may be /f preferable to defer doing so until we have the result of your enquiries ,about the boundary question (see paragraph 5 A' '7 of your telegram 2309 of the £5th November and your letter to Baluchistan of 30th November). / 2. If there should appear to be a serious difficulty about the boundary the communication to the Companies would be suit-'' arded. As regards the suggestion however in the las nee of your telegram of the 25th November, would it ndt be sufficient, instead of expressly telling the Companies that ’‘Government may eventually be compelled by existence of the boundary question to withhold their approval of any agreement reached”, to say merely that ’’they may submit applications through the Political Agent on the understanding that any concessions granted by the Sultan will be subject No - P.Z. 7968/37. to/(Continuation Sheet.) EXPRESS LETTER (AIR MAIL). to the approval of His Majesty's Government”. Such approval is required by the terms of the oil undertaking given in 1923 by the Sultan's predecessor (see Aitchison Vol.ll - Part III - No.XX). It will in any case be desirable to make the communication to the Companies subject to this understanding, and if there is a difficulty about the boundary question this would then be one of the factors to be considered in due course in arriving at a decision v/hether to give approval.

January, 1938. The Under-Secretary of State for India, India Office, Whitehall. Sir, We have the honour to inform you that we recently applied for a licence to prospect for petroleum over an area of approximately 42 square miles in the neighbourhood of Gwa dar. At that time we believed that the whole ox this area lay v/ithin the territory of the Sultan of Muscat, and our ^ •» b * application was addressed to the Political x^esixenu, Persian Gulf, Bushire. Later, it appeared that about 8.5 square miles of this area lay in the Kalat State, Baluchistan, and an application for this portion was submitted to the Political Agent, Kalat and Chagai, Sibi, the application addressed ^ to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, being revised to include the balance of approximately 33.5 square miles. We were informed by the Baluchistan authorities that the boundary of the territory of the Sultan of Muscat was not accurately defined and that it was undesirable to raise the question of demarcation of the boundary at the present time. Since that question would irevitaoliy oe raised by the granting of the desired prospecting license, they did not propose to grant a concession to us or to any other party over the area in question.The Under-Secretar.y of State for India. 5.1.38. With regard to the remainder of the area we received a communication from the Ofiiciating rolitical Resident in the Persian Gulf, informing us that the procedure governing an application for a prospecting licence or an oil concession in Muscat territory is di^ierent from that in force in India and recommending us to approach the India Office in the matter. At about this time the Sultan of Muscat, accompanied by the Political Agent, Muscat, visited Delhi and some preliminary conversations took place there between the latter and a representative of this Company. In tnese conversations we were again recommended to obtain sanction from the India Office to the opening of negotiations with the Sultan, but as the Sultan was then on the point of starting on a tour to Japan and the U.S.A., the matter was not pursued further at that time. Since the grant of such a concession by the Sultan of Muscat would euually raise the boundary issue we now have the honour to enquire. (a) whether there would be this similar objection to the opening of negotiations with the Sultan for the area in question; (b) if not, what would be the correct procedure to a dopt (c) if yes, whether we may rest assured that pending settlement of the boundary issue no other application will be considered and that when tne way is clear we could look to His Majesty 1 s Government and to the Government ox India for support in our own relative negotiations. 7/e have, etc., THE BURMAH OIL COMPART LIMITED.

Application by the Burmah Oil Compajiy Limited for a prospecting license in G-wadur* Please refer to our official letter to you No.F.564-N/ 37, dated the 22nd December 1937 • 2* It seems desirable to make some attempt to settle the outstanding differences between Kalat and Muscat not only on account of the applications which have been received for oil concessions in the Jabal-i-Mehdi area, but also on the general grounds. It has been suggested that a meeting might be arranged between representatives of the two States in the presence of the Political officers concerned for the purpose of reaching an amicable settlement. I am desired to enquire whether you consider this practicable. 3. One of the difficulties is the difference of status between Muscat and Kalat.

From his side there could be no loss of dignity, as Kalat has 19 guns against Muscat’s 21, while,Muscat is an independent Principality. I would suggest however that (a) the Wazirs of each State should be included, (b) the meeting should be on neutral ground, e.g. at Karachi, and (c) a very careful agenda should be drawn up with th idea of arriving at some definite conclusions.

GWADUR OIL CONCESSION. required to pursue negotiations in Muscat has been frustrated by Sultan* s approach in London to Indian Oil Concession Limited presumably in consequence of contact made by him with Standard Oil Company in America. It was considered impossible to prevent Company discussing matter with Sultan and consequently Burma Oil Company were informed that they also were free to approach Sultan in London. Both Companies were reminded of position explained to them in letter dated 31st January viz. that Sultan was under obligation ; to grant concession without approval of Government S 14 and that in considering whether permission could be given His Majesty*s Government would have to take into consideration boundary difficulties between Gwadur and Kalat. Companies have been allowed to mcki offers 2 Original intention that Companies should be to/2 to Sultan and Indian Oil Concessions have sought permission to conclude an agreement which would contain a clause indicating that agreement or concession takes effect only when approval has been given by His Majesty 1 s Government. 3. Sultan left this country on May 1st on conclusion of his second unofficial visit. Matter may therefore remain as at present till he returns to Muscat, though there is a possibility that Companies may in the meantime wish to continue discussions with him direct or through a represent ative. Both Companies have been asked to refrain from concluding any agreement or concession until terms have been approved by Government. 4. I should be grateful if you could let me have your views very urgently on attitude to be adopted in regard to further progress of negotiations and with particular reference to boundary question. What is present position in regard to the latter ? I may add that I understand both C ompanies are apply- -ing for a concession in respect of Sultan 1 s territories in Gwadur without any more detailed specification. Also Sultan has recognised orally that if a concession is granted it will then be necessary to proceed with de- -marcation of frontier. In these circumstances 1 should be glad to know whether you consider difficulties connected with boundary justifies us in continuing to refuse permission to even a conditional agreement with Sultan as described at end of paragraph 2 above. - RETAXAHDUM -fo Tele ^ram From To Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, Simla.

(a) Some sort of small boundary commission will pre consist of the Political Agents Muscat and Ralat,' and representatives of the Muscat and halat States, lb) In drawing up the terms of the commission a final Arbitral Authority will have to be included, to whose decision both States will submit, in case of dispute between the two States as to any section of the boundary which cannot be decided on the spot by the commission. Such disputes may well arise since, in the event of oil being found any where near the frontier, it may make considerable expeditious than the ordinary mad and is cheaper than the telegraph. It is intended to be treated^ on receipt, with the same expedition as if it had been telegraphed.

Arbitral authority mi&amp;kt be the Government of India. have little idea how long the commission will take over its labours. the frontier to be demarcated is not extensive, but there may be disputes to be settled. (d) It would I think save much time if before the commission actually met, the Survey Officer, referred to above, made an accurate may of the area through which the frontier would run. He could be accompanied by the State representatives who would ilater be members of the commission. J^or this purpose the Survey officer could start this preliminary work at Gwadur on the 1 st October, or whatever was considered a suitable date • (e) Re the expenses of the commission. I do not know what the ordinary procedure is, but as in this case the boundary is being demarcated for the benefit of the two States concerned, in order that they may con clude oil concessions, I suggest that they - the States should bear in equal proportions at least some of the expenses of the commission as well as that of the preliminary survey. ’ihis might take the form of sharing all expenses except the salaries of the Government of India Officers employed. 'tfiis will at least ensure that both States have a motive for expediting proceedings. 3 . It may be worth while mentioning that when I broached/7 ^ broachtd to the Sultan the subject of settling the frontier he was very firm on the point that he could have no direct relations with Kalat» but could only negotiate through His Majesty’s Government* 'Hiis ia f of course, quite correct, and for the present purpose / as Kalat is under the Government of India, it is through the latter that negotiations roust take place. 3d.

My dear Hay, X bJ-Mt* lu -'‘ /OJ# Please refer to your demi-official letter No .F.564-N/37, dated the 22nd December 1937. 2. Discussions with the Kalat State nave taken some little time, but I now enclose a copy of a letter from Edwards with enclosure, from which it will be seen that His Highness the Khan would not reiuse to enter into discussions with the Sultan of Muscat on these matters. 3. There is no ’blockade' of Dwadur from the land side but only a perfectly legitimate Customs Cordon. 4. The suggested compromise to which Edwards refers in his letter was to the effect that a joint duty on goods imported into G-wadur for consumption in the Kalat hinterland might be shared between the two States in an agreed proportion. 5. I do not myself however think tnat anything would come out of discussions between the two States, particularly now that it has been decided to transfer the flying boat base to Jiunri. The cards will now oe likely to be all in the Khan’s hands and he will see no reason to negotiate. Yours sincerely, 3d. A. E.3.Parsons.D.C.No .2298.

I enclose a copy of memorandum No.17-3., dated the 6th April 1933, from the Wazir-i-Azam, Kalat State. Having so recently taken charge of this Agency I find it difficult as yet to offer any useful opinion on the questions at issu but as His Highness is clearly prepared to enter in£to dis cussions on the subject, I am inclined to think that the compromise outlined in paragraph 2 of your D.O. letter No. 431/P., of the 13th January 1938 might form a very suitable basis for discussion. The main difficulties in the way of a final solution appear to be the uncompromising attitude of the Sultan of Muscat on the one hand and on the other the fact that the Kalat State, in their anxiety to attract trade to their own posts of Pasni and Jiunri, have little desire to give facilities which might encourage further trade through G-wadar. 3. On the information at present at ray disposal, it does not appear to be true that the Kalat State authori ties have established any ’•blockade” on t he G-wadar frontier Possibly the Sultan of Muscat was referring to the Kalat State customs cordon described in G-astrell’s D.0.:^o.368- (P.&amp; T. 14/36f of the 21st January 1938, which collects customs duty and transit fees on goods entering the Kalat State. 7 of the Wazir-i-Azam * s memorandum, I do not suggest that any representation need be made at present. I a:ii not yst m- 2 - in a position to estimate to what extent his allegations are justified; and on p rima facie grounds it seems that the existence of the Kalat State customs cordon should in itself afford a sufficient safeguard against any manifest encroachment. In any case, if a general discussion is initiated on the compromise basis, the Kalat State authori ties would doubtless find an opportunity then to ensure that any final agreement contains an adequate safeguard against encorachment by the Sultan of Muscat beyond dwadar limits. Yours sincerely, 3d/- C.Gr.N.Edwards. To Captain L.A.Cx.Pinhey, I.A., Secretary to the Agent to the Oovemor- 3-eneral in Baluchistan, Quetta. True Copy, Sd/- Illegible Superintendent, Baluchistan Secretariate. Copy of memorandum No.l?-S*, dated tne 6th April 1938 from the Wazir-i-Azam, Kalat State, Kalat, to the Political Agent, Kalat, Mastung. Subject:- Gwadur trade. Reference your telegram No.192 dated tne 3rd April 1938 and our discussion dated the 4th instant on trie above subj ect. 2. The situation regarding dwadur affairs is undoubted- ly very peculiar of its kind. Originally S-wadur vvas a part of Mekran territory in the Kalat State. In the 13th century i of dwadur port was bestowed upon one of the ancestors of the present Sultan of Maskat for his maintenance by the then Khan of Kalat. The remaining i share had neverbeen gifted by the Grichkis of Mekran who still possess such gift Sanads in which the then Khan of Kalat wrote to the Grichkis (ancestors of Nawab Fai Khan) that he had git ted i of his share of '3-wadur port to so and so for their naintenance* It is an admitted fact that Grwadur is a gifted property from the ancestors of the present Khan of Kalat and the gift is strictly confined to the Port area of Grwadur. 3* As regards the complaint made on his part regarding land customs that the Kalat State authorities are not allowing the traders to pass to G-wadur is devoid of facts. 4. The Kalat State has got at present two main 1 Sea Fortspasni and Jiunri along the Mekran Coast. These ports are visited by traders from the following localities:- • (1). From Kech Side-pay customs at Karwat and Talan£. (^)» Iranian traders coming via Pay customs at Mand and Tump. Suntsar. (3) Iranians border traders coming Pay customs at from Bahu side. ' Kalatak, Kuldan and Chatan. 0. It is in the interest of the traders from the above centres proceeding to Jiunri and Pasni that they are not charged any customs at the above mentioned posts, but when they proceed towards Gwadur a fair rate of customs is charged according to the old established rights. The majority of the traders in their own financial interest would naturally hesitate to proceed towards Gwadur where they have also to pay another austoms to the Wall of Gwadur besides the Kalat State dues; and therefore they prefer to go to Jiunri and Pasni rather than to Gwadur and return to their country by the same route. It is thus clear that the rights enjoyed by the Kalat State to levy land customs in her own territory are justified in every way and such rights could not be waived in favour of the Wali at Gwadur as a gifted property.6. I think personally the complaint made by the 7/ali against the Kalat State customs policy is only meant to conceal his activities which he is making in connection with the encroachment in the State territory. It is re ported to me by the Naib Wazir Mekran that the Wali is extending his influence along the Mekran coast and he has actually gone as far as Sur about 12 miles north east of Gwadur and then to Ban and Darbela along the coast while towards Kulanch about 30 miles in the interior of Kalat State and again towards our customs post at Suntsar about a distance of 3-4 miles from the post. He has started an encroachment gradually upon the State territory which will come to light very soon. In the light of circumstances, the Wali is an aggressor and the Kalat State is an aggrieved party, who cannot tolerate to see his encroachment in the State area likewise. In spite of all this if he is anxious to discuss on the subject, the Kalat State is prepared to receive him or his representative. 7. As regards his encroachment, it is requested that the Wali of G-wadur may kindly be asked to confine his activities to G-wadur Port only, otherwise there is every likelihood of a trouble between his men and the State people on the border, and which we never desire.CONFXDiiKTIAL. 8t/»* • &lt; 3 &gt; % I/.0.No«£b4-6* Tlxe hesiaency, BusHire, tne £5th May 1^6b* r f. yo Could you please refer to your* aemi-offictal letter No•D•lY£4*N/Bb, aatea 11th May 1^5d with enclosu, es on the subject of the settlement of outstanding questions between Muscat ana K&amp;l&amp;t* £• The most Important question Is tnat of tne frontier demarcation, which is already under consideration, vide ^ correspondence ending with Inaia Office telegram No*908, dated 19th May 19o6. 6* The other questions centre round the matter of customs dues.

Through a most unfortunate mistake it was opened in our Mails Branch, and, further, in opening it the enclosed letters were damaged. You will remember Ballantyne telling us that the Sultan resented very much the fact that the original offer from Indian Oil Concessions Ltd. had reached His Highness through the Political Agent. This would have added to our difficulty of convincing the Sultan that the opening of the present letter in the India Office had been purely accidental, and we therefore think it better to return the letter- to you for such action as you think fit. As the Burmah Oil Company have already entered/ ,*ble Lt.Col. Sir tchard Fowle, KCIE. , CBE. , H.B.M ! s Consul General, Bushire2 . entered into negotiations with the Sultan in London the failure to deliver the enclosed letter at this late stage can fortunately do the Company no harm. By the way, ought not the 'Sir” to he omitted from the Sultan’s title ? I should have thought its use was inappropriate, if not wrong, in the case of an independent Ruler. In view of what the Sultan said to_us in London about his title I feel sure he would object to the 'Sir'. As regards the addition of the letters M KCIS' we are advised by the Foreign Office that it is contrary to practice to insert the letters of a British decoration when addressing an independent Ruler, and we propose to inform Metcalfe, in a letter of which a copy will be sent to you, that there would be no formal objection to acceding to the Sultan’s wish, which he will presumably express again on his return, for the omission of the 'KCIE' in his form of address.Telegram From (£$) ‘ I or I r-&gt; Q ‘His Majesty^ Secretary of State for India, Londb n.

Dear Mr. Gray, Many thanks for your letter of the 28th April and for your kindness in keeping us so fully informed of your negotiations with the Sultan, We are now consulting the Government of India and are accordingly unahle at the moment to express any comments on the terms of your Company's letter of the 28th April to the Sultan. Pending receipt of the Government of India's views I should like to remind you of our desire, which I conveyed to you when you called on the 27th April, that your Company should not conclude any agreement or sign any undertaking with the Sultan until the terms of the concession have been approved by His Majesty’s Government. If at any time we should feel called upon to modify our attitude in this matter we will not fail to notify you at once. Now that the Sultan has left this country we presume that the discussions with him will remain dormant until he returns to Muscat, when they can be resumed (the Political Agent can then be kept in touch in accordance with our letter of 31st January last). Yours sincerely, Sgd. J.P.

I confirm that it is understood by us that we will not conclude any agreement with the Sultan or sign any undertaking with him until the terms of the concession have received the approval of His Majesty's Government and I will particularly draw the attention of our representative in India to the point. The position at the moment is that we have not received from the Sultan any acknowledgment of our letter of 28th April, and since he has now left this country, I imagine that we shall hear nothing more until he has returned to Muscat. Our representative in India will then endeavour to establish contact with him through the Political ^gent, and will also keep in touch with the Political Department of the Government of India.

AND GOD TS GRACIOUS.INDIA OFFICE, p,Z. 3054/38. WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 4th May, 1938. Dear Mr. Ballantyne, Many thanks for your letter of the 28th April and for your kindness in keeping us so fully informed of your negotiations with the oultan. We are now consulting the Government of India and are accordingly unable at the moment to express any comments on the terms of your draft concession. Pending receipt of the Government of India’s views I should like to remind you of our desire, which I conveyed to you when you called on the 27th April, that your Company should not conclude any agreement or sign any undertaking with the Sultan until the terms of the concession have been approved by His Majesty's Government. If at any time we should feel called upon to modify our attitude in this matter we v/ill not fail to notify you at once. Now that the Sultan has left this country we presume that the discussions with him will remain dormant until he returns to Muscat, when they can be resumed (the Political Agent can then be kept in touch in accordance with our letter of 31st January last). Yours sincerely, Sgd. J.P. Gibson. •tFi. Ballantyne, Esq. , Britannic House, Finsbury Circus, E.C. 2.Extract from note of interview with the Sultan on 27th April. x x x x x Sir Trenchard Fowle then referred to the negotiations which were taking place in London with Kis Highness for the grant ot a concession in G-wadur? and said that here too His Majesty’s Government considered that the concession would require their approval. They had so informed the Companies. It was explained to the Sultan that a particular reason for this stipulation in the case of Gwadur was the absence of a definite boundary between Gwadur and Kalat. It would be essential to demarcate the 11 ontier if an oil concession were to be operated. The Sultan agreed, and was willing that when a concession was granted the matter should be discussed and arranged between him and the Government of India (not between him and the Ivhan of Kalat). But there was no immediate need for it. Because of this obstacle of the necessity for the approval of Government he had decided not to proceed with the negotiations with the Burmah Oil Company and Indian Oil Concessions Ltd. He professed not to be disappointed if there were no oil Concession in GY/adur (or in Muscat) and if no payments were made to him. He added however that of course he was entirely free to give any concessions he liked in respect of minerals (not oil), since Government could not point to any undertaking in that respect. (Intld.)

Dear Hay, For your information Streatfeild saw the Sultan of Muscat in Bombay on 16.6.38 and showed him a copy of the letter dated 28.4.38 which he (the sultan) had previously received from our London office. The Sultan's only ccmments were (in Streatfeild»s words) as follows He noted the increased offer made at his request* He drew attention to the fact ttet royalty on gas was not mentioned. I said that we would be prepared to pay this at usual rates on gas spldU K but pointed out that there was practically no proppect of a market for gas. He appreciated this. ^ only c yv • &lt;1) (ii) 2 . (iii) He did not agree to the clause that the con ce sslpn could be transferred to any Company. He said he might definitely object to certain Companies entering his territory. I advised that we were quite prepared to make it any British Company. This appeared to satisfy him. (iv) He was not quite clear as to the procedure to be adopted when obtaining H.M.G's sanction to the agreement. I said that we should be quite prepared to arrange this as soon as a mutually acceptable agreement had been reached. I seemed to sense some slight feeling of irritation at this clause, which I understand is quite probably the case. (v) in response to a query from him I advised that the payment of -/4/- per ton (clause 14) covered only stores imported by the company for its own use and for the use of its employees for their own use. I agreed that neither the Company nor its employees could sell to outsiders anything duty free under this clause. This appeared to be accept able to him. • Streatfeild goes on to say * I tentatively suggested that he might desire a more detailed discussion in Karachi and that a draft of the agreement proposed by us might then be submitted to him. To this he did not indicate any definite agreement or disagreement, but he did definitely say (a) that he would not be prepared to make any final decision before his return to Muscat and (b) that he would like to see our representative at Muscat in October or November to discuss and agree the final terms of the concession.

A point vhich we omitted to mention in our tel jgrazn J:oi6ll dated the 14th Hay 1938 is that we consider it undesirable that dif erent Companies should be operating in the small Gwadur enclave and the adjoining portions of Kalat territory. The position with regard to halat is that both the Burtm. Oil Company and Indian Oil concessions Limited wish to obtain concessions. It is necessary or the latter Company to obtain a certificate of approval and it has not yet been decided whether this should bs e^iven to th^am or not* In any case it may oe a long time before a concession is granted by the idian of Kalat to either Company! It mig^it perhaps be suggested to the dultan that he should wait and see to which Company a concession is granted in Kalat before coming to a decision himself.

May I please request here that when Your Highness is ready to #?ant the concession, we should be informed so that we may send a representative to Muscat to conclude the final negotiations ? 3, I informed your Highness that our Directors had agreed that if and when Your Highness is ready finally to grant us the concession, the offer made in our London Office 1 s letter of 28th April 1938 should be increased in two respects. First on the signing of the Agreement the Company will pay to Your Highness the sum of Rs75,000/- (seventy five thousandc. ltd. COPY. 2 . P. O. Box 272, KARACHI.

Secondly the Company trill pay to Your Highness during the Option Period Rs£,500/- (two thousand five hundred rupees) per month instead of Rs£,000/- (two thousand rupees), making Ral,50,000/- (one hundred and lifty thousand rupees) in all instead of K«l,20,000/- (one hundred and twenty thousand rupees). Should the Company ter minate the Agreement or declare its intention to take up the con cession before the expiry of five years from the signing of the Agreement, the balance of Rsl,50,000/- outstanding at the date of such termination or declaration will be payable to Your Highness. 4. Certain points in regard to the form of contract, whidi had been raised in a previous conversation by Your Hi^iness* Revenue Minister, we re next discussed and the Clauses which I suggested might, subject to the approval of our Directors, be incorporated in the contract appeared to satisfy Your Highness. In regard to your request that provision should be made for the payment of compensation in the event of accident to any of the Company’s employees I stated that I felt sure that my Company would agree to the payment of such compensation. I asked whether the rates and conditions of compensation as laid down in the Indian Workmen’s Compensation Act would be suitaole and I understood Your Highness to assent to this. I informed Your Highness that we would draw up and submit to Your Highness a draft form of Agreement for Your Highness* ap proval; and you confirmed that there would be no inconvenience to.■tfSL.: J .0 c. ltd.

My dear Oibson nth reference to your letter of 19 th May No. a. z.3424/38 xetter or the same date, it is rather difficult to comment sauisfactorily on the merits of the respective proposals at this stage, as the Burmah Oil Company on the one hand give only a brief outline of the heads of an agreement together with the financial terms which they are prepared to agree to, while Indian Oil concessions Limited have produced practically a complete form of Concession Agreement (which follows fairly closely the other Commercial agreements in the Persian Gulf) but without the figures, so that it is not at present possible to compare the financial terms. )n the whole the offer made by the Burmah Oil Company is a reasonable one and compares satisfactorily with the financial terms ofother agreements in the Persian Gulf area. Considered in relation to the area to be covered by the Concession however, the financial payments will be on the high side, as I understand that the available area in Gwadur is likely to be only a small one when the boundary is finally demarcated. A , - I notice that under article 7 of Ballantyne's Draft the Company may ♦’deGlare M when it has found crude oil in ’’commercial quantities*’.

Dear Gibson, n.8 Jarrett is away, I am writing in reply to your letter of the 19 th May (P.z. 3424/38) about the Gwadur Oil Gwadur Oil Concession should go to the Burraah Oil Company rather than to the half-.jnerican (and presumably American controlled) Indian Oil Concessions. We have, however, no special comments to make on the terms of the two Companies* offers, except that article 17 of the Burmah Company's offer in their letter of the 28th April enables the Company to transfer their concession to M any other company” and Indian Oil Concessions appear to ask for similar powers in the preamble to their draft, in which the term M company” is stated to include their ’’heirs and assigns’*. r e think that at least some definite provision should be made in the Political Agreement to the effect that transfer would be conditional on the assent of H.M. Government, and would prefer that similar provision should be made, if possible, in the concession ibseli. as regards the Burmah Company, it would presumably be stated in the Political .agreement that consent would be given to transfer only to a British company, and should to stipulate that British interests shall be maintained at at least the strength (50%) which they apparently have to maintain to satisfy Indian law, and that transfer will not be permitted to any company with less British interest. of Political Agreements between H.M.

Dear Mr.Gibson, I refer to letter P.Z.3034/38 of the 4th May. I Mr.J.P.McCulloch, the representative of Indian Oil Concessions Limited, is at present at Karachi where he is in touch with Lt.Col.Sir T.C.W.Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and with the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. Mr.McCulloch has been given permission by the Political Resident to continue with the negotiations between Indian Oil Concessions Limited and the Sultan and, as I understand it, to conclude them upon a provisional basis before the Sultan leaves Karachi, which I am told he intends to do on the 10th July. Mr.McCulloch has received from his Company all necessary instructions to proceed, including the following instructions, namely:- (l; Po use the form of Agreement, copies of which you have and which, for identification, are endorsed with the date 28.4.38. (2) To avoid altering such draft excepting to fill in the monetary terms agreed upon in the blank spaces provided for the purpose and, if necessary, to fill in the blank spaces in Article 25 with 'the President of the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague.' (3) To make the Agreement conditional for its effectiveness, on the consents thereto being obtained from the Government of India and the British Government, the Clause to be added at the/^ ip 2 . the foot of tne draft for this purpose, reading as follows :: The foregoing provisions of this Agreement are conditional upon and shall become effective only as from the date upon whicn the Sultan obtains approval tnereto as provided for by the Agreement between the parties referred to in the letter dated 21st Jamadi I, 1341 (10th January, 1923) from Taimur bin Faisal to Major Rae, H.B.M.Consul, Muscat, it being understood that the Sultan will obtain such approval with all reasonable despatch.' / The Political Resident has asked Mr.McCulloch whether the foregoing Clause emanates exclusively from the Company or whether it has received the sanction of the India Office. The Clause has not, of course, received the sanction of the India Office, a,nd with a view to enabling negotiations to proceed to a conclusion, I should be glad if you would tell me that you have no objection to such a conditional Agreement being concluded on the basis of the Clause I have quoted above.
