The letter also informs Pelly that Ameer Fysul had instructed his deputy at Brynee [al-Buraimi] to send his brother Abdul-Aziz al Saud to Jaalan as Amir and that they were now awaiting the arrival of a third brother, Majid from Lahsah [Al-Hasa] before departing.The letter also reports on the general opinion along the Oman coast that recent disturbances have been owing to the extending Wahabee influence and that although the English destruction of Rasal Khyma [Ra's al Khaimah] in 1820 had kept affairs quiet for a time in recent years the Wahabees had been increasing their influence unchecked.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023479696.0x000007#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
