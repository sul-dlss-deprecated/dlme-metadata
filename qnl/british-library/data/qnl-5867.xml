It speaks of the approaching great war, of « movements of British officials in this connection i.e. Colonel Dickson to Riyadh, the Advisor to the Shaikh of Bahrain paying a rapid visit to Bushire (Captain Hickinbotham) the flying of Captain Morgan,R.N., to Bagdad, etc., and ends by advising the establishment of Commercial and Consular representation of Iraq in the Persian Gulf States.

'Jedda' he said, 'is now nearer than ever'- 'why not repeat your trip that way'. *1 can say now on behalf of the King that you would be welcome'. I promised to let him ki.ow if I could come. He suggested that the Bpring, after the Pilgrimage, would be a good time as the King would then be in Riyadh. 2.

Here a strong wind was blowing clouds of large grass hoppers into tho oar, much to ^ady Carlisle’s distress, as everywhere thqy left brown oily marks on clothing. There was little life in the desert, we saw one bustard, and a warar scuttling along with its tail in the air.

At 4-15 p,m. we bade farewell to the ^mir and made for El H&amp;maer where the king had arrived to camp for the night, leaving in the early morning for JaRYA, and so South to visit his Oil ''ells# After an hour and a half motoring over a very bad sandy road between strange table top formations, sandstone hills, we suddenly saw a large camp below us. Accompanied by Ibrahim we were met by YUSSIR YaSSIN the, king 1 s Private Secretary, and sat and talked for half an hour on very uncomfortable chairs, with -the word 'Welcome' burnt on the becks# Shortly prayers took place, and it was strange sight to see hundreds of men in a long line genuflecting, giving the impression of waves in Hie distance . Meanwhile, we had time to wash for dinner which was served at a table in another tent. Again six courses and more were served, the party constLstiigg of Yus si f - as a in, the king’s Syrian doctor, khalid the Interpreter, Ibrahim, Ifidy Carlisle and myself. -ne conversation chiefly turned on -alestine troubles, which Yassif assin said ran like a poison throt^h the whole Arab world, which wished to be friendly with the English, a problem he said 'that was easy to deal with frcm their point of view, but he understood the difficulties of the English'. He employed silly arguments, such as 'how would we like Jews to be planted on us in England to govern us' and so forth. I said 'that between foreign propaganda and self-seeking politicians it was very difficult to settle, but that was ccnv*nced that ifin - 3 - if only the people were left to themselves it would solve itself'. He said ’'they were perfectly aware of inflamatory propaganda from abroad', but I said 'nonetheless, young people would always be influenced by it'. ifter dinner we sat outside and had coffee and more gossip, I mistrust wholeheartedly Yussif Yassin, whose profile looks like an ancient ^Syrian sculpture, with his pointed ^ beard, eyes and nose, all at different angles. He left me shortly to see the Mng, and then returned to say that we would be received after 8-15 p.m. He asked me 'what particular question had I to ask ills Majesty.' I replied guardedly 'none in particularand we than drove to tiie King’s tent. I was particularly struck by his magnetic personality, charming manner and smile also his way of putting one at his ease. J»fter the usual compliments I asked him his opinion of the European situation. He replied 'that all countries were eqaaliy, in their different ways, working towards a war but that he hoped that the c.emocracies would succeed in keeping the peace, and teat it was nooessaiy with proper understanding that England and Arabia should progress side by side for they both needed eaon other, hut that other Nations should not be allowed to interefere' , cr come between them', I had been told by Ibrahim to avoid the lalostine question as it made him sad; he also told me that he had sent Hoosvelt a letter on the subject a copy of which he said he would give me but which unfortunately I forgot to ask for. lady Carlisle asked questions about Nuri Pasha and *Iraq, all of which were turned off in a religious discourse by the King. I praised the democratic spirit of Arabia, His Majesty replied 'that in Government, power must be us&lt; d in the right way and that only religion could teach it and that outfit not to be fanatical, but moderate, tempered with understanding'. 1. The Moslem owed every thing to Allah, 2. the Koran gave the Lawfcs of Hfe to be followed, thirdly there was the obligation to treat your neighbour justly. 1 theB, * ht lllce eT ® r y° n « that it is simple for one who has attained power, but he was very right in saying that few having attained it know how to use it. ^t a sign from Yussif Yassin who for some time was already anxious for us to go, we took our leave. £hen we visited/- 4 - 1 visited the ^mir Saud. Conversation consisted of banalities about his visit to Englfnd for the Coronation, Gleneagles, etc. Before dinner the Finance Minister B £S hid el foubashi car® to see us,also we noticed the son of Ibn Bashid of Hail. His Majesty received every night all the wireless reports from iondcn, Paris, and Berlin, as well as Arabic broadcasts from all quarters, and nightly reads about fifty pages of them. I had the impression tha t any real or political question was taboo, and found as usual that not being able to speak or understand the language a great disadvantage. midnight or after when we returned to our sleeping tent which Yassin had mnde comfortable with mattresses and pillows a slight reviving drink vras necessa: y after the long drive and emotions of the evening, fho result was that we sat and takked until 3 a.m. with the prospect of a start at dawn. Mth /ipril. 1939 , At 4~30 a.m. I woke up and the camp was still there and the beginning for the departure was being made. At 5-15 a.m. I looked out already dressed to find that L a dy Carlisle aid myself were practically the only people sitting there, surrounded only by the desert strewn with the debris peculiar to an Arab in camp. Luckily in the hot dry air it was not noticeable to the nostril*. breakfasted with Khalid, noticed that the servant was a Soudanese whom I recognised was one who was in the employment of 3ir Andrew Ryan our Minister in Jedda whom I was staying with him 0 three years before. H e asked after de Oaury. Yussif Yassin arrived with presents from the King of clothes and money for our servants, an -^rub dress of purple and orarge silk heavily embroidered in gold for Lady Carlisle, and an K r ab costume for myself and a gold dagger. Vie were shortly Joined by Ibrahim who had come to say good-bye to .^ady Carlisle who unfortunately was still dressing. YtTboxl YASSIM told me the King would receive us again at Jarya and say good-bye if we would leave shortly after him. »e eventually eft, ai Haaaar at 7 a.m. and reached Jarya at about 8-30. On tbe w*y I changed into the Kafi.h cloak that the King had givengiven me, and also wore the dagger. Hie cloak was big and heavy, big enou^i to have been made for His Majesty, which made it awkward to wear. The drive to Jarya was even worse than on our arrival, for the road across the s^nds had been well cut up by the Ford lorries and cars moving camp, which I believe consisted of some seven hundred men and two hundred and sixty or more oars. The sight on arrival at the Fort of Jarya gave one the impression of a large market place enfete, everywhere groups of people looking hapry and proud, masses of various oars driving all over the place. 0 u r oe r was immed lately surrounded on all sides by many Arabs, handsome Bedouin with fleshing teeth and long curls, enormous niggers with bandoliers and rifles, and young boys laughing with gay open smile, all wishing to have their photo graphs taken. Yussif Yassin sent a message that the King was ready to receive us, and we drove under the gateway into 13ie courtyard of the Fort. His Majesty was holding his diwan on the roof - Lady Carlisle «id myself had great difficulty in walking up the stairs in our unaccustomed clothes chiefly because the stairs no longer existed, being built merely of mud they had disintegrated. I very nearly tripped up over my cloak, put ny foot through the skirt, and nearly lost my sandlts. I saluted HJs Majesty and squatted down on ^his right with Khalid the Interpreter. As usual Yussif Yassin had placed himself so that £one had to look at him when talking through -3ialid, and always had the feeling of his baneful aye upon me, waiting to signal the moment that I should withdraw, A clerk was reading the wireless news from Various capitals - it was interesting to hear that compulsory service for boys from 18 to 21 had been decided upon in England, in these sunrounding, and the more extraordinary as that on my return to Kuwait that evening, they did not yet know there, and only heard it on the Hadio at that evening as being in Chamberlain’s speech that afternoon. One would think that a vast desert country practically closed to all Burppeans would be away behind other -*rab countries that have touched Western civilization and ideas, ±k like Iraq. On thethe contrary, His Majesty has so organized his people that without loosing their individuality as Arabs, keeping a pure -^rab civili zation, he yet manages to have the best information which, coupled v/ ith his om Judgemait, to him a natural instinct, and rare gift, he is able to sum up the situation all over the world. In every way it struck me how excellent his organization must be. The feet that he took the trouble to send a young Syrian clerk who sppke l^ench to meet us hours away, with a tent to resrt in, and tl e compliment of a European meal to eat, shows what meticulous c.;re to detail is to be found in this desert Kingdom. The King agreed with “che idea of conscription, and seemed extremely pleased, and again reiterated how necessary was for us both the friendship between his country and Great Britain. I thanked him for his present and said the gold dagger would always remain a treasur in my house, the^n said good-bye as he was obviously busy. Outside the diwan was a flat open roof with warriens groupec about on it - lady Carlisle asked Yussif Yassin if she could photograph them. He rather demurred and said that His Majesty was in a hurry, and would shortly be coming out. Nothing daunted she took the camera from Khalid and started to focus the group through her veil, not noticing that at that moment the King appeared in the doorway, and stood looking on with a smile 01 his face. 1 could but admire the courage of women in such circumstances where even without the presence of King I should have hesitated to photograph. W© left Jarya about 9-30 a.m. reaching Kuwait just before 4 p.m. In spite of lack of sleep and motoring for hours through great heat one did not feel any special fatigue - the air of the desert must be so invigorating. How right the ^rabs are to know the King as EL SHEIKH 3S SHOUKH the Sheikh of Sheikhs. The people seem happy and admire and look up to the King as their leader and he has the monopoly 5n his Kingdom of all wireless and motor oars, which gives him both a full warning of any revolt there might be and a means ipt and a monopoly of swift counter action, which is not posressed by anyone else. There seems to be no reteon that on his death the Kingdom ofT * &lt;^l of Saudi Arabia should not continue- The King and Nejdi in general seems to me to be a person who could be relied upon in war, if his word were once given, he is not like seme other Eastern nations who 1 believe would always be treacherous, if events went against us, whatever their professions* I was very greatly impressed, not only by the radiating personality of the King, which I had been led to expect, but the sense of great control from the centre, and reliability, which even the short glimpse of his Court gave one. A good friend for England to have and one worth taking trouble with I felt.Confidential. Political Agency, Kuwait, 9th June, 1939. in D.O.

Alington*s remarks on Ihn Gaud are, in my opinion, much more illuminating. He seems to draw a picture of an able bodied man in the full possession of his vigour and personal magnetism, succeeding in making both felt from a well controlled centre of administration to the frontiers of the country. One gathers a picture of a fine and charming man daily working on the affairs of his country, and spending his evening studying the complicated affairs of Europe.

Vcamp, occupied with the affairs of his country, his neighbours and the world generally, who realizes the advantage of the control of swift transport and radio receiving sets, and who yet had time to arrange for the comfort of his guests, I cannot help thinking contrasts favourably with the gloomy picture drawn by Dame of £ v ^1, man approaching senility - vide Weightman’s letter No.722 of the 27th November, 1938. .ftiich of the two pictures is correct, I, of course, do not know, but one thing stai^Ls out clearly, and that is that the affairs of the country are being pursued with vigour, and in tha absence of anyone else to push matters it seems reasonable to presume that Alington's sketch of Tbn 3 au&amp; is accurate.

I rather expect that the real truth is somewhere between Alington f 8 picture on one side, supported by Weightman's account of ibn Sand's recent visit to Bahrain, and that of Dame. A man’s doctor normally knows more about his health than his friends do, and I daresay that when there is some special effort to be made, such as the reception of a distinguished guest upon whom he wishes to make a favourable impression, or a visit to a neighbouring Ruler when he is much in the public eye, Ibn Saud can rise to the occasion, un the other hand, when it is a case of his daily work, which after all counts most for him as a Ruler, it is quite possible that he has begun to flag. « 3. However, he may go on 'flagging*, and still retain ing sufficient control of affairs, for quite a long time. The present Ruler of this country has been, according to some reports, 'dying* for the last 5 years or so, and iu seems to agree with him. ^ £2 Major A.C.Galloway, IA«, Political Agent, Kuwait•» - * * * I — .V .Telegram ?rom - Political \gpnt, Kuwait.

The Honorable, The Political Agent, Kuwait, Persian Gulf My dear M?jjor Hickingbotham: Receipt is hereby acknowledged of your letter of Dec, 20, 1942 requesting that the American personnel at Shuweikh be warned that they must not enter Saudi Arabia on hunting expeditions. All the men have been so instructed, * So far as is known the trips to date have not necessitated the crossing of the Kuwait-Saudi Arabia border. All trips have been under the guidance of Ades bin Saleh, the head guard furnished by His Highness Shaikh Achmad. Your letter was obviouly occas- sioned by the misunderstanding that our trip of Dec. 19th took us to G-esumah where the Shaikhs of Bahrain are evidently camping. Although I am not certain as to the exact location of the hunting area we visited, as far as I could determine from Ades we were still a considerable distance from the border. I shall request Ades to be care ful and prevent the hunting parties from entering Saudi Arabia, so as not to cause any difficulties between His Highness Shaikh Achmed and the Saudi Arabian Government.

Wakefield, l.C.S Political Agent, Bahrain. Subject. Conditions in Saudi Arabia.(Received under Bahrain D.O.Letter Uo.C/477 dated 7«4e43) Conditions in Saudi Arabia• (^t ' Dr. Storm and Mr.Van Peureem of the American Mission at Bahrain have recently returned from a medical tour in Saudi Arabia in the course of which they spent six weeks in Riyadh. Mr. Van Peursem reports that, so far ae he could see, food, including rice, was plentiful. He said that prices were high but that, as the labouring and servant classes received their pay in food, the high prices did not greatly affect them. He saw no signs of starvation and heard no complaints about lack of food. 2. Dr. Storm confirmed what Mr. Van Peursem had told me independ* ently. He thought that the general condition of the people was good. The only persons who appeared to be suffering were the Bedouin whose flocks and camels were in poor condition owing to lack of grazing during past seasons. He said that there were very few beggars in Riyadh and that the •su^* there had many things not available in Bahrain e.g. soap, toilet requisities and similar articles of every day use. 3. Dr. Storm said that everybody in Riyadh appeared to be in good spirits as a result of the excellent war news. He said that general feeling was in favour of the Allies. Hatred and contempt of Italy were universal. There appeared, however, to be apprehension about Russia’s future policy and power. Ibn Saud mentioned to Dr. Storm during each of five or six interviews his expectation that Russia would demand a commercial outlet on the Gulf after the war. According to Dr. storm views in Riyadh about Russia had been greatly influenced by the fate which had befallen a Russian diplomatic or consular representative at Jedda and a Russian lady doctor there, it is believed in Riyadh that these tv/o Russians were *put out of the way* on their return to their country because they did not hold advanced v communist viev;s. 4. Dr. Storm said that Bashir Syed Alawi is the closest to the King of his counsellors and has most influence v/ith him. Syed Alawi has strong feelings about the intervention of foreigners in Saudi Arabian affairs. Though he considers all foreign influence evil he thinks the British are less to be distrusted than other foreigners. 5. Dr. Storm was amazed at the way in which the King, in spite of his advanced age, still retains all power exclusively in hie own hands and delegatee no authority to any one- not even to the Crown Prince. Not onlv does he listen avidly to nev/s collected from the radio broadcasts of foreign stations but he takes a personal interest in the smallest item of news from any part of his own extensive territories. 6. Dr. Storm told me that Ibn Saud gave him 1500 as a fee for the medical services he had rendered. Dr. Storm received also Es 500 from the Amir Saud and about Es 1000 from private patients. Sd. E.B.

His report would later be sho^n to His Fa esuy’s Government. 3. He confirmed that Amir Faisal would shortly pay official visit to U.S.A. probably immediately after Ramadhan. Invitation was I understand extended to Ibn Saud but he deputed Faisal to act for him and not Saud because latter is said to have eye trouble.. Saud is in charge of tribal affairs and could ill be spared. 4. Hoskins talked to me of Zionist movement in the U.S.A. and indecretions in the American press. I received the impression that his visit was to reassume Ibn Saud and counteract Jewish oropaganda. = POLITICAL =Telegram - 'S'.
