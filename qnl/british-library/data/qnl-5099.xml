BO AND OP TRADE, Mercantile Marine Departmcn-t, © INSTRUCTIONS TO CONSULS •April, 1936 :erce'J\ t t shippinc and seahm The following Instructions relate to paragraphs in the Instructions to Consuls (Merchant Shipping and Seamen), 1930:- Masters, Officers and v/ireless Operators. The Board of Trade have been advised that the obligation to carry cerbiicated officers which Section 92, Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, imposes on a foreign-going ship applies only when a ship goes to sea from any place in the United Kingdom; the obligation does not continue throughout the voyage. Paragraph 97 should be amended accordingly. The following should be noted in connection with Chapter X, Paragraph 200, and Chapter XI, Paragraph 212, Distressed Seamen Regulations II (persons who may be relieved). The question whether seamen are in distress or not is one to be decided by the Consul on the merits of each case. The fact that seamen who have been discharged on the ground of injury in the service of the ship or sickness not due to their own fault come within the provisions of Section 34 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1906, as regards medical treatment, maintenance, and conveyance to a proper return port does not necessarily make them distressed in a legal sense and Consuls have no authority under Section 48 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1906, to compel a master uf a British ship to accept such seamen for repatriation as distressed British seamen unless in fact they are actually in distress apart from being sick. The Beard of Trade have, however, agreed with representatives of the shipping industry that the Conveyance Order provides a convenient method for the repatriation of sick seamen. Masters who, without good cause, refuse tc accept Conveyance Orders in such circumstances, will not be facilitating the working of this arrangement, and the Board will be prepared to take up with the master or owners cases in which the Order is refused without reasonable' cause. Distressed Seamen.Deserters Relief and repatriation cannot be refused to distressed British seamen but in the case of deserters and those whose distress is regarded as having resulted from their own misconduct, the Consul should be especially careful to secure that they do not receive relief il they refuse to accept reasonable employment (see Distressed Seamen Regulations, No»V). in certain cases.the deportation of su^^ seamen may be required by local Immigration Laws, and, though the' ' existence of such Laws is in itself irrelevant to the question whether a seamen is or is not in distress, if he is, in fact, detained by the Ajocal Authorities (probabuy at the Owner* s charge) or arrangements are being made for his deportation independently of the Merchant Shipping Acts, he should not be treated as a distressed British seaman, dhere, however, in the last mentioned case the owners, through their agents or otherwise, zuraish a written undertaking to bear the charges of the seamen’s maintenance and/or repatriation, the Consul may make prevision for such seamen in accordance with, the Distressed Seamen Regulations. In such a case, however, it should be clearly understood that the Consul will have no power under Section 4-6&gt; Merchant Shipping Act, 1906 to corn-pel a shipmaster to carry the man as a distressed seaman. In the event of a shipmaster refusing to take such a man under a Conveyance Order the man should be referred back to the ship’s agents unless within a reasonable time the Consul is able to find a master willing to take him. Paragraph 220 should be amended accordingly. Account Forms 1 he use ox i?orm C.42 has been discontinued and the reference to the form should be deleted from Appendix ”0'’. M. 14387/35. E.J. FOLEY’, Under Secretary.Circular 1691. Board of Trade, Mercantile Marine Department. December, 1932. Consul 4. INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE USE OF CONSULS. LOAD LINE AND LOADING. (1) The attention of Consuls is called to the fact that Part II of the Merchant Shipping (Safety and Load Line Conventions) Act, 1932, and the Rules and Regulations made thereunder relating to the marking of load lines, the recording of particulars of depth of loading, the carriage of timber deck cargoes, etc., will come into full operation on the 1st January, 1933, and that the load line provisions of the Acts of 1894 and 1906 will cease to have effect on that date. (2) The general effect of the new Act and Regulations is : (а) to require to be marked with load lines the same ships as were required to be marked under the Acts of 1894 and 1906 but to extend the requirements to British ships registered in the United Kingdom sailing from ports outside the United Kingdom ; (б) to permit the carriage of deck cargoes of heavy timber in winter ; and (c) to regulate the depth to which a ship may be loaded at different seasons in the different parts of the world. (3) A number of amendments to the Volume of Instructions to Consuls which was circulated in 1930 are necessary in consequence of the coming into operation of the new Act, and Chapter IV (Load Lines of Ships and Overloading) has therefore been rewritten. The revised Chapter which is attached hereto should be inserted in place of the existing Chapter IV in the Instructions to Consuls, 1930. (4) The following Amendments should be made in Chapter I of the Volume of Instructions :— (a) Paragraph 24—Safety. The load line provisions of the earlier Merchant Shipping Acts have been repealed by the 1932 Act, and at the end of the first clause in this paragraph the following words should be inserted “ and also in Part II of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1932, which repeals the load line provisions of the earlier Acts” . (b) Paragraph 26—Loading of timber—Should be deleted as it has now been transferred to Chapter IV (see paragraph (74 b)).(5) Revised Official Log Books and forms of Agreement are being printed and will shortly be available. These will contain full information as to the particulars of the deck line and load lines which are required to be entered, and the log books will also contain information as to the particulars in regard to depth of loading, etc., which must be entered therein. It is desired, however, that existing stocks of official log books and agreements should be amended by means of the gummed slips which have been furnished to Consuls for use until these stocks have been exhausted and Consuls will in this matter be guided by the Instructions contained in paragraphs 4 and 5 of Circular 1685 (Consuls 2) of May, 1932. (6) Consuls should note that after the 1st January, 1933, the amended official log book and agreement should be used by all load line ships registered in the United Kingdom including any which may for some special reason have failed to have been surveyed and marked under the 1932 Rules and which have not, therefore, been furnished with the new forms of certificates (see paragraph 1 of Circular 1685 (Consuls 2) of May, 1932). Paragraphs 2, 3 and 6 to 10 of Circular 1685 (Consuls 2) of May, 1932, are hereby cancelled. December, 1932. E. J. FOLEY, Under Secretary. (19293(1)—15) Wt. 10508-6802 375 5/33 P. St. (i. 3 (T.S.8276)CHAPTER IV. LOAD LINES OF SHIPS AND OVERLOADING. 67. General.—One of the most important factors in securing the safety of cargo ships is the enforcement of the laws and regulations relating to load lines and overloading. Questions on this subject are most likely to come before a Consular Officer by way of complaint by a crew who consider that their ship is overloaded and are unwilling to sail in consequence. In such a case, if the complaint appears to have any material foundation, the Consul should endeavour to get the Master to have a survey made by an independent Surveyor, and his further action would be determined by the result of this Survey. If, on survey, the ship is found to be overloaded, she must be lightened by the discharge of cargo or otherwise, until the appropriate load line is no longer submerged. Should, how ever, the Master be unwilling to agree to a survey and should the Consul nevertheless be satisfied that the complaint is a serious one he should bear in mind the possibility of summoning a Naval Court. In this connection reference should be made to section 463—1894, and to the Instructions relating to Naval Courts. Should it come to the Consul’s notice otherwise that a ship is loaded more deeply than allowed by the appropriate load line marks he should call the attention of the Master to the matter, pointing out to him that by so doing he is not only breaking the law, but is unjustifiably endangering the ship and the lives of all on board. The main facts and considerations to be borne in mind in dealing with this very important matter are set out below. Should the Consul require any further instructions in dealing with a serious case he should telegraph as full particulars as possible to the Board. 68. Application of Load Line Marks.—The extent of the loading which is permitted to a British ship by law is defined by certain lines marked on the ship’s side called the Load Line Marks ; these marks consist of the well-known circular disc, having an horizontal line through its centre and forward of it a vertical line with certain horizontal lines to indicate the various seasonal load lines and also the fresh water allowance. All these lines are set off from a statutory deck line and the distances between the deck line and the load lines are shown in the load line certificate, the ship’s agreement and the official log book. The position of the disc and the lines on any ship is determined by careful calculation on the basis of tablesapproved by the Board of Trade which are designed to give the maximum safe loading for a sea voyage in the various parts of the world at the different seasons of the year. 69. Meaning of load line marks.—The load lines marked on the side of a ship indicate the maximum depth to which the ship is entitled to load, having regard to the season oi the year and to the zone or area in which the ship is loaded and through which she intends to carry her cargo. Section 44— 1932, provides that a British load line ship registered in the United Kingdom shall not be so loaded as to submerge in salt water, when the ship has no list, the appropriate load line Where the ship has a list it is necessary to take the mean oi the two positions ; for example, if the line is submerged two inches on the one side and is two inches clear on the other the ship is not too deeply loaded. Section 44 also provides that it the owner or master of a ship allows the ship to be so loaded as to submerge the appropriate load line in salt water, he is liable to a fine and the ship may be detained until she ceases to be overloaded. The maximum depth to which a ship is entitled to be loaded at different seasons of the year in various parts of the world is now definitely laid down in the Load Line Rules, 1932. The various zones and the winter, summer and tropical seasons are given on the chart which is scheduled to the Rules. Copies of this chart have already been supplied to Consuls. In the summer and tropical zones ships may load to their summer and tropical lines respectively throughout the year, but in the other (seasonal) zones and areas ships may only load to the line appropriate to the zone or area, and the season of the year, as defined on the chart. Where a ship has to pass in the course of her voyage from one zone or area into another in which less deep loading is allowed, the loading of the ship must be so arranged that when she arrives in the second zone or area, the load line appropriate thereto shall not be sub merged. Similarly the loading towards the end of the summer season should be such as will ensure that the winter load line (or the winter North Atlantic load line) will not be submerged at the beginning of the winter season. Where a passenger ship has been marked with sub-division load lines and the appropriate sub-division load line (i.e., the sub-division load line appropriate to the space for the time being allotted to passengers) is lower than the load line indi cating the maximum depth to which the ship may for the time being be loaded under the Rules, the ship must not, when more than twelve passengers are carried, be so loaded as to submerge the appropriate sub-division load line.30 70. Allowances for Fresh Water, etc.—The only other points in connection with the load line marks which need be borne in mind are the questions of loading in fresh water and loading some distance up a river. There is marked on the ship a line distinguished by the letter F, the distance between which and the summer line indicates the increased depth to which the ship may be loaded in fully fresh water, as compared with the loading in salt water. The amount of this allowance is shown on the Load Line Certificate and entered in the Agreement with the Crew. If the water in which the ship is loading is only partly fresh then a proportion only of this allowance may be taken in determining the loading of the ship, the amount being determined by the extent of the departure of the water from the fully salt condition. The density of salt water being taken as 1.025, if the density of the partly salt water is 1.017, then the water would be considered to be 8/25ths fresh and about l/3rd of the full fresh water allowance could be taken and the appropriate load line submerged to that extent without a contravention of the law. If the ship is loading a long way up a river, then in addition to the fresh water allowance there would be an allowance for the amount of fuel consumed before the ship reaches salt \\ ater, and this would be determined by the rate of fuel consumption of the ship and by what is called the “ tons per inch immersion of the ship. This latter figure is shown on the Certificate of Registry and gives the weight required to sink (or lighten) the ship by one inch at about her sea going draught. 71. Water Ballast.—A claim may also be made that a ship is not too deeply loaded because there is a large amount of water ballast which will be got rid of before the ship gets to sea. A claim of this kind should be carefully scrutinised and unless it is clear that the water ballast will really be pumped out before the ship effectively sails the claim should not be allowed. Water ballast is often necessary, for example, in the case of a ship with a large deck load, to secure the stability of the ship and in this case it forms part of the loading of the ship. It cannot, therefore, be assumed that this water will be pumped out at any stage of the voyage, and indeed in many cases it cannot be pumped out without danger to the ship. 72. Particulars of depth of loading, etc.—Under the Load Line (Particulars'of Depth of Loading, etc.) Regulations, 1932, made under Section 50—1932, the master of every load line ship registered in the United Kingdom is required to enter in the Official Log Book, before the ship leaves any dock, wharf, harbour or other place for the purpose of proceeding to sea, the following particulars :—Foreign-goinq Ships. (1) The positions of the deck line and the load lines (if not previously entered), together with the draught of water which would be shown on the scale of feet on the stem and stern post of the ship if she were so loaded that the upper edge of the summer load line were on the surface of the water and the ship were upright on an even keel (i.e., the mean draught to the centre of the disc). (2) The actual draught of water of the ship as shown on the scale of feet on her stem and stern post when the ship is loaded and ready to leave, together with the actual freeboard amid ships on each side of the ship and the mean freeboard. (3) The density of the water. (4) The allowances, if any, for fresh water, ashes and rubbish to be thrown overboard, and estimated weight of fuel, water and stores likely to be consumed before the ship reaches salt water. (5) The mean draught of water and the mean freeboard which the ship will have in salt water, as calculated after making the above allowances, if any. (6) The date and time of posting the Notice containing certain of these particulars which is required by Section 50 (2) (6) —1932 to be posted in some conspicuous place on board the ship. (See paragraph 73). Home Trade Ships. The masters of these ships are required to record in the Official Log Book the particulars stated in (1), (2) and (3) above. All Ships. The entries referred to at (3), (4) and (5) above need not be made if the load line indicating the maximum depth to which the ship is entitled to load is not submerged when particulars are taken of the actual freeboard under (2) above. 73. Posting of Notice.—The Master of a foreign-going ship is also required to put up, in a conspicuous place on board the ship, a Notice (Form L.L. 14A, or L.L. 14 B for timber ships) giving particulars of the draught and freeboard of the vessel on leaving any dock, wharf, harbour or other place for the purpose of proceeding to sea. The Master and First Mate are required to sign the entry of these particulars. 74. Reports.—Any cases in which complaint is made to the Consul that a ship is overloaded should be reported to the Board with a statement of the action taken. Where it comes to his notice that a ship bound to the United Kingdom is alleged31A to be overloaded, the Consul should send a report to the Board, d necessary by telegraph, so that the ship may be visited on arrival and the case investigated. 74a. Entries in Official Log Books and Agreements.—Section 50—1932, requires the master of a load line ship registered in the United Kingdom to enter in the Official Log Book before making any other entry, the particulars as to the position of the deck line and load lines specified m the certificate. Th^se particulars are also required by Section 51-1932 to be entercu in the Agreements. . , It in any case a Consul should observe that these entries have not been made in the Official Log Book or Agreement or that particulars of the depth of loading have not been entered in the Official Log Book, he should call the attention of the master to his failure to comply with the provisions of the Act and Kegula- Additional freeboard sheets, for use by ships which, during the currency of an Official Log Book, make ent ™“ ces and clearances, can be obtained on application to the Super intendent of Stores. 74b. Loading of Timber.—Section 61—1932, and the Timber Cargo Regulations, 1932, made under that Section regulate the carriage of a cargo of timber on any uncovered part of a free board' or superstructure deck. These Regulations app v throughout the year and apply to ships registered in the Umted Kingdom whether or not bound to ports in the Umted Kingdo . The amount of deck cargo is not limited in the san J e “ all ^ r as was done in Section 10-1906 (now repealed), and the pro hibition of the carriage of deck cargoes of heavy wood goods m winter has been removed, but in winter the height of a timber deck cargo above the freeboard deck must not exceed third of the extreme breadth of the ship. The Regulations, which contain special provisions apP 11 ^ 1 ® to ships marked with and using the special timber !oad lines are printed in the revised form Surveys 109, copies can be obtained from the Superintendent of Stores.

(Merchant Shipping and Seamen.) WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY. 1. Consuls are informed that Part I of the Merchant Shipping (Safety and Load Line Conventions) Act, 1932, which gives effect to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1929, will come into operation on the 1st January, 1933. 2. Copies of the new Statutory Wireless Rules which embody the wireless requirements of the Convention are attached for the information of Consuls. These Rules take the place of the Merchant Shipping (Wireless Telegraphy) Rules, 1927 (S.R. and 0. 1927, No. 529), the Merchant Shipping (Wireless Telegraphy) Rules Amendment Rules, 1928 (S.R. and 0. 1928, No. 499) and the Merchant Shipping (Wireless Telegraphy) Rules Amendment Rules (No. 2), 1928 (S.R. and 0. 1928, No. 899). The issue of these Rules involves a revision of Chapter V, relating to wireless telegraphy, of the Instructions for the use of Consuls (Merchant Shipping and Seamen) 1930. The revised chapter is attached hereto and should be regarded as replacing the existing chapter as from the 1st January, 1933. 3. Under the new Rules the ships which must be equipped with wireless telegraphy are the same as under the previous Rules, that is, all sea-going passenger ships irrespective of the tonnage, and all sea-going cargo ships of 1,600 tons gross tonnage and upwards. 4. In other matters the new Rules embody some changes and special attention is drawn to the points explained in the following paragraphs 5 to 8. 5. The classification of ships for the purpose of the Statutory Wireless Rules has been revised and is now based on the gross tonnage of the ship instead of the number of persons on board. The classification of ships is shown in Rule 2. 6. One qualified wireless operator must be carried in all ships to which the Rules apply ; and in the case of ships of Class I, which under the Rules are required to keep continuous watch, additional operators (or watchers) must be carried unless the ship is fitted with an approved auto-alarm.2 7. The employment of watchers is permitted under the new Rules provided they hold certificates showing that th&lt;3y possess the new standard of qualifications laid down by the Safety Convention. 8. The present system of grading wireless operators according^^ to their length of service will no longer be operative, but thd^B chief or sole operator on all ships in Classes I and II (i.e. all^^ passenger ships, and all cargo ships of 3,000 tons gross or over) must have had at least three months’ service at sea as an operator (see Rule 9 (4)). 9. In the case of ships registered in the United Kingdom which are required by the new Rules to carry a greater number of operators than under the previous Rules, but which experi ence difficulty in securing the services of the necessary additional British operators whilst trading away from the United Kingdom, the Consul need take no action at present beyond calling the attention of the Master to the requirements of the new Rules, provided he is satisfied that the ship complies with the existing Rules. If the ship is due to return at a later date to the United Kingdom, the Master should understand that he will be required to comply with the rules as to operators on again putting to sea from the United Kingdom, if he has not already complied. If the ship is not likely to visit the United Kingdom within a reasonable period, the case should be reported to the Board of Trade. 10. Arrangements are being made for the issue of radiotele graphy certificates on and after 1st January, 1933, to cargo ships of 1,600 tons gross and upwards registered in the United King dom. So far as is possible the surveys necessary for such certificates will be carried out by the Surveyors of the Board of Trade in the United Kingdom, but should a ship registered in the United Kingdom which is trading abroad require a certifi cate for production in the ports of any of the Safety Convention countries, the Consul should report particulars of the case to the Board of Trade for instructions. So far as the United Kingdom is concerned, the production of Safety Convention certificates on clearance will not become obligatory until 1st January, 1934, and it is anticipated that a similar period of grace will be allowed in the other Convention countries which are bringing the Convention into operation on 1st January, 1933. The following is a list of those countries:— Canada. Denmark. Finland. France. Germany. Italy. The Netherlands. Norway. Spain. Sweden. M,15234/32. E. J. FOLEY, Under Secretary.mmmm mm 3 INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE USE OF CONSULS. 1 The following paragraphs numbered 75 to 82 are to be substituted for paragraphs numbered 75 to 84 in the instructions. CHAPTER V. WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY. 75. —Authority for, and scope of, requirements.—The require ments as to wireless telegraphy are contained in the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1904, the Wireless Telegraphy Order, 1908, the Merchant Shipping (Wireless Telegraphy) Act, 1919, the Merchant Shipping (Safety and Load Line Conventions) Act, 1932, and the Rules made under the two last mentioned Acts. The first-named Act deals with wireless telegraphy generally, and among other things makes it compulsory to obtain a licence from the General Post Office in regard to every wireless telegraphy installation, whether commercial or experi mental. The Wireless Telegraphy Order, 1908, extends the provisions of this Act to British ships, whilst on the high seas ; the 1919 and 1932 Acts are confined to merchant shipping. Under the 1919 Act the fitting of a wireless telegraphy installa tion is compulsory on all sea-going passenger ships registered in the United Kingdom, irrespective of their size, and on all sea-going cargo ships registered in the United Kingdom of 1,600 tons gross, and upwards. Part I of the 1932 Act makes the necessary amendments to, and extensions of, the Merchant Shipping Acts to give effect to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1929, and includes a provision for the issue of International Safety Certificates and Radio telegraphy Certificates. In pursuance of their powers under the 1919 and 1932 Acts, the Board of Trade, in consultation with the Postmaster General, have made statutory rules prescribing the nature of the wireless telegraph installation to be provided on ships required to be fitted,^the watches to be kept, and the number and qualifications of the wireless personnel to be carried. The current rules are the Merchant Shipping (Wireless Telegraphy) Rules, 1932, S.R. and O., 1932, No. 897. 76 . —Classification of Ships.—Under the statutory Wireless Rules ships are classified according to their character and gross tonnage, there being three classes, as follows :— Class I.—Passenger ships of 3,000 tons gross or upwards, and cargo ships of over 5,500 tons gross tonnage ;Class II.—Passenger ships of under 3,000 tons gross tonnage and cargo ships of 3,000 tons gross tonnage or upwards, but of not more than 5,500 tons gross tonnage ; Class III—Cargo ships of 1,600 tons gross tonnage ° i i , i? i o non O! 77 . Exemptions.—The Board have exempted, under the powers given them in the Merchant Shipping Acts, all sailing ships in existence on the 1st September, 1920. In addition individual ships are occasionally exempted from the necessity to carry wireless for single voyages undertaken in specia. circumstances. In the case of ships on international 'vovages, an Exemption Certificate indicating the nature of the exemption will be issued to the ship. (See paragraph 81). 7 g—Apparatus.—If it should come to the notice of a Consul that a vessel falling within the scope of the statutory require ments is not fitted with a wireless telegraphy installation and an exemption has not been granted, a report should be made to the Board of Trade. 79 . Requirements as to Wireless Personnel.—As indicated in paragraph 76, the classification of the ship depends on its character and size. Rule 9 of the Statutory W ireless Rules requires that every ship to which the Rules apply must carry at least one qualified wdreless operator. The same rule also requires that ships of Class I, whose hours at sea exceed eight, must carry either one or two additional qualified wireless operators (or certified wireless w r atchers) according to the length of voyage to be made by the ship concerned ; or alternatively, such ships must be fitted with an approved apparatus which automatically receives and registers the alarm signal. This apparatus is generally known as an “ auto-alarm.” On ships fitted with an auto-alarm only one operator is required under the Statutory Rules in any circumstances. The additional operators or watchers referred to in the first sub-paragraph are required in Class I ships not fitted with an auto-alarm as follows :— One additional operator or If the hours at sea exceed 8 , watcher. but do not exceed 48. Two additional operators If the hours at sea exceed 48. or two watchers, or one additional operator and a watcher.The definition of “ hours at sea ” is the “ normal number of hours occupied in a voyage between one port of call and the next.” The duration of a voyage should be reckoned from dock to dock. In the case of passenger ships holding International Safety Certificates and cargo ships holding Safety Radio-telegraphy Certificates, the certificate will show the number of operators or watchers required and whether the ship is fitted with an auto-alarm. 80.—Qualifications of Operators and Watchers.—Every person operating a Wireless Station on board a ship registered in the United Kingdom, including the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, must hold a Certificate of Proficiency conferred by the Postmaster General indicating that the holder has reached the standard of proficiency required under the International Radio-telegraphy Regulations. The certificates issued to operators in ships required by the Merchant Shipping Acts to be fitted with Wireless telegraphy are of two kinds (a) First Class ; (b) Second Class. Wireless watchers, to be eligible for employment in pursuance M the Statutory Rules, must hold \V atchers’ Certificates issued by the Postmaster General in accordance with the requirements of Article 30 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. Under Rule 9 of the Statutory Rules an operator possessing either the First or Second Class Certificate of proficiency may be employed as an operator on any British ship, with the proviso that before being qualified to act as the chief or sole operator on board a ship of Class I or C lass II he must have been actually employed at sea as an operator for a period of at least three months. The Consul should require production of a wireless operator’s or watcher’s certificate of proficiency before signing him on, and if the operator is to act as the chief or sole operator on board a ship of Class I or Class 11 he should be required to produce evidence of the three months sea service mentioned above, unless this qualification is attested by an endorsement on the operator’s certificate or discharge book. For this purpose evidence that an operator is already qualified to serve in Grade I or Grade II under previous Wireless Telegraphy Rules, will be sufficient. 81 —Exemption Certificates.—In the event of exemption from any of the wireless telegraphy requirements being granted to a ship registered in the United Kingdom which is engaged » LtUSonal voyage, the Board of Trade will ..ueW the owners, or their representatives, an Exemption Certificat(5 showing the nature of the exemption, the voyages to which it applies, and the conditions, if any, on which it is granted. 82.—Failure to Comply with the Rules.—In the event of a ship not being provided with operators and watchers in accord ance with the Rules, the Consul should report to the Board of Trade if, on warning the Master of the requirements of the Acts and Rules, he cannot secure compliance. In cases where it comes to the notice of a Consul at the termination of a voyage or during a voyage that there has been failure to comply with any of the statutory requirements, he should, without delay, obtain statements from the witnesses in the usual way and should report the case to the Board of Trade.

Copies have already been circulated to Consuls, through Superintending Consular Officers, of a new edition of the Volume of Instructions to Consuls on the subject of mer chant shipping and seamen. These Instructions will super sede all general instructions on this subject that were issued to Consular Officers before the 1st July, 1930. A certain number of amendments to the new volume are necessary in consequence of decisions taken since the book was passed for Press. A neostyled list of such amend ments was circulated with the new volume, together with a list showing the principal points in which the new In structions differ from the previous edition, which was issued in 1914. Copies of the 1914 edition may now be destroyed. In order to facilitate the notation of the amendments to the new edition and the preservation of the details of omissions and new features, the two lists mentioned in the preceding paragraph have been printed and copies are attached. The print includes several instructions which have been settled since the neostyled circular was issued. These are distinguished by a *. Consuls are requested to take careful note of the amend ments. The Home Office have recently drawn attention to serious difficulties which have arisen in cases where coloured sea men who have no proof of British nationality have been sent to this country as distressed seamen; in order to prevent these difficulties arising in future the instructions in Para graphs 224, 225 and 227 of the new volume should be care-T 2 fully observed. In this connection, Consuls are reminded that the immigration restrictions in force in this country apply to British protected persons as they apply to aliens. E. J.

Corrections and Modifications Resulting Mainly from Decisions made since the Book was Passed for Press. ^ Paragraph 53.—National Colours: line 2, after the words Red Ensign ” delete the asterisk and footnote and insert the following “ or in the case of ships registered in certain Dominions, Colonies, and Protectorates, the Red Ensign with a modification authorised by Admiralty Warrant under Section 73 (1)—1894.” ^Paragraph 131.—Add at the end: — Article 13 of the International Labour Convention 1926 concerning Seamen’s Articles of Agreement pro vides that: If a seaman shows to the satisfaction of the ship owner or his agent that he can obtain command of a vessel or an appointment as mate or engineer or to any other post of a higher grade than he actually holds, or that any other circumstance has arisen since his engagement which renders it essential to his interests that he should be permitted to take his discharge, he may claim his discharge, provided that without increased expense to the shipowner and to the satisfaction of the shipowner or his agent he furnishes a competent and reliable man in his place. In such case, the seaman shall be entitled to his wages up to the time of his leaving his employ ment.’ ff It will be observed that discharge under this Article can be claimed only if the shipowner or his agent is satisfied. For this purpose the master may be regarded as the agent of the shipowner. “ Where the conditions of this Article are fulfilled, the case should be regarded as one of discharge by mutual consent and the consul should not withhold the sanction required by Section 30—1906.”Paragraph 168, line 9.—After “ charge 2s. 6d.,” delete the rest of the sentence. Paragraph 169.—For the last sentence substitute the following, “ No charge is to be made for a Continuation Dis A. when the previous book has been filled and has not ^-Jbeen mutilated; otherwise a charge of 2s. 6d. should be aade.” Paragraph 170.—Insert at end:—“A similar procedure should be followed where a seaman has lost his book by fire at sea.” *Paragraph 196. Wages chargeable with expenses. —The Board desire to remind Consuls that in cases of injury the incidence of liability for expenses depends solely on the question whether the injury was sustained in the service of a ship and not, as in the case of illness, on the question whether it was due to the seaman’s own wilful act or fault or his own misbehaviour. It is, therefore, essential that in every case of injury all the relevant documents, and in particular the form C.16 or C.16a. should include, in addition to a statement of the nature of the injury, either the words “ sustained in the service of the ship ” or the words “ not sustained in the service of the ship ”, as the case may be. Paragraph 202.—Second sub-paragraph, penultimate sen tence. Add the following . . . “ in a sealed envelope addressed to the officer at the port to which he is travelling, with the caution that, if the letter is tampered with in any way, payment will be refused.” Paragraph 222.—Add at the end “ It is considered un desirable to claim for British protected persons the privi leges accorded under these international agreements to sea men who are British subjects. British protected persons who are in distress by reason of having been shipwrecked, discharged, or left behind from a foreign ship may, how ever, be afforded relief under the Distressed Seamen Regu lations on the same conditions as British subjects.” Paragraph 232.—Repatriation under local Immigration Law. Since this paragraph was written the Board of Trade have been advised that the obligation to relieve and re patriate distressed seamen, under Section 41 of the Mer chant Shipping Act, 1906, and the Distressed Seamen Regu lations, is not affected by the existence of any local law placing an obligation to repatriate the men on the owners of the ship from which the men were left behind. 10867Paragraph 232 of the new Instructions should, therefore, he cancelled. The Instruction that relief should be afforded to deserters only when absolutely necessary, however, still stands (see paragraph 220 of the new Instructions). Paragraph 292 and Appendix L. —Effects of foreign sea-^,^ men dying on British vessels and of British seamen dying on foreign vessels. The agreement between the British and Latvian Governments is similar to that with Finland, see page 203, except that there is no Article dealing with the payment of assets by the British Admiralty where the de ceased Latvian seaman has served in the British Navy. Paragraph 294.—After the fifth sub-paragraph, insert the following: — (For Consuls at ports within Home Trade limits only.) Foreign-going vessels using Home Trade Agreements for the period of the “ home turn-round.” —The Ministry of Health have decided to accept the view that for the purpose of the National Health Insurance Act, 1924, vessels do not cease to be “ foreign-going ships ” where Home Trade agreements (Eng. 6) are opened for the purpose of distributing and/or collecting foreign cargo, provided that the vessels do not become engaged in trade between ports within the Home Trade limits. In all cases where Home Trade agreements under these con ditions are closed before a Consul, the schedule system for the collection of National Insurance contributions should accordingly be applied—see paragraphs 300-304 and 306-311 of the Instructions. In such cases the In surance Schedule with voyage cards to be delivered to the Consul should cover contributions for the crew who are on the Home Trade agreement (whether foreign domiciled or not—parts AI to AVI of the schedule), and also, for the period since the closing of the pre ceding foreign going agreement, the crew who are on Asiatic agreement (part B of the schedule, see the new paragraph 305 below). The documents and the moneys should be disposed of in the usual mannei see para graph 303 of the Instructions. Paragraph 305.—Delete this paragraph down to “ ... European agreement is opened,” and substitute the follow ing :— (For all Consuls.) Seamen on Asiatic Agreements. —It has been decided that in all cases where foreign-going European agree ments (Eng. 1) are opened on or after 1st May, 1931,5 © owners shall pay National Insurance contributions for seamen engaged on Asiatic agreements strictly in accord ance with statutory provisions, i.e. by reference to the actual weeks of each seaman’s employment, and not in accordance with the special arrangements set out in paragraph 305 of the Instructions, which is hereby can celled. No schedule is required to be furnished on the termination of the Asiatic agreement if the vessel’s European agreement is still in force. The Employers’ contributions payable in respect of seamen on Asiatic agreements, and all other foreign domiciled seamen, are to be included in the schedule rendered on the termina tion of the European agreement, and should be paid for the whole period covered by the European agree ment, notwithstanding the fact that this will normally overlap parts of the periods covered by two successive Asiatic ^agreements. The same schedule should also in clude Employers’ contributions for seamen on Asiatic agieement in respect of the vessel’s home turn-round preceding the foreign-going voyage, except where a Home Trade agreement was used for the period of the home turn-round (see the above addition to paragraph 294). With this exception, therefore that schedule will normally include in part B two series of contributions in respect of seamen on the Asiatic agreement, namely (1) those for the home turn-round and the outward voyage, and (2) those for the homeward voyage. *Paragraph 325. ihe list of denominations of Unemployment Insurance Stamps supplied to Consuls should be altered to read as follows : — To be used only in the case of boys (aged 16 but under 18 years); 8d.—To be used in the case of men (aged 21 but under 65 years) holding Exempt Person’s Unemployment Books, Hd- To be used only in the case of young women (aged 18 but under 21 years); 1/ld.—To be used in the case of women (aged 21 but under 65 years) or for young men (aged 18 but under 21 years); l/3d.—To be used only in the case of men (aged 21 but under 65 years); 5/0d.—To be used as an eight weeks’ contribution for boys (aged 16 but under 18 years), or for four weeks’ contribution for men (aged 21 but under 65 years);&amp; ' 8/8d.—To be used as an eight weeks’ contribution for women (aged 21 but under 65 years), or for young men (aged 18 but under 21 years); 10/0d.—To be used only as an eight weeks’ contribu tion for men (aged 21 but under 65 years). * Paragraph 326.—The paragraph heading and the firs^-^- sentence should be altered to read as follows : — “ Surplus and obsolete stamps : — “ The Ministry of Labour have requested that masters or pursers of British ships holding any surplus or obso lete unemployment insurance stamps which have not been affixed to any material should be advised to return them to the Insurance Department, Ministry of Health, London, S.W.l, with a claim for the refund of their value.” Paragraph 403.—Seamen’s Money Orders—Procedure. After line 10 insert the following:—“Advices should con tain the fullest possible information concerning the remitter and the relationship between the remitter and payee. The amount of the Order both in figures and words should be clearly shown on the advice.” Paragraph 407.—Remittances to Seamen’s Savings Banks. Line 7. After the first sentence insert the following:—“ It is essential that both the Money Order and the advice should be forwarded to the Board of Trade.” Appendix “ D.”—After “ Application for renewed certi ficate ” insert “ (Officers).” On next line.—Insert “ Application for renewed certi ficate (Cooks) . . .

Consuls and Officers are therefore requested to ensure sufficient stocks to meet the needs of United Kingdom ships calling at their ports. The second and third paragraphs of the Instructions dated 24th June, 1948* should not be taken to mean that not more than one continuation book should ever be issued. Sufficient copies should be issued at least to enable the radio officer to keep the statutory record until he reaches a port at which further supplies should be available.

INSTRUCTIONS TO CONSULS SHAMLN'S WELFARE 1 # As you have been informed, the Ministry of Transport on 1st April, 1948, transferred detailed responsibility for the co-ordination of seamen’s welfare in home and overseas ports to the Merchant Navy Welfare Board, 2, The Board now propose to undertake a coup rehens ive review of present day welfare facilities in all the main ports of the world. They Iiave therefore sought the assistance of various bodies, (including the Ministry of Transport) in collecting the necessary information. The Board feel that until this information is complete, they will find it difficult to discharge their functions in the overseas field. The Board will not wish to intervene in any area where welfare arrangements are satisfactory but it has a responsibility. (1) to co-ordinate overseas work (2) to give advice and guidance where necessary and, subject to the demands on its resources, it hopes to be able to make grants where it is necessary to supplement local resources. 3, The Board are seeking their information through the following channels (1) By direct reports from the Voluntary Societies, such as the Missions to Seamen, British Sailors’ Society, etc. who already have extensive overseas interests; (2) by encouraging reports from individual seamen and their Trade Unions; (3) through the Colonial Office, who are collecting information about ports in British Colonies and Protectorates; ( 4 ) through the Ministry of Transport, who are asked to collect information in respect of foreign and Dominion ports. 1 4 . The Ministry feel that they can best meet the Board’s needs by arranging for the submission of periodical reports from Consular and other overseas Officers. Consular Officers are therefore asked to assist by forwarding in duplicate a report on the welfare amenities in their ports. This report should i give as much information as is available on the following points (a) Name of Port. (b) Number of vessels (l) British, and ( 2 ) foreign, using the port each month, and average length of stay. (c) Number of seamen (l)*British and ( 2 ) foreign, going ashore each month. (d) Whether welfare facilities are provided, and if so, by whom. A brief description of the premises, stating vrtiether residential or non- residential. (e) Whether additional welfare facilities are needed. (f) Detailed composition of the Port Welfare Committee, if any. (g) Name and address of the Secretary of the Port Welfare Committee, if any.

A number of cases has occurred recently where, in the absence of Owners representatives, proper authorities have paid for laundry, hair- cutting, toilet articles, tobacco, etc», on behalf of sick and injured seamen* Shipowners are in some cases refusing to reimburse these expenses on the ground that such items should normally bo met by the men from their wages, particularly as, for the first twelve weeks of sickness, they are receiving special payment equivalent to full pay* As, in many cases the balance of special payment has been settled before the accounts are received from abroad, recovery cannot be effected, and these expenses become ultimately a charge on public funds* 2, The attention of proper authorities is drawn to paragraph 199 o*^ Instructions to Consuls, and paragraph 109 of Instructions to Officers in British Dominions, etc. These paragraphs refer specifically to charges which are not the statutory liability of the Owners, although in certain circumstances the Owners may be willing to accept liability as an act of grace. If, however, the Owners are not prepared to do so, the proper authority may at his discretion regard the instruction to make small advances to cover the cost of tobacco as equally applicable to the items listed in paragraph 1 of this Notice. 3* Where a seaman has been taken in charge under the Distressed Seamen Regulations ; expenditure in respect of such items may be made and charged in the accounts with this Ministry* Caro should be taken, however, that such charges are kept within reasonable limits.

Memorandum for Sh ipowners and Masters of Ships. INTRODUCTION. 1. Two new schemes of national insurance come into full operation on 5th Julj, 1948. The general scheme supersedes the existing schemes of unemployment insurance, health insurance and contributory pensions. The industrial injuries ■scheme supersedes the existing scheme of workmen s compensation. These two schemes cover all seafarers in British ships who belong to the United Kingdom or the Isle of Man. There is no salary limit. The two schemes generally apply also to Eire seafarers in British ships. The industrial injuries scheme covers certain foreign seafarers. 2. Generally, the arrangements for the payment of contributions follow the pattern of the former national insurance schemes, but there are some important changes. THE GENERAL SCHEME. BRITISH SHIPS. 8 . The masters and members of the crews (a) of all ships registered in Great Britain, Northern Ireland, or the Isle of Man (other than those which are owned in Eire), and (b) of all other British ships or vessels, of which the owner (or managing owner if there is more than one owner) or the manager resides or has his principal place of business in Great Britain, Northern Ireland or the Isle of Man, are insured as employed persons under the general scheme of national insurance. 4. Ships which are registered in Northern Ireland (other than those which are owned in Eire) come within the scope of the Northern Ireland scheme. Ships which are owned or managed in the Isle of Man come within the scope of the Manx scheme. The schemes in Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man are similar to the scheme in Great Britain, and are linked with the scheme in Great Britain by arrangements which establish complete reciprocity. 5. Ships which are registered in the United Kingdom but owned in Eire, come within the scope of the Eire schemes of unemployment insurance, health insurance and contributory pensions Ships which are registered in Eire, but owned in the United Kingdom, come within the scope of the British scheme. But in all British and Eire ships which are on regular trade between the two countries, those of the seafarers who are resident in Eire are covered ('subject to exclusion for salaries over £500 a year) by the Eire schemes, and those ot the seafarers who are resident in the United Kingdom are insured under the British scheme.14. Home-trade ships are: ships and vessels sailing between ports in the United Kingdom, Eire the Isle Man, the Channel, Islands, and the continent of Europe between the River Elbe and Brest inclusive. 15. Foreign-going ships are: (a) ships and vessels sailing between the United Kingdom and places beyond the limits described above; and (b) ships engaged in regular trade on foreign stations. RATES OF CONTRIBUTIONS. HOME-TRADE SHIPS. 16. The normal weekly rates of contribution, which cover both National Insurance and Industrial Injuries Insurance, are as follows: Contributions payable Employer s. d. Seafarer s. d. Total s. d. Man aged 18 and over 4 2 4 11 9 1 Boy under 18 2 5£ 2 10i 5 4 Woman aged 18 and over ... 8 8 3 10 7 1 Girl under 18 1 11 2 4 4 3 17. Where the seafarer is by the industrial injuries scheme domiciled seafarer who is resident excepted from (e.g., a man 1 in one of the the national insurance scheme but covered who is 65 before 5th July, 1948, or a non- countries mentioned in paragraph 12 above) the contributions are: — Contributions payable Employer s. d.

Where a non-domiciled seafarer is excepted, both from the national insurance scheme and from the industrial injuries scheme (i.e. he is not resident in any of the coun nes mentioned in paragraph 12 above) the rates of contributions are as follows: — Contributions piyable Man aged 18 and over Boy under 18 Woman aged 18 and over Girl under 18 Employer s. d. 1 9 Seafarer s. d.

PAYMENT OF CONTRIBUTIONS. 20. A contribution is paid for every week in which a seafarer is employed. A contribution is required for part of a week. The contribution week begins at midnight Sunday and ends at midnight on the following Sunday. full on 21 The employer, in the first instance, pays the lull contribution _ covering the sea farers share as well as his own. He is entitled to recover the seafarer s share from the seafarer’s wages for the period covered by the contributions. 22 The duty of ensuring that contributions are properly paid rests primarily on the shipowner ^ the employer, or on the manager on his behalf But it is the master who is ordinarily responsible for seeing to the payment of contributions. Oh There are two quite separate methods of paying contributions, one for home-trade ships and o™ for foreign-gdng ships. The following paragraphs describe these methods.6 METHOD OF PAYING CONTRIBUTIONS FOR SEAFARERS IN HOME-TRADE SHIPS. CONTRIBUTION CARDS. 24. Contributions for home-trade ships are paid in the ordinary way, that is, by means of stamps on insurance cards. A single stamp each week covers National Insurance and Industrial Injuries Insurance. 25. It is the duty of a seafarer to obtain an insurance card and hand it to the master of his ship on signing articles. If he has no insurance card, he should apply for one to an Employment Exchange or a local National Insurance Office. If he has left his card at an Employment Exchange or Mercantile Marine Office where he has been claiming unemployment benefit, he should obtain it before joining his ship. If there is no time to do this, he should hand the receipt card (U.I.40) to the master of the ship, who should note his engagement on this card and send it to the Employment Exchange named on the card so that the Exchange can send the seafarer s insurance card to the ship at the address given by the master. 26. National insurance stamps for contributions under the general scheme and the industrial injuries scheme, can be bought at any Post Office in Great Britain, Northern Ireland, or the Isle of Man, or from British consular officers at the principal foreign ports within the limits described in paragraph 14 above for home-trade ships. 2i. The person who puts a stamp on a card should immediately cancel the stamp by writing the date on it in ink, or by stamping the date on it with a metallic dye and black indelible ink or composition. The date should be the actual date on which the stamp is put on the card. Metallic dyes should be used where practicable. Rubber stamps are not allowed. In no circumstances should the stamp be cancelled before it is put on the card. 28. Under the new schemes there are four different contribution years, namely, A — beginning on the first Monday in March. B — ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, June C — ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, September. D — &gt;&gt; •&gt; » ,, ,, December. Once the insured person has been allocated one of these contribution symbols he keeps that symbol throughout his insurance life. At the beginning of the new schemes, all contribution cards will start from 5th July, 1948, but they will cover different periods: A cards will cover 85 weeks, i.e., till 6th March, 1949. B ,, ,, ,, 48 ,, ,, 5th June, 1949. C &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *&gt; 61 ,&gt; ,, ,, 4th September, 1949. D &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ,, 74 ,, ,, ,, 4th December, 1949. After the expiry of these initial periods, all cards will cover periods of 52 or 53 weeks. 29. The symbol A, B, C or D is printed boldly on the front of every card. All cards with the same symbol! are due for exchange at the same time. 30. There are four different kinds of cards, namely, those for Men aged 18 and over, Women aged 18 and over, Boys under 18, Girls under 18. \Cards for men and boys are printed in black. Those for women and girls in red. Cards for boys and girls have broad vertical bands on them. 31. When a seafarer is discharged on account of unfitness or inability to proceed (a) in the U.K. or Isle of Man, the Master should give him his card fully stamped for the period of his employment. (b) in Eire or the Channel Islands the Master should forward the card to a local office of the Ministry of National Insurance on return to the U.K. (c) in any other country, the Master should hand the card to the Consular Officer. 32. When a seafaner dies or is left behind on account of desertion or missing his ship, his fully stamped card should be handed to the appropriate Superintendent by the Master when the ship first returns to the United Kingdom. 33. In all other cases of discharge the stamped card should be handed to the seafarer. 34. If the Master of the ship is holding an insurance card at the time when its currency expires, he should send it to the nearest local office of the Ministry and obtain a new card. If the ship is outside the United Kingdom, the Master may hold the card until the ship returns to. a port in the United Kingdom. EMERGENCY CARDS. 35. Every Master of a ship should obtain a small supply of emergency cards from the Superintendent of the Mercantile Marine Office. He should use one of these cards where, for any reason, a seafarer has been unable to obtain an ordinary contribution card before joining the ship, or where the currency of a card runs out during the course of a voyage and further contributions are due to be paid. 36. Before putting any stamps on an emergency card, the Master of the ship should fill in all the identity particutejrs at the head of the card. When the ship returns to the United Kingdom, the Master should give the ordinary contribution card (if the currency has expired) and the emergency card to the seafarer, telling him to take them to the nearest local office of the Ministry. NON-DOMICILED SEAFARERS. 37. Contributions for non-domiciled seafarers serving in home-trade ships are not paid by stamps on contribution cards, but by remittances which shipowners should send, accompanied by Form C.F.54, to Contributions Branch, Section 4 (a), Ministry of National Insurance, Newcastle-on-Tyne. Full directions about the method of payment will be found on this form. 38. The Form C.F.54 is a quarterly return, covering one or other of the four quarters of the year, beginning 1st January, 1st April, 1st July and 1st October. Shipowners should send in their returns within 21 days of the end of the quarter. 39 . No return need be made at the end of a quarter if a voyage of the vessel is still in progress, but the particulars for the whole of that voyage should be included in the return for the next quairter. 40. When no non-domiciled seafarers have been empbyed during a quarter, the form should be endorsed “ None ” and signed and sent in within 21 days. In other cases the Ship owner should enter the names of all vessels which he owns or manages; and, if a particular vessel has not finished a voyage, or if no non-domiciled seafarers have been employed on the vessel during the quarter, a note should be made to that effect againrt the name of the vessel.41. Where a ship is employed solely in harbours, or on short excursions or pleasure trips, or where the ship is a tug boat, hulk, dredger or steam hopper, no return is needed except for quarters in which non-domiciled seafarers are actually employed. METHOD OF PAYING CONTRIBUTIONS FOR SEAFARERS IN FOREIGN-GOING SHIPS. * SCHEDULES AND VOYAGE CARDS. 42. Contributions for seafarers in all foreign-going ships are paid by means of schedules and voyage cards. When a seafarer signs foreign-going articles, the Master of the ship should obtain hfs contribution card and keep it until the seafarer is discharged. 43. When the crew of a foreign-going ship is paid off at the end of a voyage, a cash payment is made of the total amount of the contributions due for the voyage of all the sea farers in the ship. At a United Kingdom port, this payment is made to the Mercantile Marine Office Superintendent. At a port outside the United Kingdom it is made to the Consul or Shipping Master before whom the crew are paid off. The payment should be supported by schedule (Form C.F.34) summarising particulars of the various contributions payable, and by voyage cards (Form C.F.15) for each member of the crew, including those who have left the ship or died during the voyage. Voyage cards should not be used for non-domiciled seafarers. 44. The Master of a ship should carry a stock of schedules (Form C.F.34), continuation sheets (Form C.F.34A), and voyage cards (Form C.F.15). He can obtain these from the Superintendents of Mercantile Marine Offices in the United Kingdom, from Shipping Masters at the principal British overseas ports, and from British Consular Officers at the principal foreign ports, as well as from Contributions Branch, Section 4 (a), Ministry of National Insurance, Newcastle, and the Ministry of Labour and National Insurance, Stormont, Belfast. 45. The revised forms are C.F.15 (Voyage Card) and C.F.34 (Foreign-going Ship’s Schedule). ^Where these forms are not available the old card X.702 and the old forms of schedule X.701 should be used, the entries on X.701 being m,ade in the spaces indicated in the last column of paragraph 19 above. 46. The voyage card should show the name and official number of the ship, the dates when the voyage began and ended and the dates of the seafarer’s service. These particulars may be inserted by means of a rubber stamp. The Master of the ship should take particular care to see that each seafarer's insurance number and Dis. A. number are correctly copied on the voyage card. 47. For convenience in preparing the schedule, the Master should first sort the voyage cards into groups according to the rate of contribution, and should then sub-divide each group according to the number of weeks to be covered. After summarising the voyage cards on the schedule, the Master should have them sorted back into the order in which the names appear in the agreement before they are handed to the Superintendent or Consul. 48. The schedule should be prepared in duplicate, but the Superintendent or Consul will return one copy to the Master or to the shipowner’s agent.INTERIM SCHEDULES. 49. W henever the Master of a foreign-going ship discharges one or more seafarers before a Superintendent, after he has engaged the crew but before the ship finally leaves the United Kingdom to proceed on her voyage, he should render a schedule a*nd voyage cards and should pay contributions for the seafarers then being discharged and for all other seafarers who have ceased to be members of the crew. The Superintendent will endorse the agreement with the letters I.S.R. against the names of the seafarers covered by the schedule. 50. When the agreement with the crew is a running agreement, the Master of the ship should, on every return to a port in the United Kingdom, render an interim schedule and voyage cards within seven days of his return covering those seafarers who are then being discharged a^nd all who have been left behind abroad or have died since the previous schedule was rendered, and should pay contributions for these seafarers. If any other seafarers cease to be members of the crew before the ship leaves the United Kingdom, the Master should render a further interim schedule and voyage cards and pay contributions. The Superintendent will endorse the agreement with the letters I.S.R. against the names of the seafarers concerned. PAID LEAVE. 51. Both the shipowner and the seafarer must pay contributions for periods of paid leave. 52. In the case of the Home Trade, cards should be stamped in advance at the Home Trade rate for the period of paid leave. 53. When the seafarer is on paid leave during the currency of his articles on a foreign- going ship, or where he receives payment for leave together with his balance of wages on discharge from such articles, the contributions should be at foreign-going rates. When the seafarer does not receive payment for leave at the termination of articles, but later when the leave is actually taken, contributions must be paid at the Home Trade nates by means of stamps on the contribution card. When the seafarer receives payment for leave on the termin ation of articles on a foreign-going ship, the period of leave must be regarded as running from the day after the day on which his engagement on articles terminated, even if the leave is not actually taken then. No contribution should be paid for days of leave falling in the same week as the last day on articles. The number of contributions payable for w'eeks of leave should be entered separately at the foot of the voyage card, and either included in the schedule or where that is not possible, entered in a separate schedule. 54. Where contributions have been paid, in accordance with the previous paragraph, for a period of paid leave which is treated as running from the day after the day on which the engagement is terminated and the seafarer is given harbour or shore employment bv the same shipowner, no further contributions should be paid for the weeks already covered by the entries on the schedule and voyage card, but contributions for the period “ worked by ’' should be deducted and retained by the master. When the leave is taken the seafarer s card should be stamped at the Home Trade rate for any weeks not already covered by foreign- going contributions as though the period of paid holiday ran from the day after the period of shore employment ends. 55. Thus, if the voyage engagement terminates on a Wednesday and the seafarer receives payment for two weeks of leave, contributions should be paid by schedule for the two calendar weeks following the Wednesday; and, if the seafarer is given harbour employment by the same Shipowner from the first Wednesday and remains in that employment for three weeks the Master should deduct and retain three weeks’ contributions. When the seafarer goes on leave, a stamp should be stuck on his contribution card for the third calendar weekafter the week in which he went off articles, and two further stamps should be stuck on the spaces for the two following calendar weeks. 56. The periods for which national insurance contributions are paid both for the voyage dates and for any paid leave should, in future, be shown on the seafarer’s account of wages. It will be authenticated by the addition of the office stamp at the Mercantile Marine Office when the seafarer is discharged. SUPERNUMERARIES. 57. Members of the crew of a ship who are unpaid or are paid only a nominal wage for their service ag members of the crew are not treated as members ot' the crew for the purpose of contributions. 58. 1 ersons who are not members of the crew of a ship or are not treated as members of the crew, but are employed under a contract of service on board the ship, are insured under the general scheme of national insurance and under the industrial injuries scheme if (a) their employment is for the purposes of the ship or the crew, or of the passengers or cargo or mails carried by the ship, and (b) they have entered into the contract in the United Kingdom with a view to its performance, in whole or in part, while the ship is on her voyage. This might include cattlemen, shop assistants and hairdressers. Generally, it is not the ship owner, but some other employer who pays contributions for these workers.

J h f0 ™ Se T S T an a PP lioation by ‘he seafarer for sickness or industrial injury benefit and a report by the Master. Benefit can be paid to the dependants of a seafarer or some other person in the U.K. whom he appoints to receive it on his behalf, while he is abroad after discharge owing to sickness or injury, and the form enables the information necessary for this purpose to be supplied. 62. Supplies of the form can be obtained from Mercantile Marine Offices in the United Kingdom or from Shipping Masters or Consular Officers abroad, and a supply should be carried on board. 63. When a seafarer is discharged abroad owing to sickness or injury, the appropriate portion of the form should be signed by the seafarer if he is able to do so or, if he is not by a responsible person. W11 64. ihe Proper Officer will send the completed form by air mail to the Ministry of National Insurance, Newcastle, and will send subsequent reports on form B.F.19A., and a specimen is attached. 65. this arrangement for the certification and forwarding of the form* by the Proper Officer is not intended to affect the normal procedure under which the Master is responsible for making arrangements for the care of seafarers left behind sick. Ship’s agents who act for the Master in this respect should keep in close touch with the Proper Officer advising him if the seafarer (a) dies. (b) becomes fit for work, (c) fails to maintain contact. 66 . If a seafarer has to be left behind at a place where there is no Proper Officer to act in accordance with paragraphs 63 and 64 above, the Master should ask his agents, or other responsible person in whose care the seafarer is placed, to forward the form B.F.19 to Newcastle and send monthly continuation reports, if possible on form B.F.19A. 67. Ihe local office of the Ministry of National Insurance will begin paying benefit to the person nominated by the seafarer on form B.F.19 as soon as possible after receiving the first notice of incapacity, and at the same time will inform the Shipowner of the amount being paid and the date of the first payment. This will enable the Shipowner to adjust the allotment in accordance with the National Maritime Board Special Payment arrangements. In the rare case where the seafarer exhausts his benefit, the Ministry will inform the Shipowner. 68 . Payments will usually begin not later than 10 days after the notice of sickness reaches the Mercantile Marine Clearing House at Newcastle, and it is hoped that, as far as possible, payments to the dependants at the full rate of the seafarer s allotments will continue until the payment of sickness or injury benefit is begun. 69. Where a seafarer who has been left ashore sick or injured later recovers, the days intervening between his recovery and his arrival at a home port, or his obtaining employment in another ship, as the case may be, will be treated as “ days of incapacity ” for sickness benefit purposes, provided that he returns at the earliest possible opportunitv. Payment of sickness benefit will, therefore, be made for this period. 70. When a seafarer vrho has been discharged abroad arrives in the United Kingdom as a fare paying passenger, the Shipowner responsible for paying his passage should inform the Ministry of National Insurance, Newcastle, of his arrival. When, however, the seafarer travels on a Conveyance Order, the Mercantile Marine Superintendent at the port of arrival will inform the Ministry. 71. In certain circumstances seafarers discharged outside the United Kingdom, otherwise than on account of sickness or injury, will be able to qualify for unemployment benefft for the period they are abroad, provided that they put themselves in charge of the British Consul or Shipping Master within 14 days of the time when they cease to be employed in a Brit'sh ship or, if at the time of being so left they were placed in custody, immediately after their release. This entitlement to benefit will be subject to the usual conditions and, in particular, will be subject to a disqualification for a period up to 6 weeks when it is found that the seafarer has lost his employment through misconduct or has left it without good cause. The benefit will not be paid outside the United Kingdom, but will be paid to a deputy chosen by the seafarer, or it can be kept until he returns to this country. vRATES OF BENEFIT. UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT AND SICKNESS BENEFIT. 72. The ordinary weekly rates of benefit are: — Cnemployment 8. d. Sickness s. d. Men, single women and widows, aged 18 and over 26 0 26 0 Married women aged 18 and over (see below) 20 0 16 0 Roys and girls under 18 (see below) 15 0 15 0 Increase for one dependant adult 16 0 16 0 Increase for one dependant child 7 6 7 6 These rates, except that for a dependant child, may be reduced if the contributions paid or credited fall short of the number required MARRIED WOMEN. 73. A married woman receives the same rate of benefit as a single woman of her own age if: — (a) she is entitled to an increase of benefit for her husband, or (b) she is living apart from her husband and cannot get financial help from him. Married women under 18 receive the same increase in benefits as young persons. YOUNG PERSONS. 74. Young persons under 18 who are entitled to an increase of benefit for a dependant receive the appropriate adult rate of benefit for themselves. INJURY BENEFIT. 75. Injury benefit is a temporary payment of a fixed amount paid during total incapacity for work, w r hei-e the injury is due to an accident arising out of and in the course of the seafarer’s employment. The period for which it is payable is known as the “ injury benefit period. ’ which cannot last longer than 26 weeks from the date of the accident. The rate of benefit for an adult is 45s. weekly, plus 16s. weekly for an adult dependant, if any, and 7s. 6d. weekly for a child dependant, if any. The weekly rate for a person between 17 and 18 without dependants, is 33s. 9d., and for a person over school leaving age, but under 17 without dependants, is 22s. 6d. weekly. Persons under 18 with a dependant or dependants are entitled to benefit at the adult i-ate. If incapacity still exists at the end of the 26 weeks, disablement benefit will be paid. The amount of the disablement benefit depends on the extent of disablement. 76. Daily rates of unemployment benefit, sickness benefit and injury benefit are 1 /6th of the weekly rates.-1- Circular No. 1835 Consuls No. 134 Colonial No, 132 Ministry of Transport, Berkeley Square House, London, V,1. 24th June, 1948.

With reference to Circular No. 1821 (Consuls 120, Colonial 118) of the 10th July, 1947, Consuls and Officers abroad are informed that the Inland Revenue have issued a revised Income Tax Deduction Table for Merchant Navy personnel which should be used on and after the 6th July, 1948. The Pay-As-You-Eam scheme for the deduction of income tax from the '-wages of seafarers remains unchanged and the arrangements set out in Inland Revenue Circular 5M. are .till effective. 2. The new deduction tables should be used for all engagements: (a) commencing on or after the 6 th July, 1948, 01 (b) commencing on or after the 6 th i»pril, 1948 and ending on or after the 6 th July, 1948.A X mmm \ b h T :^ P ^ nt ^ abl ® s sh « uld be used for engagements on or after the oth July, 1,47 and ending before the 6th July, 1948. 4 ^r-ager.cnt on foreisn-ijoin- articles commenced before the t ' i - “I'f 11 &gt; 1 -'^&gt; ■ arid continues until -the 6th July, 1948 or bevond that date, the tax should be calculated as follows:- according to the present table, up to the end of the last A complete month or complete six days prior to the 6th April 19A8 counting xrom the date of engagement, and ’ ’ according to the new table, from the date following that up to which^ ohe calculation has been made on the present table (and applying the six days rule where necessary).

Code indicating family circumstances. The Table contains a separate scale of deductions for each of the following 1Q types of case, each type being given a descriptive coding as shown— Type of case Coding Single man or widower without dependants ... ... S „ with one to three dependants S1 to S3 Married man with wife and no other dependant ... M &gt;t „ „ „ one other dependant ... M1 ,, ,, two to five other dependants M2toM5 If the letters “ OUK ” appear in the articles instead of one of the codings listed above, no tax is to be deducted from the wages of the seaman in question. 2. Period of deduction. The amount of tax shown in the Table under the column headed “ Month ” must be deducted in respect of each complete month on Articles, or period when in receipt of Shipwreck Unemployment Indemnity or Special Payment (when discharged sick abroad). In an uncompleted month, the amount of tax shown in the column headed “ Six days ” must be deducted for *each complete period of six days. If the payment of wages relates to a period of over 11 months on continuous Articles, only 11 months deductions should be made for each 12 months of the period of Articles. 3. How to ascertain the amount of deduction. The monthly rate of pay on Articles is shown in the table, and the tax to be deduct ed in any individual case will be the “ Month ” and “ Six day amounts shown against the rate appropriate to that case multiplied by the number of months and complete periods of six days respectively, for which wages are paid. Thus, for an A.B. coded “ S ” (i.e. a single man without dependants) on Articles for 2 months 21 days at a rate of pay of £24 per month, the deduction would be twice the amount shown against £24 in the “ S ” column headed “ Month ” (i.e. twice £2 15s.), plus three times the amount shown in the adjacent column headed “ Six days ” (i.e. three times 11s.), making a total deduction of £7 3s. No deduction would be made for the odd period of three days. If a Seaman’s Wages Calculator is in use, the tax to be deducted in this case can be ascertained by reading off 2 months 18 days at £2 15s., i.e. the tax shown in the column headed “ Month ”. No account is to be taken of overtime, leave pay whether on or off Articles, pay in lieu of leave, or sick pay in the United Kingdom. 4. Where exact rate of pay does not appear in Table. For monthly pay below £60 where the actual monthly rate is not shown, the next rate below that being paid to the seaman should be taken, e.g., if the rate of pay is £25 12s. 6d. a month, it should be treated as £25 10s. Od. for tax deduction purposes. For monthly pay exceeding £60, where the exact monthly rate and tax deduction are not given, on account of the £5 or £10 steps in the Table, the correct deduction should be obtained by apportionment, working to the next lower sum of £1 in the case of fractions of a £. Thus, to arrive at the tax appropriate to a rate of £124 15s. Od. per month, add to the tax applicable to £120 4/10ths of the difference between that tax and the tax on £130. 5. Changes in rate of pay or coding. If the seaman s rate of pay is changed on promotion or derating or there is any other change in the rate of remuneration, or if the seaman’s coding is altered during the currency of the Articles, the deduction should be made as follows — First calculate the deduction at the original rate of deduction for the whole period of the Articles. Then add or subtract the difference between the old and new rates of deduction for each month or period of six days during which any change operates. 6. Disputes concerning deductions. Tax is to be deducted on the basis of the information entered in the Articles. It should be clearly understood that the Master is not permitted to enter into dispute with a seaman as to the amount deducted where this is in accordance with the coding appearing in the ArticlesBOARD OF INLAND REVENUE CIRCULAR 5M. CIRCULAR TO MASTERS, OFFICERS AND SEAMEN OF MERCHANT SHIPS DEDUCTION OF INCOME TAX FROM SEAMEN’S EARNINGS 1. Introductory 1 his Circular brings up-to-date the arrangements relating to the deduction of tax from the wages of sea-going personnel of the Merchant Navy. Circulars iM, 2 M and 3 M are cancelled. The arrangements have been agreed between the Board of Inland Revenue, the Ministry of 1 ransport and the National Maritime Board and operate on and after 6 th July, 1947- (As regards arrangements affecting codings, these will apply to all Articles opened on and after 6 th July, 1947 .) The provisions of the scheme are covered by statutory regulations made by the Board of Inland Revenue under Section 2 of the Income Tax (Employments) Act, 1943 . The regulations provide for the de duction of tax due by a seaman* from his wages at the time they are paid. The amount of tax deducted will depend partly on the sea man's rate of pay and partly on his family circumstances. The tax deducted will be remitted to the Collector of Taxes at Cardiff and credited to the seaman, but he will remain liable for any sum by which it falls short of an assessment based on total earnings for the period, while any overpayment will be repayable. He will still be required to make an annual return of his total income from all sources and a claim for any allowance to which he may be entitled to H.M. Inspector of Taxes in the usual way (see paragraph 4 ). He will receive an annual statement showing his tax position. 2. Personnel to whom the Scheme Applies The scheme applies to all sea-going personnel of the Merchant Navy (including Masters, Apprentices and Cadets) in the foreign-going, home or coasting trade to whom the National Maritime Board Rate of Pay Agreements apply (either as standard or minimum rates), in cluding seamen serving on vessels opening Articles abroad and adopting the said Agreements, except the following: — (a) Personnel on Articles at nominal rates. (b) Personnel whose Agreement (or other contract of service) provides that they shall remain outside the United Kingdom for a minimum period of three years. (c) Crews of vessels owned by certain Railways. The scheme also applies to personnel of the Merchant Navy who are employed on a ship “ off Articles ” (see para. 10 (c)). As regards radio officers, see para. 12 . 3 . Non-Resident Seamen A seaman who satisfies the Board of Inland Revenue that he is not resident in the United Kingdom may claim repayment of any tax deducted from his earnings in the foreign-going trade. A note of the circumstances in which a seaman is regarded as non-resident and a simple form for claiming repayment can be obtained from any * As used in this Notice, ' Seaman ' means any person to whom the scheme applies—including a Master—(see para. 2 ).I Mercantile Marine Office, from H.M. Inspector of Taxes, Cardiff Marine, or from the Organisations mentioned in para. 19. In making a claim for the first time, Section A of this form should he completed at the time of signing on and either handed to the Superintendent or to the Organisation for transmission to the Inspector of Taxes, or sent to the Inspector direct. At the time of paying off when tax is deducted Section B of the form should be completed and handed to the Superintendent to be certified and sent to the Inspector. Once a claim has been admitted, it is only necessary on subsequent occasions to complete Section B of the form at the time of signing off unless the facts concerning the seaman’s residence change, when Section A should again be completed. 4. Inland Revenue Offices % Remittances of tax deducted should be sent, together with the accompanying returns, to the Collector of Taxes, Cardiff ' B ” Collection, 8-11, Hills Terrace, Cardiff. All other matters will be dealt with in the offices of H.M. Inspector of Taxes, Cardiff Marine District, Llandaff, Cardiff. 5. Deduction Tables Tables are provided showing the Income Tax payable on an appro priate range of income in varying family circumstances (single, married, married with one child, etc.). Separate f ables are provided showing the tax payable per month and per six days for use where wages are payable on a monthly basis. Tables are also provided showing the tax payable for 1 to 7 days for use where wages are paid on a weekly basis. Further Tables are provided showing the tax payable for 1 to 30 days where wages are based on weekly rates but are paid at irregular intervals. Tables showing the tax payable per month and per week are also provided for use in regard to earnings “ off Articles ” (see para. 10 (c)). 6. Coding The Tables contain a separate scale of deductions for each of the following ten types of case, each type being given a descriptive coding as shown. Type of Case Coding Single man or widower without dependants ... ... S. Single man or widower with 1 to 3 dependants ... ... S.i. to S.3. Married man with wife and no other dependant ... M. Married man with wife and one other dependant ... M.i. •Married man with wife and 2 to 5 other dependants ... M.2. to M.5. The Notes at the end of this Circular explain how to determine the correct coding. Personnel described in paragraph 2 (6) of this Circular will be distinguished in the Articles by the letters “ O.U.K.” to indi cate that no tax is to be deducted. 7. Seaman's Family Circumstances When a seaman (other than a Radio Officer in the employment of a Wireless Company) signs on, he should give details of his family circumstances (Single, Married, Married with one child, etc.). New Income Tax Codings If ihe Seaman’s Income Tax coding has not already been entered in hi&gt;. British Seaman’s Identity Card, or if the date of the coding is more than two years prior to the date of signing the Articles, or ifmm 7 O ^ 4 ) 3 his verbal declaration indicates that his family circumstances have changed since the coding was granted, he will be given a form of declaration (Form P8o(M)) for completion prior to signing on. The Mercantile Marine Superintendent will see that the declaration is com plete and enter the corresponding coding in the Identity Card and in the Articles. Tax will be deducted accordingly. If the seaman ignores or refuses to complete the form, he will be coded “ S ”—Single man without dependants. Copies of Form P8o(M) are available at all Mercantile Marine Offices and Offices of the Seamen’s Organisations. Transitional arrangements for the period to $th April, 1948 As regards a seaman who signs Articles before 6th April, 1948, and whose British Seaman’s Identity Card does not contain a coding cer tificate, a coding will be entered in the Articles as in the past on the basis of his verbal declaration, and tax will be deducted from the earnings of that voyage accordingly. At the same time he will be given a form of declaration (Form P8o(M)) for completion and return forthwith if practicable, but in any case before the end of the voyage. When the form is completed, it should be handed to the Mercantile Marine Superintendenjt or, where it is completed during the voyage, to the Master or other officer authorised by him, who will pass it to the Superintendent at the end of the voyage. Ihe Superintendent will then see that the declaration is complete and will enter a corre sponding coding in the British Seaman’s Identity Card on the basis of which tax will be deducted from subsequent earnings. The issue of Form P8o(M) will be noted in the Articles and if it is not completed before the pay off, the Superintendent will enter Code “ S ” in the British Seaman’s Identity Card. This coding will there after apply until a declaration form is completed and an amended coding granted by a Superintendent. A seaman who does not sign Articles between 6th July, 1947, and 6th April, 1948, and has not otherwise obtained a coding certificate should complete and return a form P8o(M) when next signing Articles. Existing Coding available If the date of the coding entered in the Seaman’s Identity Card is not more than two years prior to the date of signing the Articles and there is no change in his family circumstances, this coding will be embodied in the Articles and tax will be deducted accordingly. Change of circumstances during the currency of Articles Where a seaman’s circumstances change during the currency of Articles he should complete an application for the alteration of his Income Tax coding on form P8o(M)-i (taking the place of form C.R.S.136) which is obtainable from the Master or from any Mercantile Marine Office or Office of the Seamen’s Organisations. The completed form should be handed to the Master (or other officer authorised by him) and in accordance with the instructions on the form deposited with the Articles when they are next deposited with the proper authority. Section A of the form (the declaration of personal circum stances) together with Section B will be detached, kept with the Articles and handed at the end of the voyage to the Mercantile Marine Superintendent, who will enter an amended coding in the British Seaman’s Identity Card at the time of pay off. Sections C and D of the form will be dealt with as in the past.4 No liability rests on the Master for any mis-statement made by a seaman and tax should be deducted on the basis of the coding entered in the Articles. If, however, there is any error in the coding it will not affect the amount of tax which the seaman will ultimately have to pay as the assessment will be made on the correct basis. It should be clearly understood that the Master is not permitted to enter into dispute with a seaman as to the amount deducted where this is in accordance with the coding as appearing in the Articles. Any question should be raised with the Inspector’s office either direct or through one of the Organisations mentioned in paragraph 19. 8. Restriction of Advances, etc. Advances, issues of slops and wines, etc., and any claims against pay (other than under a Notice of Attachment) must be restricted so as to leave payable after deduction of allotments, forfeitures and fines a wages credit equal at least to the amount of tax payable in his case according to the Table. 9. Notice of Attachment, i.e., Notice to withhold wages in respect of relief to a seaman’s family. If the balance of wages due is not sufficient to cover both the Income Tax to be deducted and the amount payable under a Notice of Attach ment, the latter amount must be paid first and the tax deduction reduced accordingly. 10. Deduction of Tax from Wages (а) Seamen paid at monthly rates. When the balance of wages is paid to the seaman, the instruc tions given in the Monthly Table should be followed. In respect of each complete month on Articles or period of Special Payment when discharged sick abroad, or period when in receipt of Ship wreck Unemployment Indemnity, the tax shown in the column headed “ Month ” for the appropriate coding will be deducted. In the case of an uncompleted month, the tax shown in the column headed “ 6 day ” for the appropriate coding will be deducted for each complete period of 6 days. If the payment of wages relates to a period of over 11 months on continuous Articles, only 11 months’ deductions should be made for each 12 months of the period of Articles. (б) Seamen paid at weekly rates When any payment of wages is made at any time during the currency of the Articles, the amount of tax shown in the daily I able as applicable to the seaman’s case must be deducted in respect of each day for which wages are paid. (c) Port Pay (i.e., earnings “ Off Articles ”). (i) Tax will be deducted from port pay after that for the first month of such employment. Where employment “ off Articles” continues for more than one month,' tax will be deducted for the period in excess of one month in accordance with the Tax Tables provided. (ii) When the seaman has completed one month’s employment with an employer, the employer will ascertain his Income Tax coding from his Seaman’s Identity Card.Mp&amp;MKCMa 5 (iii) When the employment ceases and the last payment made is for a broken period, i.e., less than a week or less than a month, tax shall be deducted according to the instructions con tained in the special Tax Table provided for this purpose. (iv) Port pay referred to above includes - all remuneration paid for the period in excess of the first month, i.e., includes over time. etc. n. Basis of Deduction of Tax Except in the case of employment “ off Articles,” where tax is deducted from the total earnings, tax deductions are only to be made in respect of the rate of pay on Articles. No account should be taken of overtime, leave pay (whether on or off Articles) or pay in lieu of leave or of sick leave paid in the United Kingdom. Shipwreck Unemployment Indemnity and Special Payment will be subject to deduction. The exclusion of an item from deduction does not mean that it is exempt from tax. 12. Radio Officers In the case of Radio Officers in the employment of a Wireless Company, tax will be deducted by that Company in accordance with the appropriate coding. In the case of Radio Officers not in the employment of a Wireless Company, tax should be deducted when the balance of wages is paid, in the same way as for other members of the crew. 13. Changes in Rate of Pay If the seaman’s rate of pay is changed on promotion or derating or from any other cause, or if the seaman’s coding is altered during the currency of the Articles (see para. 7), tax should be deducted as follows: — Seamen paid at monthly rates First calculate the tax to be deducted at the original rate of deduction for the whole period of the Articles, then add or subtract the difference between the original and new rates of deduction for each month and period .of 6 days during which any change operates. Seamen paid at weekly rates The deduction for the period before the change and for the period during which any change operates must be calculated separately and added together. 14. Desertion When calculating the balance of a deserter’s wages, no deduction should be made in respect of Income Tax. Where the balance of a deserter’s wages is deposited with the proper officer in accordance with Section 28 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1906, that officer must be notified at the time as to the Income Tax deduction which would have been made if the seaman had been paid off at the date of desertion. In other cases, a careful note must be kept of the appro priate Income Tax deduction. Where the balance of wages is sub sequently paid to the deserter, the appropriate amount of tax must be deducted at the time of payment and duly remitted to the Collector of Taxes at Cardiff.■■■■■ G j- Payment of Tax to Collector and Return of Earnings The employer should pay to the Collector at Cardiff the tax deducted from each seaman’s wages. The payment should be accompanied oy a Return of Total Earnings (including overtime and all other earnings from which tax was not deducted) and of the amount of tax deducted. As regards earnings on Articles, the returns must include all persons whose names appear in the Articles (except Radio Officers in the •employment of Wireless Companies), including persons from whose wa*es tax is not deducted. The appropriate form of return (Form 46M) can be obtained at Mercantile Marine Offices. If at the time of paying off it is desired to dispose immediately of the tax deducted, the completed form of return, together with the amount deducted, may be lodged with the Superintendent for transmission to the Collector at Cardiff (this arrangement only applies where the lodgment is made at the time of paying off). Similarly, where the Articles are closed abroad, the completed return and the tax deducted may be lodged with the Consul or Shipping Master. As regards all earnings ‘ 1 Off Articles and any other earnings not included in the voyage returns mentioned above, the employer must make a separate return on form 46M or such other form as may have been agreed. Returns on form 46M which include earnings from which tax has been deducted should be sent, together with the tax deducted, to the Collector at Cardiff. Returns relating exclusively to earnings from which tax is not deducted should be sent to the Inspector of Taxes, Cardiff Marine District. 16. Payment will be made as follows: — (a) Monthly Ships. Within one month of the closing of Articles (or, in the case of Articles closed abroad, as soon as practicable). (b) Weekly Ships. Not later than the 14th of the month following the month in which the tax is deducted. (c) Employment ' Off Articles.' Not later than the 14th of the month following the month in which the tax is deducted. 17. Notice of Assessment to be sent to Seamen Once a year, H.M. Inspector of Taxes, Cardiff Marine District, will send each seaman from whose earnings tax has been deducted a notice showing the amount of his total earnings and all allowances, e.g., Personal Allowances, Life Insurance Relief, Building Society Interest Relief, etc., due to him for the Income Tax year from 6th April to 5th April. The notice will also show the total amount of tax payable on those earnings, the amount of tax deducted and the amount of any tax still owing from or to him, as the case may be. Where a voyage commenced before and ended after 5th April, the earnings and the tax deducted as shown in the notice will be the amounts apportioned to that part of the voyage which falls in the year of assessment. Ihe assessment will take account of any incorrect codings, etc. 18. Repayment of Over-Deductions Where an annual statement shows an overpayment, a simple form will ordinarily be enclosed with it on which the seaman can apply for the repayment which appears to be due to him.Where there is a substantial diminution of a seaman’s earnings as compared with sea-going rates, e.g., owing to a prolonged period of sickness or unemployment, or where he becomes entitled to further allowances during the Income Tax year, he may be entitled to repay ment of part of the tax already deducted. In such a case, the seaman may apply to H.M. Inspector of Taxes, Cardiff Marine District, or obtain the advice of his Organisation (see next paragraph). In any case, the matter will be put right at the end of the year in the assess ment on his total earnings as explained in 17 above. 19. Masters must make the deductions strictly in accordance with the above instructions. A seaman who challenges the correctness of the deduction should be referred to H.M. Inspector of laxes, Cardiff Marine District, or to one of the following Organisations, where he will be able to get help or advice on Income Tax matters. The Amalgamated Engineering Union. The Marine Engineers’ Association. The Mercantile Marine Service Association. The Navigators' &amp; Engineer Officers’ Union. The Radio Officers’ Union. The Electrical Trades Union. The Boilermakers’ and Iron and Steel Shipbuilders’ Society. The Plumbers’, Glaziers’ &amp; Domestic Engineers’ Union. The National Union of Seamen. NOTES ON DETERMINATION OF CODING These notes explain how to determine a seaman’s coding for tax deduction purposes. They do not set out all the conditions governing the Income Tax allowances for children and other dependants, and accordingly the fact that a seaman is allotted a particular coding is not conclusive evidence that he is actually entitled to the corresponding Income Tax allowances in arriving at his Income Tax liability. (a) A married man whose wife is living with him or is wholly main tained by him by means of voluntary allowances comes under Code M. for tax deduction purposes. Everyone else—whether single, widowed, divorced or separated—comes under Code S. (b) Children. A child under 16 (or a child over 16 who is still being educated) counts as a dependant for tax deduction purposes. This also applies to step children and adopted children. (c) Housekeeper. , , . , (i) Seaman who is a widower. A resident housekeeper counts as a dependant for tax deduction purposes. (ii) Other seamen under Code S. If a seaman is entitled to an allowance for a dependent child and a female person is resident with and maintained or e/nployed by him to look after the child, the female person counts as a dependant for tax deduction purposes. (hi) Married seaman under Code M. If a seaman’s wife is per- manentlv incapacitated and a ’female person is resident with and maintained or employed by him to look after his dependent child or children, the female person counts as a dependant for tax deduction purposes.(57335) We 14016 — 5940 60m 6/47 8 (d) Dependent Relatives. A relative of the seaman or his wife counts as a dependent for tax deduction purposes if the relative is maintained by the seaman and is aged or infirm. If the relative.is the widowed mother of the seaman or of his wife, she need not be aged or infi rm. A relative whose own income is over £120 does not count as a dependant. (e) Non-Resident seamen. The “ O.U.K.” marking must be con fined to seamen w'ho qualify as non-residents under para. 2 (b) above, i.e., those whose Agreement or other contract of service provides that they shall remain outside the United Kingdom for a minimum period of three years.

CIRCULAR TO MASTERS, OFFICERS AND SEAMEN OF MERCHANT SHIPS CHANGES IN THE PROCEDURE FOR DEDUCTION OF TAX FROM WAGES—“ PAY AS YOU EARN ” (1) Changes in “ Pay as you Earn ' for Seamen The original Pay as you Earn ' scheme for seamen has now been m» operation for over three years and the following changes are being made as a result of the experience gained. (а) Monthly rates of pay—The 15 day rule will become a 6 day rule, and it will apply to all payments made on or after 6th July, 1947, in general to the extent that they consist of earnings since 5th April, 1947. (б) As regards Articles opened on and after 6th July, 1947, the number of codes will be reduced from twelve to ten as codes S.4 and S.5 will not be required. The Non-Resident marking “ N.R.” will no longer be granted. In certain cases a new marking “ O.U.K.” will be given instead. (c) When next signing on Articles after 6th July, 1947, you will be given a simple form on which to claim your personal allowances. (d) Special Payment following discharge abroad for sickness, injury, etc., will be subject to deduction of tax in respect of payment accruing on and after 6th July, 1947. (e) On and after 6th July, 1947 * t ax will be deducted from wages earned “ off Articles ” after the first month. Details of these changes are given in the following paragraphs. (2) 6 day Rule As a means of reducing the underpayments which have arisen in the past from the existing method of calculating tax deductions in the case of monthly rates of pay, the tax to be deducted in an in complete month will be calculated for each complete period of six days instead of for a complete period of fifteen days only. (3) Personal allowances for codings In cases of special hardship, e.g., where you are entitled to allow ances in excess of those represented by Codes S.3 or M.5, repayment may be claimed during the year from the Inspector of Taxes, Cardiff Marine District, either direct or through your Organisation. The “ Account of Wages ' must be attached to the letter claiming ( 4 ) Non-Residence If your Agreement provides that you shall remain outside the United Kingdom for a minimum period of three years, the Articles will be noted “ O.U.K.” and no tax will be deducted from your earnings. If you claim for any other reason to be regarded as non resident in the United Kingdom, you must nevertheless declare your personal circumstances in order that a coding may be given you, and tax will be deducted from your earnings in accordance with this coding.When you decluic your personal circumstances for the first time, you should ask for a “ Non-Residence Claim Form ” (Form R43M), which is obtainable from the Mercantile Marine Office, from your Organisation or from H.M. Inspector of Taxes. Section A of the form should then be completed and handed to the Superintendent or to your Organisation for transmission to the Inspector, or sent to the Inspector direct. At the time you are paid off and tax is deducted, Section B (which is an application for a refund) should be completed and handed to the Superintendent to be certified and sent to the Inspector. Once you have had your non-residence claim admitted, you need only complete Section B on subsequent voyages, until the circumstances of your residence change, or you are asked for further information. (5) Coding Certificate When you sign on Articles for the first time after 6th July, 1947 (provided it is before 6th April, 1948), you will be coded in the Articles as in the past on the basis of your verbal declaration. In addition, you will be given a simple form of declaration to complete showing whether you are single or married, particulars of any children and the name of any housekeeper or dependent relatives for whom you claim an allowance. This form must be completed forthwith if practicable but in any case before the end of the voyage, and handed to the Mercantile Marine Superintendent, or (where it is completed during the voyage) to the Master or other officer authorised by him, who will pass it to the Superintendent prior to pay-off. On receiving the form, the Superintendent will see that it is complete and will note on it the code corresponding to your personal circumstances. At the same time, he will enter a certificate in your British Seaman’s Identity Card stating the Income Tax coding granted and will send the form of declaration to the Inspector at Cardiff. It is important that this form be completed and handed over as otherwise the Super intendent will enter Code “ S ” {single man without dependants) in your Identity Card. The coding granted will last for two years or until your circum stances change, when you must complete another declaration. When signing on for another voyage, the coding noted in your Identity Card will be embodied in the Articles; it will be checked by asking you to say what your circumstances are at the time of signing on. A seaman who does not sign on between 6th July, 1947, and 6th April, 1948, and who has not otherwise obtained a coding certificate, should complete a form of declaration when next signing on Articles. (6) Pay “ off Articles ” If you are “ working by ” a ship in port, you will be asked to show the coding certificate on your British Seaman’s Identity Card and tax will be deducted from all earnings after those for the first month of employment “ off Articles.” You will remain liable to tax on earnings during the first month, which will be included in your assessment for the year. A complete and up-to-date description of the Seaman’s Income Tax deduction scheme is contained in Circular 5M, copies of which may be obtained from any Mercantile Marine Office, Seamen’s Organisa tion, Merchant Navy Establishment Office, or from H.M.

APPLICATION BY A MEMBER OF THE MERCHANT NAVY FOR AN INCOME TAX CODING This form must be used only in respect of changes in circumstances which have occurred during the currency of the Articles, or to correct an error in the copying of a seaman’s coding from his B.S.I.C- into the Articles. The seaman should complete Section A and the Declaration overleaf and hand the form to the Master. Penalties If any person, for the purpose of obtaining any allowance, reduction, rebate or repayment in respect of Income Tax, either for himself or for any other person, knowingly makes any false statement or false representation, he is liable, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months with hard labour. INSTRUCTIONS TO MASTERS, SUPERINTENDENTS OF MERCANTILE MARINE OFFICES, ETC. (1) No alteration may be made by a Master in a seaman’s Income Tax Coding once this has been entered in the Articles. A Master may not deduct tax on the basis of any code other than that entered in the Articles. The Master may not alter the coding in the Articles. (2) The Master on receiving from a seaman this form with Section A overleaf properly completed should deposit the form with the Articles when the Articles are next deposited with the proper authority (i.e., a Superintendent of a Mercantile Marine Office or a British Consular Officer or Shipping Master abroad in a port other than the port at which the seaman is discharged). The Superintendent or other proper officer, if satisfied that a change in the coding is justified, will make the appropriate alteration in the Articles in accordance with the rules in paragraph 4 below, and will complete Sections C and D overleaf, returning Sections A, B and C to the Master with the Articles and forwarding Section D to the Registrar General of Shipping and Seamen, Llantrisant Road, Llandaff, Cardiff, for attachment to the Office copy of the Articles. The Master on receipt of the form with Section C overleaf duly completed will amend the rate of Income Tax deduction with effect from the date determined by the Superintendent or other proper authority to correspond with the authorised alteration in coding provided that he is made aware of the alteration at least seven days before the seaman is to be discharged. Section C should be attached to the Articles. On arrival at a port in the United Kingdom at which the seaman is discharged, the Master will hand Sections A and B to the Superintendent, to enable the Superintendent to complete Section B and enter the amended coding in the seaman’s B.S.I.C. at the time of paying off. The Superintendent will then send Sections A and B to H.M. Inspector of Taxes, Cardiff Marine District, Greenwood Road, Llandaff, Cardiff. (If the seaman is discharged abroad, Sections A and B should be handed to him in order that he may have the certificate in his B.S.I.C. amended on his return to the United Kingdom.) (3) If the seaman claims that he should have been coded “ O.U.K.” no change to his Coding is to be approved. He should be instructed to claim an adjustment by way of repayment from H.M. Inspector of Taxes, Cardiff Marine District, Greenwood Rd., Llandaff, Cardiff. (4) The Superintendent or other proper Officer must observe the following rules when deciding the effective date of a change in the Income Tax Coding ; (i) Foreign Going Articles, (a) If the change is necessitated by an error made when signing the Articles then the change must be made effective from the date of engagement ; (b) If the change is necessitated by an alteration in family circumstances entitling the seaman to a more favourable coding, then the change in coding must be made effective from 6 April previous to the alteration in family circumstances, or from the date of engagement whichever is the later. (ii) Home Trade Articles. The change must be made effective from the day following the last pay day or from the previous 6 April whichever is the later. (5) Supplies of this form will be obtainable at all Mercantile Marine Offices. A small supply will be handed by the Superintendent to a Master when the Articles are opened.

VOYAGES AT MONTHLY RATES OF PAY (WITH FREE FOOD) Notes 1. Code indicating family circumstances. The Table contains a separate scale of deductions for each of the following 10 types of case, each type being given a descriptive coding as shown— Type of case Coding Single man or widower without dependants S „ with one to three dependants S1 to S3 Married man with wife and no other dependant .... M „ „ „ one other dependant .... M1 „ „ two to five other dependants M2 to M5 If the letters “ OUK ” appear in the articles instead of one of the codings listed above, no tax is to be deducted from the wages of the seaman in question. 2. Period of deduction. The amount of tax shown in the Table under the column headed “ Month ” must be deducted in respect of each complete month on Articles, or period when in receipt of Shipwreck Unemployment Indemnity or Special Payment (when discharged sick abroad). In an uncompleted month, the amount of tax shown in the column headed “ Six days must be deducted for each complete period of six days. If the payment of wages relates to a period of over 11 months on continuous Articles, only 11 months deductions should be made for each 12 months of the period of Articles. 3. How to ascertain the amount of deduction. The monthly rate of pay on Articles is shown in the table, and the tax to be deduct ed in any individual case will be the “ Month ” and “ Six day ’ amounts shown against the rate appropriate to that case multiplied by the number of months and complete periods of six days respectively, for which wages are paid. Thus, for an A.B. coded “ S (/.e. a single man without dependants) on Articles for 2 months 21 days at a rate of pay of £24 per month, the deduction would be twice the amount shown against £24 in the “ S ” column headed “ Month (i.e. twice £2 5s.), plus three times the amount shown in the adjacent column headed “ Six days ” (i.e. three times 9s.), making a total deduction of £5 17s. No deduction would be made for the odd period of three days. If a Seaman’s Wages Calculator is in use, the tax to be deducted in this case can be ascertained by reading off 2 months 18 days at £2 5s., i.e. the tax shown in the column headed “ Month.” No account is to be taken of overtime, leave pay whether on or off Articles, pay in lieu of leave, or sick pay in the United Kingdom. 4. Where exact rate of pay does not appear in Table. For monthly pay below £60 where the actual monthly rate is not shown, the next rate below that being paid to the seaman should be taken, e.g., if the rate of pay is £25 12s. 6d. a month, it should be treated as £25 10s. Od. for tax deduction purposes. For monthly pay exceeding £60, where the exact monthly rate and tax deduction are not given, on account of the £5 or £10 steps in the Table, the correct deduction should be obtained by apportionment, working to the next lower sum of £1 in the case of fractions of a £. Thus, to arrive at the tax appropriate to a rate of £124 15s. Od. per month, add to the tax applicable to £120 4/10ths of the difference between that tax and the tax on £130. 5. Changes in rate of pay or coding. If the seaman’s rate of pay is changed on promotion or derating or there is any other change in the rate of remuneration, or if the seaman’s coding is altered during the currency of the Articles, the deduction should be made as follows— First calculate the deduction at the original rate of deduction for the whole period of the Articles. Then add or subtract, the difference between the old and new rates of deduction for each month or period of six days during which any change operates. 6. Disputes concerning deductions. Tax is to be deducted on the basis of the information entered in the Articles. It should be clearly understood that the Master is not permitted to enter into dispute with a seaman as to the amount deducted where this is in accordance with the coding appearing in the Articles.TAX TO BE DEDUCTED FROM WAGESMinistry of Transport, Berkeley Square House London, W.1* Circular No. 1831. 11th June, 194-8.

In future the payment of compensation for loss of effects due to marine causes is a matter entirely for the shipowners, or their agents, to whom any applications for compensation in such cases should be referred. Compensation will, however, continue to be payable under the Compensation to Seamen (War Damage to Effects) Scheme in cases where loss or damage to war causes is sustained on a ship registered in the United Kingdom, Nuwfoundland or the Colonies, or a ship registered in India under the M. S.A. 1894- 1940. The only cases of this kind which are nov; likely to arise are those due to a ship striking a mine.

An agreement has been reached by the National Maritime loard under \M...ch a 'Merchant Navy Established Service Scheme' will come into fo.ice on the 31st March.

So far, as Dominion, Colonial and foreign seamen arriving in the United Kingdom are concerned, the introduction of the Established Service Scheme will considerably lessen the possibility of their being offered sea going employment and attention is drawn to the instructions in Ministry of transport Circular No. 1810 (Consuls No. 111, Colonial No. 109) with regard to the insertion of the repatriation clause in the Articles of Agreement when Colonial and other seamen are engaged outside the United .kingdom. 4* Discharge from the Merchant Navy abroad .

These sear.ien axe sent to their xxoper return port in India either as passengers or under conveyance orders. Apparently, in Host cases the relevant pay documents, e.g. portage bills, advance sheets, etc., do not acccnpany the men, being sent by post to the shipping agents at the proper return oort. it frequently happens that these documents arrive after the men, and the resultant delay in making settlement causes considerable hardship to the seamen concerned*-2- The G-overnnent of India have suggested that, tr avoid such delays in settlenent, the relevant docur.ients (originals or certified cci^ies) should always accompany the men when they are repatriated as passengers and that, as a safety measure, copies'or originals of the documents should also do sent by fast mail to the shipping agents at the proper return port in India* Officers should note that copies of any pay documents should first be certified before transmission. It has also been suggested that a similar procedure should be adopted in the case of seamen repatriated under conveyance orders which should, in every case, be properly completed. Officers are, therefore, requested to act as above in regard to any Indian seamen sent to India and to ensure that local shipping agents are instructed to take similar action when repatriating Indian seamen as passengers. .-'■N 1-543/45 W.J* KILLHIG-B^CK.- 1 - Circular 1771- Consul 72.

N.A. GUTTERY Principal Assistant Secretary 18th June, 1944, - 2 - *Circular 1767 (Revised). Consul 69. Cftlonial 67. Ministry of War Transport, Berkeley Square House, London, W.i. November, 1945 . INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE USE OF H.M. CONSULS AND OFFICERS IN THE DOMINIONS, COLONIES AND PROTECTORATES. Continuity of pay, Continuity of allotments, and cabling arrangements in connection with seamen left abroad. Consolidated Instructions, cancelling Circulars 1734; 1736; 1738 (revised); 1746, 1751 and 1786, with amendments and amplifications. NOTE.—It is emphasised that the purposes for which these cabling arrangements were devised remain in force without modification, and that Officers should continue, until further notice, to report promptly and fully on the lines indicated herein. ( 1 ) The purpose of the instructions contained in the above circulars was to ensure that the fullest possible information regarding seamen whose service terminates abroad, is promptly available in this country in order:— (a) to enable allotments when in issue to continue (in whole or in part) without break while wages, from one source or another, aro accruing to the credit of the seaman concerned, and thus prevent hardship to dependants, and (b) to provide the Ministry, Shipowners and others interested, with immediate information as to the causes and circumstances of British and AJlied seamen leaving and joining ships abroad, and to complete the record of their movements. ( 2 ) Since the inception of the scheme important changes in prac tice and growth in scope have occurred, and the opportunity is now taken to cover in one document the intended purposes of Sealot channels of communication in order that their use may be clearly understood. ( 3 ) Notwithstanding that the right to wages of seamen left behind abroad by reason of sickness or injury terminates, under the provisions of Section 158 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894 , on the date of the official certificate sanctioning their discharge. Shipowners in the United Kingdom agreed to extend their obligations under Section 34 ( 1 ) of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1906 , by making a Special Pay ment to sick or injured officers and seamen discharged abroad after 1 st January, 1942 , from ships to which that Section applies. This Special Payment is limited to a maximum of 12 weeks (not three calendar months). ( 4 ) The above concession has, in practice, been extended to seamen serving in most vessels operated, controlled or managed from the United Kingdom even if not strictly covered by the Essential Work (M.N.) Order. It also covers seamen normally domiciled in the United Kingdom who are employed on Canadian ships operated by the Park Steamship Co., Ltd., of Montreal, whether obtained from a Manning Pool or from the charge of Consuls or other officers abroad. ( 5 ) Although cases of seamen who sustain injury while not in the service of the ship, are not covered by Section 34 ( 1 ) of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1906 , Shipowners are generally giving such men the benefit of the Special Payment provided the injury is not due to the seaman’s wilful act or own misbehaviour. MERCHANT SHIPPING AND SEAMEN. SPECIAL SICK PAYMENTS.( 6 ) Special Payment does not apply to men employed on “Asiatic ” or “ West African ', etc., agreements at rates of pay below those prescribed by the National Maritime Board, or to men serving on “ Asiatic ’’ agreements which, because of the expiration of the original agreements opened in the East, have been signed on at ports outside Asia. ( 7 ) The Special Payment is normally paid at the rate of wages shown in the Articles, excluding Seafarer’s War Risk Money but it does not apply where seamen are dicharged on account of war injury, etc., and where the illness is due to the seaman’s own act or default (V.D. excepted). The amount paid is taken into account in deter mining the amount, if any, of Workmen’s Compensation due in lump sum settlements or fatal cases. ( 8 ) The Special Payment is conditional on satisfactory medical evidence being provided that the seamen continues to be unfit. The obligation to produce that evidence rests upon the seaman, and all medical certificates should be certified by the “ proper authority ”. ( 9 ) It is also a condition of the Special Payment that the seaman at once reports to the “ proper authority ’’ on discharge from the hospital abroad. ( 10 ) Special Payment is conditional on satisfactory medical evi dence being provided that unfitness continues and that the Special Payment will be discontinued by the Owners in any case where it is reported to them that a seaman is retarding his recovery by hot complying with the rules of the hospital in which he is undergoing treatment. This matter has come to notice particularly in connection with the treatment of V.D., the complaint having been made that treatment has to be prolonged far beyond what is necessary on account of the conduct of the patients. (n) Consuls and other Officers overseas should therefore request the authorities of the hospitals in which seamen are undergoing treatment to report immediately any case in which a seaman is retarding his recovery by not adhering to the hospital rules. On receipt of such a report the Consul or other Officer overseas should send a Sealot telegram giving brief details of the case and recom mending the stoppage of Special Payment. ( 12 ) In flagrant cases of non-compliance with hospital rules, a full report on the matter should, in addition, be sent to Marine B. Divi sion of the Ministry. ( 13 ) U.K. Merchant Navy Reserve Pool Pay. When a seaman subject to the Essential Work (Merchant Navy) Order, 1942 , recovers from an illness or injury which necessitated his discharge 'from his ship, he is, provided he is available for further employment, eligible for Reserve Pool pay, at a rate agreed by the N.M.B. from which, so far as that pay permits, the allotment is con tinued. Such Pool pay continues until the seaman is re-employed in a ship or is repatriated to his proper return port. ( 14 ) It is desirable to emphasise that United Kingdom Merchant Navy Reserve Pool pay, which follows on recovery from an illness or injury, applies only if the seaman concerned is subject to the Essential Work (M.N.) Order, 1942 , and who while ashore in the period he is absent from the U.K. remains in charge of, and obeys, the instructions of the “ proper authority ’’. A seaman forfeits his right to Pool pay if he accepts shore employment, or if he refuses a suitable offer by the Consul, or other Officer abroad, of an engagement in a British ship or in an Allied vessel chartered, requisitioned or otherwise under the control of H.M. United Kingdom or Canadian Governments, or if he engages in a ship not so controlled without the authority of the— [)roper officer He similarly forfeits his right to Pool pay if he refuses to enter a Manning Pool abroad. Seamen joining a Manning Pool outside the United Kingdom of course become entitled to pay from that Pool from the date of entry, and their pay from the Reserve Pool in the U.K. ceases from that date. (15) Masters, Officers and Seamen whose vessels are lost or wrecked by War or Marine Peril. Ministry of War Transport Notice No. 246 deals with seamen in this category who will normally continue to receive shipwreck pay until they return to the U.K. or other proper teturn port or are offered alternative employment. (The notice also deals with seamen discharged abroad from their ship as a result of war injury, or war risk injury, who will receive shipwreck pay under similar conditions.) (16) Masters, Officers and Seamen whose Agreements provided for termination in the United Kingdom, but which are terminated abroad by lapse of time. Such men would normally remain on pay pending and during re patriation but, in present circumstances, each case is dealt with on its merits. ALLOTMENTS. (17) From the foregoing it will be seen that there is a considerable body of seamen whose allotments to dependants can be continued without break (in whole or in part), or can be reinstated following a break, from the time of departure from the U.K. until their return thereto, notwithstanding the fact that for reasons beyond their control, they are unable to complete the original voyage. On the other hand cessation of wages, and consequently allotments, must still occur in many cases, e.g. where seamen miss their ships; desert; are left behind in prison or taken ashore by the Naval or other authority at the port; are discharged by mutual consent and not at owner’s liability, from an illness or injury sustained by his own fault or misbehaviour or the maximum of 12 weeks of special payments is exceeded. In the two last mentioned cases, the seaman is eligible to be credited with Pool pay, if otherwise entitled, from the date of recovery from sickness or injury even though a period has occurred during which no payment was due. (18) The primary purpose of Sealot channels of communication is to provide information which will ensure that, while funds are accruing to the credit of seamen, payment of allotments will, without ex ception, be maintained, or be reinstated immediately funds are again available for that purpose. In this respect the scheme has operated with a very considerable measure of success. Consuls and Officers abroad will, however, appreciate that shipowners and the Shipping Federation are disbursing large sums in allotments solely on advices (circulated by the Registrar General of Shipping and Seamen) contained in Sealot cables. Failure to report promptly, changes re garding the position of a seaman (e.g. date on which he becomes fit, re-engagement or other disposal, particularly when such disposal entails cessation of pay from Shipowners or from Reserve Pool) still occurs in a minority of cases, with the result that allotments have continued to be paid, sometimes for a considerable period, after the responsibility for payment has ceased. At the best, recovery from the* debtors of sums overpaid in allotments presents considerable difficulty. Frequently the debts are irrecoverable and such failures result in claims on Government funds. It will be appreciated, there fore, how essential it is that each change which transfers responsibility for the payment of an allotment, which reduced the amount thereof, or which leaves no alternative but to terminate payment, should be reported immediately.4 ( 19 ) Consuls and Officers abroad will appreciate the general desir ability of maintaining allotments at the same level throughout the seaman’s absence from his proper return port, or as near to that level as the wages accruing permit. It is hoped that the allotment he makes on re-engagement abroad will be the same as that made on the vessel in which he previously served. Consuls and Officers abroad are, therefore, asked to endorse the particulars of that allotment, when known, on the seaman’s form C 12 or CC 6 at the time of dis charge. If the seaman is transferred from one port to another on form Ci 6 a; CCi 4 a or CC 14 (shipwreck) the allotment particulars should similarly be endorsed on the form. Thus in most cases when the men are subsequently signed on abroad, it should be possible for the particulars of the previous allotment to be endorsed on the new agree ment by the Consul or other Officer. This endorsement should be made in brackets beside the man’s signature and this should be done even if the man does not wish the allotment continued. It should in particular be done in cases where allotments are “ Nil ”. If the previous allotment is not known this should be stated. ( 20 ) Cases have occurred in which the Master of the ship in which a seaman is re-engaged has not been aware that an allotment was in issue by the owners of the ship in which the man previously served and consequently the seaman’s wages have, on discharge, been paid without deduction on that account. In other cases, double pay ments of allotment have occurred owing to the failure to report a re-engagement abroad, when both the seaman’s former owners and the new owners have paid allotments concurrently. In cases such as these it is difficult to resist claims from owners on the Ministry for repayment from public funds, when the sum involved is otherwise irrecoverable. Consuls and Officers abroad should therefore follow these instructions precisely, and assure themselves that the Master of a vessel in which a seaman, discharged abroad, may subsequently become engaged, whether at the port of discharge or at an inter mediate port during repatriation is aware of any allotment which may have previously been declared by the seaman concerned, and payment of w’hich is consequently being, or may be, continued. A new allot ment note should be made out in all cases of re-engagement, and if the seamen states that the allottee is unchanged from that of the preceding voyage it will merely be necessary to state in the relative Sealot cable “ allotment continues ”. If the allottee is new, particulars of the amount, frequency, date or dates of payment, and the name and full address of the allottee will be needed. If a man in respect of whom an allotment was previously in force refuses to make an A allotment, when engaging in another vessel, immediate information ^ is required, with if possible, the man’s reason for i*efusing. ( 21 ) In the case of men sent by Consuls, etc., to join a Manning Pool, a new allotment note will be completed at the time of entry into the Pool and the responsibility for this rests on the officer controlling the Pool. CABLING ARRANGEMENTS ( 22 ) Messages regarding movements of Merchant shipping in all areas may now be sent in plain language. Sealot communications should, therefore be transmitted direct to the Registrar of Shipping and Seamen, Cardiff, in one cable message, immediately following the occurrence to which it relates (thus eliminating, inter alia, the delay imposed by the former security time lag). ( 23 ) In order to simplify the procedure and to ensure that action is taken to secure a repetition of any cable that may fail to arrive, it is essential that all cables sent in accordance with these instructions should bear the prefix “ Sealot ” followed by a serial number andshould be addressed to “ Registrar Seamen, Cardiff Cabled enquiries from the Office of the Registrar General will bear the prefix “ Seareg ” followed by a consecutive serial number. GENERAL (24) The arrangements set out above involve no change in the instructions contained in Chapter X of Instructions to Consuls, 1930, and Chapter V of Instructions to Officers in British Dominions, Colonies and Possessions, 1927. (25) .Where seamen have been left behind abroad on the grounds of sickness or injury in cases which entitle them to the Special Payment, the Consul or Officer should impress on such Officers and seamen the necessity, in their own interest, of {a) Reporting as soon as they are discharged from hospital; (b) Producing a medical certificate if they are still unfit for further employment on discharge from the hospital; (c) Producing evidence of fitness immediately they have recovered and are available for re-engagement. (26) If the medical certificate of unfitness does not specify the period during which unfitness is likely to continue, the Consul or other Officer overseas should exercise his discretion as to requiring subsequent certificates. (27) Any medical certificate of unfitness produced by an officer or seaman should, if the Consul or other Officer overseas is satisfied therewith, be certified by his signature and the impression of his ink seal with the addition of the date of production to him. The certificate should then be attached to the Conveyance Order if the Officer or seaman is repatriated, or to the Articles of the ship in which he obtains further employment. (28) Cases have occurred of seamen being discharged sick and who become fit within two or three days but do not rejoin their ships. There must be a suspicion of malingering in such cases, some of which result in Pool pay being paid for considerable periods. F e attention of Consuls and other Officers is drawn to paragraphs 176-178 of Instructions to Consuls (88-90 of Instructions to Officers in Bntis Dominions, Colonies and Possessions), and they are reminded that a certificate for leaving behind should not be granted unless they are satisfied, on medical evidence if necessary, that the seaman will not be able to proceed with the ship. (29) The introduction of the Sealot system is not intended to relieve Masters and Agents from providing Owners with essential in formation although, normally, Sealot messages will be more expansive. Consuls and other Officers abroad should make this clear to Masters and agents and should, where necessary, assist the Masters or Agents to communicate to Owners without delay, essential information about officers and seamen left abroad. (30) The Consul or other Officer should not, in the absence of special instructions so to do, make any advance in excess of the amounts authorised in Circular 175 b. issued July, 1943 . 0 an () &lt;(I or seaman in respect of the Special Payment or Pool pay. All ad vances made to an officer or man under the arrangements in Circular 1756 should be reported in the relevant Sealot when the officer or man goes out of charge. (31) Some 650 cables naming more than 2,000 ships and dealing with up to 4,000 movements of seamen are received m the Office of the Registrar General of Shipping and Seamen each month The messages are edited; the Owners, Managers or Operators of the ships are identi fied as far as possible, each message is circulated on the day of receipt, except in the case of long messages which, because of the number of ships and men concerned require a wide circulation. It6 is desirable, therefore that as little time as possible should have to be expended on elucidation of details between receipt of the cables and despatch of the resultant messages to those concerned, and strict adherence to the following notes will not only ensure the minimum delay at Cardiff but will reduce very considerably the necessity for referring back to the port concerned for additional information:— Discharge (а) In reporting a seaman’s discharge it is essential that his Dis.A Number and capacity should invariably be given. It is unnecessary to prefix the number by the words “ Dis.A. No.” The number with any prefixed letter e.g. ‘‘ R ’ or ” S ” will suffice. If the seaman has no British Seaman’s Identity Card from which his Dis.A No. can be ascertained or if his number is not shown on the ship’s agreement, his full Christian names or initials and year and place of birth should be substituted. (б) The name and Official Number of the ship from which discharge has taken place should follow. If the ship is not on the British Register its nationality should be stated to facilititate indentification of the Managers, Operators or Allied Mission concerned. (c) Date and cause of discharge. Exact information as to cause of discharge is essential. If sickness, the nature of the complaint should be stated; if injury, its nature and whether or not it was sustained in the ship’s service; if not in the ship’s service it must be stated whether due to the seaman’s own fault or not. Cases of ‘‘ War Injury ” or ” War Risk Injury ” as defined in Ministry of War Trans port Notice No. 247 should, when the ship is not lost or wrecked, be identified. Crews coming into the Consul’s or Officer’s charge follow ing the loss of their vessel by enemy action or marine peril should of course be the subject of special cables, as indicated herein. Discharges by mutual consent abroad are, normally, foreign to the spirit of the Essential Work (Merchant Navy) Order, 1942. When one is un avoidable, however, the circumstances should be explained. Other causes of discharge should also be accompanied by brief particulars as each case suggests, e.g. the nature of misconduct; cause of im prisonment and duration of sentence; the circumstances in which a seaman missed his ship and the origin of the report of desertion. In the case of a desertion if new circumstances emerge later which satisfy the Consul or officer that the seaman had a good reason for not sailing with his ship (e.g. sudden sickness, or accident, while ashore with permission), the facts should be stated in a subsequent Sealot cable. . (d) Seamen sometimes remain in charge at a port for a protracted period. To obviate the necessity for enquiries at the request of the Shipping Federation or shipowner, officers are, in such cases, re quested to cable at monthly intervals, a report on the man’s progress if sick or injured, or otherwise the reason for delayed disposal. Arrival as passenger (e) The landing of a seaman travelling on a Conveyance Order and his subsequent departure should be reported giving the identification particulars indicated above. Disposal (/) A British Seaman should not normally be allowed to undertake shore employment abroad without the consent of the Ministry, but, if as a matter of expediency a man is allowed to accept such employ ment, its nature, probable duration and the reason which rendered the seaman’s release from his obligations desirable should be stated in the Sealot cable. Nor should he be allowed to engage in a foreign ship other than as indicated in paragraph (4).7 Engagement or embarkation (g) In reporting an engagement or embarkation in a ship for Con veyance, the name, rating and Dis.A No. of the seaman, the names of the ship from which previously discharged and that in .which the engagement or passage is taking place should be stated, together with the date of engagement or departure, and allotment particulars. The previous Sealot cable referring to the seaman should always be quoted. (h) Particular care should be taken to include particulars of allot ments in Sealot cables as indicated in the section dealing with allot ments (paras. 17-21). (32) Recovery of Health .—Seamen discharged from their ship from sickness or injury will in the majority of cases revert to Merchant Navy Reserve Pool pay, as from the date they become fit for sea service again (see paragraph (13)). It will be appreciated, therefore, that a cabled report of fitness must be made in all cases and when made, must state, without reservation, that the seaman Concerned was, on the date named fit, i.e., capable of at once resuming sea service. This means that if a Consul or Officer receives a medical report of fitness possibly qualified by a period of convalescence or need for weekly treatment, and even in the case of unqualified reports of fitness, he should withhold the information until, as indicated above, he himself is satisfied that the seaman is, in fact, fit and capable of resuming his calling. The necessity for imposing these discretionary powers on Consuls or Officers has arisen owing to the number of seamen who have arrived in this country as D.'B.S. some considerable time after a report of fitness has been made, but in a condition which leaves no doubt that they have remained continuously unfit for sea service from the date of commencement of illness, or injury. The effect has been that wages, etc., have been borne on public funds, when, in fact, they should have remained the Shipowners' liability. ( 33 ) In Circular 1751 of April, i943&gt; it was stated that, if a seaman is repatriated without a report having been made that he has become fit for service, he would be assumed to have been repatriated while unfit. In practice this has not operated as expected, Ship owners and Shipping Federation preferring a positive statement, and in reporting the repatriation of a seaman, it should, therefore, always be stated whether he is being repatriated fit - or unfit fo.r sea service. In the case of a seaman travelling on a Conveyance Order who is landed at an intermediate port, the reports of his arrival and subsequent departure should state whether fit or unfit on the same basis. (34) Consuls and Officers should reix&gt;rt through “ Sealot ” channels any instances of fit seamen in their charge who refuse offers of reasonable employment, including employment in a Pool outside the United Kingdom, and the dates and grounds of such refusals, A reference should be made in the cables to the immediate previous ' Sealot ” cable report on each case. (35) In the event of the death at a port of a seaman (subsequent to his discharge) from a British ship or of a British subject serving as a member of a crew of an Allied or foreign ship chartered or requisi tioned by H.M. Government or otherwise under the control of H.M. Government, the date and cause of death should be reported throug Sealot channels. This will supersede the cable referred to in para graph 336 of the Instructions to Consuls, 1930, and paragraph 227 of the Instructions to Officers in British Dominions, Colonies, etc., as amplified by Circular I7 2 3 M a Y&gt; I 94 °- (36) Sealot cables should, so far as possible, be kept to reasonable length, but it is desired to make it clear that it is better to cablemore information than is pritna facie absolutely necessary from appar ent facts, than to abbreviate to an extent which may involve delay and expenditure on further cables. As symbol punctuation is ignored by transmitting agencies words should always be used for that purpose, e.g., “ stop ”, “ Paragraph ”, “ Comma ”, “ Colon ”, etc. In lengthy messages without punctuation it is difficult, and sometimes impossible, to separate different items of information. ( 37 ) The practice has been adopted at some ports, of indicating on the return C.21 or CC.21 the fact that the information therein has been the subject of Sealot cables. These notifications save labour in the Office of the Registrar General and all officers are requested to endorse the returns ” Sealot sent ” in the top right hand corner where appropriate. (38) The use of air mail for transmission of information is to be deprecated and when used without a preliminary cable to report the movements of large numbers of men on passage to the U.K. the seamen usually arrive in this country before the report. It is recog nised, however, that in the clearance from a port of a large number of D.B.S. the report concerning them is of such proportions that the use of cables for transmission may not be justified. It is desired, however, that in such cases a short cable should be transmitted indi cating the number of seamen repatriated by the ship (named) and the date. The names of the previous ships of the men concerned should be included if possible, e.g., 12 ex “ Ocean Monarch ”, 14 ex “ Empire Glory and so on. This would enable preliminary advices to be circulated and enable Shipowners and the authorities to make proper arrangements for meeting the seamen on arrival. (39) Sealot channels of communication have now become a logical vehicle for the transmission of a wide variety of information of immediate importance to the Ministry, Shipowners, the Shipping Federation and others concerned in the movements and welfare of seamen following the termination abroad of their services. The infor mation now being received is, in its varied aspects, proving of such value that it is left to the discretion of Consuls and Officers to pass by means of Sealot cables such information respecting British and Allied seamen as they judge to be of immediate interest to authorities in this country. (40) It should be remembered, however, that Sealot channels of communication were designed to cover only seamen who may come into the charge of Consuls and other Officers abroad in circumstances which were not foreseen on the seamen's departure. For example, there is no need to include in Sealot cables confirmation that seamen on passage agreements, e.g., Eng. 19, etc., have transferred to the ship which they left this country to join. Changes in the constitution of the party travelling on a passage agreement during the passage to the intended ship or failures to join that ship must, however be reported. In reporting such changes it is requested that the name of the Shipowners or Managers appearing on the front page of the form Eng. 19 may be included in the report. (41) Manning Pools Abroad. —The entry to manning pools abroad of seamen in the charge of a Consul or other Officer, or of engagement in a ship of a seaman from those Pools, are the subject of a special series of cables from the Pool authorities to the Ministry, who inform Shipowners and take the necessary action to maintain payment of allotments. It should not, therefore, normally be the duty of a Consul, etc., to report the entry of a seaman into a Manning Pool. Sealot cables however, should be forwarded in respect of the despatch of men tor the purpose of entering a Manning Pool. (M.3800/44.) (46887) Wt. 38760—636 1500 12/45 D.L.

A copy of S.R. &amp; 0. 1943 No. 1124 amending Distressed Seamen Regulations VIII and XV is attached for the information and guidance of Consuls and Officers in the Dominions, Colonies and Protectorates* 2. The purpose of the amendment of Distressed Seamen Regulation VIIl is to authorise the supply of clothing of the quality usually worn by the seaman being relieved, instead of only clothing of such quality as is absolutely nccessary* 3. Cases have recently arisen in which survivors from shipwreck have landed at a port abroad where there is not a sufficient supply of clothing suitable for the voyage home. For example, tropical clothing may be available but not warm clothing such as the survivors will need on their voyage home. Some doubt has arisen whether a 'proper authority' at a port en route to a seamen’s proper return port was empowered in every.case to supply clothing or any other requirement which the original 'proper authority' may have been unable to provide. To make this point clear-2- Distressed Seamen Regulation XV has been amended to empower 'proper authorities' * at ports on*the voyage home to supply such needs, whether or not the conveying vessel is bound direct to the seaman's proper return port* 4. It is emphasised, however, that it is the desire of the Ministry that no risk should be run of survivors not being able, to obtain adequate suitable c ^ ‘iing on iirst landing abroad. If a Consul or other officer overseas has reason to think that there is a risk of this happening and if supplies of clotamg cannot be augmented locally fie should report the facts to the Ministry Uxarme B Division) so that steps may be taken to send a consignment of clothing tu oc held for issue to shipwrecked seamen. In forwarding such a report the Consul or other Officer overseas should state what is required and in what quant itie 3 . F.H. NORMAN -.,13052/42*STATUTORY RULES AND ORDERS 1943 No. 1124 MERCHANT SHIPPING Distressed Seamen The Distressed Seamen (Amendment) Regulations, 1943- Dated July 20, 1943 . The Minister of War Transport in exercise of the powers conferred upon the Board of Trade by Section 40 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1906 (6 Edw. 7 . c. 48 ), and now vested in him by virtue of the Minister of Shipping (Transfer of Functions) Order, 1939 (a), and the Ministers of the Crown (Minister of War Transport) Order, 1941 (b), and of all other powers enabling him in that behalf hereby makes the following Regulations: — l._ n(i) These Regulations may be cited as the Distressed Seamen (Amend ment) Regulations, 1943 , and shall come into operation on the twentieth day of July, 1943 . . ,, , (ii) The Interpretation Act, 1889 (52 &amp; 53 Viet. c. 63 ) shall apply to the interpretation of these Regulations as it applies to the interpretation of an Act of Parliament. 2. The Regulations relating to distressed seamen made by the Board of Trade and dated the 16 th day of April, 1921 (c), shall be amended as follows: — (i) For Regulation VIII (which provides for the supply of clothing, bedding and medical attention to distressed seamen) there shall be substituted the following Regulation: — “VIII. Distressed seamen may, if necessary, be supplied with clothing and bedding but in no greater quantity than is absolutely required.

The attention of Consuls and Officers in the Dominions, Colonies and Protectorates is therefore drawn to paragraph 114- of Instructions to Consuls (Merchant Chipping and Seamen), 1930, and paragraph 50 of Instructions to officers in British Dominions, Colonies and Possessions (Merchant Shipping and Seamen), 1927, and they are requested to impress on seamen who are engaged before them the desirability of making an allotment in favour oi their dependants. Consuls and other Officers overseas are also requested, when seamen engaged before them i.iakie an allotment, to draw the attention of the Master or the ship’s Agents to the necessity for sending particulars of the allotments to the owners by telegram in order to ensure that the allotment is put into payment without delay; if they are not satisfied that this has been or will be done they are desired to telegraph the information to owners themselves.

It has been observed that cash advances are frequently made by Consular and other Officers overseas to distressed seamen who are survivors from shipwreck, notwithstanding that their balances of wages have not been received by the Consul or other Officer. Provided that such advances are kept to the minimum necessary for the purpose of obtaining articles which might be regarded as necessities, it is intended that they shall be treated as “ relief,” no deduction being made from the amount of any wages subsequently deposited with the Ministry. It is realised that special cases may arise in which survivors from shipwreck may be detained in hospital for a prolonged period as a result of injury or exposure, when the Consular or other Officer may feel it desirable that some periodical advances should be made. In such cases instructions should be sought from the Accountant General, Grand Hotel, Black pool, by cable, and if advances are authorised the total amount advanced should be advised by cable immediately on the seaman leaving the port.

The Minister would be glad if you would bring to the notice of seamen, as opportunity occurs, the facilities open to them to purchase National Savings Certificates. Where a seaman is discharged or left behind abroad and his account of wages shows a deduction in respect of National Savings Certificates, such deduction may be passed provided the master can g.ive satisfactory proof that the seaman has arranged to purchase Certificates by means of periodical deductions from wages. The Master should be requested to deposit with the Consul or Officer abroad the amount of any such deduction, and the money so deposited should be shown in the current account to the Ministry of Shipping as 'Deposits made by Masters in respect of National Savings Certificates'. The names of the seamen on whose behalf such deposits arc made and to whom memoranda has been issued, as in the next paragraph, should be forwarued with the accounts. In the case of seamen who have been engaged on a sterling basis, the amount collected in sterling should be clearly indicated. Masters who deposit National Savings Contributions on behalf of seamen as above should be given a receipt on the usual official form. The seamen concerned should be given a memorandum in the form shown overleaf stating the date and amount in sterling paid to the Consul or other Officer on his behalf for National Savings Certificates, and should be instructed to present such memorandum to the Superintendent of a Mercantile Marine Office on arrival in the United Kingdom.
