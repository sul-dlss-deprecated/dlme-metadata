The proposal to repeat the telegrams in question from Bombay to the headquarters of the Government of India by ordinary post instead of by inland express would result in further delay of from 38-48 hours. In view, therefore, of the very considerable loss of time which would be involved by repeating such telegrams by ordinary post, and of the fact that the expenditure on such telegrams is not excessive (it amounted to Es.415/14 only in 1936-37) the Government of India are not in favour of the suggested alteration in the existing procedure for repdating telegrams from Bombay.In any further communication on this subject, please quote no.

With reference to India Office letter P,Z. 1987/58 of the 11th April, concerning the incidence of the cost of repeating to the Government of India certain telegrams passing between this department and His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to state for the information of the Marquess of Zetland that he accepts liability for a moiety of the expenditure which has been incurred by the Government of India in this connexion betv/een the years 1930 and 1937, and to suggest that this expenditure should be incorporated in the next annual statement of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Iran and elsewhere for adjustment v/ith the Imperial Government.

S.W.l. 19th March, 1938 Sir With reference to India Office letter P.Z»18/38 of the 25th February regarding diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to enquire whether it would not be sufficient for telegrams passing between the Foreign Office and His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran to be repeated from Bombay to the headquarters of the Government of India by ordinary post instead of inland express, and what would be the loss of time thereby involved. I am Sir Your obedient servant The Under-Secretary of State India OfficeThe alternative to the ^ Terai ,, and ”Jungle” arrangement appears to be repetition as a separate telegram all the way to Simla or Delhi. In that case the cost both of the original telegram from Tehran to the Foreign Office and also of the repeated telegram to the Government of India v/ould be shared with the Foreign Office. With regard to the Foreign Office telegram to Tehran,the cost would be shared, and so also presumably would be that of the The M Terai' and 'Jungle” arrangement might be regarded as affording a saving to India and to the and the Foreign Office. It seems to me, therefore, not unreasonable that the reduced cost of the special arrangement (i.e. the charge only for getting the telegram from Bombay to Delhi or Simla) should be shared with the Foreign Office. repeated telegram if sent by the Foreign Office to India. Foreign Office of a moiety of the cost as far as Bombay of sending separately, to the Government of India, copies of telegrams passing between Tehran&gt; 1' 'V •d' Uf. P.Z.3460/31 » « YV' 4 '*^ 0 2 . It will be remembered that prior to 1930, the Foreign Office had been charging India half the cost of their telegrams to Tehran, but had escaped a moiety of the cost of India's telegrams to posts in Persia. India did not commence to raise these latter charges against the Foreign Office until the 1st April 1930, and this presumably explains why they make their present claim in respect of the 'Terai' and 'Jungle” messages retrospective to that date. I would put the claim to the Foreign Office. i It seems to be generally agreed here that it can be defended as regards 'Jungle' telegrams, and it might be left, I think, to the Foreign Office to make a case for not accepting any liability in respect of the 'Terai' ones. The effect of Mf.Tait's proposal not to claim from the Foreign Office, after the 1st April 1937, a moiety of the cost of India Office telegrams sent to Tehran, would be to transfer that portion of the cost of such telegrams as has hitherto been born by the Foreign Office to the India Office vote. \f2 . %) f\ the cost of telegrams sent hy the F.O. or by this Office or the G.of I. is limited to messages to Iran . The cost of all messages from Iran is, however, included in the divisible expenditure and therefore if repeats from Iran were sent direct to the G.of I. the cost would be shared automatically. ft \ ^ V r-f ^ ro, 'U~-, ^ ,U&gt; ^- U ^ V ( V \\ f f\C\ The existing arrangement for the division of A/A P.O. telegram to Iran repeated to India 'by this Office would not be regarded as divisible - the claims hitherto preferred on the P.O. having been confined to telegrams actually sent to Iran. In this connection it will be realised that with effect from 1st April, 1937, the cost of telegrams sent from this Office is borne on the 1.0. vote and is therefore an Imperial liability. It is not proposed to claim a moiety of the cost of such telegrams sent after that 7 * date and it is even possible that the P.Q. may make a ^ . uM. ^ claim on Indian revenues on this account, although there ^ is a theoretical case that the cost of telegrams is covered by the contribution from India to the cost of the Office. -7 ^ 4// U Cut j&lt;-f. *-■ it Ctvr * 0)ruy 1*^ / 1 ^■■PHM &gt; 1 ■ ?&amp;: D.

It appears desirable, before presenting this claim, to obtain a decision on the question of charging the Foreign Office a moiety of the cost of telegrams sent from this Office to Bushire (see your reference to the Political Secretary of 30th September 1932, A. .G.10403/32). The cost of telegrams sent by the Government of India to Persia is charged for the first time in the iresent account, which seems to afford a suitable opportunity for commencing to charge for telegrams sent from this Office. 2. The Foreign Office might be asked for an explanation of the amount of £174.19.10 charged for non-effective services at Nakawn-Lampang. It is more than I2i% of the charge for salaries and * • i wages, and shows an increase over 1929-30, although salaries and wages show a decrease.An. early reply is requested as the claim on the Foreign Office must he made without delay. (3d) H.A.Janes. 23.2.33. Accountant General. I am still very doubtful as to whether it is worth taking up this question, in view of the risk of a counterclaim and the very snail amount apparently involved. On the other hand, even if we are confronted with a counterclaim, it is admittedly more logical that the 50:50 division should he applied generally, and, now that the Colonial Office have dropped out of the Gulf work, and that there can he no question that the Foreign Office alone are possibly concerned, the situation has to some extent changed, and I agree that, especially if the Government of India telegrams to Persia are, as the auditor states, being included in the account for the first time, a moiety of telegrams sent from this office to Bushire might similarly he included.

It is the practice of the F.O. to include half the cost of telegrams to Tehran in their claims on this Office. The use of the air mail presumably results in a certain economy in the despatch of telegrams. Before replying to the F.O. letter the S. of S. v^ould be glad to be informed whether the G. of I. include in their own claims charges for the carriage of air mails from India to posts in Persia^ and also whether they include charges for telegrams despatched by the G. of I. to such posts.

Previous charges for this service have been borne by the General Post Office but it has been agreed that claims in respect of charges incurred after March 31st last should be made on this department. 3. -a.s this expenditure would appear to come within the scope of the arrangement under which the India Office contributes one half of certain charges incurred by this department in connexion with Persia, the Secretary of State would be glad to learn whether Mr. Secretary Benn agrees that one-half of the above amount and one half of all future charges in this connexion may be on the India Office.
