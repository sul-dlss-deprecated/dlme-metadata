Dated the 25th April, 1938. Keference to previous correspondence DESCRIPTION OF ENCLOSURE. Name and Date. Subject. Translation of the important points in the the statement of the Sheikas lawyer) submi by Suleiman ash-Shawwaf, the lawyer of Abdu statement (in reply to tted to the court of Basra 11a ax-Zuhair.1 Translation of the important points in the statement (reply to the statement of the Shaikh»s Lawyers) put 'before the Court of Basra 'by Sulaiman ash-Shawwaf, the agent of AMulla az-Zuhair. Replies (to the statement of the Shaikh^ Lawyers), The defence of the defendants are framed in four points and they axe: - The duty of the Court, The passage of Civil Time, which they pretend. The passage of the Indian time, and The origin of the case. &amp; 1st the duty of the Court c In their defence, the defendants in t |iis personal case put 'before the Court the reason that Britain is protecting Kuwait, which they think that will extricate them from this lawful case. They say that Kuwait came under the British protection on 3rd November 1913, and tnat the agreement of protection also guarantees the properties of Rhai kh MuLarak as-Subah in Basra. They, in this way, try to put a new obstacle in this case, and also they avoided the service of the documents of the case for many years. This case is one of the several personal cases put up to prevent the intervention with an immovable property situated in Iraq.. This is a pure personal case between individuals, and there is nothing to justify the defendants in claiming it as a political or International one. If we carefully examine the guarantee, which the defendants state, has 'been given 'by the British G-uvernment, and find it valid and executive, thethe defendants could only claim whatever they lost from that Government. If they go carefully through the wording of that letter, they would find it incomplete as regards the undertaking to Shaikh Mubarak's non-payment of tax on his properties. To uphold to it (the guarantee) would mean to usurp the rights of others and their properties, which is unlawful from the point of view of the G-overnments• laws and rights. There is nothing in the laws of the world which gives the right to any Government giving any person the property of other (person). If an agreement concluded 'between the British Government and Shaikh Mubarak, this does not affect the residents of the Ottoman Country and their properties there. The Laws in the Ottoman country are not subjected to any opposition. As regards what the agent of the defendants allege that the Iraqi Government want to touch their rights (the defendants •), which is a strange thing and an attack (towards the Government), and this should not 'be put 'before the Justice. The British Government could interfere with the Kuwait affairs, within the 'borders of the Emirate, and the Shaikh has not to ask an Iraqi Court for the interference of the British Government in a private case 'before an Iraqi Justice. However if we submit and say there is an agreement concluded 'between Shaikh Mubarak and the British Government, according to an extract from letter dated 3/11/14 presented to me 'by the agents of the defendants, and if we go through it, we would find a word 'Jamat' (meadows), which means the* -3- 9 the meadows possessed, while the properties in question, are not Shaikh l!iibarak*s nor his heirs' at any time, and this (property) does not come under this letter, which only refers to what the Shaikh possessed. Besides the persons who intervened a-nd registered it in their names, and they are Hamad, Ahdulla, Jahir, Nasir and Salim, in a time when they were not Hulers or Emirs, 'but were ordinary persons i.e. during Shaikh Mubarak as-Suhah's reign. This property has not any connection with what Shaikh Mubarak as-Subati possessed or to have it possessed, because it was not left 'by him or he left it to his heirs, and he did not possess it at all. If the British guarantee is proper, which if recoursed to, the case does not come under it at all. The Anglo-Iraq, treaties have not any connection with this case, so they should not 'be 'brought 'before the Courts. The agent of the defendants says that among the defendants Ahmad al-Jahir, the Emir of Kuwait, and requests that the case to 'be taken up as a governments case. The status of Aiunad al-JaMr in this case is as one of the defendants in this ordinary and legal case. He, himself, has filed many suits and he still files against the individuals in Iraq, 'before the same Courts and through the same agent Abdul-Jalil Partu. Many judgements were passed agaj him, and among which one was under No.930/77, which was appealed and passed under No. 1932/66 in connection with a property in the Eaddaghiyah State, i.e. in the same state, which the defendants allege, included in the guarantee of Great Britain. The Court of Appeal, found it an ordinary case and not political, which was executed. All theio All tJtie defences of Shaikh Ahmad al-Ja'bir were refused Any how where was the British intervention which the agents of the defendants allege, and how can they claim it while it is not effective? They should quite understand that the Iraqti Justice is free and uninfluenced. Also we investigated the origin of the agreement 'between Britain and the Shaikh of Kuwait, and found it against international rights, 'because Shaikh MXibarak was an Ottoman subject, and not independent. In the same letter, which they quoted in their statement, and which they allege, was issued 'by the Wali of Basra, there was contained mention of Shaikh Mubarak as •Qalm-Maqam of Kuwait'. In accordance with the laws of governments, the conclusion of a treaty 'between an Ottoman subject foreign Oovernment was not admissible, aM if this agreement was concluded it would not affect the Ottoman Laws or the Ottoman rights, or after them * Iraqis, who came under those Laws. Passage of Time . The passage of time does not affect the case as long as the defendants in their statement acknowledge the ownership of Awwashah az-Zuhair. Awwashah az-Zuhair was and died in Istanbul 'before the pretended time of sale i.e. 21st Uuharram 1327 until the submission of this case, so it is clear that the absence is a reason for the passage of time. As regards what the agents of the defendants attribute in their defence to the passage of time according to the void Tapu documents in their hands, from wbich tney would not get any benefit, teoause'because these documents acknowledge the ownership of Awwashah az-Zuhair. They are not legal Tapu documents 'because they do not confirm the execution of the sale 'between the proprietor and the 'buyer in accordance with Article 11 of the Law of the Disposable Properties dated 28th Ilaja'b 1298. Passage of the Indian Time . 1 # The defence 'by passage of time must not 'be heard when the defendant is outside the occupied Iraq, country, see Article 13 of the Law for the passage of Indian Time. All the defendants have 'been in Kuwait outside Iraq, during the time. 2. Awwashah az-Zuhair was not allowed to put up a case in Iraa, and that was in accordance with Article 5 of the Law of the Occupied Iraq, country, which forbids any Ottoman not residing in the country, to put up a case, whether on her 'behalf or through agents Awwashah az-Zuhair was in Istanbul - the country of the enemy - the Ottomans, who were in war with Great Britain, so it was not in her power to put up a case in Basra for many reasons from the point of view of the Law, 'War and oppression. She was never allowed to have any connection with Basraby 'both the Turks and the British. As regards Article 14 of first volume, which the defendants try to fit in this case, it does not give them any 'benefit. (1) It concerns the thing that has not special passage of time, in the Indian passage of Time. (2) Article 14 refers to the Officer and his duties, 'but has not any connection with cases that are put up against others. (3) the registration of the claimed property could not 'be ascertained that it was executed Uy any kind of order, and also it is/&gt; -6- it is not known the extent (meaning) of that order, 17e do not sutait to it, while the property was registered in the names of Hamad, AMulla, and the ancestors of the other heirs. The registration in question does not say it was executed 'by the order of the Officer of HBvenues, and moreover it is not known who was this Officer of Revenues and whether was he appointed to this post permanently, (4) Article 14 also concerns the cancellation of the order or decision of a Government official in his duty, so it was not the duty of the Officer of Revenues to register others * properties in others* names. A'bove all the Tapu Departments are connected with the Justice and not with the Revenues. As regards what the agent of the defendants says that the Laws of the Occupied Iraq, country necessitate the grant of this authority, to which we object. All the Laws including the Tapu Laws, Disposition Laws, with the Tapu Instructions and the land Laws remained in force in the Occupied Country, and the Indian Laws which formed part of the Laws of the country does not show a single article which has connection with the Tapu Laws, 'but remained according to the Ottoman Laws. According to the International Laws the occupying Government have to follow the Ottoman Laws, and these laws do not authorize the Officer of Revenues to issue orders for the transfer of the property from one person to another, without the knowledge and presence of the proprietor and recording his acceptance 'before the official responsible i.e. the Principal of the Tapu. Even15 Even the Indian or British Laws do not authorize any officer, of whatever rank to give the property of one to another. If the issue of this order is correct (the order of the Officer of Revenues) it does not come under Article 14, 'because it is not the duty of the Officer of Revenues, to which this Article refers. Their replies (Shaikh^ Lawyers 1 ) on the origin of the case. It appears from their lengthy statement that they are trying to show that the registration of the immovaMe property in the Tapu Department was not necessary. I do not acknowledge any agreement (sale) outside the Tapu Department, 'because I am, in my capacity as Agent, ignorant of this, and I also do not acknowledge the agencies of Ahmed az-Zuhair and AMul-Wahah al-Kirtas. I point out that if I take it for granted and say that the sale took place, the argument given 'by the agents of the defendants does relate to any law. I 'believe it is not necessary for its postponement from execution, as long as the agent of the defendants consider my reason against the Laws of the country, and placing of the Rules under the Tapu Department and judgements of the Courts, which do not consider the sales that take place outside the Tapu Department. As regards the defendants* reference to the Notification of the Acting Commander-in-Chief of 5th July 1919. This date was after the date of the registration in question, and it only referred to Tapu transactions in the places where no Tapu Department were opened durinxr ^ the wqt , ^ven under-8- Even under those circuinstances preference was accorded for the transaction registered in the Tapu Department to those not registered, even of a previous date. As regards the Eule of Sale and Transfer of unregistered dated 18/4/1922. This relates to the registration of sale transactions which took place, when the Tapu Departments were closed, so it has no connection with this case, and this was a long time after the registration of the property in the names of the defendants and their ancestors. The defendants, in their statement, say that I did not comment on the invalidity of the documents which are with Hamud, AMulla, Nasir, Salim and JatxLr, which I now do. I say this relied on the acceptance of 'both parties 'before the Director of Tapu Department which did not talce place. The defendants allege that the sale was concluded with Kubarak as-Subah, while the registration in the names of Hamad and his coihleajues. For instance, if we say that the sale took place, its registration in the names other than Muharak' to It is not/be considered and it does not come under the legal acceptance. Everything produced 'by the agents of the defendants in respect of the lawfulness of the sale outside the Tapu is not legal. Firstly it is void. Secondly; it was not registered, l^ut another thing registered, which the defendants admit, and also it is not known what was that order which is pretended to 'be issued 'by the Officer of Revenues, and whether it was a support to the pretenied sale with ShaikhIf The agents of the defendants say that the British Government was in their power to issue orders and decide whatever they want, to which I o'bject, r do not 'believe the British Government accept that, because, according to the rights of governments, the Occupying Government have to enforce the local Laws during occupation, and when they want to put another Law, they could compile a new Law and enforce it, 'but this did not take place. Also the British Government did not put the Tapu transactions and the sale of immova'ble properties under the wishes of the Officer of Revenues, 'but left it in accordance wilii the Ottoman Law, for which Tapu Departments were opensd, and the latter passed the transactions according to the Ottoman Law, -9- With Shaikh Mubarak or other»Greenway, Kuwait.

I do, however, remember distinctly t ^t t a specia l order w s issued about the reopening of the Tapu Department, which had been closed, I think, from the beginning of the War until April 1915. If this order cannot be found in the files ol orders by the ^rmy Co mander, it is prcxctical .ly certain to have been published in the Basra Ti es, since I remember that I made special efforts to give the greatest possible publicity to the fact of tie reopening. It is possible tltt this order will be found to include a specification of the powers of the Revenue Commissioner in relation to Japu operations. It would of course be a general disaster to the inhabitants of Basra, were the Tapu ^owers of the Revenue Commissioner in 1915 and 1916 noWto he successfully challenge ed. since iminense arrears of applications for Tap^i ^ransiers had accumulated under the Turks and I worked them off pretty rapidly, enquiring into and signing some thousands of transfers. !Iany titles would be invalidated and there would be general discontent.

Digest. 1 * st.ut#© thiit it is not permitted for States or Kingdoms and their Rulers or is Presidents to be brought before the Courts as this/contrary to International Law and its principles, except in the following two specific cases5 firstly when the State or its Ruler raise a case to the Courts as plaintiffs, the defendant may then submit his demands, secondly when a person or other is indebted to the 3tate or Ruler and such monies or property are in the possession of a third partyo thevState or Ruler can bring up a case against the debtor and third partyo This law vvhich is applied to kings is also applied to Heads of Protectorates and Sovereign States (Part j j pages, 48 &amp; 6 ~ from Chapters 404 &amp; 406 of the aforesaid Volume)• It is of interest to state here a judgment given in the English Courts in this sense in a case resembling this one, when a king was summoned as a defendent in his personal capacity© Property in England, belonging to a foreign sovereign Prince in his public capacity, cannot be seized under process in a suit instituted against him in this country on a cause of action arising hereo Where a suit had been brought in the Lord fciayor's Court against the Queen of Spain upon bonds of the Spanish Government bearing interest payable in London and moneys, belonging to her as the sovereign of that country ? had been attached in the hands of garnishees in London to compel her appearance, the Court of QoBo granted a prohibition*, ^^^cu^h the action w^a nota in form* bro^ht y ^;aj.n§tr as Sovereign ; it appearing sufficiently by the proceedings that she was charged with liability in that character© The same' law prevails, a fortioni, where the action is avowedly grounded on acts don# by dext in tJ-e character of sovereign*As regards the Judgment cited by the plaintiff^ let it be supposed that it was really given, it should not be considered as reliable except on its own meritso Even if such a judgment were given by your honour yesterday^ it will not prevent you to reflect today and see that Justice is on our side^ M As Justice has always ^xisted^ it is better to adhere to it than to follow the paths of injusjtice' o 2o It is admitted by common sense and accepted as a Just measure, that certain actions taken by a Government do not come under the Jurisdiction of the Courts and these are called in the English Law as 'Acts of State' and in the Latin Law 'Actes de Souzer souvrainte'„ The responsibilities of a Government necessitate actions ? the importance of which cannot be weighed by a Judg«o He cannot • give Judgment as to whether such cases are proper or otherwise } or whether they come under his own Jurisdiction according to the ordinary laws in force 0 As, if Acts of State do come under the Jurisdiction of the Courts and are governed by the said laws, they would cause loss to the very object for which such Acts were sanctioned and probably stop their effect through being left to the descretion of Judges v/ho might follow a different policy and point of view of management of the important affairs of the State and would consequently give Judgment in compliance with restricted rules and laws which were specially decreed to regularize rights between private individuals* Among the principal 'Acts of State' are what the treaties of friendship and protection and transactions relating to the cession and appropriation of territorieso The transactions of indepeadent states with each other are governed by other v than those v/hich Municipal Courts administer, such Courts have neither the means of deciding what is right 9 nor the power of enforcing any decision which they may make * Hence, the Co\irts of this country, whether of law or equity^ have no Jurisdiction to adjudge upon acts committed by( 4 ) one sovereign state towards another in the exercise of its sovereign po er, such as the making and performance of treaties, the seisure of annexation of land or ^oods in right of conquest or the declara- -tion of war or of blockade or upon any rights or liabilities . supposed to be acquired in consequence of such actSo The same rule applies even where one party exercising sovereign powers; itself owes allegiance to a higher pov/er, in whose Courts the attercpt is made to control its Acts Halsbury the laws of England Vol. XXIII pages 3C*.-307« The English Courts had adjudged in a case against the iiast t * Indian Co M as representative of the Crcvn of Great Britain, that whether a contract was drawn up or not or whether the action affects one person or several persons ? it does not come under the powers of ordinary Courts&lt;&gt; And therefore, there are no grounds for private individuals to put a claim for same against the Viceroy of India as ' a representative of the said Co. The circumstances of the action for whi-ch this judgment was given may be summed up in the following The Eastern Indian Co. had annexed lands belonging to a certain Indian Rajah, who was still under age, and had fixed for him a regular allowance for life® The Co. designated itself as a tutor of the Rajah, just for a short period, and then finally took possession of his private properties® Then he died, his heirs brought an action against the Viceroy who was considered as having. ^ replaced the Eastern Indian Co. and claimed the arrears of the allowance and asked for a statement of account of the management of the Hajah's private properties.. The Court decided that the d action taken by the Co. comes under the 'Acts of State' and is not within the powers of the Courts 0 In a Court presided by Judge Fletcher Idolton in the action . of Salamon V, the Indian Secretary of State of India, the Court ' * * Adjudged that:- 'Acts of state are not all of one kind; their nature and consequences may differ in an infinite variety of ways and these differences may profoundly affect the position of municipal Courts( 6 ) * ^ * * with regard to themo For instence, an Act of St^te may fix the relations between two States each of which continues to possess an independent existenceo The consec|uences 01 such an Act 01 State are entirely beyond the congnisance 01 municipal Courts because they do not administer treaty obligations between independent States„ now These principles /quotedy should be respected in the our ^ of a Government responsible for these Acts of State as ©uch as t ley be followed In the case vlxere the 9Act of State' was issued by an independent State other than the one to which the court belongs. The English Courts have strictly followed this in n&amp;ny similar cases &lt;&gt; In a case in which the English Courts decided that it had no jurisdiction to' adjudge an action raised by British Subjects against the seizure of their properties in Iceland effected by certain Danish subjects, which seizure was later confirmed by the Danish Governmenty the Court decided that it had no power to deal in the action, although it was raised by Britishers against Danish subjects) on the grounds that the decision of the Danish Goverru r,nt in confirming the seizure was one of the 'Acts of State'«» (See the aforesaid volume, page 12 Chapters S &amp; 66 )0 There is no doubt that a Protectorate Treaty is one ot these 'Acts of State', whether it be considered in regard to Great Britain or in regard to HoH# the Prince of i^weit® On the other hand^ there is no doubt that the guarantee given by the British Government to the Prince in consequence of his appreciable assistance during the War, is admittedly an 'Act of State' and its said character cannot be contested or affected by having been drawn up in the form of an agreemento (See judgmexit delivered by Judge Fletcher Molton in the case previously mentioned of Salamon V the Secretary of State 01' India)* Had the. British Government put in force this guarantee, the Acting Commander -in-Chief would have ordered the registration of the properties in the name of HoH. the Prince. Such action on his part would be taken as an 'Act of State'o Therefore, the Courts have not the power to adjudge upon its correctness or not, orwhether It is in conformity with the laws or otherwise, because Acts of State cannot be'weighed except by the State necassitie.: and big aims which backed them up« The Courts should, theiefore, as Judge Fletcher Molton decided^ respect such Acts and consider them as established facts which eannot be overlookedo ■00 EXTRACT FtfOU THE SMGL1SH &amp; ElIPIHE DIGiiST (Vol. 38 ** pages 4 &amp; 5)» But the object and effect of an Act of State are not necessarily of thie kind.

The true view of an Act of State appears to me to be that it is a catastrophic change constituting a new departure. Municipal Law has nothing tb do with the Act of Change by which this departure is affectedo Its duty is simply to accept the new departure; and its power and its duty to adjudicate upon an enforce, rights of individuals or of the Govt^ in the future appear to me to be precisely the same whether the origin of such rights be an itct of State or not But although this be so it must not be supposed that the principles of interpretation applicable to an Act of State are the same as those which apply to other Acts, fpf W ^ tiS* H W'resegd, iP- a d&lt;?g.v^,yft.,. urponatfc- ta.gwfer frsnsfu? by uv mms i\wss^U:{ tvllwe that, ttofg i* to * cuafa'agt-.ttf 9r he. goret.rwe^ .by £ »8 wujia. b&lt;t ip Wt cevivsea jaw a, sgyt- Ui thy el.ai power may v;ell desire to reserve to sov.ers quite incansistant with contractual relations. As regards the plaintiff's pretentions that the Acting Commander-in-Chief had no authority to order the registration of the deeds of property in the name of EoHo the Prince, these pretentions are unfounded &amp; incorrect as this Officer m* commandiig the troops occupying this territory (Basra) © This power was given to him by the Protectorate Treaty in question^ which was drawn upII tf s betv /een his Government and HoH # The J ^ince oi Kweit. The Officer comiaiu in^ had to satisfy H»Eo at the time rnd prove to him that the British Government was interested in his affairs ^ and well The registration of the deeds in question and the Protectorate! Treaty, although two individual parts, aim at one and the same object and lead to the completion of one 'by the oth^r, and therefore d unreasoncbl' Lh ..vt in-Chief was not authorized by his Government to order the registra- -tion* ' Ife ^eover ^ t- must oe admitted that vdien a Government confirms its representative in a post of importance'- even ^vith limited pov /ers - any action he may take must be regarded as an 'Act of State',. Therefore, the iecisions taken by the British Government should be rrom the foregoing, it is sufficiently proved that the Acting Commander-in-Chief had the right in regard to the registration of the deeds of property of H«Ho The Prince, considering that this action comes under his power in his capacity as Acting Commander- in-Chief and is considered an 'Act of State' emanating at that time from an authorised channel, and must be respected a just decision, the discussion of which cannot be admitted or held as valid. 4. In view of the aforementioned statements, it is important to expose what is really meant by a guarantee or security* The Act of Security is a declaration from the guarantor to the guaranteed to take .on himself obligations to secure &amp; maintain the rights of the guaranteed or otherwise defray their value. A security therefore combines two steps} the first is that the guarantor is held to stand by the guaranteed and defend him until he obtains his very rights, and if he fails, he has. to rive him the value of the security, which is the second step# Disputes arising as a result of gua&gt;^.nteed rights would unfailingly lead the guarantor into such disputes and their I the case in point, HoHo Prince Moubarak encountered somedifficulties in rev-ard to the registration of his deeds during the TurJcis rule and later Great Britain guaranteed him his rights for the possession of these same properties. HJi. had no doubt whateve as to the importance of this in relation to the said properties and that it would be fUlly secured&lt;&gt; ■ concerns properties under dispute, the plaintiffs who brought this action against the Prince should certainly have brought it in the first place against the British Government, the Prince's guarantor, and such guarantee, as already explained, is an 'Act of State 1 * which does not 02. ^n any Court either in the Iraq or elsewhere. In spite or this, the question may be considered from another point of view. '^he British Government took this step at the time of the occupation of Iraq viiich was administered in accordance with statute of such occupation, i^ater on, and following Peace treaties, \ the country became under mandate. hen this mandate ceased to exist in accordance with treaties of friendship between Great Britain &amp; Iraq, the latter obtained its independence. Should not the Government of Iraq by these treaties ai d after having replaced the British Government and became independent, take over on its ovn responsibility all the engagements and obli-^ tiona of Great Britain in so far as concerns lands in Iraq? \&gt;e cannot admit or imagine that Great Britain had intended herself towards H.H. The Prince, especially when this guarantee cat-riot be c„ ilete 0: achieve i ts ends t.o t-.e benefit ^of th- Prlnc-a unless the Government of Iraq is bound.by its terms, having replaced the -British Government in its obligations towards the Prince. * These points have been given in order to enlighten the Court in regard to the numerous international difficulties, resulting from the present dispute which can never be solved by ordinary Courts.♦ jsf^ck on 'i-hh question of the gr-skt u'vpss op tjl £ The prosecutor replied on thi$ defence tii^t the Prince adr./i tx.ed the action and ti^ -t Uieir testatrix was absent, and also tfc .t this defence could not be heard against a(Khokani) legal Act- prttend ownership of these properties - the subject of tfris dispute. H.Bc. rhfc Prince atr-on^ly (Jeniecl this and snbialtted official documents to prove his own,ownership of ttese properties in support of hie defence and not in the form of a complaint. i l It is strange how it has been understood that koho The Prince's admittance is taken by them as a confession of their rights ir- e liti^'at on under dispute* Such a confession should imply ? conscieiiti ous avowal of the existence of the adversary's ri^ht v ith the intention of freeing him from the onus probandi and he who tells you ^hat you had a right and lost it admits nothing. because if he had given you something^ he has in the same time deprived you of it* We should not split this admittance taking into consideration one part and leaving the other . In our '~rst defence we gave sufficient proof with regard it has been proved that E,H. The Prince was in full possession of ' . ese proper tie 3 and of the proper documents whioh confirmed from l what date he was the rightful ownerc a have pointed out further that thede documents or others were not necessary in support of this. * It is sufficient that 16 years elapsed durii^g which period i . | for the judge to reject the case* c thsii t-stav^ix s this should not be taken into account, because the absence which prevents the unhearing of a cagTe is one of a definite nature when the whereabouts of the. absentee are unknown If such i and then it is not knovn whether he is det-d or alive ■absence is opened* But as a matter of fact, the hereabouts of the plain'oiffs* i* on r .c ab' e or applj-d to register her &lt; hi. mce Ingtlly.

After all what has been explained and in spite of the . incompetence,of the Court and the Case being prescribed» it should be rejected on the grounds that HoEo The Prince holds authentic deer '.s in complete form • deeds emanating from an authorised person holding a procuration thoroughly proved to be given by the proprietor* In accordance with the rules and laws all measures in general with regard to sales| donations^ properties in trust, marriage and divorse^ sanctioned by a procuration would have the power of right as if given by proper person concerned® El Kirtas Pasha within the pov /ers of a procuration he had in hand, sold to HoEo Prince Itobarak El Sabah these properties i: , the object of this action and by this sale they no longer exist in the name 'of the original proprietor since the date of its sale which v;as registered in 1915n Since it is admitted that this sale has separated these properties from the properties of the testatrix, there is no reason whatever to listen to the plaintiffs ? pretentions which should be rejected. It does not assist them in this action if they declared that the sale was in favour of one person and not in that of another of the sons of El Sheikh kobar^k El Sabbah § as the property has in any case come out of the ownership of the textatrix and her possessions, and consequently they have no further claim or right thereon whatever. .

The Pasha, who was profuse in expressions of regret at his 'inability^ to go personally to Koweit, said that he had been into the matter fully with his substitute, Rushdy Bey, on the latter T s return from Koweit. He thought Rushdy Bey had performed an excellent piece of work, and that his 'conclusionsas to the legal situation were admirably drawn up and should suffice in an unbiassed Court to win the cases for the Sheikh. Doss Pasha then said that he was pretty certain not only that the Armenian lawyers, whom the Sheikh has hitherto employed, were out to keep the litigation going (a fact which we had always realised in the Foreign Office, I think), but also that the Sheikh himself was anxious to lose the cases so that he might draw compensation in hard cash from - His Majesty's Government] In any case, the pasha said, there was no doubt that the Sheikh's cases had in the past been very badly prepared and handled in the Iraqi Courts, the present cases would have been lost but for the intervention of the Egypt ion lav/ye r. I understand that the present position is that the Court has adjourned the hearing so as to permit the claimants answer/ ,L. Baggallay, Esq., Foreign Office, S.W.1-answer Rushdy Bey's 'conclusions'. Doss Pasha is, of course, naturally out to magnify the role of his Egyptian colleague, but it is interesting that he should spontaneously volunteer the point about the Sheikh wishing to lose the cases. I do not remember that we ever suspected the Sheikh of going quite as far as that J Incidentally, Doss Pasha said that if the cases eventually came up on Appeal to the Iraqi Court of Cassation he would be very happy to handle personally the Sheikh's case. He did not, however, mention the fee he would ask for doing so. 1 Yours ever, (Signed) JACK WARD.CONFIDENTIAL. No. C - i 5 &gt;!•&lt; ?

There has recently been cutting down of trees on the Sheikh 1 s Fao Estates, without warning, by the order of Iraq •t Government officials. The history of the matter is as follows:- (a) The Mudir of Fao wrote to the -tiasra Agent of the Sheikh about cutting of trees on one specific part of the estate, the 'Bungalow', on 21st January, 1938. Copy of letter forwarded to 13' 2. 1 *- the-Hobble the Resident under my letter No.C-172|of 29th April,1958 (b) The Agent replied to it on 20th February, 1928 asking . . for particulars /of direction of the road, copy of letter was forwarded to the 4 ^0)- 1 h&gt; • :: f * i ~ Resident under my C-172 of 29th April, 1958. To this no answer was received. s. 6. mfp—1407 sap—{m-2339)—25-5-37—300,000.(c) On 25th April cutting of trees began at Bungalow and at two other distant parts of the estate known as ,,nsr and Qishla. (d) On the 26th April, 19^8 Sheiks lawyer wrote to the Port Directorate Basra a letter of protest, (e) On 28th April the Political Agent was informed about the cutting verbally by the Sheikh. He telegraphed information to the Political Resident, and personally to the Mutasarrif of -tiasra asking him to hold up cutting pending Oxxicial references, but apparently any counter order reached the Mudir too late to stop the completion of the cutting, (f) On 10th May, 1938 Sheikh wrote formally to the Political Agent asking for action to be ta^en oy His i-ajesty s Government to ^prevent such uncalled for action'', ana asking for experts to assess the damage done and tor payment compensation by the Iraq Government., Copy was sent to the Resident with this office lettei/ No.G-180 of 10th May, 19S8. According to the Sheikh the total of trees cut is:- (a) al Qishla 220 (b) al Qasr 1^° (c) al Bunalow —— Total 700 (See sketch accompanying letter No.R/5/926 of 2na June, 1958 from His Highness to the Political Agent, Kuwait , forwarded to the Resident under this office Printed letter No.C-201 of 8th June, 19 38, At al Qasr, it was reported verbally to the Political Agent by the Sheikh's Agent, there has been consider- able damage done, and about 1050 trees would probably die owing to removal of earth and embankments.

GIBSON The Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, SIMLA.r-t H&amp;O'kt/id j/Si&gt;• &gt; • /I 7 Sir, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to invite a reference ^ Ktf' ■- to Foreign Office letter E 1459/28/93 of the id2nd March l%lt enclosing a copy of a seni-official letter to this department from His Majesty's Charg^ d'Affaires at Bagdad regarding the properties in Iraq of the late Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah. The Marquess of Zetland will recall that in this letter Mr, Morgan enclosed the text \17 of a dr^ft note which had 'been prepared by the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs in reply to Mr» Bateman's note of the 8th July, 1936, that Mr. Morgan expressed the opinion that, with the exception of paragraph 5, which deals with the effect of the Sheikhs' non-Iraqi nationality on the registration of their properties, the draft seemed on the whole satisfactory, and that he was endeavouring to secure a redraft of paragraph 5 which would contain an assurance as to the miri as well as the mulk properties to which the Sheikhly families could be shown to have a valid claim. 2, From the enclosed copy of a despatch which has ^ now been received from His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad it will be seen that the efforts of His Majesty's Embassy to secure a redraft of this paragraph have unfortun: tely proved fruitless, but that Sir Maurice Peterson is inclined to/ r* /l# / Yf, ' 0 n r ©or try -f . t ' / Xa Ha Offioe* yrfD/SYf/y't*I 2^0 to think that on the whole the 'balance of argument is in favour of accepting the draft note as it stands, subject to the reservation 'by His Majesty's Government of the right, in the event of the non-Iraqi nationality of the heirs of the two Sheikhs 'becoming an impediment in the grant to them of title deeds in respect of miri land awarded them 'bv the Land Settlement Committee, to take the matter up with the Iraqi Government through the diplomatic channel. 3. The legal grounds on which the Iraqi Government justify their refusal to give the desired assurance regp rding miri lands are, as Sir Maurice Peterson says, very uncertain and confused. But Lord Halifax considers that no useful purpose would 'be served 'by pressing them further at this stage to reconsidej their decisiono Indeed, His Lordship fears that to do so, or to make enquiries of the Iraqi Government as to what course they would follow in the event of the land settlement authorities proving unable to grant title deeds for properties to which no one except the Sheikhly families could be shown to have any claim might only lead them to commit themselves more obstinately than hitherto to positions from which they would later find it difficult to withdraw. 4. It seems to His Lordship that the immediate 'objective of His Majesty's Government in this matter must - r ' j^uja-unji-ijam— be to arrange that the titles of the heirs of the two Sheikhs to the lands now in their possession may be examined, and if possible confirmed, at an early date. Once this has been achieved, and all other private claimants have been eliminated, it should prove possible to reach some agreement with/ nwith the Iraqi Government which would satisfactorily safeguard the interests of tMe Sheikhly families, either hy arranging that they may remain in possessoon of their properties, or alternatively 'by ensuring that, if they are obliged (failing a sale on satisfactory terms) to surrender possession of their miri lands to the State, they shall receive proper compensation from the Government. 5. Lord Halifax therefore proposes to instruct Sir Maurice Peterson to inform the Iraqi Government that His Majesty's Government are prepared to accept the terms of the draft reply to Mr. Bateman's note. He considers that the further communication to be addressed thereafter to the Iraqi Government should, subject to the further views of His Majesty's Ambassador, take the form of a formal note from the Ambassador to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (rather than a letter) and should indicate that if the non-Iraqi nationality of the heirs of the two Sheikhs should become the cause of impediment or delay in the grant to them of title deeds under the Land Settlement Law, His Majesty's Government must reserve the ri^ht to seek redress from the Iraqi Government through the diplomatic channel. A redraft on these lines of the communication in question is enclosed herein. 6. I am to enquire v/hether the Marquess of Zetland concur^ in the action proposed.

Usual ending. After complimentsN.L (l) Method of assessing losses . A. Property o unecl in ISl^ by 3 h e i k h M abara.: of K owe it The two headings on which it has been agreed that compensation can be paid are (a) Istihlak tax paid by merchants who exported from Iraq dates grown on the Sheikh's gardens, and (b) 1stihlak tax paid by the present Sheikh on produce exported to Howie it for his household consumption. 2. The figures supplied by Sheikh ,Uimad on these heads are as follows: 1932-33 1934 1935 1936 Total I. D. I. D. I.D. I.D. I. D. (a) 1872.7^6 588.585 747.618 1830.870 5039.819 (b) 180.138 89*948 58.910 6U. 58i!- 393.580 5U33.109 i.e. an average of nearly £1,100 a year. These figures were supported by particulars of individual transactions and the Embassy and the .. olitical Resident consider that they can be accepted as reliable. 3. It should be noted that these figures are for all the gardens belonging in 131U to Sheikh Mubarak. These gardens do not belong to the present Sheikh alone and are apparently in no case registered in his name. Two-thirds of the gardens belong to axl the heirs of Sheikh Mubarak, and the remaining third belongs to his male heirs only and their descendants./I 1 descendants. All the estates are, however, a dmi nistered by the ruling Sheikh on behalf of his co-heirs. The olitical Agent in Koweit has explained that their arrangement has been made with the consent of the heirs, but without any written authority from them. The estate is not a 'orivate waqf . h* It is a question for consideration whether the 191^- pledge can be taken to cover the whole estate or only the present S:ieiiCii 5 s part in it. The India Office consider that the pledge covers all the date gardens which belonged to Sheikh Mubarak in 191k until they pass out of the possession of his heirs by their voluntary act, and it woaid in practice seem difficult to take any other line in view of the decision reached regarding the heirs of Sheikh Khazal (cf. see below). 3. Properties owned in ISlU by J heikh Khazal of Mohammarah. 5. The headings under which it has been decided that compensation is due are (a) Istihlak duty on dates sold to merchants for consumption in Iraq; and (d) I^tihla ; duty paid on dates exported from Iraq. 6. The figures supplied by Sheikh Xhazal's agent are as follows: 1932 1933 193^ 1S35 Total (a) 531.435 1,229.000 1,167.202 1,092.029 4,015.866 (b) 6^7.836 557.U9U - - 1,005.530 5&gt;025.i.i.s6 i.e. an annual average loss of rather more than I.D. 1,250.7. These figures were not supported by details of the individual transactions, but in 133U the 3heikh f s agent informed the Embassy that he would obtain certificates if desired in respect of the dates sold in Iraq.. He also said that he could produce customs documents in respect of the dates shipped abroad. The Embassy reported, however? that it would in any case be impossible to verify these figures without an exhaustive examination of the books kept by the agent, as, although proof might be forthcoming that he had actually sold on behalf of the iheikh the quantities of dates mentioned in the claim, there would be no certainty that they were the produce of the exempted gardens or that they did not include the value of the produce purchased by the agent from the share of the date crop of the cultivators of the estates. In addition, they pointed out that the claim was in respect of a quantity considerably larger than that covered by the similar claim of the Sheikh of Koweit, although the exempted estates of the latter were assessed (they did not say when) by the revenue authorities of the Iraqi Government as having twice the bearing capacity of the former. 'i'he position therefore is that there is reason not to accept without verification the annual figures produced b Sheikh Khazal's agent? but that these figures have not been challen ,ed and that Kis Majesty's Government do not seem to be in a position to produce alternative figures of their own. 8. It seems difficult merely to fix the amount of compensation as half the fig-are accepted in the case of Sheikh Mubarak's gardens without further enquiry, since if this procedure were questioned by the heirs or others interested in their affairs it would appear somewhat high-handed. Moreover, the administration of Sheikh Khazal's estate/estate has no./ been talcen over by the 'Minors* Admini strati on' in Iraq. ? and it might cause resentment if figures supported by a semi-public institution of the kind were left out of account. 9. Two courses seem open: (a) to assess the compensation due on the value of the gardens as compared with those of Sheikh Mubarak's gardens. In that case the Embassy could be asked when the land assessments to which they referred in 1934 were made? and whether there are any more recent assessments. Or (b) to endeavour to check the actual loss incurred by the estate. There is working in Irac a firm of chartered accountants of high standing (Messrs. 'i/hinney Murray and Company) who might be able to undertake the tas,.: of checking the figures and documents produced by the former agent or by the 'Minor's administration'. If all that is desired is to get a reliable figure for the average annual loss (cf. below) it would not seem to matter which years were taken for review by the accountants, and, although some expense would be involved, it should be possible to reach an acceptable figure in this way. 10. It has already been decided that the heirs of Sheikh Khazal are to be treated no less favourably than he would himself have been if he were still alive, i.e. compensation is to be paid in respect of the whole gardens.(2) Method of calculating compensation. 11. Tr/o methods have 'been suggested - (a) that His Majesty's Government should repay the annual proved loss since 1932 plus a lump sum representing so many years 'purchase' of the current annual loss? or ^ (h) t-:at they should pay a single lump sum representing an increased number of years 'purchase'. 12. The course at ('b) seems preferable ? as less likely to involve bargaining and disputes. It would seem to have an additional advantage in vie 1 ;/ of the uncertainty as to the losses actually incurred in the past in the case of Sheikh Khazal's estates (cf. above). 13. The number of years purchase and the rate of interest to be allowed on outstanding capital have also to be fixed. k 111-. It has throughout been hoped and assumed that the fact that His Majesty's Government are prepared to pay compensation will have a beneficial effect on their relations y /ith the Sheikh of x owe it. Clearly, however, ihe effect will not be so great if the offer is not accepted: by him on the ground that it is too small, c.nd in fixing the compensation to be offered it may be advisable, not only to fix the minimum.figure, but to take account of the fact that a more ^ advantageous offer may have to be made if the minimum figure can be shown on reasonable grounds to be unacceptable. %(5) Method o f Pa yment . A. Sh e i kh Mub ar a 1:' s Bs t at e s . 15. V/hen the Foreign Office wrote to the Treasury in December last5 it was believed that all the estates were registered in the name of the present Sheikh and belonged to him^ and it was therefore assumed that any payment made would be to him alone. it was also proposed that he should sign a statement recognising the payment as full discharge in respect oi our liability. 16. It is a question how far this procedure v/ill have to be revised now. There appear to be two courses open to us (assuming that compensation is not confined to the present Sheikh's share in the estates, in which case the original procedure would undoubtedly apply):- (a) To find out the proportionate interest of each heir in the estates, make a separate payment to them all and obtain individual discharges, or (b) To pay the whole amount to the Sheikh and get a discharge from him alone. In this case certain verbal alterations would have to be made in the form of discharge. 17. The Foreign Office consider that, as our obligation to Sheikh iviubarak as a result of v/hich compensation was payable was an international obligation and not one of which any municipal court anywhere could take cognisance- ana as His Majesty's Government need not, politically speaking, concern themselves with the affairs of any of the heirs other than the ruling Sheikh, it does not matter who signs the discharge as long as it is signed by him. There would, therefore, seem to be no objection to adopting course (b), which is also much the more convenient, if, indeed, course (a) can be regarded as practicable at all. 13. If18. If this is done &gt; then the form of discharge mi^ht be amended to read as follows;- '1 in my own name and in the name ,T of all other persons inheriting property from tne ''late Sheikh Mubarak of ICoweit &gt; do hereby acknowledge 'the receipt of the sum of paid to me on 'behalf of His Majesty's Government in the United 'Kingdom, and 1 recognise this payment as a full 'discharge, binding equally on me, my heirs and 'successors, and on the other heirs of Sheikh Mubarak 'v/ith their heirs, of the liability of that Government, 'under the pledge given to Sheikh ilubarak in 1914, to 'compensate us for the loss we have suffered since 1932, 'or may suffer in the future, by reason of the Istihlak 'or any other tax hereafter levied on landed property 'or agricultural production in respect of lands which we 'hold in Iraq as heirs of Sheikh Mubarak, and in view of 'this payment made to me for myself and for the other 'heirs I guarantee His Tvla jesty' s Government against any 'liability towards the other heirs of Sheikh Mubarak in 'respect of such taxacion'. * h B. Sheikh ICha zal 's E states. 19. This case is unfortunately much more complicated. The distribution of compensation and the discharge, if any, to be given depends on whether or not we can regard compensation as an ex gra ti a payment. As in the case of the' pledge to Sheikh Mubarak, the obligation to Sheikh Khazal was not one of v/hich any municipal court anywhere could take cognisance, and the Foreign Office are inclined to the view that it probably lost any legal force it ever had when Sheikh/Sheikh Khazal ceased to be in any sense an independent ruler. If this view is correct ? any compensation paid by His Majesty's G-overnaent is legally an ex grat ia payment, and they can legally pay what they like and divide it exactly as they like. Further, since the heirs who will be receiving the benefit of the compensation have no recourse open to them except complaint either directly or indirectly to His Majesty's Government, it does not seem to be legally necessary to secure their agreement to the amount paid or to the arrangements made for distribution, and it might even be argued that it is not even absolutely essential to obtain ary sort of receipt or discharge from them. 20. It would, however, be very laborious for His Majesty's Government to endeavour to distribute the money fairly themselves. Unfortunately efforts made to induce the various heirs to agree to the establishment of a family waqf with the responsible head of which negotiations could have been conducted, have proved unavailing. Moreover the former agent of Sheikh Khazal, who had authority to negotiate on behalf of a majority of theteirs, has recently thrown up his position in despair at the behaviour of certain of the heirs, and the estate has now been taken over by the 'Minors' ;i Administration' . Assuming that any payment made is legally ex kr atias however, all that His Majesty's Government have to do would seem to be to notify the 'Ivlinors'Administration' that they are prepared to pay in £ 1. to the estate and ask them to submit an equitable scheme of distribution, sayin 0 nothing about any form of discharge other than a mere receipt. If the scheme of distribution were considered satisfactory, His Majesty's Government could then pay over the money, and that WOUld/i ; m - 10 - would be the end of the story. It v/ould not even, strictly speaking, be necessary for His Majesty's Government to be informed of the scheme of distribution, except as a means of enabling the:.: to satisfy themselves that the money v/ould be properly used. 21. It is of course conceivable that the 'Minors' •'Administration 11 would refuse to accept the money, even although no sort of condition was attached to its payment. In that rather unlikely event, His Majesty's Government would have to consider the matter again. 22. If, however, it is thought desirable to obtain some sort of assent from the heirs. His Majesty's Government ;;ill have to ascertain who they now are, and obtain from each of them, if they could not get the 'Minors' Administration' to do this for them, their assent to the proposition that the money should be distributed in the manner proposed, and further that they accepted the share to be allotted them as discharge of all their claims. Such assent might be forthcoming ii they were flatly told that unless they all signed no money would be forthcoming to any of them, but it is to be feared that in view not only of the number but of the financial position and character of the heirs it would be very difficult in practice to do this and would almost certainly taice a long time. 23. A further complication arises with regard to the actual distribution of the money if an attempt is made to carry this out on more legal lines. In that case His Majesty's Government would apparently have to make a distinction/iflttMBSMke&amp;i ' - I) J - 11 - * ' ^ i distinction between (a) the portion of the sum representing taxation from 1932 up to the date of the death of Sheiich iChazal and (b } the -rest. (a) would go to the person responsible for winding up the Sheikh's estate and he would have to include it in the assets in his hands for paying the creditors of Sheikh Khazal in the first place &gt; and in the second place for the distribution of the balance of assets among the heirs. (b)* on the other hand, should be regarded as not having accrued until after Sheikh Khazal's death and therefore as having really passed to his heirs with the lands which they inherited. It would accordingly not be liable to Sheikh Khazal's debcs, but the creditors of the individual heirs would no doubt take steps to get hold of it as soon as it reached their hands. A serious practical objection to this course is that 11 it were adopted it would be impossible to make a single lump sum payment in respect of the whole compensation (cf. above). V *. -- 12 - (4) Communic ation to b . made tjo, I ra qi. G^o yerr rnant. 24. It is admitted that it would be impossible to keep secret from the Iraqi Government any payment of compensation^ and in any case the Treasury consider it necessary to notify them of such payment officially, s^nce it is held that they are bound by the 1930 Treaty to implement the undertakings given to the Sheikhsj and that His Ilajesty's Government have the ri^ht to recover irom them any money paid to the extent oil losses actually suiiisrea, and it rni^ht prejudice that ri ^ht not to inform the Iraqi Government. 25. The relevant part of the 1936 note to the Iraqi Government is.- '6. As regards (b) (taxation)&gt; the 'proposals of His Majesty's Government are the 'following. They are prepared to make no further 'claim against the Iraqi Government ior the 'exemption of the properties of the tv/o Sheikhs 'from taxation in Iraq provided that the Iraqi 'Government will, for their pare, '(a) Give a formal undertaking, in v/riting, 'to make no claim for arrears ol taxation against 'either Sheikh in respect of 'Gheir properties in 'Iraq, and. '(b) Provide a formal written assurance 'that no discriminatory taxation v/ill be imposed 'upon the properties of either in future'. 26. Presumably, the communication to the Iraqi Government v/ill have to be somev/hat on the follov/ing lines, that His Majesty's Government feel it inequitable that compensation for the losses suffered in respect oi Istihlak tax/- 13 - tax on the two Sheikhs' properties should be longer witheld, and that they have therefore decided to pay compensation themselves on such and such a basis; that they reserve the right to reclaim from trie Iraqi Government the sums to be paid to the estates of the two Sheikns but that they will refrain from making such a claim if agreement on the whole question of the Sheikhs T properties, as regards both possession end.taxation, can be reached on the lines proposed in the 19^56 note, which otherwise remains unchanged. 27, The Embassy have recently reported that the Iraqi Government have prepared a draft reply to the 1936 note, which with one important exception (which the Iraqi Government are now considering anew) appears on the whole satisfactory. It is of course very desirable that His Majesty's Government should reach agreement with the Iraqi Government about the question as a whole, and a communication about compensation on the lines suggested above might prejudice the chances of a satisfactory reply ever being delivered, because the Iraqi Government may regard it as high-handed of His .iajesty's Government to pay, at a level fixed by themselves, compensation which they claim to be an obligation incumbent on the Iraqi Government, and because they may be advised that the action of His Majesty's Government in so doing weakens the claim of His Majesty's Government to recover sucn compensation from them, 28. The plan of SL.parating the 'taxation' from ahe 'possession^ issue was adopted because of the apparent IcaCk of/- 14 - of all reasonable prospoots that the Iraqi Government would accept the comprenjnsive proposals of 1936, without bringing in extr^neoas matters such as smuggling from Koweit, 'but in view of their, recent move, it would 'be well, while pushing forward with all necessary preliminary enquiries and arrangements, to give the ijubassy time to make a further effort to bring the Iraqi Government into line about the comprehensive proposals before any communication on the lines proposed above is maae to them.mmmmmmmmmmmmmKmrnrn , i ■*rl rz&gt;- X * 53/11 • 'Si Telegram From To Repeated Copy by post Q Secretary of State for India, London.

June 29tli, 1938 I visited the Shaikh's Fao Estates on June 19th, acoompanied by his son and agent, Shaikh Mohammad as-Sub ah. My obje -ct was to obtain if possible more light on the cutting of trees there this s-cring. to which I iv-ve referred in my letter lio .C-SOe of 8th June 1933, and first reported in mjr telegram No. 167 of 28th Aoril 1933. 2. On arrival I celled upon the Mudir of Fdo, one Haji Ahmad as-Sal im, and asked him if he could tell me from whom he received the authority to cut trees, as the Ilutasarrif had I knew not given him any instructions, and the Kaimakam of Abul Khasib had also said that he was ignorant of the matter. The Mudir said th£ t he had only received verbal authority from Mr. Coster of the Port. 3. J immediately went to see Mr. Coster of the Port who denied this, and said that on the contrary he had asked for authority from the Mudir, T. ; ho had categorically but only verbally, assured him that there was no miww ■ ■*** miiiwr^aww objection to the cutting, and that the Shaikh had agreed to it. He, Mr. Coster, had twelve years* experience at ^ao, and was always most careful to do what was correct. On receiving the Mudir t s assurance that he could proceed, he had given the Mudir Tt a free hand** with Lieut-Colonel Sir Tr en chard Fowle, K.C.I. 3., C.B.S., Political Resident in the Persian.Gulf, 3 U S H I R 3. ■Iwith the labour arrangements, only assuring himselT tt&amp;t the names on the labour roll were of those of actual men. 4. This arrangement was, he said, not satisfaotctry • ark was unduly prolonged and some of the men, were tenants, who were not actually working. He, therefore after a little time, changed trie systeia, took it out of the MUdir t s hands, and made it by contract. There was then a fomi of strike. No one wanted to work. He implied that he was sure that the Mudir was behind this strike. 5. lit . Coster, eventually, by threatening to bring in outside labour broke the strike. He described trie high handedness of the L'udir, who, as I saw for myself had two revolvers strapped to his waist, and Who, he told me, obtaining ammunition from sorrB of his Port officers, almost daily lets off rounds in the air, to encour ge working parties, emphasize his renarks, and so on. He thou^it that the Mudir was a little mad, and that association with the late General 3ekr Sidqi in the Hammar Lake operations had helped to turn his head. 6. However thfet may be it seems to me extraordinary that the Mudir should not have obtained written sanction from the Shaikh for the extensive cutting of trees, or if he felt he had the power to do so, issued a written order or instruction on the subject. With Mr. Coster I visited the places where trees had been cut, and I was also shown the water round many trees in spoil ditches made by the LIudir, which standing water will soon kill the trees, unless it is piped, away. Mr. Coster said he realized this, and wished to put in pipes but the Mudir forbade it. 7. In the case of the ^asr section he told Mr. Coster so the latter said, that work having finished at Bungalow and ^ishla, he would like to level off. 3 : I I a my -3- IT level off ^tlie Shaikh's road** to the ^asr. There was, as Mr. Coster understood it, no question of cutting trees, hut he did in fact out sons 180 from the right side of the road, where the trees belonged, not, as on the left side of the rc&amp;d, to the Ta'ab, hut to the Shaikh. 8. Haji Ahmad as-3alim, the Mudir, was employed at Eao and at Siba in the past, and my predecessor Colonel More had some years ago to tal$ active steps, and visit the Shaikh's estates, to counter his machination there, and he has, according to Coster, given it out that he has beaten the Shaikh once, and will do so again. This is I presume is a threat to obtain money, blackmail in fact, and the Shaikh^ son tells me that he felt it wise to give him £30, since the cutting, and has promised him Rs. 1,000/- periodically 9# As Coster was only on the 18th quite unnecessarily prevented by the Mudir from building some small works in connection with incinerators in the village, this n hush money tt seems to have started working successfully. 10» Coster himself also constantly referred to the Mudir as having now been shown as plotting to 'squeeze the lemon'. Coster being the lemoni 11. I refrain from adding more unpleasant details. A change of Mudir would appear advantageous, and Coster, whose letter of explanation, in reply to that of the Shaikh T s lawyer (a copy of which he showed me but which has not yet reached me) does not agree with his verbal explanation to me, should I think be warned to be more careful in future. With the memory of difficulties in which he involved us all in 1936 - see your telegram No.T /43, dated Kuwait, 26th April 1936, fresh inhis memory, and his twelve years* experience, he would I think have been wise to distrust the Mudir more tlBili he 1-4Z /I (/ 'i i CONFIDENTIAL .

He informs me that the position is soi.e^lt. t as . follov/s: - The plaintiff, having pleaded poverty, was unable to deposit with the Courts the amount of the Court fees and until such time as the Court fees are paid no judgment will be served. The laintiff has now reques -fed, in view of the fact that judgment was given in his favour, that the fees should be collected fiom the defendant, and lias requested the Execution Department to act accordingly# r T ow, the position is that until the fees are paid nothing can be done. 7r our friends may, if they like, pay the plaintiff T s fees and then judgment will be served against your friends. V 'ithin thirty days of the receipt of the judgment, the defenda nts must make their appeal. As regards what you call Tt summing up', your lawyer can obtain a copy of this with a co^y of the judgment (as will be issued when the fees have been paid) by sending a request to the correct department of the Law Courts. I gather that nothing will be done as regards the hearing of the appeal, should it be lodged, until the return fr cm sick leave of Coode, which should be, I suppose, in two or three months. ^jay other information you mey require I shell be pleased to try and obtai n for you. in G. 3. de Gaury, L'.C., Political Agent, kuwait® Yours sin cerely (Sgd) H.

Pertow, lawyer of H.H. the Ruler of Kuwait, Basra, to the Political Agent, Kuwait,I $o Translation of a letter dated 18tli June 1938, from AMul Jalll Pertow, lawyer of H«H. the Exiler of Kuwait, Basra, to the Politloal Agent, Kuwait&gt; After compliments, As directed 'by you, I have studied the substance of the case 'between the heirs of All Pasha Al-Zuhair and H.H # Shaikh Ahmed Al-Jahir Al-Subah, and I hereby submit the following particulars on the subject:- Al-Bashiyyah is a parcel of date gardens situated at Al-Faddagiyyah, in the district of Fao, It was formerly owned 'by Ali Pasha Al-Zuhair, according to Tapu Documents Nos. 27, 28, 29 and 30 of Aah 1915. On 21st Muharram 1327 Shafikah daughter of Hafidh Effendi, acting on 'behalf of herself ard. as guardian of her minor children Hasan, Bahljah, Najiyyah, Hamidah and Kami 1 ah children of Ali Pasha Al-Zuhair, had sold all her share and all the shares of the said minors in the said parcel of date gardens including the Muhawwilah in front of it, on Shat-el-Arah, to Shaikh Muharak Al-Subah as per deed, excuted out of the Tapu Department, on the said date. On the 14th of Bamdhan 1327 Abdul Wahab Al-Kirtas acting as guardian for Abdul Baqui Al-Zuhair, another son of Ali Pasha Al-Zuhair, had sold the said Abdul Baqui's share to H.H. Shaikh Mubarak Al-Subah as per deed, also executed out of the Tapu Department, and Shaikh Mubarak,and his heir-s after him, have taken full possession of the property and administered it upto 19 31 when one of the daughters, known as Hafi'ah 'bint Ali Pasha, had institued a case No. 77/931 at the Court of Instance, Basra, against H.H. Shaikh Ahmed Al-Jabir Al-Subah for restraining him from preventing her to take possession (of her share?) of the said property. H.H. the Shaikh was defended by the lawyer Sayid Muhammad Wasfi, the claim of the plaintiff was dismissed on the ground that a case should have been instituted against the legality of the deed of sale before instituing a case for restraining the defendent from preventing the taking of possession by the plaintiff. She appealed, against this decision, on 9. 11.19311931 2 1 and the Court ot Appeal held, in its decision No« 148/1931, that the deed on which the agent of the Shaikh relied needs no institution of a case against its legality as,(due to its 'being executed out of the Tapu Department) it is deemed non- existant. The papers of the suit were returned to the Court of Instance which re-examined it on 30.12.1931 and issued a Judgement, then, for restraining the Shaikh from preventing the said ^aii'ah from taking possession of oar abarae* in the said property. Service of the said Judgement was made on the lawyer Sayid Muhammad Wasfi on 18.2.32 and it was passed on to the Department of Executions and was served on the lawyer Iskander Mansur, who was appointed 'by AMul Aziz Al-Salim on 'behalf of the Shaikh with full authority, the lawyer Iskander Mansur filed an appeal against this decision which was confirmed on 9th May 1932 on the ground that sales effected out of the Tapu Department are not recognised ani that the second Judgement of the Court of instance is correct, and thus the Judgement 'became final. The Court of Instance,at Basra, wanted to serve the Judgement on me, and on my refusal to accept service the legal procedure, in the face of a refusal, was made against me. Then on 8.6.38 the lawyer Sayid Sulaiman Faidhi, on 'behalf of Kasim hin AMul Baqui Al-Zuhair, obtained an attachment against the share of the 2nd daughter, Bahijah hint Ali Pasha Al-Zuhair, for the date produce of this years date season of Al-Sashiyyah, the attachment was effected and a third person was appointed to take possession of the same. The shares of the other heirs will certainly he attached soon 'because of the events of this case. 2. To treat the matter after this, and according to the present Laws of Iraq., there remains no legal course for us to follow in order to avoid the cases of these inheritors, and vhoever, among them, wishes to institute a case against b can obtain a Judgment against us the same way as was done 'by their sister Bafi'ah. I also heleive that they can also demand from us the value of the date produce for a time not exoeedlng 15 years on the ground that the seller Hajiyah- 3 • /?&gt;• hajiyyah Shafikah lid not fully represent the minors as there was another guardian over them, he is Ahmed Pasha Al-Zuhair, add 'because the giving of the dates produce can 'be deemed as an action, 'by guardians, which is against the interests of the minors, therefore, it cannot 'be upheld against them, 3. The course which we should take in this case is that we should immediately contest the order of the Cheif Officer of Executions, 'by which the attachement was made against the share of Bahijah, and contend that we are the owners of the same and are in possession, and that the creditor of Bahijah has no right to attach#^the property in our hands, and that he has to refer the matter to the Courts 'by instituting a suit. Although there is little or no hope of success, yet this is one^the courses which are open to us, and which we must, primarily, follow while awaiting the result of the case of AMulla Al-Zuhair and the decision of the Court of Appeal on the Political points of the case® If the Court accepts our contentions on the Political points then we, on 'behalf of the heirs of Shaikh Mubarak, can contest the case of Hafi'ah from that point, and then we can hold on to this defence against all the other claimants* If the Court decides against us on the Political points then we would have no course left except to file a suit against the heirs of Shafikah 'bint Hafidh for recovery of the value which she had received from the late Shaikh Mubarak Al-Subah, and the attachment of her share and the shares of her heirs, the claimants in the present case, If we are ahle to prove that they have received anything from the estate of their mother, the said Shafikah.

(Designation)w that he could proceed, and had then given the aidir a free hand with the labour arrangements. What it amounts to is that no proper permission from any competant authority was received for the action taken, and it appears to me that Mr. Coster acted in an illegal manner. S 6 5. In the^circumstances the Shaikh would appear to have a clear case in the Iraqi Courts for wrongful damage against MT. Coster, either in his personal capacity or as a representative of the Port Trust. In view however, of the attempt that is being made to bring all cases connected with the Shaikh's estates under the Land Settle ment Scheme, the present is perhaps not an opportune moment for the Shaikh to file a suit in the Ira^i Courts. We i might however, treat this case on the same lines as that mentioned in telegram No. 108 dated the 13th July 1938, from His Majes^y^ Ambassador, Baghdad, to the Foreign Office i.e. to obtain eventually an undertaking that compensation will be paid.
