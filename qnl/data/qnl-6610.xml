The request is passed from the Iranian Consul-General to the Government of India, Department of Supply, who refer the matter to the Foreign Office out of concern for what they feel is an 'unusual' demand. The Foreign Office contact John Percival Gibson, Principal of the Political Department, India Office, to explain that the dynamite is needed for blasting purposes during the construction of the Trans-Iranian [Trans-Persian] Railway. The War Office also write to Gibson to suggest some British companies who may be able to supply the dynamite. Two further notes between the Secretary of State for India and the Government of India, External Affairs Department, support the supplying of the dynamite by British companies.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Department of Supply</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Dynamite</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>War Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India and Burma, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Railways</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x0002ba#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
