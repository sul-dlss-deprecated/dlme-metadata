I am writing to the Baraimi Shaikhs but if you could also do so I shall be much obliged. They could perhaps meet the party at the point at which the Beni Kaab Chiefs would desire to return home. I am also writing through Khan Bahadur Shaikh Isa to the Baraimi Chiefs in order that they may assist in escorting the party from Baraimi to Abu Dhabi.

It is not intended that these aeroplanes should descend between Sohar and Abu Dhabi but sometimes engines need attention and so it is necessary to come down and the officers wish to travel over the road to see it before they fly over it.

Keith will come to Muscat and, if you can, you might accompany him as far as Sohar so as to get into touch with the tribes people. The main question is the point of subsidies.

This estimate ' had to be on the liberal side owing to various uncertain factors. The length of time the trip would take was question -able.

I was informed by Mr. Thomas that Sheikh Salim was unwilling to part with the original fearing repriaala for disclosing it. His object in showing it wp^ probably to obtain a larger reward for his aerrioea. In riew of the letters from Ahmad bin mahomed bin Hilal and Sultan bin Saqur, and the non-arriral of Sheikh Mohomed bin Sultan, it appeared to me that further delay would be inadvisable as it would give time for opposi- -tion to be consolidated whilst if the tour were carried out expeditiously, the Sheikhs might not hare the moral character to oppose it individually and even if they did so it would enable us to disoover where the opposition lay* Sheikh Salim was willing to escort the party as far as ABEUAH and so I advised them to push on without awaiting the arrival of Sheikh Mohomed ibn Sultan. The party started on the evening of the 12th May accordingly. Their riding camels and saddles had been supplied from*Beit-wl-Falaj. In addtion to wireless and storm they took three tents- one supplied by Captain Thomas, one by Saiyid Hamad and one by me. I have the honour to be.

So I beg to state that when I received your information our camels were not ready but we have sent for them as soon as received your letter and whenever our camels reach we shall start at once from h«^re as we find no way to refuse your request and so you should have no doubt of our coming to you according to your instruction.MtfC- Copy of letter from Abmed bin laohomed bin Hilal. xteceired your letter which was the best Tisitor of us the contents are understood that the British Gorernraent 2 QCKX is willing to keep aeroplanes travelling in the air through the villages to India and Sheikh ttaqur might have informed us but nothing has been received from him on account of this matter.And if he would know the matter before he might have informed us but he did not even hear of this before.ABU DKABU way from here is a barren lend not # inhabited and there are foolish people of various kinds one may be from us and the other may be our enemy, and this is Oovernment. - We can not bear its responsibility without having an advice of bheikh aaqur who is supposed all to bear atidtx&amp;hls responsibility and who is able to defend us as well as our friends in the way until they reach him. The best advice I find is to delay the Wazir and his friends until the messenger reach bheikh baqur bin Zaid and come back soon with sheikh’s advice. TTe find no way to refuse what you are intending to but on account of this fact on other and thing which results to our spoil or yours is better to stop itbeforehand until our advice agrees to yours as the West people are yfanany choosing us and we are afraid may have avidity on us as they have no force. I myself prefer that the matter may be by the advice of the bheikh and if anything shall occur on us he will be responsible this is my advice, but I wish you also ask the advice of bheikhs Mahomed bin bultan and balim bin Diyain and show them my letter as the condition is well- -known to them.Copy of letter from Sultan bin Saqur to Salim bin Diyain* After Compliments etc. My brother Mohomed has just returned back and has informed me about your kind treatment sdaaut to him and so I am very grateful and thankful to you* I hope you may not do any mina to the Muslims ( Mohamedans ) but do what will please God and the Muslims* Frobably the Easara ( Christians ) will come to you and request to do them something which will bring a odd result to the people, youself and myself.

From this point the Trans-OMAB Bxi edition had Been arranged to start. Its object was to make a reconnaissance of the SAHAR-B1R/IUX-ASB DHABI terrain and to select landing grounds for the future air route. ’he proposed journey had been made only twice before by Europeans — neither with an ifianediate aate to grind and both occasions dating back more than v twenty years. f, he difficulties attaching to our plans for passing through these same independent tribes with the avowed object which the Arab believes to be subversive his vaunted inaccessibility and independence, were obvious. It was not surprising therefore that the omens at the out- -set for an Expedition according to prograrraae were not Thus propitious. (i) Before leaving Muscat letters had been received from Shaikh IBA BIH SALIH of interior Oman asking for information from SAIXTD M ARIK BIK FAISAL and S vlill) tfDHAJfilAD AL GHaSHAM concerning British aims in connection with the air route.

On the 14th we moved at dawn down into the WABI JIZ2I proper. a»»lng SAItAILAH the Shaikh's fort fired what was ostensibly the usual welcome byit the R.A.J. officers averred that the bullets came so close that the reception had no friendly meaning. I was not present at the time having gone back from Millaiyinah to explore an ancient feiej system, but coming on later caught up the party at RUBJ AS 3HUKRAXHX, an outpost of i£uscat territory. Here the harden of the fort, Ahaikh 3AI.IM BIN ABhbLhlH, a shady character, met us and warned us of a hostile Wadi Jiszi ahead, in token of which he pro- -duced a letter from fhoikii H Bill KBALFAK, of the SHtJWAMIS — l^haikh Randan forbade our progress without his concent. He Cicae in at AHAh however, cur i:e&gt;vt xxalting place, in response to our messenger. vt xhan too v/e despatched the WALI MUDHASTAR and two ahaikhs to BIHAlhl carrying yotir letter to the Ka'i® ShJiikh. In the afternoon we left for HAlh, the recently joined ahuwamis Shaikh and a dozen of his tribesmen accompanying us. Cn arriving at a tux*n in the narrow WADI ZlfltfASH this party, which was dismounted, ran forward a few yards ahead oi the column, loaded their rifles, and started a fracas. Thsir Shaikh, Kafikian , later r^asbureu us tliat it was purely an inter-tribal squabble but it may conceivably have been intended to weaken our resolution to go on. It held us up for a few minutes only and we reached Hail after dark. The'he following day, the 15th, we reeled at Hail waiting for our messenger to get through to Biraimi. ^hat evening the local Shaikhs received written instructions from the Ka’im Shaikh Muhammad to resist our progress. s our messengers with your letter had not readied Baraimi when the Baralmi messenger left there, this ominous sign did not affect cur plan of pushing forward in the morning. made an early start from Hail emerging from Wadi Jizzi RCt almost at once, and thei»e turning north through ttomx UBAlLAH reached HAJD, the pass on the Hajar Divide. Here we camped, our escort declining to escort us into the Naim habitat until we had heard from Biraimi. Our emissaries arrived from Biraiai within a few hours of a halt being mrj&amp;e with a reply signed by 3AQ,AR 3IH SUL?AH, Shaikh uhammad’s younger brother (Appendix J&gt;) It stated that our intrusion was unwanted, that rhaikh Muhammad was absent, that the country belonged to God, themselves and Ibn Baud and it denied knowledge of a previous promise ( see .Appendix C). Cur messengers had met with &amp; hostile reception, had in fact been pursued out of the town, and returned frightened and full of dire forebodings. The slave ABB BAUD A , so called Vali to the young Chiefs, but virtually himself ahaikh of the Na’im in Biraimi had moved out to picket the wells at JLHURU3 Bani Ka’ab, the forcibly to oppose our progress backbone of our escort, were visibly alarmed xX by the news of Ibn Baud's agent in Birairai and the reported submission of the ©HAHIRIYAH Baduins of the DHAHIHAH - an alarm heightened by the knowledge that their neighbours to the north - the BaNI QT aB - had also this year for the first time sent a present of seven camels to Ibn Baud. shaikh Salim, scarcely di&amp;f uising his attitude that in xjebkwsqqb accompanying us he had.’backed the wrong horse’, counselledStI trf our immediate return to Sahar. He gave uo to understand that the Ka’im were on the war path and we must get out of Najd at once. Gentries were posted by him on the hill tops while the c?imels were hurriedly saddled up. To avoid rx&amp;mdtx retiring and to play for time it was aost -desirable that the party should move north into Shaikh Balim’o territory but he refused on the score that it would conpromioe him still more. Although unfortunate for ue his attitude in the present tribal ferment was reaoonable. With information of all his Baduin neighbours ranged solidly with Tbn Baud ( which later turned out to be erron- -eous) he could not be expected to take a step which may alienate his own followers too: the conspicuous absence of HA 1 his brother, who wields an influence in the tribe scarcely less considerable han his own, also repres ented an unknown quantity. There was no course left us but to side step south-east into Bhuwamis territory and try and get into touch with bu Dhabi. But the Shuwaruis Shaikh Hamdan was equally reluctant to have us and we were obliged to camp in the open Wadi Hare ad one night before he agreed to our coming into his village at XX7MAR. Here came news that Abu Sanaa had moved down in our rear with a \ body of men to KAIL at the head of kadi Jizzi. he situation was an unhappy one. Not only was all progress barred but if we had to fall back only Wadi AhlB (Saham or Khabura) offered a way out. The continued absence of lia’adhid and Shaikh Salim’s continuous refusal to have the party set foot in his territory was susceptible of the inter* -pretation that the Bani Ka’ab had a foot in each Camp. X wireless telegraph message was sent to H.M.S. ’ALupin' 1 giving a resum^ of the situation at this stage. Stage ii. At Kitnah Thaikh Htoadan was despatched with your letter to the Bhaikh of Abu lhabi. Other messengers were sentsent to Shaikh Muhaiamad at Dhanic and to Ibn Hillol at Biraimi with an offer on lay part to come and interview them alone leaving the party at FJLtnafeu jbur or five days elapsed before the latter messengers returned: their answers were evasive or unsatisfactory (f ee Appendices il and F) . Meanwhile came better news from Biraimi. xevious accounts of tribal submission to Ibn 5aud had, it appeared, been exaggerated, the Agent - luhammad bin ilansur • was stated to have given no encouragement to the Biraimi opposition to us, and Pa’id, son of the British yent Isa bin Abdul Latif was reported to have arrived from Abu Dhabi with letters from Shaikh Baqar bin iiaid directing Dhuwahir to co-operate with us. I at once despatched another messenger to Ibn Killal in the belief that the juot Abu Dhabi gesture was an honest one. he Biraimi messenger returned with news that before his arrival Sa’id had return- -ed, unsmccessful, to ^bu Dhabi, but it was also rumoured that Ibn Saud’s /gent had left Biraiai hurriedly after a break with an AX B» f&gt;HAMX&amp; Shaikh. Ibn Hiilal in his reply repeated his powerlessnesa to help and then proceeded to show his hand and betray his master by adding that if the R.A.F. party remained at Kitnah for long the ha’im would come and attack us (Appendix G). Clearly the opposition was localised. DHtTWAHXB was acting in coll- -usion with HA*IM, a course they could only take with iBU DHABI*3 connivance. his clarifying of the situation was not without effect on our Bani Ka'ab escort who were further reassured by the rumours of a less successful sakat collection this year than on the previous occasion. ho useful purpose would have been served by our remaining at Kitnah, and Shaikh Salim was now faced with xhx having to support us outright or the contrary alternative.

On .he following day we proceeded via Qitah to tUM WAILA. nd here a move was made by Dibai either to divert us to Bibairos ftib&amp;i or hold us up in front of &gt;harjah. He had written the a letter - passed to me throuf^CcRiraander of H.M.S.

How /haiich Dahbah*s accession to our side joaoc In Arab eyes was of considerable importance.

Overnight Pibai’e brother HA3HIK escorting us had counsell- -ed our camping at KHUWAHZJ instead of UUM WAILA. KHUWaHIJ we discovered at the eleventh hour to be well off the Sharjah road and on the road to Dibai. Regarded together these moves seemed designed to hold us up in front of Sharjah for a day or two as we had been held up in front of Biraimi. To have complied would have resulted in dis- -crediting the fhrty in Arab eyes and lost us AWAM1B backing, We pushed on and entered Lharjah at 10 A.M. on 3rd June. Although the expedition did not,in a rigid sense. accomplish the entire itinerary mapped out for it, it almost certainly achieved a main objective namely the locating of ti the midway landing ground between Zahar and Abu Phabi at SIHAL HAKOPS {MAH DHAH). That HAKADHAH area has advant- -ages over Biraimi are obvious. (a&gt; It is in a more direct line between Sahar and Abu Phabi. (b) It lies in the territory of a friendly disposed tribe in Muscat pay as against Biraimi, which is usually divided against itself and further ao a bo-V t LS desert -^eat -in the centre of a varied oodc floating and irresponsible Baduin population answerable toI&amp;i) no authority. The chain of evented whicJi dashed Biraini from our hands and gave us M4HAX&gt;H2)H, though diahe^tening six to the party at the time, may conceivably be regarded by the Royal ktr Force .tuthoritiea as luck of the expedition. Vhe locating of this midway landing ground and the explor- -ation of all the terrain to the Eastward entitle Squadron Leader Keith and his two officers to the credit of having accomplished 70# of the work of opening up the Air Route in this area under desert conditions to which they were not accustomed and amidst considerable tribal unrest. It is questionable indeed whether they have not accomplished all there is to accomplish f on the ground* having regard to .vrab information which renders doubtful the existence of a potential landing ground (at any rate along the caravan road) amidst the roiling sand hills, in parts 100 feet high, midway through the sector to the west of Abu Dhabi. The unpopularity of the Air route is impersonal: it was not reflected by hostility to us personally. l venture to offer the following views which I S N I ^| have arrived at after numerous conversations with almost ^ every type of rab encountered on the Journey. 1 . £rom the outset there was a spirit abroad through Peninsular Oman antagonistic to the Air project. This arises from a belief that the Air koute will bring in its train a tightening up of British control which is regarded by Shaikhs as inimical to their self-interest. 2 . Cman proper being unaffected, and traditionally at loggerheads with the PKAHIRAH, the enquiries of IS v BIN SALIH and BAHUHX PASHA have no particular significance. 3. The source of the opposition is B in YAH. bu Dhabi and Dibai, in paying lip service and writing ostensib ly helpful letters, cloak and dissemble: in reality they are at the bottom of the , wire pulling*. hey wee in the Airn Air scheme the Hhin end of t,he weage’ and apprehend an extension of British interference and influence in rracial Oman* 4 . 4 . *.he Baduin tribes of the DHAHXRAU are suspitious lest co-opf.ration wiUi us may rouse Bin Baud, or rather BIH JAJiUWI» of whose raiding tribes they live in dread. b. The role assumed by the Biraimi Ha’ia is intell- -igible. Besides their fear of Bin Baud they may not Kfiand with impunity offend Trucial Coast Chiefs on whose ports they depend. 6 . Sharjah, through personal unpopularity wiih his own subjects and the neighbouring Ghaiiriyah tribes of Bani Qitab and Bani i a’ab, is willy nilly a puppet of Bibai’s witness Bibfd’s interference in Sharjah affairs (\ppandix I). In the Chra^ah letter to Sh&amp;ifch Salim (Appendix A) j^uggest it is not improbable that the hand is the hand of Isau but the voice, the voice of Jacob. 7. 7he opi&gt;csitlon of Abu I&gt;habi, J ibai, Ba’im, hhuwahir, Sharjah is explicable on grounds of a common identity of interests. B. liin Sand's agent's arrival, wivether accidenv&amp;l or designed, coinciding i*s it did with the expedition, provoked tribal unrest and played into opposition hands. But he was probably merely a tax-gatherer. tribes of Dhahirah when they pay fcakat, do so ouc of tear or expediency and not from inclination. 9. Abu Dhabi could at any time after Bin Baud's agent’s departure from the Dhahirah have secured our visit to Biraimi and thence to \bu Dhabi. This is the prevail- -ing view in Oman. It is shared by the British Agent at : harjah. If the Koyal Air Force Autharitiee, as it would appear probable, consider the landing ground as located at MLAfiADHAH now renders BI UImI unnecessary for their purposes, I would submit that for reasons of prestige, Biraimi I ID* m Biraimi should still be visited at the aarlicat possible moment you deem It practicable. Abu hhabi is unquestion ably able to arrange this at will. he rei/orted recent arrival in Baraimi of BHiUCBUT ana HaZA, two sons of his muroered brother BULTAB, cind presumably rival claimants to SARAH’S ehailc^itdoxa, may induce hi i to regard the moment as opportune for revising his recent methods and bringing his performance into line with hie promise. 10. Local unpopular!ty of even a peaceful invasion of their slue* ,an unsettled Baduin condition of life, and the perpetual menace of Vahabi encroacliment all make eninsular Oman a factor of considerable difficiuty in the schtvme of an Imperial Air Route. 7he reassuring f features of the situation are ( 1 ) the infcabitanis are backward ’political mindedneas 1 in a h&amp;tionalist sense does not exist. ( 2 ) the rival factions Hinawiyah and Ghafiriyah Hadr and Badu into which they are split up are at heart so much opposed one to the other Ahat combination between them for long is not a practical danger. ( 5 ) the settled elements e.g. Hraimi in spite of tfa^eir remoteness do not in reality enjoy immunity from our sea power because (a) their income is in *&gt;art derived from pearl fisheries (Biraimi is said to have 300 divers but this requires investigating) and (b) they are dependent upon the seaboard for food. As regards -he “aciuin exa element the truism that ’ftvery Badu has hie price’ will make pacification as easy as Bin Baud’s activities in these parts will allow. he question of subsidising the right people, if this arises, will require very delicate handling. 3ee art II Rote wf1 '% P ART H &gt; (c).

The country pasted through from Bah&amp;r to Burj ash Bhukhairi there can be little doubt was the ancient Maziui of the re-Islam days of ereian occupation. if Its capital JamsetJ^d has already been identified by and Mile* who after describing the ruined fortifications, its circular towers and cisterns with detailed accuracy, wrongly labels the hill where they are tojtoe found.

I 1 he water systems used in the wadi settlements though called falajs are not strictly speaking felejs in the true sense, that is they are nut tunnelled underground conduits as are the bhahinah and Shumailiyah systems. Here the running wadi water at a high level far up is carried xJbKXg in a surface conduit along the side of the wadi bank gradually gaining height over the wadi bed as the latter fulls more steeply. In time it is high enough up the bank for irrigation purposes by frclvination. ‘ he mode of life of the villager of the i^ugabil, the* Punud, H; dadna, Ru«-4ittiiiat and Ehuwamis is identical: and the villages throughout answer to thw same description.

In clearings or more generally above the date gardens are the rude hovels of the villagers, a mud built mosque, an occasional mud built bouse cf two rooms and a collection of single roomed palm- •'frond huts. Sometimes an upstairs room is added by the device of a palm frond ceiling. he floor is sunk a step, for coolness, below the outside level. tn an eminence is a small rude built stone fort, the residence of the Shaikh.

Sir Percy Cox, who travelled a year or two after Zwemer, follows Miles but hazarded the theory in his lecture last year before the Koyal Geographical Society, that the name may be used by local Arabs synonymously for J&amp;bal Rafit. In i&gt;oint of fact Uqda exists not as a mountain range but as a district - a thick acacia jungle in Sandstone Sih. The word ’Uqda’ meaning ’knot' may be suggested by the knotted branches of the acacia wmch here is the characteristic vegetation. he Uqda is div -ided into two ureas, one to the East of Hafit ana called Uqdat al Hafit, the other to the East of hiraimi sod )»o«l as Uqdat al Biruimi.

The prestige of Ibn Baud in PeninsuXa OMan is in direct proportion to his strength ana ability to harm it* There is no foundation for believing that some of the tribes being so-called V&amp;habis, they desire the extension to themselves of the Imam's full temx&gt;oral authority. The Hunbali sect to which the Dhahirah tribes in a large measure belong, is not, as practised here, essentially different from the aoliki or Shaft orthodoxy. thherited from a time when it took a narrow and fanatical form and imposed at the point of the sword, it is now »iittled down to a mwtaaaJaMUi moderateness ana toleration that make it unrecognisable as Wahabism. Go-called co-religionists of Ibn Baud, these tribue are inveterate smokers, though as a relic of past proscription, they do not as a rule grow 'the weed* in their own territory. Vhey would not gladly suffer the introduction of the rigid tenets of 'Riyadh. on the other hand Ibn Baud they cannot defy. Hopelessly divided against themselves into the binawiyah and Chafiriyah factions, unable or unwilling xo unite or sacrifice separate tribal sovereignty which is the genius of their system, it is only Ibn baud who in the past hundred years has been able to invade and dominate them under a single authority at biraimi. They know that it is only he who may desire and is able to do this again. But it is not invasion that they fear which prompts them to pay' 'zakat'. This spectacular method, which the first Invader, Abdul Aziz the Wahabi, used at the beginning of the nineteenth century is no longer necessary. Todey it is the power of letting doose a strong tribe to raid a weaker Dhahirah one and carry off its camels without hope of redress or retaliation tiiat is Ibn Gaud ’ s strength. Thus immediately before the arrival of Ibn Gaud’s zakat of the Bani Yas tribes was raided by the collector, oneA1 Murra and lost a hundred and fifty camels. . ayment of zakat to Ibn Saud is therefore a kind of insurance against the raider. It is the xxxk&amp;kk wisdom and economy of the present Abdul Aziz to bring his insidious pressure to bear on a wavering tribe through a strong and loyal heighbour whose interest it is to be ensured ^he fruits of victory. i.indful of the lessons of the ruth- -less if intermittent wahabi occupations of the nhahirah, the people of Peninsula Oman do not belittle the man of Riyadh who today has repeated the exploits of his fore- -runners, but they do not love him. In reality it is not Ibn Baud himself whom they desire to propitiate but his viceroy Ibn Jaluwi, Governor at Hcfuf, whose activities extend to these Eastern marches. Under this lighter r j| regime Ibn Baud’s influence does not as it did in 1800 penetrate into the Oman Bultanate or even to ;adi Jizzi, nor does it reach the Coast as it did at Aharjah in the 1 ighteen Sixties. Its design seems to be to bring the Baduin camel tribes of the Dhahirah - the 'inasir, Mi Early a', Ban! Yas baduin, Ba'im, Albu Shamis, Dhuwahir, Daru*, wamir, Bi ni i^a’tb and -i'^ni ^itab - to acknowledge a nominal degree of subordination and pay zaicat without trouble or expense ( or military measures calculated to rouse their antagonism Gle&amp;rly the tribes in close proximity to Has a e.g« inasir and izariya* axe un&lt; ole wO resist* those furtfier removed, the Brail &gt;as \who also derive strength from their coastal connections;, khe ha’im, Bhuwahir and Baru* are in a stronger position, while the Bani Pa’ab and Bani ^itab are suf ficiently rerau i.e to say , ho , . It is the wisdom of Ibn - aud to demand from the first, request from the second, and leave it to the vuiit- -ion of the third. 'he mazakki this year, one MuhaBamad bin Mansur of the Burra 1 tribe, collected zakat on the following basis OneCne dollar on each camel from ihe ’huw&amp;r' i.e. one year camel up^aras. One dollar on each ten head of sheep and ^oate. Poor caravanere were exempted and reraioolone were made to the moneyless Awaiair. he Paru* paid very little and the E ni Ka’ah and Pani tah not at all. But behind the zakat collections, the power of Ibn ftaud to turn one of these tribes within his influence on to another, its possibly hereditary enemy, and the fear felt within a tribe of its being left in isolation, give him an undeniable prestige. When these facts are realised the volte face of Shaikh Saqar after promising you support for the Royal Air Kxpedition ( Ibn Jaluwi is inwardly not on good terms with him) and the initial terror of hailch Balim of the B&amp;nl Ka’ab to harbour the Royal Air Force party will appear «o be acts of self- -preservation and give the observer pause before eondemn- -ing. ? hue the situation in Jau, or the Baduin northern half of the Dhahirah . he southern half of Phahirah starting at Bhank is called SIR. Its inhabitants are chiefly settled and mainly belong to the Ghafiriyah faction and the Ibadhi sect. Ibn Baud has made no overtures here and his agent would be unwelcome in any of its chief towns Ibri, Sulaif, 1 Araqi, inan or Bariz. It will be remembered that in December 192b the Imam of Interior Oman, and ; haikh Isa bin Balih invaded and overran Bahirat al Bir. UBtensibly their object was to resist Wahabi encroachments which were believed to threaten Oman 'roper itself. znoir move was seen however to involve worse implications, namely the subordination of Sir, predominantly Ghafiriyah, to a Hinawiyah hegemony, misunderstandings ai*ose and the army meltea away. SulaJLman bin Kamyar, Crhafiriyah, PHAHIRAT ) AL BIR. ) defected4 defected at the instigation of hie co^factionists on tiio the opposition side, and the Imam and Isa were obliged to abandon the ixpedition. JBiraiiai .aia Idiahirat at Jau generally, H&lt;*nabi in sect and Ghafiriyoh in politics, would never tolerate the extension of Kanawiyah and Ibadhi influence into .hahirat a€/ r;ir. In the event of a Wahabi invasion in strength I opine that Dhahirat al Gir would follow the lead of hhahirat al Jau, which must submit. Hut spasmodic aak&amp;t oollectiona alone, wiiich represents the present measure of Ibn liaud’s interferonoe in the Dhahirah, will not suffice to draw Dhahirat al Sir to his allegiance. ' acii small settlement prefers its independence, inclining in times of trouble to some f historical local alliance. Time Ibri has an historical linic wiuh the iyam t: tribe of ‘dulaim&amp;n bin K&amp;myar.

Importation of new rifles still goes on, probably only a trickle from atar, /I Hasa and Kuwait. Bibai is said to be &amp; local market for rifles that come from Kuwait stored under cargo in the bottom of the dhow. The land route from i^atar and 2 Hasa to Abu Dhabi is more conveniently used and new rifles fjrul uamunition may be bought in Biraimi or Ibri. But I saw few new rifles, the general run of the Badu's rifle being twenty years old, and they were shockingly dirty. r he most popular rifle is the short mauser ty^e with dropping block and cocking ha] handle. vhe bolt rifle usually gets choked with sand and its heaviness is a further disadvantage, though now and again the 1 nglish service pattern rifle ( invariably with the stock cut down to lighten it) was met with. the popular types are those for which good ammunition is plentifully available. The following axe comaoncst and given in order of public estimationHmunition is of two kinds •Wilaiyati* or that of European manufacture # and ’beddel* the empty cartridge which has been reloaded locally in the bazaar. It is interesting to observe how zealously an Arab afer firing »i3 will collect his cartridge cases, and nothing will usually induce him to part with them. : ew asmsmitlon for most rifles can be obtained at Debai or Abu Dhabi for 4 or D rounds to the rupee. In the Dhabi rah towns it is more expensive, 2 or 3. The locally made vra*iety coots a rupee for eight or nine rounds, the rab supplying his own cartridge cases. Every tribesman carries &amp; rifle; the Shaikh’s belt will generally be noticed to contain all Wilaiytti enrsiunition, the Badu in varying degrees will have a belt which exposes the leaden noses of Uie local rehash. Thw ♦beddel’ when used at night leaves a stream of light behind and gives away the firer’s position 'lie condition of the arming of the tribes is \ usually in direct proportion to their material condition :he order as far as I could gather is xaxfwHwx* thuseraonalltlcs * (e) '.he thief pereonali ties encountered along the Air Houte whose good will are essential to its security are as follows.

(b) Shaikh Salim bin Abdullah, the most influential man in lower /adi Jizzi, is Shaikh of the Uuqabil and Warden of the Muscat fort Burj al Thidchairi. He is already in the pay of the Muscat State but is really the nominee of Ka’im. He was proved some six months ago to have allowed raided loot and slaves to be smuggled past the Burj to Biraimi in return for bribes, was sant to muscat and imprisoned for two months. The Ba T im Ahaikhs inter- -ceded for hiia and he was reinstated on their standing security for his future behaviour. He wants watching. (c) Hamdan bin Khalfan, Shaikh of the Bhuwamis, of middle age, effeminate voice, but much local influence. He was after an initial hold up of great assistance to the ' ^editionISxpedition, gave us his village Kitnuh for a camp at risk of personal unpopularity and was my messenger to bu Dhabi. With Rush tidat and Hadi^dna subordinate to fca'im it is most necessary to have this man’s support in Upper Wadi Jizzi. He is cmxious to make his peace with Saiyid Hamad at Sahar, the latter having carried out his father’s death sentence on some slight pretext at Ha’im’s instigat- -ion a few years ago.

They are friendly to the liuscat State but do not get on with Saiyid Hamad. In 1925 they attacked and set fire to Shinas. The settlement I made then, which gives S'alim a Biaall monthly stipend, has resulted in closer relationship of the trioe with Muscat, and without their cooperation the recent expedition could not have taken place. The Bari Ka’ab oi ail the Peninsula Oman tribes has been uncompromisingly opposed to Ibn 3 aud: but they are afraid. he grandfather of the present Shaikhs was taken away in chains a prisoner of the Wahabis for eight years,during which time Mahadha fort was in Ibn Saud’s hands. f he battle of Sharra, which shatter* -ed the last Wahabi occupation of 1 Dhabi rah, was a uni Xa’ab victory.

'he British ^gent on the Trucial Go ^st and the Sultan's representative on the flahar side have a difficult role to play vis a vis the air route. It is onlj fair to remember that they are both /raba of good standing and cannot be expected to fly obtrusively in the face of public opinion30. half way landing ground at liahaclhah in Bani Ka’ab country^ I tentatively Bounded shaikh Saliia about the Boyal Air J^orce using this i)lace as a landing ground . He said he wan friendly disjotiecl but pointed out the difficulties. (i; the Ibn Saud question, and hie own fear that he will fall between two stools. (iij he could never agrree to foreign troops being quartered there, or to buildings, or any action which would discredit him in the eyes of the \rabs. (iii) he could never agree to Mahadhah being used in operations against Arab tribes. I pointed out that these views were based upon a misconception of the objects jmx we sought. As regards the first point, Shaikh Saliw’s of opinions deserve attention. His supporting the Royal Air Force party when other Phahirah tribes were rallying to Ibn flaud^ Agent is not likely to have endeared him to Ibn Hand: his opposition to Ibn Baud*a claims in the Dhah- -irah are well known : to allow Bani Ka’ab territory to be used by our aeroplanes is calculated to estrange Ibn Baud still further and result in his being raided by Dhohirah tribes acting unuer instructions. In such circum- -stances he must walk warily. If, he asks, as a result of satisfying our Air demands he exposes himself to these risks will we affoaMhim assistance or protection in certain eventualities ? Shaikh Salim before# he is able to UlfcT'V t agree to our proposals will therefore to know how he stands via ? vis Ibn Baud. If he is satisfied on this point he said he Is disposed to agree. Should the Trans-Oman lir Route be decided upon I suggest fc*®* the following monthly subsidies to tribal Shaikhs ** 100 Shaikh Salim bin Ply an (and Ka*adhi&lt;i} for rent of landing ground at Mahadhah and protection through- -out Ban!

Between 3 ahrdhah and bu Dhabi it may be advis* -able to subsidise - in conjunction with Shabi - one of the Ban! v ae Saduin oectiona 50 Is* per mensem for protection in caae of forced landings in that area. ever and above this an occasional douceur of Rs. 50 to the Aw amir and other Baduin who wander into this area would appear to be ?idvisable. he total cost of this would be about £s* 5,000 per annum. In the event of forced landings on preliminary air reconnaissances it may be of interest to pilots to know that they can identify Baduin from the distinguishing brands on their camels.

The letters are self erplan&amp;tory and urgent and^shall he grateful if you will forward them to the Political Resident. The new shaikh is prohahly not strong enough to override local feeling which you can Judge is not sympathetic .The Muscat State has neglected Khasah for some ten years and its authority there now is not what it was then.I have definitely not ventured to change that policy because (i) from a revenue point of view Khasah is a meatless hone ( we have no customs post there ) (ii) its remoteness makes it an expensive business to make frequent visits there and (iii) there has been no compelling reason to change the existing order of things .But it would seem that the State policy of self effacement rather than v assertion has encouraged the independent and obstructive attitude now shown to the Political Resident's surveyors. Khasah would seem to require a reminder onat unless it mends ways the State can put a strong post in the fort, collect zakat and establish a Customs post,hut the conciliatory policy is being followed to facilitate Politicat Resident's ultimate objects. I have the honour to be Sir etc. \ f\ 4 Finance Minister,Ufazir B.Thomas After compliments. I am honoured hy the arrival of your letter dated 26th Muharrum and whatever you have mentioned in it in respect of assistance to the surveyors,is duly understood. We have invariably been after your departure from us assisting them against any harm. We are not careless The Badawin have on hearing of the surveyors stay roused and insisted on their removal and we have been promising them (tribe) to get rid of them(surveyors). We have always been disturbed by their (tribal) troublei they are ignorant and do not know what is good and what is bad. The Political Besident has been addressed on the subject of execusing us from the matter and that he may please remove them.We hope you to execuse and to communicate with the President because we are incapable of protecting them and that wb are afraid lest a harm should fall on both sides. We expect from you forgiveness and equity in the matter. r Hassan bin Muhammad bin Sultan,Shaikh of Khasab.The Wali of Khasah to Wazir Thomas, states,inter alia 'The surveyors are carrying on in accordance with your 'orders* Shaikh Eassan is disobedient to the orders 'given to him by Government and is insisting on us to 'send them awayto you,and we defend them as best as we 'can.We have no power to defend them except politically* 'They are he insists to be sent away either to LTuscat or 'to Hinjam.

The house selected is at the hack of the Residency and is to lie rented at 110 rupees per month, it is also a site for a w/t Station. Before occupation the owner is to put the house into a food state of repair. Particulars of requirements were dis cussed with the mwkwx owner and Mr Thomas; in the meantime I have written to the Air Ministry asking for sanction. Two huoys to se laid at Muscat in line with the end of the coal pier and Tuner Gap at 190 yards internal; the sinkers to he supplied hy the agent 'Passaih*. i presume that the shaikh has no objection. 1 am writing to the Royal Indian Marine to obtain their permission for the storage of R.A.F. petrol and oil in their coal depot. ***** 3 . 1 think these are the nain .points and i shall be glad if you can look through the* and c&amp;eck anything that may be wrong, or otherwise confirm that this is the present position. unless we get a more on with these points it will considerably handicap the future cruises of flying boats down the Gulf. i «« pressing the Air Ministry to give a decision with regard to the Heat Houses as we cannot possibly continue liring on the hospitality of the political Agent and other Europeans whenever we have to land at these refuelling bases. 4. With regard to the flight to Aden new* uctober. it is most important that we settle on where we should refuel, fro* the map 1 suggest Mahut or Masirahi island, but 1 have little or no inforraation about them or whether the island i. eTen inhabited.

The third jlace in the neighbourhood of liukalla. 1 ilave forgotten where your jurisdiction ends on this coast, could you let ae know and whether you have any alternative suggestions for refuelling places, rearing in Mind they should not lie aore than 400 aileo apart. 6. question is how to get the petrol to these places, i presume, when we have located the most fa 1 , ourasle places, this could •€ done through Mespers but they will require time as getting petrol and oil there will be a lengthy process and they will not be able to aove during the monsoons.i I 2 . \ l -V a lengthy business as Bhaufar is 240 miles beyond Kishn. 4 , To sum up the situation. (a) You can rely on being able to refuel at ilukalla, but you must give us at least a fortnights notice,and preferably longer. (b) We are pushing on with our preparations at Kishn and in Dhaufar # and we shall have to let you know how we get on. 5 . ‘v &gt; If permanent moorings are necessary at these places I am afraid it will be impossible to get these made and laid down by October. On instructions from the Air Ministry we ordered our seaplane moorings for Aden locally through the rort Trust. They had to get materials from home,and the whole process has been dreadfully slow. Although they were ordered fire months ago they hare so far only produced one mooring in Aden and the other three wi£i not be available until the end of this month. 1 think, the ref ore, that unless the Air Ministry send out moorings from hime,it will be useless to expect the Port Trust to provide them in time.

' 1 enclose a letter from Thomas, the finance Minister. He wrote it after consulting H.H. and I have discussed the question personally with H.H. since receipt of Thomas’s letter. You are evidently tackling a tough proposition. The Sultan’s ~rit does not run eastward of Has Hasik and between here and Masireh is the ’~orst stretch of coast Hiere H.H. seems to think you '’ill not be able to land without getting shot up. H.H. considers your best course would be to cultivate friendly relations with the Sheikh of Masireh in the first instance. He thinks if you w ent there by flying boat once or twice, obtaining refuelling from a boat, then, after having estaolished a friendly footing with the .Sheikh and obtained his permission for a petrol store or landing grounjp on the island, you might in course of time be able to win over the wild tribes between Masireh and Dhofar. He thinks this ' f ill take three or four years at least. Zy Any too precipitate attempt to do so or even to broach the subject too quickly with the Sheikh of Masireh, might lead to the formation of opposition which hinder your purpose for a considerable period. Thomas has traversed the tract principally with the aid of the Sheikh of Masireh and no doubt H.H.’s advice is sound. Without the assistance of this Sheikh you would achieve little.little. Beyond Masireh, although the situation is somewhat unsettled at the moment, the difficulties are far less. H.H. is reluctant to ^ive letters in cases where-there is a likelihood of their bein^ flouted, but he is all out to help you as far as he can and has already issued instructions to the ^'ali at X)hofar mak ing any further letters to him unnecessary.

A* regards suitable harbours I Sur II (a) Masirah Island or (b) Mahut III (a) Khor Kuri or (b) Salalah or(c) Murbat Stage I Sur.Weather conditions are generally satisfactory in October, The safety of the crews could be guaranteed unless s a new situation arised^and petrol and oil could be sent by Mespers or local craft at any tine with a fortnight’s notice Stage II Mas ir ah Island ,.. The east coast would be exposed to the ^.E.Monsoon and unsuit able. The channel towards the mainland would be most satisfactory on weather grounds for the seaplanes,but it is full of shallow two fathoms patches at the north entrance,and is not anywhere buoyed so that a sloop may concievably be chary about navigating it,On the south west side of th* island,with approach from, the south, conditions wouldwould appear to most favourable. Alternatively (fc) Mahut (nor* correctly CJtotfbbat Hashish) is a better sheltered harbour and is navigable for a sloop.As lowlying islands Join up to the aainland at low water and the beach shelves inperceptibly,seaplanes would perhaps be well advised to land well out-Fishing craft are likely to be thick there in October: it is more populous than Masirah. At neither Ifimsirth nor Ghuhlat Hashish could safety of s«aplan« ersws hs guaranteed with csrtainity unless a sloop stood hy: t|ic inhabitant* have an unsavoury record* On other grounds both places would appear to &gt;• ftasable.but it would he unwise to fly low over land at either.The Shaikh of Masirah who is the shaikh of the Mainland too,divides his tine equally between Una Bases in Masirah Island,and Khaluf in Ghubbat Hashish (For Khaluf see ny B.G.S.map^)where I have stayed with him. In the event of either harbour being required as a permanent link in a South Arabian route,his active support would be necessa ry.But it will porhaps be considered problematical whether the present Air visit will aake it necessary to secure a previous arrange ment with him* This for 5 reasons. (I) a predisposition on the part of Badawin to object to intrusion except the fait accompli,ar as they have it in the vernacular will of God. (II) the inaccessibility of Tie si rah &gt;efore the end of the S.T. Monsoon would appear to allow insuff icient time to enter into conversation without some postponment of the Flight* (III) the presence of a Sloop would be sufiicient to ensure safety €(Sr seaplanes any how. As regards petrol and oil it would appeal'appear necessary th4t 'It 'be kept atoard the vessel taking it there,If this i£ a dhow the Flight could icarcely he arranged for early in October as October l»t is about the earliest a sailing craft can leave Muscat and it would be wise to allow a aargin of 8 days for the voyage. The alternative to dhow transport is to send oil and petrol around in our Muscat steals launch Al Safid.The presence of this,or son© other araed craft,would I suggest be necessary if a sloop were not available.The State would of course gladly enploy Al Sa'id for the purpose provided B.A.F. paid for coal and other expenses (say T ’s, 1500) Stage III This stage, the Dhufar Province,in the Central South presents fewer difficulties. The area is controlled; we have walls at Salalah and Murbit the safety of the crews could be guaranteed without the presence of a sloop;and oil and petrol could be landed beforehand and a dump safely arraged, Fron ny acquaintance with the ti.i&amp;s suggest,! landing places Khor Ruri,Salalah apd Murhat, Kurlat I consider Is test. Khor Ruri in January, Fetraury and March (you will reueater ny photographs of it) is narrOT: winding and unsuitable. In Octo’-sr (in which*, month I have not seen it) floods may have followed recent rains,hut I doubt their sufficiency and suggest that Khor Ruri be disregarded at any rate for the flight now contemplated. Salalah is not sheltered,but on an exposed beRph where there is generally a surf running Murtat enjoys the exclusive advantage of being in a protected bay,backed by distant hills and facing away froa the F.E.Monsoon, The choice of transporting petrol and oil there again reits between the State Gunboat4 Gunboat A1 Sa’id and dhow*If the latt*r a good 15 days should &gt;e allowed for the voyage; if the forner four days.

Hy leaving Muscat on 1st Octor'er, she should accomplish this work 'by 8th October thus making it possible for the flight to commence from Muscat on or soon after 8th October as may b@ desired. Should the k.A.f.consider th® expense of the latter scheme justified,it would appear to have the advantage of their having an assuraance of fuel at bfore leaving Macirah*and in the event of a nation I presume could be wirelessed to the seaplanes before they left Muscat.

V#=&gt;r y-A-fa.T- in tfr' - Very many thanks for your letters of April pJth a. / and Hay 14th,both of which I have shown to the Resident (Sir Stewart Symes, ) the Officer Commanding British Forces in Aden (Group-Captain Mitchell) and the Protectorate Secretary (Champion). I enclose copies of (1) a letter from Mitchell to Air Commodore Burnett (2) a letter from Champion to the Sultan of Socotra (3) a letter from Champion to the Sultan of Socotra’s representative at i^ishn. I have written to Barrett and have sent him copies of these letters. The general idea is that : (a) the reconnaissance party will take ship or dhow to Dhufar at middle or end of September with fuel and material for land ing ground. We rely on Political Resident Persian Gulf to advise Chief of Dhufar of the intention and arrange for assistance there. The flying boats on their arrival there should find their petrol dump ready and a landing ground prepared. (b) Dhufar having been completed the reconnaissance party will return by sea2 sea to vsfci shn with fuel (or dump fuel there on their way out) and will prepare a land ing ground (the Sultan 'being willing). Champion has taken all possible steps to notify the Sultan. The flying boats should not need to use the ^ishn fuel dump, but no doubt they could come down in ^ishn harbour if they wanted to: it is partially protected by a head land. (c) Mukalla is already prepared and has fuel (Shuhair)• I am going to England on three months* leave on July 4th,and am due back in Aden on October 6th. If you wish to write to Aden on this subject again will you do so either to the Resident or to Champion, who deals with all Protectorate and political matters? Yes,I like Aden still and am glad to be back he re, though I shall also be glad to get away from it for a few months this summer. I hope you are very fit. or G.p. Murphy, Political Agent and B MUSCAT.HEADqUARTlHS, British Forces in Aden. 8 th June 1©29. *: y' ■ l! Pear Burnett. Many thanks for your letter S.10451 dated 22nd Kay. The present position is as follows*- MUKAILA&lt;&gt;, Our most easterly landing ground at the moment is at Kukalla. We keep a supply of petrol there, and there is no difficulty about putting further supplies at Kukalla as a steamer goes there from Aden about once a fort night. There is no harbour at Kukalla,but it is an open roadstead and is quite suitable for seaplanes except in the monsoons. The monsoons end about the middle of September. I vls&amp;ted Mukalla last October and at that time a fairly heavy swell gets up about midday. It was quite calm upto midday. I went there in a warship and they ilew their seaplane at about 5.0 p.m. quite successfully,with the exception of a damaged float caused by the swell when getting off. This machine was a single seater Fairly and I do not think the swell would have affected a big machine like the flying boat. Therefore,there should be no difficulty at all about refuelling Muk$lla. shall want a few weeks notice of your requirements in petrol and oil,etc. and we can arrange to send some machines to Kukalla and will make all the necessary arrangements for boats etc. for refuelling. There are,of course,no permanent moorings,but 1 presume you can make arrangements to anchor the boats while refuelling. Kukalla is 340 miles from Aden, so you will be able to get from Kukalla to Men in one hop. 2. Beyond Mukalla the last place in the Aden Protectorate is kxfex Kishn,which isl75 miles east of Mukalla. We hope to get a landing ground there within the next two months. The difficulty is,that the Sultan of Kishn is also the Sultan of Sokotra and he lives at Sokotra. The Resident recently visited the Sultan at Sokotra and asked him about the possibility of making a landing ground in Kishn. The old man gave a non-commital answer,and in fact 1 do not think he quite understood what it meant. *.e are now trying to get in touch with him again about it,but it is a very lengthy process as no steamers run to Sokotra and the only communication is by dhow. However,we hope to get an oifleer down to Kukalla in August,and from there he will endeavour to get a. Irnding ground/Tn Kishn. He will also look for a suitable refuelling spot for flying boats. If we are successful in this Project I think we shall be able to get supplies ox petrol and oil to Kishn by sending it in a dhow from Kukalla. I hope to be able to give you more information about this place later on. 3, Beyond Kftdlhn we are outside the Aden Protectorate and the Resident wrote to the Political Agent,husoat,about the possibilities of getting landing grounds further east, xhe P.A. replied that there should be no difficulty in getting a landing ground in Dhaufar. The place Kurbat mentioned in your letter is situated in Dhaufar. he Resident is lilting again to Muscat,and I hope the P#A. Muscat,will be able to arrange this definitely and that we can send an officer down there. If we can get on with this we will investigate possibility of a seaplane refuelling station at Kurbat. xhe main difficulty,! think,as regards Dhaufar will be getting supplies of petrol and oil there,as no steamers aipe i o mn there. It may have to be done by chow which will be If r !;;; i If ! * .</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0002de_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/86</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0002de</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/86</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 2/10 1 II.

The required information was concerning the straight line Mirfah-Biraimi-Khaburah. Arrangements were made for some Royal Air Force (RAF) representatives to visit the region accompanied by a doctor, and Bertram Sidney Thomas, Financial Advisor to the Sultan of Muscat and Oman.The correspondence contains information on the estimates of the cost of the journey including hire of camels; cost of feeding men and camels; presents to be given to the Shaikhs; wages and foodstuffs, coffee etc.Letters were sent to various Shaikhs and Walis in Sohar, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Baraimi [Buraimi] and other regions, asking them to assist the Royal Air Officers while conducting their work.
