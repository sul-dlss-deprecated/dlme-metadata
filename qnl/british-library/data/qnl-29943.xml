Political Agency &amp; H.B.M's Consulate, Muscat, Recess Office, Karachi, the 3rd May 1931. From To The Political Agent and H.B.M*s Consul, Muscat. i The Secretary to the Hon ,- ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, t Bushire. Subject:» S U R. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter H0.87-S, dated the 28th February 1931. Suggested Conference at Sur. 2. Owing to the absence of Saiyid Said, the President of the Council of Ministers, on tour to the Batinah Coast, and to his illness from fever since his return, I was only able f to take up the matter with the Council at the beginning of April«Owing also to urgent preoccupations with the financial condition of the State I have only now found time to write the following report. 3. I informed the Council verbally of the Hobble the Political Residents opinion that they should get into touch with Ali bin Abdullah, the Amir of Jaalan and the paramount Shaikh of the Bani Bu Ali, and take the necessary steps to tighten up generally their control over the Sur Customs. I suggested that a suitable time for the conference with Shaikh Ali, and the Jenebah Shaikhs, at Sur would be when the Persian Gulf fleet concentrated there from the2 I ] Lv 18-20th of this month; the presence of the sloops would doubtless have a moral effect on the tribesmen* 4. They - i.e. Saiyid Said, {Shaikh Zubair normally agrees with whatever the former says, though he has plenty 0 f natural shrewdness of his own), said that until they had £3-%? a definite promise of assistance from His Majesty’s Government in the shape of a sloop to bombard if necessary, they would prefer no! to call the conference. They quite realised that the recent trend of events had increased the prestige of Muscat and they were grateful to the Political Resident for the interest and activity he had displayed in the affairs of the State. They did not think, however, that the Bani Bu Ali would givf up their claims to Aiqa - (which is the cause of the problem, since as long as their interference continues effective Customs control is impossible), without at least a show of force, and if this force was not behind them, and the Bani Bu Ali 'called their bluff”, the situation would be worse than before. 5. I did not of course give the Council my own opinion on their viev^s, merely informing them that 1 would convey these to the Political Resident, but personally I venture to think that they are right. Saiyid Said is by no means unenterprising^witness the ’deposition 1 of his uncle from Bohar, and if he thought that he could successfully without approach the Bani Bu Ali TSttX the promise of active assis tance from His Majesty’s Government, I am pretty sure he iLo would^ so. 6 . I then told the Council that I could of course hold out no promise of actual support by Government at Bur, but that supposing at some time in the future Government were so disposed what support would they want, and what would be their plans? They replied that they would like to hold aT conference • at Sur with the Jenebah and the Bani Bu Ali on or about 1st August i.e. about a fortnight before the first dhows were due to leave Sur, with a sloop anchored off Sur while the conference proceeded as a sign that they had Government behind them. They would then inform the Jenebah and the Bani Bu Mi elements in Aiqa that no dhows would be allowed to leave until they had agreed to pay in future Customs dues in full, and any dhow doing so would be prevented by the sloop. They would also inform the Bani Bu Ali that the latter's claim to Aiqa would be no longer allowed and tftat the flag-staff which still remains there, though it no longer flies a flag, should be removed, and if it was not removed, would be taken down forcibly. 7. They - the Council - did not anticipate any opposition from the Jenebah; on the contrary as the latter were now united, and on bad terms with the Bani Bu Aii, they looked for assistance from them, not did they anticipate much opposition from the Bani Bu Ali elements in Aiqa. 8 . The Council were of opinion that Bhaikh Ali and the Bani Bu Ali faced with a firm attitude by the state and backed by the actual presence of a sloop ready for action would most probably giwd no trouble. If, however, they refused to give/their claim to Aiqa, * nn&amp; brought down a contingent from Jaalan to attack Bur, or Balad as Sur, or both, the J©nabah would fight them off as they did in 1928 when though outnumbered - they drove off a contingent of the Bani Bu All who were attacking Balad. The Jenebah would also be helped by fire from the sloop. 9 , As the Jenebah would - according to Council - be in x r friendly, the possibility touched on paragraph 15 of my letter flo.Sl-C of 12th February, of retaliation on British subjects would not appear to be great*Comments. 10. The whole of the Bur problem was reviewed at some length in my letter quoted in the preceding paragraph. In paragraphs 13 and 14 of that letter I suggested a certain line of action, which is more or less that now proposed by the Council. In paragraphs 15 and 16 I pointed out that this action as far as the Jenebah and the Bani Bu Ali elements in Aiqa were concerned was likely to be effective, but that the Bani Bu Ali of Jaalan would not be effected since they did not own dhows, though it might be possible to bring pressure to bear on them by holding up their export of dates (paragraph 17). I emphasised the fact that my suggestion as to the holding up of this export was tentative and further investigation has shown that it would probably be too involved to be practical. 11. The Council, however, see paragraphs 5 and 6 above, are of opinion - briefly - that sufficient pressure can be brought to bear locally at Bur itself to bring the local elements under effective Customs control, and to eject Bani Bu Ali*s influence from the town. Further - if the latter bring down a contingent to attack Bur - the Council are of Opinion that the local elements can, and will, fight them off. The question of the stoppage of export of Bani Bu All’s dates can therefore be abandoned. Proposal. 12. I therefore recommend for the approval of the Hon’ble the Political Resident that assistance from His Majesty’s Government be asked for ag follows;- (a) Two sloops to be off Bur from about lst-15th August, with a possible extension to end of August. If two sloops could not be made available then one should be sufficient, but on such occasions the greater the display of forceth© less likelihood obviously there is of actual force having to be used. (b) Sloops to have authority to fire on dhows leaving Sur without permission. Doubtless, however, sloops could stop dhows without having to open fire. (c) Sloops to have authority to bombard forts held by elements hostile to the State, after the usual warning had been given, and to fire on tribesmen attacking forts or positions held by friendly elements. 13. As Acting Political Kesident I would propose to be present myself on one of the sloops and so would be in a position to judge personally of the necessity of opening fire or not from a political point of view. The Acting Political Agent, Muscat, would doubtless also be present. 14. I am aware that owing to unfavourable climatic conditions operations in the summer are naturally not regarded with favour by the imval authorities, in this instance, however, iChor Jerama - the ^anitorium of the Gulf 1 - is only 12 miles away, and the sloops could lie up there, while the ,? A1 Saidi” patrolled outside Sur itself, some method of signalling would doubtless be arranged between the ”A 1 S&amp;idi” and the slopps. 15. The necessity for action at Bur is summarized in paragraph 10 of my letter already quoted, while some of the arguments with which I venture to think the request from Government might be supported are touched on in paragraph 19. our is at present enjoying a period of quiet, but it undoubtedly contains seeds of strife and disorder (vide ior instance paragraph 3 of my letter already quoted), and all its past history would seem to show (paragraphs 7 and 7 A of the same letter) that unless further action is taken it vsill relapse into its former disturbed and semi-rebellious state.I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, i• c • Major, Political Agent and H.is.M'® Consul, muscat\ ^rzr V- X Ho. 2/^ ,f 1931 * Political Agency &amp; H.B.M 1 ® Consulate, Recess Office, Karachi, 15th May 1931. Muscat, To The Secretary to the Hon^le the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Memorandum. With reference t© my letter Ho.l2/K of 3rd May 1931 paragraph 4. ~V~ When reading through the Sur File I have come across a passage in a letter from Major Murphy Uo.40-C ©f 18th March 1929 (paragraph 2) in which the Sultan expressed pretty much the same opinion as the Council do now. The passage for ready reference reads as follows:- 'His Highness considers that if he went to Sur and ordered the Bani Bu Ali to remove their flag and Customs post and cease from interfering in Sur affairs and then was not in a position to enforce these demands, he would merely be giving an exhibition of his own weakness. He is therefore reluctant to undertake any such discussion unless the British Government were ready to support him by placing a sloop at his disposal with authority to bombard Aiqa should he request them to do so.' Major, Political Agent and H.B.M's Consul, Muscat,'kU Confidential* / /• d- 2 ^^ D.O.No.253-3 of 1931. British Residency, Bushire, the 11th May 1931. 6 /uv . Please refer to your letter Ro* 12 /K! of the 3rd May 1931, regarding Soar. Firstly, I must frankly tell you that there is not the smallest chance of the Government of India or His Majesty’s Government agreeing to send sloops to Sur with authority to bombard. The days when such authority was lightly granted are, I am afraid, very definitely past and it is only possible to obtain permission of this kind in the event of a definite revolt or of danger to life and property or in support of the suppression of the slave trade. As you know it took us one month to get permis sion to take action at Khassab, and it was then only given after considerable discussions and because there had been a definite revolt against the authority of the Muscat State and the life of their Wali was in danger. At Ras-al-Khaimah I was authorised to seize dhows but al though the Shaikh’s attitude was threatening and the Residency Agent had been compelled to seek refuge on board a warship and a complete deadlock had arisen in the negotiations, the Government of India refused authority for a ship to knock down an outlying fort. I got authority to issue an ultimatum to Shargah about three months ago j because interference had taken place with slaves attempting : T.C.W.Fowle,C.B.E., iicai Agent,Muscat, at Karachi.dollars • • • • - 2 - to obtain their freedom, and in such cases of course His Majesty’s Government are always willing to authorise strong measures, but 1 can assure you that there is not the smallest chance of their doing so at Sur under present conditions. What grounds are there for asking sanction for such drastic measures? I went there in August last and the Bani Bu Ali climbed down to a certain extent. Saiyid Said went there in September and, as you yourself say, paid a successful visit, a salute being fired in his honour and the Muscat flag hoisted. It cannot be said therefore that the Bani Bu Ali have adopted in any way a hostile attitude: on the contrary they have adopted a conciliatory attitude. We were both ourselves agreed that the next step is to try and get in touch with the Shaikh of the Bani Bu Ali but Saiyid Said’s only idea seems to be to meet him under the guns of two threatening warships. This does not seem to me to be the way to bring about a peaceful settle ment, and at any rate strong measures cannot be adopted until more peaceful measures have failed. I therefore suggest that the Muscat authorities should first of all invite the Shaikh ^of the Bani Bu Ali to come to Muscat and talk over things in a friendly way,or if he will not come himself to send a representative. As far as I am aware no effort has yet been made to get in touch with him on these lines. I think incidentally you might hint to Saiyid Said that his attitude is inconsistent. With one hand he is trying to cut down the Levy Corps and at the same time he is appealing to His Majesty’s Government to send ships to support the authority of the State. The fact that Alban was able to go to Sur in 1923 with 3 machine guns and 150 levies, compose blood feuds, recover 6400dollars customs dues from the Ban! Bu Ali and a fine of 4000 dollars from the Jennebeh shows what the State are capable of doing with their own forces, and provided they maintain an adequate levy force* Frankly, however, I have never quite understood what the difficulty was about maintain ing more stringent customs control at Sur. The large majority of the Sur dhows belong to the Jennebeh and only a small number to the Bani Bu Ali. These dhows come into the ; Sur creek and once in there are under the control of the ! Muscat authorities. If the askaris about whom we have heard a good deal lately are incapable of dealing with the situation j could they not be stiffened, if necessary, with a detachment from the levies? These dhows are hauled up on the beach for overhaul during the monsoon and there seems to be no particular difficulty in preventing them being put into the water if necessary, if they are suspected of not having paid customs dues, etc. In any case it seems to me that you have got the dhows before they are ever put out to sea and there is no necessity of waiting till they have been taken out of the creek before stopping them. If any dhows fraudulently land goods at Aiqa they are bound to come into the Sur creek sooner or later and could then be seized. You say there are 12 dhows belonging to the Bani Bu Ali; I was told that the number of large dhows in their possession was less. However this may be, the smuggling into Aiqa in Aiqa dhows is probably not on a very large scale and I should have thought that it would be possible to devise some method of getting hold of these dhows too. It seems quite probable that they are-4- ^7 'war'mentality. Tell Saiyid Said to try a little diplomacy first and to try and effect some working arrangement with the Shaikh of the Bani Bu Ali. The Muscat state should now be able to control the Jennebeh and ought to be able to arrive at some method by which the Bani Bu Ali elements in Aiqa can be brought more or less under control. Anyhow we must give up the idea of sloops and bombardments, etc., except under the very gravest and most definite provocation and the sooner the Muscat state realise that and learn to lean a little more on their own Levy Corps the better.y4r tith reference to Colonel Biscoe’s confidential D.Q,$o.253-S of 11 th May. I saw Saiyid Said before leaving Karachi, and told him that, sloops would not be available, and that we a-' '' / would have to carry on without them, he was quite prepared to do this, and when I asked him what his plans were with regard to Sur, after some reflection, he replied as follows! He would pay a visit to Sur and go into the question of any deiaulters from the Jennebeh tribe who were not paying full customs dues; he would make an example of some of these by putting them in prison for a short time. This he thought would have a good effect as far as the Jennebeh were concerned. /ith regard to the Bani Bu Ali, he would go slow and see his way. On his arrival at Sur, Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah and other Chiefs of the Bani Bu Ali would doubtless come and talk to him. This seems a reasonable proposition and we must wait and see what happens. In talking the matter over with Colonel Biscoe, the latter informed me that Captain Alban suggested making a surmner camp for part of the Levy at Sur, where the climate is better than at Muscat. Prima facie this seems a good idea and Captain Alban can go into the question when he reaches Muscat. The presence of the Levy would, of course, strengthen Saiyid Said’s hands.Telegram (GTC) ?rom Political, Muscat To Resident, Sushire Mo.149-G Dated 3rd July 1931.

Captain, Political Agent &amp; H.B.M’s Consulf'Hs \ Translation ©f a letter dated 24th Rahi al Thani llso ( 8 th September 1931) from Saiyid Said bin Taimur, President ©f the Council ©f Ministers, Muscat State, to Captain R.G. Alban, I.A*, Political Agent and Consul, Muscat. After Compliments. With regard t© my visit t© Sur, I take the opportunity of writing t© inform you ©f the state ©f affairs which I found and the reforms I introduced there. As y@u are aware I visited Sur twice in H.M.S. Ships this I could d© only through y@ur help and I thank you. The kind assistance ©f our friend the Government towards the State of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman has always been shown in the past and we are thankful t© them. My first journey fr©m Muscat was in the beginning ©f July last and the second at the end of the same month. On my first visit to Sur I found every thing in order and the subjects loyal to the Government ©f the State ©f Muscat and Oman. During my stay I established a Custom House at tt Hillat al Qarmitain* at the Eastern side, near the Kh©r (creek) into which boats enter. 1 also notified the people regarding registration of their boats and other reforms, the introduct ion ©f which would strengthen the finances of the State and enforce its authority. To all this I encountered no ©pp©siti©n whatever from the subjects and after accomplishing all the above I returned to Muscat and I thank God f©r the success. Before leaving Sur I promised the people that I would return to them after some days in order to see what progress has been made and t© introduce further reforms. After my return t© Muscat from Sur I received a letter from the Bani Bu Ali Shaikh - Ali bin Abdullah Al Hamu&amp;ah - requesting my visit in connection with some matters which are not hidden from the Government (please refer to2 correspondence from His Highness the Sultan and the Council of His Ministers on the subject of the opposition ©f the said Shaikh who is one of the Sultan^ subjects and who claims things which neither his grand fathers nor he himself had enjoyed 'before, etc.)* I sent him a reply to the effect that I proposed to visit Sur in a short while and that 1 wished him to come to Sur then. I left Muscat the second time (as already mentioned) and on my arrival at Sur this time I found the new Custom House progressing as desired and all in order. I ordered their boats to be numbered and this was accordingly done. I also appointed a new Shaikh over the Janabeh tribes. Two days after my arrival, the Shaikh of Bani bu Ali, All bin Abdullah, arrived at Sur and called on me. He discussed with me all matters which he had already discussed with the Sultan and the Hobble the Political Resident. As you are aware the village of Aiqa which is a part ©f Sur and in which are living some of Bani Bu Ali is not taxed with any sort of Customs Fees by the Muscat State at present - unlike the past - since four years ago, and this is of course for reasons which previous correspondence will explain to you. If you refer to H.H. the Bultan^ letter dated 25th Rajab 1348 (27th December 1929) you will come to know about the transgressions of the Shaikh of Bani Bu Ali. With regard to the flagstaff which was formerly installed by the®, it has been removed and this was really done after the Resident had notified the Shaikh of the Bani Bu Ali to removes it. What remains for the Sultan 1 ® Government to d© now is to levy taxes ©n Aiqa and introduce other reforms. The Shaikh @f the Bani Bu Ali in the course of his conversation with me claimed an allowance of 0 500 per mensem, that a Custom House be established at Aiqa and that3 | j taxes should be levied ©n people other than the inhabitants of the said village. He also claimed some other things from the Sultan-Gevernment which he had no right to do as he had never been allowed previously. His claims, however, I did not approve and as I did not agree with him he achieved no result from his visit and his conversation on these subjects. I however did not levy any Customs tax on Aiqa pending communication with and explanation to you regarding this Shaikh and his illegal action. Communications have already been made in this connection, but I now draw the attention of the Hon’ble the Resident and our friend the Government to the fact ©f this important matter, which if so left, and if the Government pay no attention to helping the State, we should then expect as its outcome nothing but rebellion and encouragement of other subjects of the Sultan’s Government. I further add for your information that Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah wanted to interfere in the matter of the new Custom House and also in other affairs but he was given no chance so he withdrew at once. I now request your views and that your consultation with the Hon’ble the Resident in this important matter. As you are aware the Government ©f the Sultan ©f Muscat and Oman is doing all possible nowadays in order t© strengthen its financial position, similarly its authority and we have genuine hope in the Hon’ble the Government. As stated above the work in the new Custom House which has recently been established is being carried out and the state ©f Sur is satisfactory except the claims of Bani Bu Ali about which you are aware. In conclusion while renewing our friendly relations I also offer my thanks to the Hon’ble the Government.Muscat 22nd September 1951« Dear Captain Alban, Reference our conversation of yesterday. The following were my proposals for ensuring a more effective Customs control at Sur, 1. Sikaikra fort shoul be taken over by the Customs and a guard should be placed there, 2. A strong Customs and military guard should be placed at Khoor-Jiram. 3. Al Saidi is also to be placed at Khoor jiram to patrol the coast between Sur and rChoor Jiram, 4. Boats are to be inspected thoroughly well and goods that are not mentioned in the manifest snouid be confiscated and 'the Captain of the boat should be imprisoned and fined, 5. A Customs house should be built at the entrance of Sur .Khoor where the customs hut is situated at present, 6 . Cargo should be landed ex at Batih (where the new Customs house is to be bui It). 7. A Customs guard should be placed at Aija* 8 . All goods shipped to foreign ports from Sur should be covered by manifest. During the last two visits of Saiyid Said, in whose company I was, the following proposals' have been carried out hy his orders;- (1) A Customs guard has been placed at Sikaikra, (2) A suitable place has been selected for building a fort at hhoor Jiram as soon as the Customs house is built. (3) Al Saidi will be placed at Khoor Jiram when the con struction of fort will commence, (4) Boats are being inspected by the local Director of Sur as soon as they anchor in the harbour. (5) Customs house is being built at the entrance of Sur Khoor. ( 6 ) Cargo will be landed at Batih as soon as the new Customs house is completed, (7) This proposal is pending settAemfcnt with Bani-bu-Ali.

Tiie proposed arrangements as detailed under (l) and (2) of the Presidents letter seem t® me t® be perfectly suitable t© the occasion and are the outcome of isany discussions betweenSaiyid Said and myself. Tiae proposal contained in #ara (2) where Saiyid Said jsrojoses to write t© Ali bin Abdulla notifying him ©f the ifxautx fait accompli aad informing him of his own exemption was my suggestion and was calculated t@ make Sheikh Ali feel that his importance was not sufficient to warrant his being consulted again after the rather insolent attitude he appears t® have taken up on the occasion ®f Saiyid Said’s last visit to Sur. {jcnATCAf^vl am new rather inclined t© think that it will be better to send for nim and make him sign a deeuMent on behalf ©f himself and kis fallowing agreeing to fay easterns dues with@ut demu/fc. 6 .

Saiyid Said mentioned t© me privately that if he could not obtain a promise of H.M.Government*g active sup port, xji case ©f unforeseen emergency, he vtfould be compelled t© order the Wall ©f Sur^o repair and strengthen the f©rts guarding Aiqa and Urn Q.&amp;rmit&amp;in, bring up extra bodies ®f Asxaris from Muscat and generally make preparations f©r a war.

I need hardly say that Saiyid Saiu in asking for fv H.it. Government* s support is only actuated by motives ®f prud ence, he has t® think of the future, his succession in his father’s place depends up®n H.M.Government’s &amp;ppr©val and he, as he told me himself, c&amp;nnet afford t© run the risk ©f in curring any charge of h©t-headedness ®r rashness.3 9 The success already gained at Sur should be lowed Uf with the minimum of delay 10 , It is n*t, 1 think, necessary te go into details as t@ what feria of support would be necessary, it is sufficient to knaw that people ®t Amqa will pay oust ©ms without trouble whenever as lad to do so, the only fom «f trouble which mi^kt be anticipated is that tJi-? tribes in Jaalan wh© follow Sheikh Ali mi^ht send a contingent to Sur to prevent Aiqa paying customs.

V - Captein B.G. Alban, I.A., Political Agent and Consul, Muscat, With reference to my letter dated the 24th Rabi al Thani 1350 ( 8 th September 1931) and our conversation of two days ago regarding Sur affairs, I now take the opportunity of writing this letter to you. I have already stated in my letter quoted above, that during my visit to sur I introduced the necessary reforms, such as revising the revenue administration, strengthening Government authority, etc. The only question left unsettled,is that of Aiqa, which, together with the preposterous claim of the Shaikh of the Bani Bu Ali ! have already fully explained. As therefore you are in full possession of all the facts X do not propose to touch on them again. In my above letter X asked for your opinion in consultation with the Hon’ble the Resident on this point. I have now reconsidered the matter and arrived at the following conclusion:- (1) I see that I should go to Sur by our boat the * Al Saidl 1 ’, accompanied by 50 men of our levy, from Bait al BalaJ, as guards. On my arrival at Sur I will land at Aiqa and address our subjects, its inhabitants, in connection with their payment of taxes as in the past, p-nd as is now in force in Hillat Urn Qarraitain and all other ports of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, the registration of their boats, and the establishment of a Customs Post at Aiqa for the supervision of imports and exports and the recovery of regular taxes.(2) When all this is accomplished, I will write to the ' Shaikh of the Bani Bu Ali, Ali hin Abdullah bin Salim, Al Hamudah, who is residing at Ja l alan, a subject of His Highness the Sultan, to this effect:- n We have restored Customs control over Aiqa as was the case before and as is in force in all our ports and you, 0* Shaikh, are exempt from taxes on certain articles imported fo^own personal use, from outside, as laid down in Government records; you are allowed to import annually for your own personal use so and so and so mueh * 11 The Shaikh of Bani Bu Ali himself is exempt from the payment of taxes on certain articles which he imports from outside as mentioned above and as this has been the practice in the past, I wish him to continue to enjoy this privilege provided that he obeys the orders of Government. When this has been accomplished our object will have been gained for the present. As I mentioned to you the Shaikh of the Bani Bu Ali has no right to interfere in matters which do not concern him and should he do so again he will be considered a rebel against the authority of Government of which he is a subject. I hope that by the- God’s grace we shall succeed in our object and that the Shaikh of the Bani Bu Ali will no longer be so impudent as to interfere in affairs which do not concern him *id with which he had nothing to do in the past. The &amp; Or eminent of the Sultan of Muscat and Omen will not overlook him in every instance. I have now explained my proposals as I promised you verbally and further we request the Hon’ble Government’s assistance ©t the present Juncture, namely the presence of one of H»M* 3» Ships at Sur while the above arrangements are being carried out. This will be both a threat to the B&amp;ni Bu Ali and a support to us in case of emergency. We are confident of securing from the Hon’ble Government this assistance which our Government has always enjoyedV 3 from olden times. And as you are aware. KC the rehellion ©f f’M our subjects at Khasab, was brought to an end only by the assistance of the Hon^le Government. And we now request the same assistance in this matter in case of any unforeseen hostility by the Bani Bu Aii. We request you to let us know if you approve of this our proposal and if it is possible to obtain the required assistance from the Government. We are entirely prepared to follow your advice in this important matter and are confident that that advice will conduce to nothing but the benefit of our Government. I am sure that you will submit this matter to the Hon*ble Government before operations are commenced. We await your reply. Usual Ending.Ho.

I do not wish to write a long narrative of the incidents uu you ware present and witnessed ~11 what happened. You advised me to call the people of Aiqa at Hiilat Umm ^armitain where I could talk to them about the taxes and the registration of their boats. I accordingly ordered the people of Aida to call on me but they refused to do bo. I then sent the wall for them but they absolutely refused to come as you are aware. On the return of the Wall I addressed a letter to them as per attached copy. They sent a reply which indicates their refusal, &amp; copy of which is herewith enclosed. 1 must say that these subjects of Alta should be punished for their insolence. In my previuos letters I requested assistance from Government, But I have so far not been favoured with a reply. I am sure that you are now convinced that these subjects will never obey our Governments orders if no force is used and if they are not punished the situation will be worse and rather encourage other subjects to rebel. The people of Bur are ail now awaiting the result of this incident. I request H.B.M’s Government to extend their assistance as in the past; their favours are never forgotten and we are certain that they desire nothing but the welfare of our State.I haYe net gone Into long details; in this matter I haYe been guided by your advice and I should therefore feel highly obliged if you would kindly refer this matter to the Hon’ble the Political Resident forwarding at the same time our letter and asking for a reply. Whatever he thinks fit in this important matter we are ready to do as we know that his suggestions and advice will be to the interest of the State of the Sultan oi i&amp;usdcat and Oman. According to the instructions of the Hon’ble the Political Resident and your advice that we should at present send our boat the M Al S&amp;idt* to capture dhows of the Beni Bu All of Aicia and that we should make use of our at Bait ol FalaJ, the boat will be leaving tonight with Salyid Malik bin Faisal and a Jemadar in charge of 15 men of the levy.

X: In continuation of my telegrams H@s. 245 and 246, X the 31so October jg da ted the 28th October, and No.254, dated 1931, I have the honour to forward herewith a translation of a letter and enclosures dated October 30th, 1931, from the president, Council of Ministers, t© me. 2. The letter deals with the recent unexpected visit t© Sur paid by Saiyid Said the President of the Council accompanied by myself. 3. Sur was visited by us ©n October 26th on H.M.S. ’’Penzance’ 1 , we lancted at the old Customs house at Umm Qarimitain, and, after being welcomed by those representa tive sheikhs who were present in Sur, we proceeded to the house of Nasir bin Mohamed, Chief ®f the Aramah Section. 4. This was the president’s triird visit to Sur and as the completion of Sur control was n©w being held up by the residents of Aiqa not being subjected to payment of Customs dues I advised Saiyid Said to send for these people and thresh the matter out with them. 5. On the evening ©f the 26th October therefore, the Beni bu All ©f Aiqa presented themselves before Saiyid Said, and, as I was afterwards informed by him, were very reason able, they said that they had n® objection to paying Customs ©r to registering their boats and that they had not pre viously been asked t© d© these things . At the conclus ion®f the meeting they pr©mised t© return next morning and re sume the discussion. 6 . Naturally, we were all very pleased at what seemed such an eminently proper and right frame of mind ©n the part ©f the Beni bu All. 7. On the next morning, October 27th, Saiyid Bald asked me to be present at the resumption @f the meeting. 8 . Accordingly, I accompanied Saiyid Said to the meeting room,into which, after a few minutes, was ushered the dirtiest collection ©f scallywags I have ever seen. Only one man was decently dressed, and, after the assembly had shaken hands and sat down, Saiyid Said addressed him saying $ t/L that the^e appear t;© be a mere collection ©f Askaris and -/here were the representatives ©f Aiqa who had been ^resent the evening before and had promised to come again in the morning? The man who was one of the influential people of Aiqa replied in a very insolent manner, that they were ail in Aiqa and did not propose to come. 9. Saiyid Said accordingly, and after consulting me, ordered them t© leave the room and t© send for the others at ©nee. 10. After waiting m©re than an hour and a half without result, I suggested that the Wall as representative ©f the Government might be sent to bring them. The Wall accordingly departed accompanied by fifteen or twenty of his Askaris. 11. After another wait ©f an hour, Saiyid Said and I left t® look at the new Customs building on the Kh©r. There we waited ijs for another hour at the end ©f which the Wall with his Askaris returned empty handed with the explanation that he had induced all the leading men t© come as far as the edge of the Kh©r when they had suddenly taken to their heels and scattered int© the houses. 12. Saiyid Said accerdingly wrote the attached letter t© the Beni bu Ali ©f Aiqa anci shortly after We embarked again for IvTuscat. 13. As we were pushing ©ff the reply, attached, reached us3 14* The p©siti©n is, that n@w as always, this sp©t Aiqa reia&amp;uins a blot and a stut^linp dIock to the otherwise easy task of establishing a sound administration at Sur 15. The present incident constitutes a test case. The Beni bu Aii have hinted more than once that the British Government is not really backing the State in its claim that Aiqa must con form to the laws ©f the State and j^ay Customs and all other dues without distinction fr@m ©ther subjects ©f Muscat. The Jeneb&amp;h, having already submitted, are new watching with interest the result ©f this public defiance by the Beni bu All ®f Aiqa. 16. The people of Aiqa are in the difficult position ©f trying to serve tw© masters, if they agree to the demands of the State, then the Sheiida ©f the Beni bu Aii in Jaalan will vent his dis pleasure on them. If they ©bey his orders then they incur the displeasure of the State. 17. In order to make this point clear I advised Saiyid Said to put them t© the test and, they have decided that the dis pleasure of their Sheikh, many miles f away, is mere to be feared than that of the State. 18. In these days of financial depression, Sur trade is doing well and by tightening up control there and preventing Customs leakage a great step will have been taken towards counter balancing an inevitable dr©p in revenues in ©ther parts of the State. If tixe residents of Aiqa wish to persist in their foolish evasion of the law they will only be able t© do so by initiating some aggression up©n the State.

After B&amp;lyid laid 1 s first visit to Bur, Shaikh Ali, possibly having seen how the awry of the State h.© been effectively extended over the Jennebeh, appears to have considered it desirable to com© to terms with the Muscat State, and he therefore wrote to Saiyid Said saying that he desired to discuss various matters with him* Belyid Said therefore proceeded to Aiqa again and a meeting took place at* * * aiilcli ttofi Shaikh Of the Baai Ba ;.U clRiaed on ellowanoe rf 500 a oil or a a nonth, ond agread that a euatoas houae ohauld be eatebUahed at i V . but contended that no taxea ahould be levied on the inhabitants of the village itself, and he added that he could not .be responsible for his followers if they were made to pey euatoas. Seiyid -aid not unnaturally rejected these terms but postponed definite action In this connection to a later date* 7 , At the end of septenber the Council of Unis ter a addressed a letter to the political Agent expressing the view ti»t it was neoesewy to eetn-llen c stems control over • iq&lt;- and that Saiyid Said wished to proceed there with this, object in view, sad Intended to take with him 50 nen of the leviee and proceed in the 'Al Said'. They further stated that Sslyid Said proposed, after having arrived at Alqa and established a custome post there, to inform Shaikh *11 that while cuotoms duty would in future be levied at /iqa, certain articles for hie own personal use would, as previously, be free. The Council of Ministers asked that one of His -ajesty’s ships should bt present at Cur while the above arrargement# were being carried out, both a* a threat to the Baui u li and a* a su .port in case of emergency. Subeequently, as «. .S. 'Pena nce' was visiting Sur on the 23rd October, Saiyid uaid asked if he could be given a passage in her and was informed in reply that there was no objection. He had already been previously informed that under no circumstances oould a sloop give any active assistance, and Saiyid da id was therefore w*ll aware that he could only count on the moral support which a passage in His Majesty's ship gave him. 8 . ..bile I have not yet received details of what exictly took place at Jur, it seems clear that the »anl 3uAil adopted a defiant attitude. Th©^ refused i Saiyid Said and Captain Alban t who wa@ also thea «.4«« the mli who went t* pevnmalXy to induce the leading men to come in* the olitiea! &amp;&amp;mt asked that drafttic measure© should be taken by Hi© ©sty 1 e ship® a© punishment for this action, and recommended dhow® returning fr®a Ba©rah should be searched for and seized. X did not support this proposal for the following reasons* firstly, I felt that every effort had not been mad® to effect a settlement by means of peaceful and friendly discussions; secondly, I felt that His Hajesty 4 © Government and the 1 Government of India would probably contemplate with the greatest reluctance any hostile action by His taj esty* s ships except in the | last resort when definite aggression had been committed, or to protect life and property* I therefore telegra$*hed to the Political Agent, suggesting that the Council should try and intercept the Aiqa dhows with their own State launch and a few levies* These, dhows would presumably pass close outside Muscat and the Hus cat authorities are of course entirely within their rights an taking action of this nature against their subject®. Up to the present however X have not received intimation whether any dhow© have been eeised, and the measure therefore has presum ably been unsuccessful. 9* If so 1 do not think that sm ter© can be allowed to rest where they are now* There are many issue© at stake* firstly, if no control is effected over the ani Bu All residing at i iqa it will obviously have a vary bad effect on the Jennebeh at Bur and in a short time the good work that Xaiyid Said has accomplished will to a large extent be- undone. The prestige of the State would sufier and the political effect would be bad. 10* Secondly, the financial condition of the State, as the Government of India are aware, still occasions a good deal of anxlety * • * 4anxiety, and it is asaential that every penny of revenue to which the State is legitimately entitled ehould toe coUected. the revenue of Aiqa itself is probably not very large, but it is the port ©f a considerable area in the interior, and every peony is of value now to the State# Failure to establish customs control at Ai qa would result in a Xeeseniiijg of the cue toms control at Bur, the effect of which would toe serious. ti, Further, it 1ms been the policy of His Majesty*s Government to support the authority of the Unseat State on the coast, though no^ inland, and it seems to me that it is a very wise policy. A sufficiently effective control can toe maintained over the tribe® in the hinterland, from the coast, as was shown toy the imposition of the penal*which effectively suppressed their rising In 1920 and His Majesty’s Government also supported the authority of the State at Khassab in 1930 by active intervention. On the maintenance of its authority on the coast depend® the stability, political and financial, of the State, and if once tribesmen in the interior can flout the authority of 'the State in these ports the situation will be a serious one. Further/efforts are now toeing made to establish an air route from Muscat to Aden, and it Is essential that law and order should fee maintained along the coast* 12 , For the above reasons I consider it essential thrt the authority of the Muscat State should be established at Aiqa, *oid if the Government of India see no objection I propose to proceed to Sur with Saiyid Said during my forthcoming tour, ami to send for Shaikh Alt and see if it is possible to effect a settlement. If‘the Baal Bu Ali still remain entirely intr&amp;nsigeant then I think there is nothing for it but for the Muscat State to take forcible measures against them, and in such circumstances they can 1 think legitimately ask for the support of Hi® Majesty*® Government, having regard to their own very limited resources. the • •.1uh.&amp; &amp;V6nu£ s of porno© will stll iiaT© be#so eicplorod Rnd tho Shailth will have been offered very liberal ter me for the import of hie own goods, and if hm refutes® to accept Me action can only b© considered &amp;©a deliberate rebellion againet the authority of his suzerain, and trust that in these circumstances His Majesty 1 © Government will be pleased to authorise on© of Hi© Majesty’s ship® to support such measures as the State may take again©t them. 1 will however do my best to render any such action on their part unnecessary ♦ X am ©ending a copy of this despatch to His HaJ©sty t s Secretary of State for India# I have the honour to be.

The Ban! Bu Ali problem has now become a case of the first importance, as far as the State is concerned, both from the Political and Financial aspects. If the Bani Bu Ali are able to defy the State and prevent it collecting Customs dues at Aiqa then Jenebeh will also not unnaturally follow the example. If the Jenebeh refuse to pay revenue then the Batinah ttibes - the Yal Saad etc - will do likewise. Further, as you pointed out to Government .1) in your telegram No.1.77 of 30th Hovember, the case is being ..atched from the interior, and the result will uncoubteaiy have repercussions there also. It is not therefore a question of getting some more thousands of dollars out of bur - tnough that is by no means a negligible factor in itself, it is a2 7 question of the political and financial future of the State, £1 ‘you will see from my report on the financial condition of the \\o) State, my letter Ho.££$3©fDecember 1J31, its future prospects# if reasonable conditions prevail, are fair, and provided that tiie Bani Bu Ali problem is solved successfully I think we may say that it • the State * is convalescent. If the problem is not solved successfully then the State will undoubtedly suffer a relapse, and we shall have a ’‘sick man* on our hands for many years to come. 3. The most iiaportant factor in the problem is of course neither the State nor the Bani Bu Ali but His Majesty’s Govern ment, as it is only they who can give us the ’’Doctor's mandate* to deal with the situation. They will I imagine be more ready to give this if the Bam Bu Ali commit some act ©f definite aggression. It will presumably be our object therefore to get Sheikh Ali into a position in which he will either have to accept the Sate’s terms, or commit an act of aggression against it. Any sort of indefinite ’draw*, even in the State’s favour, would not I think meet the case. 4. ith regard to terms. Without in any way coiamitting you I have discassed this point with S&amp;iyid Said. He only wants three things from the Sheikhs - (a) That Customs dues should be paid in Aiqa# (b) That for this purpose a Customs pest should be established there. (c) That Aiqa (i.e. Bani Bu Ali) dhews should be registered. These are all perfectly reasonable and simple requests. 5. On the other hand Saiyid Said is quite prepared to allow the hheikh the special privileges^and some^thing over, which he has enjoyed in the past. The sheikh has the concession, for instance, of importing 100 bags ©f rice per annum free ©f dues* the value of this is about 0 GO per annum. In order to enforce the principle of collecting Customs dues at Aiq» the simplest plan would perhaps be for the State to compound with the oheikh for the value of his concession in cash, and gaiyid Said isprepared to give Mm more than the $ 30 - which this represents. The exact sum should he sufficiently generous to tempt the Shei&amp;h to accept, and to ^save his face 1 , and at the same time not so large as to appear in the nature ©f blackmail, or to lead otiier uheiichs to put in similar claims. Saiyid Said will be the best judge of the actual amount.{ As you are aware the Sheiich previously demanded ^ 500 per mensem). 6 * ith regard to the intercepted dhow* I suggest that this be given back provided the above terms are accepted, and it seems lively that they will be carried out. 7. When you see the Sheikh at Sur either he will accept the above terms,(if you approve that they should be put to him), or he will refuse them. If he takes the former line then either he will abide loyally by the terms, ©r when our backs are turned he will later repudiate the agreement and shoot up the Aiqa Customs post, ©r threaten to do so if it is not evacuated, or some thing of that sort. This will be a definite act of aggression. d. If ne j, Icitly refused the terms tn.en wne only course for us to pursue would seem to be to carry them out by force, and have the Aiqa Customs post - the sign ©f the State*© authority » established under the guns of a sleep. Following on this three eventualities are possible:- (a) The establishment of the Customs Pest will be resisted in which case the sloop will have to use her guns. (b) Or it will be accepted and this display of our determina tion to see things through will be sufficient to cow the Sheikh for good and all. (c) Or it will be accepted and when the sloop has sailed away - she cannot stay there for ever - the Sheikh will take action as described at the end of para 7 above. J. ,ith regard to the amount ©f force to be used, if force should prove necessary. I have referred above t© ’'a'* sloop. It would be preferable, however, if jnere than one were employed. % , The Arabs themselves have a proverb that * the Arab’s understanding^4 m is in his eyes’, i.e. that he only realises what he see?, and f ,, , _ _ . / , ... A .. , , . , j / greater thi show of force which Sheikh All and his tribesmen actually see the less likely is it that this force will actually have to he used. In the Yal Saad ’show* of 1922 (vide letter ?! Ko*976 of 28th December 1922 from the Political Hesident to the Foreign Secretary, Government of India) only one sloop was used to begin with. Then another was brought up, and finally a third# It is possible that if more force had been concentrated in the beginning the Yal Saad might have climbed dovhi without a shot being fired^or at any rate the desired effect might have been produced in a shorter period. pressure can be brought to bear on the inhabitants of 10 Aiqa by stopping ingress or egress of their dhows. The most convenient seasons for doing this are indicated in para 8 of my letter Ho. 83-C of 8 th July 1930. This action of course does not directly affect the hani Bu All of the interior, though the Sheikh could not ignore it as the people of Aiqa belong to his tribe, and in the present instance of the intercepted Aiqa dhow he has made protests to the State. The Bani Bu Ali of Jaalan have two or three sxualler ports of their own south of a&amp;s al Had} Lashkarah etc,whence - so the Customs Director General informs me - two or three large Bani Bu Ali dhows ply to India etc. where these dhows aestivate is uncertain! presumably Sur or Khor Jaramah. The interception of these craft would bring some direct pressure on the Bani Bu Ali* 11. In my telegram quoted above I suggested the possible use of air-craft. If the Bani Bu Ali prove obstinate then the best way of dealing with them, in addition to naval action , will be by bombing the Sheikh’s headquarters which are situated about 40 miles inland in Jaaian. Such action may not be necessary, but should it prove so then preliminary sanction from His Majesty s Government would be very useful. Otherwise ii naval action is insufficient, operations would have to be suspended while permission to use air-craft was obtain.4, ano this suspension would of course encoura5 P»S* Reference para 2 above* I bear that the Yal Saad Sheikh, who happened to be in Muscat tne last few ..... . 1 • . ’.' r « days, evinced considerable interest in the bur situation* He had apparently heard rumours that the new Customs house there had been burnt to the ground by the Ban!

After compliments, I am writing to confirm what I told you verbally today, namely that the British Government can no longer tolerate the defiance of the authority of the Muscat State on the coast# The State have the right to collect customs duty at Aiqa and to require the people of Aiqa to register their dhows, and the British Government are ready to support the State in their just demands# You have the right to exemption of customs duty on goods imported for yourself, up to a certain amount, and this the Muscat State are ready to give you# We discussed the matter for a long time today,and finally the State made you the following offer. (i) that they should not build a customs house in Aiqa, but should rent a house from you. (ii) that of the four customs guards at Aiqa, two should be Beni Bu Ali. (iii) the State would in future pay you a month instead of the ^ 100 that they pay you at present, In return you would admit the right of the State to collect customs dues and register dhows at Aiqa. I am writing this so that there may be no misunderstanding. And I again advise you, 0 Shaikh, to agree to this liberal settlement.

Repeated: secretary of state for India,London Ho. T.100* Dated the 15th December 1931 ^ M Reference Secretary of State’s telegram Bo. 3585 of 10th December. SUR. I had a long interview with shaikh Ali, in presence of Saiyid Said and Political Agent. He was informed of Itate’s demands for levy of customs dues and registration of dhows, with personal exemption for himself, end that demands had support of His Majesty’s Government. He maintained that AIQA belonged to Seni Bu Ali, who were independent of Muscat State vnd that latter had no right to collect customs dues, although customs accounts were produced showing that they had paid up to 6 years ago. Finally he was told that if he would agree to terms State would (i) rent house in AIQ^A for customs post instead of building new post (ii) would employ 2 of Bani Bu Ali as customs guards and (iii) would double his present subsidy of 100 dolxars mur munsam as q fMnnim&amp;Ation for loss of revenue he had been2. I think we must now grasp the nettle % Saiyid Said however i s averse from taking action during month of Ramzan as he considers it would be unfavourably regarded by public opinion and I agree. Ramzan commences 9th January, and it would be difficult to take action earlier without in convenience, and there is no immediate hurry* 1 recommend therefore that if Ali # s reply is unfavourable State should in form him thut while no action will be taken against him during Hamzan, following month steps will be taken to enforce compliance with their demands* This will give him further time for reflection* 3* I have not yet discussed details with Air Officer Commending who has gone t© BHGFAR but rejoins me Friday when t will submit my proposals after consultation with him ond Senior Havel Officer* - RESII2BHT- • • • Copy forwarded to the Political Agent, Muscat.

I have no other reply besides this’*. '•Full year’* may possibly mean end of the Arabic year i.e. May. I have shown letter to Saiyid Said.

Do you approve?The Political Agency &amp; H.B.M’s Consuia Muscat, the &lt;i2ncl December 19 31, N©.C-2i^ ©f 1931, To The Kon'ble the political Resident in the Persian Gulf Bushire Memorandum V In continuation of ruy telegram Ho.290 of date I enclose herewith the letter from Shaikh Ali referred to with a translation. It is possible# as I pointed, out in ray telegram, that 'after a full year' may mean 'at the end of the year' though the ¥/ords used do not indicate this. If he had meant at the end of the year he should have written ^ ^^On the other hand the Aiqa dhows, 'people of the coast', d© return to Aiqa about Apri1-May the end of the Arabic year. However this may be his reply is merely the old Arab device ©f pr®cr*,Btinati©n. The 'people of the coast' have nothing to do with the question as to whether the Aiqa should pay Customs duest that is the right of the Sta,te. 2. Of course we can prevent the Aiqa dhows entering Sur in April-May, but this means having a sloop hanging about Sur day and night for about 6 weeks, as the exact dates of return of the dnows is of course not xnown. Conversely we can allow the Aiqa dhows to enter and say that they will not be permitted to come out until the State’s terms have been agreed t©. But first-pressure ©n the people of Aiqa does not affect so closely the Ban! Bu Ali of Jaalan, and second*'this action will postpone a decision until after the monsoon i.e. about September of next year. The Aiqa people will, Arab fashion, simply2 . sit tiglit until tbe time f©r their exodus approaches, I think therefore, a© indicated in my telegram* that we should take action as ©riginally decided after Ramazan. H©w soon, or how long after* Ramazan we take action we can of course choose to suit ourselves. 3 . One very important point whikh occurs to me is the security of the Flying Base. The obvious choiee is iOior Jerama, if Flying Boats are to be usedj if aeroplanes then there is a landing ground at Ras-al-Kadd. If the former then they could fly round to Lashkarah and then inland to Balad Bam Bu All. As you are aware we were rather rushed during your visit and had many other matters to discuss and there was no immediate hurry. After your departure, however* I discussed this point informally with Group-Captain Welsh. Under instructions from the Air Vice-marshal he was sending a flying boat* under command of Flight hieutenant Ragg, to Has Madraka to make a reconnais sance of a kh©r near there, the Boat to start on the aiter- noon of the 18th and spend the night *t Khor Jerama• I suggested that I should accompany the Boat, which would leave me at the hi or to pick local information, and picx me up on her way back. This suggestion was welcomed. We left Muscat on the afternoon of the xSth and returned to Muscat on the morning of the 20th. 4 . x had a letter from Saiyid Said for the Shaikh of Ras-al-Hadd which merely asked him to meet me at Chor Jerama. This I sent him on my arrival there, and he duly turned up. I did not of course say anything aoout possible operations against the Bani Bu Ali, but simply established friendly relations with him, and made some enquiries. * r@m what he said and what Saiyid Said informed me I gleaned the following. 5. The Bani Amer, whose head is the Shaikh ©f5, Ras-al-Hadd, one Shaikh Saif bin Salim by name, hold territory in a sort ©f semi-circle from Khor Rm/vais to oetween hh©r Jer&amp;ma and Sur. South ©f their border c@me the Ban hu Ali and Ban Bu Hassan* The territory of the former due south is aoout 20 miles away from Khor Jerama, but t© the east^may come considerably ciese^. Hew the borders of the 3 ani Bu Ali and Bani Bu Hassan run I had no time t© iind out* But B&amp;lad Bani Bu Ali is apparently ©nly some 20 miles inland from Laskkarah, and Balad Bani Bu Hassan ©nly some 6 miles or s© further inland again from Baiad Bani Bu Ali* 6 * The Bani Amer are on good terms with both the Bani Bu All and the Bani Bu Hassan* They ©wn some date greves in the territory of the latter, but not in that of the former. The Bam Bu Ali* who are Ghafiris ? have a standing feud with the Bani Bu Hassan. who are Hanawis. Saiyid Said ^ informed me that it was quite likely that if the Ban! Bu Ali were bombed the Bani Bu Hassan would tajce the ©pportunity to attack them* 7* , putting oneself in the place ©f the Bani Bu Ali, if one really meant business one would at some stage in the proceedings, probably after the first bomoing, send a party down t© shoot X^the flying boats at Khor J erama, ©r the aeroplanes at Rae-al-IIadd* Ab all events this contengency must be ta^en into account, and guarded against* Plight Lieutenant Ragg and I looked at various place© ever-looking tLe Flying B*ats wicherage wheno/ferned iiests would have te be ^JAced. The garrisons for the ^ssts osuld conveniently come iryia the Bani l^mer* (which idea Saiyid Said- when I put it t© him — seemed to think feasible), and by the Lusc&amp;t Infantry, These might be reinforced by the presence of a sleep* H©w many men would be required could oe e&gt;one ^nt© later. In order to reach Lhor Jerama the Bani Bu Ali would have to infringe Bani Amer territory, which would not betii G i. jf ii A 1 *. 1 . ja £4 aj G S 1 * Cii.Ii be estabiished, similar action will pspular with the latter and render them willing to cooperate with us. They would be paid by the State for their services. If land planes were used freia Ras-al-Hadd, similar protection would be necessary. 3ani 8 . The outstanding feature of Balad/lu Ali is their fort ©f which they are very proud, so Saiyid Said informed Gav 'Vw.g, me. It exceptionally large one, and Saiyid Said gave^ some photographs ©f it which Mr. Themas took during his journey t© Jaalan in 192S. (There is a description of this journey in his '’Alarms and Excursions in Arabia”, but little that is of interest from our present point of view). I showed tne photographs t© Flight-lieutenant Kagg who was of ©pinion that tne fort Si. ould ©ffer a good bombing object. 9 . You will remember that we discussed what should be the line we should ta.se with Shaiih Ali when the time for operations drew near. We decided that it should be such that we should not be committed to continue bombing and bombarding until Shaiich Ali sighed a document agreeing t© the State’s terms. An Arab will often tacitly give way t® f@ree when he will refuse to sign a document acknowledging a surrender. The first step will presumably be i©r the %xxt to i ix haiaa bariih'iAli 4 ? 4 +. ‘ 7 V 1 r Via 't - *&lt;4 done, an d R.A.F. ,/and get aerial pn®tos of it.

Bu Ali. 3 , With reference to para 6 of my letter No.G-269 of 22nd December 1931. Saiyid Said informs me that the Bani Bu Hassan have written to him to the effect that they have heard that there are differences between the State and the Bani Bu All* and that they - the Bani Hassan are always at the disposal of the State. Owing to the recent Killing of a Bani Bu Hassan by the Bam Bu Aii the former jusr at present are apparently on particularly bad terms with tne latter. 4. with reference to your Express Letter No.C-41 of 13th December 193X. The Vair of our will keep us informed of what is happening there.

Should punitive action be necessary one warship is doubtless sufficient for the demolition of Aiqa Fort, and for making Aiqa untenable by 3h&amp;: ich All and his followers. At the same time the greater the show of strength we make the less likely is it that we will have to use it (para 9 of my letter No.C-282 of 9th December), the impression and the more perm&amp;nent^which will be made primarily on the Bani Bu Ali, and secondly on the Jenebeh whom it would be no harm to impress though they are on their best behaviour at present. One must remember too that the Suris as a whole are quite accustomed to single warships making bombardment of their port, vide para 6 of my letter ho.Sl-C of 12 th February 1931. I venture to suggest therefore that two other sloops should jus accompany the sloop in which Saiyid Said and I visit Sur. I am aware that tii^ may cause dislocation of the laval program#, for February, and that it may not be possible to fail in with my suggestion, but it would, I thin*, te a good thing if it could be arranged. 5.

The object of the visit will be merely to get personal touch with the local feeling there, and pic* up the latest news about the attitude of the Bani Bu All.

With regard to the likelihood of a Bani Bu Ali raid on the air-craft base, it is interesting to note tnat in February 1321 a force of British and Indian Troops, on its way to Balad Bani Bu Ali to avenge the defeat there of a former expedition in the previous year, disembarked at Sur. Imagining itself secure the force failed to take proper precautions, and three hundred of the Bani Bu Ali,making a march of 50 miles from Jaalan, attacked the sleeping camp at night before they were discovered. They were repulsed after some hard fighting, hut with a l.ss to the force of 16 Killed and 26 wounded.(Vide Frontier and Overseas ■vj Expeditions from India Volua.^257.) 2. we reached Sur on the evening of the 19th when the Sail came on board, captain Clayton kindly asked Saiyid Said and me to dine on hoard the -Emerald'. ~ pnth Saiyid Said landed at Bur On the morning of the18 r«ii! f 2 . oeing given his salute by the 'Bideford', which went on t© Ras-al-H&amp;cid. There I went ashore with Coimnander McGrath and the Jemadar and had a friendly reception from Shaikh Saif of the Bani Amer in his village (see my letter quoted above para 5)* I gave the Shaikh a letter from Saiyid Said asking him to return on board the 'Bideford' to Sur where he ** Saiyia Said «• wished to have a discussion with him* Commander McGrath, the Jemadar and I examined the vicinity of the village tor about 3 hours, and drew up a rough scheme for the defence of the landing ground from possible raids of the Bani Bu Ali, the scheme including a sloop, the Al Saidi, 2 platoons of the Muscat Infantry (60 men), and Bani Amer friendlies. The Shaikh, with his brother, accompanied us back on board ship, which then left for IChor Jeramah. 3. Sub-Lieu tenant Langmore, the Jemadar and I went ashore at Khor Jeramah in the afternoon and made another reconnaissance. The scheme of defence^ which was shown t© Commander McGrath^included as before a sloop, the Al Saidi, 2 platoons of Muscat Infantry and friendlies from the Bani Amer* An important factor in the scheme is whether a sloop can enter the Khor or not. I have handed over both the schemes to Captain Alban who arrived at Muscat on the 23rd instant. 4. The 'Bideford' returned to Sur on the morning of the 21st when Saiyid Said was re-embarked. He informed me that all was quiet in Sur and that there was no particular news from Jaalan. He confirmed the fact that the Bani Bu Hassan were on vartiouiarly bad terms with the Bani Bu Ali (my letter Ko»G*l ©1' 5th January .para 5, 5. Saiyid Said had a conversation with Shaiich Saif on board. The latter professed his wiilingness to help the State, should it be necessary, and stated that the latter could count on his tribe. Another tribe, however, the3 Ba/ii Ghazal share with the Bani Amer the Ras-al-Hadd-— -Khor Jaramah area* The Shaiich could not answer for them but M } thought the/ would be willing to join in. The trip was a successful one. Saiyid Said's 6 visit to our on board a sloopj especially with the presence of the 'Emerald*', had a good moral effect* and his conver sation with Shaikh Saif was satisfactory. The plan of the defence of air**craft at Ras-al-Hadd and Khor J'eraiaah* even though tentative and subject to alteration, should prove useful if necessity arises, and it is obvious^better that this question of defence should be considered at liesure now than in a hurry at the last moment.

With reference to Secret Memorandum KeoS-10573 from Air Headquarters Iraq Command a copy ©f which I have received, and our conversation ©n the subject. 2. I attach herewith in duplicate extracts from my letters to the Hon’ble the political Resident which contain information as to Ras-al-Hadd—Kher Jeraaa — and the Bani Bu Ali. With regard to the plans of defence for Has al Hadd and Khor Jerana drawn up by a® during a tour I took in H.F.S.’’Bideford« (my letter/1© A p.R.Ho.C-15) and which I handed over to Captain Alban. I should like to emphasise the fact that the are are merely tentative, as I explained to you, and are of course subject to any alterations which the authorities concerned consider necessary. fou have already dis cussed the plans with Captain Alban who is accompanying you today for a reconnaissance ot Ras-al-Hadd and Khor Jerama. 3. With reference to para 5 of the Secret memorandum quoted above. (a) There would see® to be only two villages concerned: one Balad Bani Bu Ali&gt; with its large fort, and the other Balad Bani Bu Hassan* (Balad means village or dwelling place). The\ Bani Bu Hassan are friendly to tke State and hostile to the Bani Bu KLi (£iy letter^to P.R,K®.0-1 para 3) I have never visited either the Bani Bu Ali or the Bani Bu Hassan country. Only one officer has done so to the Best of jay knowledge Mr. Thoms, late financial Adviser to the Muscat State (my letter! to P.K. Ho. C-2S9 para 8 ). (b) No remarks. (c) The Bani Amer (my letters to P.R. No.C-289 para 5, 6 \c and 015 far a 5), are friendly to the State. They are not strong enough in theaselves to prevent the Bani Bu Ali molesting the H Rangoons', but could be reinforced by 60 men of the Muscat Infantry. If in addition it was decided to have a sloop in the Khor, and a sloop could enter, it would of course add considerably to the security ©f the Plying Boats. The Bani Bu Ali have a reputation for night attacks [mj j letter| to P.R. No.C-15 para 1). (d) The use of the Rhor for refuelling and bombing up instead of as a base would of course necessitate less measure of protection for the plying Boats.

The Bani Amer are on good terms with both the Bani Bu Ali and the Bani Bu Hassan* They own so me date greves in the territory of the latter, but not in that of the former* The Bani Bu Alit who are Ghafiris, have a standing feud with the Bani Bu Hassan who are Hanawis* Saiyid Said informed me that it was quite li^exy that if the Bani Bu Ali were bombed the Bani Bu Hassan to attack them* 7* Putting oneself in the place would take the opportunity of the Bani Bu Ali, if one really meant business one would at some stage in the proceedings, probably after tne first bombing, send a party do on to shoot up the flying boats at Khor jreraina, or the aeroplanes at Ras-al-Hadd. At all events this conten t ency must be taken into account, and guarded against, j?light lieutenant Hagg and I looked at various places over-looking the Plying Boats anchorage where armed posts would have to d© placed. The garrisons for the posts could conveniently some from the Bani Amer, (which idea Saiyid Said - wnen I jjut it t© him - seemed to think feasible), and from the Unseat Infantry. These might be reinforced by the presence ot a Sloop. How many men would be required could be gone into later. In order to reach Khor Jerame the Bani Bu Ali would aave to infringe Bani Amer territory, which would not be papular with the latter and render then willing to cooperatevith us. They would be ^aid by the State for tueir services. If land planes were used fro. Ras-al-Hadd, similar protection would be necessary* 8 . The outstanding feature of Balad Ban! Bu All is their fort ©f which they are very proud, so Saiyid Said informed me* II is an exceptionally large one, and Saiyid Said gave me sume photographs of it whfcch Mr. Thomas took during his journey t© Jaal&amp;n in 1928. (There is a description of tnis j ourney in his 'Alarms and Excursions in Arabia', but little that is ©f interest from our present point of view).

With reference to jj&amp;rsL 6 of my letter Kg. C-289 ©f 22nd December 1931. Saiyid Said informs me that the Bani Bu Hassan have written to him to the effect that they have heard that there are differences between the State and the Bani Bu Ali, and that they - the Bani Bu Hassan - are always at the disposal of the state. Owing to the recent killing ©f a Bani Bu Hassan by the Bani Bu Ali the former just at present are apparently on particularly bad terms with the latter. x x x /p h Q 0 Ko.C-15, dated the 25txi January 1932.

Imagining itself secure the force failed to take proper precautions, and three hundred ©f the Bani Bu Ali, jmking a march of 50 miles from Jaaiun, attacked the sleep ing camp at night before they were discovered* They v\ere repulsed after some hard fighting, but with a less to the force of 16 Killed and 26 wounded. (Vide Frontier and Overseas Expeditions from India Volume VI page 257.) 2. We reached Sur on the evening of the x9th when the Wall came on board. On the morning of the 20th Saiyid bald landed at Sur being given his salute by the ’♦Bideford', which wefct on to Ras-al-K&amp;ud. There 1 went ashore with Commander McGrath and the Jemadar and had a friendly reception from Shaikh Saif of the Bank Auer in hie village (see my fetter quoted above para 5). I gave the Shaikh a letter from Saiyid Said asking him to return on board the 'Bideiord* to Sur where he - Saiyid Said - wished to have a discussion with h~ia* Commander McGrath, the jemadar and I examined the vicinity of the village for about 3 hours, and drew up a rough scheme for the defence of the landing ground from possible raids ©f the Bani Bu Ali, the scheme including a sloop, the Ai Saidi, 2 platoons of the Muscat Infantry (60 men), and Bani Amer friendlies. The Shaiah, with his brother, accompanied us back on beard ship, which then left for Khor Jeramah. 3. Sub-Lieutenant Laugmore, the Jemadar ana I went ashore at Ahor Jeramah in the afternoon and made another reconnaissance.

I have handed over lotii the schemes to Captain Alban uho arrived at Muscat on the 22rd instant. 4. The H Bidei ord H returned to Sur on the xaorning of the 21st when Saiyid Said was re-embarked. He informed me that all was quiet in Sur and that there was no particular news from Jaalan. He confirmed the fact that the Bani Bu Hassan were on particularly bad terms with the Bani Bu Ali {my letter ho.C-1 of the 5th January para 3). 5. Saiyid Said had a conversation v. ith SnaiJch Saif ©n board. The latter professed his willingness to heljo^ the State, should it Le necessary, and stated that the latter could count on his tribe. Another tribe, however, the Ban! GLftz&amp;l share with the Bani Aner the Raa-al-Hadd - Khor Jeramah area. The Sheikh could net answer for them but thought they v/ould be willing to join m* / \ 6 . Tne trip was a successful one. Saiyid Said ! s visit to Sur on board a sloop, especially with the presence of the w Emerald M , had a good saoral effect, and his conversation with Shaikh Said was satisfactory, ^he plan of the defence of air-craft at Hasdai—Hadd and Khor Jeraaah, even though tentative and subject to alteration, should prove useful if necessity arises.Gist of a letter dated 17th Ramazan 1350 (26-1-32) Irom Shaikh Sulaiman tin Hamyar tin Hasir to H.H.

Saiyid Said says that he has postponed his demands out of regard for Ramazan; what was suggested to us by the Political Resident that is:- The Muscat Government has the right to collect taxes from Aiqa, to register its dhows and to appoint at Aiq© four guards to collect taxes. They will hire a house for them (guards) from us and allow us iS 100 as compensation for Aiqa taxes and registration of dhows, in addition to the first hundred.

Y x k£ ve replied thax there is coming to you after the Id a trustworthy man; perhaps the matter can be settled without any trouble. I hat is left for us to do is to put these conditions in writing, the fixation of the period of the agreement and the recognition of our possession. The agreement would especially be for the Aiqa taxes and registration of dhows and nothing else.

The Government of Muscat would pay compensation for the taxes of Aiq© ^ 100 per mensem in addition to the pay fixed formerly for ray father and exemption from customs dues of a certain quantity of goods arriving for me at the Customs of Sur. I accept all this on the condition that you would write us a document. The number of the years of the agreement should also be mentioned in it which should be in our hands.

BP as you are aware there^has late been trouble between the i! 1 '' - ■ ' f ^ jjani Bu All and ourselves. The cause has been the completely unjustifiable interference ox the Shaixch of Bani Bu Ali, Shaikh Ali A1 Hamudah, m the aflairs of our port of Sur where he has refused to allow our Customs post to be placed in the port of Sur which is known as Aiqa, or to allow the inhabitants of Aiqa to pay Customs dues or to register their dhows. In company with the Hon’ble the Political Resident we saw Shaikh Ali at Sur about 2 months ago , and requested him to cease his interference in Aiqa. He refused. Because we desire peace we exercised patience with him.and endeavoured to persuade him to give up his rebellious attitude . Again he refused, nevertheless we still exercised patience and offered him very liberal terms so that he would in no way be the loser by the establishment of our Customs control over Aiqa. He persisted in his refusal. Having done all that was possible peacefully, we informed Sh Shaikh Ali that we would take no steps against him during the sacred month of namaz an, but that on its conclusion we would . take action to enforce our demands. At tne same time we informed Shaikh Ali, as we had been authorised to do ^ by the Hon’ble the Political Resident, that in maxing these demands we had the support of the British Government. If Shaikh Ali does not accept our terms before the time of action arrives, and harm should come to him and his people because of his disobedience, you will understand that we are not responsible.

Discussed at length is the issue of ensuring the collection of customs and the registration of dhows at Aiqa.Most of the correspondence is between the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Other notable correspondents include the following: the Secretary of State for India; the Commanding Officer at Air Headquarters, Iraq Command; Saiyid Said bin Taimur [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd], President of the Council of Ministers, and later Sultan of Muscat and Oman; Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah Al Hamudah, Amir of Ja'alan [Emir of Ja‘lān] and Shaikh of Aiqa.Related matters of discussion include the following: the reported prolonged evasion of customs by the Bani Bu Ali in Aiqa; the level of assistance that should be provided by the British in order to help Muscat assert control in Sur and Aiqa (e.g. whether it is necessary to send HMS sloops to Sur); the interception of an Aiqa dhow by a Muscat State patrol vessel on 12 November 1931; preparations for 'punitive action' against Aiqa by the British – including a planned reconnaissance mission ahead of possible aerial bombardment, and discussion of naval bombardment – in the event of the Shaikh opposing the establishment of a customs post there.The Arabic language material mainly consists of correspondence between the Political Agent, the Shaikh of Aiqa, and Saiyid Said bin Taimur (English translations are present in most cases).All the material dates from the period 1931-1932, with the exception of some brief notes at the end of the volume, which are dated November 1939.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>President of the Council of Ministers</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Officer Commanding, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Ja'alān</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Banī Bū 'Alī (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Sur</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Aiqa</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Aerial reconnaissance</topic></subject><subject><topic>Tribes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003d4#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
