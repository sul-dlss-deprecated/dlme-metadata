My dear Hijh Corrrdssioner, The questions dealt with in your letter of. the 16th August to the Secret air’ of State regarding- the draft Treat' r betv/een the Uniced i-ingdOiU and i .u sc at have been carefull’’ consiaei ed oy tiie conioetent Denartments of Lis Ha.lesty 1 s Government in the United Kingdom, and I am now in a position to co.nmunicate to you the viev/s of Lis 1.1 a jesty ? s Government on the points raised. Tne Articles of the draft Treaty to which His Majesty';: Government in the Union have called attention fall into two categories, namely, Articles 1, 20 a.nd 21, which are general provisions of a type which it has been customary for many years past to include in general Commercial Treaties negotiated on behalf of the United Kingdom, and Articles 1 , 14 and 15 which i elate to ti*e securing of special extra-territorial rights in the territories of the Sultan of Muscat, and it will be convenient to deal separately with these two categories. As stated aoove, tne Articles in the first category follow existing practice in regard to the draft ng of Commercial Treaties. ihis practice is based on the recorumendat. ons contained in a Keport of the Drafting Committee of the Inter- Imperial Delations Coriimittee of the Imperial Conference of 1930 whicn were accepted by the representatives of the Governments then pj.ese.uo, except tnose of the Irish Tree State j a cony of the Deport of the Committee is annexed for convenience of i eference. Since that time .His majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have included provisions based on the recommend ations of the Deport in all their draft Commercial Treaties; I. te Water, Esq. recent/A .1 -A r 2 . recent examples may Tse found in the Commercial Treaty with Siam, signed on the 23rd November, 1937 (Treaty Series Ho.33 (1938) - Cmd. 5731) and the Commercial Treaty with the French and Tangier Zones of Morocco signed on the 18th July last (Cmd. 5823). As nothing occurred during the Imperial Conference of 1937 to suggest that the recommendations of 1930 should be departed from, His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom have felt bound, in the absence of an indication that a change is desired by all the Governments concerned, to adhere to the practice recommended in 1930. I should add, as regards the proposed Treaty with Muscat, that, as the terms of the draft have now been agreed with the Sultan of Muscat, and as the conclusion of a new Treaty is urgently required in replacement of the existing Treaty which is shortly due to expire, we feel that it would be impracticable to suspend the final conclusion of the proposed Treaty pending consultation between the Governments concerned; we should not, of course, wish to suggest that this would preclude such consultation as to the inclusion of provisions of this character in future Commercial Treaties. The provisions of the draft Treaty with Muscat relating to extra-territorial jurisdiction (i.e. Articles 13, 14 and 15) stand on a somewhat different footing. In the first place, however, it may be pointed out that the provisions of the new Treaty do not involve any change in this respect, but are designed substantially to maintain existing rights. Moreover, in the case of a small country like Muscat where the native courts are extremely primitive and the local laws unsuitable in many respects for application to persons of Nuropean origin and where there is no institution such as the Mixed Courts in Hgypt as an alternative, the right of recourse to a Court maintained by the United Kingdom and the application of the law of British India rather/0® 'N 5. rather than local law must ? it is thought 5 he considered as indisputable a benefit, as are any of the other rights proposed to he obtained for British subjects generally under other provisions of the Treaty. The discussions which took place at the time of the Imperial Conference, 1937, and subsequently, regarding the application of extra-territorial jurisdiction, were understood by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to be related to the exercise of jurisdiction when obtained by treaty and not to the question of treaty provisions. They would consequently be more relevant to the later stage, namely, the issue of Orders in Council for the exercise of rights secured by treaty. The United Kingdom Government do not wish to dissent from the view that in general the exercise of extra-territorial jurisdiction in foreign countries in respect of British subjects belonging to the Union of South Africa must be regarded as exercised with the consent of His Majesty’s Government in the Union; they would be quite willing, if the Union Government should so desire, that the Order in Council which will eventually require to be passed for the exercise of such jurisdiction should be expressed to be passed at the request and with the consent of the Union Govern ment, or, alternatively, if that course were preferred, that the Union authorities should themselves make the necessary arrange ments for passing the Order required in respect of British subjects belonging to the Union. We feel, however, that the Union Government may well consider that Muscat, by reason of its special position, can properly be treated as standing in a different position from other foreign countries where extra territorial jurisdiction is or has been until recently enjoyed, such as China, Bgypt and Morocco. Legally and technically, Muscat is an independent State and His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom do not exercise jurisdiction there over foreigners/mmforeigners in general. In practice ? however ? owing to the influence exercised there through the Government of India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; Muscat stands in a special position which has considerable resemblance to that of a British protected State. In the case of British protected states - as for example the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms of Koweit and Bahrein - it is assumed that His Majesty’s Government in the Union would not think of questioning the right of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to exercise juris diction over the rights of persons belonging to the Union as over other classes of British subjects? and other non-natives such as United States citizens or French nationals. Having regard to the special position of Muscat? it is thought that the Union Government may feel it preferable to adopt a similar attitude to the exercise of extra-territorial jurisdiction in Muscat and not to regard it as necessary to indicate by one or other of the means outlined above that authority in the territory concerned over British subjects belonging to the Union is exercised on the advice of His Majesty’s Government in fhe Union. An early expression of the views of the Union Government on the question of the Order in Council for the continued exercise of extra-territorial jurisdiction of Muscat would be appreciated? as we should like to proceed as soon as possible with the drafting of the necessary Order. The necessity for bringing the new Treaty into force next February and the time required for the various legal formalities would make it very desirable to put this in hand at the latest by the middle of December, and, if we have not heard further from the Union Crovernment by then? we trust that we may assume that they concur in a draft being prepared on the basis suggested above. Yours sincerely, Sd. Devonshire.f P.Z.7066/38. T.57^39 DOMINIONS OFFICE, S.W.l. 14th October, 1938. Dear Scallan, The Secretary of State’s letter of today’s date replies to the High Commissioner's letter of the 16th August on the subject of the draft Commercial Treaty with Muscat. There are two points not dealt with in the K. Scallan, Secretary of State's letter which I have been asked to mention to you informally. You will see that in paragraph 5 of the Secretary of State’s letter he refers to the question of consultation with the other Governments of^the British Commonwealth concerned. We have not included in the letter any suggestion as to the mode of consultation as we assume that, ii the Union Government wish to pursue the matter, they might prefer to undertake such consultation themselves. We should, of course, be quite willing to do so if the Union Government desired. In paragraph 5 of the Secretary of State's letter, the question of consultation as to the use of the provisions in question in future Commercial Treaties is also mentioned, I ought to say that there are several ' other Commercial Treaties now in contemplation, the drafts of which include provisions of the kind in question, e.g. with Chile, and Colombia, negotiations for which have already begun, as the Union Government have been informed. I have been asked to say that, while we do not wish to prejudice the general question, we feel that it might be rather embarrassing for us if the suggestion were made Esq# that/. - 2 . that we should suspend action on such treaties, ending consultation with the other Governments. We hope very much therefore that this point will not he raised. Y ours since rely ? (Sgd.) J.E.

Dated 18th November,1938. No. P.Z.7662/38. Reference my telegram of the 17th November, No. 1979. Muscat Treaty. I enclose coTjy of the Arabic text which it is proposed, subject to your views and with the Sultan’s concurrence^, to adopt in preparation of signature copies. It embodies certain corrections in t he tex t which has already boen agreed upon with the Sultan (including revised text of Articles 12 and 19 enclosed with your express letter of the 4th November, No. 555-8). These corrections, which are understood to be self-explanatory, are considered essential for grammatical or other reasons. If you see no objection please consult Sultan and telegraph His Highness’s views. 2. You will observe that translator has inserted in Arabic your name and designation in the preamble and your name in the signature clause. If any corrections are required here please indicate them. 3. Certain minor changes have also been made in the English text which however will presumably not require to be mentioned to the Sultan. Apart from improvements in punctuation these arc - (a) In Article l(ii), lines 2 and 8, omit ”the term”. Repetition of these words is avoided in sub-sections (i)(iii) and (iv) of the Article. (W/2. (Id) In Article 13(3), line 2, substitute ‘’nor' for tl or u , (c) The following corrections are required in the list of amendments enclosed with your letter to the Sultan of the 8th July:- (i) Article 2(l), 19th line. The amendment should he - Before 11 shall*' insert 11 they'. (ii) Article 11. The phrase to he substituted should he 'v/hosenational he may he'. (iii) Article 13(1). The amendment should read 'subject to any right of appeal which Kis Majesty may provide'. This correction involves a change in the Arabic text also, which has been made in the enclosed copy. A corrected copy of the English text is enclosed. 4. You will note that in English text your signature will precede that of Sultan. This is due to fact that treaty will he printed for signature in a form which v/ill not permit space for the signatures side by side. This also applies to signature copies in Arabic. There would bo no objection in principle to Sultan's signature preceding yours in the Arabic copies, but this would involve reversal of order of names in the preamble and the signature clause of the Arabic text. This could no doubt be arranged, if you think it desirable, but as Arabic translation accepted by Sultan follows English text he will presumably not object to order of signatures also following that of the English copies. The issue of the above has been duly authorised. iSWd.l J.

To allow this would not only be derogatory to the Union’s position as an independent state but would also oe in conflict with the provisions of section 7 of one Royal bxocutive .Functions and Seals Act, 1934 (Act No. 70 of 1934). i His Majesty’s Government in the Union, therefore, feci bound to take action under section 7 of the said Act, and to advise the Governor-General to issue a proclamatioxj. of the nature of the attached draft as coon as the relevant Order-in- Oouncil has been issued by the King-in-Council at ./estminster. The Union/ The Secretary of State, Dominions Office, D owning Stre e t, S. A. 1.' ^ tU &gt; sX 2 . The Union Goycninent uonld be much obliged if His majesty's Government in the United Kingdom would favour them with a copy of the Draft Order-in-Cuuncil in question, and the proposed date of issue, together with the necessary particulars about the TreatyvAth Muscat, so as to complete their .reclamation in time to enable them to issue it shortly after or simultaneously with the Order-in-Counci1.

The letter that refers to Article 15 is confidential and will not he published. The question whether the other letters will he published is* under consideration. The Treaty was signed on the 5th February and it is intended to ratify it on the 11th February. 2. he do not thinh it will he possible to make our new Unseat Order-in-Council until about next Kay. The practical reasons rendering it impossible to get this Order out simultaneously with the ratification of the Treaty arc being •*-. explained to the Sultan, who is being asked to agree that our ' coupt in Huscat mhy operate under the old Order for two or three menths bonger. 1ne draft Order-in-Council is being prepared and will have to be sent to the Government of India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. At the same time a copy will oe sent to the Dominions Office for communication to the Union High Commissioner, with an intimation that we do not t ink that any changes that may be made in it as a result of the observations of the Government of India or the Political Resident will be such as to be very material from the point of /tew of the Union Government. As soon as the final draft of the Order-in-Council is ready, we will communicate a copy to the Union Government. It will probably only be possible J.E. Stephenson Esc. , CVO. , OBE. / t0// Dominions Office.to do this ah out the same time as the Or del’ is submitted to the Privy Council and therefore it will he too late to make any alterations then. 4. As regards the High Commissioner’s letter of the loth December 3 it appears that the Union Government agree with the Dominions Office letter of the 14th October except for that part where it was suggested that i.Iuscat might be regarded as standing in a position similar to that of a British protected State. They raise no further objections to the provisions of the Treaty, including the provisions about extraterritorial jurisdiction, nor do they dissent from the view that the discussions at the Imperial Conference of 1937 only related to the exercise of jurisdiction obtained by Treaty and not to tne conclusion of treaties providing for such jurisdiction. Further they admit by implication that in the case of British protected states, including those in the Persian Gulf, we do not have to consult them as regards the terms of our Orders- in-Council or obtain their consent to exercise jurisdiction over Union nationals. They take the view, however, that Muscat stands on a different footing and we admitted that technically it did. Of the two alternative methods of showing that extraterritorial jurisdiction over Union nationals in Muscat would be exercised with the consent of His Majesty’s Government in the Union, which were set out in the Dominions Office letter, they adopt the second and submit a draft proclamation. 5. As regards the draft proclamation, we have the following immediate observations to make, while reserving the right to suggest other minor amendments when our own Order is drafted. 6. In Articles. 2, 3 and 4 the Union Government have inserted in their proclamation matters which in our case would not be dealt with in the Order-in—Council at all because the Tr do notaffect the action of our court. These matters would simply he left on the basis oi 1 the treaty ? and we would suggest that it would he more appropriate and correct that the Union proclamation; the object of which is to sanction the exercise of jurisdiction by our courts over Union nationals? should only deal with matters which actually affect the consular court and that therefore Articles 2? 3 and 4 should be omitted. 7. Article 2 deals with the position in the Sultan's court where we have a treaty right? the substance of which is reproduced in rhis Article. he should claim the observance of this treaty right? but we can?iot enforce it or add to its validity in any way by issuing legislative provisions of our own. S. Similarly? Article :3 deals with the action of the Sultan of Muscat's police and substantially the same comment applies. 9. Article 4 deals with what was an undertaking by both .parties to the Treaty as to the manner in which they will exercise their jurisdiction. It is hardly a provision which can be enacted legislatively in this way and we should not put it in our Order-in-Council. 10. Similar reasoning suggests that in the preamble of the dralt proclamation? the words ''and certain further privileges have also been accorded 1 ' at the end of paragraph 1 should be omitted and that the beginning of paragraph 3 of the* preamble should read 'And whereas it is desirable that Union nationals should be rendered subject to the jurisdiction etc.' 11. In paragraph 2 of the preamble? the penultimate line would? we think? read better if it said ; ‘. . . representatives? over all His Majesty's subjects within the territories of His Highness.'

The original treaty was given a term of twelve years, which was extended at regular intervals afterwards, initially for several years at a time and later on an annual basis.The file concerns the replacement of the existing treaty with a new treaty, following a request from the Sultan of Muscat and Oman [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd] that the two parties enter into negotiations to revise the existing treaty. Matters covered include the following: informal discussions with the Sultan regarding the revision of the existing treaty; the Sultan's reported unwillingness to agree to any further renewals of the treaty in its existing form after 11 February 1938; amendments to the initial draft of the new revised treaty, and the preparation of signature copies, in English and Arabic; the signing and ratifying of the new treaty, on 5 and 7 February 1939 respectively; the extension of the provisions of the treaty to certain British territories.The file features the following principal correspondents: the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Secretary of State for India; the Sultan of Muscat and Oman; officials of the India Office, the Foreign Office, the Dominions Office, the Colonial Office, and the Government of India.In addition to correspondence, the file includes the following: copies of the initial draft of the revised treaty, in English and Arabic (ff 18-53 and ff 54-70 respectively); a signature copy of the draft treaty, in Arabic (ff 100-111); copies of the draft certificate of exchange of ratifications, in English and Arabic (f 177 and ff 179-180).The file's Arabic material consists of the aforementioned copies of the treaty, several items of correspondence, and a transcript of a speech given by the Political Resident on the occasion of the signing of the treaty (English translations are included).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between Great Britain and Muscat (1939)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India and Burma, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Dominions Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><subject><topic>Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between Great Britain and Muscat (1891)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00001f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
