I have just returned from a visit to Xoueit. I had taken over with rue a specimen flag- and printed certificat made up with additions recoi:i tended by ‘ice Admiral Sii Naval Conmander-in-Ohief to X Ceorge Atkinson-B'illes, Foreign Department. Ho: jf , 1453 dated B5rd August 1905. I and discussed them with - ^V — 1 at an inter view wiiichi he had with the -'olitical Af'ent and cxyself on the 7th instant. He readily confirmed acceptance of the certificate, now in printed form, with the exception of item '5 Name of Master*. He explained that this entry would he useless and perhaps misleading as liakhod&amp;s so constantly c uauf e. There is truth in this, and as the other details of the certificate ’'■ill amply identify any vessel, I recom mendreoorar .end 'that; i*t be elininabed as lie siu pe *os. ’•5. As bo the flag, I regret bo say that Sheikh jIob.-,rek would, nob accept it as it stood; i. 8 # ; rith the word ^’ou'cit in the Icoraan as well as the Arabic Character. When the flag was first displayed to him, he forth with asked permission to explain what seamed to him pxie objections to his adopting it and added that if after, them A I were to decide that they were not weighty, he would be prepared to introduce the flag, ^hat he went on to say however amounted to a good deal more than this. old He proceeded to recapitulate all Ms. grievances against the Turks much as he had at ry interview with him -a jf on the subject on ;&gt;a- I UO tXpM X 12 th July last. Be si dent to the lovemiaent of India ho:387 dated 13th Aui ust 1905. par graph 3. In conclusion he said he would adopt the flag as it stood if we would give him a bitten guarantee to protect him from any unpleasant consequences from the Turks which might result to him fromfche use of it. On ray probing his misgivings it became evident that it was the inscription in the Roman Character in which he saw so much difficulty. The nature of this addition and the reasons for it were fully explained to him and he was in formed that it was the Admiral, as a sailor, who had spec ially recommended it in order that it might enable the identity of The Koweit flag? to be readily understood by Belgian Customs officials or other Europeans who could not read the orients,! character. Bly expirations however did not dispel his objections and therefore subject 00 the final views of ‘k)vemment the only thing to do seemed to be to make the best of the flag without •one English inscription, which Sheikh llobarek ad hered to nis previously expressed readiness to adopt. 4 . As the word 'Koweit' has now been eliminated, I have had the letters made a little larger and sub- nit a specimen flag for favour of inspection, together noil the printed certificate as finally accepted by Aueikh: ' ■ ■ 1 I &gt;1 1 lobarek. In the first instance it will I think be advisable to supply the Sheikh gratis uvOtL one dozen Bunting Plag:s 3 C and 500 certificates in two books of £50 each, and if tovemment are pleased to approve of this suggestion I beg that in order to save time, instructions uoi etiier with the respective patterns may issue from the lovernment of India direct to the Ordnance Officer in charge of the Bombay Arsenal and to the Superintendent Jovernment Prinu- ixxg, to supply me with the Articles now asked lor 9 and uo comply with iiiy future indents. 5 . When hwiding them over to Sheikh ' lob v-ejs the Political • Apent •A^fit him know the cost price per flap end book and offer to obtain them for him at taoae prices in future. 6 . There is one aspect of the question of the introduct ion of this flap and certificate which I should not omit in conclusion, to commend to the wise attention of • tavern- mcnt.

It is improbable, however, that the Imperial Government will so far resent the Sheikh’s action as to refuse Koweit dhows carrying the obnoxious flag 'pratique” in Turkish Ports, but if they should do so it will, I think, be incumbent on His Majesty's Go vernment to see that the Sheikh does not suffer following the advice given to him. . Apart from this it seems to me to be in conson ance with our general policy in regard to Koweit that the Sheikh should adopt some special and visible sign of his quasi-independence and I do not know that any better emblem of his peculiar political position than that now proposed could easily be found.

No. 380, datad Koweit, the 30th September 1906. From— CAPTAIN S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to inform you that, at an interview I had with Sheikh Mubarak at the Agency on the 29th instant, I showed him the books and flags forwarded under cover of your No. 2130, dated 14th September 1906. 2. Sheikh Mubarak at once agreed to the issue of the ships’ articles but demurred to the use of the flag which he said was sure to get him into trouble with the Turkish authorities at Basrah. I suggested that it might be possible to fly the flag in the Persian Gulf and Indian waters and to avoid using it in the Shatt-el-Arab, but the Sheikh replied that the Turks would be sure to hear of it and would retaliate by oppressive measures not on the boat that flew the flag but on all Koweit boats indiscrimi nately. 4. In the absence of instructions, I did not feel justified in expressing surprise at his failing to keep his promise made to you to use the flag. Sheikh Mubarak did not show any marked aversion to the new flag but he cited the , .. cases of Abdul Aziz bin Salim bin Badar :* 4 9 -e. sedated sthjanuSy^og! or9ement °* and of the Agent of the_ Firm of Shubaili t Resident to Foreign Department No. 87, dated W ho, he Said, Were Still languishing in r2th February 1905. p. z. c. prison at Koniaf, asking what offence they had committed and receiving no reply. He also mentioned a case of which I had not heard previously when an Agent of Sheikh Mubarak was enlisted and taken to El Hassaand eventually bought a substitute to replace himself. The■ &gt; 2 case seems to have been running for some two years and the Turkish authorities were probably acting legally under the conscription or the matter would have been mentioned before. 5. It was obvious that the inference I was intended to draw was that the Sheikh, though far too polite to say so, felt no confidence in our ability or willingness to protect him or his friends outside Koweit against Turkish intrigues and tyranny. He said that the Belgian trouble was nothing compared to the Turkish. In another discussion, he said that he did not care what went on in Koweit itself, as he could always give an explanation that would satisfy the Tur kish authorities, that what went on outside was what troubled him. With reference to the arms clause in the book, he remarked that the Tur kish authorities refused to allow any boat to carry more than three rifles for self protection, a number that in the Shatt-el-Arab was quite inadequate. 6. It is, I venture to think, probable that Sheikh Mubarak would willingly adopt the flag, provided he received a guarantee that “ His Majesty’s Govern ment would see that the Sheikh does not suffer for following the advice given to him” and I am sure that such a guarantee would improve our relations with the Sheikh to a marked degree.$ The Eight Hon'ble JOHN MORLEY, O.M., His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, n Sir, i' Fort William, the 27 th December 1906 , (1) No. 2416, dated the 14th October 1906, with enclosures. (2) No. 2478, dated the 21st October 1906. V V..e,V We have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with your telegram, dated the 13th June 1906, regarding the adoption by the Sheikh of Koweit of a distinctive flag for his ship ping, and to forward a copy of the marginally-noted letters from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the subject. 2. It is clear from Captain Knox’s report, dated the 30th September 1906* that Sheikh Mubarak is not disposed to adopt the distinctive flag unless he is fortified by an assurance that he will not he permitted to suffer from following the advice given him in this connection by the Political Agent. The grant of such an assurance might, however, involve us in responsibilities of a somewhat extended character, since the opportunities which the Turks enjoy of inflicting injury on the Sheikh and his subjects are by no means con fined to Koweit territory, in respect of which we are already pledged to defend # F^ e his letter to Sir Edward Grey, No. 358, n °te&gt; however, that it Was dated the 23rd May 1906 &gt;, ~. . 4 ^ V recognised'' by Sir N. O’Connor, whose views were apparently accepted by His Majesty’s Government, that in the event of the Sheikh’s accepting our advice, it was incumbent on His Majesty’s Government to see that he did not suffer from the consequences in so far as they depended on the action of the Turkish Government. ^ 3. The position is not devoid of difficulty owing to the suspicions enter tained of our intentions by the Turkish Government, but if the Embassy at Constantinople believe that some means can be found of securing the Koweitis against injury at the hands of the Turkish officials at Basrah and other Turkish ports, we venture to suggest, for the consideration of His Majesty’s Govern ment, that the recognition of this obligation might now unobjectionably be conveyed to Sheikh Mubarak, more especially as from Major Cox’s letter of the 21st October 1906 it appears that the Central Turkish Customs have gone so far as to insist on treating Koweit and even Bahrein as ports of the Turkish Empire,■ « a' ^ / ■ and it may be desirable to take some steps to controvert this action. If, however, His Majesty’s Government are not prepared to give such a guarantee, we propose to direct Captain Knox to take no further steps in the matter.

Sir, have t3ie A honour to achnowledye the receipt of your despatch J'o.nB of the 1st instant, sending me a des patch, with its enclosures, from the Secretary of State for India, respecting the Koweit flag. , I had the honour to report my/view of the ques tion in my despatch ’h. 58, Confidential, of the 2 ra .cay 1006, hut I venture to mate a few additional remarts now oil' the broader aspects of the question. After mature consideration His majesty's ~‘overn- ment entered into a special agreement with the Shaith of Koweit, which , on the one hand, imposed certain restric tions upon him, while, on the other, it impHea more or less a guarantee of protection and the integrity of his territory. The agreement is decidedly of importance as re yards our future negotiations respecting the ifqhgiuq.he of the Baghaaa Railway. It is not formally or officially acknowledged by the Ottoman Government, yet it has weight, with them, ana would influence their course of action und e r c e rt a in c i r c urns t a nc e s. It/ is, mo re ov e r, a difficul ty in the way of the Germans , which I think has alrea.uy accounted in some degree for their desire to come to an understanding wit Any exhibition of us in regard to the Baghdad Pailway. we aline ss on the part of His Llaje sty's Government/ '‘overnment, or of a desire to shir-t the consequence of our agreement with Koweit, would materially affect our position, which is a political factor in the situation which , I venture to thinh, His majesty's ''overnment ouyht not lightly to ignore. As regards the question as to whether the Shaihh of Koweit should be pressed to beep his promise of flying a distinctive flag on Koweit craft, I am in clined to share the opinion of the Political Resident in the Persian hilf. to the effect that we should use great care in the matter, and choose a propitious opportunity for making the suggestion, the more so as, should His Highness act as we urge him to do, I do not see now we can honourably or with credit refuse him protection, ana we may unnecessarily have raised a very troublesome ques tion. re have a. 1 ready marked our connection with Koweit by the appointment by the establishment of a of a Resident, ana, British post office I believe, as we 11 as sunary other ways. I would suggest that the Shaikh should atjfirst fly the new flag in his Konak, or other ''overnment build- ings at Koweit, where we should have no dii.ficulty in ax- fording him protection if the Turkish Government attempted which is very unlikely, to interfere with his action. The Imperial ''overnment will thus, get accustomed to the change and the way will be prepared i.or-its adoption by degrees on the high seas. I havt , etc. (Figned) ' Vh 0 ’ Conor.1. mulish Fla** .

Further discussion surrounds the inscription of 'Koweit' in Roman script as well as Arabic script and the concerns of Shaikh Mobarak over this in the context of strained relations between Persia and Turkey. Shaikh Mobarak requested that Britain guarantee him protection against the Ottomans. The result was the continued use of the Turkish flag with Kuwait inscribed in Arabic letters, to illustrate the Shaikh's 'quasi-independence'. Correspondence discusses the concern of the Ruler of Kuwait over the ability of the British to protect him from the Ottoman Government and the special agreement between the British Government and the Shaikh of Koweit [Kuwait] which imposed certain restrictions on the Shaikh whilst implying a British guarantee of protection of Kuwait's territorial integrity. The correspondence discusses the relative merits of adopting the British flag and the inscription of the Muslim declaration of faith on the flag flown by the Shaikh in front of his palace. Correspondence in 1924 discusses the procedure of flying the flag of Kuwait on HM Ships when receiving a visit from the Shaikh of Kuwait.The principal correspondents in the volume include: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Percy Zachariah Cox; the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Sir Louis Dane; the Political Agent at Kuwait, Stuart George Knox, and later James Carmichael More; the Second Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; Viceroy; the Secretary of State for India, John Morley; the HM Ambassador to Constantinople, Nicholas O'Conor; the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Edward Grey; the Naval Commander in Chief, East Indies Station.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Personal Assistant to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Ṣabāḥ (Family)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Koweit</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial rights</topic></subject><subject><topic>Marine navigation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial administration</topic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial flags</topic></subject><subject><topic>Flags</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000008#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
