HARRIS, Under Secretary to the Government of India.\ No. 35-Public (Records), dated the 5th December 1902. p rom The Right Honourable Lord George Francis Hamilton, His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, Tq Hi s Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My attention has been drawn to a want of consistency in the spelling and T arrangement of native Indian names in 0f nat,Te I “ d ' a,1 the “india List” compiled in this office. These anomalies affect (1) the transliteration and (2) the alphabetical arrange ment of the names in the Record of Services and m the Honours List at pages 151-168. , . , . 2 On examining the matter, I find that the same blemishes occur m t e original sources, the “ Histories of Services ” published by the various Local Governments and Administrations in India, from which the materials for t India List are derived. The compilers are compelled to rely upon these for the proper rendering of the vernacular names, as this office is not, as Your Excel lency is aware, provided with a vernacular Department.; and it is evidently necessarv that the names should be represented in the India List in the same form as is used in the official publications current in India. 3 With regard to transliteration, it appears that great diversity of system (notwithstanding the endeavours made some thirty years ago to introduce uniformity) prevails in some of the Provincial Histones of Services. The Bengal History is especially inaccurate and inconsistent m its spelmgs. find^for instance, both Amir and Ameer ; Moulvie, Maulvi ’ ai J d A/ ? I 1 ou V V Syed, Syad, Sayed, Syud, and Saiyid; Mahmad, Mahamad, Mahamed, Mahomed, Mohamed, Mohammed—six different forms, and all incorrect for the name pio- perly transliterated Muhammad. In fact, the names and titles of Muhamma ans in general appear to be more often wrongly, than correctly spelt in t ns compilation. There is the same inconsistency 111 IIind ^ Bengali surnames are variously represented:^., Dutt, Dutta, Datta, Mittra, Mitra, Mitter ; Bhattacharjee, .Bhattacharya, Bhuttacharjee, Bhuttachar]i, Bhattacharja ; Ghose, Ghosh; Sing, Singh, Smgha, Sinha; Chaudhun, CIkw d y, Chowdry ; etc. It is needless to multiply examples turther. 4 Many of these inconsistencies are probably due to differences in the practice observed by the bearers in writing their names in the Roman character and no doubt in the past great latitude has been allowed in this respect. But I would ask Your Excellency to consider whether some endeavour might not now be made to promote greater uniformity in the practice of Government publi cations. If an example of systematic spelling is set m Government publica tions it may be anticipated that it will be generally followed, at any rate by servants of Government; and I believe that since the adoption of systematic spellin'* several years ago in the Army List, no difficulty has been found in enforcing its observance in that branch of the public service. 5. The second point on which a want of uniformity prevails is the treat ment, for the purposes of alphabetical arrangement, of the surnames used in some parts of India, chiefly by Hindus. The use o surnames is common in Lower Bengal and Assam, but does not prevail in Bihar , it is unknown in ^ c United Provinces and the Punjab, and in the Central Provinces except for Mahratta names ; in Bombay also it appears to he restricted to certain classes of the population. In Madras the practice appears to vary, surnames being used by some classes &lt;jf Hindus, and not by others. Throughout India Muhammadans generally do not appear to use surnames. On referring to the Histones of Services; I find that in Bengal, where the names in the different departments are arranged in alphabetical order, the order in the case of all natives whe ner possessing surnames or not, is that of the first name, not as in that of Europe ans ©f the surname. In other histories the names are not arranged alphabeti- cally in the body of the book ; but in the Madras list I observe that in theindex no account appears to be taken of the surname, the order being that of tbe personal name. In Bombay, on the other hand, the index arranges tne names according to the surname where one is used ; but where tbe quasi surname is only the father’s name (as in Gujarati and other non-Mahratta Hindu names),*the order is that of the personal name. In provinces where there are no surnames in use, the order in the index is necessarily that of the personal names. 6. It appears to me desirable that some consistent system should be laid down for observance; and I would suggest that it might be well to appoint a small Committee, including one or two native gentlemen, to consider and report on the subject. Where surnames are in use, it would seem possible to recognise them, but to provide by means of cross-references in the index or alphabetical list against any difficulty in finding a name which may be also current in the ^ personal form. In future this practice will be adopted in compiling the India List in this office. G. I. C, P. 0 .—No. 4252 F. D.* 23 - 2 - 1906 .- 250 .-P, M. XI.Nos. 1450—1457. From R.

In the letter from this Department, nos. 1416—1425, dated the 25th March 1903, the question was referred for the consideration of the local Governments whether it is not desirable to require a closer approach to uniformity, first in the spelling of all Indian native names in official lists and correspondence, and secondly, in the treatment of surnames for the purpose of the alphabetical arrangement of the Histories of Services, the indexes of the Civil Lists, etc. The Government of India have now examined the subject in the light of the opinions expressed by the local Governments and have arrived at the following conclusions. 3. There is a general consensus of opinion that a uniform system of spelling is both practicable and desirable, and the Government of India are fully in accord with this view. They consider that each name should be spelled as commonly written and pronounced by an educated native when writing and speaking the Vernacular . If this principle beconsistently followed, it will avoid, on the one hand, the use of Sanskritised versions, such as Mukhopadhyaya for Mukarji, and on the other hand, the use of Anglicised forms, such as Bonnerjee for Banarji ancTRoy or Ray for Rai. In transliterating, the rules prescribed in the circular from the Government of India, nos. dated the 17th October 1872, should be followed, and a reprint of the table containing those rules is forwarded for convenience of reference. The attention of the local Governmentis invited to tlie note for guidance in using the table which has been inserted at its foot. The table applies to the Perso-Arabic and Devanagari characters only ; but it can he readily adapted to the use of Bengali, Punjabi, and other scripts of Indo-Aryan origin, and it will serve as a useful guide in the case of other languages. In applying the rules the most important point to bear in mind is, that the vowel sounds given in the sixth column of the table should invariably he represented as in the fifth column. To this rule only two exceptions are admissible. If in any language the short e of “ get ” and the short o of “ on ” (two sounds which are unknown to the languages of Northern India) are used, they should be represented by the unaccented e and o; the vowel sounds in “ grey *’ and “ pole ” then being represented by the accented 6 and 6 respec tively. In transliterating the consonants, c and q must not be used; nor should diacritical marks be employed. 4. The second question, whether the personal name, or the surname, when a surname is used, should form the basis of alphabetical order in official lists is a question of some difficulty. The practice of the local Governments varies considerably, and were the Civil List and Histories of Services alone in ques tion, the Governor General in Council would be inclined to leave the solution to the discretion of each local Government. But the India Office List, which collates the information given in the various provincial lists, must be prepared on a uniform basis, and this renders it essential that the provincial lists should themselves be constructed in a uniform manner. The Government of India consider that it will he best to adopt the system suggested by His Majesty’s Secretary of State in his despatch no. 35-Public (Records), dated the 5th Decem ber 1902, a copy of which was forwarded with the Home Department letter of the 25th March 1903. Under this system priority will be given to the surname and provision will be made by means of cross references in the index or alphabetical list against any difficulty in finding a name which may also be current in the personal form. Generic names (wherever they exist) but not titles should be treated as surnames, and where there are no generic names, the first distinctive personal name should be used as the index word. The manner in which the rule should be worked is illustrated and explained by the specimen table which forms the second enclosure to this letter and the instructions which are printed under it. The table is printed in three columns marked A, B, and C. In a book (such as the History of Services or the India List) of which the entries are arranged alphabetically, they would follow the order of column A, cross-references being given as in column B. In a graded list, for instance, where the order is other than alphabetical, the full names would be given as used, as in column C. The indexes to both would consist of the entries in columns A and B combined in alphabetical order. 5. It remains to consider the steps which should now be taken to secure uniformity on the principles enunciated in the above paragraphs. The Govern ment of India consider that the most convenient course will be for each local Government to prepare and submit to them a list of all the varnacular names which appear in the Provincial Civil List for the ctirrent quarter, the list being prepared on the model of the specimen statement alluded to in paragraph 4 above. When all the lists have been received, they will be compared and scrutinised and general orders will be issued on them. In preparing the lists local Governments may, at their discretion, omit names belonging to persons foreign to the province, since, ordinarily, the spelling and arrangement which obtain in the province of origin should be followed. But cases probably exist in which names brought from outside have acquired a local spelling and pronun ciation, or in which special names have become customary among immigrants of foreign descent who have settled in the province ; and in these cases local usage should be recognised.

Calcutta, the 30th November 1905. RESOLUTION. The question of prescribing greater uniformity of treatment in the spelling and arrangement of Indian personal names in official publications has recently received the careful consideration of the Government of India. 1 heir action in the matter is the natural sequel of the discussion of somewhat similar Questions in the past. In 1872 rules were laid down for the transliteration ot names of places, and lists were prepared, which were revised in 1900. A nroposal was made as early as 1875 to adopt a systematic spelling of personal names in the Army List, hut no steps were taken to carry this out for some Years and U was not till 1884 that a hand-book by Mr. (now Sir) C. J. Lyall Vas published under the title ‘ Guide to the transliteration of Hindu and Muhammadan names in the Bengal Army.’ Subsequently, a manual of Hindu names peculiar to the Madras Presidency was prepared. Burmese names are transliterated according to a special system and need not be referred to here. 2 Although the adoption of a uniform system in the case of the names of places has affected to some extent the transliteration of personal names, neither this nor the publication of corrected lists of names entered in the Army List has . been found in practice to be sufficient to secure reasonable uniformity in the cnnllino- of the large number of -personal names which are identical or closely similar 5 in form. ~ Further anomalies and diversities arise in the process ot derterminino- what portions of certain names should be treated as surnames for the purposes of official publications. The result has been that the spelling and the arrangement of names in civil lists and histories of services are inconsistent and confusing. These defects are reproduced in the India List, which is compiled in England from the provincial histories of services. As this work deals with the whole of India and is frequently consulted by persons who are not familiar with Indian vernacular names or languages, it must be prepared on uniform principles. 3 On these ^rounds local Governments were invited to consider the *»dvisabilitv of introducing in official publical ions a closer approach to uniformity iioth in the matter of spelling and as regards the recognition of certain classes of names as virtually equivalent to surnames. Their replies indicated a general consensus of opinion that a uniform system ol spelling was both practicable and desirable, and with this view the Government of India were thoroughly in ncoord The treatment of surnames presented more difficulty, as it was doubtful whether certain appellations should be treated as surnames, ami whether in the indices priority should be given to personal names or to surnames, in order to obtain material for a decision on the general questions raised, local Governments were asked to prepare a list of all vernacular names m their current civil lists showing the arrangement of each name m full and the system on which it should be shown in the index. 4 The complete lists have been received and examined by the Government Cf India and it is now possible to issue general orders on the subject. The final decision’hasbeengreatly-facilitatedhy the careful manner in which the lists have been prepared, especially those sent up by the Governments of Bengal f where the question was considered by a special committee of which the Jlr. Hon’hle Mr. J ustice Mukharji was a member), Madras and the Lmted Pro- vinces. 5 To take the question of surnames first, it seems to the Government of India that the use of these is fully established in Bengal and Assam and in the2 case of most Hindu names in Madras and Bombay. In other parts of India the practice is less clearly defined. The generic appellations affixed to individual names differ m origin, being sometimes sectarian or territorial in character and sometimes referring to distinctions of caste or tribe. To their treatment as surnames the objection has been^taken that they do not form an essential part ot an individual’s designation and are not invariably used in signatures ; while m so far as they denote membership of a religious sect it is argued that they cannot be regarded as distinctive of particular persons. Apart, however, from the question whether these appellations really represent surnames in the European sense, the Government of India are. satisfied that in most provinces their use is frequent enough to justify their treatment as surnames for the purposes of civil lists and similar publications. Whether priority should be suven to them in indexing depends on local usage. Thus in Madras, where almost every Hindu uses a name of this sort, and the names are invariably known, they should be employed as the main entries. Where, on the other hand, as is the case in the United Provinces, they are used less frequently and aa-e not.commonly known, the personal name should form the principal entry in the index, but the caste name or title used should also be indexed, with a cross reference to the personal name. w* T, 1 1P . ( l ue8 ^ 0n of spelling is complicated by various linguistic and phone me difficulties and no single criterion can be entirely relied upon as conclusive 1 here are many cases in which the pronunciation differs from the written form* and the combined lists have shown that the same name may be spelt in half a dozen different ways. To prescribe absolute uniformity of spellin 0, for all Hindu names of ideutieal or cognate origin would conflict too sharply with popular usage, but in revising the lists prepared by local Governments it has been found possible to reduce the variant forms in‘each case to two or three for the whole of India. In the case of Muhammadan names, which have been less altected by dialectic changes, consistent methods of transliteration are clearlv appropriate. J 7. Such are the general principles which the Governor General in Council nas decided to adopt in dealing with this intricate question. Their application • m deta! 1 wiH be expiamed separately to local Governments in letters dealino- with the several lists of vernacular names submitted, and so far as the official treatment of all names occurring in such lists is concerned, the Government of India think it important that no deviations from the standard form should be admitted. In concludon the Government of India would remind local Govern ments that the question of securing a reasonable degree of uniformity in the treatment of native personal names is of wider import and larger interest than tbe mere convenience of persons who have occasion to refer to official lists It is highly desirable on all grounds that incorrect, variable, and debased spellings should disappear from written usage throughout India in favour of accurate and consistent forms. The present orders relate only to a special and limited class ot publications, but the Government of India hope that local Governments will endeavour to extend the standard forms of spelling now prescribed to all classes of official documents. They would be glad also to see the influence of nigh judicial authorities throughout India exerted in the direction of givim* wider effect to the reforms now instituted. Native usage in these matters is naturally conservative, and there will doubtless be a tendency for private individuals to ao.here to some of the inaccurate variants now current, but the success which lias attended the standard system of transliteration for place names encourages the Government of India to hope that the example of a system of spelling calculated to preserve the historical character and associations of Indian personal names will in course of time commend itself to the feelings of the people.

It appears to the Government of India that the practice in Bombay of writing personal names composed of two distinct words as though they were one should be assimilated to that prevailing in other parts of India, by which the separate portions of the name are separately written. Thus instead of Gopalshankar should be used the form Gopal Shankar, and instead of Abdullahkhan, Abdullah Khan, and so on. 3. In certain respects theTist does not appear to have been examined with scrupulous care. Accents are not used in a uniform manner, even on the same names ; a comma is sometimes inserted after a word which is not a surname, e.g., nos. 224, 408, 720, etc., judging by the entries in column C which purport to give the name in full; cross-references have been given in the. ease of nos. 93—4, 149, 251, etc., while there are none for the majority of Parsi names. The following cases have been noticed in which various spellings are. used for what are apparently the same names.

SlU, Calcutta t the 23rd March 1906. In continuation of paragraph 7 of the Home Department resolution no. 3842—74 (Public), dated the 30th November 1905, l am directed to com municate the following remarks regarding the list of native names cunent in Bengal which was submitted with your letter no. 1350-A., dated the 22nd February 1905. 2. The Government of India have already acknowledged the caie with which the question has been treated in Bengal, and they have but few comments tp offer upon the revised proposals of the local Government. 3. They accept the spelling of Muhammadan names which the Bengal Government has adopted as generally correct, hut a few discrepancies and inaccuracies have been noted. In the case of words compounded with the Arabic article the Government of India would prefer to write the several consti tuents separately, e.g .— Nur-ud-din not Nuruddin, Nazir-ul-Hakk not Nazirul Hak. To this rule, they w r ould, however, make an exception in the case of the name Abdullah, and also of all names compounded with Abd or Ab. These have been correctly written— Abdul Hamid, Abdur Rahman, Abul Hasan, etc. Other names compounded with ‘ ullah ’ should be written as follows . Ahmad-ullah, Iradat-ullah, etc. The use of a capital letter in the final term of compounds with the Arabic article will depend on whether it is or is not an attribute of Deity : thus— Kutb-ud-din, Mohi-ud-din, etc., but Aziz-ur-Rahman, Abdus Samad. The Government of India would also prefer to write Hakk, not Hak : they observe that the final triliteral has been correctly retained in the analogous case Abur Rabb.‘ 4. The case of Hindu names presents far more difficulty. As already indicated the Government of India have decided to enforce the spellings Basu, Bhattacharii, Chatarji, Chakrabatti, Das, De, Datta, Ghosh, Kumar, Misra, Mitra Mallik, Mukharji, Sarbadhikari, which may be taken as some ot the commonest names which are at present very variously spelled But m some of these cases at least where a variant spelling (Bose, Dey, Dutt, Ghose, etc.) is firmly established it will be necessary to make free use of cross-references.2 5. As regards the treatment of personal names difficulties arise in the case of such letters as w, v, b and o, j and y, sh and s, etc. The Government of India propose that these cases should be settled as follows :— {a) B should he used in all cases in Bengal save in conjuncts where w should be used :— Thus:— Shibdas, Shibdeb, Shibnarain, Brahmadeb, Mahadeb, Bhabani, etc., but Jwala, Dwarka. (&amp;) J - should be preferred to y in such names as Jogesh, Jadu, Suraj, Ajodhya, Jotendra, Jogendra, Jugal and Gyanada and Gyanendra should be used instead of Jnanada and Jnanendra ; {c) sh should he preferred to s in Kishor, Ashutosh, etc. But the Gov ernment of India have decided to adopt the form Sri universally in preference to Shri; (d) where k is combined with sh it should he retained in Bengal, e.g., Lakshman, Kshetra, Akshay; (e) y should he preferred to i in terminations, e.g., Akshay, Bay, Sahay, Uday; (/) In the case of the termination -eswar, eshvar, -eshar, etc., the spelling -eswar should be universally retained, as proposed by the Committee appointed by the local Government to consider the subject. Subject to these observations, which do not claim to be exhaustive, the Government of India approve of the revised spellings proposed in the revised list annexed to your letter.

SIR, X With reference to paragraph 7 of the Home Department resolution no 3842—74 (Public), dated the 30th November 1905, I am directed to com municate the following remarks regarding the list of names forwarded with the late Mr. Impey’s letter no. 2b8, dated the 17th and 28th February 1905. 2 The Government of India recognise that the use of generic appellations as surnames is probably less fully established in the United Provinces than in other parts of India. At the same time they believe that such usage is increas ing with the spread of English education, and they desire that in cases where such names are widely known they should be treated as surnames in official publications. Where, however, they are not generally recognised the personal name should form the main entry in the index in the manner presenbed m paragraph 5 of the recent resolution. The Government of India also desire that no exceptions may be made to the general rule that a correct transliteration should be followed, and I am to say that the spelling of the names quoted at the end of Mr. Impey’s letter should be accordingly corrected. 3. The list submitted by the Government of the United Provinces appears to the Government of India to have been carefully prepared and they have but few criticisms to offer. It is noticed, however, that in a few cases colloquial spellings have been used where ordinary usage in other parts of India recognises more polished forms. In order to reduce the number of variant forms, the Government of India consider that the following spellings should be‘adopted for those employed in the list:— Read For Rab Read For Biri Hak . Rabb. .. Brij. . Hakk. . Mathura. . Misra. . Narayan. . Prakash. . Prasad. Raghbans Raghbar Rughbir Mathra . Misr Naiain . Parkash Parshad . Raglmnath, . Raghura j. H aghnath Ragkraj 4. The method to be followed in the case of Bengali names will be sufficiently clear from the enclosed copy of a letter no. 728, dated 23id March 1906, which has been addressed to the Government of Beugal upon the subject together with a copy of the revised list of names submitted by that Govci n- • ment.

Sir, In continuation of paragraph 7 of the Home Department resolution n0 3342—74 (Public), dated the 30th November 1905, I am directed to com- miinicate the following remarks regarding the list received with your letter no. 1831, dated the 19th December 1904. 2 The examination of the list has been rendered difficult by -the fact that it has* not been corrected with sufficient care, misprints being indeed sometimes so frequent as to make it uncertain what spelling is recommended for adoption. Thus the same name appears in the three columns of the list as Harkhishan, Harkishen, and Harkishan. In the following cases in which variant spellings of the same name have been admitted, these should be replaced by the single corrected form now shown against them: For Kishan • • • Read ■) Krishan . • * &gt; Kishan. Krishna • . Kishen • • J Sheo • • • Shib • • 1 . ^Sheo. Shiva • Shiv (even Shiv-Dew) . 1 J Siv • . Gobind • . ' 'I Gobind. Govind . . . J For Lachhman Lakshman Lachhmi Lakhmi Lakshmi Raghbar Raghubar Ragbunath Ragnath Ragunath Read Lachhman. Lachhmi, Raghubar. j Raghunath. 3. Corrections are also required in the following names. In many cases the alteration has been made in order to correct some mistake of transliteration, but in other cases where the list possibly represents spellings in actual use they have been determined upon with the intention of reducing the number of variant spellings current in India.

In paragraph 5 of that letter it was enjoyed that the Hunterian system of spelling which was adopted in 1872 should be strictly observed, and the rules for transliteration then prescribed were again circulated to local Governments. I am now to say that the Government of India have decided to modify those rules in regard to two points, namely, (a) the leter (f qaf should be represented in transliteration by Q and ( ) 3:1:1 m******9*+ K should be used to represent the letter a In .

I therefore request primarily that you will be very eareful to avoid the spelling of names variously in the same letter or correspondence and secondly, that you will be generally guided in the spelling . of names of places by Hunter’s map and the transliteration system employed in Volume II of the Persian culf gazetteer, which system should also be your guide to the spelling of titles \ and names of people. 2. An exception should I think be made for the case of names of places served by the Indian Postal Department, the spelling of which should be that adopted by the Postal authorities for postmarking letters. 3. In order to assist your clerks to keep to a uniform spell ing I would suggest that you compile from the Gazetteer or on - the basis of the Gazetteer system, as complete a list as pract icable, of the places ordinarily figuring in your reports, and of the ordinary vernacular names, and have it hung up in your office for reference. I havePlease see Residency letter NO 2337 d/ the 31st August 1910 re spelling of names* Of course printers would he much trouhlet by various spelling of |i±x names of places and persons in the same correspondence. Him- te^s map I believe refers only to India and not to foreign countries. There will be no 'trouble in our spelling names of Indian town as we can always spell according to the Postal Aljihabetical list but the difficulty will be about proper names. For instance the name of the Arabian prophet is spelled variously viz ,l Mohommed ,1 n Muhammed H and ”Mohomed ,, . Our town ij variously spelled viz by Post office /t ,t Muscat ,, , by the Navy Masqat' and in the Civil Account code Appendix D where names of Indian Treasuries are given it is spelled as'Muskat' Volume I beleive II of the Persian Gulf Gazetteer has been received by the last mail.*A0. or ion, British Be s id ere/ and Consulate-General, :ushire, 10-h September 1911, To T.13 POLITICAL AGEOT &amp; H.M's C OK SUL, 10JSCAT.

The following List of Names in Persia applies to the southern pro\inces only, viz. Luristan, Khuzistan (formerly ‘Arabistan), Bakhtiari, Isfahan, Yezd, Pars, Laristan, Kerman, Seistan, Persian Baluchistan, and Makran. The boundaries of the provinces are for the most part indefinite. For financial purposes the Bakhtiari country is united with Khuzistan, Laristan with Pars, Persian Baluchistan and Makran with Kerman. M ith every name are given the approximate distance and bearing from the best-known town in the province in which the place is believed to be situated ; these are, respectively, Khurramabad, Mohammerah, Chigha Khur, Isfahan, Yezd, Bushire, Bandar ‘Abbas, Kerman, Nasratabad, Bampur, and Task. Persian orthography is by no means fixed and consistent, and especially is there uncertainty about the identity and length of many vowels. The termination -an is often pronounced -un; v between kh and a is mute. The P.C.G.N. usually discourages the use of hyphens, but allows them with the particle -i-, generally called Izafat or the Kasra of Relationship, which comes between a substantive and its possessor or attribute. M hen the substantive ends in -a or -u, it is followed by yi and not -i-. Some times the attribute precedes the substantive, and then the Izafat is not used : e.g. Kuh-i-Slah or Slab Kuh = Black Mountain. It may be noted that the termination -abad, meaning an inhabited place, is properly a separate word in Persian; but it has long been customary in transliteration to incorporate it with the rest of the name. Many other compound names are similarly treated. The word Bandar, meaning a port, which precedes the names of many coastal villages, is often omitted, but should be retained in the case of the well-known name Bandar ‘Abbas.
