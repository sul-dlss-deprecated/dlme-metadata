Telegrams s “ DETHONOUR,” RICHMOND, SURREY 3rd July, 1945, Dear Si^, I am sure that you and all those good friends who have given such generous aid to our annual Remembrance Day Appeal on November 11th will be interested and glad to know that Poppy Day 1944 although not reaching the Target of ONE MILLION POUNDS for which we aimed has, nevertheless, created a new high record. The total so far received - £971,768. - is not the final one as there are still a few overseas collections to come in, but it is nearly £4,000 more than was given in 1943. On the day itself we were somewhat pessimistic about our chances of beating previous records. For one thing the weather here was very bad. Worse still, London and the Home Counties were suffering rather badly from flying bombs. / To reach a new record under such adverse conditions was therefore most pleasing to us all, but we know how very much we were helped by our friends overseas. Their gifts alone totalled £87,532, and our very real gratitude goes out to you all for such sterling support to our work. As to this work, it has grown very rapidly during the past year. There is still a very great deal we have to do for the veterans of 1914-18, but most of our work now is naturally for men and women of the present ?;ar - ex-Sailors, Soldiers, Airmen, Merchant Seamen and Members of the Auxiliary Women’s Services and their families, and the dependants of those grand men who have made the supreme sacrifice. The total number of present war cases we have already been able to help now exceeds 140,000. These have been cases of men and women who have been discharged from the Services on account of sickness or dis ablement. Now that demobilisation has started, our real task begins, and during the next three or four years, and this is only to mention what must be a minimum period, it is quite clear that our annual expenditure will far exceed current income, and that we shall have to draw quite heavily on our comparatively small Reserve Fund, and this Reserve Fund itself must be increased as much as possible for the time when we have defeated Japan. We want to keep all Legion schemes of assistance in full operation. Some very brief details of these varied schemes are given in the enclosed leaflet. Some schemes our Council are anxious to extend very considerably, finances permitting. Of these I might mention the ti- 2 - © V Housing Plan for disabled married men, our Pensions Fund for prematurely aged ex-Service men and our two fine Sanatoria - Preston Hail and Nayland Hall - for ex-Service men and women. Last year many of you gave sympathetic consideration to and acted upon our suggestion of arranging special functions throughout 'Remem brance Week' (this year November 5th to 11th) and I am taking the liberty of enclosing a leaflet on this subject and do so hope many more of you may be able to arrange something on these lines, or an extra event or two? We are most hopeful that this year - 1945 'Victory Year' - will not only see the Million total for Poppy Day passed for the first time, but passed by a very substantial margin, and I feel sure that all our friends abroad, particularly in - BAHRAIN - will again play their generous and most valuable part in this world-wide Appeal on behalf of ex-Service men and women. the p.S. I do so hope that Poppies you permitted us to send in January have reached you safely and that all your arrangements are going forward satisfactorily and that this letter will, if published near to November 11th, help your 1945 collection.

There are probably many people who have found a new interest during the war years in organising events such as those mentioned on behalf of other organisations whose activities are now coming to an end, and Poppy Day Committees might well consider whether the co-operation of such people could not be sought for the benefit of British Legion funds to assist ex-service men and women. /A -Win you please give this matter your early and careful thought this year. There is no doubt that when demobilisation starts in earnest we shall have more calls on our benevolent funds than ever before. AUCTIONS OF POPPIES DANCING DISPLAYS CONCERTS ★ ★ ★ In gratitude for Services given MAKE * VICTORY YEAR’ THE BEST EVERREMEMBRANCE WEEK IN AID OF HAIG'S FUND The idea of holding a Remembrance Week to augment Poppy Day collections is now becoming firmly established, and an increasing number of districts were last year most successful in the organisation of these special efforts. Many organisers reported that owing to their success in t&gt;^\ direction they were able to send us larger remittances than in previo^ years. In some cases very much larger, despite the very bad weather which was experienced on the day of the sale of Poppies. It is our earnest hope that even more Poppy Day Committees can include these activities in their organisation, and it should again be stressed that we do not ask the Committee to carry out these arrangements in addition to their Poppy Day work, but rather that they should seek the support of other bodies in their district who could thus relieve them of the additional tasks involved in these extra events. The X district referred to in our 1944 leaflet was again able to report a substantial increase in its collection, due entirely to the support given to the special appeals—the sale of Poppies was very seriously interfered with by bad weather on November 11th—and the organiser of this district again refers to the keen interest of everyone in the neighbourhood. British Legion Branches will be interested to know that the support given to Legion work generally is very much increased because of the opportunities that have been found to let the general public know what we are able to do for the ex-service community. ^ In 1945 November 11th falls on a Sunday, and therefore the street collections are to be made throughout the country on Saturday, November 10th, whilst the Remembrance Services will, according to the usual procedure, be held on Sunday, November 11th. For this reason the programme should be arranged on rather different lines, perhaps something like the following :— Monday Nov. 5th - WHIST DRIVE and/or DANCE Tuesday 6th - JUMBLE SALE and/or SCHOOL EFFORTS Wednesday- M 7th - PRODUCE OR GIFT SALE, CONCERT Thursday - M 8th - DANCE and/or WHIST DRIVE Friday ft 9th - HOUSE TO HOUSE COLLECTIONS—SOCIALS Saturday - ft 10th - STREET AND HOUSE TO HOUSE COLLECTIONS Sunday tf 11th - REMEMBRANCE SUNDAY CHURCH COLLECTIONS0 ■' The items mentioned are all well-proved sources of revenue, but 'no-one will need to be reminded that there are many other ways in which contributions to our funds can be obtained, and perhaps a repetition of the list we have previously given will serve as a reminder.

This i s \ therefore, my farewell letter* to you, and I would wish to take the opportunity of expressing to you personally wy deep gratitude for the great, and in many cases very long, support you have always given me. I have realised throughout my long period of service that fhe success of Poppy Day has depended above all else on your loyal and enthusiastic local efforts. May T now say a very sincere Thank you and gl^e you at the same time my very best wishes for the future. At this moment, as I hand over to my successor, our Statement of Account for Poppy Day 1945 - still not quite closed - shows that we have decisively surpassed our 1944 effort and are very close indeed to the elusive £1,000,000. (By the time you receive this letter you may have already heard of the attainment of this total.) To my mind this announcement is in itself the finest and most fitting tribute which I can pay to you - the individual Orgeniser - and to the voluntary Poppy Day organisation throughout the world, upon which I have leaned so heavily over the years. The Earl^Haig British Legion Appeal owes you a debt which it can never repay. May I now introduce my successor to you. Some few of you will already know of him He is Captain B. H. R.

People g^nerolly are not now earning as much as they were during the war ano unless considerably and suitably encouraged will not in future */ive as rmicn for their Poppies as they did during the war. The SkoOND FACTOR is the passing of the natural and spontaneous war-time desire to give whole-hearted support to the Services. Given t'me we can find the answer to these two unfavourable factors. We have time if we set about it now. Please do not hesitate to ask us to share your local tasks - in so far as it is practicable - with you. It occurs to me that the enclosed 'Guide to Organisers' (intended firstly for our home Organisers) whilst by no means '-^wholly applicable to your local overseas conditions, may yet be of definite assistance to you. Many of the features of Poppy Day and Remembrance Week outlined in the 'Guide' have been adopted by you in the past. I feel perhaps that if you will kindly read this pamphlet - adapting the coni-ents where necessary to your local conditions - it may help you to develop your own Appeal. Tn the coming weeks I am intending to supplement this letter and the 'Guide to Organisers' by sending you a special Overseas News Bulletin giving you interesting and up-to-date information about the work of the Legion - information which should be useful to you as publicity material for Poppy Day. May I thank those Organisers who have already replied to our March letter promising their co-operation and sending in their order's ^ and request those of you who have not, so far been able t o ^ do so to gnve immeoiate eno sympathetic attention to the matter ? There are quite a. number of you from whom we have not yet heard. You will, I know, appreciate that shipping is still difficult and transport delays frequent. If we are to get your supplies to you punctually for next Remembrance Day there Is no time to be lost. Prior to the outbreak of the 1939/45 war, the British Legion, backed by Earl Haig’s Fund, had built up a welfare organisation second to none. Our task now is to ensure, by our efforts throughout this Country and Overseas, such an income that our future welfare organisation may match the new and greatly increased demands now being m*de upon it. I have every confidence that, with your continued support, we shall achieve this aim. May I offer you my very best wishes and all good luck for Poppy Day 1946. Yours sincerely, B. H. R.

HOUSE-TO-HOUSE COLLECTIONS. There are still many districts in which poppies are sold only in the streets. This is a pity. It means such a loss to the British Legion and the men it serves. On any average November day at least nine million people do not go out of doors. They include housewives, elderly and sick people, domestic workers, children under school age, retired and independent people, and many others. If the weather is bad, then the number may be even greater. It is far too valuable a field to be missed, and we hope that organised House- to-House Collections will form part of the Poppy Day arrangements this year in all districts. Volunteers for this work can, of course, make their House-to-House calls on any of the days immediately before November 11th, although the actual anniversary is likely to prove the most productive. REMEMBRANCE SUNDAY COLLECTIONS. The importance of these Collections cannot be too strongly emphasised. Really wonderful support has been given us for many years by Ministers and Congregations of all Denominations. Last year (1945) Church Collections reached the new high record of £50,000 and once again we acknowledge with a deep sense of gratitude the generosity of these good and staunch friends who not only give liberally to these Collections on the Sunday, but give again when they buy their poppies. There is no reason why we should not hope for an even higher revenue from the Churches this year. It should be possible if Organisers make sure to contact all Ministers in their districts well in advance of Remembrance Sunday (this year November 10th) to ask them to devote their Remembrance Sunday Collections to the Fund. It is still, unfortunately, impracticable to send a direct postal appeal to Ministers from Poppy Day Headquarters as was our practice before the War. This makes local contact of even greater value. An important point to emphasise is that all Collections, unless it is wished otherwise, are used by the Legion to relieve distress amongst3 ex-Service men and women and their families in the actual districts in which the money is contributed. COLLECTIONS IN FACTORIES, OFFICES, SCHOOLS, ETC. Every effort should be made to obtain the co-operation of the managements of Factories, offices, etc., as well as Head Teachers of Schools, in permitting, or better still, in making their own arrangements for organised sales of poppies amongst workpeople and school children. Employers should also be asked to encourage their female workers to volunteer to sell poppies, and to allow them leave of absence for this purpose. REMEMBRANCE WEEK. This is proving an increasingly valuable scheme for adding to the income from poppy sales. A record number of districts included Remembrance Week in their scheme of organisation in 1945. The results in all cases were valuable. In many, they were quite spectacular. They proved again our theory that the Remembrance Week idea, in many districts, can produce as much again as a well organised sale of poppies. Perhaps we might remind Organisers, briefly, that the idea of Remembrance Week is to arrange daily events, concerts, entertainments of a varied nature, preferably during the week ending November 11th, or if impracticable the week after. All these events of course will be in aid of the Poppy Day Fund. Nothing elaborate or complicated is necessary. There are so many simple and well- tried schemes which can be organised to advantage. A quick glance through some Poppy Day statistics for 1945 shows that considerable sums were raised by Organisers during Remembrance Week by such simple means as— Bring and Buy Sales Concerts—Whist Drives Mile of Pennies Rummage Sales Market Auctions Dances Darts Competitions Band Concerts Bridge and Whist Drives Raffles Dog and Cat Shows Amateur Dramatic Shows Sales of Fruit and other Produce Football Matches Theatre and Cinema Collections Sale of Motor Car Tombola4 Bring and Buy Sales appeared to be the most productive. Many brought in more than ,£100. One, in fact, produced £505, another £343. These figures speak for themselves. It is not suggested that Organisers should be personally responsible for the different events or entertainments. They will, in mpst cases, be sufficiently occupied in handling the main appeal by the sale of poppies. Experience has shown, however, that there should be little difficulty in persuading other associations or individuals each to be responsible for organising one event to form part of the programme for the whole week. The possibilities of Remembrance Week are, naturally, greater in Rural and semi-Rural Districts where for the main part residents have to create their own amusements. Nevertheless, a very good deal can be done in this direction, and to great advantage, even in the largest cities and towns. The Bring and Buy Sale already mentioned which produced £505 was organised in a Yorkshire manufacturing town with a population of 28,000. SALES OF POPPY WREATHS. In 1945 we sold 58,000 Poppy Wreaths, a new record, but this year we are aiming for a still higher total. We feel sure that Poppy Day Committees and Organisers will gladly renew the valuable help they have given in past years and to those districts in which the necessary arrangements can be made we shall be glad to send a selection of Wreaths on a Sale or Return basis. There has been no material change since last year in the Wreaths available but even the most discriminating Wreath purchaser will find something to his or her taste amongst the limited range of 31 general and Badge designs we are now in a position to offer, prices 7/6d.—4 guineas. With the return to more normal conditions and the removal of the many manufacturing difficulties of the present time, we hope to be able to offer a more varied range in due course. Our latest Wreath Catalogue is enclosed, and further copies of this and of the Order Form which accompanies it will be gladly sent on request. Wreaths are by no means convenient articles to store at our Warehouse in London. They are equally inconvenient for the Rail ways to handle in any great quanitity at any one time. It is hoped, therefore, that those Organisers who will be taking a selection on a Sale or Return basis or, indeed, any Wreath purchaser, will be kind enough to help us by ordering and taking delivery as long before November as possible. Please remember also that by ordering early5 there will he no fear that the Wreath will not arrive in time. Your choice will be wider too. Wreaths, of course, can be ordered for use at any time of the year. FIELDS OF REMEMBRANCE. During the War fewer Fields of Remembrance were organised, but the return of Peace has seen a renewal of interest. We would like to see a universal adoption—in every town and village—of this sympathetic and very appropriate observance. According to reports from many districts the most usual—and certainly the most appropriate—place for a Field of Remembrance is at some spot within the precincts of the Parish Church or at the War Memorial. The Rector or Vicar of the Parish will usually be very glad to take an active part in the Field, and, at some pre-arranged time, to hold a Service of Dedication there. We have a fair stock of Remembrance Crosses in London and will welcome instructions from Organisers to send a supply for sale during this coming November. MOTOR MASCOTS. After a lapse of some years the Poppy Factory, benefiting from a slight easement of the supply situation, has been able to renew the manufacture of Poppy Mascots for Motor cars. The new mascot, of which a comparatively limited supply will be available this year, is of even better quality than the pre-War article. It will have the usual metal clip for attaching it to the car but the three poppies, instead of being of waxed paper, will be made of waxed lawn. With many tens of thousands more cars on the road this year we see new opportuni ties for augmenting district Poppy Day collections and it is hoped that Poppy Day Committees will appoint one of their number, perhaps someone connected with the motor or garage industry, to be personally responsible for such sales. To ensure the economical use of the supply available it is as well, if possible, to obtain firm orders for the mascots well in advance of Poppy Day. DONATIONS. A most valuable section of any local Poppy Day effort is a direct appeal to selected local residents. This so often means a cheque for a guinea or upwards from some kindly disposed person who, if he were not approached in this way, would probably limit his help to Poppy Day to placing a coin in the collector’s box. We must give people the opportunity to give. It is, perhaps, contrary to human nature for the individual to make this opportunity for himself. It is suggested that in those districts where this particular angle of the Remembrance Day Appeal has not previously been tried out, Organisers6 will be kind enough to compile a list of likely donors and to send a direct appeal for gifts to augment the local Poppy Day total. For this purpose we shall be glad to send, so far as present stocks permit, a supply of Poppy Day noteheading and leaflets to enclose with the appeal. POLICE REGULATIONS. Again, in 1945, there were instances of difficulties arising from breaches of the regulations governing street collections. It is true that the offences were only of a technical character but even these can be avoided if closer attention is given to the terms of the regulations under which the Police Authorities in the various districts allow us to sell poppies on November 11th. A reprint of the regulations in question is, therefore, enclosed for your information. ACCOUNTS. One of the Police Regulations referred to in the preceding note deals with the financial return which has to be sent to the Authorities within one month of Poppy Day. These returns are prepared and submitted by Poppy Day Headquarters but it is not possible for the necessary action to be taken unless the Collection and full details of it are in our hands. Sometimes it is impossible, owing to outstanding events or Wreath payments, for the district Organiser to supply all details but the return in question refers particularly to street collections, and it is hoped, therefore, that this part of the work may be completed well within the month, and a remittance sent to us during that period, in order that the return can be prepared and sent in to the Authorities by the due date. STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT AND ANALYSIS OF POPPIES. This combined form which accompanies these notes, and the completion of it by our Organisers in all possible detail, is a valuable aid to the efficiency and productivity of the national Poppy Day organisation. It is earnestly asked that the form may, in all cases, be completed in detail and sent to Poppy Day Headquarters with the cheque for the amount due to the Fund. CO-OPERATION WITH NEIGHBOURING COMMITTEES. There is in most cases close co-operation between Organisers of districts which border on each other. In the limited number of cases, however, where such co-operation does not exist the Organisers concerned are particularly urged to get into touch one with the other in order that definite boundaries between their respective districts may be fixed and wasteful overlapping of effort so avoided.7 Quite apart from the value of such contacts in determining such questions as boundaries, etc., it is an excellent plan for a number of Organisers to get together occasionally. In this way successful experiences and efforts can be exchanged to the benefit of the Poppy Day effort as a whole. While on the subject of district Poppy Day meetings Organisers are reminded that, provided reasonable notice is given, we shall be only too happy to arrange for a representative from National Poppy Day Headquarters to be in attendance to help or advise in any way on matters connected with the organisation of our annual Appeal and the work of the British Legion which it makes possible. ADVERTISING MATTER. It is still impossible to get anything like the supply of paper which was needed for our pre-War requirements of Poppy Day posters, window bills, leaflets and other items. For the time being, therefore, the supplies available are still on the limited side. Organisers are urged to requisition only for such advertising material as they are certain can be definitely placed, and even then not to be unduly disappointed if it proves impossible for the full quantity asked for to be supplied. SELLERS’ EQUIPMENT. Collecting Boxes and Sellers’ Trays are also very much more difficult to obtain in sufficient quantities than they were in 1939. We shall be only too glad to arrange for essential replacements of locally held stock which is unfit for further use, but in order to ease the supply position generally Organisers can give material help by ensuring that the greatest care is taken, not only in the use of these two items, but in the subsequent storage in the periods between appeals. Collecting Boxes found defective after Poppy Day should be returned to our Warehouse as soon as possible for repair. SUPPLIES. As has been previously mentioned in these notes supply difficulties are still being encountered in the British Legion Poppy Factory. The more expensive types of poppies are, therefore, still not so plentiful as they were before the War and Organisers are particularly urged to order only those quantities of these more expensive items that they are certain can be disposed of by their Sellers at the minimum prices which are shown on the requisition form. In this connection, perhaps we might again stress the importance of making it clear to Sellers that while a 3d. Poppy should immediately be made av ailable to any person unable to pay more than a Id. for it, it is a dis-service to the Fund and to the men it serves if the more expensive types of%~v 8 poppies are given in exchange for contributions less than those noted against each item on our requisition form. When poppies are sold at less than the minimum prices it has, of course, the effect of increasing very materially our costs of collection and thus decreasing the amount of money available for our welfare work. In spite of supply difficulties it has been found possible this year to re-introduce the three-poppy Motor Car Mascot and Spray for sale at 2/6d. and l/6d. respectively. The Mascot has already been dealt with in these notes but Organisers are reminded that in past years the Spray has been widely purchased for Church and Altar decoration, for which purpose it is most attractive and appropriate.\b BRITISH LEGION APPEAL, (HAIG’S FUND) Lansdowne Lodge, Petersham Road, Richmond, Surrey. SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT Poppy Day this year is Saturday, November 9th Dear Organiser, An important change of plan for Poppy Day this year has been forced on us by the recent Government announcement about the new Remembrance Day. I have now to inform you that POPPY DAY THIS YEAR (194G) WILL BE SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 9th and NOT Monday, November 11th as previously stated. The Government announced on June 18th that the Sunday prior to November 11th would in future be the National Day of Remembrance for the fallen of the two wars: 1914-18 and 1939-45. This announcement made it imperative that the Legion’s Council should very seriously reconsider our Poppy Day arrangements. Up to that moment our intention was to adhere to November 11th. I think you will fully agree that the Council had no other alternative than to decide, as it has done, that our Poppy Day Appeal should be held the day before the new Remembrance Day—that is, this year, Saturday, November 9th. As the person responsible for the sale of Poppies in your area you will I am sure agree that the new plan is the obvious arrange ment. It has many advantages. I will mention just four— (1) The principal purpose of Poppy Day is to raise the maximum revenue to enable the Legion to meet the rapidly increasing calls for help from ex-service men and women. A Saturday street collection is more liberally supported than collections made on any other day. -5 3(2) Poppy Day Organisers in most areas will agree that volunteers for Poppy selling are more readily obtainable on a Saturday. (8) The sale of Poppies on the Saturday will give everybody the opportunity of obtaining their emblem in readiness for the following day’s (Remembrance Day) ceremonies. Those people who still wish to commemorate the 11th will also have had their Poppies in time. (4) The new Remembrance Sunday is the natural climax and close to Remembrance Week. The Saturday sale of Poppies comes, therefore, within the week. To continue to sell Poppies on the Monday, the 11th, would he an obvious anti-climax endangering the whole success of the Appeal. I sincerely hope you will not be seriously inconvenienced by this decision. I believe that you will welcome it as a means of stimu lating still greater public interest in the annual sale of Poppies.

Last year, by your efforts, you raised the record total of over one million pounds, an achievement of which vou can be proud, and for which the whole country may well be grateful. This year, two new factors influence our appeal, hirst, it is the British l egion’s Silver Jubilee year, bor twenty-five years you have been working and caring for the welfare of ex-Service men and their dependents, of whom there are still many in need and distress. 1 hope that this milestone in our' journey will be worthily commemorated. The second fact is the recent demobilization of four million men and women. This vast figure O imposes on us new r tasks, and offers us a new challenge. When Poppy Day comes, you can surely go out into the cities, towns and villages, w ith the knowledge and pride of doing noble work.

Telephone: Richmond 0131 The Queen's Message ''THE gracious and inspiring 1 message from Her Majesty the Queen, which we are proud to publish in this second num ber of “Poppy Post,” will be a cherished recognition of past work and a splendid incentive to all concerned with the Poppy Day effort throughout the World. In her position as President of the Women’s Section of the British Legion the Queen knows full well how heavily the British Legion generally must rely on the yearly Poppy Day revenue to carry on its magnifi cent work for British ex-Service men and women. Her Majesty knows also how much time and effort the many thousands of voluntary workers give to the Appeal throughout the world. The Royal Message stresses two new factors relating to our Appeal this year — the Silver Jubilee of the British Legion and the fact of the recent demobili sation of 4,000,000 men and women of the 1939-45 Forces. The first Poppy Day—this is our 26th—came some months before the official foundation of the Legion. The Poppy Day Appeal in fact started ahead of the wel fare and benevolent organisation for which it provides. We must ensure that it keeps ahead. We must ensure in fact that Poppy Day, 1946, will provide the means to assist the many thousands of the 4,000,000 who will call for help from the British Legion in the coming year. The Royal Message is both a stirring challenge and a fine encouragement to all to “go out into the cities, towns and villages with the knowledge and pride of doing noble work” towards this end. The War-time Poppy fT is true to say that the success A of the Poppy Day Appeal trom its incepiion has been due in no small measure to the quality of our Poppy Emblem. War-time conditions however necessitated the introduction of utility Poppies as well as utiliiy clothes! But at least it was pos sible to avoid severe rationing of Poppies. The War-time 3d. and 6d. buttonhole poppy styles, the sub ject of some criticism, must be recognised as the product of a war emergency. After reading the special article on the Factory in the current issue there will surely be general agreement with the view that the British Legion Poppy Factory did re markably well to continue pro ducing Poppies at all during the six years of total war. Serious shortages of material still exist and will continue to exist for several years. Poppy Day H.Q. and the Factory are striving to improve the quality of all Poppy styles as soon as possible. * * * * Thanks to all these... T HE Poppy Day Appeal has been greatly indebted over the years to the Press, both National and Local, the B.B.C., and fo tire AdvertTsTng wnrtri at large, for the . free publicity opportunities given so readily and so generously to Poppy Day Headquarters at this season. In spite of the various restric tions on newsprint at the moment temporarily and partially lifted only, Newspapers, the B.B.C., Advertisers and Agents continued to give us their kindly support during the War years, and do so once again this year. With private enterprise in all its variety crying out for the space to make the Public aware of its products and services, and Government Departments be coming increasingly big space buyers themselves, we count ourselves fortunate indeed to have received such valuable and gracious assistance from those controlling the varied publicity and advertising mediums. » » # * NEWS! NEWS! DOPPY POST No. 3 will be * devoted entirely to news and picture reports of our 1946 Poppy Day effort throughout the world. We hope to get it to Press just as quickly as pos sible after Saturday, November 9th. We want our No. 3 issue to be truly representative of the remarkable variety of ways and means by which the Poppy Day Appeal—the greatest one- day appeal in the World—is launched and the reception given it by the public- every where. the peppl), A CANADIAN Professor of Medicine, an American schoolteacher, a French social worker, and a British Field Mar shal-all these played a part in making the Poppy our Flower of Remembrance. Colonel John McCrae, the Canadian, was a Professor of Medicine at Magill L'niversity. He was serving as a Medical Officer with the first Canadian Contingent when there came a lull in the second battle of Ypres in 1916. In the little first-aid post of which he had charge he wrote in pencil on a page torn from his despatch book these verses: In Flanders’ fields the poppies blow Between the crosses, row on row, That mark our place; and in the sky The larks, still bravely singing, fly Scarce heard amid the guns below. We are the dead. Short days ago We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, Loved and were loved, and now we lie In Flanders’ fields. Take up our quarrel with the foe i To you from failing hands we throw The torch; be yours to hold it high •O - If ye break faith with us who die We shall not sleep, though poppies grow In Flanders’ fields. The poem was sent anonymously to Punch, who pub lished it under the title “In Flanders’ Fields.” Magazines all over the world reprinted it, and “Flanders’ Poppies,” as the verses were popularly called, became one of the most-quoted poems- jLll- our language; Colonel McCrae was not to see how famous his lines were to become, for he died in hospital in May, 1918, and is buried in France. Late in 1918, Miss Moina Michael, a schoolteacher then serving on the staff of the Y.M.C.A. Overseas Headquarters at Columbia University, was reading a copy of a magazine in which Colonel McCrae’s poem was reprinted. The verses made such a deep impression on her that she resolved always to wear a poppy as a sign of remem brance. That same day three of the overseas Secretaries of the Y.M.C.A. who were attending a Conference made a small gift of money to Miss Michael as a tribute to her work as hostess to them. She went straight out and with the money bought 25 red silk poppies. When she showed the poppies and the verse which had inspired her to buy them to the Conference Secretaries they each insisted on buying a poppy from her, the money going to a fund lor the war-disabled and war-orphaned. Miss Michael devoted all her leisure after that to making the Poppy the Flower of Remembrance, and through her efforts it was adopted as such by the American Legion. The Frenchwoman, Mme. Guerin, while touring the U.S.A. on behalf of French war-relief organisations, had the idea of selling poppies to help ex-Service men and their dependents. When Mme. Guerin’s suggestion of selling poppies was made to Field Marshal Earl Haig, Founder of the British Legion, it met with his ready approval. The poppies needed for* the Legion’s first Poppy Day Appeal, in 1921, were made in France, mainly by the women and children who were then returning to the devastated areas. So sympathetically did the British public respond to this first Appeal that in 1922 a factory employing five disabled ex-Service men was started to make Poppies in this country. To-day an up-to-date factory employing over 300 disabled ex-Service men is kept busy all the year round to meet the great demand for the Poppy The 1946 Poppy appears as the Flower of Remembrance m 54 countries. And such is the sympathy of the British public for its e^-Service men and women that the Poppy Day Appeal far surpasses any other one-day freewill offering in the world. “In Flanders’ Fields’’ is reproduced by permission of the Proprietors of PUNCTT. b■■■■■■■ October, 1946 POPPY POST They beat the Blitzes and overcame the shortages of the War! How the POPPY FACTORY carried on . . . I N 1943 a bottleneck in the assembling of condensers, wanted chiefly for Radar, was holding up the bombing of Germany. The British Legion Poppy Factory at Richmond was asked to help with this work, and at once put about eighty of its best men (1914-18 veterans mosily, but including a few disabled men of the 1939-45 war) at the disposal of the makers of the condensers. So well did they work that the bottleneck was quickly broken. In all 10,000,000 condensers were assembled. And at the same time, despite all the difficulties and shortages of the War years, the Factory never once failed to meet the big demand for the Poppy. During the period 1939-45 the Factory manufactured well over 200,000,000 Poppies and approxi mately 250,000 Poppy Wreaths. Alternatives planned in advance Mr. B._K. Reid, Works Mana ger, h/ 1 told Poppy Post how all this was done. “We always tried to anticipate what might become short,” he said, “and we would be thinking of an alter native—and its manufacturing problems—well in advance. “Even before the War started we laid in a good stock of crepe paper. It lasted us right through the War years, and we are still drawing on it to-day. “Immediately War was de clared we voluntarily made adjustments which resulted in a saving of over 50 per cent, in the amount of cloth used in the Poppy petals. “It is a most interesting fact that it was not the lack of any material directly used in the manufacture of the Poppy itself which caused the greatest drop in quality, but the need to con serve ^ie’ cardboard used in makings boxes for transport. In the boxfes in wh'ch pre-war we packed 50 of the 6d. variety we had now to put 500! This un avoidable crushing did more than anything else to spoil the appearance of the war-time Poppy. But we halved our con sumption of cardboard right from the outbreak of War.” Saving metal for the centres By changing “Haig’s Fund” on the metal Poppy centres to “H.F.” an immediate saving in metal of 60 per cent, was made. Sheet metal of high grade must be used for the centres, as inferior metal has variat'ons in quality causing damage to the expensive tools which cut the parts for the centres at the rate of 500 a minute. Metal for this purpose became very short in 1942, and at the end of that year paper centres were substituted. The paper centres When the paper centre was introduced “Haig’s Fund” was printed closely over and over again on the'sheet from which the centres were cut. Thus the centres could be cut out any where and always carry the lettering and the maximum number cut from each sheet. Printing was done on both sides of the sheet, in order that when the Poppy maker had the centres on his bench in front of him a “right side” always came uppermost as he rapidly attached stems to centres. Wreath “ substitutes M were better Wreath-making went on suc cessfully, too. When it was seen that supplies of fibre, used as a foundation on which to build the wreath, were going to be difficult, the Factory asked the Ministry of Agriculture to advise on any alternative which could be more readily obtained. Linseed straw was suggested, and has proved so satisfactory that it will be used permanently. After a lot of experimenting the Factory produced an artifi cial laurel leaf (made of Manila board), which is superior to the Magnolia leaf previously obtained from Germany and Italy, having better keeping qualities. By careful attention to the fastening of each leaf— they are not all secured in the same way—a most natural re sult has been obtained. A giant fern from Japan for merly was used for Poppy Wreath foliage. By experimenting the Poppy Factory was able to dye Australian ferns, and preserve them, and the pre-war supplies of the Australian fern, by careful preservation, have lasted right through to the present day.

With Her Majesty is Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice, President of the British Legion. “Again they served their King and Country” In a letter of thanks to the Factory the manufacturers of the condensers which had been assembled there wrote: “Now that the War has been brought to a satisfactory conclusion, this is an opportune moment to place on record the appreciation of my Board of the very con siderable contribution your men have made to the War effort of this Company. The unfolding of the great part Radar has played in bringing us to Victory will perhaps give you some idea of the importance of Condensers in the prosecution of the War and maybe this will compensate in some small measure for any worry that the making of Con densers may have caused you. “The men of the Poppy Fac tory can indeed feel proud to know that not only did they give of their best in the 1914-18 war, but that they have again served their King and Country well in the recent War ” The Factory also put floor space and its plant at the dis posal of another condenser maker whose factory had been blitzed. They braved the danger ! Bombing, flying bombs and rockets were ever - present danerers. One bomb, narrowly missing the Factory, hit a shelter on the adjoining Factory estate, killing three wives and eight children of the men. The top floor of the Factory wds not used for a time owing to the bomb da nger. O n the men’s Thsistence, however, work was resumed there, though this meant that they could not get to shelter during an “Alert” and that their chances of escape were slight had the Factory been hit. Remember—this great effort was made by disabled men, many of whom are on crutches and who had the greatest diffi culty in getting about during the black-out. You can visit the Poppy Factory T O the British Legion Poppy Factory come many parties of visitors who are shown Poppy-making at all its stages. Between May and September. 4,407 visitors—in 111 organised parties, mostly from British Legion’ Women's Sections—have seen over the Factory. Visits to the Factory are not possible from October 17th to the end of November this year. Application for facilities to vis- ; t should be made direct to the Secretary, British Legion Poppy Factory, Petersham-road, Rich mond, Surrey, and not to BriFsh Legion Headquarters or Poppy Day Headquarters. Visits can be arranged in the afternn-ms of Monday to Thursday, inclu sive. from 2 p.m. onwards. The Poppy Factory can be reached by 65 ’bus from Rich mond station (Southern Railway and District Line).4 POPPY POST October, 1946 An Organiser describes her Field of Remembrance T HIS interesting description of how the Field of Remem brance is arranged at Newport, Mon., has been received from Mrs. Claude Martyn, the Poppy Day Organiser. The Newport Field of Remem brance is situated in a very beautiful natural setting in the sunken ground of a ruined castle. The front of the garden adjoins the main street, and the public are able to see the Field through the railings which sur mount a low wall. There is a gate and some steps by which they can enter to place their crosses on the lawn. In the foreground of the smooth green lawn of sea- washed turf Mrs. Martyn places one very large wooden cross with a Poppy Wreath on it. Spaced at intervals on either side of this are smaller crosses representing different branches of the Services (and especially the local units) inscribed, and hung, where appropriate, with their Regimental Colours. For local bodies, such as Free masons, PoFce Force and Clubs, there are other tall crosses. In front of these large crosses the small sixpenny crosses of Remembrance are tightly massed in the form of a square. The rest of the lawn stretches a long way back from the railings and this is covered with small crosses, planted, not in regular straight lines, but anyhow, which gives a really lovely effect. Mrs. Martyn sells the greatest proportion of her crosses per sonally by appeals by letter and telephone, before the Field is planted. Then a whole week before Armistice Day, these previously - sold crosses are planted, and the Field grows from day to day by purchases made by the public from helpers who are posted at the gate of the Field. The whole of the grass is thus covered by November 11th. In pre-War days the local Authority gave flood-lighting at night, which was a great asset. Last year for the first time every cross was painted white, and resulted in a 100 per cent, improvement in the appearance of the Field. Publicity Pays!

To British Troops in every Overseas Command Poppies have also gone. By sea and by air they have been sent. In the last 4 to 5 months Poppy Day Headquarters has des patched no less than 45.000,000 Poppies and 55,000,000 Wreaths to Poppy Day Organisers and Committees all over the world. The Poppy will be seen in the streets of no less than 54 Countries on the coming Novem ber 9th. Passengers on ocean going liners will also be “button holed” on board ship. From the outset, this year, we were determined at Poppy Day Headquarters • to give British people everywhere, however distant from home they might be. the opportunity—wh^ch War made impossible for six long years—of purchasing the Ponpv, the established Emblem of Re membrance for British War dead. We set. out to do this because it is the Rrit : sh people themselves who. right from the ipcentinn of Poppy Day in 1921, established the Poppy as the un disputed Emh’em for those who fell during battle for their country. It was the manner in which the Public themselves adopted the Poppy from the first which was one of the primary reasons for the con- tirnmd success of the Poppy Day Appeal. The Government, announced this year a new Remembrance Day for both wars. So passes' the pre-War Armistice Day. The introduction of the new Remem brance Day heralds, we feel, the opening of a new series of Poppy Days. Poppy Day, 1946, is the first of a series for which we can claim and call for the greatest public 'support ■ for the millions who served in the Forces between 1939-45 and are now ex-Service, and many of them in need. It is the local Poppy Day Com mittee, the local Organizer, the thousands of local Poppy Day sellers, who present the Public with the opportunity of recogm's- ing their debt to those who fell, and their dependents, by re membering practically on Poppy Day. The local Poppy Day organisa tion is all important. * We at Poppy Day Headquarters can only serve the local Poppy Day Organizer. Without his or her enthusiasm and sp’endid efforts, without the invaluable support of the many thousands of Poppy Sellers, Poppy Day Headquarters can do nothing. The credit is yours for another magnificent Poppy Day resu’t^- for magnificent we are confident it will he. So— Bright weather and Good Luck to all who help on Poppy Day!POPPY POST. 5 October, 1946. claims have been turned down by the Government Pensions Department. No less than 80,000 pension cases are on its books to-day. It daily receives “Thank You” letters from men and women for whom it has finally obtained pensions. Often these successful applicants acknow ledge their debt by sending a donation to Haig’s Fund. Add these figures together and the expenditure of £780,606 is explained. In outline this is the story of what the Ponpy Day collection makes possible. Pat and Valene Hooker, aged 5, are the first twins in the new British Legion Women’s Section Home for the orphans of eX'Service men and women, at Richmond. An eX'Service man, dis* abled in the War, waves a greeting to a visitor to the British Legion Home where spinal cases are given a special course of training to fit them for civilian life. AIA. THIS IS MADE POSSIBLE JftECAUSE of the support of 4he thousands of Poppy Day organisers and-sellers—the greatest hand of voluntary ivorkers in the world — the British Legion was able to dis pense grants, and maintain and develop its many and varied benevolent and welfare schemes, INVOLVING THE EXPEN' DITURE OF NO LESS THAN £ 786 , 606 , IN ONE i2'M0NTH PERIOD. This was the total monies expended in the year ending September 31st, 1945. (Audited figures for the year 1945/46 are not yet available, theremre no official figures can be given). But with now over 4,000.000 men and women demobilised from the 1939/45 Forces it can be taken for granted that expendi ture is increasing daily. 6#6o6I! How was it spent? The big total of £448,240 alone was dispensed by the several thousand British Legion Service Committees now operating all over the country. This big sum was expended in meeting in dividual and temporary needs of ex-Service people, taking the form of direct cash grants or of grants in kind. Temporary re lief given by a local Service Committee may cover a period of up to 8 weeks. £448,240 was spent in assisting ex-Service people up against chronic sick- you (and they) were ness, people in need of medical or dental treat ment or surgi cal appliances, people so up against it that they were not able to meet their rent or purchase sufficient food for their families. Such things as removal grants, aids for orphan children and after care of children are also covered. And small business loans also were given to assist ex-Service men starting up in business^ Nearly £156,400 was expended on the Legion’s permanent schemes over the year—on such enterprises as the British Legion Country Homes (£50,000). £53,000 of this was allotted to the Officers’ Benevolent Depart ment to assist the many ex- Officers up against financial and other difficulties on their return to civil life. Assistance was given to the National Car Attendants Com pany, which pro vides employment for many lesser dis abled men; to Preston Hall, the Legion’s special tuber culosis home. Under this section also are costs of such specialised training as that for sons of ex- Service men on the training ship H.M.S. “Stork.” Approximately £146,766 was expended in direct grants to other welfare organisations. Of these the chief was the famous St. Dunstan’s Home for the Blind, which receives a yearly minimum grant of £15,000 and which in 1944/45 received £32,000. Assistance given to St. Dunstan’s out of the Poppy Day collection is based on the actual numbers of blind men they help. As the numbers of blind ex - Service men entering St. Dunstan’s increase, so the grant to St. Dunstan’s automatically increases. Some 20 other welfare organi sations also receive a yearly grant, another of them being the Gordon Boys’ School, which in 1944/45 received £4,000. About £35,200 was the adminis trative cost of the British Legion’s big and increasingly su ccessf ul Empl oyment and Pensions Department.

To Romantic Places... 'pllw 2,001,070th Poppy was despatched overseas a few days ago. Before November 9th the little Flower of Remem brance will have travelled over oceans and deserts, through jungles and across plains to wherever there is a handful of British people. Romantic names appear in the long list of places to which the Poppy has gone—Iquique, in Chile, Ciudad Trujillo, in the Dominican Republic, British Solomon Islands, the Belgian Congo, Fernando Po, Fiji, Morocco, the Falkland Islands, the Azores and Ethiopia. To the British forces in Japan has gone a large consignment. Our men in Germany and Italy will have red Poppies, too. We say red advisedly, for in the pre-war heyday of Hitler and Mussolini it was a yellow Poppy which was produced and sent to these countries Malaya was generous The affection in which the Poppy is held is nowhere greater than in British Malaya, whose pre-war contributions were always most generous. The last letter we were to re ceive from Mrs. Nunn, who for several years organised a most successful Appeal there, was written from Singapore on January 30th, 1942. She advised us she had just cabled the pro ceeds of the previous year’s Appeal, and added, “I don’t know if this letter will ever reach you, for the Japanese are almost at our door.” Mrs. Nunn, we now learn, would not be evacuated until her husband returned from a trip inland. They eventually embarked on a ship, .which was torpedoed, and in a lifeboat Mrs. Nunn died. The tide of war passed over Malaya for a while. Then in December of last year we had a letter which enclosed £54. The money had been subscribed by peasant farmers of two districts who had wanted to show their How the Poppy Day Revenue Helps t Her DREAM came TRUE A WAR widow of Southend, Essex, has been raised from the depths of despair and now sees her dream for her son’s career coming true, thanks to the work of the British Legion Benevolent Department. While her husband, a Chief Steward in the Merchant Navy, was alive they planned to give their children, a boy of 16 and a girl of 14, a good education and a proper start in life. Their hope was that their son should follow his father into the Merchant Navy. But in 1942 the husband was killed in action. The widow received a pension of £2 4s. a week, out of which rent and rates took £2, leaving her only 4s. to provide for all the other necessaries of life. She struggled on, drawing on her dwindling savings. Too proud to ask for Public Assist ance, she even had to pawn her wedding ring. Still the tide of debt rose. Then came another shattering blow. Her son fell ill —malnutrition was the doctor’s verdict. It was then that the British Legion heard of her plight. Help w 7 as speedily forthcoming. First there was financial aid to help her out of her immediate troubles, and then the Legion turned to the problem of the son’s future. The aid of the Shipping Federation was enlisted. A place was found for the boy in a Nautical School, where he has now gone for a three months’ course. When that is over he will go to sea as a deck boy.

This year the Company des patched its supplies by one of its chartered aircraft, and the Poppies were in Abadan the day after leaving London. Me have accounts of how the varied difficulties of transport ing the Poppy overseas are overcome. From Magallanes, at the foot of South America, the supplies are sent by mule cart hundreds of miles into the interior to reach isolated British sheep farmers. Camel transport has been used for many years at Aden to get the Poppies to their final destination. A Poppy Day Appeal in the Seychelles. Poppies travel free All supplies for overseas are, by the generosity of the Ship ping Companies concerned, carried freight free. The Dock and Harbour Authorities, too, make no claim. In East African territory free transport is given to Poppy Day letters and par cels by the courtesy of the Postmaster General, and pack ages of Poppies are carried free on the Tanganyika Railway. Thus the Fund is spared the cost of transport on the Poppies despatched to more than 300 Committees who organise a Poppy Day overseas. 45 million Poppies. 45,000,000 Poppies have been made by 324 disabled ex-Service men the largest factory in the world employing only disabled labour using 100 miles of material for the petals of the Poppies 1,700 miles of wire to make the stems 17 tons of sheet metal and 5 ton of paper for the centres, and 5 tons of paste plus 145 tons of cardboard for packing the Poppies and making Sellers’ trays.

DAS. Political Agent, The Political Agency, BAHRAIN, Arabia. 16th April, 1947. Dear Sir, On the principle that 'It is the early bird which catches the worm' - to-day a sadly appropriate principle - I am writing to you at this early date about our 1947 Poppy Day Appeal, fixed for Saturday, November 8th. (By the Government decision of Midsummer last, Sunday, November 9th, will be this year’s Remembrance Day.) In the twelve months since I took over here I have often been much struck by the real strength of the world-wide support for Haig's Fund and the cause of the ex-Service people for whom we appeal. I am particularly impressed by the sympathetic feeling which exists amongst British Communities Overseas. The depth of this sympathy has been fully illustrated by the keenness with which our Poppy Day supporters in foreign countries all over the world seized their first opportunity, as hostilities ended, to recreate their own local Appeal. Our friends in British, and other, territories which were occupied by the enemy for lengthy periods, have shown the keenest desire to rebuild the local Poppy Day organisation, often in spite of the most difficult circum stances. I can assure you that we here at Poppy Day Headquarters have been tremendously encouraged by this very real enthusiasm. I am not in the least disheartened - nor I hope will you be - to know that our 1946 Poppy Day Appeal is unlikely, when the account is finally closed, to reach the £1,000,000 figure achieved for the first time in 1945. We were undoubtedly up against greater difficulties last November than in 1945; not the least of these was the ugly economic situation. To-day, our 1946 Poppy Day Account stands at £868,707 as compared with £938,484 at the same period of the 1945 Account. I believe the 1946 Account will close very near the £950,000 mark - certainly, in view of prevailing conditions, a very satisfactory figure. So, many thanks again for the part you played in the achievement of such a total. It is a sad fact that the purchasing power of our 'near £1,000,000' of 1946 is worth, if anything, slightly less than the £500,000 raised in 1938! We are unfortunately faced with this economic factor at a time when calls for help from ex-Service people are increasing rapidly as a result of the demobilisation of 4,000,000 men and women from the British Services since the end of the 1939-1945 War. It is obvious that anyone who has a liking for a tough job can find it by volunteering to assist with your Poppy Day Appeal this year! To-day, in planning for the future Poppy Day, we are con fronted - as are all consumers - with greater supply difficulties -0 17 2 supplies of Poppies, cardboard trays, collecting tins, posters, etc. - than at any time during the War years. But, in spite of this, I hope at least to give you increased support for your all important Poppy Day publicity plan by sending supplies of new literature. Such literature will emphasise the story of what the Poppy Day Appeal makes possible in terms of welfare services of all kinds - the detailed story in fact of how the Poppy Day revenue is dispensed. Our Poppy Day Headquarters Journal 'POPPY POST' was launched partly with the publicity value of this story in mind. Copies of new issues of 'POPPY POST' are being sent you regularly by Air Mail. If you would like to have additional quantities to circularise in your Area during the Appeal period I should be delighted to send as many as possible. But please give me your requirements in good time so that I may avoid the very heavy costs of Air Mail despatch. I need hardly stress that the need to achieve all possible active support for the Poppy Day Appeal is now very great. It may not be clear to some - they may, for instance, quote the relatively small Service casualty figures &lt;*f 1939-1945 as com pared with 1914-1913 - that the need really is greater than ever. Apart from the existence, after the recent War, of millions more people entitled to call themselves ex-Service - and, therefore, entitled to help from Haig’s Fund if in genuine need - there is the less obvious, but very costly factor, of the increasingly large numbers of ex-Service men of the 1914-1918 War who are now reaching the age when they can no longer fend for themselves. Again, this most recent War has definitely produced its own great ex-Service welfare problems. Not the least of these is the high percentage of ex-Servicemen and women now the victims of that unhappy disease known as 'Psycho-neurosis.' We know already that, of 130,000 discharged from the Forces during the War for Psycho-neurosis, or similar disability, only 33,000 have been awarded Pensions carrying the right to treatment and allowances. Unfortunately it is also true that there are many thousands of cases of Psycho-neurosis which have developed as a result of War service since the individual was discharged from the Services. I know that I may count on all your support to help the British Legion to achieve for the ex-S-ervice people of 1939-1945 at least the equal of what it achieved - and is still achieving - for the men of 1914-1918, and to gain even fuller comforts for the veterans as they become aged. Would you kindly complete and return the enclosed Requisition Form as early as possible in order that we may pack and ship your supplies so that they reach you in good time for your own re-distribution. Yours ■ fTAT&gt; ' Tr British Legion Appeal (Haig's F U nd)*FOR ALL WHO HELP WITH THE BRITISH LEGION POPPY DAY APPEAL. MARCH—APRIL, 1947 POPPY DAY 1946—‘NEAR £1,000,000’ PROBABLE Poppy Day Organisers’ Triumph In spite of the prevailing economic situation, more difficult than in 1945, the 1946 Poppy Day account is likely to close not short of £1,000,000. With many Overseas collections awaited, and with the National Account yet to be fully audited, an accurate forecast of the result, even at this stage, is difficult. But all indications suggest that a final total of approximately £950,000 will have been achieved by the 1946 Poppy Day Appeal. DECENT Press reports that the Poppy Day account had already closed at the total of £950,000 were incorrect. These reports were due to a misunder standing of a statement made by Brigadier-General Sir Richard Fitzpatrick, C.B.E., D.S.O., D.L., National Chairman, at the recent British Legion Eastern Area Conference (Sir Richard Fitz patrick’s statement is reported in full in page 2 of this issue). At the time of going to Press (Map^r 17th) the Poppy Day 1940 National Account stood at £900,742 IGs. 2d. as compared with £951,095 8s. Od. on, the same date last year. Whatever the final total for Poppy Day, 1946, is to be, it is already certain, at least, that it represents a triumph for the thousands of Poppy Day Organ isers and their helpers—who faced greater difficulties than ever before—and another great tribute to the voluntary spirit of British people. and public disillusionment at the progress of reconstruction, at home and of peace-making in the international sphere already existed. Prevailing economic conditions have an inevitable influence on the Poppy Day Appeal from year to year. Economic developments between Poppy Days 1945 and 1940 have become not less—but more—severe on the pocket of the man in the street. He cannot easily be persuaded to “Give Generously” when he finds him self having to thrust his hand as deeply into his pocket as he does to-day to meet the everyday cost of living. It is important that these factors should be recognised now for the influence they will have on Poppy Day this year, and that every pos sible effort should in future be made to increase the money raising possibilities of our great Appeal. Rritons will give. That is certain. But we must see to it that they do not lack the opportunity to give. Money Raising Difficulties. Those who recognise the full Tmplications of recent economic conditions will not be surprised, or disheartened, to learn of the likely decrease in the Poppy Day Collection last November as com pared with 1945.

Telephone: Richmond 0131 Spread The News TATHILE the battle rages and their deeds make news, Ser vice men and women are assured of the fullest sympathy and help of their fellow - countrymen. 1‘aradoxically, however, the material needs of Service people are comparatively few in time of War. Their difficulties come when they are no longer front page stories in the Press—in. the anxious years of peace and re construction when, as civilian^, 'they wage even sterner war against the handicaps of dis ablement and unemployment. British people cannot be told too often or too much of three fundamental truths concerning those who have fought in Britain’s Wars. The first is that thousands of ex-Servioe people, who surely deserve the best their country lias to offer them, suf fer great distress, many for years, due to a variety of causes which arise mainly out of War Service. The second is that, in the British Legion, the country has what is unquestionably the |best-equipped organisation, to help those who fall by the wayside. The third is that support to Haig’s Fund—by generous giving on Poppy Day, by postal gifts at any time of the year, by legacies, or by the pur chase of Poppy Wreaths—is the most practical means British people have to strengthen the Legion’s work for ex-Service people, and, by so doing, to pay their share of the Debt of Honour. Printed in this issue of POPPY POST are three Haig Fund ad vertisements which are to form part of a modest Press advertis ing compiaign shortly to be launched. They illustrate the needs of Haig’s Fund and those for whom it appeals. Only a limited amount of money is to be spent on this campaign, and it is hoped therefore that Poppy workers throughout the countrywill lend a hand them selves aM-. spread the news on all possible occasions and in all possible placesNvThere is no limit to the help wkith ex-Ser vice men and women wa^need and, we believe, no limit to' help which a grateful countrj will give them, if it is not allowed to forget. Legion’s Tribute to Voluntary Spirit £950,000 WELFARE EXPENDITURE THIS YEAR A fine tribute to the voluntary spirit of British people was paid by Brig.-General Sir Richard Fitzpatrick, C.B.E., D.S.O., D.L., National Chairman of the British Legion, when announcing a £950,000 welfare programme for the current year in a speech at the recent Eastern Area Conference. “T WANT to stress,” said Sir 1 Richard Fitzpatrick, ‘‘that such a big programme of wel fare expenditure is only possible by the Legion because of the British public’s magniticent sup port throughout the world for our annual Poppy Day Appeal. I am particularly anxious to take advantage of this opportunity to say, on behalf of all ex-Service people, a very deep and sincere ‘Thank you’ to the British pub lic all over the world for their unstinting support for Haig’s Fund. ‘Tt is often said that there is to-day a lack of the voluntary spirit amongst Brittjh people,” continued Sir Richard Fitzpat rick. ‘‘Yet our Poppy Day Appeal depends on the voluntary wor ker. This appeal is in fact the biggest voluntary effort of its kind in, the world and the attain ment, for the first time in 1945, of the £1,000,000 mark, as a re sult of the annual Poppy Day collection surely disproves the theory that the voluntary spirit is fast dying in this country. We of the British Legion are par ticularly anxious that the British public should realise that the credit for the many and varied welfare schemes, and the finan cial help, which we are able to provide for all ex-Service people —whether they are members of the Legion or not—is theirs en tirely.” Sir Richard Fitzpatrick an nounced that the £950,000 would be spent on the British Legion’s nation-wide welfare and benevo lent services, including grants to other ex-Service welfare organi sations. A considerable portion of this big sum would be dis pensed through the thousands of Legion Service Committees which existed all over the country to alleviate temporary needs amongst ex-Service people. But it also allowed for the finan cing of all Legion welfare ser vices, its convalescent homes, its special schemes for medical treatment, its rehabilitation and resettlement schemes, its aids to employment, and the securing of pensions for war dis abled men, and the many'other ^services which the Legion ad ministers. HOW IT WILL BE SRI £950,090 weifasrrf'expendi- ture'^vnoini««crTiy Brig.-General Sir Richard Fitzpatrick is made up primarily by a grant of £675,280 to the British Legion and United Services’ Fund Benevolent Department. This organisation is responsible for the Legion’s convalescent homes and for financing the work of the 4,500 Service Committees which daily, throughout the country, are alleviating tem porary needs of ex-Service people. £140,000 is allotted to cover the costs of the British Legion Service Administration in connection with benevolence, employment, pensions and other work. Grants of £20,000 to the Prince of Wales’ British Legion Pen sions Fund, £5,000 to the British Legion National Car Park Atten dants’ Company, £1,000 to the Women’s Section W i d o w s’ Weekly Allowances, and £2,500 to the Training Ship “Stork” have been made. Also included in the £950,000 are grants, totalling more than £50,000, to 15 other ex-Service welfare organisations. Of this figure no less than £43,120 has been given to St. Dunstan’s. A minimum grant of £15,000 has been made for years from the Poppy Day collection to St. Dun stan’s. In addition St. Dunstan’s is yearly given £40 for each blind ex-Service man or woman undergoing treatment. This year, with 560 men and women in their care, this capitation grant means the allotment of a further £22,400, and the final total of approximately £43,000 is made up by further capitation grants for men of Indian Units being cared for by St. Dunstan’s. Grants made to the 14 other organisations are as follows:— Joint Nursing and V.A.D. Ser vices’ Committee, £2,000; King’s Roll Clerks’ Association, £1,000; Queen Alexandra Hospital Home, Worthing. £1,000; Langford Cross Children’s Home, £50; Sir Beach- croft Towse Ex-Service Fund for the Blind,* £500; St. David’s Home, Ealing, £600; Deafened ex-Service Men’s Fund, £500; Em bankment Fellowship Centre. £300; S.O.S.

IMPORTANT. LOANS OF COLLECTING TINS. Owing to the extreme diffi culty of obtaining new sup plies from Manufacturers all Poppy Day Organisers and Branches lending Legion collecting tins to other Organisations from their local stocks are asked not to make any future loans without reference first to Poppy Day Head quarters. Over the years we have been very generous in lend ing collecting tins to other Causes. Our help in this way has cost Haig’s Fund thousands of pounds in losses and wear and tear of the big quantities of the tins stocked locally aUfV er the country. ^ Poppy Day organisers are asked now to make every effort to conserve their local stocks, by draw ing in any quantities which are to-day in the hands of other Organisations, and arranging satisfactory and dry storage. Please in future write to Poppy Day Headquarters, Lansdowne Lodge, Peter sham Road, Richmond, Sur rey, before committing your self to any further loans of tins. This m nil has the requisites of happiness — a trade, steady work, a family and a home. How different from 1944, when, stricken with tuberculosis, without a trade or even a job, this veteran of Dunkirk was almost without hope. This man’s future — physical, men tal and economic — was changed in the British Legion Village, where tuberculous ex-Servicemen are rested, treated and, when suffici ently improved in health, taught a trade of their own choosing. Other Legion endeavours for ex- Service people include • convales cent homes • women’s sanatorium • pensions fund • relief of distress due to unemployment or sickness • homes and industries for disabled • care of orphaned and physically handicapped children • find ing employment • solvin g r cr ^f? ns problems * invalid.-nairs, surgical irriiTinr'A „■ --racial limbs, etc. ftfi LEGION APPEAL HAIG’S FUND RICHMOND, SURREY.

ALL RANKS, ALL SERVICES, ALL WARS.POPPY POST 3 THE SATURDAY POPPY DAY The new plan instituted last year, to hold Poppy Day on the Saturday immediately before the official Remembrance Sunday, has been the subject of strong criticism in various parts of the country. We are anxious that readers ct Poppy Post should appreciate both sides of this certainly con troversial matter, and we set down therefore the arguments both for and against the Satur day collection. H ERE are the main objections, as expressed in letters from Poppy Day Organisers:— “The public have always ex pected to buy their poppies on the nth, and will continue to associate Poppy Day with this anniversary. Some of our local people in fact, refused to buy popm at all on the Saturday.’’ “Saturday is a bad day. The women have their shopping to do, and cannot spare the time to sell poppies.’’ “On Saturday the business and industrial areas of this City are practically empty. The day is, therefore, useless for Poppy selU ing.” “A Saturday collection lacks the sacredness and the symbolism which has for so long been attached to November nth.’’ These are reasonable and in telligent criticisms which have come from people whose judg ment we respect, but we feel that they do not perhaps see the whole problem in its broader national implications. Now for the other side of the question. It will be remembered that the Government announced in June, 1946, that the Sunday prior,#) November llth would in future be the National Day of Remembrance, for the fallen of the two Wars 1914-18 and 1939-45. This announcement made it im perative that the National Exe cutive Council of the Legion should immediately reconsider our Poppy Day arrangements. To begin with, it will surely be agreed that the Council had no other alternative than to decide firstly that the Poppy Day Ap peal should be held before the new Remembrance Day. Secondly, its decision was rightly much influenced by the desire to maintain as firm a link as possible between Poppy Day and Remembrance Day. That link, which is of so much value to our Appeal, could be most suc- cessfullv maintained by select ing the very day before Remem brance Day as Poppy Day— which is the Saturday. • The Council of the Legion, in making their decision, were in- K- fluenced in the main by the fol- . lowing important factors:— 1. The principal purpose of » Poppy Day is to' raise the maximum revenue to enable the Legion to meet the rapidly increasing calls for help from ex-Service people. A Saturday street collection is more liber ally supported than collections made on any other day. 2. A Saturday sale would give everybody the opportunity of obtaining their emblem in readiness for the following day’s (Remembrance Day) cere monies. Those people who still wished to commemorate the 11th would also have had their Poppies in time. If the Pop pies were sold only on the llth they would not be available to British people to wear on the previous Sunday (Remem brance Day). 3. The absence of Poppies on Remembrance Day would, in course of time, destroy the link between Remembrance Day and the Poppy—to the very considerable financial disad vantage of Poppy Day and to the detriment of the men and women to whose service the the British Legion’s welfare work is dedicated. 4. The new Remembrance Sunday is the natural climax and close to Remembrance Week. The Saturday sale of Poppies comes, therefore, within the week. To continue to sell Poppies on the llth would be an obvious anti climax endangering the whole success of the Appeal. These, briefly, were the factors principally responsible for the decision to make Poppy Day a Saturday collection. The Coun cil believed at the time that the decision was a wise one, and it has yet to be proved that it was otherwise. Remember, too, that the Poppy, like the Whitehall Cenotaph, is now dedicated to the men' of two Wars. In the interests of our Appeal it is essential that the public are made fully aware of this fact. To adhere to Novem ber 11th, the former Armistice Day, as our Poppy Day would— in the eye of the average mem ber of the public—make it seem that we were too 1914-18 minded. Returning to the criticisms set out in the previous column, there are, we think, quite satisfactory answers to them. We know only too well the strong and wide affection there still is—and rightly, too—for November llth, with all its asso ciations. But the new date is very close to it—at most only a few days before—and those who are primarily concerned with 1914-18 have no reason or cause at all to feel that their men have been forgotten, as they might well have done had the new Re membrance Day and Poppy Day come in the middle of the year. Surely those who would refuse to buy a Poppy merely because they are asked' to buy and wear it a few days before the llth can be so few in, number as to make lltUo or no difference to our great Appeal, in nnv case, even if a Poppy is bought, on Novem ber 9th, what is easier and morn appropriate than to leave it in one’s coat and wear it on the 9th, 10th, and the llth? Certainly it is Saturday which is the traditional British shop ping day, but is it so much now adays? ' Do not more and more women,, especially those who are not working, shop on Thursday or Friday in order to get a bet ter choice? Even if it is agreed that the shopping tasks of women prevent them from sell ing Poppies on the Saturday, tfurely the rapidly increasing practice of working a five-day week must now bring hundreds of thousands of potential Poppy sellers into the orbit of a Sat urday collection. These live-day week workers might find it very difficult, if not impossible, to sell Poppies on, say, a Thursday or a Friday. Saturday is admittedly a bad (Collecting day in the business and industrial quarters of large cities and towns. We have long since known this in the City and West End of London where the collections are organised direct from Poppy Day Headquarters. Tke collections in Central Lon don have nearly always declined when they have been made on a Saturday. RUT THE NATIONAL TOTAL HAS NOT DECLINED— which reminds us of an old say ing to the effect that “what one loses on the roundabouts one gains on the swings.” Is not the pnswer that when a Saturday collection loses money in some central area the loss will be off set by the gains in those resi dential or dormitory areas where the city workers live their pri vate lives? Finally, on what day of the week are people generally in clined to be more liberally- minded and more generous to wards their fellow beings? That day is Saturday. And on Sat urday the hundreds of thousands of the Nation’s workers have the means to put that feeling into effect because the day before- Friday—was pay day! In Brief GUERNSEY sent £1,800, nearly £450 more than last year. BANGKOK collection, made privately amongst British and Siamese friends, amounted to £435. This was £55 more than their last gift in 1940. EVESHAM District (Worcs), one of the pioneers of the Re- {membrance Week idea, again proved correct the theory that the amount raised by selling Poppies can be augmented by at least as much again from other sources. Of total of £1,736 col lected, 42 per cent, came from Poppy sales, 14.^ per cent, auc tions,“ 8 per cent, church collec tions, 11 per cent, donations, 4£ per cent, wreath sales, 20 per cent, from concerts, dances, and other social events. HONGKONG, free after the years of Japanese occupation, sent £4,322. Of this, £1,454 was collected on Poppy Day, 1941, but could not be sent at the time because of the outbreak of War in the Pacific. WIGAN (Lancs) keeps going up. The £712 collected in 1945 was £162 better than previous record, but 1946 has risen to £888. It includes £100 from a d ct n.c o PRAGUE total included gift of 200 crowns from Josef Hoch, a Czech, who asked that the money, which he had saved from his salary, might contribute to wards the happiness of some English child whose father died in defence of Czechoslovakia’s freedom. WOODCHESTER, a mid-Glou- cester village, gave at the rate of 4/6 per head of population. Is this a record for the British Isles? NANKING. The British Em bassy Staff gave regular support to Haig’s Fund before the War, but, for obvious reasons, could not do so after 1940. Although contact was lost with the indi viduals concerned, and no direct appeal was possible for 1946, a very welcome gift of £25 from the Embassy Staff has just reached us to add to the 1946 total. THE DEBT OF HONOUR You will always be grateful to the men who saved Britain from disaster — in 1914-18 and again in 1939-45 — but what are you doing to pay your share of our common debt to those who, in daily increasing numbers, are needing the help and sympathy of their fellow-countrymen. Remember always that Haig’s Fund is the practical link between YOUR gratitude and THEIR need. A -gift or legacy to Haig’s Fund — to strengthen the British Legion’s many welfare schemes for ex-Service people — is the best of all tributes to the courage and fortitude of British Service men and women in time of war.

Believing Miss Tunnington’s effort to be a record, we asked her to tell us some of her poppy-selling experiences and methods, and here is what she has written specially for POPPY POST. M Y very first collection for Poppy Day was less than one pound. Of course, the Poppy emblems were very small and realised mostly one penny each. The public had to be educated as to the purpose of the collec tion. I remember the Poppy Depot was just a litle shop in the City Centre run by a hand ful of people who had, as it were, to feel their way about. The first two or three years were much the same, but the public were getting very in terested in the Poppy emblem and the origin of the idea. Our small but energetic com mittee worked long hours and spared no effort. Gradually, as the hand-made Poppies came along, sales grew and the total collections rose steadily. In 1937 I took charge of the “Field of Remembrance”—our first in Leeds. The little Remem brance Crosses became very popular that year, and in spite of wet weather and biting winds, results were very satisfactory. How strange it is that, as I look back on the 26 “Poppy Days” I can remember only about three fine days. Very often our Committee ladies were kept busy trying to dry out the drenched Poppies which we sel lers returned. It was pathetic, but the worse the weather, the more reluctant one was to give in, and we returned to the streets determined to be up on the pre vious year’s collection. One learned not to mind a snub or two. Oh yes! There al ways will be people ready to pass a nasty remark, but the smiling way in which the great majority of the public look out for a Poppy Seller, with money in hand and a “My word, but it’s cold.for you at this corner,” or, “I always like to give to Poppy Day and think you sellers are a really grand lot to be do ing this on such a day,” and lots and lots of kind remarks. Yes, and little confidences— especially from mothers who just atrhc to tell you proudly of their son'e* s sons. Well, what if we get a feV^iubs, the nice people repay a rhqusand-fold. The last War year^Hj^re hard going. Here I must coniSSs^iat, because of Defence Duty, I unable to give quite as much time. In 1940 my collections were vjery small compaied with previous years, and I felt a real pang of regret. After 1940 my total rose again, until, in 1944, it was £40, in 1945 £58, and well, you know how much in 1946—£109 7s. O.^d. Rut don’t think 1 collected over a hundred pounds in one day! Starting on the Thursday 1 worked more or less right through to the Saturday. Shall I tell you how I did it? I wonder if I can? I had told the Committee that I wanted a “Sil ver Jubilee” collection. They asked my target and I replied, “£100”! They gasped with amazement. Most said that it would be impossible. A few knew I could do it, having set myself the •task. Relieve me, I would have been a very disap pointed woman had ' I not achieved my tai’get! However, the Committee were just as keen as I was and kept me well sup plied with Poppies, and each time I returned for a fresh box jumped to it so that I could get busy again. It is a great help to have one’s collecting tin exchanged before it gets too heavy, and to keep the tray attractive (I still adore the old tray with picture of the Poppy Field. It holds a much better supply and saves much running to and fro for supplies). A great thing, too, it is to keep moving, although I am told it is against the regulations! When people ask “How much are they” I just explain that the various Poppies represent a donation of 3d., 6d., or 1/- mini mum to the Fund—they usually respond well. If a poor-looking soul takes a fancy to the large silk Poppy and has to count up and make sure that she can afford one and finds that per haps she is a copper or two short—well, it’s much better to make that soul happy by say ing, “Well, you may have it and if you can, put the difference in some other collector’s box” than to refuse it. I’ve known people come back to me with the dif ference, and, very often a little extra. One thing I would say to col lectors—please get out of the habit of shaking the box in people’s faces. It does more harm than good—personally I ithe to have a box shake my s, &lt;ace and I’ve^^ flinch THuin (UiiU-rtms do it.” P OPPY making has been seri ously interfered with by the recent fuel cuts and deliveries of new stock for 1947 will be con- fuderably below original esti mates. There will, or course, be sufficient Poppies for everyone to wear on Poppy Day, but greater care and economy in ordering and distribution by local organisers is more than ever essential. Those organisers who already hold a stock of Poppies locally can give valuable help, when they have sufficient time avail able, by looking over these stocks, renovating any damaged items, carefully repacking them into the various categories, and finally ensuring that all such surplus stocks are distributed for sale before the n§w stocks which they will order for 1947.

The reason is that you did not give us your address. We liked the picture of the cat with its kitten on your notepaper but it didn’t help us to find you.

It will be a great help, there fore, if those who receive copies will pass them on, after they have read them, to others actively interested in Poppy Day. This is especially desirable in those cases where the local Branch, although nominally re sponsible for the appeal, actu ally delegates the work of organisation to a local resident whose name is not known at Poppy Day Headquarters and who will not therefore receive a copy of Poppy Post direct^^ rorpublication February, has been because of the ban, due to the fuel crisis, placed on the publication of periodicals.

Mails to these islands only go twice a month, are often delayed by bad weather. Each island has many small districts, and all have to be reached well ahead of Poppy Day, travelling being done by sail boat to each point. Actually there is little money in these districts, the in habitants being poor fisher folk, farmers and spongers; but they like to get Poppies.” BRISTOL raised £5,814—an in crease of £40 over the 194P^%)tal. THE MALAYAN UNION AND SINGAPORE, outstanding Poppy Day supporters prior to the War, got into their stride again with a first post-war collection of £16,965, a splendid effort.

Every year without exception since 1921, letters have appeared in the Press urging the adoption of a standard Poppy and criticising in the strongest terms the Haig Fund plan of selling Poppies in different sizes and at different prices. The “ Standard Poppy ” letter is in fact almost the hardiest of our “ Hardy Annuals.” Here is one of the latest. It appeared in a West Country paper on November 13th. Once again Poppy Day has come and gone, with its various'priced varieties of Poppies. Is it not time for a standard price Poppy? It does not seem to me to be the principle for which our folks died, that the kind of Poppy should denote the state of one’s purse. Therej^hould be a standard Poppy for If such a change of policy resulted in a drop in the collections, well, it woidd not say much for some people’s outlook. One would then see why they give and the Poppy could then revert back to its present style of suiting the purse. * * * * Haig’s Fund does not shun criticism. On the contrary, it welcomes it, knowing that con structive criticism from outside sources has on many occasions been turned to good acount in our task of raising the money needed to finance the welfare work of the British Legion. * * * * In the matter of the standard Poppy, however, the weight of argument is definitely on the side of the present plan of selling Popnies in a fairly wide range of s«nes and prices. But let us be quite fair and first consider the point of view of those who champion the standard Poppy. What are the advantages of this one-type Poppy? For It— In principle, it would he ideal to see the same emblem in every buttonhole, whether it is the but tonhole of a Minister of the Crown or the buttonhole of a miner. A general wears pre cisely the same Victoria Cross or Africa Star as a private, so why should not both wear the same Poppy as the outward sign of their remembrance of fallen comrades? There can be no ques tion that a standard Poppy would meet the wishes of those who aim to see complete democracy in matters of this kind. * * * * A standard Poppy would sim plify tremendously the work of ~nrcranisation, not 'only at Poppy Day Headquarters, blit in all the L^-flve^thousainl and more districts whichlSgedheaLiuake up theciom- plete framework Of~TLug&gt; Fund and Poppv Day. It would elfmiu ate the always difficult task of trying to assess at the beginning of each year our total require ments of each of a number of different Poppies, This is in variably a complicated and anxious problem because de mands do not remain static from year to year, and the aggregate of one year’s orders from 5,000 districts does not by any means present a reliable guide for the following year. * * * * From the financial angle a standard Poppy, which of neces sity would have to lie mass-pro duced, would more than halve present Poppy-making costs, thus leaving, in theory, more money available for welfare work. * * * * Three very good arguments! By themselves, they do, indeed, appear to present a sound case for the standard Poppy. —And Against. But let us consider the other side, the arguments which Haig’s Fund has always believed to be so strongly in favour of the multi-Poppy plan. * * * * We are proud of Poppy Day. It is the world’s largest and most successful one-day street collec tion. Would it not be dangerous to interfere unduly with what must unquestionaly be a suc cessful plan, of organisation* * * * * No district is compelled to sell Poppies of more than one kind. If it so desires, any District Com mittee has the right to order and sell one type of Poppy only. Yet, in 1940 not one district chose to do so! There have been isolated cases in the past where commit tees have ordered and sold a one- type Poppy, but these have been purely experiments, and never has the experiment been, re peated. Why? Because it was found that the collection de creased. Thus, experience has proved that a one-type Poppy sale produces less money and— this is important—the function of Haig’s Fund, and of the 5,000 district committees and organi sers on whom it places such re liance, is to raise the largest pos sible amount of money to help ex-Service people. * * * * A one-type Poppy would have to be mass-produced. Hand work could not produce 40 mil lion i'uppios. Mass production in the Poppy Fwciory would de crease the amount of work avail able for disabled men by any thing up to 00 per cent. This would mean depriving nearly 250 crippled veterans of a full time job. We must always re member that Lord Haig set as one of our primary objectives the finding of work for the dis abled. The aim of Haig’s Fund must be to increase the amount of work for disabled men,, not to decrease it. * * # * The argument that to sell Pop pies in different styles and prices is undemocratic and that the type of Poppy worn indicates the amount which has been given for it by the wearer is quite unsound. The small Poppy is not worn exclusively by poor people nor the larger Poppies by those able to give more. We each have our own individual fancies for this thing or that, and Haig’s Fund holds the very firm view that a person’s Poppy is much more likely to be a re flection of his individuality than of the probable size of his gift to the Fund. In other wmrds, one person who gives a shilling and likes, amongst other things, full measure and a large but tonhole, asks for and obtains what is popularly known as a shilling Poppy. Another will give a ten-shilling note, but as he is not much of a buttonhole wearer and is, moreover, a little timid about personal decoration, he quickly chooses the modest “threepenny” and passes on. With the feminine sex, more used to wearing sizeable buttonholes, natural or artificial, more often than not they would prefer the larger Poppies, and so on. It is mainly a matter of individual taste, and the world would in deed be an odd place were all the people in it likely to ask for precisely the same thing at the same time. * * * * Nor must it be forgotten that Poppies are not sold entirely for personal wearing. We see them in wreaths, used as church and altar decorations, in offices and homes, on cars and cycles, as Remembrance Day decorations and reminders in shop windows. How very dull and colourless these uses might become if we had only a standard Poppy. The Verdict. So we propose to carry on. making and distributing and asking British people to buy and wear Poppies of different kinds.

IN a recent issue we made an 4 appeal for interesting Poppy Day pictures, but the response was very disappointing and the few pictures which reached us were for various reasons unsuit able for reproduction. A further appeal is now made to Organisers having suitable pictures in their possession to send them without delay to the Editor of POPPY POST. In order to make good print ing blocks, however, the photo graphs must be clear and have what one might call “plenty of black and white” about them. As to the subject matter, it is essential that it should be of lirst-class Poppy Day interest, depicting for example interesting or unusual collectors or Poppy buyers, or Poppy Day events of one kind or another, and if pos sible that the background of the picture should include some in teresting topographical feature. For example, an East Coast photograph might well have a harbour and fishing vessels as a background, while Lancashire and Midland districts might be expected to send pit-head col lecting scenes, or a village in the Welsh hills, a shepherd with his sheep. Neatly arranged groups of sel lers posed against a neutral background certainly introduce us to many good and valuable friends but, to the reader of POPPY POST, such pictures might just as well come from Buenos Aires as Bootle. There is really nothing to indicate where they come from. In other words we shall be grateful, not only for your photographs, but for your really interesting photographs.

NATIONAL POPPY DAY ORGANISATION Over the years there has accumulated at Poppy Day Headquarters a mass of most valuable and interesting detail about local Poppy Day organisation—gained in the main from interviews with and letters from local Organisers, Statements of Account, Press cuttings, and the like. All this detail about local organisation has been most help ful to the Appeal as a whole, but, do organisers themselves, we wonder, know enough about the National aspects of Poppy- Day organisation? A wider appreciation of the National organisation and the work of Poppy Day Headquarters would, it is believed, lead to a much better understanding between Poppy Day Committees and Poppy Day* Headquarters, and should tend finally to lighten the tasks of both. In this and subsequent num bers of POPPY POST we there fore propose to deal briefly, in chronological order, with some of the more important points of our National Poppy Day organi sation. Here is the first. 1. POLICE PER MISSION FOR POPPY DAY AND OUR OB LIGATIONS UNDER THE “STREET COLLECTIONS ACT.” Before the annual Poppy Sale can take place permission must be obtained from all Police authorities throughout the country. As permits are usually granted in January, application from Poppy Day Headquarters has to be made in the previous December, or earlier. In one or two cases the application is made in October. Thus the National organisation of one Appeal actually starts more than a year beforehand. Our relations with the Police authorities are invariably of the happiest, and almost without ex ception our application for per mission for Poppies to be sold is agreed immediately and without difficulty. The large cities and boroughs have separate Police authori ties but for other districts County Police permission must be sought. In some cases the County permission is not granted u n t in local authorities in boroughs&gt;\irban and rural dis tricts, etc., hfrv&lt;kffrst agreed that they too have no^atnection. On occasion, this cauSws^ delay, owing possibly to long ii between Council meetings, finally all permits are received. The issue of a permit automati cally places Poppy Day Head quarters and District Committees under the obligation of ensuring that the regulations governing Street Collections are observed in detail. Most Organisers are familiar with the Regulations which exist throughout the country and which vary only in slight details. The main regula tions to be considered are those concerning:— 1. The minimum age of sel lers (varying from 15 to 18 years). 2. Selling only on the author ised date, and 3. The submission of a State ment of Income and Expenditure within four weeks from the date of collection. “Police Returns.” The last condition causes some difficulty at Poppy Day Head- quarters. For cities and boroughs it is usually possible to supply the necessary State ment in good time, but the County Statements are almost always delayed. It must be realised that, while even one dis trict collection is outstanding, it is impossible to complete a County Statement. Even after all collections and district State ments are received and the com plete County Statement is pre pared, this'Statement, before it goes to the Police authorities, must be checked throughout and certified by the Legion’s Audi tors, thus entailing still further delay. The work entailed in prepar ing these “Police Returns,” as we call them, varies from four collections in the County of Rut land to nearly three hundred in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It will be clear, therefore, that it is difficult to deal satisfactorily with this matter unless all neces sary details and remittances are furnished by district organisers well within the maximum period of four weeks allowed. A point not generally appre ciated is that the Statement of Income and Expenditure called for refers principally to Poppy Sales by means of Street Col lections. As this section of the local appeal is finished within a very short time, it should be pos sible for a local committee to send details and remittance fithin perhaps a fortnight at the of the day. It is m stood that many other amounts are not received until some time after the actual collection has been made, but the sales of Pop pies are dealt with earlier. House-to-House Collections Act. It may be of interest to Organ isers to know that Poppy Day Headquarters also has to furnish annually to the Home Office a comprehensive audited National Statement of Income and Expen diture covering Poppy Day house-to-house collections. The submission of this State ment is one of the x'egulations attaching to the Order issued by the Home Office to Poppy Day Headquarters annually under the provisions of the House-to- House Collections Act. This Home Office Order makes it unnecessary for either Poppy Day Headquarters or district organisers to ask local or County permission for house- to-house collections to be made, the Order being, in effect, an over-riding permit for the whole of England and Wales. (Continued from previous page). . . . and Letters. The response to our sugges tion that Poppy Day Organisers or other readers should send us brief letters—on Poppy Day sub jects—for publication in Poppy Post has been very small. The letters which reached us dealt mainly with such contro versial matters as the Sta^lard Poppy and the new d^^ of Poppy Day, both of which sub jects are dealt with in special articles in this issue. Perhaps the recent weather has been the cause. It certainly has limited most people’s activi ties for several weeks to the bare necessities of everyday life. Rut now the weather has changed a little for the better may we hope for readers’ letters —very brief if possible—on any Poppy Day subject of general interest?

My very real thanks to you 11-2 POPPY POST LANSDOWNE LODGE, PETERSHAM ROAD, RICHMOND, SURREY. Telephone: Richmond 0131. Points of View 1A7E believe that there is a defi- nite need for a full re-state ment to the public at large of the nature, purpose and needs of the British Legion Poppy Day Appeal. Over the years certain misconceptions have arisen both inside and outside the Poppy Day organisation which, if allowed to continue, could seriously limit the success of our one-day, national, and world-wide, call on British people. There is also great public ignorance of the func tion of our Appeal and the uses to which monies given on Poppy Day are put. When Earl Haig launched the first Poppy Day in 1921 British people everywhere gave unquali fied support. The British public recognised its responsibility to the millions who had fought, died and suffered as a result of service given faithfully to their country in the first world war. The public recognised its debt. It realised the need to support many widows and dependants. To-day, after the second world conflict of this century, it is vitally necessary that British people should again recognise this responsibility to the full. It is highly desirable that they should be satisfied that the best method of acknowledging their responsibility is still the Poppy Day Appeal. Whilst many of them remain ignorant about the purpose of the Appeal they can not be expected to appreciate our annual call to “Give Generously.” Further, there are to-day cer tain influences, points of view, and trends of thought, tending to persuade many against the need for voluntary appeals. They say it is the responsibility of the State. They suggest that those who served their country faith fully should not have to rely on “charity” when in need. There is a clear answer to such comments. This answer should be given as wide publicity as possible. Poppy Day is the day which British people all over the w r orld originally adopted as the occasion on which they would remember practically. Haig’s Fund is not a “charity.” From the (irst it has existed as a wel fare fund created by the British people themselves, as a tribute and a practical memorial to those who served their country faithfully in war. All those interested in the future of the Poppy Day Appeal should accept all appropriate op portunities—at meetings, dis cussions, and in conversation— to counteract this trend of opinion. To assist all ready to help, Poppy Day Headquarters is offer ing a series of “Talking Points,” covering all major aspects of the Poppy Day Appeal, and which may be found useful by many for use locally. You are invited to apply for these “Talking Points.” They give you the answer to such erroneous state ments that—“Poppy Day is a Flag Day,” that “the Poppy is the emblem only for the 1914-1918 war,” that “Poppy Day is an in stitution—it does not need my help,” and so on. We want a lively public in terest, and we must see that we achieve it. National Poppy Day Organisation—Serial 2 TAETAILED financial records of the world-wide Poppy Day Appeal in the previous Novem ber are completed at Poppy Day Headquarters early in May. At that moment Headquarters issues a detailed Statement to all Poppy Day Organisers, for confirmation and revision, if necessary. Pre-war, an Annual Poppy Day Report was always published giving details of all district col lections. It is regretted that this Annual Report is not likely to appear in the near future owing to the prolonged paper shortage. A good deal of trouble is always taken at Headquarters to ensure that local Poppy Day Committees are credited with monies sent to us direct from within their area—Church collec tions, Wreath payments, pro ceeds of Concerts, etc., organised by other bodies. Organisers often do not know of these amounts sent direct to Poppy Day Headquarters. It is partly to ensure all monies coming from within a Poppy Day dis trict are credited to the local Poppy Day organisation, that a final financial Statement is sent out; so that Organisers and Com mittees have a complete record of their Appeal result. Only if they disagree with this final Statement is it necessary for Organisers to take action on re ceipt of the Statement. The issue of the “Green, Slip” (Poppy Day Report), represents in fact the closure of the pre vious year’s Poppy Day Appeal. Concurrent with its issue we immediately begin active pre parations ' for the following November’s Appeal (preparations so far as Poppy Day Headquar ters itself is concerned—on a national level—have already be gun as early as last October!). Conserve Your Stocks All Poppy Day Organisers are earnestly requested to do their utmost to conserve whatever stocks of Poppies, Wreaths, Collecting Tins, Trays and other materials they may have in store locally, that all such stocks are made use next Poppy Day. The supplies which are held locally throughout the country represent a very big stock when totalled up. The value of this stock runs into many thousands of pounds. From this point of view alone this stock cannot be allowed to deteriorate. But there is a more immediate and practi cal aspect even than that. To day, Poppy Day Headquarters- like all consumers—is finding it more difficult than at any time during the war, to achieve the very large quantities of supplies required for world-wide distribu tion for the coming Poppy Day. The Poppy Factory, like all producers, is finding it impos sible to obtain supplies of materials for poppy making, for cardboard tray production, and so on. Poppy making is not an essential industry—no priority therefore is allowed. We are all They are asked to ensure fit, in so far as is possible, for doing our best to overcome the many difficulties with wjhich we are confronted. But Organisers generally must once again anti cipate short supply when esti mating their requirements for next Poppy Day. They can pro vide against some of the short ages to-day by overhauling stocks held locally, and by en suring that what is in good con-- dition to-day will still be so six months hence. It is known that many hun dreds of thousands of the war time 3d. poppy have been accu mulating locally. This type of poppy was never too popular. But it must be used up or the appeal will incur financial loss. The stock of wreaths available this year will almost certainly be the lowest for years, due to the opening very shortly of our post-war overseas wreath laying service. The Coming Appeal. Our first desire, as early as possible now, is to hear from local Organisers and Committees that they also are about to begin preliminaries for the coming Appeal. For this purpose, a post card is sent with the “green slip,” which Organisers are re quested to complete, stating the name and address of the person to whom this year’s Appeal de tails and order forms should be sent, and giving information re garding the Towns and Villages to be included in the district for which the Organiser and his or her Committee is responsible. It would be of the greatest value to Poppy Day Headquarters if all Organisers would give as full de tails as possible of their boun- /darie^. Unless they do this, Headquarters can never be cer tain whether the whole Country is adequately covered by the Organiser’s network. Every year there are, of course, numerous changes in the list of official Organisers held at this Headquarters. Where an Organ iser is unable to carry on as the person, officially responsible for the Poppy Day'Appeal it is quite essential that the fact should be known as early as possible at Headquarters. Considerable dif ficulty and complication can occur if Organisers leave it very late into the year before making their decision as to whether they can or cannot undertake the re sponsibility again. Poppy Day Headquarters exists to serve the many thousands of voluntary workers to whom the credit for the continued success of the Poppy Day Appeal be longs. Reasonably prompt and ac curate reports from Poppy Day Organisers and Committees everywhere represent the surest hope of fulfilling our ambitions to give local Poppy Day Appeals better support this year, and in future years, than ever before in the history of the Appeal. To be ambitious to-day an absolute necessity—unless we hold on to the £1,000,000 standard achieved in, 7945 and climb with in the next few years to a £1,500,000 standard, the British Legion will be incapable of meet ing the rapidly increasing calls for help now being made on it by the many hundreds of thou sands of ex-Service men and women who have served their Country faithfully in War, and their widows and dependents. The Near £1,000,000 At the time of going to Press (May 22nd) the National Poppy Day Account stood at £956,883 as compared with £996,278 at the same date last year. The £950,000 mark has been reached and passed. (The “Near £1,000,000” forecast in our last issue is a little nearer!) The latest forecast of the Grand Total is £965,000—£970,000. So near and yet so far. It is just possible, though not likely, that a few large unexpected collections may yet be received to bring the total even nearer the £1,000,000. It is of interest to note that a large proportion of the £39,000 decrease to date is due to the inevitable drop in collections re ceived from His Majesty’s Forces.1947. Supplement to POPPY POST. BETWEEN OURSELVES, supplements to Poppy Post are for the private information of Poppy Day Organisers and Committees only. Matter contained on this sheet is not intended for circulation to the general public or the Press. EMPHASIS ON PUBLICITY by r pHE use of up-to-date and attractive publicity material is essential to the Poppy Day Appeal to-day. A live publicity campaign is perhaps the Appeal’s greatest need at this moment. Hence our title, “Emphasis on Publicity,’’ and our intention to devote the whole of this supplement and the sup- pleufbnt to Poppy Post No. 6, to the subject of publicity. We need an extensive and carefully planned publicity cam paign to support our Poppy Day Appeal. Publicity in most forms unfortunately requires paper. Supplies of paper are very Severely rationed and further cuts have recently been imposed. We shall not get all we want. It is because of this that we are bringing our publicity plan to the attention of Poppy Day Organisers now. Given the details and form of our posters, leaflets, etc., we hope that some Organisers and Com mittees at least may find ways and means of implementing from local sources supplies issued by Headquarters. The sug gestion now is that good friends of the Appeal may be found who are in a position to produce pos- terf^.td leaflets for you locally at little or no cost to the Appeal. Printers are friendly people- even to-day—and the ex-Service cause has many good supporters amongst them. bv The Approach to the Public But firstly, the general prin ciples and the method of ap proach. For too long now the man in the street has regarded the Poppy Day Appeal as some thing which “just happens.” If he thinks of the Appeal at all, he regards it as “an institution” something which does not re- quire, or does not want, his active interest. Because it means money—big money—to us, we must do our utmost to correct this impres sion. We want—above all else— a lively public interest in the Poppy Day Appeal and what it enables the British Legion to do for ex-Service people. Our pub licity programme this year is in tended primarily to make the public itself aware that this is our need. . . The function of our Appeal Organisation, both nationally and locally, is to provide the public with the opportunity to give on Poppy Day. Public readiness to give, and the extent Captain B. H. R.

SURREY Illustrated above is the new General Poppy Day Poster referred to on this page. Details are as follows : — Description—Double Crown General Poppy Day Poster (20' x 30'). Copy and Colour Details—The illustration above gives the exact effect, and reproduces full details of the actual 20 x 30 poster, except that it does not give the colour combination. Colour combination is poppy red and black. Details in red are the title POPPY DAY at the top, and all words which in the reproduction above appear grey, e.g. YOUK, GIVt, SELL, SEND, etc., etc. The field at the base of the poster carries, of course, red fiowers and a black ground base. The background is white. , , , . , • The whole poster is set in the usual black and red rule, black being the inside rule. of public generosity, depend pri marily on its knowledge of, and regard for, the cause which it is being asked to support. It is the function of “publicity” to provide that knowledge and so influence public opinion that it will be sympathetic to the ex-Service cause. It started that way in 1921. But it would seem that the Poppy Day organisation itself—and certainly the public—is over looking this fact to-day. To-day —this year—it is vitally neces sary that British people should be made to recognise to the full their responsibility to the mil lion who still suffer as a result of the 1914/1918 war, and to the added millions who now suffer as a result of service given faith fully to their country in the second world war of this century. For the public to recognise its responsibility is the first essen tial. The second essential is that the man in the street should be satisfied that the best and hap piest method of acknowledging his responsibility is still the 26- year-old Poppy Day Appeal. To do this he must have the oppor tunity of knowing what is done with the money which he is asked to give. “Poppy Day is the Public’s Day” if only be cause it is public money which is collected that day.* Whilst very many people re main ignorant—and they are extraordinarily ignorant—about the purpose of our Appeal and the true use made of their money, it is wishful think ing to expect them to “Give Generously.” We must get at them. Poppy Day is the Public’s Day So, to counter the “Poppy Day is something which happens” theory we base our publicity this year' on the principle that “Poppy Day is the Public’s Day.” Important CHANGE OF ADDRESS All readers are asked to note that Poppy Day Headquarters changes its address in approximately a month’s time. For purposes of the local production of posters, handbills, etc., it js therefore essen tial that the address shown in the illustra tions on this sheet should be amended to read: British Legion Appeal (Haig's Fund), 26, Eccleston Square, London, SSupplement to POPPY POST. 1947. The Two Principles In a nutshell, therefore, we approach the public this year with the phrase—or slogan if you like—(which arises directly from the principle that “Poppy Day is the Public’s Day”)—that it is “YOUR DAY” — “YOUR WAY.” To do what? To “Main tain and strengthen your greatest welfare organisation for ex-Service men and women of all ranks, all Services, and all Wars—and their families, and the widows and children of those who fell.” There is the beginning of the story of what the Poppy Day Appeal makes possible in terms of the in dividual’s welfare. Persuade the public that the success of Poppy Day is ITS re sponsibility. Tell the public the story of what is done with the moneys it gives on Poppy Day. Those are the two main prin ciples upon which our publicity campaign stands this year. The story of what is done with the moneys given on Poppy Day? This is in fact the whole story of the British Legion’s welfare and benevolent services. It is a story rich in variety and interest. Yet it is remarkable how many to-day—after 26 years of our Appeal—still do not understand that men and women of all Ser vices—the Army, Navy, A i r Force, and their Auxiliary Ser vices—and the Merchant Navy —are entitled to help from the British Legion. Whether they are members of the Legion or not is quite by the way. It is re markable too how many still think that it is the seriously dis abled only who are helped through Haig’s Fund. Quantities Available We would like to stress the importance of supplement ing from local sources the supplies which will be sent from Headquarters. This parti cularly applies to Overseas Or ganisers as, with the best will in the world, it may not be possi ble for us to get supplies of our new stocks out in sufficient time for next Poppy Day. Printing delays are considerable. We shall do our best. So please explore local re sources where you can. You have in this Supplement all de tails required to produce locally posters, window bills, and hand bills similar basically to those you will receive from Head quarters.

We need &gt;an extensive and carefully planned publicity cam paign to support our Poppy Day Appeal. Publicity in most forms unfortunately requires paper.

It is because of this that we are bringing our publicity plan to the attention of Poppy Day Organisers now.

The sug gestion now is that good friends of the Appeal may be found who are in a position to produce pos ters and leaflets for you locally at little or no cost to the Appeal. Printers are friendly people- even to-day—and the ex-Service cause has many good supporters amongst them. The Approach to the Public But firstly, the general prin ciples and the method of ap proach. For too long now the man in the street has regarded the Poppy Day Appeal as some thing which “just happens.” If he thinks of the Appeal at all, he regards it as “an institution”— something which does not re quire, or does not want, his active interest. Because it means money—big money—to us, we must do our utmost to correct this impres sion. We want—above all else— a lively public interest in the Poppy Day Appeal and what it enables the British Legion to do for ex-Service people. Our pub licity programme this year is in tended primarily to make the public itself aware that this is our need. The function of our Appeal Organisation, both nationally and locally, is to provide the public with the opportunity to give on Poppy Day. Public readiness to give, and the extent of public generosity, depend pri marily on its knowledge of, and regard for, the cause which it is being asked to support. It is the function of “publicity” to provide that knowledge and so influence public opinion that it will be sympathetic to the ex-Service cause. Poppy Day is the Public’s Day So, to counter the “Poppy Day is something which happens” theory we base our publicity this year on the principle that “Poppy Day is the Public’s Day.” It started that way in 1921. But it would seem that the Poppy Day organisation itself—and certainly the public—is over looking this fact to-day. To-day —this year—it is vitally neces sary that British people should be made to recognise to the full their responsibility to the mil lion who still suffer as a iS^lt of the 1914/1918 war, and touche added millions who now suffer as a result of service given faith fully to their country in the second world war of this century. For the public to recognise its responsibility is the first essen tial. The second essential is that the man in the street should be satisfied that the best and hap piest method of acknowledging his responsibility is still the 26- year-old Poppy Day Appeal. To do this he must have the oppor tunity of knowing what is done with the money which he is asked to give. “Poppy Day is the Public’s Day” if only be cause it is public money which is collected that day. Whilst very many people re main ignorant—and they are extraordinarily ignorant—about the purpose of our Appeal and the true use made of tf^eir money, it is wishful think ing to expect them to “Give Generously.” We must get at them. Important CHANGE OF ADDRESS All readers are asked to note that Poppy Day Headquarters changes its address in approximately a month’s time. For purposes of the local production of posters, handbills, etc., it is therefore essen tial that the address shown in the illustra tions on this sheet should be amended to read: British Legion Appeal (Haig’s Fund), 26, Eccleston Square, London, S.W.I, 'FOPPY POST HOW IT WAS DONE-AT HOME We publish below extracts from Organisers' own stories of the planning of local Popp/ Day Appeals last year. These selections are published for the value of the suggestions made, rather than because of results achieved, though the soundness of the principles outlined was proved by record collections taken last Poppy Day. Will Organisers please continue to send their stories of “ How it was done,' and of “ How it will be done' too! Space does not permit fuller treatment in this issue, but please make your stories as long as you think fit. Information regarding local plans is of the greatest value to us for a number of purposes. T)ECENTRALISATION is the Secret of Success, says Barking, Essex. . . . In his first year as Poppy Day Organiser Mr. C. J. Hampton raised the Harking Poppy Day collection from £401 to £698 and in doing so left the previous record figure of £551 lengths behind. j'm the very beginning,” he &amp;Jys, “I found that the best way to work was to arouse the interest of as many other organi sations and groups of people as possible, and I may safely say that any success I have had is due entirely to the splendid way in which everyone co-operated with me.” Mr. Hampton began by obtain ing from the Town Hall a list of all organisations in the Borough, ranging from the W.V.S. to the Allotment Holders’ Association, and including Churches, charitable organisa tions, political parties and social clubs. He wrote inviting each to elect a representative to the Poppy Day Committee, which in cluded members of the Branch and the Women’s Section of the Legion. Once again Mr. Hampton w r ro^^) every organisation and group of people in the Borough, asking them to take over a small part of the district, to assume re sponsibility for the Poppy Day collection in their sections, to find collectors and sellers, to re-distribute supplies of Poppies and to return filled collecting tins to his headquarters for bank ing. All organisations accepted an Area matching their capa bilities and Mr. Hampton divided the Borough into dis tricts ranging in size from a street corner to a whole ward. Decentralisation was carried right the way through Mr. Hampton’s plan of operations. Three Fields of Remembrance, for instance, were managed by those responsible for the ground in which they were opened. One Field in the Park was attended and staffed by Park-keepers. There is just one thing Mr. Hampton does himself! “I do make myself responsible,” he says, ‘‘for supplying the fac tories and for collecting their tins in afterwards. In this way I ensure that all important em ployers are contacted and given the opportunity of arranging a sale of Poppies in their works.” •THE PERSONAL TOUCH is all- ‘ important, says Captain R. Charlton, Newcastle ■ on &gt; Tyne Organiser, whose collection of £6,200 last year was a new high record. . . . “We go all out for the per sonal touch—for making some one person responsible for his or her own little area or com munity,” explains Captain Charl ton. And that is the note running right through Captain Charlton’s story of Newcastle’s Poppy Day organisation—personal contact, an early beginning, a systematic breakdown of the total area into sfub-sections, and the distribu tion of w.orkers to the greatest benefit of the area as a whole. “It has been our practice to commence Poppy Day organisa tion at the beginning of August,” says Captain Charlton. “We have a comprehensive list of everyone who assisted the previous year. These ladies and gentlemen are written to indi vidually, asked if they are pre pared to help again, and in what district they would prefer to work.” “Meantime, I have split the City into sections, the outskirts being known as sub-sections, and the responsibility for Poppy Day organisation there placed in the hands of the local Legion Branch and the Women’s Sec tion. The centre of the City is split into blocks, each controlled by one lady who has her own workers. It is to these ladies that I distribute the volunteers who have replied to my earlier letter.” The first big planning meeting is held at the beginning of Sep tember. Here representatives from the sub-sections state their requirements and reveal their plan of action. “This is a very jolly and informal affair where officials of sub-sections get to gether and talk to each other,” explains Captain Charlton. “We always find this meeting very helpful.” Sound co-operation and the pooling of ideas is evi dent in Newcastle. There is team work, obviously, and the fine re sult declares it. Newcastle’s Quayside firms are a big feature of its business life. “Some years ago our late organ iser started a scheme for raising money amongst these firms,” ex plains Captain Charlton. “A per sonal friend agreed to form a Committee and circularise every firm connected with the Quay side. This small Committee has 'worked .ever since, each year breaking the previous year’s record. The same thing is done by Members of the Green Market and Produce Exchange and by the Brewers of the City.” A TESTING YEAR calls for ^ TESTED METHODS— sums up much sound advice sent by Captain C. R. Garforth-Bles, Organiser for Bideford, on the North Coast of Sunny Devon. . . . Sufficient foresight will always produce the answer to a prob lem! That looks like one of Bide ford’s reasons for success. From 1927 to 1943 the annual Poppy Day collection averaged £196. From 1944 to 1946 the average was £628! Captain Garforth-Bles stresses the canvassing of merchants, lawyers, builders, estate agents, factories, shops, etc., for dona tions. “This should be started four to five weeks before Poppy Day by personal visits from the Organiser,” he says. “Circular letters are useless. This personal visit, in my opinion, is the most important factor in the campaign. It gives a solid foundation and, to a great extent, neutralises the dangers of loss through the vagaries of November weather in the actual sale of Poppies.” The Field of Remembrance is rightly stressed, too, by Bideford. “It should be made a paramount feature of the Poppy Day cam paigns, and should be opened by some prominent member of the Community—the Mayor, a senior officer in one of the Services— serving or retired—or even by a cadet—so as to bring it to the greater notice of the Youth of the town. The Field should be dedi cated by the Mayor’s Chaplain if opened by the Mayor, other wise, by the Rector, or Vicar or Chaplain to the Legion.” Regarding the internal collec tions, Captain Garforth-Bles ad vises the personal canvassing of schools, hotels, factories, but not shops. “I have found a remark able readiness to accept collect ing tins,” he says, “but why I stress that shops should not' be included is because—(1) if we give to some we should give to all—and that is impossible. (2) It interferes with the work of the shop on a Saturday morning— Market Day in Bideford. (3) It would necessarily detract from the takings of our own street col lections an.d thus lessen the en thusiasm of, and friendly rivalry between, collectors.” The Poppy Day Committee? It should be “strongly enthusiastic and representative of all classes and denominations,” advises Bideford. Publicity? Very important And the right approach to the public is all-important, as Cap tain Garforth-Bles wisely illus trates when saying, “I have not only tried to get away from the stereotyped ‘Appeal’ letters, but have also tried to impress all readers that to give to the Poppy Day Appeal is not an act of Charity but an act of Gratitude and Thanksgiving.” The public of to-day, in particular, needs telling that—and it needs repeat ing in the interests of our Poppy Day Appeal. m SINESS METHODS is the KEY, says Mr. F. G. Davis, Poppy Day Organiser for Green wich, London. . . . “It is my opinion,” he says, “that, in an industrial Borough such as Greenwich, street sales are always likely to prove a dif ficulty owing to the shortage of sellers, particularly in view of the appeal to married women to return to work. I therefore con sidered the possibilities of con tacting the public at work and at play, obtained a list of fac tories and works in the Borough, and circulated a letter, which w r as signed by the Mayor, asking firms to organise sales in their premises. The response was most gratifying, £195 17s. 8d. be ing raised by this method alone. Mr. Davis is anxious to stress one point—an important one. Although the w 7 hole area is divided into seven districts under separate Depot Organisers, these depot organisers are responsible for street sales only. The work of distributing supplies to in dustry is dealt with by a central organisation. The same method is used for supplying clubs, hos pitals, public houses, a complete list of which w r as obtained from the Secretary of the Licensed Victuallers’ Association, and the schools, permission having been obtained from the local Educa tion Officer. An interesting method of covering the sale of Poppies in the Railway Company premises has been established through the good offices of a member of the Branch who is also a railway official. Supplies of Poppies were sent to the three railway stations situated within the Borough and the sale was made by the rail way staff to their own members and to the public, Mr. Davis thus demonstrating how he makes the best of his local resources. Two Fields of Remembrance in Greenwich are very w r ell sup ported by the public. In 1946 the experiment w’as tried of dividing the plot into sections commemorating Royal Navy, Army, Royal Air Force, and Air Raids. This last innovation ap peared to fill a great need as there were over 200 crosses in remembrance of Air Raid Victims in one Field alone.4 POPPY POST HOW IT WAS DONE-OVERSEAS POPPY DAY SUCCESS IN MALAYA Nothing x Enthusiasm = £17,000 No previous records—no experience—no supplies—no pins—and no time! That was the situation which confronted Lady Guerdolen Gent, Wife of the Governor of the Malayan Union and Poppy Day Organiser for the whole of the Union, on her arrival in far away Kuala Lumpur late last August. Not the kindest of introductions for one who, on the voyage out, was already “ somewhat alarmed to be told that, as Wife of the Governor, one of my first duties would be to organise the Poppy Day Fund collection throughout the Union. This was certainly very rapid promotion for one who previously had never been more than a unit in the vast number of street Poppy Day Sellers ! ” T&gt;UT what Lady Gent, the Wives of the Resident Com- /niissioners, and the Ladies of the Malayan Women’s Associa tions lacked in experience and supplies, they more than made up for in enthusiasm. Out of nothing, in short time, they created a Union Poppy Day Appeal Organisation, finally succeeded—against considerable odds—in raising the fine total on Poppy Day last year of £16,965. On arrival Lady Gent first con sidered the future Poppy Day with the Malayan Ex-Services’ Association, and discovered that the Japanese occupation had caused the loss of all records. The direct result of this loss was the non-arrival, through incorrect address, of a cable sent at that moment to Poppy Day Headquarters in England, ask ing for supplies of Poppies and publicity material to be imme diately despatched to the Penin sula. It was not until later—and too late—that Lady Gent dis covered that this cable had not reached its destination. Following the first meeting, Wives of Resident Commissioners undertook the Poppy Day organi sation in each State and Settle ment and set up their Commit tees in Areas and Localities. Things were moving. But not until late in September was first contact made with London Head quarters, and it was learnt that no Poppy supplies would arrive in time for the Malayan Appeal. What happened next, Lady Gent describes in her own. story —“Hasty consultations took place and it was decided that the only thing to be done was to have emblems printed locally. An order was placed for 100,000 card board Poppies. The next snag was to find pins for these em blems in a country that was still deplorably short of many of the essentials, let alone the unessen tials of life, such as pins. Some were finally run to earth in Singapore, but the price was ex- horbitant—$13 a pound! The Government Printing Depart ment came to our aid, however, by punching holes and putting loops of string in. the emblems. A big task, very cheerfully un dertaken by the employees, many of whom volunteered to work on Sunday in order to get the number completed in time.” Lady Gent had still hoped that supplies from England would arrive in time for the real Pop Tire Ladies of the Malayan Women’s Association making Poppies by hand. Malayan Government Official printing Poppy Day Posters. pies to be used for Wreath mak ing, but even this hope had to be abandoned and substitutes found. “After much searching red and black material was found, and the Malayan Women’s Associations in various places undertook to make it into large Poppies,” said Lady Gent. “Arti ficial flower making is an art in which Malay women excel. Enough, however, could not be made in the time, and a further supply in red paper was made by a Chinese firm.” The whole of the distribution of emblems and Poppies had still to be done. Communications to some of the States were very difficult. But, with the help of a number of ladies who came to King’s House daily, all supplies were despatched just in time— Singapore receiving its supply onlv the day before the collec tion! Referring to the hard work and enthusiasm of so many people, Lady Gent described how “one District Officer heard that all the Poppies supplied to his district had been sold before the Appeal Day to the school children. After his' day’s work he drove to Kuala Lumpur for fresh supplies—a two-hour journey over winding roads through the jungle, roads in very poor condition which had, not long before, been the haunt of gangsters who special ised in holding up cars. A short rest and he started on the return journey, arriving back in his own town at midnight with the Peppies. “A variety of entertainments were held in the various towns to help swell the Fund,” said Lady Gent. These included balls, dances, concerts, cinema shows, football matches and country fairs. Our thanks go to the will ing workers who organised these events, as well as to the Organ isers and Committees of the States and Settlements, and all other innumerable helpers who made the grand result possible.” After four years of Japanese occupation and plunder Lady Gent and her Committees felt hardly justified in making a big drive for the Poppy Day Appeal, but decided to do their best to make a fitting contribution. “So, when the final figure of £16,965 was announced, all con cerned were delighted and felt that their work and worry hj,'' been well worth while.’ Issued by the BRITISH LEGION APPEAL (HAIG’S FUND), Lansdowne Lodge, Petersham Road, Richmond, Surrey./ Ml- Patron: WS MAJESTY THE KING.

This leaflet is the Information Leaflet referred to in 'Emphasis on Publicity.” Whilst it does tell the story of what is done with the Poppy Day collection, its primary purpose, as will be clear from the last para graph, is to assist you in persuading particular people, Associations, Clubs^nd Societies, and such like, of the need to give all possible active support to your Local Appeal. In order not to disappoint you later, I wou^d suggest now that, if you think fit, you make immediate arrangements to have quantities of this leaflet printed locally. Owing to the paper supply situation, I much regret I cannot promise to get any quantity out to you in reasonable time for the November Appeal. As suggested in 'Emphasis on Publicity,” you may be fortunate enough +o find sympathetic Printers who will reproduce it for you, at little cost, as their means of giving to your Appeal. But if not, you and^your Committee will be able to decide how much can justifiably be spent on printing locally. Regarding supplies of Poppies for you^if you have not already done so, would you please send me your order just as soon as possible. 'f’ime is already short, and transport delays are still considerable to many par+s of the world. If it is your inten+ion to organise your Appeal locally without the use of Poppies, would you kindly give me confirmation of this fact. Finally, you will I know, be glad to hear that the total collections for Poppy Day, 1946, will probably close at £975,000 approximately. This figure, which exceeds our earlier expectations, should be a source of great satisiaction to our world-wide Organisation. T hope it will be a source of enconravem ent also, b ecause the British Legion is now dispensing money on Ex-Service Welfare at,'the rate of over' £1,000,000 annually. Expenditure is, in fact, outstrip- oinc Poppy Day in come for the first, time in the hi story or the Appeal. It was with this knowledge in mind that we planned the enclosed leaflet, and decided that we must, above all else, urge British people everywhere to accept their responsibility to Ex-Service people, and to recognise the Poppy Day Appeal as their chosen method of ’remembering generously.’ With best wishes, Yours sincerely. xNo. 3334-16/48.

After one of the mildest of British Winters and with Spring again in the air, I write to send you our warmest thanks for all that you did for the 194? Poppy Day Appeal, and to express the sincere hope that you will assume the responsibility for our 1948 Appeal. Poppy Day 1948 is on Saturday, 6th November, and the next 'day, Sunday, is this year's Remembrance Day. Regarding the 194? Appeal, hopes ran very high at one time for a new record collection. First reports immediately after Poppy Day from all over the country told us of new record collections locally and there was sound hope for believing that the £1,008,000 of 1945, still the highest ever, would be exceeded. It is still true to say that Poppy Day collections have generally increased and at the moment of writing it is touch and go to the £1,000,000. Our National Account, up to the end of February, shows us to be over £12,000 ahead of 1946 at the same period. The Overseas total to the same date is £66,298 as compared with £60,674 in 1946. 7/e have been much encouraged and very delighted by these magnificent results for Overseas Poppy Day collections. In these difficult times it is good to be able to speak of an increase at all and. excellent to be able to record such splendid figures. We certainly cannot thank the Exchange rates for them! '''he credit indeed goes to our Poppy Day Organisers and Committees Overseas who have worked so splendidly and have succeeded in stimulating a response of such great value to the Appeal. Our deepest gratitude to you all. and especiall 3 r I send you and all those who helped you, our warmest thanks for your part in promoting our cause. You will have read elsewhere already of the fact that the British Legion’s welfare expenditure in 194? outstripped Poppy Day income for the first time in the history of our Appeal. In the year ending September 30th, 194?, over £1,250,000 was dispensed on ex-Service benevolent and welfare work. This statement in itself makes it abundantly clear that the need for our ^oppy Day Appeal grows no less, and the £1,250,000 expenditure includes, of course, the usual annual grants we make to other ex-Service Organisations - £43,000 was granted to St. Dunstan’s - and the discovery of ways and means to bridge the gap between expenditure and income becomes more urgent. LONDON, 8.W.I. Ref: 0/7. 6th, April, 194-8. contd.Our 1948 Poppy Day Appeal is, therefore, being planned with the greatest sense of urgency and with a proper appreciation of the difficulties with which we are faced. Material supplies at home are not good. We have decided, as a measure of economy, and because we feel that the price notation attached to our Poppies may be harmful to our Appeal, to produce two types of buttonhole Poppies only. These will be known as the large and the small Poppy and will replace the old ^d, 6d and ]/-d types. T feel that there is very little real guidance I can give Overseas Organisers; circumstances are so different and to attempt to advise without real knowledge of local conditions would be presumptuous. In this country we encourage the promotion of a full Remembrance Week immediately prior to Remembrance Day, but overseas it may well be that the raising of money is easier at some other time of the year. For example, if the Summer produces a flood of tourists in your district, it is clearly at that time that you may want to organise events in support of Haig’s Fund. I do not, therefore, want you to feel tied to Remembrance Week and would rather leave it to your discretion to select the appropriate methods and times for the organisation of special events. We look forward at all times to letters from our Overseas Organisers and they are always read with great interest. T hope, in particular, you will not hesitate to criticize our service. It may be for instance that the publicity material we send is not appropriate for general overseas' use. I enclose your order form for this year’s Appeal end it would be of great assistance to us - and incidental~ly to you — if yon v /ould complete tnis and return it as soon nossjble The Shipping Companies who so generously give us freight free passage all over the World are still subject to many endless dela.ys bevond their control. Hence we need to start despatching very early to ensure arrival of supplies in good time. You believe, as we do, that it is our responsibility to care for those who served us so selflessly in War. It is for this reason that I invite you to give us - and them — the benefit of your time and energy in organising your 1948 Poppy Day Appeal. Your request for Poppies contained in your letter of the 22nd December last is receiving our attention and I will communicate with you further confirming the despatch. Meanwhile I felt you would wish to receive this our first letter in connection with this year's appeal. Yours very truly,This leaflet gives the story of the Legion’s welfare and benevolent service financed by Poppy Day* Supplies may be useful to send out; for example, with a letter inviting personal donations to your Appeal, Please sbate separately the quantities required for this oi* any other purpose* (The leaflet referred to in the order form will cover our other publication 'WORK, HOMES, HEALTH, PEACE.' )The British people have In 1921 the British people raised £100,000 to start one national welfare fund for all ex- Service men and women and their dependants. It was called Haig’s Fund, and administered by the British Legion. Each year since, on behalf of the Nation, and sustained by the annual Appeal, the British Legion has administered a welfare organization unparalleled in the world. Its help and advice is immediately available to all ex-Service people (including Merchant Navy), all families and dependants, all widows and children of those killed in action. To-day the Legion dispenses over £ 1 , 000,000 a year This is how the British people have chosen to remember—by a great national Living Memorial expressed in four simple words—WORK, HOMES, HEALTH, PEACE. WORK The Legion constantly pursues a reasonable preference in employment for ex-Service people, based on equality of opportunity. A Joint Committee of the Legion and the Trade Union Congress has been set up to dis cuss matters of common interest affecting ex-Service men and women. Negotiations and co-operation with the Ministry of Labour and National Service are gaining employment for thousands of ex- Service men and women (over 16,000 in 1946 alone). In this way, too, fuller training facilities have been secured for the demobilized. Important arrangements with Trade Associations have been concluded whereby Service trades men are enabled to use their experience to enter civil occupations. The Legion Business Advice Service safeguards gratuities and hard-earned savings from rasj^ investment. Business loans are made available to those wishing to start on their own, and financial assistance is given for the purchase of necessary tools and equipment. Work for the Disabled has always been a special care of the British Legion. Striving to give them a purpose in life and a living wage, the Legion has for many years advocated training and subsequent compulsory employment in industry. The Government has now accepted this prin ciple under the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act, which requires employers to take on a percentage of disabled persons. The Legion itself is the greatest employer of disabled in the world. It runs the Poppy Factory, employing 400 , a Cambrian Tweed Factory, a Furniture Factory, a national car jliw 1 bnB ‘iuo TTTvT^TT't 9XixiwflB9M .riosiM gni fTilaoo ‘isrid'ijj'l jjov; rMiw 9so 1 ni/Tr ■ 09 ds'iil ido ovionoT od ilsiv; fcluow uO '4 dlTi I .leaqqe eirM d 3 i 1 aoij’ooi.aoothis LIVING MEMORIAL park attendants company operating in seventy centres, and the Disabled Men’s Industries for those so badly crippled that they can only work at home.

Financial assistance is given to meet rents and pay for removals. Legion Haig Homes, some 200 dwellings in various centres, provide houses and flats at fecial rentals for the disabled and for widows. The special housing scheme for the part- paralysed is being extended.

Throughout Britain are country homes where invalid and aged ex-Service men and women can live, and convalescent homes providing rest and convalescence for shorter periods. Special medical schemes for the paralysed and for those suffering from psycho-neurosis and other diseases are being rapidly extended. Special schemes exist, too, for the medical care of wives and children. Invalid chairs, artificial limbs and warm clothing required by invalids are also provided for those in need. PEACE The greatest need of all of those who have suffered in war is peace of mind. To give this back to ex-Service men and women by helping them through the difficult period of re-adjust- ment is an unswerving purpose of the British Legion. The Legion’s work for the sick and the home less has been described above. In a much wider sphere, the Legion has achieved out standing results in its fight for pensions. The Legion is currently fighting over 100,000 cases where claims for pensions for war dis ability have been refused by the Ministry of Pensions. By obtaining pensions formerly refused, the British Legion has already secured to the ex- Service community the remarkable sum of £ 9 , 000 , 000 . The Legion itself grants weekly pensions to several thousand ex-Service veterans to assist them in their old age. To the young, the Legion strives to give en couragement and a purpose on their return to civilian life. Its many educational aid schemes include residential summer courses at eighteen Univer sities and University Colleges; a taxi-drivers school in London, aid for candidates for ordina tion, and the training of sons of ex-Service men in farm work.WHY THE NEED IS GREATER THAN EVER 1. A second world war has presented the British Legion with new problems and new demands. Six and a hall million men and women served in H.M. Forces during 1939 — 45 . Every one, on demobilization, becomes entitled if in need to the assistance of the Legion. 2. Many men of the 1914—18 war, in addition to the veterans of earlier campaigns, are now at an age when they can no longer be expected to fend successfully for themselves. They must become an increasing liability—and one that the British Legion must never fail to meet. 3. To-day the annual cost of the nation’s Living Memorial exceeds the annual income from Haig’s Fund.

(13th April,1948) ( Ref: 0/7. H.B.M. Political Agent, Bahrain, The Political Agency, Bahrain, Persian 0-ulf. 6th, April, 1948. Dear Sir, After one of the mildest of British Winters and with Spring again in the air, I write to send 3 ^ou our warmest thanks for 9,11 that you did for the 1947 Poppy Day Appeal, and to express the sincere hope that you will assume the responsibilitjr for our 1948 Appeal. ^ Poppy Day 1948 is on Saturday, 6 th N ovember . an &amp; the next day, Sunday - , Ts this year's Re'membrance DayT .3 Regarding the 1947 Appeal, hopes ran very high at one time' &gt;for a new record collection. First reports immediately after 1 Poppy Day from a!«l over the country told us of new record collections locally and there was sound hope for believing that the £1,008,000 of 1945, still the highest ever, would be exceeded. It is still true to say that Poppy Day collections have generally increased and at the moment of writing it is touch and go to the £1,000,000. Our National Account, up to the end of February, shows us to be over £12,000 ahead of 1946 at the same period. The Overseas total to the same date is £66,298 as compared with £60,674 in 1946. ty* We have been much encouraged and very delighted by these magnificent results for Overseas Poppy Day collections. In these difficult times it is good to be able to speak of an increase at all and excellent to be able to record such splendid figures. We certainly cannot thank the Exchange rates for them! ^he credit indeed goes to our Poppy Day Organisers and Committees Overseas who have worked so splendidly and have succeeded in stimulating a response of such great value to the Appeal. Our deepest gratitude to you all. and especially I send, you and all those who helped you, our warmest thanks for your part in promoting our cause. You will have read elsewhere already of the fact that the British Legion’s welfare expenditure in 1947 outstripped Popp]^ Day income for the first time in the history of our Appeal. In the year ending September 50th, 194?, over £1,250,000 was dispensed on ex-Service benevolent and welfare work. This statement in itself makes it abundantly clear that the need for our Poppy Day Appeal grows no less, and the £1,250,000 expenditure includes, of course, the usual annual grants we make to other ex-Service Organisations - £43,000 was granted to St. Dunstan’s - and the y of ways and means to bridge the gap between expenditure ne becomes more urgent.Our 1948 Poppy Day Appeal is, therefore, being planned with the greatest sense of urgency and with a proper appreciation of the difficulties with which we are faced. Material supplies at home are not good. We have decided, as a measure of economy, and because we feel that the price notation attached to our Poppies may be harmful to our Appeal, to produce two types of buttonhole Poppies only. These will be known as the large and the small Poppy and will replace the old 3d, 6d and l/-d types. I feel that there is very little real guidance I can give Overseas Organisers; circumstances are so different and^to attempt to advise without real knowledge of local conditions would be presumptuous. In this country we encourage the promotion of a full Remembrance Week immediately prior to Remembrance Day, but overseas -n it may well be that the raising of money is easier at some other time of the year. For example, if the Summer produces a flood of tourists in your district, it is clearly at that time that 3 T ^u may want to organise events in support of Haig’s Fund. I do not, therefore, want you to feel tied to Remembrance Week and would rather leave it to your discretion to select the appropriate methods and times for the organisation of special events. We look forward at all times to letters from our Overseas Organisers and they are always read with great interest. T hope, in particular, you will not hesitate to criticize our service. It may be for instance that the publicity material we send is not appropriate for general overseas' use. I enclose your order form for this year's Appeal end it would be of grea t a ssistance to us - and inci dentally to you — if you would complete thi s and return it as soon as possible . The Shipping Companies who so generously give us freight free passage all X over the World are still subject to many endless delays beyond their control. Hence we need to start despatching very early to ensure arrival of supplies in good time. You believe, as we do, that it is our responsibility to^care for those who served us so selflessly in War. It is for this reason that I invite you to give us - and them - the benefit of your time and energy in organising your 1948 Poppy Day Appeal.

The British Legion has organised this Overseas Wreath Laying Service in co-operation with the three Service departments and with the Imperial War Graves Commission, k is hoped that the Service may be extended gradually to other countries overseas, and those interested in placing Wreaths on War Graves in such countries are invited to write to the British Legion Appeal Department. By so doing they will materially assist the British Legion in its efforts to provide the best possible service. ISSUED BY THE BRITISH LEGION, PALL MALL, LONDON. All enquiries to : BRITISH LEGION APPEAL DEPARTMENT 26. ECCLESTON SQUARE, LONDON, S.W 1THE WREATH LAYING SERVICE The British Legion has now completed arrangements under which orders can be accepted for Wreaths to be placed on any War Grave (1914-18 or 1939-45) in the following Countries :— This Wreath Laying Service is available to all who may wish to use it. The organisation has been established to serve the interests of the British public and close relatives, in particular, may rest assured that they will be given a careful and tactful personal service on writing to the Organising Secretary, British has been laid on the Grave overseas and a report on the condition of the Grave and the Cemetery will be sent direct from the Brussels Office of the British Legion. So far as concerns British War Graves in GERMANY, Wreath Orders can be dealt with in respecv of any listed War Cemetery (1914-18 or 1939-45) in any Zone, with the exception for the time being of the Russian Zone. Wreath Depots established in the British Zone serve the undermentioned Cemeteries in Germany :— SERVICE AND EX-SERVICE UNITS. Whilst primarily intending to serve the interests of the individual relative of the War Casualty buried overseas, the British Legion also offers a special facility to Service and ex-Service organisations— Regimental Associations, Old Comrades Associations, etc.—consisting of the placing, on Battle anniversaries, of Regimental Wreaths or Crosses at overseas Cemeteries where a number of Graves of War Casualties of the Regiment have been grouped. * THE WREATH. The War Grave Laurel and Poppy Wreath offered is illustrated on the front page of this leaflet. Its size balances with the size of the official Cross placed at the Head of all British War Graves. The price of the Wreath is 15/- inclusive of all costs of despatch and of placing on the Grave overseas. All Poppy Wreaths supplied are made by severely disabled ex-Service men of the 1914-18 and 1939-45 Wars at the British Legion Poppy Factory, Richmond, Surrey. PHOTOGRAPHIC SERVICE.

It was called Haig’s Fund, and admmisteret^ by the British Legion. Each year since, on behalf of the Nation, and sustained by the annual Appeal, the British Legion has administered a welfare organization unparalleled in the world. Its help and advice is immediately available to all ex-Service people (including Merchant Navy), all families and dependants, all widows and children of those killed in action. To-day the Legion dispenses over £ 1 , 000,000 a year This is how the British people have chosen to remember—by a great national Living Memorial expressed in four simple words—WORK, HOMES, HEALTH, PEACE. WORK The Legion constantly pursues a reasonable preference in employment for ex-Service people, based on equality of opportunity. A Joint Committee of the Legion and the Trade Union Congress has been set up to dis cuss matters of common interest affecting ex-Service men and women. Negotiations and co-operation with the Ministry of Labour and National Service are gaining employment for thousands of ex- Service men and women (over 16,000 in 194 b alone). In this way, too, fuller training facilities have been secured for the demobilized. Important arrangements with Trade Associations have been concluded whereby Service trades men are enabled to use their experience to enter civil occupations. The Legion Business Advice Service safeguards gratuities and hard-earned savings from rash investment. Business loans are made available to those wishing to start on their own, and financ^ assistance is given for the purchase of necessary tools and equipment. Work for the Disabled has always been a special care of the British Legion. Striving to give them a purpose in life and a living wage, the Legion has for many years advocated training and subsequent compulsory employment in industry. The Government has now accepted this prin ciple under the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act, which requires employers to take on a percentage of disabled persons. The Legion itself is the greatest employer of disabled in the world. It runs the Poppy Factory, employing 400 , a Cambrian Tweed Factory, a Furniture Factory, a national carpark attendants company operating in seventy centres, and the Disabled Men’s Industries for ^hose so badly crippled that they can only work at home. HOMES Housing authorities throughout the country are pressed to grant a reasonable preference for ex-Service people. House purchase loans are made available to ex-Service people. Financial assistance is given to meet rents and pay for removals. Legion Haig Homes, some 200 dwellings in various centres, provide houses and flats at special rentals for the disabled and for widows. The special housing scheme for the part- paralysed is being extended. HEALTH Preston Hall, Kent; Nayland Hall, Essex; and Douglas House, Bournemouth, form the largest centre in the world for the treatment, training and employment of tubercular ex-Service men and women. Throughout Britain are country homes where invalid and aged ex-Service men and women can live, and convalescent homes providing rest and convalescence for shorter periods. Special medical schemes for the paralysed and for those suffering from psycho-neurosis and other diseases are being rapidly extended. Special schemes exist, too, for the medical care of wives and children. Invalid chairs, artificial limbs and warm clothing required by invalids are also provided for those in need. PEACE The greatest need of all of those who have suffered in war is peace of mind. To give this back to ex-Service men and women by helping them through the difficult period of re-adjust ment is an unswerving purpose of the British Legion. The Legion’s work for the sick and the home less has been described above. In a much wider sphere, the Legion has achieved out standing results in its fight for pensions. The Legion is currently fighting over 100,000 cases where claims for pensions for war dis ability have been refused by the Ministry of Pensions.

SATU RDAY NOVEMBER 8 13 The challenge is there — it is for all Local2 POPPY POST October, 1947 REMEMBRANCE WEEK \ x. i Money Raising Possibilities are The greatest hope of an appreciable increase in Poppy Day Appeal results restsHn the organisation of “ Remembrance Week.” Stress is laid on this matter in the new “Guide to Organisers” issued throughout the organisation this year, and no apology is made for emphasising the subject again here. The basis of Remembrance Week is the organisation of money-raising events of all appropriate kinds, the proceeds of which, in whole or part, are donated to the local Poppy Day Appeal collection. Remembrance Week this year will be from November 3rd to the 9th, the latter date being, of course, Remembrance Day itself. POPPY POST AND REMEMBRANCER 26, ECCLESTON SQUARE, LONDON, S.W.I. Telephone: Victoria 7661 One Day — One Week On one day in the year— Poppy Day—we ask British people to buy, wear, and “Give Generously” for Poppy emblem. It is up to all of us within the Poppy Day organisation to ensure that every man, woman and child has the opportunity of acquiring the emblem. Full opportunity can only be given if an adequate number of helpers and sellers is obtained in every community. On that fact everything depend s— eluding one of our main hopes of achieving the £1,500,000 target. ““If“we are to continue to dis charge our responsibilities to the men and women of the Second World War our income must be increased and the immediate target of £1,500,000 must be achieved.” That is our National Chairman’s statement. “Must” it is. So we emphasise once again the value and the responsibilities of Remembrance Week which is discussed in ful ler detail on this page. In Remembrance Week lies the possibility of raising an equal amount again to that collected by the public sale of the Poppy emblem and Poppy wreaths. As the day approaches reports show that confidence through out the world-wide organisation is increasing. May the sun shine! Poppy Day Petrol We have been assured by the Ministry of Fuel and Power that Regional Petroleum Officers will give sympathetic considera tion to applications for petrol by Poppy Day Organisers. Applications should be made by P.D.O.’s themselves, with the exception of those based on the Tunbridge Wells and London Petroleum Offices who should apply to Poppy Day Head quarters. Northern Ireland applications should be made to the British Legion Area Secretary, 97, North Street, Belfast. All petrol demands on Poppy Day Headquarters must be accompanied by Registration No.’s and horsepower of cars. Remembrance Week is a mat- C. ter which must depend for its success on the general goodwill of the local community toward the ex-Service cause. Its suc cess or failure will be, in part, a measure of the interest which exists locally in the welfare of the men and women who served in His Majesty’s Forces and who suffer in one way or another as a result of that ser vice. Remembrance Week can only be run by the community. Those already directly con cerned with the responsibility and administration of the Poppy Day Appeal itself—the house- to-house collection, the street sale, etc.—are so heavily com mitted that they could not be expected to organise particular money raising events at the same time. The official Poppy Day Committee or Organiser can do no more than initiate the Week by extending invitations to others to promote money raising events at the Remem brance period. It is for this reason that stress is laid on the value of “other organisations” in the “Guide to Organisers.” It is these “other organisations” who may, in fact, be expected, collectively, to create the local Remembrance Week. Who and what are these “other organisations”? Here is a list, in sections, of the types of organisations which we have in mind and most of which exist, in one form or another, in the average size town. Every local community, right down to the smallest rural district, possesses several of these “other organisations.” A. Industry and Trade. Chamber of Commerce. Chamber of Trade. Trade Associations. Professional Societies. Rotary Club. Inner Wheel, etc., etc. B Social Services. Women’s Voluntary Service. Women’s Institute. Mothers’ Union. Y.M.C.A. Girls’ Friendly Society. Young Farmers’ Clubs, etc., etc. Entertainment World. Amateur Dramatic Societies. Musical Societies. Local Cinema Clubs. Dance Clubs. Billiard Clubs. Bridge Clubs, etc., etc. D. Sports World. Football Clubs. Athletic Clubs. Motor and Cycle Clubs, etc,, etc. E. Youth Organisations. Boy Scouts. Girl Guides. Youth Auxiliary Training Services—Air Training Corps, etc. Youth Clubs, etc., etc. The list is almost endless. The types of organisations in the sections suggested here have been taken at random and every Organiser will readily be able to add his own suggestions appropriate to his local com munity. Many of these organi sations are, it can be taken for granted, sympathetic to the ex- NEWS VIEWS PICTURES — PLEASE It is hoped that Poppy Post No. 8, our Novem ber issue, will be devoted entirely to news and picture reports of our 1947 Poppy Day Appeal throughout the world. We rely on you, the local Poppy Day Organ iser, to send us any re ports you can, any pic tures and any general comment of interest, for consideration for Poppy Post. First we want news— second, pictures—third, views. Send all the facts about your local Appeal, public reaction to it, particular events organ ised, etc., etc. Poppy Post No. 8 will go to press as soon as possible after Poppy Day. How soon it is in your hands depends upon how quickly we receive a representative selection of news and pictures from the worldwide ^oppy Day Organisa tion. Service cause and the welfare, work of the British Legion.^' Every Organiser will be able to list a dozen, two dozen—or more—local organisations which have the means and facilities for promoting some social func tion to raise money for the local Appeal. There is every justi fication for inviting these organisations to take such action this year in view of the very big financial commitments of the British Legion. It is clear that each of the sections illustrated above has particular influence with specific interests and sections of the local community. For instance, the local Rotary Club, grouped in section “A,” with a membership consisting of a rep resentative of every trade and profession within the local com munity, is particularly weff^m placed to promote internal cor lections, or social functions, within factories and large in dustrial houses locally. The entertainment world again has its artistes, some of whom will offer to give their services free, or at a reduced fee, to a concert in aid of the local Appeal. The sports world holds out particularly interesting possi bilities now that Poppy Day is on a Saturday. At the least the local football Club Management might agree to a collection at its ground during the afternoon match. It might well do more by promoting a Saturday even ing- social event at the Club 'remises for the Popov Day Committee. As for the types of event to be organised, many will suggest themselves simply from con sideration of the types of organisations mentioned here. The nature of the function is finally, of course, up to the local organisation which agrees to promote a social event. But some Organisers will wisn to suggest particular functions to certain organisations or people. To these events why not add the local Firework Display on November 5th. If it is already organised, is a collection for Haig’s Fund impossible? And here is an idea which came from the Geneva Branch of the Legion—a Commemoration Ball to celebrate the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Lieut. Mountbatten. The cause is appropriate and important enough.October, 1947 POPPY POST 3 TELL YOUR SELLERS . . . It is strr'igly recommended that Poppy Day Organisers — and sub-Organisers where districts are large should arrange at lea»t one “get together” of all their helpers including sellers, a fortnight or so before Poppy Day. Those who put so mueh work voluntarily into the Poppy Day Appeal are worthy of the appreciation which can be shown at such a meeting. flTe occasion should be used especially to give all helpers the essential facts regarding the purpose and function of the Appeal. Knowing these facts a seller on the street on Poppy Day is then able to give the proper answer to the enquiring layman”—a satisfactory answer can often mean a much bigger donation. Below are given some of the more important points of information which should be known to all who help with the Appeal. 1. The Poppy is the accepted emblem of remembrance for all British war dead and is recog nised as such by British people all over the world. It is not the emblem of remembrance for the 1914-18 war alone. * * * * 2. The Poppy emblem and Poppy wreaths are all made by seriously disabled ex-Service men employed at the British Legion Poppy Factory, Rich mond, Surrey. The making of the Poppy emblem provides work to-day for nearly 350 ex- Service men who, because of their war wounds, would find it well-nigh impossible to obtain employment elsewhere. The veterans of 1914-18 at the Fac tory have already been joined by many seriously disabled men of the 1939-45 war. 3. The British public itself has, over the years, established the Poppy Day Appeal as the greatest one-day free-will offer ing in the world. No other Appeal anywhere compares with it in scale or success. The £1,000,000 mark is now the accepted standard for the Appeal. * # * * 4. All Poppy Day collections throughout the world are credited to Haig’s Fund, Lon don, which is administered by the British Legion for the benefit of all British ex-Service people. * * * * 5. Haig’s Fund is not a “charity” Fund. It is a welfare Fund created by British people as a tribute and practical memorial to those who served their country faithfully in His Majesty’s Forces. 6. Local Poppy Day Appeals are organised throughout the world—wherever there is a British community — by the voluntary worker. The adminis trative cost of this world-wide Appeal is only 4£d. for every £1 raised. The cost of the millions of poppies required works out at Is. 7d. in every £1. * * * * 7. Haig’s Fund is still to day the one and only national fund available to all ex-Service people—British men and women who have served in the Army, Navy, Air Force, their auxiliary services, and the Merchant ISfavy. Whether the individual is a member of the British Legion or not is quite immaterial. * * * * 8. Poppy Day is the public’s day. It is the day which British people all over the world origi nally adopted, at the suggestion of Earl Haig., as the occasion on which they would remember practically the debt they owe to those who gave their lives, to those who suffer as a result of service to their country, and to their dependants. * * * * 9. The need for the Poppy Day Appeal is greater than ever. The British Legion, help ing hundreds daily, is now dis pensing Haig’s Fund at the rate of over £1,000,000 annually. With increasing calls for help from ex-Service people of 1939- 45, welfare expenditure is out- stripoing Poppy Day income for the first time in the history of the Appeal. * * * * 10. Grants to other ex-Ser vice welfare organisations are made from the Poppy. Day col lection. This year the grant to St. Dunstan’s exceeded £43,000. Poppy Sellers in Railway Stations COMPANY REGULATIONS — The four main line railway companies have again promised Poppy Day Headquarters excel lent support in connection with the selling of emblems at rail- wav stations throughout the country. Railway stations rank always as No. 1 on the list of places where selling posts must be established. It is very impor tant, therefore, that all Poppy Day Organisers should be in formed as to the facilities and regulations applying to each of the main line Company s areas. Here then are the details as supplied by the London offices of the four Companies this year: The Great Western Rail way state that Poppy Day Organisers should contact their local station masters, and the same facilities for collecting which have been given in recent years will be offered. The London Midland and Scottish Railway have instruc ted their station masters in England and Wales that col lectors are to be granted facilities to sell poppies on Saturday, 8th November. This Company, however, is unable to allow collectors on to plat forms and in waiting rooms, and there may be some small additional local restrictions. The London and North Eastern Railway have granted a permit for collectors to sell poppy emblems at any of the Company’s stations in the “Southern Area.” Sellers, however, cannot be allowed on to closed platforms. The London and North Eastern Railway further request that sellers should be careful to avoid annoying or inconven iencing passengers by exer cising undue pressure in soliciting patronage. The Southern Railway ad vise all Poppy Day Organ isers to approach their local station masters. The London office has agreed to grant ffie same facilities as in previous years. With the railway companies so ready to assist the Poppy Day Appeal, it is very much hoped that all Poppy Day Organisers will be able to concentrate a sufficient number of sellers at all railway termini in their areas throughout the important hours on Poppy Day. EMPIRE FIELD of REMEMBRANCE The Empire Field of Re membrance, organised by the staff of the Poppy Factory, will be held again at Westminster this year. It will be opened at noon on Wednesday, November 5th, at a Service to be con ducted by Canon Smyth, Rec tor of St. Margaret’s, Westmin ster, assisted by the Dean of Westminster, and will remain open until the following Wed nesday evening. This year the Empire Field will revert to the pre-war plan with separate Regimental and other Memorial spaces. It is hoped that an increasing number of associations will this year adopt a space in the Field in addition to the many Regimental and other ex-Service associations with whom this is a permanent annual form of remembrance.4 POPPY POST October, 1947 Advertising Poppy Day LOCAL FIRMS CAN HELP Local Poppy Day Committees and Organisers can achieve important local publicity with the sympathetic co-operation of selected local firms who advertise in the local press. S'f suitably approached there are quite a lot of such firms who would allow spaces bought by them in the press advertise ment columns to be used to Appeal. An approach to some thou sands of firms who carry out continuous national press ad vertising campaigns is made annually by Poppy Day Head quarters. It results in thou sands of pounds worth of valu able publicity which the Appeal could not otherwise obtain. The basis of the Poppy Day Headquarters approach to the national press advertisers takes the form of an invitation to a particular firm to give spaces already booked for its own use to Haig’s Fund as the firm’s method of contributing to the Fund. When spaces are offered by the firm, Poppy Day Head quarters then supplies suitable advertising copy and a stereo of the standard poppy design. Where a firm is unable to donate complete spaces it is in vited to use poppy stereos for insertion with the copy adver tising their own product. Where a firm gives a full advertising space to the Appeal an acknow ledgment giving the name of the donor is made at the bot tom of the advertisement. This brief outline of the Poppy Day Headquarters approach to national advertisers is given because a similar method can be applied to the approach to local advertisers by local Poppy Day Committees and Organisers. Some Organ isers do already receive pub licity support in this way and the scheme is well worth while developing wherever possible. The local advertiser is, in most cases, a retail firm, place of entertainment locally, local transport service, etc., etc. How does one secure the list of the more likely local firms who are buying advertising space in local newspapers? Perusal of the local press will readily give the information in part, at least. But the Advertisement Departments of local newspaper offices, usually sympathetic to the Poppy Day Appeal, could be asked to advise and might give Organisers a list of the firms who advertise in that paper. Local newspaper adyertisement departments should, in any case, be contacted as they can help considerably. So much for the approach. What type of advertising copy should be offered to the local firm which gives a space in an publicise the local Poppy Day advertisement column to the local Appeal. On this page we reproduce a 5 inch double column Poppy Day advertise ment which gives Organisers all the information they want to enable them to supply suit able copy in their turn to local firms. The advertisment on this page is an exact reproduction of the copy now being used in advertising spaces given by British firms and already appearing in national news papers. Any local Organiser can safely suggest this type of copy to the local firm giving space. The only detail requiring amendment is, of course, the address. Loc.al Organisers would be able to insert the full address to which local people should send their offers of help. If required—it is not essential that it should be included—any number of stereos of the poppy design at the head of the adver tisement can be supplied from Poppy Day Headquarters. More Poppy Days Overseas 93 Countries Sent Poppies With British communities overseas gradually re-establish ing themselves after the up heaval of war, an increase in the number of Poppy'Day Appeals is reported this year. Supplies of poppies have, in the last few months, been sent to no less than 60 foreign countries and 33 British possessions through out the world. Nearly 200 separate Poppy Day Appeals will take place overseas — in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America. Amongst the European coun tries are Czechoslovakia, Fin land, Portugal, and Roumania. British communities holding Poppy Days in Asiatic coun tries include those in Afghanis tan, Trans-Jordan, China, and the Philippine Islands. In Africa there will be Appeals in the Belgian Congo, Cape Verde Islands, Morocco, Tunisia, and other countries. 17 South American countries will also see the Poppy in their streets; included amongst them Mexico, Haiti, Peru and Guatemala. Consignments of poppies simi lar to those worn in Britain have been sent many thousands of miles by sea and air to such far-away places as Cocos Island, Fiji, Peking, Ascension Island, and Seychelles.

Poppy Day at Sea. British shipping companies are again giving invaluable sup port to Haig’s Fund by carry ing nearly all these overseas supplies freight free on their ships. Many ocean liners, oil tan kers, and other cargo ships have requested and been supplied with poppies so that they may be worn by passengers and crews at sea on Remembrance Day. Collections for Haig’s Fund will also be taken on many other ships. Poppies to Overseas Troops. Special arrangements have been made again this year to supply all units of His Majesty’s Forces overseas with sufficient poppies for every member of each unit. The Royal Navy is taking supplies on board His Majesty’s ships which will be at sea on Poppy Day. 1946 Totals Overseas. Enthusiasm for the Poppy Day Appeal runs as high as ever amongst British people far away from homes. Last year the grand total of approximately £93,000 was raised amongst overseas British units. To this figure can be added £12,500 appi’oximately, the total con tributed by overseas Service units. The fine figure of £93,000 was achieved in suite of the ban on any street sale which applies in many foreign countries. The Poppy Day collection is made mostly on private premises, at church services, and as the re sult of concerts, sporting events, garden parties, and sales of produce. Total collections raised in each of the continents overseas in 1946 were as follows:— Europe, £15,544; Asia, £36,580; Africa, £19,160; America, £20,682; Oceania, £900. HOW SHALL A GREAT PEOPLE REMEMBER ? In remembrance of its fallen, a nation finds strength in unity. In the manner of their remembrance, a people shall know their own greatness. Through the welfare organisation of the British Legion, the British people have chosen a Living Memorial of Work, Homes, Health, Peace, available to all ex-Service men and women in need, their dependants, and the widows and child ren of those who fell.

BRITISH LEGION APPEAL (HAIG'S FUND) REMEMBRANCE WEEK Money Raising Possibilities are Big The greatest hope of an appreciable increase in Poppy Day Appeal results rests in the organisation of “ Remembrance Week.” Stress is laid on this matter in the new “Guide to Organisers” issued throughout the organisation this year, and no apology is made for emphasising the subject again here. The basis of Remembrance Week is the organisation of money-raising events of all appropriate kinds, the proceeds of which, in whole or part, are donated to the local Poppy Day Appeal collection. Remembrance Week this year will be from November 3rd to the 9th, the latter date being, of course, Remembrance Day itself. 26, ECCLESTON SQUARE, LONDON, S.W.I. Telephone: Victoria 7661 One Day — One Week On one day in the year— Poppy Day—we ask British people to buy, wear, and “Give Generously” for Poppy emblem. It is up to all of us within the Poppy Day organisation to ensure that every man, woman and child has the opportunity of acquiring the emblem. Full opportunity can only be given if an adequate number of helpers and sellers is obtained in every community. On that fact everything depend s— eluding one of our main hopes of achieving the £1,500,000 target. “If we are to continue to dis charge our responsibilities to the men and women of the Second World War our income must be increased and the immediate target of £1,500,000 must be achieved.” That is our National Chairman’s statement. “Must” it is. So we emphasise once again the value and the responsibilities of Remembrance Week which is discussed in ful ler detail on this page. In Remembrance Week lies the possibility of raising an equal amount again to that collected by the public sale of the Poppy emblem and Poppy wreaths. As the day approaches reports show that confidence through out the world-wide organisation is increasing. May the sun shine! Poppy Day Petrol We have been assured by the Ministry of Fuel and Power that Regional Petroleum Officers will give sympathetic considera tion to applications for petrol by Poppy Day Organisers. Applications should be made by P.D.O.’s themselves, with the exception of those based on tbe Tunbridge Wells and London Petroleum Offices who should apply to Poppy Day Head- rters. orthern Ireland applications aid be made to the British ion Area Secretary, 97, •th Street, Belfast. 11 petrol demands on Poppy r Headquarters must be smpanied by Registration ’&lt;? and horsepower of cars. Remembrance Week is a mat ter which must depend for its success on the general goodwill of the local community toward the ex-Service cause. Its suc cess or failure will be, in part, a measure of the interest which exists locally in the welfare of the men and women who served in His Majesty’s Forces and who suffer in one way or another as a result of that ser vice. Remembrance Week can only be run by the community. Those already directly con cerned with the’ responsibility and administration of the Poppy Day Appeal itself—the house- to-house collection, the street sale, etc.—are so heavily com mitted that they could not be expected to organise particular money raising events at the same time. The official Poppy Day Committee or Organiser can do no more than initiate the Week by extending invitations to others to promote money raising events at the Remem brance period. It is for this reason that stress is laid on the value of “other organisations” in the “Guide to Organisers.” It is these “other organisations” who may, in fact, be expected, collectively, to create the local Remembrance Week. Who and what are these “other organisations”? Here is a list, in sections, of the types of organisations which we have in mind and most of which exist, in one form or another, in the average size town. Every local community, right down to the smallest rural district, possesses several ^of these “other organisations.” A. Industry and Trade. Chamber of Commerce. Chamber of Trade. Trade Associations. Professional Societies. Rotary Club. Inner Wheel, etc., etc. B Social Services. Women’s Voluntary Service. Women’s Institute. Mothers’ Union. Y.M.C.A. Girls’ Friendly Society. Young Farmers’ Clubs, etc., etc. C. Entertainment World. Amateur Dramatic Societies. Musical Societies. Local Cinema Clubs. Dance Clubs. Billiard Clubs. Bridge Clubs, etc., etc. D. Sports World. Football Clubs. Athletic Clubs. Motor and Cycle Clubs, etc,, etc. E. Youth Organisations. Boy Scouts. Girl Guides. Youth Auxiliary Training Services—Air Training Corps, etc. Youth Clubs, etc., etc. The list is almost endless. The types of organisations in the sections suggested here have been taken at random and every Organiser will readily be able to add his own suggestions appropriate to his local com munity. Many of these organi sations are, it can be taken for granted, sy mpathetic to the ex- NEWS VIEWS PICTURES — PLEASE It is hoped that Poppy Post No. 8, our Novem ber issue, will be devoted entirely to news and picture reports of our 1947 Poppy Day Appeal throughout the world. We rely on you, the local Poppy Day Organ iser, to send us any re ports you can, any pic tures and any general comment of interest, for consideration for Poppy Post. First we want news— second, pictures—third, views. Send all the facts about your local Appeal, public reaction to it, particular events organ ised, etc., etc. Poppy Post No. 8 will go to press as soon as possible after Poppy Day. How soon it is in your hands depends upon how quickly we receive a representative selection of news and pictures from the world-wide Poppy Day Organisa tion. Service cause and the wel^^ work of the British Legion. Every Organiser will be able to list a dozen, two dozen—or more—local organisations which have the means and facilities for promoting some social func tion to raise money for the local Appeal. There is every justi fication for inviting these organisations to take such action this year in view of the very big financial commitments of the British Legion. It is clear that each of the sections illustrated above has particular influence with specific interests and sections of the local community. For instance, the local Rotary Club, grouped in section “A,” with a membership consisting of a rep resentative of every trade and profession within the local con^^ munity, is particularly we. I placed to promote internal col lections, or social functions, within factories and large in dustrial houses locally^ The entertainment world again has its artistes, some of whom will offer to give their services free, or at a reduced fee, to a concert in aid of the local Appeal. The sports world holds out particularly interesting possi bilities now that Poppy Day is on a Saturday. At the least the local football Club Management might agree to a collection at its ground during the afternoon match. It might well do more by promoting a Saturday even- ine social event at the Club premises for the Popov Dav Committee. As for the types of event to be organised, many will suggest themselves simply from con sideration of the types of organisations mentioned here. The nature of the function is finally, of course, up to che local organisation which agrees to promote a social event. _ But some Organisers will wisn to suggest particular functions to certain organisations or people. To these events why not add the local Firework Display on November 5th. If it is already organised, is a collection for Haig’s Fund impossible? And here is an idea which came from the Geneva Branch of the Legion—a Commemoration Ball to celebrate the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Lieut. Mountbatten. The cause is appropriate and important enough.October, 1947 POPPY POST 3 TELL YOUR SELLERS . . . It is strongly recommended that Poppy Day Organisers —and sub-Organisers where districts are large —should arrange at least one “get together” of all their helpers including sellers, a fortnight or so before Poppy Day. Those who put so much work voluntarily into the Poppy Day Appeal are worthy of the appreciation which can be shown at such a meeting. The occasion should be used especially to give all helpers the essential facts regarding the purpose and function of the Appeal. Knowing these facts a seller on the street on Poppy Day is then able to give the proper answer to the enquiring layman”—a satisfactory answer can often mean a much bigger donation.

The Poppy Day collection is made mostly on private premises, at church services, and as the re sult of concerts, sporting events, garden parties, and sales of produce. Total collections raised in each of the continents overseas in 1946 were as follows:— Europe, £15,544; Asia, £36,580; Africa, £19,160; America, £20,682; Oceania, £900.

We are, in fact this year, drawing on our small capital reserves. Over £1,000,000 is being absorbed to finance the in valuable day-to-day work That is the situation. Our world-wide Poppy Day Organisation—Poppy Day Committees and Organisers and the many thousands of voluntary workers interest ed in the ex-Service cause—will, I am sure, rise to the occasion. of nearly 5,000 Legion Service Committees which are alleviating temporary needs of ex- Service people, to maintain and expand the Legion’s Convalescent Homes, its special schemes for medical treatment, its rehabilitation and resettle- ^.^nent schemes, its aid to employment, its constant and successful work to se cure pensions for war disabled men and women, and to support many other services which the Legion administers both in this country and in certain areas overseas. The Legion is spending beyond its income. Its income for benevolent and welfare work is the Poppy Day Appeal collection, and a grant from the United Services Fund which this year amounts to £100,000. From Poppy Day 1946, we may expect a final nett in come of approximately £850,000. The Legion’s welfare lia- bilitiesare increasing rapid ly. There is the possibility of a financial crisis and in creased unemployment in the near future. Inevitably ex-Service people will feel the effect. When that moment arrives, the British Legion’s power to assist the ex- Service community will be strained to the utmost. OurgreatwelfareOrgani- sation needs an annual income approaching £2,000,000. Let us give ourselves the immediate target of £1,500,000. And let us, above all else, present that target to British people Everywhere. Poppy Day is the Public's Day. Let us give British people a full opportunity. They zczV/remember practi cally—and even more gen erously—if made fully aware of the greater need which exists to-day. We of the Poppy Day Organisation, and of the Legion, have a great re sponsibility to the ex-Ser vice community. But the British public has an even greater responsibility. By telling the public the story of the Nation-wide welfare service which we have created with its money —subscribed on Poppy Day—we shall in turn con vince the man in the street of the great living memorial which he, through us, has created. Knowing that story in all its variety, Brit ish people generally will, I am convinced, give our Appeal their active support and provide us with the means to maintain and extend their own Living Memorial.2 POPPY POST POPPY POST AND REMEMBRANCER 26, ECCLESTON SQUARE, LONDON, S.W.I. Telephone: Victoria 7661 WeVe Off ! With the arrival of Septem ber the World-wide Poppy Day Organisation begins to go into action. By mid-September, those who believe in careful planning will have determined the overall shape of their local campaign, culminating itself on Poppy Day, Saturday, Novem ber 8th. From many reports already received at Headquarters, it is clear that many local Commit tees and Organisers, hayng determined their general plan, have already gone into action *‘in the field.” We are confident that the Appeal as a whole is this year off to a good flying start. Good Luck ! We wish all Organising Com mittees and Organisers every good fortune in their efforts to promote a greater and livelier public interest within the local community in the welfare of ex- Service men and women. Let us invite the public to show its sympathy and to recognise its responsibility. Give the public the facts, open the door to them, and we believe that the shortage of active help which is general throughout the country, will be satisfactorily overcome. Best wishes, in particular, to some of our Overseas Organisers who face particular difficulties. Organising Poppy Day is never a simple affair—not even in a peaceful English Village. But organising Poppy Day in a country torn by political actions, where to sell Poppies in the streets may well be dangerous, as well as difficult, is a job indeed! Special thanks are due to our stout supporters in Palestine, in particular, who on Poppy Day, 1946, triumphed in spite of everything. ORDERS, Please ! The early start already made by many Poppy Day Organisers is already reflected in the grow ing number of yellow requisition forms which have already been returned, complete, to Poppy Day Headquarters. The more the merrier! FOR YOUR INFORMATION . . . In their efforts to create strong active interest in the local Appeal, and to persuade other organisations to promote money-raising events, Poppy Day Organisers need accurate and up-to-date information regarding the Appeal, and Haig’s Fund into which all collections go. They need to know something of the origin and background of Poppy Day, the need for the Appeal to continue, and so on. We publish in this article facts which it; is believed will be found useful by many Organisers to assist them to persuade other people and other organisations to support this year’s local Appeal. This article embraces certain major policy points on which the national Appeal is based this year. The Greatest Appeal in the World. The Poppy Day Appeal. The first Poppy Day Appeal was held in 1921 and the figure raised in that year was £106,000. Public support for the Poppy Day Appeal has ever since been most generous. Dui'ing the years of the recent War the public showed their sympathy so strongly that in six years— that is from 1939 to 1945—the revenue resulting from Poppy Day almost doubled. In 1939 Poppy Day raised nearly £600,000. In 1945, six years later, the £1,000,000 was achieved, making Poppy Day far and away the biggest and most successful one day appeal in the world. The Origin of Poppy Day. The manner in which British people all over the world came to adopt the Poppy as the Emblem of Remembrance for our War dead, is a fascinating story. The development of the Poppy until the moment when it becomes our National Emblem of Remembrance for our War dead can be traced right back to a Flanders battlefield. The story begins with the poem written by Colonel McCrae, a Canadian Royal Army Medical Corps Officer, serving in France. This poem, now so well known to most British people, is the one which begins— ‘Tn Flanders’ fields the poppies blow Between the crosses, row on row” and which ends with the chal lenge— “If ye break faith with us who die We shall not sleep though poppies grow In Flanders’ fields.” That poem was written by Colonel McCrae during the second battle of Ypres in 1916, and in due course the poem was published anonymously in Journals throughout the world. In the meantime Colonel McCrae himself in May, 1918, was brought as a stretcher case to one of the big hospitals on the coast of France. He was dying; the verses were in his mind at the last, for he said to his doc tor one evening, “Tell them this, If ye break with us who die we shall not sleep.” Amongst the millions who read that poem was a certain Moina Michael, and with the mention of her name the story moves across the Atlantic to America. Miss Michael worked in New York in a Y.M.C.A. Canteen during the Great War. As a result of reading the poem she decided that for her the best and only way to persist in keep ing the faith was by the wear ing of the same poppy which had inspired Colonel McCrae to write his poem originally. To this American woman must go the credit for recognising for the first time the poppy as the flower of Remembrance. She introduced the idea to a small group of her close associates. A French lady, Madame Guerin, visiting America, met Miss Michael and heard the story of how she came to adopt the wearing of the poppy. Madame Guerin returned to France with the idea, which she first of all introduced there, to raise money to assist the French children in the devastated areas of that country. She also persuaded several French manufacturers to take an inter est in the production of the poppy commercially. Having done this, she visited England in 1921. It was at this moment that the British Legion and the Poppy met together. Madame Guerin was introduced to Officials of the Legion and her suggestion about the poppy emblem submitted to the late Field Marshal Earl Haig, and immediately approved. In the next three months, with orders for the first poppies placed with the French manufacturers, the first of our British Poppy Days was rapidly organised and became a fact for the first time on November 11th, 1921. That,, very briefly, is the origin of Poppy Day. In June, 1922, the Legion, for the first time, started making its own poppies in two rooms of a house in the Old Kent Road, London. There were five em ployees. Contrast that with the British Legion’s fine modern factory now standing on the banks of the Thames at Rich mond, Surrey, giving employ ment to over 400 badly disabled ex-Service men and making well over 40,000,000 poppies a year, as well as thousands of wreaths. From the smallest beginnings the Poppy Day Appeal has grown into an organisation of considerable extent and com plexity, giving employment to hundreds of severely disabled men and providing the financial means for assisting hundy^s of thousands on their retun. .o civilian fife after service in their country’s cause. WHAT IS POPPY DAY? Poppy Day is the public’s Day. It is the day which the British people all over the world originally adopted, at the sug gestion of Earl Haig, as the occasion on which they would remember practically the debt they owe to those who gave their fives, to those who suf fered as a result of service to their country, and to their de pendants. (Remembrance Day, with which Poppy Day is always so closely finked, is, on the other hand, the day when the public remember spiritually by observing the Two Minutes Silence and by partaking in the religious services held on that, day). 4 With money-raising becoming increasingly difficult the Poppy Day Appeal everywhere needs every support— active support —from the public. It is vitally necessary that the public should realise that “Poppy Day is the public’s day” and be given the maximum opportunity of assist ing actively in the local Poppy Day organisation as well as being encouraged to give gener ously for their Poppy. It should be the function of all Legion members to stimulate and guide public interest in ex-Service welfare, and so lead local thought in ex-Service matters, that a five public interest in Poppy Day becomes an established fact. It is to the advantage of all ex-Service people (the Legion exists to serve them all) that events should take this course. The Need for the Appeal. Is it necessary for the Poppy Day Appeal to continue? The need for the Appeal not merely continues to exist, but is to-day greater than ever. The main reasons why the need is greater to-day are:— (a) Of a total 6£ million men and women who served in H.M. Services during the 1939/45 war nearly 4£ million are already demobilised. They are, therefore, ex-Service and each one of them en titled, if in genuine need, to the welfare assistance (Continued on Page 4 Col. 4)' , POPPY POST EMPHASIS ON PUBLICITY. No. 2 WORK . . . HOMES ... • • • —For Ex-Service People On this page we continue consideration of the publicity needs of the Poppy Day Appeal. The subject was opened in a supplement to Poppy Post entitled “Emphasis on Publicity,” which was sent to overseas Organisers with the June Poppy Post, and to all home Organisers with the July Letter. That supplement contained the following paragraph amongst others: “Persuade the public that the success of Poppy Day is ITS responsibility. Tell the public the story of what is done with the monies it gives on Poppy Day. Those are ■r&gt;e two main principles upon which our publicity campaign stands this year.” Emphasis on Publicity Number I outlined, with illustrations,the methods and mediums—posters, window bills, hand bills — being supplied^this year todrive home the first principle — Poppy Day is the public’s responsibility. Now we publish details to enable Poppy Day Organisers to follow up the suggestion contained in the second sentence of the same paragraph: “Tell the public the story of what is done with the moneys it gives on Poppy Day.” Here are the facts — accurate, up-to-date, and in a form intended to give a clear picture of what the Poppy Day Appeal enables the British Legion to achieve for all ex-Service people. Here is the story, told in four sections—Work, Homes, Health, Peace—words which are understood by everybody . . . words which mean something ... which to those who are without, through no fault of their own, mean everything. HEALTH PEACE THE LIVING MEMORIAL. HOMES. TN 1921 British people raised £100,000 to start one national ^ welfare fund for all ex-Service men and women and their dependants. It was called Haig’s Fund and administered by the British Legion. Each year since, on behalf of the Nation, and sustained by the annual Appeal, the British Legion has administered a welfare organisation unparalleled in the world. Its help and advice is immediately available to all ex-Service people (including Merchant Navy), all families and dependants, all widows and children of those killed in action. To-day the Legion dispenses over £1,000,000 a year. This is how the British people have chosen to remember—by a great national Living Memorial expressed in four simple words— WORK, HOMES, HEALTH, PEACE. VORK. The Legion constantly pursues a reasonable preference in employment for ex-Service people, based on equality of oppor- unity. A Joint Committee of the Legion and the Trade Union Con gress has been set up to discuss matters of common interest iffecting ex-Service men and women. Negotiations and co-operation with the Ministry of Labour ind National Service are gaining employment for thousands of jx-Service men and women (over 16,000 in 1946 alone). In this way, too, fuller training facilities have been secured lor the demobilised. Important arrangements with Trade Associations have been included whereby ex-Service men and women are enabled to use :heir Service trade experience to enter civil occupations. ^ The Legion Business Advice Service safeguards gratuities and hard-earned savings from rash investment. Business loans are made available to those wishing to start Dn their own, and financial assistance is given for the pui chase Df necessary tools and equipment. Work for the disabled has always been a special care of the British Legion. Striving to give them a purpose in life and a living wage, the Legion has for many years advocated training and subsequent compulsory employment in industry. The Government has now accepted this principle under the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act, which, amongst other things, requires employers to take on a percentage of disabled Persons. The Legion itself is the greatest employer of disabled in the world. It runs the Poppy Factory, employing ^ Tweed Factory, a Furniture Factory, the National ^ ar rlants’ Company operating in seventy centres, and the Disabled Men's IndustS for thos! so badly crippled that they can only work at home. Housing authorities throughout the country are pressed to grant a reasonable preference for ex-Service people. House purchase loans are made available to ex-Service people. Financial assistance is given to meet rents and pay for removals. Legion Haig Homes, some 200 dwellings in various centres, provide houses and flats at special rentals for the disabled and for widows. The special housing .scheme for the part-paralysed is being extended. HEALTH. Preston Hall, Kent, Nayland Hall, Essex, and Douglas House, Bournemouth, form the largest centre in the world for the treat ment, training and employpient of tubercular ex-Service men and women. Throughout Britain are country homes where invalid and aged ex-Service men and women can live, and convalescent homes providing rest and convalescence for shorter periods. Special medical schemes for the paralysed, and for those suffering from psycho-neurosis and other diseases are being rapidly extended. Special schemes exist, too, for the medical care of wives and children. Invalid chairs, artificial limbs and warm clothing required by invalids are also provided for those in need. PEACE. The greatest need of all of those who have suffered in war is peace of mind. To give this back to ex-Service men and women by helping them through the difficult period of re-adjustment is the unswerving purpose of the British Legion. The Legion’s work for the sick and the homeless has been described above. In a much wider sphere the Legion has achieved outstanding results in its fight for pensions. The Legion is currently fighting over 100.000 cases where claims for pensions and war disability have been refused by the Ministry of Pensions. By obtaining pensions formerly refused, the British Legion has already secured to the ex-Service community the remarkable sum of £9,000,000. The Legion itself grants weekly pensions to several thousand ex-Service veterans to assist them in their old age. To the young the Legion strives to give encouragement and a purpose on their return to civilian life. Its manv educational aid schemes include residential summer courses at 18 Universities and University Colleges, drivers’ school in London, aid for candidates for ordination, and the training of sons of ex-Service men in farm work.POPPY POST oppy W reaths on Overseas War Graves North-West European Facilities The British Legion is now able to offer facilities for plac ing Poppy Wreaths on graves in certain War Cemeteries in North-West Europe. It is emphasised that this Wreath-laying Service is at pre sent limited and applies to North - West European War Cemeteries only. It covers all British War Graves in the 1914- 1918 Cemeteries in France, Belgium and Holland, and 1939- 1945 War Graves in the follow ing Cemeteries only: France Brouay Douvres (La Delivrande) Hermanville Beach Jerusalem (Juaye Mondaye) Ranville (6 Airborne Div. Extn.) St. Manvieu Tilly-sur-Seulles Cambes Fontenay-le-Pesnel Hottot-les-Bagues Ranville Ryes Secqueville en Bessin Belgium Bruyelle Cheel Paqfprlee Special arrangements exist regarding British Graves in Holland. Through the Nether lands War Graves Committee, every British Grave in Holland has now been “adopted” by a Dutch family. This does not, of course, take the place of the maintenance of the Graves and Cemeteries which is, initially, the duty of the Army and later that of the Imperial War Graves Commission. Further, these Dutch families are willing to place Wreaths and cut flowers on the Graves, and also to supply a description of any Grave, if requested to do so by the relative concerned. Relatives wishing to have a Poppy Wreath laid on a Grave in any of the 1914-1918 Ceme teries in France or Belgium, on a 1939-1945 Grave in any one of the Cemeteries listed above, or on any War Grave in Hol land, can obtain an Order Form, either from the local Legion Branch, or by writing 'direct to the British Legion Appeal (Haig’s Fund), 2(5, Eccleston Square, London, S.W.l. ^ It is hoped to offer similar Wreath-laying Services, cover ing 1939 - 1945 British War Graves, in other Cemeteries in France, Belgium and Germany in due course. No immediate prospect of the opening of Wreath-laying Services in other theatres of War is visualised. In making this Service avail able, the British Legion has, under considerable difficulties, begun to rebuild its pre-war Wreath-laying organisation. In addition, and as soon as practic able, facilities will be available whereby relatives can also obtain photographs of the Grave showing the Poppy Wreath placed on the Head-Cross. Poppy Cross Ashes at Arnhem Airborne Pilgrimage ~ The ashes of Poppy Crosses, placed last year at the Empire Field of Remembrance, at We: minster Abbey, and 'ht other Fields of Remembrance, will be scattered at Oosterbeek Ceme tery, Holland, on September 15th, by an Airborne pilgrimage. The visit is being organised by the Airborne Security Fund on the third anniversary of the Battle of Arnhem. Oosterbeek, a village lying just outside Arnhem, and a place at which many Airborne Troops dropped during the fight, is the location of one of the biggest Airborne cemeteries. The Empire Field of Remem brance, at Westminster, is always organised by the Staff of the Poppy Factory at Rich mond, Surrey. On closing the Field, the thousands of Crosses placed by Associations and individuals, are taken back to the Factory and then burnt. The scattering of the ashes at some appropriate spot was customary pre-war. China Helps Haig’s Fund The sum of £252, which it seemed likely was lost, has re cently come into Haig’s Fund, as a result of the sympathetic consideration of the Financial Authorities in the Chinese Government. The £252 was part of the total raised in Tientsin on Poppy Day 1946. Owing to the severe fluctuations in the Chinese Ex change at • the time, this sum was temporarily lost on transfer of the total Tientsin collection to this country. When this was discovered representations were made to the Chinese Authorities. The result was— agreement to make good this loss in exchange. Many Overseas Poppy Day Organisers suffer similar losses from their total collection as the result of the Foreign Exchange situation. It can be particularly disappointing to those who work so hard to raise money for Haig’s Fund, and the under standing shown by the Chinese Authorities has been much appreciated. Guide to Organiser New Booklet issued A new Poppy Day Guide is being issued to all official Organisers early in September. The purpose of this new Guide to Organisers is to give general guidance, to inform local Organisers of National Poppy Day Headquarters’ policy and how it might be implemented locally by particular money- raising schemes, and to give up- to-date and full information re garding the purpose of the Poppy Day Appeal and the need for it to continue^ Lord Cromwell, in an open ing message, lays stress on the extent of the welfare needs of the ex-Service community to day. It is pointed out that this Guide is issued to all who have already confirmed that they are organising the 1947 Poppy Day in their locality. It is not being issued other than to the official Organisers on the lists held at Poppy Day Headquarters. £975,000 1946 Result The National Account for the 1946 Poppy Day Appeal will close at approximately £975,000, a decrease of around £33,000 on the record 1945 collection when the £1,000,000 mark was reached for the first time. The National Poppy Day Account does not close officially until September 30th, the end of the financial year. At the time of going to press the comparative figures up to the 20th August for 1946 and 1945 are: 1946—£973,356; 1945— £1,007,684. B.B.C. Remembrance Day Appeal The British Legion Appeal has been allotted the Week’s Good Cause five-minute broadcast at 8.25 p.m., Sunday, November 9th. Sunday, November 9th, is Remembrance Day. A broad cast Appeal on that^vening will undoubtedly find listeners as a whole in a receptive frame of mind. The majority will have attended a Remembrance Ser vice or Ceremony of one form or another during the day, and the Appeal to send donations to Haig’s Fund is certain to receive more sympathetic attention than a broadcast made on the previous Sunday. Since the British region Ap peal will not be made until the evening of Remembrance Day, the broadcast cannot usefully include an Appeal for assistance to sell poppies and to help in the local Appeal Organisation. It is pointed out that the Week’s Good Cause broadcasts are rigidly controlled by the B.B.C. Appeals Advisory Com mittee which allots all such periods available throughout the year. However desirable as a means of gaining additional helpers, it is impossible to se cure the Week’s Good Cause on the previous Sunday as these periods on the first Sunday in the month are m variably allotted to B.B.C. Regional sta tions for Appeals for charitable causes in their own areas. It is not possible to achieve separate Regional Appeals for a National cause such as the British Legion Appeal. It is hoped that the B.B C. may agree to include appeals for helpers for Poppy Day in Announcement periods several weeks before Poppy Dav. Information regarding the Speaker making the British Legion Appeal on Remembrance Day evening will be given later. (Continued from Page 2 Col. 4) which the Poppy Day Appeal alone enables the British Legion to ad minister. In due course all 6'&gt; million will be added to the great family of ex-Service people whom the Legion strives to serve. (b) Many men of the 1914-18 war, in addition to the veterans of earlier cam paigns, are now at an age where they can no longer be expected to fend successfully for themselves. As a result they are becoming a more—and increasingly— expensive liability on t|^&gt; Legion’s welfare aiV_ benevolent services. This further liability in par ticular the Legion must never fail to meet. (c) Whilst the Legion’s finan cial responsibilities are rapidly increasing, the £1,000,000 raised by Poppy Day, 1945, for in stance, will not buy in terms of benevolent and welfare services as much as the £500,000 raised in 1938. The Poppy Day Appeal is Not a Charity. The Legion Appeal (Haig’s Fund), to which all Poppy Day monies are credited, is a Wel fare Fund in the best sense of the term. It is a Welfare Fund created by the British people/ - ^ themselves as a tribute, and a practical memorial, to those who served their country faith fully in war. The Legion Poppy Day Appeal is no more a “charity” than the welfare fund set up by a firm for its workers This principle is very import ant. It provides the true answer to those who are to-day saying that ex-Service people in need should not have to rely on a “charity” such as the Poppy Day Appeal, and that such an appeal as Poppy Day is no longer necessary in view of the Government’s social service schemes. Poppy Day is World Wide. To Gibraltar, Malta (George Cross Island), Egypt, Persia, Abyssinia, Portuguese East Africa, Fiji, Ascension Island, St. Helena, China to South America, and to a large num ber of far away places — wherever there is a British Community, poppies are sent every year, also to British Troops in every Overseas Com mand by Sea and Air. In the last 4 to 5 months before Poppy Day, Headquarters despatches in the region of 45,000,000 Poppies and 55,000 Poppy Wreaths to Poppy Day Organisers and Committees all over the world. The Poppy is seen in the streets of over 50 countries every November. Passengers on ocean-going liners will also be “button-holed” on board ship. Issued by the BRITISH LEGION APPEAL (HAIG’S FUND), 26, Eccleston Square, London, S.IF.l.GENERAL INCREASE IN POPPY DAY COLLECTIONS ‘Touch and Go’ to the £1,000,000 Poppy Day Collections for 1947, both at home and overseas, show a marked general increase over the previous years collections. On March 30th last, the National Poppy Day Account for 1947 stood at £935,066 as compared with £919,967 up to the same period in 1946. With the big majority of Poppy Day Accounts at home and overseas now received into the National Account, there is every likelihood of the present lead of £15,099 being maintained up to the final closing of the Account at the end of September. If this forecast proves correct the 1947 Poppy Day Appeal Account will close at approximately £995,000 and therefore only £5,000 short of the £1,000,000 itself. greatest credit goes to Poppy Day Committees and Organisers throughout the country and overseas for attain ing this general increase at a time when conditions were un doubtedly more, and not less, difficult than in the preceding years. In the main the increased collections can only be due firstly to improved organisa tion of local Appeal machinery. The results would also seem to indicate that, after two years, the British public generally have accepted the new arrange ment by which the Sunday prior to November 11th is the national Remembrance Day and the day • immediately preceding it, Sat urday, the annual Poppy Day. Published above is a break down of the National Account showing figures for 1947 and 1946 up to the end of February. This analysis gives clear indica tions as to the general trend of events. It indicates increased Poppy Day collections in all areas except Northern and Southern Ireland.

The ex-Service man with other than wartime service is helped from funds other than those raised on Poppy Day—the sources of income for this purpose are legacies, donations and the like. very unsettled conditions, are the overseas results which at the end of February were almost £6,000 ahead of the previous year. The considerable drop in revenue from donations both in the Metropolitan and Provincial Areas is perhaps a sign of the times. Donations received as a result of the B.B.C. Week’s Good Cause Appeal are credited to Provincial and Metropolitan areas and are consequently included in the Donations total quoted alongside. Proceeds of all local sales of Poppy wreaths are credited to local Poppy Day Appeals and the increase in sales, to date of over £2,500 is satisfactory. It is hoped in the future that these figures may be still fur ther swollen by the demand for the Legion’s new Overseas Wreath Laying Service. Proceeds from sales of wreaths to pur chasers requiring overseas lay ing will in the same way be credited to the local Poppy Day Appeal totals.2 POPPY POST POPPY POST AND REMEMBRANCER BACKGROUND TO HAIG’S FUND The Legion’s Welfare System For over 20 years Haig’s Fund has ranked as the leading ex-Service Welfare Fund in this country, financed in the main by the Poppy Day Appeal. This article outlines the general background history leading to the establishment of Haig’s Fund and the administrative machinery through which the Fund is dispensed daily up and down the country in meeting temporary and other needs amongst the ex-Service community. 26, EGGLESTON SQUARE, LONDON, S.W.I. Telephone: Victoria 7661 HAIG’S FUND. Haig’s Fund, administered by the British Legion, still ranks as the only national fund for all ex-Service people and their dependants. Haig’s Fund holds a position of high importance in the social services of this country. The Poppy Day Appeal still provides the main, and almost the whole, income to Haig’s Fund. The other sources of income derive from legacies and individual gifts received at other times of the year than the Remembrance period. WHO IS HELPED? It is important that the public at large should realise that the Poppy Day Appeal is still made in the name of the war-time Service man and woman and his or her dependants. All other categories of ex-Service people, those who serve in peace-time, those serving short time con scription periods, are helped from the funds raised at other times of the year than Poppy Day. It is extraordinary how much misunderstanding still exists regarding the extent and variety of help which the British Legion administers with the revenue accruing to Haig’s Fund. There are still some who believe that the main purpose of the Poppy Day Appeal, for instance, is merely to give em ployment to seriously disabled men by the making of poppies! Whilst important, this function is but a very small part of the whole. There are others who believe that the Fund provides for disabled ex-Service men only, and others again who think that the help given is limited to ex-Service people of 1914-18. These misunderstandings should not be allowed to con tinue. It is of the utmost importance to Haig’s Fund and future Poppy Day Appeals that the public should be made fully aware of the extent and variety of the welfare and benevolent Continued on page 3, column 4 Unity Relief Fund Prior to the inception of the British Legion and the creation of Haig’s Fund in 1921, the four main ex-Service organisations in Great Britain administered a fund known as the Unity Re lief Fund through a Central Committee, Unity Relief was one of the main welfare funds in the country and was insti tuted in 1920 with a grant of £150,000. This sum was pro vided from the residue of an Appeal made by the then Prince of Wales, Following on this Field-Marshal Earl Haig made his Appeal to Sportsmen which raised £22,000, and in March, 1921, Captain W. G. Willco'x organised the War riors’ Day Appeal which re sulted in a further £70,000 be ing allotted to the Unity Re lief Fund and a sum of £30,000 to the Officers’ Association. The four ex-Service associa tions who together controlled the Unity Relief Fund were the National Federation of Dis- charged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers, the National Association of Dis charged Sailors and Soldiers, the Comrades of the Great War, and the Officers’ Association. At this time great efforts were being made by leaders in the ex-Service world to bring the existing separate organisations together and to amalgamate in to one national body. At the same time progress was being made towards the amalgama tion of existing ex-Service wel fare Funds and with the for mation of the British Legion the Unity Relief Fund became the Benevolent Department of the British Legion, the Legion be ing automatically responsible for its administration in the interests of all ex-Service people. Unity Relief already had some hundreds of local Com mittees operating up and down the country, and within a short period the Legion itself had, on this basis, established nearly 2,000 benevolent Committees for the relief of distress brought about by the 1914-18 war. The Warriors’ Day appeal, which did so much to strengthen the Unity Relief Fund, was fol lowed in the same year by the first of our Poppy Day Appeals. This was the Appeal on Novem ber 11th, 1921, which raised £106,000 and which, over the intervening years, has now brought in over £14,000,000 to Haig’s Fund—the fund which now holds an assured position as the one national fund for all ex-Service people. United Services Fund Whilst the Unity Relief Fund stood, in 1929, as one of the more important sources of re lief to ex-Service people, there also existed, though under separate control, an even big ger Fund. This was the United Services Fund into which passed in 1919 the profits made by Service Canteens during the 1914-18 war. Remember! HAIG’S FUND is still to-day the only national Fund for all ex-Service people and their depen dents. As such, it is most worthy of active public support at all times. In 1927, after considerable discussion, the co-ordination of the thousands of Legion Benevo lent Committees and the Area and local representatives of the United Services Fund was achieved with a consequent overall improvement in the efficiency and administration of ex-Service welfare machin ery throughout the country. In 1934, as a result of further pro gress, the British Legion be came responsible for part of the United Services Fund’s ad ministrative responsibilit i e s. The thirteen Area staffs of the United Services Fund were con centrated into five Relion.^^^a- der the administrative control of the Legidn Benevolent De partment in London. As a re sult of this amalgamation the Benevolent Department became known by title as the British Legion and United Services Fund Benevolent Department. The Service Committee In 1947 there were no less than 4,323 local Service Com mittees administering to the needs of ex-Service people all over this country, and 35 Com mittees in overseas areas. It is particularly interesting to note that a Service Committee in the Channel Islands continued its work throughout the German occupation during the rece^fc war! More than 50,000 volun tary workers make up the great band who are working daily as members of these Service Com mittees. The Service Committee is the equivalent of the former Benevolent Committee. Whilst it is impossible to indicate ac curately the full variety of wel fare cases handled by a local Service Committee it may be said generally that there is no type of need which does not come under the guidance of such a Committee. The Com mittees normally work inde pendently though they fre quently consult with Regional or Area offices of the Legion. Membership of a Service Com mittee is made up of represen tatives of other ex-Service organisations as well as the Legion, and many other public spirited people who have a par ticular interest in the ex-Ser- vice community are also mem bers. It was through these 4,000 Service Committees that no less than £800,000 was dis pensed in meeting temporary and other needs amongst the ex-Service community in the 12 months ending September 30th, 1947. The fund available to them derives in the main from the Ponpy Day Appeal, though part of the income comes from donations, legacies, investments, and also from contributions from the United Services Fund and other organisations.POPPY POST 3 NAYLAND SERVES THE EX-SERVICE WOMEN The Model Sanatorium In the valley of the River Stour, amidst the peaceful Constable country of Suffolk, lies Nayland—the only sanatorium ever to be designed solely for the care of Tubercular ex- Service women. /- interesting one. The story of its inception is an 1 )R. JANE WALKER, M.D., who had taken her degree in Vienna—because, in her day, it was impossible for women to do so in England—practised in Hanley Street; but so deep was h^Bdove of Suffolk and its people that, in 1901, she opened Nayland as a pioneer—if not THE pioneer—of open - air treatment in cases of T.B. It was originally intended en tirely for children, but with the coming of the 1914-18 war many sick and weary soldiers found sanctuary and rest within its tranquil borders. In the early part of the cen tury the path of occupational therapy was still unexplored, but “Dr. Jane” was advanced in her ideas, and the way in which she encouraged her patients to take up market gar dening, and create minor in dustries such as the making of imitation jewellery, indicates her appreciation of the value of this form of curative treat- ^aent. ^Pln 1938 “Dr. Jane” died, at the age of 79, absorbed in her work till the last, and it looked as though the good work of Nayland was in danger of dying with her. It was then that the British Legion acted. Such was the success of the Village Settlement at Preston Hall, in Kent, that they decided to establish a sister sanatorium at Nayland, for the benefit of Tubercular ex-Service women. By May 1st, 1943, Nayland had come to life again, under the same management as Pres ton Hall, and on the 21st March. 1945, was officially opened by H.M. the Queen. Many a Service girl of the recent war has come to the Sanatorium sick and de pressed, and afraid to look into the future, lest sh e may see only an existence of eternal self- care and grey monotony. But in the happy peaceful atmosphere of Nayland, she soon discovers a warmth that eases her numb despair, and a bright ray of hope that dispels the dark shadows of her mind. Her brain becomes a clearing house for values, as proportion replaces distortion. All around her are cheerful, contented girls — some not fully active yet in body, but all busy with their minds and their hands. A number are making poppies for the com ing Poppy Day Appeal, a form of occupational therapy for which they are paid; others have progressed to such em ployment as handvyork, tele phone duty, domestic orderly, social services, and work in the office, the garden, and the library. Several have ad vanced even further and, via the occupation of nursing orderly, have taken examina tions in nursing, and stayed on the staff. Caught up by this spirit of cheerful activity, the newcomer is soon willing to face the future, which now holds re newed hope and clear design. Gone is the fear and uncer tainty; her will to recover is strengthened, for each goal achieved brings a fuller life. The sanatorium has its own Social Club and library, and a British Legion Branch, com plete with Women’s Section. As part of a scheme of diver- sional therapy, the girls run their own fetes, films and con cert parties, for the benefit of their fellow-patients. But life is not all play, and education is provided by means of lec tures on almost any subject re quested. In the past, art, lan guages, current affairs and even astronomy have been cov ered. A relay system makes it possible for all bed-patients to listen to entertainments, edu cational and medical talks, and religious services from the beautiful and serene un denominational chapel. Nor has the feminine touch been overlooked. Each section of the sanatorium has a “beauty parlour,” where patients can attend to their make-up, and dress each other’s hair; for what woman does not know the tonic effect of a touch of rouge, or a new “hair-do”? The sanatorium is divided into three blocks, with light and airy bedrooms, whose large windows so easily catch the sun. Some of the rooms have verandahs overlooking flower gardens, pine trees, well-kept lawns and magnificent wooded countryside. In the grounds are a number of chalets, where patients in the later stages of rehabilita tion can live a practically nor mal life, entirely surrounded once more by their own be longings. Here, in peace, they can take stock of themselves, and plan a suitable future. Financial difficulties do not arise, for Nayland is respon sible for seeing that there is no hindrance to complete rehabili tation. Thirty-two per cent, of all the patients treated—and they number well over a thousand —have now returned to a full, normal life, and many others to light household duties—an achievement which “Dr. Jane” would surely have been proud to have connected with her be loved Nayland. OVERSEAS WREATH LAYING Photo Service Opens The British Legion’s Overseas Wreath Laying Service in North West Europe comes into full operation as from April 1st, from which date the Graves Photographic Service becomes effective. From the beginning of the month any member of the British public will be able to purchase a special Overseas Poppy wreath, have it reverently laid on their behalf on any Service grave in North West Europe, receive photographs of the grave and cemetery at reasonable charges, and be the recipient of a report on the condition of the grave and the cemetery, which is sent direct from the Brussels Office of the British Legion. It is believed that the British public will recognise this Over seas Wreath Laying Service as of real value and will welcome it generally. The facilities offered cannot be obtained through any other source and the British Legion is therefore anxious that the public generally should be made aware of the existence of the Service. All readers are invited to spread the information by all appro priate means in their own localities. One of the many ways of bringing the Overseas Wreath Laying Service to the notice of the public is shop window display. On this page is an illustration of such a window display which was used by the Minehead (Som.) Poppy Day Organiser as part of the general publicity scheme for the 1947 Poppy Day Appeal. Any person or Organiser requiring full details is invited to write for the Overseas Wreath Laying Service leaflet to the Organising Secretary, British Legion, Haig’s Fund, 26, Eccles- ton Square, London, S.W.l. Any number of copies will be sent free on request. Continued from page 2, column 1 services administered by the British Legion. Indeed the public is entitled to know the facts for it is public money which is being used. Haig’s Fund is being dis pensed daily throughout the year. Surely we are entitled, therefore, to “talk” Haig’s Fund on every day of the year! Let us promote the Fund locally and nationally at every oppor tunity in the interests of the ex-Service community itself. Need we seek any further justification for doing so than the fact that expenditure is outstripping income? Is it likely that the near future will show any tendency toward a decrease in expenditure?4 POPPY POST OVERSEAS POPPY DAYS FORGE AHEAD Over 10% Increase In spite of increasing currency restrictions and foreign exchange rates, the total of over seas Poppy Day collections received into the National Account up to the end of February showed an increase of over 10% as against the previous year. This is a remarkable tribute to the manner in which British communities and their friends amongst the local population responded to the 1947 Appeal. The desire amongst British communities overseas to recognise their responsibilities to British ex-Service people who suffer as a result of wartime service is outstanding. CEVERAL new place names ° appeared on the lists of the localities organising 1947 Poppy Days overseas and there were other names which made a most welcome reappearance for the first time since the war years. Travellers between countries, passengers on board British liners at Remembrance Tide, also gave good support to Poppy Day, 1947, and the col lections taken by the captains of British liners total £1,758 to date, an increase of over £120. Let us take a trip eastwards and look in at the many and varied places where a Poppy Day Appeal is organised. The first of the overseas Poppy Day organisations we should meet would be the Channel Islands, where our Appeal has gone on full swing since liberation, and collections have leapt up amazingly. Even through the war years the local Benevolent Committee c o n- tinued to function during the German occupation! The west coast of France, the northern resorts of Spain, the many ports of Portugal, all have their local Poppy Day organisers, so that the British community may join at Re membrance Tide in wearing the Poppy emblem. Gibraltar beat its total of £630 in 1946 by over £1,000. Street collections alone raised £663 in 1947, donations £334, and the balance of £677 came from various functions. A Garden of Remembrance £46, a performance at the Theatre Royal by the Agrupa- cion Artistica Calpense £75, a Bridge Drive at the Garrison Library £30, a Naval raffle £71, an and Army ball £155. The Royal Navy raised an addi tional £58 by a Naval Trust Cinema Gala and a Naval Tom bola. Remembrance Day in Gibraltar was a lovely summer day. and the Mile of Pennies at the Exchange was well sup ported. When we remember how the number of troops in Gibraltar has been reduced, much of the credit must go to the civilian population. Opposite, on the North African coast, Tangier, Casa blanca, Tetuan, and districts, and Tunis had their poppies too. Malta raised £3,500 — the street collection raised £1,200, a motor car raffle £711, a grand ball £579, and other dances an additional £151. Contribu tions from churches and schools, including individual donations, raised over £440, His Excel lency the Governor of Malta extended his patronage to the Poppy Day Appeal and the Chairman of the 1947 Appeal was His Honour Mr. Justice Harding. Egypt at Remembrance time was in the grip of the cholera epidemic. The Appeal went on mainly by letter. In Port Said, Suez, Cairo, Alexandria, and throughout the Egyptian state poppies were available for the British community. Travelling down the Red Sea, Jibuti raised the sum of £216 16s. Id. from a population of nine Europeans and about 250 Arabs and Indians. There you can see the generosity of the individual response. British firms contributed largely to the Appeal as did the State Bank of Ethiopia, and many French subjects subscribed. Further down the coast at Beira in Portuguese East Africa £165 was raised. The local Governor permitted a street collection to take place, and this was made by a number of English women. A little diffi culty with the Portuguese Cus toms was overcome with the help of the British Consulate. In Beira, posters and printed matter must not be exhibited in the streets unless first trans lated into Portuguese, so the local Organiser was unable to use our posters. When the boxes were opened there was a wonderful assortment of cur rencies—paper and coins. Es cudos, the local currency; Eng lish notes and coins; Rhodesian; South African; dollars; notes and francs; East African; rupees and some Australian coinage. Our Beira Organiser tells us that it was warm enough as to be almost unbearable, and that in view of the heat the sellers’ efforts were worthy of the greatest congratulations.

At Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, the Appeal was well sup ported, especially on the social side. Poppy Day darts at the Alwiyah Club, a racing run, champagne bar, and side-shows. Miss Jean Kingston, Matron of the Royal Hospital, on going out to collect, refused a collect ing box but took a basket as being more suitable to her col lecting abilities. She just^kd her claim by bringing in’- Je record collection! And that’s the spirit which runs through our overseas Poppy Day organisation!! ROUND CORNERS! This year, despite the shortage of everything, our helpers who collect in the streets and from House to House will have to wear TWO BADGES and carry a Certificate with them. This is not our idea. For some time now we have been allowed, as an economy, to issue sellers with a certificate and a com bined House to House and Street Collection Badge. This Badge had square corners. Item No. 1. Now by a Home Office ruling against which we have protested unsuccessfully, the House to House Collector’s Badge has to have rounded corners! Item No. 2. The Home Office is concerned with the control of House to House collections only. Street Sellers of Emblems are the concern of the Police. The Home Office insists that their House to House Collector’s Badge does not carry Street Selling authority as well. Hence the need for two Badges to be worn. We protested against this new emphasis on the letter of the law. The protest was turned down by a letter which included the delightful comment:— “I am to add that it is open to you to apply to H.M. Stationery Office for a supply of House to House Collector’s Badges sufficient to enable you to bring your existing stock up to the quantity needed to cover vour requirements. The number of additional badges thus required should be notified to this Department in order that a certificate authorising the purchase of such badges may be issued.” If we can’t get enough mill- board from anywhere else we shall have to accept this generous offer.

We would ask Organisers for their comments as to the suitability of the poppies, posters and pamphlets lor their local needs. When anything special has to be printed, it is usually quicker and cheaper to have it done locally, though Headquarters is always ready to assist any special effort that is contemplated. The need of the Fund is as great as ever, and in spite of the magni ficent response from Overseas collections last year, the National figure will fall at least £50,000 below the sum of £993,631 raised in 1947. and far short of the present annual demand on the resources of the fund.

Persian Gulf. 28th March,1949. Dear Sir, As many of you may know already, Captain B. H. R. Cullin —resigned his position in July last as Organising Secretary of the British Legion Haig's Fund and, succeeding him as Director of Appeals, I take this opportunity of introducing myself to you and of expressing my hope that you will extend to me the same splendid help which you gave in the days of the first Organising Secretary, Captain W. G- Willcox, and to Captain Cullin during his period of office. I would particularly like you to know that I am not a new comer to the British Legion - my years of service (20) having heen devoted to the administration of the British Legion's welfare, Benevolent and rehabilitation schemes for the ex-Service community, which the annual Poppy Day Appeal, in the main, makes possible, and with my practical knowledge in this direction you will, I am ^Nure, more readily appreciate the keenness with which I take up my nev; post. May I first of all express the gratitude not only of Haig’s Fund, but of myself, for the generous support received from you and all our other good friends in your particular part of the World to the 1948 Poppy Day Appeal. We appreciate and are greatly encouraged, not only by the great number of enthusiastic and whole-hearted voluntary Organisers, Committees, Poppy Sellers and generous subscribers we have overseas, but by your awareness of the great debt we all owe to our Fighting Forces; by your great love of the mother country, and your very real desire to assist those ex-Service men and women with their dependants, who, as a result of their war services now find themselves in distress and difficulty. I regret having to report that last year’s Appeal will un doubtedly shew a deficit of some £50,000 on that of 1947. It is, I am convinced, a sign of the times and is the result of heavy taxation and the high cost of living which we in England, and you also overseas, suffer from acutely at the present time. I e.m, however, the more appreciative of, and happy to be able to tell you, that collections from Overseas have, to date, reached the magnificent figure of £59,887. 3. 11. which shews an increase of £3,589. 2. 3. Thank you all most sincerely. I would now turn to the coming Appeal to be held, in this country, on Saturday, 5th November next, and would express the j hope that you will again undertake its organisation and receive the renewed support of all former helpers - with many new recruits -&gt; - 2 - together with the renewed generosity of all our British friends as well as that of our many friends of other nationalities, whose sympathy and generous practical support has been of such help and so very welcome in the past. I need not tell you how imperative it is, if the British Legion is to carry on its very essential work, that we make up the 194S deficit of £50,000 as, despite the new National schemes, there is still so very much that only a voluntary organisation such as ours can do. I should like to be permitted to stress again consideration of additional special events during Remembrance Week or at a more ff convenient time during the year, as a means to this end. We appreciate to the full what a large part such additional events already play in many of our overseas organisations, but there are still many Districts who could, I feel sure, sympathetically arrange something on these lines, as our organisations over here are doing in ever increasing numbers. I enclose a new order form for supplies which I would ask you to complete and return to me at your earliest convenience, thus enabling us to pack and despatch with ample time in hand for the unavoidable delays which still so oftea occur. Also enclosed is a new pamphlet displaying the types of Poppies and advertising material we can provide. We trust you will find it informative and of assistance. The new leaflet and some of the advertising material has been somewhat altered in the hope that it will better fit overseas organisations which differ rather from our own at home. In conclusion may I say I shall always welcome news of your problems, your needs and the smallest derail of your organisation, as it will enable me to get a clearer picture of all you accomplish our behalf. 1 shall also be only too pleased to give you any information you may wish to have on the work of the British Legion which in such great measure, I repeat, your generous gifts make May I further ask the renewed help of yourself and all other friends in the collection, for our benefit, of your local and other used stamps - anything above the equivalent of 3d. is worth while - and will you leave them affixed to the envelope as this may bear an interesting postmark ologrn- which may make it more attractive to buyers. If you could ■ centralise any such collection and send in one parcel, rom I time to time, addressed to me personally, at the above address, we shall be most gratelul. Our collection Ox foreign stamps sold during the past two years has benefitted the Fund to the extent of some £35. possible.

Emergency help in unemployment, in sickness and chronic ill ness (providing those additional comforts and necessities so essential) is costing us many thousands per annum in spite of the National Health scheme. There is the upkeep of our four Convalescent Homes which take in not only individual ex- Service men and women, but in some cases their families as well, and our four permanent Homes for the aged and in capacitated. Several thousands have been spent on structu ral alterations to homes of paralysed men. The rehabilitation of those suffering from psycho-neurosis is another of our undertakings. Also, to quote but a few, there are our schemes for house purchase, small business loans, removal grants, etc. Homeless men have been provided with board and lodging, tools and travel vouchers in conjunction with the L.C.C. Welfare Office. There is our Poppy Factory, our Disabled Men’s Industries, Cambrian Factory (making cloth) Chair Factory and The Prince of Wales Pension Fund. We give advice end assis tance in obtaining pensions (with representation at Pension Appeal Tribunals) employment and housing (liaison with Labour Exchanges, the Appointments Board, Trade Councils and Traders Associations). Many thousands are expended on distress Overseas. We also support, as you will know, St. Dunstan’s for the Blind and many other allied and kindred ex-Service Welfare Associations including those for the deaf. heard by now has actually made little difference to the work to which the British Legion set its hand in 1921. It has, however, taken over the hospital side of our Tubercular Sanatoria - Preston Hall for men and Nayland Hall for women, but we continue the rehabilitation side after the disease has been arrested - many of the men being employed in our various industries at the British Legion Village near Maidstone, Kent. Our Rheumatology Unit set up some 18 months ago has also been taken over and as a result of its success the Government intend, I believe, to set up clinics in most industrial Centres. We deeply appreciate this very real generosity and in The new National Health Scheme of which you will all have- 2 - (g) jf You will appreciate ‘from these few examples the need of the British Legion continues as great as ever and I would therefore turn to the forthcoming Poppy Day Appeal which will this year fall on Saturday, November 11th. and would ask for the renewed most valued and enthusiastic co-operation of yourself, your Committee, helpers and collectors, in its organization, and for the renewed generosity of all our friends in your part of the World.

May I bring to your notice that our stocks of Sprays, motor-car and cycle Mascots (items 4, 5 &amp; 6 .) are again in short supply and request that your demands for these bo limited to your- essential needs. increase in the organization of additional special events, held during Remembrance Week or at some more convenient time during the year, to which I referred in my first letter last year, and I should like to ask for yet further consideration to be given to this possibility. In my anxiety to bring to your knowledge our work and need I fear this letter has become more lengthy than intended, but I do trust it will have proved informative and of interest and that we may again receive your ready sympathy and energies in the organization of the Appeal on November 11th next and that I may hear from you and receive your order for Poppies etc., at your very earliest convenience.

The factual poster is repeated with a changed message from the National Treasurer of the Legion. The Overseas Leaflet is similar in layout to that produced last year, though the inside contains far more factual information about the work that Poppy Day enables the British Legion to carry out. May we again stress that any special printing is best done locally as it is quicker and cheaper. We are of course always ready to provide such further factual information as may be required. Poppy Day 1941) in Great Britain was the wettest on record, and the valuable support that the Appeal receives from British Residents and their friends abroad was even more vital in keeping the work going. Order Forms, and a Return, similar to that in use in England are also enclosed. It is hoped that the compact nature of this pamphlet will assist many busy Honorary Organisers.
