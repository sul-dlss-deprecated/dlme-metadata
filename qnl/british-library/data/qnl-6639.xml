The despatches from the Secretary of State which the Government of India have now to answer are noted in the margin.* The question which they raise is that of the Turkish jurisdiction in the islands and waters of the Persian Gulf and on the Arab littoral. In its full territorial extent this question embraces the entire southern coast of the Persian and Oman Gulfs, from Koweit to Kas-el-Had, the eastern extremity of the dominions of the Sultan of Muscat; but the present note will deal, in the main, only with the Arab coast and islands between Has Tanorah and Has Mussendom, and will thus include the Turkish ports of El-Bidaa, the islands of Bahrein, Zoba- ra, El-Katr, and the territories of the Arab Trucial Chiefs. 2. The earliest of the despatches cited in the foregoing para, calls for a report from the Government of India in regard to the proceedings of the Re sident at Bushire, Captain Wodehouse of the Teazer, and Zaid-bin-Khalifa, Chief of Abuthabi towards Odeid, a village on the El-Katr coast. Sir A. Layard, writ ing on the 28th May, reported that Sadyk Pasha, the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs, had read to him a tele gram from the Wali of Busreh, com plaining that Zaid-bin-Khalifa, with 70 boats and accompanied by an Eng lish war steamer and the British Consul at Bushire, had attacked Odeid, which he described as a dependency of the Tur kish district of Castar (El-Katr). The inhabitants having fled, the village was pillaged and destroyed, and all the boats carried off. The Porte hoped that some explanation would be afforded of this descent upon Turkish territory. Lord Cranbrook, to whom the papers were referred, declined to give any detailed expression of opinion until he had consulted the Government of India; but in the meantime he drew the attention of the Foreign Office to the corres pondence of 1877, in which the India Office recommended that a dis cussion with the Porte iu regard to( 2 ) the status of Odeid should, if possible, be avoided. The reason why the Gov ernment of India have been as yet un able to inform the Secretary of State of their views on this mitter, is that Colonel Uoss’s original report of the proceedings at Odeid miscarried, and by the time a duplicate had been obtained, the other despatches from the Secretary of State, cited in paragraph 1, were received. These raised the larger question of Turkish j urisdiction over the entire Arab littoral, and necessitated further inquir ies from the local officers. 3. The history of the connection of the British Government wich Odeid is as follows. The Chief of Abuthabi of the tribe of Beni-Yas is one of the maritime Arab Chiefs on the shore of the Persian Gulf with whom the British Govern ment have relations. In 1836, the Ei- Kabizat (or Gubeysat), a section of the Beni-Yas, under Sheik Khadim-bin- Nahman, being desirous of avoiding the consequences of certain recent pira cies, seceded from Abuthabi and estab lished themselves at Odeid. In May 1837, the Chief of Abuthabi, Sheikh Khalifa, attacked the seceders, killed fifty and destroyed the settlement. But the leniency and moderation with which he used his victory induced the sece ders to return to Abuthabi. In 1849, there was a fresh secession, followed by a second compulsory return; at length, in 1869, a party under Sheikh Buttye-bin-Khadim again settled at Odeid, and repudiated their allegiance to the parent State. -n n’ S* 1 ^ ■^■ arc ^ 1 1871- Colonel Political A., March 1872, No. 369. Belly, then British Resident at Bushire, addressed the Bombay Government on the subject of a complaint made some months previously by the Chief of Abu thabi regarding the recent settlement at Odeid in his territories. The Chief observed that this settlement was in many ways inconvenient to him, detract ing severely from the prosperity of his principal township, andaffording refuge to persons evading their creditors, &amp;c. 0 Colonel Pelly being uncertain whe ther Odeid did really belong to Abu thabi, and being desirous further of ascertaining whether the Chief’s appre hensions were well founded, directed his Assistant, Major Smith, when visit ing the Arab Coast, to inquire into the matter. • The conclusion arrived at by this offi cer was that Odeid did belong tom. 1£&gt;S ( 3 ) Political A., March 1872, No. 57*. No. 247-52, dated 11th March 1871. No. 26 of Slit July 1871. Abuthabi, and that the Cliief’s town ship was seriously injured in its trade, and in other respects by the new settle ment. Turther, that persistence in the maintenance of the settlement would sooner or later lead to collision by sea. Colonel Pelly having warned the Abuthabi Chief to abstain from action by sea, proceeded to institute farther inquiries on his own account. The information he collected showed that Odeid belonged to Abuthabi, and that the El-Katr Chief, whose territories were on one side contermin ous with the district of Odeid, ignored all connection with it. Under these circumstances, he wrote to the settlers at Odeid, cautioning them to conform to the rule of the Chief of Abuthabi within whose terri tories they had taken up their abode. On the 31st July Colonel Pelly wrote again, enclosing a report received from Major Smith on his return from Odeid. Since the date of his previous letter Colonel Pelly had taken every oppor tunity to advise a peaceful adjustment between the Chief of Abuthabi and the colonists at Odeid. Hitherto, his efforts had been successful. But the case now appeared liable to complica tion from the presence of a Turkish force on the coast. The position taken up by the Chief, which Colonel Pelly held to be reasonable and in accord with the facts, was briefly this :—That Odeid belonged to him ; that it had now been colonised by certain Arabs, who owed him allegiance; that in conformity with the terms of the maritime truce he had referred the case to the British Besident; and that having thus ful filled his trucial obligations, he claimed the right to move along his coast line and coerce the colonists unless they submitted to his rule. The Odeid colonists, however, con tended that Odeid did not belong to Abuthabi; they were desirous of living as an independent society under the trucial flag ; and they had been offered, but had as yet declined, the protection of the Turkish flag. The supposition was, that if Abuthabi now attempted coercion they would accept the Turkish flag, and so further com plicate matters, not only at Odeid, hut at other points on the Arab littoral. Bor instance, while on the one side a( 4 ) Chief willing to accept that flag for temporary purposes might argue that the Turkish expedition * was operating by land, and was therefore apart from the sphere of British policy and action ; on the other side, a Chief injured or ag grieved by such acceptance of Turkish protection might argue that the Turkish expedition reached the Arabian coast b y sea, and could not, except by means of such movement by sea, have placed itself in a position to foster dis sension among, or coerce, the littoral tribes. Under these circumstances, Colonel Felly asked for instructions as to the course to be pursued in dealing with the quarrel between the Chief of Abuthabi and the Odeid colonists. 5. From Major Smith’s report it appeared that that officer had personal ly discussed the situation with Sheikh Buttye-bin-Khadim, the head of the El- Kabizat at Odeid. He not only abso lutely refused to submit to Abuthabi, but stated that his people were in their own right at Odeid, and independent. The territorial limits of the colony were declared to extend from Ras-ul-Hala, midway to Wukra in El-Katr, conti nuously along the southern coast through Odeid to a point abreast of the island of Seir Beni-Yas. He fur ther claimed the island of Dalma and other islets within that circuit, hither to unquestionably belonging to Abu thabi. He asserted that this territory constituted the ancient homes of the El-Kabizat, which they would maintain against Abuthabi, who was not their Chief; that in short he, Sheikh Buttye, was the real Chief of the district; he would do everything that the Resi dent desired, and not think of break ing the peace at sea; in fact, he was so poor, as might be seen, that he had no power to do so; and as he had received a trucial flag, which he always hoisted at sea, he only looked to the British. He then admitted he had been offered the Turkish flag by the El-Katr Chief, but had refused it, saying he was under British protection. This, how ever, was clearly put forward in hopes of gaining his point in regard to casting off allegiance to Abuthabi. If his claims to independence were not re cognized by the Residency, there could be little doubt as to the course he would take. * At the time the Turks were operating against Nejd, and had brought troops by sea from Busreh to Lahsa.

On 1st October Colonel Peily wrote again, enclosing a translated purport of a letter received from the Chief of Abuthabi urgently desiring an intimation of the views of the Bri tish Government on the Odeid ques tion. Colonel Pelly feared that the matter w'ould now be complicated by the pre sence of the Turkish flag in the Gulf. Humours or reports had, on more than one occasion, reached him to the effect that the colonists at Odeid hoisted the Turkish fl ig on Fridays. These reports might not altogether be reliable, but they showed that the notion of claiming Turkish protection had been enter tained. At first no orders were passed, but the Bombay Government (No. 2581, dated 2nd May 1872) having, in consequence of a further letter from Colonel Pelly, pressed the matter, the Government of India issued the following instruc tions :— “ In acknowledging receipt of your letters marginally noted, relative to the dispute between the Chief of Abuthabi and the colonists at Odeid, I am directed by His Excel lency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council to intimate that as no attack has been made upon the Abuthabi Chief by sea, it does not appear that any action on the part of the Resident under the maritime truce is called for. It will be unnecessary for Colonel Pellv to interfere unless he apprehends a breach of the peace at sea between the parties, but he should report at once if there is any overt ac tion indicating the intention of the Turks to establish their supremacy at Odeid.” In explanation of these orders, it may be noted that Colonel Pelly, in his further letter above referred to, had pointed out that the Chief of Abuthabi was one of the Trucial Chiefs and had brought the Odeid dispute to his (Colonel Pelly’s) notice in virtue of the position of arbitrator occupied by the Resident in the Persian Gulf under the trucial agreement.* 7. Here the matter rested until the 7th August 1873, when Colonel Ross, w ho had succeeded Colonel Pelly as Resident in the Persian Gulf, forward ed a letter, dated 20th June 1873, from the Chief of Abuthabi, on the sub ject of the settlers at Odeid. Colonel Ross explained that the Chief desired to attack the inhabitants of Odeid by sea, as on account of the( C ) numerous creeks a land expedition was impracticable. He considered himself bound by his trucial engagements to consult the Resident, and obtain his previous sanction. The letter from the Chief merely begged that whaf was necessary might be done. Colonel Ross asked for instructions as to the reply which he should send. Subsequently, in a report dated 20tll Progs., Political A., November 1873, No. 101 August 1873, Colonel Ross wrote as follows :—• “ It is almost certain that in the present position of affairs the Turks would not send a hostile expedition against Abuthabi, or any other Oman seaport. If any despatch of troops in that direction be contemplated, it will doubt less be under cover of an invitation from the Arabs themselves, and it may be worth while to consider whether there is any likelihood of such an invitation being given. “ I consider that the present condition of the affairs of the Abuthabi Chief might lead to Turkish intervention in one of three eventu alities : — “ \sily .—The Arab settlers of El-Odeid might seek Turkish protection against the Chief of Abuthabi should the latter attempt to coerce them. “ Indly .—The Chief of Abuthabi might ask aid of Turkish troops or vessels to coerce Odeid. “ ^rdly .—The Chief of Abuthabi mi&lt;*ht be induced to invite Turkish intervention in the affairs of Oman. “ I am disinclined to think this Chief would be so reckless, but the Oman Arabs are noto riously short-sighted, and will often sacrifice much for momentary gratification. Sheikh Zaid-bin-Khalifa cherishes the most bitter hatred against Debaye on one side. On the other side, he is discontented about the forts of Bereymee. In former times Sheikh Zaid exer cised much influence over a branch of the Naeem tribe which now holds Bereymee. He was in the habit of visiting that place yearly and residing in the fort, but latterly he has been excluded. It is not to be overlooked, there fore, that an understanding between Sheikh Zaid and the Turks, with the object of placing Bereymee in the hands of the latter, might have attractions for both sides. “ In September of last year, the Chief of Abuthabi, when on a visit to Muscat, in formed me he had a letter from some Turkish authority, which he viewed as an invitation to recognize the supremacy of the Ottoman Gov ernment. A report of this was made and for warded to the Government of Bombay by the Resident with his letter No. 1613-443, dated 5th October 1872. Sheikh Zaid afterwards, I recollect, personally consulted Colonel Pellv as to what reply he should send to the said letter. “ There is no doubt, I think, that the Turkish Arabian authorities consider both Abuthabi and Bereymee as portions of the province of(!!!) h ic» ( 7 ) Progs, Political A., November 1873.

Nejd, and that they would gladly seize any favourable opportunity of possessing themselves of especially the latter place.” In reply * the Government of India referred Colonel Ross to the instructions which have been already quoted in para. 6 of this note. They added that no answer need he given to the Chief unless he pressed for one. In this event he was to be told that not only would the Government of India give no coun tenance to any expedition on his part by sea, but that they would take active measures to prevent it. 8. In September 1873 Colonel Ross forwarded a letter from his Assistant, Major Grant, reporting information acquired on the Oman Coast con cerning the alleged design of the Turkish authorities to extend their influence to Oman. Translations of letters to the Chiefs* of Debaye and Abuthabi from a Turkish officer nam ed Yusuff Effendi, and of a letter to Colonel Ross from Sheikh Zaid-bin- Khalifa of Abuthabi, were attached. Colonel Ross wrote:— “ It appears from the correspondence that the Turkish authorities of biejd are endea vouring to establish a friendly understanding with the Trucial Chiefs of Oman for political or commercial purposes. According to the wording of Yusuff Effendi’s letter, the latter object is in view; but at the same time I un derstand the words used to inquire after rates and f news' taken in conjunction may refer to the state of affairs of popular feeling. “ It will be observed the Chiefs of Debaye and Abuthabi disclaim any wish to enter into relations with the Turkish authorities, and I feel sure none of them would at present trust themselves in the hands of the Turks. “ I do not feel sure that the Chief of Abu thabi does not know more about this Turkish correspondence than he pretends. Expressions in Yusuff Effendi's letter to him might lead one to think previous letters had passed, and it is somewhat significant that the Turkish officer should wish this Chief to write letters to the others. “ YVhilst these letters do not themselves prove any intention of theTurks to interfere poli - tically in Oman, yet, coupled with the generally received reports, I think there is ground to view their operations in that quarter with vigilant distrust. “ It is for Government to decide whether it would be advisable to obtain from the Turkish Government an explanation of the proceed- ings.”( 8 ) 9. In November 1874, Colonel Eoss reported that occasion had arisen for tak ing action in accordance with,the instruc tions of the 27th October 1873, cited at the end of paragraph 7 of this note. The Chief of Abuthabi had again re ferred to his wish to coerce the Odeid settlers by sea, and had been told that the Government of India could not permit such a proceeding. Sheikh Zaid then observed that the Turkish Government claimed Odeid as under their protection, and that Turk ish local officials had written to him to that effect. He professed to have mislaid their letters, but promised to forward them when found. It seemed to Colonel Ross probable that the Sheikh of Odeid, fearing an attack from Abuthabi, might have had recourse to the Turkish authori ties, and that the letters referred to by the Chief of Abuthabi might have been the result. The Government of India approved Colonel Ross’s proceedings, and decided to await a further report in regard to the written offers of protection alleged to have been made by the Turks to the Sheikh of Odeid. On 20th March 1875, Colonel Ross recurred to the subject of these letters to the Chief of Abuthabi. Zaid declar ed that he could not find the letters ; their ‘purport, however, was that he should abstain from interference with Odeid. Colonel Ross also sent translations of letters which had passed between the Sheikh of Odeid and himself on the subject of the Sheikh’s apprehensions of being attacked by Abuthabi. It appeared that the Sheikh pos sessed both a Turkish flag and the Arab trucial flag, and that he used the one or the other as occasion required. 10. In 1876-77 various piracies were perpetrated from Odeid territory and the tribe of Beni Hajir were at first supposed to have been the offenders. In the course of inquiring into these outrages it was ascertained by Captain Guthrie, of the May Frere, that the Sheikh of Odeid paid an annual tribute to the amount of 40 or 50 dollars to the Turks through the Chief of El-Bidaa. Nevertheless during the whole of Cap tain Guthrie’s visit the Sheikh con- Proceedings, Political A., December 1874, No. 148. From Resident in Persian Gulf, No. 1313-274, dated 21 st November. Proceedings, Political A., May 1875, No. 344. To Secretary of State, No. 78P., dated 10th May 1877 (Political A., May 1877, No. 304).tinned to fly the Arab Trucial flag and not the Turkish flag. Two or three years ago four Turks had come to Odeid by steamer and settled terms, but had never remained there any time. Subsequently, it appeared that tbe piracies under investigation had been perpetrated by the A1 Morra and not by the Beni Hajir; that the Sheikh of Odeid was not implicated, but that he was too weak to prevent his ports being made use of. Captain Prideaux, who was then acting as Resident in Colonel Ross’s absence, wrote:— . Accompaniment to letter No. 211, dated 16tb September 1876. Foreign Department No. 974P, dated 7tb May 1877. Despatch No. 78 P., dated 10th May 1S&lt;, 'Although the previous accounts of these out rages were exaggerated, there is sufficient evi dence to show that since the relaxation of British vigilance upon the Guttur ( El-Katr) Coast, consequent on the assumption of autho rity in that quarter by the Porte, the wild and lawless tribes of the mainland have more frequent opportunities than formerly of indulg ing their piratical propensities. I do not think the Chief of Odeid can justly be held accountable for these specific acts of violence; but it is quite clear that he is unable to res train the Bedouin tribes who find in his ports a convenient shelter from reprisals and punish ment. The Agent on the Arab Coast, whom I have summoned to Bushire, will endeavour to effect a reconciliation between the Chief of Abuthabi and Odeid : but if his efforts should prove .unsuccessful, it might be worthy of con sideration whether the authority of the British Government should not be exercised in restor ing the former Chief to his legitimate position at Odeid, and coercing, if necessary, the seceders from his tribe. No acts of piracy are ever reported from the districts ruled by the Chiefs under treaty obligations to us; and it seems anomalous that the civilizing policy of Government should be neutralized by an event which, as I have shown in my memo randum on Odeid, is not a novel occurrence. Although the Chief is said to have a Turkish flag in his possession, it would be scarcely probable that the Porte would advance any pretensions to Odeid, which, until the last few years, was indisputably an integral portion of Abuthabi territory.' “ The Government of India concur red in this view and empowered the Resident to use his best endeavours &lt;f to promote a reunion between the colonists at Odeid and the main body of the Beni-Yas tribe of Abuthabi,” and further authorized him “to afford assis tance, if necessary, to the Trucial Chief of Abuthabi in coercing the seceders.” In reporting the papers to the Secre tary of State the Government of India wrote as follows : — “ 2. From the present letter from the Officiating Political Resident and from the( 10 revious correspondence on the subject, the ollowing facts appear to be established :— “ (1.) That the acts of piracy complained of /ere committed by members of the A1 Morra ribe, a tribe nominally dependent on the ’urkish Government. “ (2.) That the pirates proceeded on their expedition from ports belonging to the Chief of Odeid. “ (3.) That the Chief of Odeid in no way countenanced or assisted the use of his ports as a starting place for piratical expeditions. “ (4.) That the reason why the Chief of Odeid is weak is' that he and his followers are a small colony of discontents who have seceded from the main body of the great Beni-Yas tribe of Abuthabi. “ (5.) That the reason why the Chief of the Beni-Yas tribe has not brought his refractory colonists into order is, that he has been preven ted from so doing by the British Government. “ 3. Under the circumstances above set forth it appears desirable that— “ (1.) Endeavour be made to induce the Turkish Government to take measures to res train the piratical proceedings of the A1 Morra tribe; and “ (2.) That measures be taken by ourselves to prevent the ports of Odeid being used as a rendezvous for pirates. “4. In regard to the action proposed to be taken through the Turkish Government, we have to solicit the assistance of Your Lordship and of the Secretary of State for Foreign Af fairs ; in regard to the ports of Odeid it is clear ly to the interest of the British Government, as guardian of the place and protector against outrage in the Persian Gulf, that each of the trucial tribes of the littoral should be strong and undivided; while it appears but equitable that the Government which prohibits the Chief of Abuthabi from bringing his refractory tribesmen into order should secure him their submission and allegiance, either by peaceful, or, if need be, by coercive measures. We have therefore, in our letter No. 974P., dated 7th May 1877, to the Resident of the Persian Gulf, empowered that officer to use his best endeavours to promote a reunion between the colonists at Odeid and the main body of the Beni-Yas tribe, and have further authorized him to afford as sistance, if necessary, to the Trucial Chief of Abuthabi in coercing the seceders. We trust that the above instructions will meet with the approval of Her Majesty^s Government. “ b e G n mentioned as a possible source of difficulty in procuring the submission of the colonists of Odeid that their Chief, who has been in communication with the Turkish Government at Lahsa, may at the last mo ment hoist the Turkish flag. But seeing that the British Government has received no official intimation on the subject, and that there is no tangible evidence that the Chief of Odeid is mder the effective suzerainty of the Turkish &gt; 0 vernment, we apprehend that the mere hoist-t 11 ) No. 62, dated 4th October 1877 (Political A., February 1.878, Nos. 268-269.) ^ # * No. 146, dated 15th June 1877 (Political A., February 1878, No. 255). f From Resident’s No. 159, dated 21st June 1877 (Poli tical A., February 1878, No. 257). ing of the Turkish flag need in no way restrict the freedom of our action in the matter.'^ 11. Upon receipt of these papers the Secretary of State entered into correspondence with the Foreign Office and advised that the English Ambassador at Constantinople should he directed to call the serious at tention of the Turkish Government to the increase of piracy along the El-Katr coast, which had re sulted from the extension of Turkish authority in that quarter ; and that he should intimate the resolve of Her Majesty’s Government not to permit the peace of the Persian Gulf to be disturbed by expeditions proceeding either from ports like El-Bidaa in actual Turkish possession, or organized by tribes recognizing Turkish suprem acy, and despatched from the terri tories of independent Chiefs too weak to prevent the abuse of their ports. He further advised that no refer ence should be made to Odeid, be cause it was doubtful whether the Turkish Government exercised any substantial authority over the Chief of that place, and it was inexpedient to provoke a discussion on the point. The result of Mr. Layard’s remonstrance was that the Turkish Government de nied all knowledge of any piratical out rages on the El-Katr coast, and asked for particulars. In reply, the India Office referred Lord Derby to Captain Prideaux’s letters of August 1876 and February 1877, and suggestedthat these should be furnished to Mr. Layard for the information of the Turkish autho rities. In sending this correspondence for the information of the Government of India the Secretary of State “ inti- “ mated the approval of Her Majesty’s “ Government of the instructions issued “ to the Kesident in the Persian Gulf, “ under date 7th May 1877, with a view “ to prevent the post of Odeid being used “ as a shelter for pirates.” No further correspondence on the subject of Odeid has been received from the Secretary of State except the despatch of July 1878, now under consideration. &gt; 12. In June 1877, the Kesident described the measures taken in pur suance of the instructions,* dated 7th May 1877, cited in para. 10 of this note, and a few days later he reported the details of an outrage by sea committed by Odeid boats upon a Wukra boat in the preceding April.f The up-( 12 ) shot* was that Captain Pri- deaux rejected the conditions on which the Odeid Chief was willing to be reconciled with Abuthabi, but advised him to accept a peacefnl settlement, upon terms to be approved by the British Resident, and warned him that if he persisted in refusing, the British Gov ernment would be obliged to take other steps. At the same time he wrote to the Abuthabi Chief, informing him that the Government of India had deter mined that Odeid should again submit to his authority and was willing to support his efforts to effect that object. It was desirable that the end in view should be obtained by peaceful means ; but if Sheikh Buttye refused to listen to advice, further steps might be necessary. Meanwhile the Chief of Abuthabi was to do nothing without previously consulting the British Agent at Shargah ; but he might rest assured that in a short time his authority would be fully re-established at Odeid. In the Wukra affair, the Resident ordered the Odeid Chief to release forth with the persons captured, and warned him that further notice would probably be taken of his conduct. The Govern ment of India decided to await a further report showing the course pursued by the Chief of Odeid in the Wukra matter, but passed no orders in respect to the dispute between Odeid and Abuthabi. 13. In October 1877, Mr. Aitchison resumed charge of the Foreign Depart ment, and shortly afterwards the Sec retary of State’s despatch, cited in para. 11 of this note, in which he approved the instructions issued to Colonel Prideaux, was received. The Resident in the Persian Gulf had also replied regarding the Wukra affair, stating that the Odeid Chief,while admitting that his people had forcibly captured persons on board the Wukra boat, had written an exculpa tory letter, and had altogether ignored the direction to release his prisoners. He had, therefore, called upon Odeid to say explicitly whether he intended to obey or not. Mr. Aitchison thereupon pointed out that, as regards Odeid, the Government of India were in the humiliating position of having made two demands—one in respect to Abu thabi, and the other in respect to Wukra—which had not been complied with. Ho also commented on the new phase on which our policy had entered * For details see notes recorded in K. W. No. 1, No*. 260, Political A., Februarj 1878. N °- 2063P ’ dated 22nd August 1877 (Political A., February 1878, No. 260).( 13 ) I * No.282, dated 15th December 18f7. „ 65, dated 6th April 1878. in the Abuth&amp;bi affair. He advised as follows :— “ I would therefore instruct the Resident to satisfy himself as to the facts of the occur rences at sea in violation of the * Maritime Huce, for which the Chief of Odeid may fairly be held responsible. If the Chief’s reply to his i. e ^ r satisfactory, to let the matter drop; if it is unsatisfactory, then to send a ship-of- war to Odeid, and exact reparation by force, inis done, if Odeid voluntarily submits to Abuthabi, well and good; but we need take no further steps, in my opinion, to compel him.” This opinion was accepted, and the Resident was authorized—on the as sumption that he had satisfied himself that the Clref of Odeid had violated the ‘ Maritime Truce’—in the event of the Chief s final reply being unsatisfac tory, to send a British man-of-war to exact reparation by force. These orders referred only to the 'Wukra case. But while no further action was taken or intended to be taken in respect to Abuthabi, the instructions of May 1877 remained uncancelled. 14. On the 12th December Colo nel Ross, who had now resumed his appointment of Resident in the Per sian Gulf, telegraphed that his attempts to reconcile Abuthabi and Odeid had failed, as the Odeid Chief relied on Turkey. He asked for an Indian Gov ernment vessel in preference to a vessel of the Royal Navy. After some corres pondence he was directed to apply to the Senior Naval Officer for a vessel of the latter class, and the Teazev was placed at his disposal. Nothing more was heard from Colonel Ross until the Secretary of State’s despatch of July 1878 drew attention to the occurrences at Odeid. It then appeared that Colo nel Ross had written the two letters cited in the margin,* neither of which had been received. The first of these explained Colonel Ross’s telegraphic application for an Indian Government vessel. It also enclosed letters from the Chiefs of Abuthabi and Odeid. The former acknowledged Captain Pri- deaux’s warning that he was not to act -without consulting the British Agent at Shargah. The latter de clared himself to be “ connected with the Ottoman Government, from which we shalPnever deviate, nor can there be any alteration in our allegiance.” The second letter contains an account of the proceedings against Odeid, and may be read. The import-( u ant point is that the Chief of Abuthabi has formally recognized his responsi bility for the prevention of piratical expeditions from this part of the coast. 15. In replying to Foreign Depart ment letter, No. 255 C. P., dated 17th December, on the general question of Turkish jurisdiction, Colonel Ross takes up specially the position of Odeid, and brings under consideration the following points : — “ Firstly .—Whether Turkish authority has ever been actually exercised or established at Odeid. “ Secondly .—Whether by conquest of El- Hasa, or by occupation of El-Katr, just claim has been established. “ Thirdly .—Whether the wish of the inhabit ants can be deemed to establish a claim.” On the first point he reports that no overt action indicating the intention of the Turks to establish their supremacy at Odeid has hitherto been taken, and that no authority or jurisdiction has, as far as known, been ever established or exercised. On the second point he refers to Colonel Pelly’s correspond ence with the Chiefs in question, which has been noticed in paragraphs 4 to 6 of this note, and refers to the enquiry made in 1871, in which it was ascertained that “ Odeid forms no portion of Guttur (El-Katr) territory.” Upon the third point he writes as follows “ The third point suggested for considera tion is as to the bearing on the question of jurisdiction of the action of the Odeid people themselves. The desire of the Sheikh of Odeid has all along been to be treated as an independent Chief, and admitted as such into the circle of Trucial Chiefs under British pro tection. This privilege could not, however, be conceded without setting aside the asserted right of the Abuthabi Chief over Odeid and its inhabitants. The latter being the hereditary tribesmen and subjects of Abuthabi, their com plete independence could not be recognized. Under the circumstances, and considering the geographical position of the place, it does not appear to me that the Turkish Government would have the right to accept the allegiance of aliens residing beyond their frontier ; nor do I see how such a tender, assuming it made, could confer right of jurisdiction in this in stance. “ In addition to the considerations of a nega tive description which I have touched on, the positive claims of the Chief of Abuthabi in regard to Odeid must be considered. For more than a generation the Chiefs of ’ Abuthabi have claimed, and occasionally exercised, author ity over the place and inhabitants, who according to Arab ideas and custom were the dependents of the said Chiefs. The rights ofthe latter seem to have always heen recognised by the British officers in the Gulf, and the same view has, after many years of occasional correspondence, been practically approved by Government. It is probable that the Turkish pretensions lately put forward, at the instance of the local Sheikhs, are based on ignorance of facts. I ascertained last year that the Gov ernor of Busreh had never even heard the name of Odeid. “ As a matter of right, it appears to me plain that the Turkish Government has no valid claim to Odeid. Viewed as a question of policy, apart from the rights of Abuthabi, I consider it would be prejudicial to British interests and influence in the Gulf to suffer Turkish rule to extend to Odeid. The place would probably once more become a resort of pirates, for whose purposes it is admirably adapted, and some of whom have, since the abandonment of the village, transferred their base of operations to the vicinity of Kateef. Further claims and pretensions would ensue, extending probably to the adjacent islands, which might be regarded as pertaining to Odeid, and disorders would multiply in those intricate waters which we should be debarred from repressing, and which the Turkish local agents and protegds would regard with indif ference.” 16. The observations to be submit ted to the Secretary of State in reply to his despatch, dated 11th July 1878, might deal with Odeid somewhat as follows. The history of the proceed ings authorized by the Government of India might be continued from the period reached in Foreign Department despatch No. 78P., dated 10th May 1877, the policy of which has been approved by Her Majesty’s Govern ment, and attention be drawn to Colo nel Ross’s account of the operations of March last. It might then be ex plained that the Chief of Abuthabi is one of the Arab Chiefs bound by agreement with the British Govern- ment to maintain the maritime truce ; that this Chief cannot be held res ponsible for breaches of the truce by his subjects if he is prevented from enforcing their obedience to his autho rity ; that the Odeid people are his subjects; that the settlement they have established is within his territory: that 9f ' the settlers have repudiated their alle giance to him, while experience has shewn that even if they have com mitted no maritime outrages on their own account they have been utterly powerless to prevent their harbours and shore from being abused by pirates belonging to other tribes. Hence the claim of the Chief of Abuthabi to coerce( 16 ) Odeid was ret only within his rights, hut it w as expedient in the interests of order that those rights should be enforced and the authority over the Odeid coast and harbours placed in the hands of a Chief capable of exer cising an effective control. Then, as to the jurisdiction of Turkey over Odcid, I would point out that, inasmuch as Odeid belongs to Abuthabi, and as Abuthabi is a power with which the British Government has maintained direct treaty relations for many years, the pretensions of Turkey are inadmis sible. I w'ould then describe the vague and indefinite character of the Turkish claims. As far as is known the Turkish authorities have never taken any overt action indicating an intention to establish Turkish supremacy, nor have they ever exercised any juris diction. The most that can be said is that Sheikh Buttye has occasionally hoisted the Turkish flag, that he has claimed Turkish protection, and that he has latterly paid a small tribute to El- Bidaa. The existence of a separate and independent chiefship at Odeidhasnever been recognized, and the act of Sheikh Buttye in establishing a settlement there was in open defiance of the Chief in whose territories it was situated. All that the Sheikh of Odeid could do would be to declare himself and his followers, individually, if they agreed, under the protection of Turkey. This might, if the Turkish authorities were willing, entitle them personally to the good offices of the Porte, but it would certainly afford no valid ground for Tur kish interference with the territories of Abuthabi. 17. I now come to the second des patch from the Secretary of State, cited in paragraph 1 of this note, in which the larger question of the entire Turkish jurisdiction in these regions is raised. Upon receipt of this despatch the notes recorded in K. W. Secret December 1878, Nos. 2-11 were written, and the Government of India hav ing decided to consult the Besident in° the Persian Gulf an expression of Colonel Ross’s opinion was called for in Eoreign Department No. 255 C. P., dated 17th December 1878, which should be read. Colonel Nixon, also, the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, was told in a letter of the same date that the Government of India would be glad to receive any statement of( 18 ) « . t( ^3 ^ That assuming that the British Gov ernment see no sufficient ground for reassuming the supervision and control over the portion of coast in question, it would be best that the Turkish Government should undertake the responsibility and take effectual measures to maintain good order. “ But there is a point, of course, beyond which it would be impossible, consistently with the due maintenance of British rights and performance of our duties, to permit the fur ther extension of Turkish rule or influence. This line should, it appears to me, be drawn not far from Bl-Bidaa, the furthest point on the coast, to which the operations of that Gov ernment have extended. The adjacent town ship of El-Wkrau should, I consider, be re garded as accompanying El-Bidaa, and so included in the zone of allowable Turkish in fluence. The southern boundary of these dis tricts might be conveniently drawn at the 25th degree of north latitude.” 19. Colonel Ross next takes up the question of Turkish jurisdiction in Odeid; his remarks have been noticed in paragraph 15 of this note. He then sums up the Turkish position as shown on the margin, and recom mends that the British Government should take the initiative in promot ing a more settled and durable condition of affairs by negotiating for a demarca tion of the limits of the different juris dictions and spheres of influence and responsibility. He notices that a difficulty will pro bably arise in respect to the Turkish pretensions to Arabia generally, hut nevertheless advises that the Turkish Government should be invited “ to state the exact extent of the Arabian Coast for which they are prepared to accept responsibility and make efficient arrangements for the maintenance of order and prevention of maritime irregularities, the British Govern ment at the same time stating beforehand plainly the nature and extent of British para mount influence in the same coast, and the line beyond which this will be maintained. 1 he islands of Bahrein would of course be so reserved as well as the entire 4 trucial re&lt;non # including Odeid.” 20. The next question is what ac tion should he taken by the British Government in case of the maritime peace of the Gulf being broken by ex peditions proceeding from acknowl- ^ ur kish ports, and which the 1 urkish authorities are unable or un willing to put down. Colonel Ross considers it highly necessary to reserve the right &gt;ress by means of our naval force sue to such sup- irre- ;uW operations undertaken for marauding imposes in the high sea.” ^ “ To recapitulate the actual present position of the Tnrfcs on the Arabian Coast: from Busreh to Ojair the whole sea board continuously is fully recognized as under Turkish authority and administration. At El-Kateef and Ojair are Turkish garrisons and responsible Turkish officials. At El- Bidaa, on the east coast of El-Katr Promontory, Turkish authority is substantially, though less regularly, established. Between Ojair and El-Bidaa, no attempt has hitherto been made to establish or exercise Turkish jurisdiction.On the very important question of the effect which the recognition of Turkish rights and obligations will have upon the British and Persian Gov ernments, Colonel Boss writes :— “ There can be no doubt the appearance of the Turks in the Persian Gulf and their acquisitions somewhat curtailed the sphere of British control and limited our influence corres pondingly. But practically this was unavoid able ; and as w e have already for some years ab stained from the exercise of active control over that portion of the coast actually, or potentially, under Turkish rule or influence, the transfer of so much of our jurisdiction may be regarded as an accomplished fact. It having been apparent to all, from the outset, that the British Govern ment did not mean to oppose Turkish progress, where our own interests w T ere not materially concerned, 1 do not think that full recognition of Turkish rights and obligations now would injuriously affect British influence and prestige as regards our own reserved sphere. Again, were a clear understanding arrived at, as sug gested, and it being plain to the Turkish Government that no naval interference would be tolerated where we exercise authority and influence, there would be little inducement for the Turks to increase their naval force in the Gulf unduly, and the British naval force will remain as at present paramount. As regards Persia, its Government and coast authorities have become accustomed to the presence of British ships-of-w 7 ar, and recognize the advan tage accruing therefrom. They would certainly resent any attempt of the Turks to assume a similar footing, but I do not think the latter would see any inducement to do so.” 21. Paragraphs 22-24 of Colonel Boss’s letter discuss the question of pro cedure—that is to say, of the manner in which the Besident in the Persian Gulf deals with disputes, etc., involving Arab Chiefs with whom the Turks are con cerned. Broadly speaking, the proce dure followed is that described in para graph 9 of Foreign Department letter datedl7th December last, but no general rule has ever been laid down. It is wor thy of notice that Colonel Boss can find “ no instance recorded in which appeal to the Turkish authorities through the Political Officers in Turkish Arabia has elicited any satisfactory result.” 22. Colonel Nixon’s reply may be read. It does not deal in any con nected way with the question at issue, but appears to deprecate any action being taken likely to wound Turkish susceptibilities. The correspondence enclosed in Colonel Nixon’s letter is very voluminous; no attempt has been made to arrange it, and many of the letters are duplicates of communica-( 20 ) tions from the Resident in the Persian Gulf to the address of the Government of India, which need not have been sent. 23. The first question to be deter mined by Government is, whether the Secretary of State should be advised to propose negotiations for a demarcation of Turkish and British responsibility in the Persian Gulf and on the Arab litto ral. I take it, that the Government of India will decide affirmatively on this question, more especially as it is evident from the despatch cited in the margin* that the Secretary of State is ready to adopt such a conclusion. The next question is, as to the line which this demarcation should follow, and the nature and territorial extent of the responsibilities which will be held to devolve on the two Govern ments. Probably no better line could be taken than that suggested by Colonel Ross. It would, however, be necessary to make special arrangements in respect to the islands of Bahrein, and to deter mine as precisely as possible what action may be taken by the British authorities in the Gulf in regard to piratical expeditions having their base in Turkish territory. On these points I would suggest-^ i.—That we maintain the position that Bahrein is independent of every Government except that of Great Britain. # No. 7, Secret, dated 20th February 1379. ii.—That we guarantee to compel the Chief of Bahrein to observe his treaty obligations and to abstain from all inter ference with the mainland; but iii.—That if the islands of Bah rein are attacked by pirates, the Chief, acting under the Resident’s sanction, shall be permitted to take such mea sures for the defence of his territories as may be necessary, even to the extent of followino* up his assailants into Turkish jurisdiction. The peculiar situntion of Bahrein seems to me to render this last provision essential. The islands lie so near the mainland as to render them peculiarly liable to piratical attacks, while this same proximity affords the aggressors every facility for escape into° Turkish jurisdiction before they can be caught. vFor an instance in point, take the re cent raid on Azariah, while H. M. S. “ Spartan ” was anchored at Mena- mah, reported in the Resident’s letters and telegrams cited in the margin.* iv. —That pirates, whatever their nationality, caught by us at sea, and pirates followed up and caught by us within the territorial waters of Turkey, or on the mainland within reach of our guns, shall he dealt with under the orders of the Government of India. v. —That the British authorities shall not undertake operations on the mainland within the Turkish line; as the duty of destroying pirate strong holds so situated will devolve upon the Turkish authori ties. vi. —That the necessary represen tations to the local Turkish authorities shall be ordinarily made by the Political Agent at Bagdad. If, however, im mediate action is necessarv, they may be made in the first instance by the Resident in the Persian Gulf, who should in form the Political Agent at Bagdad of his proceedings. vii. —That in case of piracies com mitted from within their ju risdiction, the Turkish autho rities will enforce restitution of plundered property and payment of compensation. 24. With regard to the British juris diction and responsibility, I would sug gest— k That we retain our existing jurisdiction over the waters of the entire Persian Gulf. ii.—That we assume a complete protectorate over the islands of Bahrein within the Tur kish line. ih. That we allow no other power to interfere in proceedings on our side of the line, whe ther by land or water. It will, I think, be inexpedient to preserve any distinction between mara- time and land operations outside the limits now to he assigned to Turkey. If( 22 ) it is preserved, we shall have the Turks pressing upon the Trucial Chiefs from the land side, who will take advantage of a divided author it) to hoist the Tur kish or the trucial flag as may be con venient. As illustrations of this view, take the case of El.Bidaa, which has now become Turkish; and of Odeid, which attempted to follow the example set by El-Bidaa. I would, therefore, recognize the Trucial Chiefs as being wholly subordinate, and not only in respect to their maritime proceedings, to the British Government. At some future time it might be politically ad visable to amalgamate all these petty Chiefs with Muscat ; to assign the Sultan of Muscat the position of a feu datory chief with jurisdiction as far as the Turkish boundary ; and in return for this extension of territory, to take from him a tributary contribution to wards the maintenance of the Naval Squadron in the Persian Gulf. A revision of our agreements both with Muscat and the Arab Trucial Chiefs (including, of course, Bahrein), appears to me a question of the first im portance. It is due to the policy which the British Government have pursued for many years at heavy expense, and to the efficient naval police which we keep up, that piratical outrages have ceased on all that part of the coast subject to our influence. The result is, that the commerce of the Persian Gulf has developed to an extent which a few years ago would have been deemed impossible, and has been valued at eight millions Stirling.* Probably this esti- .. Throagh isUtic TurlM . mate is an outside one ; but there is no doubt about the magnitude of the Gulf Trade, and that it is steadily in creasing. The Trucial Chiefs and Muscat have all benefited enormously by the prolonged and settled peace wiiich our operations have secured. Nevertheless, not only do they contribute nothing towards the maintenance of a condition of tilings so profitable to themselves, but their very engagements with us omit all recognition of the British Gov ernment as the Paramount power. We have never exercised any right of so vereignty oyer them, ancl except as re gards maritime proceedings we possess no legal control over them. Hence, I venture to urge that the proposed negotiations with the Porte should be undertaken with the object, not only of limiting Turkish jurisdiction, but ofrectifying our own defective title, and securing on a valid international basis the position to which by our costly labours we are fully entitled. 25. Upon the question of the effect which a settlement with Turkey is likely to produce upon Persia, Colonel Ross touches very lightly. It seems to me, that a determination somewhat on the lines indicated of the position to be occupied henceforward by the Turkish Government in these regions, will accord with Persian interests. As long as the limits of Turkish autho- jdty remain undefined, plausible argu ments may be advanced for strength ening the Turkish Squadron on duty in the Gulf. An increase in the number of Turkish vessels in these waters would add appreciably to the Turkish power of aggression against Persia, at a point where the Shah’s capabilities of resist ance are especially feeble. But once those limits have been settled, there would be no excuse for an indefinite increase to the Turkish fleet in the Gulf, such as, for instance, was contem plated in 1871. It is evident, therefore, that the proposed settlement would be of considerable advantage to Per sia ; and we might point to its ac complishment as an additional proof of the friendly intentiousof Her Majesty’s Government towards that of the Shah. 26. I have adverted in paragraph 19 of this note to Colonel Ross’s antici pation that the claims of the Turkish Government to the suzerainty of the whole of Arabia will hinder the propos ed delineation of Turkish authority. In former days the Turks have assert ed that Nejd is a Turkish Province, that the Wahabee Amir is a Turkish official, and that Bahrein, Abuthabi, Debaye and other towns in Oman are included in Nejd territory. They might even lay claim to Muscat, which has paid tribute to Nejd. It does not follow that these pretensions would be revived, if the pro posed negotiations were set on foot. If they were, I cannot suppose that there would be any hesitation on the part of the British Government in re jecting all of them as firmly and con clusively as it has already rejected the claim to Bahrein. It would be an addi tional advantage arising out of the pro posed settlement if the internal as well as the maritime limits of Turkeyin this part of Arabia were perma nently defined. 27. The only other question for orders is the procedure to be followed by the Resident at Bushire and the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia in the transaction of business. It seems to me that, so far as they go, the in structions of 1862, extracted in Appen dix 4 of Colonel Boss’s letter, enunciate the proper principle. The difficulty is to say, at what point the conduct of cor respondence should pass from the Resi dent in the Persian Gulf to the Poli tical Agent in Turkish Arabia. I can think of no better rule than to say that all matters in which the Turks are concerned should be handed over to the Political Agent at Bagdad as soon as the emergency which has compelled the Resident at Bushire to address the Turkish authorities direct has passed away. The same rule applies mutatis mutandisto correspondence between the Political Agent at Bagdad and the Per sian authorities in Arabistan. Forth© rest, a great deal must be left to the dis cretion and common sense of the officers concerned, and to their maintaining, as directed in 1862, a constant and confi dential intercourse. Colonel Nixon, it will be observed, has applied for an ad ditional clerk to enable him to furnish the Government of India with copies of his correspondence with Constanti nople. Some assistance may eventually prove necessary ; but it will be evident that in the present instance Colonel Nixon has forwarded copies of papers which he might have known were already in our possession, and which at any rate he was not told to send, viz., letters received by him from the Resi dent at Bushire, and copies of letters from Colonel Ross to the Government of India. 28. I append a map, drawn by hand, which sufficiently illustrates the Persian Gulf and the neighbouring parts of Arabia referred to in this note. T. J. 0. P. The 2\st March 1879.Undeu-Secuetaht. This is a very good Note. I would certainly draft as you propose in regard to the Odeid case, in reply to Secretary of State—showing the reasons why the claim to regard Odeid as Turkish territory is very disputable, and adding that it would he doubtful policy to allow Odeid to secede from Abuthabi, one of our Treaty Chiefs, under the cloak of such a claim. We should explain our proceedings against Odeid; and the line indicated at pages 15—16 of the Note may be generally followed. But in our letter, 10th May 1877, we have already taken up the ground that there is no tangible evidence of Turkish suzerainty over Odeid. And Lord Salisbury, in his letter, 25th June 1877, to the Foreign Office, does in some sort of way appear to indicate that the Turks are responsible; though he does not object to our stopping piracies with out their intervention. His view is that that we can go on dealing with Odeid as suits us, even though Odeid hoist the Tur kish flag. If the Foreign Office does not object to this, it would suit us well enough. I doubt whether the Foreign Office will agree to 1 refuse the Turkish claim. Then as to the general question, we must draft on the time of discussing and examining the points noted by you in paragraph 21 and the following para graphs. I do not feel sure that we ought to propose a final demarcation ; and I am not sure that it is necessary, for the trade and maritime peace of the Gulf, to mark off and assert finally Turkish jurisdiction along the land. So long as we possess the power of direct interference to stop piracies and to hold the Chiefs responsible, we need not require more. If the Turks are gradually restricting this power, while they do not exercise it themselves, that is a practical reason for checking their extension of jurisdiction; but if they do not actually prevent us from doing as we think fit, it is hardly for us to mark off jurisdiction. And I should say their claim to all the intervening coast between Bidaa and Ojair would be weak, if it were only based upon claims to suzerainty over both those places. Have we no record laying down our established and continuous policy in regard to our relations with Turkey in the Gulf, and the limits which we have decided to maintain as independent ? Please speak to me early, before drafting. We ought to review the whole case as to policy from the beginning. See Prideaux’s suggestion, September 1876, about the Yemen precedent.his views which he might desire to • Resident, Bashire’s No. 30, dated 20th January 1879. Submit. The replies* received from P. A.

Colonel Ross has found the , same difficulty which troubled the Gov ernment of India in understanding the precise character of the reference made by Colonel Nixon to the British Ambas sador at Constantinople. He points out that we have not been engaged in any disputes with the tribes of El-Hasa; that interference in their intertribal affairs has been avoided ; and that every effort has been made to hold the Turks res ponsible for disorder in Turkish dis tricts. He then observes that if Colonel Nixon in writing of El-Hasa has in tended to include El-Katr, a mistake has been made. The Turks have sub jugated El-Hasa, and their military occupation of that province has in volved the establishment of their authority at Kateef and Ojair. In El- Katr, however, their authority was ac quired at a later period and iu a differ ent manner, viz by the invitation of the local Chiefs of El-Bidaa ; and with the exception of El-Bidaaand the immediate neighbourhood, no steps have hitherto been taken to establish Turkish author ity on the El-Katr coast. Strictly speaking, therefore, the continuity of \ the Turkish authority terminates at some point near Ojair, and from this point to El-Bidaa there is a tract where their supremacy has not been establish ed and which includes the peninsula on which Zobara is situate and which is headed by Ras Reccan. But having explained this distinc tion, Colonel Ross goes on to say that the Turkish Government may with some reason argue that “their present actual position on this coast does involve, con structively, domination over the entire tract lying between Ojair and El-Bidaa,” provided, of course, that no British rights or obligations exist with reference to this particular tract “of a nature to con stitute an obligation to oppose the full establishment of Turkish authority therein.” The conclusions at which he arrives are— “ (1). That failing the exercise of Bri tish interference there is no obstacle in the way of completion of the chain of Turkish occupa tion of El-Katr as far as El-Bidaa. . “ (2.) That the British Government is not bound by any existing engagements to oppose that proceeding.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00015d_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B126</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00015d</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B126</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'TURKISH JURISDICTION IN THE ISLANDS AND WATERS OF THE PERSIAN GULF, AND ON THE ARAB LITTORAL'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1879/1879</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-09-23T12:08:07</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (14 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: The foliation for this description commences at folio 108 and terminates at folio 121, as it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.

The memorandum then reverts to the original questions relating to Turkish jurisdiction and concludes that Odeid is not a part of El-Katr territory, and is part of Abuthabi territory and is therefore answerable to the Chief of Abuthabi.The memorandum then reverts to the larger question of Turkish jurisdiction and considers the area from Ojair [al-‘Uqayr] to El-Bidaa and noting that they were not considered to be responsible for that area, but could have reasonable claim to do so should they wish; it also discusses the possibility of negotiating a line of demarcation to show where Turkish jurisdiction ends and British jurisdiction commences and the need for the British Government to reserve the right to suppress maritime irregularities at sea. The memorandum concludes by considering whether the question of a line of demarcation should be put to the Secretary of State for India; how to ensure that Bahrein [Bahrain] is recognised as independent of all Governments except Great Britain; and what impact such an agreement might have on Persia.Accompanying the memorandum is a note written by Sir Alfred Comyn Lyall, Secretary to the Foreign Department, Government of India, 7 April 1879 which supports the proposals outlined within it.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign Secretary</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Under-Secretary to the Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign policy</topic></subject><subject><topic>International relations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00015d#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
