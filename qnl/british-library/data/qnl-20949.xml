British Residency and consulate-General, JL Bushire f May 1903. To The Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein. Sir, In reply to your letter No:74, dated 3rd instant f I am directed to inform you that any reasonable scheme for. improving the landing facilities at Bahrein would naturally have the Resident *s sympathy, but f at the same time it has to be considered that as the Chief of Bahrein levies the full duty of 5 per cent and a transhipment duty of 2* per cent ; it vjould ptimanly appear to be obligatory on him to provide^ fret of cost, reasonable facilities for the land ing and storage of cargo. Presumably,however, this is not to be expected of him,- and therefore&gt; if the state of affairs at Bahrein is to be im proved the only method of doing so will be by means of some such scheme as that now propounded in your letter under reference . .The Resident would therefore like to receivereceive 'some further information on the following points Whether the use of the landing stage is to he voluntary or not, that is to say may traders f who prefer continue to land their cargo unaer the existing arrangements airect at the Customs House; whether the scheme is acceptable to the traders generally; whether it is to be 'run* by the Customs farmers or by the Chief's own re present at ive^how the cargo is to be transferred from the new landing jLlace to the Customs House. The Resident does not understand that the proposed terms are intended to be an agreement between the Chief and the Iritish Government, 1 ut that the jarttes to the terms will be the owners of the pier and those traders who use the pier for landing and exporting goods.

To , ^ : V ; The Assistant Political Agent, BAHREI Sir, I am directed to inform you in reply to your letter Uo 104 Gated 30th May 1903 1 that if British subjects are to be compelled to use the pier.the Resident could not accept the agreement without a reference to the Government of Indies, Before he does this ,he would like to know if you are reason ably certain that the wharf and its connecting road will be built and maintained so as to serve its uses in a satisfactory manner,Has an estimate of the cost of the undertaking been prepared t and has the proposed site been carefully examined as to depth of water,nature of bottom etc?Unless the wharf is properly built and maintained.it seems to the Resident that it may be worse than useless and then we shall be committed to having to compel our traders to use it when they would rather not,How aoes the Sheikh propose to raise ' money and can you say whether the wharfage dues are such as to make it cheaper for the merchants use the ^wnarf than to keep to thf present sijstem?How do the European, &gt; traders %traders at Bahrein view the scheme?

So he has noted in his register that your official letter No. 278 is 'transferred to Hesident ,, , and to save time I have sent him your notes demi-officially, altered to memorandum form. I enclose copies of first and last page thereof so that you can make your record clear.

The talent^after personal examination of the locality, recommend as you will see, the combination, of a stone mole 870* long, with an iron pier with T.head, 800' long^at an approximate cost of if 1,70,000. With reference to paragraph 3 of Mackenzie's letter No.279 my adumbration of a Government loan, referred to by Mackenzie was simply a remark in private conversation that for a really business-li-Ke scheme uovernment might be willing to grant a loan ojx suitable terms. The lines which such might follow would I presume be somewhat as follows It may be taken for granted that Cjovernment will not grant a loan to be expended by Shaikh iisa, perhaps an unsatisfactory result. The grant would, I think, involve approval of the terms 1W V of a contract to a building engineer and superintendenfce and disbursement of expenditure by the Assistant Engineer for the (iulf, and the money would have to be refunded by monthly or quarterly instalments payable from the Customs receipts or by the Shaikh to the Agency to Government account. You will see from the old correspondence of GasKin's time Major S.G. Anox, that Political ^gent, BAHREIN.that Government were consulted before as to the details by which the cost of the &amp;x pier would be recovered, and they will consequently wish, no doubt, to be similarly con sulted in the present case. iVhat, therefore, seems necessary for you to do, is to explain Cray's report to ShaiJth i^sa, deviee a scale of sur charges which would pay the interest and eventually clear off the capital, and if Shaikh Esa cannot put up the money, frame a proposition from him or for him for the execution of the work by funds obtained by a loan from Government or from outside under suitable guarantees. The great tiling in order to enlist Government support is to put up a complete scheme which does not need more from them than an intimation of their acceptance or the reverse. / 2 --t/Y /- Lj*^&gt; i*j r fSt*-- ^ 1 f c ' ' ^'vv .L,. / 3/// jn ^ PQ Jr Lj. cJ/zr ^ ^ %* l/ v.,// ■' ^ ^ ^ecfJC 'Ay tu ^//c L .Copy of a demi-official letter dated 21st May 1910, from Lieutenant-Colonil P.Z.

On the 27uh Hay last you addressed me demi-of ficial ly on the subject of a proposed pier at Bahrein, stating the Shaikh was inclined to seriously consider the* project with a view to the more expeditious handling of cargo. Tly Assistant Mr, Storrs was called on to send in the necessary plan of site, and section along 'ohe most suitable alignment which is ITorth-Vest. On receipt of same and after a personal inspection of site and studv of local conditions I had a rough estimate pre- C/ T pared, the amount of which is as follows:- Stone mole,. Ks. 40,000. X. ron p i. er............ . i-S. 1,10,000. Tram line k rolling stock..... .fis. ^0,000. Total ..te. 1,70,000. 3. The proposals are to construct a masonry mole about SVO 1 in length, 20* wide, with the crest 4* above high water level, this would extend to low water mark. 4. From this point outwards an iron pier with wooden decking is proposed, and will be about 800* in length, with a Gross T head about 100* long - making a total length in all from the shore end, of about 1670* which is the least that will suffice to give a depth of b-g- 1 at low water along the T head. Such pier will also be 20* wide, the minimum necessary,-with the top at the same level as the mole. 5. Three cranes are proposed for dealing with heavy loads, at head of pier, and at the dumping sites. 6. The tram lines (double) will be gauge, and the rolling stock consist of 40 open topped trucks, which should be ample f of- merchandise noted in Captain Mac k enz i e * s memo r andum.7. Ky figures of cost, are very rough and approxl-, mate, but as the total is fairly large, before wor!-. ing up detailed pla.n3 and e3'uirn.aues 9 i'u na^ plGase be ascertained whether the amount involved will be forthcoming.Brioisli Residency and Consulaoe-General, s Busnire, June 1911, Please refer to Knox's deir.i-official of 29th January 1911, regarding Manama pier.

You will remember that in March Major Knox spoke to you on the subject of the proposed pier at Manama, and explained the views of Government on the subject. The cost is restimated at ^ l,70,ooo. It was suggested that either you should provide the money yourself, or obtain by a loan from the local merahants, or by a loan from the Government of India, i suitable arrangements being made for the ^/-payment of interest and the re-payment of the capital by the surcharge of fees for the use of the pier. It was also explained that the Indian Government, should it be asked for a loan, would wish : - (1). To be consulted when contracts for the work were drawn up. (2). To supervise the execution of the work, through an officer of the Public Wokks Department of India, so as to ensure that it was satisfactorily and economically carried out. |3). To be guaranteed the re-payment of the loan by instal ments payable monthly or quarterly. You promised to make known your views after consideration, and you will remember that i brought the matter to your notice again recently in an interview. I shall be much abliged if you will kindly let me know your views so that I may communicate them to the Government of India. (signed) / D. L. R.

Sir, 7 our most obedient servant, //3 A P &lt;f2c Lt-Colonel, j-olioical ■. esicent in the Persian Gulf.Bahrein, 23rd November 1916. Dear Captain Loch, When oir Percy Cox canae here the other day I talked • #. to him about the necejoity of extending and improving the Cuatoms Pier, as it always requires repairs for which we spent about Rs.2000 yearly, and'he asked me how much money would oe required for it. I said that I had no experience of such work 'but that I would be able to say after going to Karachi and consulting Engi neers with a view to making the Pier like those in India. I also said that if we had say Es.60,000 we would start the work, and that we would require a loan to be raised from local and foreign subjects here. Sir Percy quite approved of this idea and told me that we could arrange the matter; but when I pointed out to him that I wondered whether foreigners would agree to an increased rate of Pier Fees which would be necessary to pay up the loan as soon as possible, he said that it did not matter if rates were somewhat increased. I and Mr.Yousuf Kanoo went to Mohrag the day-before-yes- terday and collected a sura of Bs.35000 from Arabs, of which Sheikh Isa subscribed Bs.10,000. We are now going to approach foreigners for lUrther subscriptions. We purpose increasing the Pier 'Fee to Rx ^ Anna on small packages and 1 Anna on big packages from 1st Rabi Avval 1336 till the whole amount of the loan is made up. Yours sincerely,This inoming I v , r ent to see tli© present Customs pier and godown ,30 as to have some idea of the locality, Mr Maharaj and his brother showed me round. They said their idea was to widen and lengthen the present oier by about 15ft and 00 ft respectively , and build up the outside walls of pukka stone to obviate an oft recurring repair bill for damage dona by boats banging into the wall. They had no estimate but proposed to get one made by an engineer »Yho was to be brought from India.. They said the idea wa i to &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; facilitate landing when there was a rush ,such as th t caused oy heavjr cargos of rice, 5444^ and that if there was money to spare a STti&amp;Sh roof would be put up tai the pier so as to save goods unloaded in wet weather. I sked whether he did not think a better plan would be to provide better means than donkey a for taking the goods to the main godown, i.e. a train , but he aaid that v/ould be too expensive. Otherwise I mad e nil comment, I am not altogether sure this scheme is not a plaiit to compensate for recent lean years. 1.18.16mmTranslation of a letter dated 7th Safar 1336 (= 3rd December 1916) from His Excellency Shaikh isa bin Ali Al Khalifah, Chief of Bahrain, to Captain P # G.Loch Political Agent, Bahrain. oOo I have the honour to enclose herewith a copy of the agreement arrived at willingly among the principal mer chants in connection with the improvement of the building of the present pier and effecting its building with square stones which your friend has agreed to and allOvved. Doubtless it was the intention of your friend to complete its building as above stated; but I regret that this un fortunate war obliged me to delay the same owing to short funds. However, fortunately now the aforesaid agreement has been obtained with which I hope, you will be pleased, and approve of, as there is obvious benefit in respect of the protection of goods (merchandise) and the progress of commerce. It is also the first act of union and co-operation which has been obtained among the merchants in upholding the advantageous reforms for the territory. • I do not forget to mention that this favour is due to the two honourable men namely Haji Yousuf bin Kanoo and Seth Tirdass Saharaj, t e Director of my Cus by whose efforts Vie aforesaid has been arranged.

It is a matter of congratulation that, undor Your Excel lency's guidance, such alvunion of the merchants for aid ing one another and upholding the advantageous reforms for the territory has taken place and if God is willing the matter will be carried to a favourable conclusion. May I offer Your Excellency my best wishes for the suc cess of the^Bchem©# As regards the proposal for paying off the loan by an increase of the fees when a real benefit by the im prove nent of the pier has been conferred by means of the loan it seems to me just that the loan should be paid off in such a way but it is no doubt clear to Your Kxcellencjf that, before the payment of increased dues by foreign subjects is sanctioned by the High G vemment, I must be in a position to assure the Hon'ble Sir Percy Cox that foreign subjects will receive a benefit which will jus tify the payment. In conversation with Your Excel ency ^ understood that it is intended to summon %n engineer from India who will make plans and submit estimates for the work in accor dance with the customs of business in such matters. When the engineer comes Your Excellency will no doubt favour me with full information as to what plans and estimates he submits, and I will lay the matter before the llon'ble Sir Percy Cox in detail so that he may 3 now what benefits Your Excellency's scheme will confer on the merchants and be able ac ^iesce, if pro] er, in the paymentTEL^GRA J.

My dear Captain Loch, With reference to the question of pier fees, the matter could he easily settled between you and Sheikh Isa ah out the levyinr: of any fees, as the latter will doubtless comply with your wishes, but what I would supgest is that orders may be issued that all exportation cargo should go on the pier ^s:£&amp;e before being loaded into boats, ai this rule to stand good at least till the end of war. By this the Customs will not only be able to know exactly what is going out and to which places but also will be able to supply you with more accurate figures for your Trade Statistics. They will also be able to preve~nt shipments from going to enemy countries and will be responsible for everything. Yours sincerely. Yousuf bin Ah.iied Kanoo.Shaikh 'Abdullah came to see me on behalf of his Father and explained that what was meant in the letter regarding the pier tax was that in addition to the import pier tax there should be an export pier tax of the same amount to help pay for damage caused by exporters' boats, but that the latt r tax should only be on goods actually exported from tne pier. 7e agreed that another letter should be written to me to the above effect , and that when the engineer came and had examined the ground , both Shaildi 'Abdullah and I should accompany him to the pier and see what could be done for the money at our disposal.

Conditions of port and our position are changed for the better since Residency 455 of 1912 and if Political Agent is satisfied that bundobast is sound and amount raised reasonable I think foreigners should be called upon to pay same as others.
