From— Zair Khidhar Tangistani, To—His Excellency the Darya Degi, Governor of^Bushire. I trust that your shadow of kindness will not grow less over my head. Secondly, at the beginning when the British landed troops at Bushire and arrested the German Consul, what claim had they against a neutral country ? When Your Excellency left for Bushire, we knew that the British were play ing tricks, and that they would never quit Bushire, and return the 3 Germans. They have made Bushire their o wn property, and desire to advance still further inland. Had we not agreed to peace with the English in the presence of the Ulama and the people, they would have certainly thought that we were oppos ing the enemy on account of our own motives, or at the request of another party. We wished it to become known to the people of Persia that we were serving our own Government and Nation, and that the British had betrayed and shown disrespect to a neutral country. They have dishonoured the people of Persia, taken away their guests and wish to subjugate their land, and thereby, besides having already dishonoured them, trample their honour under foot. ■/r j on -yO L*j j ( b wish j.:; ’.A FOREIGIT SECRETARY’S I -ir*.

These letters show Hat this Khan is maintaining his truculent attitude, and m these letters he is speaking in the name of the hostile Khans. The letters also show m what supreme contempt the Khans hold the Persian Government, and wnat a very exalted idea they have of their own importance. 1.

Negotiations have been carried on with Tehran, Shiraz, etc. Although we knew that the British were playing tricks with our Nation up to to-day, we have not taken a single step in deference to the request of the whole people. Now, praise be i* to God, it has become properly disclosed to the Nation that the British have occupied Busbireand still entertain hostile intentions. It is “politic” to hoist a piece of cloth on the flagstaff, and it is sarcasm to ask for a Persian Governor for Bushire. If the Ministers in Tehran say that there is nothing to fear, they are obliged to say that, or else afraid. We made it clear to all the people of Persia during these 10 days that it was to deprive the Persians of their lives and that our struggle for life was right. Thank God it has happened as we want and war is approaching. I beg expressly to inform you, and to state as a well-wisher that if affairs are going on smoothly at Busbire and the British are raising no objections against Your Excellency and wish you to remain there, you may follow their orders : we shall not blame you and will make no objection. It will not be hard for us if your 10 men threw in their lot with the millions and millions of British troops who are hostile to us. If you think that it is not desirable that you should act in these few days of life or death in opposition to a Muhammadan country, then keep aloof under some pretext or other. Tnshallab, another fight will take place and you should make your own arrangements. A letter has been received from Saiyid Murteza Ahrami stating that His Excellency the Governor had ordered that the Mujahids should not proceed to take action for a few days so that he might carry on his negotiations with Tehran. Here also a letter was received from the Salar-i-lslam, Shaikh Hussain Khan, stating that the telegraph line had been under the orders of the Nation, that at once 1,000 tufangchis should be sent for, and arrive from Dashti, that I should collect 1,000 men in Tangistan and that fighting was near at hand, and sufficient ammunition had been received. I sent him Agha Saiyid Murteza’s letter enclosed in my letter to him, and wrote to him that he should wait 2 or 3 days for the sake of the Agha and yours. I did not ask for more than 500 men from Dashti. In the. past days, we fought with the English only when we had 100 to 300 men. The reason was because we had not sufficient amount of ammunition. Now, thank God, we have obtained a quantity of ammunition. A large number of tufangchis were required, and please God, 'matters will be brought to a successful issue. On the one hand the people have understood that our exertions have been opportune, and on the other hand we have made preparations. Sub-Enclo. 2 to Serial No. 203. Dated the 15th (25tb ?)

Now too, whatever His Excellency the Sardar may lament and say it is 3 ust the same as we have seen before. It was necessary for us to submit so that this might be laid bare to the whole Persian Nation, and tnat it should not be said that so and so have personal ffruda^es. Fifty days have now passed, and we have got tired of talking and receiving replies. We could,, overlook it for another month : but it will be the same old “ necessary steps from Tehran. The British will go on in the same way as now, while we have not the least hesitation in fighting them, for the reason that it had never happened that ye were without our fighting amongst ourselves, which w'as far more severe and worse than fighting with them. 1 raise God, by the grace of God, from the day we began fightino* with them all those who had killed each other’s brothers and fathers are on friendly terms with each other, so that they might be thought to be from one father, and to have drunk the milk of one mother. In our enmity against the British this has been one great gain so that with all delight and pleasure we are willing as long as we live to fight them night and day. We wanted to speak in the name of both the Government and the Nation so that we might expose British policy to the Nation, though God is witness that they know well and are not blind, while we consider overselves, and still consider ourselves, one of the most ignorant of Persians. We keep in mind the kindnesses of the Sardar and will have patience for a little, so that he might not think that so and so did not allow him to settle down in his Governorship.

Y our are in good health. 130 days have passed up to this time without my having any news from you at all. Through fear of Mr. Chick you have not remembered me and rendered me glad for 4 months and 10 days. In short, the coming of the Sardar has had no effect other than a ridiculous piece of cloth on the flagstaff. Please convey my statement to His Excellency saying “ if we had told you not to go to Bushire because to-day is the beginning of our fighting, the whole Nation, Your Excellency and the Ministers, under compulsion, would have thought that we were slightly to blame at the begin ning of the fighting, or else that we had some self-interested motives, or that we had begun resistance at the request of another.” On the day when the German Consul, the merchants and the woman were arrested in our neutral land, we communicated an ultimatum to the English, up till then we did not know Wassmuss at all. If formerly it was plain to all Persians that England and Kussia have sent their troops into the land of Persia, and have totally destroyed the powers of the Persian Govern ment, and though the Ministers at Tehran, perforce used to say “ What is the matter ” and used to feign deafness and dumbness, yet _we are not obliged to see with our eyes and hear with our ears and say “ There is nothing the matter. ”4 Oh you ' Darya Begi, Sardar, who have gone to Bushire, fifty days have now passed s nee you have stopped us from our work of resistance and you have done no work which may produce a result. Perhaps you are under compulsion like the Ministers at Tehran, and cannot make things plain to the British. M e are not under compulsion, and say with a loud voice that if Bushire is a tributary of Persia and Persian soil, the flags of Germany, Turkey, Russia. Lngland and Prance should be hoisted side by side, and our guests who were arres- ted in a neutral land should be restored. B.ather compensation ]s due, which should be paid. If Bushire is theirs, and business is done, according to their orders and instructions, these are all mocking words and the English wil] laufrh at you in secret. However, we are not under compulsion, and say that either Sardar should be their tufangchi, or else resign this ridiculous appointment; otherwise we should hoist the flag of the several nations, and the English pay for their treachery. No one should think that we are sitting quiet and say, c ‘ What is the matter.” Inshallah, we have no need of Isfahanis, Tehranis, Qashqais, Dashti, Tangistan and Chahkutah 'vve ha've in all eight thousand tufangchis; Eorasjun also has got three thousand men. In the past fights from first to last, we did not go into battle with more than three hundred men. It was by reason of the scarcity of ammunition. But now thanks he to God, ammunition and supplies have been collected. All the tufangchis have been gathered. We will join battle with 100,000 English troops. 204 : No. Cf.-387, dated Buskire, the 15th (received 22nd) November 1915. From— Major A. P.

In continuation and amplification of my telegrams No 699-C., dated 10th instant, and No. 702-0., dated 13th ins tant, I have the honour to forward, for your information copies of letters from Shaikh Ja’far to His Excellency the Darya Begi, together with other correspondence as noted in the margin. In the first letter Shaikh Ja’far informs Darya Begi that certain things must be done otherwise the hostile Khans will attack Bushire, and promises to give His Excellency timely warning to enable him to quit. In his letter dated 10 th November, Shaikh Ja’far urgently recommends the Darya Begi to leave Bushire on the ground that the Persian Government has given orders that the British community should be arrested at all places in Persia, and Bushire will consequently be no place for His Excellency. Pro-5 bably the object of this is merely to get the Darya Begi to leave Bushire, so as to make capital out of it hy saying we have forced him to leave, etc. . already reported by telegram the Darya Begi informed me at an inter view that he did not believe the statement made by Ghazanfar and Shaikh Ja’far. At the same time he is uneasy, as he thinks that if he does not play up to Shaikh Ja’far and quit Bushire and join him, the latter will make it unpleasant for his c ‘ old wife ” (as he expresses it) and family who are at Shiraz. The request for the Darya Begi to leave Bushire is countersigned i&gt;y Muhammad Boras]uni and Muhammad Hussain, a truculent Mulla of Borasjun who is well known in these parts for his anti-British views. _ It may be of interest to mention that Zair Khidhar of Tangistan and Shaikh Hussain have assumed or have been granted the titles of Amir-ul-Islam (Commander of Islam) and Salar-ul-Islam (Leader of Islam) respectively. Possibly Shaikh Ja’far who poses as an upholder of the faith and a leader of “ Mujahidin ” may have given the titles. Or the Khans may ha^e assumed them to try and give a slight fillip to the flagging zeal of their tribesmen. Sub-Enclo. I to Serial No. 204. Letter received 6th November 1915. From— Shaikh Ja'fab, To—-His Excellency Darya Begi, Governor of Bushire. I have received your letter and am glad to hear the news of your welfare. As regards any fresh new r s from Shiraz, yesterday’s letters all state, in reply to my telegrams to Shiraz enquiring about the coming of the Soulet-ud- Douleh, that he is coming only to obey the orders of the Ecclesiastics and the safeguarding of the country. As to the details of the promise and undertaking which he had given, they are as follows. He had stated that either he would send 500 men to the Darya Begi in order to reassure the British and get Bushire evacuated, or else he would send 1,500 sowars to fight the British, if they do not evacuate Bushire. This is news from Shiraz. As to Tehran, a telegram has been received from Haji Seyyid Yusuf con taining a definite promise by the Prime Minister for the opening of the Ahmadi route, but conditional on the Mujahidins* attacks being stopped. As regards the Mujahidin, letters are being received most days from them intimating their intention to make attacks and saying that their patience should not be exer cised any longer. But I have restrained them with great difficulty, though I consider it difficult, in view of the arrangements which are to be seen, that I shall succeed in doing so throughout. Assuredly when they despair of the Government being able to get Bushire evacuated, they will certainly proceed to carry on their operations. In this case Your Excellency’s presence there will not be advisable : but I will inform you a little earlier, so that you may leave by any means you can, otherwise you will be in a difficult position. We will only wait for a few days, in order that we may see if the Government s promises will bear fruit or not. p ^—The Shiraz Mujahids have been dismissed owing to lack of money to meet their expenses, the delay in the business and other reasons. They have left, but they will be replaced by men from Dashti and other places. Sub-Enclo. 2 to Serial No. 204. Letter received 6th November 1910. ]? rom Shaikh Ja'ear (in the handwriting of Muhammad Reza Drisi Munshi of Wassmuss—except postscript), To—His Excellency the Darya Begi, Governor of Bushire. For the last few days I have ree 3 ived no letter from you, and I have no news of your welfare. I trust that your health continues good. I have thought it necessary to write this short letter to you, and I have no news of your welfare: I hope you are well. I now find it necessary b) trouble you briefly regarding the censorship of letters. According to the news6 T received by ns and to evidence, it still continues on toe parts of that paity (the British) in certain matters. Bor instance, the censorship of letters for the Ports still continues even if they be in the Post Office. Betteis on the persons of various men leaving or arriving there are being also examined. In aodioion to this, the official at Shief still looks at people s letters and opens them, and passes such of the letters as he thinks harmless. These proceedings have given rise to comments on the part of the Mujahids, who say that if these arrangements are to continue, _ there is no difference in the case and that they would again introduce a similar rule. It is quite evident to you that the Mujahids’ consent to remove the censorship was due to your assurances. Now that it has become clear that it still continues in force, they will certainly take action. Of course, if that party (the British) desire that the censorship should not be introduced again, you should at once recommend that all the letters for all places should be free to pass. I have stated this for your information. Please let me know of such other matters as you know. Have you received any good news from the Government or not ? P S .—This business of theirs has remained unsettled and in suspense like other matters, which have amazed the whole Nation. Nodody has yet been able to make out what are the intentions and objects of the Government. Sub-Enelo 3 to Serial No. 204. Dated the 2nd Muharram 1334) =(10th November 1915). From —Mirza Muhammad Khan 1 of Borasjun, To — His Excellency the Darya Begi, Governor of Bushire. Pirstly I pray always to God to grant you good health, _ Secondly, for some days past I have not received your esteemed letters. Seeing that the quarrel between Zaigham-i-JDiwan (Agha Khan of Shabankareh) and Ismail Khan had lasted for a long time, and the people on both sides had become tired, I had gone there, thinking that perhaps I should be able to stop the fighting and trouble between them. Praise be to God, through the blessing of Youi' Excellency’s good wishes, I stopped hostilities on both^ sides and also withdrew my men and came back to Borasjun. My journey took 11 days ; I left Borasjun on the night of the 17th ultimo, and came back to Borasjun on the night of the 28th. Por the present there is no fighting or trouble, and if Ismail Khan does not begin making mischief again, I am inclined to think that naturally a truce will follow, which may, I think, be converted into a reconciliation. In any case I have done my duty, and stopped all trouble. We must see what will be God’s will later. I did not write to you in the last few days because I was occupied in this affair. Now, prompted by my feelings of obedience to you and humility, I hasten to write this letter m order to remember myself to you, and that I may be honoured and favoured with an answer. J .... a ppears that the British are under a wrong impression throughout and still think that I am responsible for the prohibition against the Shief route whereas, if they do not know it, Your Excellency knows it well, that the maj i route or Shief route makes no difference to me, and that they make no difference to my people In fact the latter will be more satisfied with the use of the latter route. Therefore, they have made a clear mistake. If they gne the prohibition of the caravans as the reason, this prohibition is by the Nation and I have nothing to do with it. In any ease, I have thought it necessary to represent my opinion to you so that you may be perfectly aware. If I was tomysubjects tomake and wS^ k0n ° Ured lettRrS &gt; P.Y.—(On a separate piece of paper.)7 „ nH ^ fle Af n jf“ gt k eletter f“ ^gent and important matter came tb my notice.

From— Mull a Hassan Alt (by direction of the Ghazanfar), To—His Excellency the Darya Begl, Governor of Bushire. On the 3rd instant the Ghazanfar- us-Sultaneh sent for me to go to Borasiun about certain important matters. These were chiefly in connection with the caravan route. YEhen discussing matters secretly, Sarhan (of the Telegraph Office) arrived while Ave were holding a secret meeting in the entrance of the house._ Haji Wuthouq (Haji Abdur Nabi) and I got up and when their con versation was over, he (Ghazanfar) sent for us and we went in. He told me that either I myself or my brother, Mulla Ali Baz, should proceed to Bushire m order to communicate urgent nevus to His Excellency the Sardar. I said that I was quite ready to do that. Afterwards he said that Mulla Ali Baz should proceed there as he had no fear. The Sarhang’s (i.e., Superintendent of the Telegraph Office) business was that the British GoA^ernment has made a protest against the Persian Government, and demanded that the latter should either deport or arrest German, Austrian and Turkish officials in all parts of Persia, othenvise war would be declared, Then the Persian GoA^ernment without an answer having been given to the British, arrested British officials in all towns of Persia everywhere. At Shiraz the Consul, the Telegraph Signaller, the Bank Manager and their subjects have all been arrested. The gendarmerie was orderecf by the Government and Nation to occupy all the places occupied by the British. The gendarmerie liaA^e done all this by order of the Government and Nation. He told -me that t I should do something to let you knoAV, so that Your Excellency might make your own arrangements either to come back or to take precautions. It was imperative upon us to communicate this news to you, for the rest Your Excellency are at liberty to take your own course. I am uoav sending my brother Ali Baz to you, so that he may make you aware of the situation in Persia. Sardar Ashair is due to come to Borasjun, P.S. —The telegraph line cn the further side of Shiraz is cut. There is no line also on this side of Borasjun. The British do not know. Of course lines to Tehran and to other places must have been cut. This is the news of the Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh and the Superintendent. As they kept me for one night and sent telegrams to make enquiries from Shiraz, and an answer had been received. After a proper answer had been received, I wrote my letter, and sent off my brother at once. Sub-Enclo. 5 to Serial No. 204. Dated 2nd Muharram 1234—(10th November 1915).

I have received letter dated Abram, November 21st, from O’Connor in which he asks me to telegraph to you and Government of India following considerations :— Begins. The whole of the pre sent complications and difficulties in Pars are universally attributed to series of events which have taken place at Bushire beginning with arrest of certain German nationals on Persian soil and continuing with the occupation of Bushire, confiscation of moneys belonging to Chiefs, etc., • and deportation of Persian subjects. It is these events which have raised in Southern Persia a violent hostility against the British such as never before existed and which has now reached formidable dimensions and which is daily increasing and spreading. I venture to suggest that as a matter of common sense and policy no time should be lost in attempting to remove all existing causes of friction and in allaying these feelings of hostility. Such of the Khans as I have seen here assured me that they will welcome a friendly settlement on lines which I have already indicated and that once Bushire has been handed over to Persian Government’s troops and our troops except the ordinary Consular Escort with drawn they are prepared to guarantee absolute security at Bushire. And this guarantee they are, I believe, quite capable of making good. The main causes of friction between us and Khans and people of Southern Persia will disappear once such an arrangement has been arrived at and carried out.

From—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi, To—The IIonTle the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Basrah. (Repeated to Deputy Political Resident, Bushire.) Following summary of news recently received from Tehran. Telegraphing on 21st, Marling reported that Shah and Persian Government were genuinely alarmed at situation to which German intrigues had brought country and that the moment was favourable for discussion of terms for defensive alliance between Persia and Entente, and for rapid negotiations, as counter balance to vast and tempting promises held out by Germany. Marling pressed Foreign Office strongly tor authority to conclude alliance on Persian terms, as he considers chaotic condition of country must again eventually place the two Powers in control of its destiny. On 22nd Marling telegraphed that gendarmerie under Swedish officers had attacked Persian Cossacks at Hamadan. Fate of Consul unknown Later he telegraphed that gendarmerie was in open revolt under Swedes, and that they were holding Kum in German interest and had cut wires. Persian Govern ment indignant and waiting for definite declaration of our attitude. Unless encouraged, the risk appeared to be that Persian Government would pretend its hand had been forced and would go over to Germans. Please inform us whether Marling is still communicating with you in regard to Persian developments, and state whether interruption of central Persian line makes us responsible for keeping you informed.

Prom—The Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. (Sent to Tehran; repeated to Sir P. Cox and Foreign.) Please see my telegram immediately preceding. In regard to Major O’Connor’s message I beg to submit following obser vations :— A —X think that one can hardly say universally attributed”. —The Germans were arrested on Persian soil for very good reason? since, as shown by the correspondence sent to Foreign Department, Government of India, with SirP. Cox’s letter of March 26th, 1915, they had abused its hospitality. Major O’Connor, his telegrams 31 and 35, dated March 2nd and March 1th, 1915, him self °recom mended the arrest of the Germans on Persian soil. In fact it was a good move I think, the effect of which was only spoilt by the unfortunate escape of Wassmuss. The matter was in any case one for two Governments and not for local “ Com mittees ” and Khans. C —The occupation of Bushire was brought on four months after the arrest of Germans by the outrages committed by hostile Khans. As two of its objects were to secure punishment of the Khans and removal of (their ?) colleague it was naturally especially distasteful to these gentry, into whose hands Shiraz colony has now fallen unfortunately. 2 ) The deportation of the rabid pro-Germans was a natural corollary of the occupation of Bushire.4 » H .—Only moneys attached were those referred to in my telegram No. 710-0., and for reasons stated. Major O’Connor, vide my telegram No. 482, August 24th, himself recommended the attach ment of another man’s money. F. —There is no doubt great hostility exists, but I think that it is chiefly due to German agents and German money which pre viously had not been lavished in Southern Persia to such an extent and to complexion which those agents have been able to put on events enumerated. G. —As we have demanded punishment of hostile Khans they will no doubt {£ welcome a friendly settlement ” on lines that we give them (all they ?) want and abandon all idea of their punishment for outrages committed by them. H. —Guarantees given by hostile Khans are in my opinion absolutely worthless. As long as they remain unpunished and German agents are free to intrigue all over Southern Persia the British garrison is the only protection of British lives and property in Bushire. To withdraw it would, I am convinced, entail com plete evacuation of Bushire and abandonment of telegraphic and wireless telegraphy stations there. 118 Telegram No. 2262-W., dated the 24th November 1915.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. Please see my telegram 476. It is reported by His Majesty’s Consul, Bushire, that Major O’Connor, Bank Manager and Accountant and Indo- European Telegraph Department Superintendent and another officer together with few men of Consular Escort are now in hands of Tangistani Khans who demand in exchange for their release. (1) Belease Germans, Eisenhut and Listemen and of Persian prisoners captured in attack on Bushire by us. (2) Bestoration of certain monies belonging to two of the Khans which had been sequestrated during our occupation of Bushire at Imperial Bank of Persia. (3) With exception of ordinary Consular Guards from Bushire departure of all troops. Trevor considers that these demands are inadmissible. I agree with him generally except that I think that money might be perhaps restored eventually subject to any sums deducted as compensation for people who suffered during attack on Bushire. It is in my opinion unlikely that captives will be maltreated or put to death, first, because we are holding more prisoners of war on whom to make reprisals and, second, because Khans will wait to see what line Persian Govern ment will take and will be afraid that. Kawam or Soulet will be charged to exact the penalty from them, Persian Ministers confirm this opinion. Through Governor of the Ports of the Persian Gulf they are sending strong messages (to ?) Khans and if found necessary Shah will intervene himself. I have little doubt that release will be effected if our negotiations for the alliance make progress and meanwhile I think that we should not make to Khans any concessions.

Marling, Esq., C.B., C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty’s Envoy Extra ordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. I have the honour to enclose a translation of a letter from the two hostile Khans, Shaikh Hussain of Chahkutah and Zair Khidhar of Tangistan, which has been handed to me in original by Darya Begi, Governor of the Gulf Ports. They are two of the three remaining enemy Chiefs, regarding whom I have on more than one occasion reported that until they are removed perma nently from this region, by the Persian Government or other_ means, no security from violence can be guaranteed to the British community in Bushire and no safety for travellers or goods on the principal {i.e., Ahmedi-Borasjun) caravan route. Owing to lack of any offensive operations against them m their own districts, they are as little daunted, and as insolent in their demands, as if they had not incurred losses in their previous attacks on Bushire and were masters of the situation. The (l pressure threatened in the letter no doubt refers to raids by night on the outposts and the houses of British subjects and employes in the town. I trust that further evidence of the attitude of the Chiefs in the imme diate vicinity of Bushire—all the more detestable in Shaikh Hussain of Chahkutah in view of the good offices and kindness extended to him by the Residency for years-will determine His Majesty’s Government to insist on the removal of these Khans and the punitive measures involved on the first suitable opportunity whether before or after the termination of the war. Sub-Enclo. to Serial No. 199. Dated 19th Zihijjah 1333 (29th October 1915). p rom _SHAiKH Husain Chahkutahi and Zair Khidhar Tangistani, T 0 — TTjs Excellency the Darya Begi, Bnshire. We trust that your honoured health continues good. We have received your esteemed letter and we are greatly astonished at It -now 11 days since Your Excellency arrived at Bushire, and we have f 1 iw QPPTi that any result has been obtained by you : so far as we can see not so far eX p r esses yourself according to the wishes and up to Y p M / in the opening of the Shief route, secondly, in repair- fnTth and! the Mashileh Mute ^ ^ sived on 20 ^ ^ ^ * IMDIA FOREIGN S-ORK ARY’S I -ter. tie. 31 ■We must have a clear proof that you still continue to entertain the same opinion which you expressed in Borasjun in the residence of Agha Shaikh Jafar and Agha Shaikh Muhammad Husain. We will also tell you plainly that you should know that so long as these four conditions are not fulfilled, (1) (the restoration of) the German prisoners, (2) the total withdrawal of British troops from Bushire, (3) the return of the 4 N prisoners taken from Bushire and those wounded in the fighting and (4 ?) the establishment of Gendarmerie at Bushire, it will be impossible that the hosti lity between us and the British be removed, even if a single one of these condi tions remain unsettled. Further, Your Excellency should not think that you will be able to succeed in maintaining yourself in Bushire. You yourself know us well that we are not afraid whether we are killed or ruined, or whether we live; and that the Governor of Bushire cannot achieve any success in his objects without having us (as his friends). You cannot achieve any success by simply bring ing a few men from Angali. How can you silence ten thousand men, whose sons and fathers have been killed, by acting in accordance with the wish and desire of the British ? On the day you left for Bushire, you told us “ If I do not settle affairs in seven days, I will not prevent any steps you take”. It now appears that since the day you left up to now, you have been earnestly trying to open the Shief route. You have taken Angali tufangcbis to Bushire. The Gendarmes, who are Government servants, must sleep out in the cold on the desert, while you take others, who are acting against the Nation and in favour of our enemies into Bushire. We will hold our hands to the 24)th (3rd November). If the situation continues as it is, we will take such steps as we can. You state that affairs will be put right and terminated when th e telegraph line is put right. This excuse from Your Excellency cannot be listened to, because every day you are communicating 20 telegrams to the Government from Borasjun. We kno*v the English better; if they say that they are not wearied out by our hostility, they are lyino\ By the will of God, we will bring such pressure to bear upon them by ni^ht that it will be read of in history. We will either let all the people of Dashti, Tangistan and Chahkutah be killed, or else remove their mischief from the Ports. It was necessary for us to represent this to Your Excellency so that you may know. More than this would be boldness. Wh expect to receive your instructions and intentions. May the days of glory and prosperity endure.61 v. 1915 Telegram P., No. D.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. The British and Eussian Ministers had an audience of the Shah this afternoon at which a general understanding was reached for cordial and inti mate relations between the three Powers based on a policy of benevolent neutrality on the part of Persia towards her two neighbours. The Cabinet is to be strengthened by the inclusion of two Persian Statesmen Prince Ain- ed-Dowleh aud Prince Parman Parma who are known to favour the streng thening of the friendly relations between the three Powers. Tehran is perfectly quiet and very pleased with the news. His Imperial Majesty the Shah is at the Palace and the report that he has left or intends to leave the Capital is without foundation. 64 Telegram P., No. 457-F., dated the 15th (received 16th) November 1915. From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. Great alarm has been caused here by arrival of Eussian troops at Karej, twenty miles from Tehran, and advance of a few outposts beyond that point. Shah made preparations to depart to Kum from the capital. Eussian Minister and I were invited to Palace where Prime Minister, President of the Council and other (s) Minister (s) (were ?). We came (to) following agreement : — Troops will not advance beyond Karej and Cabinet will meanwhile be strengthened by inclusion Parman Parma and Ain-ed-Dowleh whose presence and responsibility will be a guarantee to us of a policy of benevolent neutrality towards the two Powers. As soon (as) our conversation has begun (with) new Cabinet for the pur pose (of) agreeing as to measures required for giving practical effect to this policy troops will be withdrawn from Karej to Yengi Imam, viz., about half way (to) Kasvin and eventually to Kasvin. I earnestly (trust ?) that this arrange ment will meet with approval. - '/ 0 .Jl O ii I_j) 9 f~. fl w i •O' 1 * i INDIA FORKIGil SECRETAfiY’S IcttOP. No. 31 M2 There is nothing to report to-day. It is quite certain that Shah will leave if troops are not removed further from Capital. We then saw Shah. We explained to him programme and assured him we would exert all our efforts to obtain assent of our Govern ments thereto. His Majesty was very agitated but we left him with his promise that until we received a reply he would not leave Capital. He gave us assurances of (j intimate and cordial relations in future. As he may still change his mind if troops remain long at Karej I hope reply may be sent without delay. 65 Telegram P v No. 459-F., dated (and received) the 16th November 1915. From-—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. Clear the line. My telegram No. 457. Yesterday three enemy missions left Tehran, Germans being first to go. Their departure shows how diffident they are of their hold in Persia. Advance of Russian troops on the other hand has terrified Shah and a mere rumour they are coming nearer might cause Shah to follow Germans. It is of prime importance therefore that Russian Minister and I should be allowed control for next fortnight or so over movement of troops towards or from Tehran. Por the moment the danger point is an inexperi enced and nervous youth who requires constant management. As for Government as distinct from Shah it seems as if Germans boast that a Turco-German (force ?) will appear in Persia has made considerable impression upon them. I do not know what importance should be attached to this, boast, but Germans and Turks might succeed in getting together on frontier some force of tribesmen with a few regulars, and I think it would he useful if we were authorised to assure Persian Government that in order to repel any aggression in that quarter two powers would give their support to Persia. A defensive alliance would possibly be best solution : it would be commit tal of Persia to us and would regularise use in Persia of Russian troops. It is impossible to predict what effect in Provinces events of yesterday will have. German Agents working there are far more resolved and reckless than was German Legation (has proved ?) and they will very likely (now try to ?) raise revolution in the country. If, on the other hand, in the next few days we can definitely commit Per sian Government to our side I think it is probable majority of their partisans will abandon Germans.

Yesterday Russian Minister and I were invited to Palace for consultation as to formation of Cabinet. The attitude of Ain-ed-Dowleh was most umsatis- factory partly from jealousy of Farman Farina and partly from fear responsibility and he refused to accept any ministerial post m the Cabinet. Farman Farma was selected eventually as Minister of the Interior and Ain- ed-Dowleh entered Cabinet without portfolio. Other Ministers and President of the Council remain as they were.4 There is nothing to report to-day. Farman Farma is now acting with great vigour. He feels fairly confident that with our unstinted support and so long as we can keep Shah in Tehran and troops at Ka,rej he can save situation. I hope it will not be impossible to reconcile His Majesty to their presence there for with their departure situation would collapse. Swedish Officer Commanding Gendarmerie has flatly refused to obey orders from Minister of the Interior. He has endeavoured to persuade Shah to leave. We are trying to obtain his dismissal from the post. Sent to India, Petrograd; addressed to Foreign Office. 74 Telegram P., No. 464-F., dated the 17th (received 18th) November 1915.

Please see your telegram No. 393. Any difficulty of giving arms and men is, I venture to suggest, insignificant as com pared with prospect of seeing Goltz or others in Persia raising a force against us to attack our communication with Baghdad. Of military situation in Turkey I have no knowledge but I cannot help suggesting that if Turks can not defend Baghdad adequately it is unlikely, even with assistance of Persia and tribesmen, they could make on Persia any very serious attack or one which Russian troops that Grand Duke is ready to send could not deal with assisted by presence of our own forces at Baghdad.

Shah received to-day the Russian Minister and was much less insistent on withdrawal from Karej of troops. It would be most expeditious nevertheless in order to appease public opinion and to (re-assure ?) Shah that a commencement of withdrawal should be made. A moderate detachment should, however, remain since Germans, Mujahidin, Austrians, etc., would return, if troops were withdrawn completely before Farman Farma has situation in hand and we should revert to situation that prevailed before their arrival in the vicinity.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Sistan, Rohat, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. It seems from various telegraph departmental communications which I have seen that Director of Persian Section, Tehran, Superintendent, Kerman, anticipate Central Persian line may be permanently put out of use at any moment. If so, all the State traffic from Tehran will have to come through Robat, Sistan and Meshed. There is only one Indian telegraph clerk at Robat. At Sistan the two English clerks are not paid by Telegraph Department but by this Consulate for which in addition to telegraphing they have always been doing all my clerical confidential work. When Robat-Sistan line was constructed I practically lost altogether services of one clerk. If Central Persian line breaks down I shall lose entire services of both clerks and without assistance they will be unable to cope with the work for many days. Similarly there appears urgent need for reinforcing Robat. I understand that Persian section is under-manned. It seems desirable if Indo-European Telegraph Department clerks cannot be sent from Karachi that military signallers or Indians should be sent to both Robat and Sistan. As the Persian Government presumably will maintain their title to day hours, most of working hours will probably be at night. As there is only one clerk at Meshed now it appears that staff there should also be increased. 87 Telegram P., No. 296-C., dated (and received) the 19th November 1915.

I enquired from the Director, Persian Section, through His Majesty s Minister at Tehran if Mr. Dormer’s services could be spared. A reply has been received from the Director to the effect that, provided no relief is asked for and that Lovell or Medcalf is permitted to take over Inspectorship of seventh sub-section, he has no objection. To Medcalf resuming charge in addition to duties in Sistan I have no objection and I would like to gratify wishes of Mr, Dormer and the OfficerCommanding, but on the understanding that Mr. Medcalf is not required to tour along the telegraph line until the telegraph staff at Sistan is reinforced by at least two more men if possible. In this connection please refer to my telegram No. 295-C. of to-day. The Army Department |would not I presume in the special circumstances of the case require Mr. Dormer to undergo one month’s training in India with British Regiment.

From—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi, To—The Deputy Director General, Telegraphs, Traffic, Calcutta. Central Persian telegraph line is apparently interrupted and is likely to remain so for some time.

Six points mentioned in my telegram No. 442 will also be brought forward for later discussion and possibly , the y entirely possession of Holy places in Mesopotamia, administration being left . y in our hands.By a friend in whom I can place implicit reliance I am assured that no outrageous demand will be made. Germans are making most lavish promises of arms (and ?) officers to form an army and cash amounting to three million pounds. Russian Minister and I have intimated our readiness to enter into conversa tions so as to be able to submit to our Governments definite proposals.

Any attempt to put pressure on them would make situation here which is difficult, worse than it is now. Turkish Ambassador is at Shah Abdul Azim, German Minister is at Kum Austrian Minister is at Kerizek. An attempt to seize any of them by means of Russian troops would be signal for Shah’s departure.

From—The Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment. My last telegram. It appears from a letter from O’Connor that about 9 am. November 10th an anonymous self-constituted “National Committee for the protection of Independence of Persia ” delivered to O’Connor ultimatum giving him thirty minutes to submit to the “ Provisional arrest of himself and the British Colony and their despatch to Borasjun to be there detained for exchange with German and Persian prisoners taken on Persian neutral territory by his compatriots. As for women they can, if they wish remain in perfect security at Shiraz or accompany you to Barasjun whence they will be sent under escort to Bushire immediately.” Failing acceptance with in thirty minutes houses of British would be bombarded. Assistant Superintendent Smith would be held liable personally if the telegraph installation was not handed over intact. After arrival of British Colony in Borasjun as stated the men were handed over to Tangistani Khans and in whose charge the prisoners are is not quite clear. Mrs. Ferguson says Sheikh Husain but I have not received any letter from him or anyone else. In his letter O’Connor states that following are Khan’s conditions for the release of prisoners :— I. Return of all German and Persian prisoners taken on Persian soil with their belongings. II. Repayment of certain sums attached during occupation belonging to Ghazanfar and Sheikh Husain. Ill, Evacuation of Bushire, that is, the withdrawal of our troops from there. As regards No. II subject was referred to in my telegram No. 482-C., Ghazanfar’s money is intact here; about one quarter of Sheikh Husain’s money was used to reimburse out-of-pocket loss caused to British subjects by raids which his son led. The balance is here still. As it does not appear in the ultimatum this condition has been apparently interpolated by the Khans. I presume that these terms will be quite unacceptable. Mrs. Furguson states, that to intensify the force of ultimatum Husain sent a message by her demanding a reply by Wednesday, November 24th, or “ he would declare war on10 us.” I propose to write to O’Connor informing him that matter has been reported to Government and that I am requesting that whoever considers himself in charge of prisoners should be told to communicate with me and make it clear’feat by what right he claims to speak for the “ National Com mittee.” Eepeated to Foreign, Sir P.

Darya Begi says telegrams to Kawam Soulet and Khans would carry more weight if they were signed by Ain-ud-Daula instead of or in addition to Pirman Pirma. Possibly Shah himself mio&gt;ht be induced to send some telegrams. ° The “ National Committee ” referred to in my telegram No. 710-C appears to be composed of Persian officers of gendarmerie assisted by German Consul. J . I venture to suggest for consideration, since the whole business was engineered by gendarmerie, whether it would not be advisable that His Imperial Majesty the Shah should issue Kescripts ordering return to Shiraz of prisoners and their reinstatement with all honour in their original places or their surren- der to us here, failing which Pars regiment of gendarmerie would be disbanded' forthwith. ^ This would not, I imagine, induce gendarmerie to hand over prison ers, or affect their own prospect much as anyhow they will not o&gt; e t much pay. But I think it might make an impression on the people° who are inclined to be friendly or really neutral as it would deprive gendarmerie of eir official status and show clearly that by Persian Government their actions are disavowed and generally discredit them.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi, At present moment both Persian Government and Shah are genuinely alarmed at situation to which their German intrigues have brought country and^ they feel that Persia must adopt an attitude which is more definite neu trality, even the benevolent neutrality they profess themselves ready to practise, will always leave the door open to complaints from one party or other and they wor^hl like to put end to all ambiguity and to declare that Persia commits?hecs'elljto one side or other definitely, Government and Shah prefer to go to country? and if questions of alliance were raised I think that they would vote for en tent4 Of course, for their alliance they would demand more than six points reported in my telegram No. 442 and first of all they will require assurances of protection against Turkish aggression. His Majesty’s Government are of course much better able than myself to gauge consequences to ourselves if Persia entered into war against us, but I feel that they far outweigh any disadvantages, present op future, attendant on conclusion of a Persian alliance. If Persia willingly or otherwise joins Germany, German aims of immobiliz ing force in India that are required elsewhere, of making insecure our military position in Mesopotamia and of stirring trouble in Caucasus may well be realized. If Persia, on the other hand, becomes our ally German plans here fail assuredly. In the event of Persia joining them they are promising Persia that in two or three months a Turco-German army corps will be sent from Constantinople. I do not suppose that they ever intend to do more than send a small force as nucleus of an army for use against us in Mesopotamia and Afghanistan, recruited, formed and organized under German and Turkish officers. This scheme would be certainly abandoned if no response could be expected in this country. Moreover, propaganda here would soon collapse with Persian Government openly hostile to Germans; they would keep certain number of small tribes with them, but all the greater ones would stand by Persian Government. Prom military point of view our responsibilities would therefore not be great. Persian demands as price of her alliance may be grouped under two heads—financial and political. She will want money^ in some form but certainly nothing at all commensurate with cost of prolongation of war for single week. As to political demands they may be comprised under six points above mentioned or others might be added. Whatever they are they will certainly be aimed at freeing Persia from the hold two Powers Lave in vaiious irec- tions over her. Apart from purely geographical conditions our hold has mainly been established in recent past through Persia’s financial dependence on two Powers and such is chaos reigning here it may be safely assumed that it all Persia’s debt were extinguished to-morrow and large sum given to her to start afresh with her financial embarrassments will in very few years again reduce her to depend on us so that to re-establish our present hold we shall again have requisite lever in our hands.12 Balance of advantage in favour of alliance seems to me therefore to be enormous on our side and I venture to urge that great concessions can be made to Persia to secure her alliance. I suggest Bussian Minister and I be authorised to open negotiations at once for this purpose while Persian Government is well disposed. If Persian Government demands are too exorbitant, negotiations can be dropped; we at all events gain time meanwhile, I hear first rate authority that inducements which Germans are holding out to Persia are being daily increased and they produce certain effect on credulous Persian mind impossible of realization as they are. Sent to India, Petrograd ; addressed Poreign Office. 108 No. 2S0-C., dated Sistan, the 4th November 1915. From —Major F. B. Prideaux, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain, To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a report No. 152, dated the 17th October 1915, submitted by Mr. R H. New, His Majesty’s Vice- Consul at Birjand, regarding his tour in the north-east border division of the Kainat district after the visit of the German Paschen from Herat. 2. I had desired Mr. New to make a more extensive tour down the boun dary to Duroh and other villages as it appeared improbable that he would ever again have so favourable an opportunity for touring this winter after my own departure from Birjand, but the suggestion was found impracticable for ihe reasons given by the Vice-Consul. 3. Mr. New Las acquired some useful information, but I am not entirely prepared to accept all the inferences which he puts forward. I submit the following observations of my own— (a) Ali Akbar Beg is undoubtedly a rogue wliose sentiments in the main are hostile to us on account of the pressure we put upon the late Hisam-ud-Howleh and his son Hashmat-ul-Mulk to pay compensation for the Neh raid. His claim to be Shaukat-ul- Mulk s servant has been denied by the latter, but in my opinion be would not dare now-a-days to act in any serious matter con trary to the present Governor’s views. It is a fact that he had sent me two belated and stale news reports before Mr. New went out; this was done probably out of fear that our troops would pay him a special visit. I have promised him a good reward if he betrays any Germans into our hands, but I have little hope of any valuable result. (b) The story about the Mirza’s two telegrams is scarcely worthy of credence. I think I should certainly have heard if they had ever reached the N eh, Birjand or Rain telegraph offices, and it is not apparent why Ali Akbar Beg did not himself undertake to get +w e !i Sent awa y- tlle telegrams really were written I presume an, '^t they must have held some hidden meaning. (&lt;?) The story about Asghar Zadeh leaving Herat for Meshed has been corroborated m Meshed Confidential Diary No. 4 L for the week en mg t e 9th October 1915, but it has not been ascertained that eVer - succeeded in passing through Khurasan. {d) I am not inclined to accept the view that the villagers of Sunni Khana are well disposed towards the Germans and Turks because ey are mostly on bad terms with the Governor’s family. I believe that since the late Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s death these Sunnis lave no bpem badly treated, and they have little desire to be annexed to Afghanistan from which country they are not infre quently harassed by raiders even now-a-days.(e) It seems probable that the earlier stories which reached me about Afghan Agents buying up stocks of supplies in Sunni Khana villages were incorrect not as regards the visits but as regards the results. The Sunnis of the Julga (valley) do not wish to see any Afghan force marching through their district mainly because it was so badly devastated by locusts last June. (/) The report which reached Mr. New that the Governor had issued instructions for the arrest of Germans and other strangers was incorrect. I particularly asked His Excellency if it was true, and he has denied it saying that he had only impressed upon his subordinates the necessity for prompt reports of such persons’ movements. 4. Mr. New has all this summer held an opinion about the Governor’s sincerity and friendliness towards our Government more assured than my own, and I must admit that His Excellency’s personal relations with all the English in Birjand have been as pleasant of late as they were in the preceding years. I am, however, more and more becoming converted to the view that his poli tical sympathies are really with the Germans. In the first place he detests oar Allies the Russians, both on general and on personal grounds, and in the second his most intimate associates, the two chief military officers and the ex-Director of Revenues, are undoubtedly pro-German. The soldiers openly express their admiration for Germany, but the Einance officer Seyid Mohsin who never discussed them in my presence, has probably done the greatest mischief. He was doubtless sent to Birjand in the Autumn of 1914 for the very purpose of alienating the Governor from our side. It is rather a significant fact that when His Excellency was informed of the British victory at Kut-al-Amarah he refrained from expressing a single word of congratulation. He is not in my opinion benevolently neutral towards us now, but I think that he considers himself still to be strictly and literally neutral. If put to any serious test I believe that he will show his benevolence to the other side. Enclo. to Serial No. 106. No. 152, dated Birjand, the 17th October 1915. From— R. H New, Esq., His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Brijand, To Major F. B. Prideaux, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain. I have the honour to report that under your instructions I left Birjand on the 21st September on tour in the Julgi-i-Sunni Khaneh and Zir Kuh districts, to visit various villages through which the German party and Herr Paschen passed, and ascertain the general impression they created in these districts. . 0 _ . . . „ . 2. I was accompanied by 10 of your escort and 8 Persian and Afghan levies. I also took my Mirza, Seyid Ghulam Reza and one Ghulam of the Vice-Consulate. ^ , . . 3. Halts were made at the following places visited on the dates noted 21st September Aliabad 16 miles. 22nd 22nd 23rd 23rd 24th 24th 25th 26th 26th 27th 27th 28th 29th 29th 80th 1st October n Isfizar Naozad Dareh-i-Charm Takhtiban Pish Bar .

At Naozad on the 24th September I heard that a force of more than 400 Afghans had collected at Yazdan (in Persian territory) three days previously, but enquiry proved the report to be entirely false. Here, unfortunately, two of our horses broke down and I had to send back one of them to Eirjand with a Persian levy. There is a difficult hill to negotiate before reaching Naozad with a very steep descent. 5. At Takhtiban I met Ali Akbar Beg, who, according to report, had done a good deal, to help the Germans. He is intelligent and cunning and was until two years ago, Hissam-ud-Dowleh’s Tahvildar in Sistan. Now he claims to be a servant of Shoukat-ul-Mulk. He has a good house at Takhtiban which is a large village of some 1,500 inhabitants, and he appeared to have a good supply of grain, for he supplied my requirements and said I would have found difficulty in procuring grain elsewhere in the village. 6. I accused Ali Akbar Beg of having helped the German party which passed through the village in July and Herr Paschen. He was perfectly frank and said he had made it his business to appear friendly to them in order to get at their secrets and intentions for the information of his master Shoukat-ul-Mulk. He boasted of having some days previously sent you a report, through Jawala Singh, of Paschen’s movements, and asked me to pay for the Kossid who parried the report to Birjand. He did all he could for my party, and placed his house at my disposal. My impression is that Ali Akbar Beg did rather more for the Germans than was necessary, but that his motive was simply mercenary. I think he is a rogue who would give Paschen or any one else away to the highest bidder and willingly serve two or more masters. 7. Ali Akbar was quite open about Paschen’s doings and he gave me a complete account of his return from Afghanistan, with despatches, which is as follows : — Paschen reached Takhtiban from Herat on the 20th Shaval by the Gozukht route, the shortest from Yazdan but very difficult for horses and mules. He left for Duruksh next day. On reaching Naoghab Chiek 3 farsakhs from Sehdeh, he learned that the road was held by Indian and Cossack patrols. He remained at Naoghab Chiek for two nights lookino- for an opportunity to get through, and on the third day returned to Jarf, a small Kalata near Takhtibam Here Paschen sent for All Akbar and discussed the prospects of netting through to Tabas, suggesting he could disguise himself as a shepherd or a camejman. Paschen was greatly agitated. He said he had no care for his lire but could not afford to lose the despatches he carried, a big parcel from which he showed Ah Akbar two telegrams, which he said were given to him by their Persian Mirza, a Tehrani, named Mirza Husein Khan, for despatch from Kam. These telegrams were (1) To German Minister, Tehran, asking that his (the Muza s) things might be sent with 50 Gandermes to Biriand^ a , r( f (2 AA 0 £ er T an Co 1 ns ? 1, Is P ahan &gt; asking for Ts. 2,500. Ali Akbar further states that Paschea told him the Persian officer of their sowars Askar Zadeh, had also left Herat with despatches for Ispahan travelling via Meshed. i - advlsed : Paschea Dot ^ attempt the journey to Tabas, and the latter left the same night for Herat, again travelling by the Gozukht road. 8. The German party seems to have been well received at Takhtiban, where, besides Ah Akbar Beg, a person named Mirza Muhammad Khan gave them considerable assistance in procuring supplies. They camped on an open space of ground near water; on the outskirts of the village. ^ I gathered that many Sunnis in the Julgi district who are mostly on bad rPmV, 1 t p, 1 S T ni “S famil y of E - aiDat - w ere well disposed towaids the “T* and il ' rks accompanyrng them, but the party do not appear to have crea t'd any real impression even in Takhtiban, as they were regarded as fugitives. They paid liberally for supplies and guides. ... -fh Gozakht they are spoken badly of as they threatened the people and hrfbLn told amba, ' S “ search of grain, which they seem to have been told at lakhliban was procurable at Gosukht. DI understand, Niedenlmeyer, who was head of the party spoke Persian fluently, hut Paschen knew only a little Persian. Paschen, I gathered, is tall and heavily built, with fair hair and green eyes and wears a longish fair beard. His dress was of Khaki, with tunic, and he wore a forage cap, with a gold band and badge in front. ^ r b 9. Ali Akbar asked me for employment and claimed to have done much work for the boundary commission in years past. I told him he had success fully hidden Paschen’s movements until he had got safely away; that we would not employ anyone desirous of serving both sides, but if he would prove his^ worth by giving us timely information of any other German Emissaries, which might lead to a capture, he could expect a very liberal present from us. 10. At Takhtiban I heard that the Deputy Governor of the Zir Kuh district, Naib Ali Beg, who was sent to Zir Kuh from Birjand by Shoukat-ul- Mulk some 20 days previously was of Aviz. I was inclined to be suspicious of this individual’s doings and decided to proceed to Aviz and meet him. At Bashiran, 2 farsakhs from Aviz, I learned the Naib had gone to Muhamadabad. I met him there and found that his tour in the Zir Kuh district was quite innocent and that he had, on the contrary, received instructions from Shoukat- ul-Mulk to arrest any Germans or other strangers. The truth of this seemed to be borne out by the fact that soon after I reached Muhamadabad a sowar from iWiz arrived there with a report for the Naib that 57 strange sowars had reached Bashiran the previous day. It was my party. 11. I had heard a report that Naib Ali Beg had been collecting grain at Aviz. He confirmed it and explained that a party of Cossacks had lately visited Aviz, and as the people there had been put to some trouble in supply ing them with grain, he had laid in a stock from outlying villages in order to be able to cope with the requirements of any other party of Cossacks going there. Naib Ali Beg had no news except that he had been ordered by Shoukat- ul-Mulk to visit Shahrakhs and Yazdan. He asked me to petition Shoukat-ul- Mulk to allow him to return to Birjand. I hear the Naib had in 20 days managed to collect for himself 600 tomans from Zir Kuh villages. 12. Erom Muhamadabad I intended visiting Malaki and Gozukht, and touring the Eastern side of the Ahangaian hills to Awaz, but unfortunately the condition of my horses and mules, which had had a very trying time over much slony ground through difficult hills, would not permit it, and after visit ing Ahangaran, I cut through the hills by way of Gumeh to Gulmeran, a place through which the German party and Paschen passed. There is no village at Gulmeran and fodder had to be sent on ahead from Muhamadabad. I heard here that very little fodder was obtainable at Gozukht and that the Germans had threatened the people there and broken open several ambars in search of grain. 13. Thence I moved to Awaz via Gazik. Here there was a report that a German (possibly Paschen) had passed Sabzwar (in Afghanistan) a few days previously, travelling south. There was also inforn ation of another party of 8 Germans who were said to have got through to Herat from Kerman by a route near Neh into Afghanistan. Both these reports were vague and I could not get at their source. 11. I would have proceeded to Duroh, 60 miles south of Awaz, to try and gather some confirmation of the above reports, but even after a day’s halt at Awaz, the condition of my animals was so poor, many of the horses and mules having cast shoes which could not be renewed, that I was compelled to return to Birjand by way of Eurg and Bushkaz. 15. The people of Awaz spoke very highly of Ptahmat Ali. He seems to have carried out his duties with tact and made himself popular there. The scheme of intelligence which he controls, of 6 mounted sowars and 6 footmen, is eminently practical and well organized.16. Throughout the Julgi Sunni Khaneh and Zir Kuh districts the scarcity of grain owing to the visitation of locusts in the Spring before the crops were' fathered, is more penetrating than I imagined, and enormous damage to the crops was done. Thousands of the poorer cultivators have migrated to Khaf and Meshed in consequence. And even at big villages like Takhtiban and Awaz there was great scarcity. At the latter place the only |\ bread obtainable was that of barley flour. 17. I made careful enquiries as to whether grain had been stored at any places in these districts by the Germans or their agents, for we had heard reports to this effect, but I do not think it can he correct, and, indeed, the scarcity is so acute, that I do not think it would now he feasible to gather sufficient grain for a party with 100 animals. On the route followed by the German party from Takhtiban, through Gulmiran, Gozukht, JMalaki, Yazdan, to Sangat in Afghanistan, a distance of about 100 miles, practically no grain is now procurable. 18. Dafedar Muhammad Khan, who was in charge of my Escort, was most helpful. He obtained his supplies en route often at very moderate prices, without any friction, and the entire party behaved very well. The Dafedar also did his utmost to nurse the horses by dismounting his men at bad places in the hills. 19. I made notes of all routes traversed which I hope to submit in the course of a few days. 9Draft Paper.

Orders had also been sent to me to destroy Cypher Code c ‘ P In event of a similar crisis recurring and developing unfavourably the Officer Commanding column and I have no clear orders as to what we should do. The Baluch Sardars of Sistan are, I believe, inimical to the present Governor Shaukat-ul-Mulk and thoroughly disloyal to the Persian Government. If they were assured that they would not be punished at the termination of the war or if we announced our intention of annexing the province they will side with us. Though really preferring British rule to that of either Afghanistan or Persia they would desert us if Afghanistan also entered the war on the side of our enemies. If Baluch Sardars join us and Afghanistan remains neutral our position here would be secure until Germans and Turks arrive in force, but if jehad is taken up at once by the Afghans we should, I think, have to make as quickly as possible for British territory hardly waiting for the contingent at Birjand who perhaps would do better to go to Meshed and join the Bussians.

In Russian Minister’s audience no mention of troops was made. Minister for Foreign Affairs called on us by appointment at five. He stayed till eight and' begged us to cause troops to be removed hinting thst if they were not Cabinet might resign or take its departure from Tehran. He represented appearance of troops so near the capital would make it impossible for Government to pursue policy (of ?) neutrality they were now hoping to be able to adopt as it would rouse great excitement against two Powers. Me said it lay not with us but with Russian Government to arrest the movement of troops. Government had our assurance that troops came only for protection of colonies and legations and that it was duty of Cabinet to explain this to people and make it clear that there was no hostile intention in the movement of troops towards capital. His Excel- lencv pressed us to say what we desired Government to do to obtain return of troops to Kasvin. We replied that essential thing was to remove large number of Germans, Austrians and Turks and seize arms, etc., which German legation possessed. He promised Germans, Austrians etc , should be removed to a safe distance from Tehran and kept under guard and that Government8 would try to obtain possession of arms. He added that our safety would be absolutely guaranteed by Swedish Government. Russian Minister promised to report, what Minister for Foreign Affairs had said to Petrograd.

I then pressed Minister for Foreign Affairs to tell us terms on which Persian Government were willing to adopt benevolent neutrality towards the two Powers. After dilating on necessity (for) conciliating public opinion His Excellency produced them as follows :— (1) Settlement of purely Russian question that is strict observance of Treaty (of) Turcomanshai and collection of revenue(s) by Russian Consuls. (2) Request for arms, etc., to form Persian Army. (3) Revision of tariff. (4) If other neutral countries are allow T ed to send delegates, Persia to be represented at peace conference. (5) Undertaking (to) withdraw Russian troops from all parts of Persia to be discussed at a later date in a friendly spirit. (6) Cancellation of recognition by Persia of 1907 Convention as well (as) of other undertakings obtained by ultimatum in 1911. I said consideration of public opinion could hardly have inspired inser tion points (3) and (4). During the six months I had been in Persia neither point had been even mentioned by Minister or in press and as for number 4 it looked as if it was of German origin. I feared that in London list would not make a favourable impression. Russian Minister concurred. He said as regards (1) that although he had repeatedly expressed his readiness to discuss these points, and he was equally prepared to do so still, Persian Government four months ago had not cared to discuss questions involved. As to (5) conversations had taken place between Persian Government and his predecessor and could be renewed. We agreed to inform our Governments of Persian Government’s proposals and recommend sympathetic consideration. (?)

Minis ter of Education called last night about 9-30 and stayed till 1-20 a.m. He said he had been sent by Cabinet to obtain answers on two points (a) on what terms we would withdraw troops to Kasvin and (6) on what terms were we prepared to negotiate for Persia’s benevolent neutrality on terms communi cated by Minister for Foreign Affairs to us. There was, I said, little to add as regards («) to what Russian Minister and I had already told Minister for Foreign Affairs, that is that it did not lie (? with) us. It seemed to me as if hint thrown out by Minister for Foreign Affairs about Government retiring to Ispahan was nothing but a threat ( ? that) if we did not agree to Persia’s requirements in return for her bene volent neutrality, Persia would throw in her lot with Germany. I was not much impressed by threat as I was convinced Shah would not care to take left seat in Prince Reuss carriage and I knew Cabinet did not wish to see Persia involved in war which could only have results for her which would be disastrous. If in its professions ?) towards us Government was sincere it should have the courage to declare its policy openly and let the world know that it frankly accepted our assurances (that) the troops had been moved merely to insure safety of Legation, etc , and had no purpose of an unfriendly kind. We had by according moratorium already given proof of our friendliness and we must have some corresponding sign from Persia. His Excellency said that the approach of troops might have disastrous effects in provinces. I retort (ed ?) that position of our Consuls could hardly be worse than it is if there is any objection to entirely passive attitude of Government and gendarmerie’s open hostility. As to (5) whole thing looked like blackmail but we were now in a position of defence ? ? I replied ? ? and to ask us to abandon that advantage was ridiculous. If troops now withdrew to Kasvin I should pro bably be in same plight myself as Consul, Shiraz, who has not been able to leave his garden for two months. That position I declined to accept. Nearer troops came the better I should be pleased. As to substance of Persian proposals the more I thought of them the less I understood spirit in which they had been framed. To accept them in principle as he suggested sounded well but any acceptance at all as regards two of them was fully impossible (?) I would communicate them to you and report your reply to Persian Government. It was significant that Minister said little or nothing about departure to Ispahan and so long as we stand fast and allow troops to move nearer situation may be saved. If we show weakness it certainly will be lost. - In German Legation there is great _ activity large quantities of flour furniture, etc., are being packed some being (?) sent to American Legation during the night.

This morning Russian Minister and I met Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs by appointment. Ministers dilated at great length on necessity for conciliating public opinion and upon recall of troops to Kasvin. They said, that as soon as that was done, and two Governments had agreed to discuss terms on which Persia would adopt benevolent neutrality, Persian Government would declare their determination to put an end to German intrigues, etc., publicly. We said that movement of troops was not under our control and that situation here in any case did not warrant their withdrawal. Persian Government had promised to remove Austrian prisoners and take other mea sures but had done absolutely nothing but provide few guards armed with unserviceable rifles for defence of Legation. Orders to troops could not be modified in these circumstances. Meanwhile as to proposed negotiations we might expect instructions from our Governments. By accepting moratorium Persian Government had practically pledged themselves to benevolent neutra lity and had no cause whatever to regard presence of troops as unfriendly. If Government was sincere in their professions they would at once make this clear to public and our Governments. Minister said that they could not take such a step in face of public opinion. We parted wnth an understanding that so long as Mujahidin are not dis armed troops would not move back. Persian Government say that until after 10th Moharrem, November 18th, this cannot be safely done. 80 mules left town last night it is believed for Hamadan and I can in form that all German officers here did the same.It would seem certain mules were utilized to carry to Hamadanarms, etc., mentioned in my immediately preceding telegram and if this is so Govern ment had already connived at this move. German Minister has left his Legation and lives in house adjoining United States Legation. To-day attitude of Minister was entirely unsatisfactory and (?) I think troops should without delay move nearer to Tehran. Sent to India, Petrograd, addressed to Poreign Office. 36 Telegram P., No. 34-D.

(Addressed Foreign Office, London, repeated to Petrograd, Basrah and Bushire.) With reference to my immediately preceding telegram, I have heard from Minister for Eoreign Affairs who denies all knowledge of any such occur rences at Shiraz. The story it is just possible is a German invention made up with the object of influencing events at the capital. A story of very much the same kind was circulated here regarding Hamadan which proved entirely without foundation. The Minister for Eoreign Affairs talked in the most friendly way and asked whether Russian Minister and I mistrusted the present Cabinet. If we did so a Cabinet could easily be formed that would enjoy our confidence. The Shah, he declar ed, had no intention of leaving the capital. The Persian Government seems to be on the point of coming over to us. The German Agents are still moving from Tehran and their flight has naturally shaken the belief in them, There is also an exodus of their adherents. 41 Telegram P., No. R.-339, dated the 12th (received 13th) November 1915, From— The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Knt, through Basrah, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. i ... The great importance of preventing as long as possible the news from becoming public in the event of a rupture with Persia, is again urged by the Consul, Mohammerah,—-in order to give the Sheikh time to assemble the heads of tribes.

Please see your telegram 284-C. An informer of mine who has had confidential talk with Daood Ali and another Indian who is addressed by them as Professor, reports having decided against trying to get through in small parties (of) six ; they mean to make the next attempt in force : that Jehind has promised them assistance: the route through T)eh Salm is that selected: and Zugmeyer will join them from here. This person was some time among the Baluchis. It appears from the reports from Yezd that all the Germans are collected there. My opinion is that they will come on by Zarand Pass north of here either to Khabis or a point near it where they trust to meet the Baluchis: while Zugmeyer with 100 to 150 Persians will probably join on as they pass. _ Special sowars have been posted by me at the road due north of here and I will try to send you information of exact route taken as early as possible. Further an arrangement has been made by me for an attack on Jehind’s home by his enemies in the customary course and I thought that you might perhaps to able to take similar action in the north in order to draw him back to his own country. 45 Telegram P., dated the 12th (received 13th) November 1915.

Ten days ago at my request Sardar Khudad-ad Khan sent one hundred and fifty camels to Nushki but he was cautioned against doing this and threatened by both Deputy Governor and late Kevenue Director. Several other Baluch notables have offered to supply me with sowars and riflemen to oppose Germans. ^ They do not at present take Germans seriously but news is beginning to filter in about Jehind joining eimans large number of Bakhtiaris on Germans side. Consequently Sistan Sardars may begin to think official policy (of) neutrality more politic and unless we have14 previously bound them whole heartedly by liberal treatment to our side if their country eventually is dragged into war they will have to follow. May I commence entertaining sowars and riflemen up to two hundred from tribes which I consider most trustworthy and inform their Sardars at once that British Government will safeguard them and levies whom they supply to us from Persian Government’s anger ? As latter are permitting Germans freely to entertain Persians against us it does not seem that Persian Government can object though local authorities may do so.

Shah received Russian Minister and me in audience to-day and conver sation lasted more than two hours. After explaining to Shah that presence of troops denoted no hostile intention towards Persia but quite contrary we urged that modification of Cabinet should be made such as would satisfy our Governments that Persia meant to carry out engagement to put an end to enemy intrigue implied by acceptance from us of financial support and that a declaration should be published of Government’s new policy of benevolent declaration towards us. His Majesty would agree only to nomination of a Minister of the Interior whose presence in the Cabinet would inspire two Governments with confidence but this only provided troops first returned to Kasvin. We told His Majesty that this was impossible and we were unable to move him from that position although we gave him to understand in unmistakeable^ language that if Persian Government did not act against Germans, Russian troops would undertake that task and that if Persia allowed herself to be driven into war against us results to Persia and to himself would be disastrous.

Situation at Suj-lulak and Mara^n. Disturbances are assnrainn widespread proportions at Buj-Bulak. The Governor of Has informed the population of L:i&amp;nlah t that he ices not dispose of a sufficiently strong force to oppose the warriors of bltaneh, who bar collected up to 3 0 Fedais, several hundred Kurds and ?'0 Askers, ieljid-;'ultsneh is a Persian of liberal views who for nearly ten years lived at Tiflis. Ais children were educated in ‘.ussian elucational institutions, nevertheless he has considered it his duty to place himself at the head cf Brigand bands and to enter into conflict with Ihissia. According to telerraphic information, the Governor of Buj-Bulak was compelled to escape to liandab at night. The peaceful population of the latter place hau moved to liarafiia. Young Gaiasan-Khen with his laountel men, about 1,500, has arrived at Miaadab ami is constructing fortifications. It is persistently rumoured^ that the Governor of Maragha is in secret relation with Cuj-Eulak in view of which the population is very nervous. Both the followers of amsan and his enemies are arriving at Karsgha. Tntil quite recently the Askers at -uj-bulak refused to side with any of the detachments there. Hut under pressure from the Kurds who threaten to set fire to Sui-Bula* sho &lt;li the urks refuse to join then, the latter have boon obliged to enlist in : e jid- Sult men 'n de t ac; ;rien t . Disturbances are similarly tai ing place in the re? ion of Dj&amp;shtanent; the Fhahsevao tribes here have already commenced to tillage. The Chief of the xcise Administration reports, that he ani his officials are practically besieged and all the roses'being' occupied hy HhahsevanB, they are unable to remove their property and the archiver of their office. The sad experiences of toe Christians* compel the population to wait until the horizon brightens, heeret preparations are everywhere being made. The Kurds have many sympathisers amongst the Persian population of these regions. The Governor of Puj-Bnlak has telepyaphed to the Governor- General of Aserbaii m in regard to the situation. The latter has instructed K-ediid-hltaneh by tele rap! to re nee die mischievous activity, and to take into consideration the solemn promise given by Persia to maintain her neutrality and to return to ybreeju Medjid-3ultanah replied that he is net a renegade and is not disloyal to his PatlierlanA like Governor General Kardar-V.ashied and Moharem- T Jl-&lt;^ulk the- Governor of nragha were, tl\at he will continue to protect the interests of Islam md will enter Tabroes only as- victor.

Secret enquiries are being made by me but while I have learnt nothing definitely as yet there are various small indications that negotiations of some kind are on foot. I submit that His Maiesty’s Government should consider whether it is not prudent for us and Russia to offer a defensive (alliance?) with Persia in v le w of there hemg a possibility of a Persian alliance with Germany and such an alliance now that we are within a few days of taking Baghdad, if concluded would not inTolye employment of any considerable number of troops probably indeed only sufficient to hunt down Germans, &amp;c., now in Persia and such numbers as Russia seemed disposed to send would suffice for that purpose. But very considerable financial inducements would have to be held out possibly can cellation of all or some of Persia’s debts and probably integrity of Persia would have to be guaranteed. A hostile Persia on the other hand would be most embarrassing to us. To say nothing of commercial loss it means a free road '^Afghanistan and a threat, though not very formidable perhaps to our military operations in Mesopotamia. Moreover if Government here entered into war against us I am convinced that no financial inducements would keep Soulefand Kavam or even Bakhtiari faithful to us unless military aid was sent them I would suggest therefore that we open negotiations for a defens ive alliance. At the least discussions would delay settlement of any agreement with Germany and give time for the arrival of Russian troops. A lew troops ^already 1 reported have been landed and Germans will naturally be spurred nn hv their appearance to make every effort to commit Persian Government to thei/side before force is large enough to overawe pro-German party. . ■ „ • t u,, p ssen tial tiling and I propose to take an early opportunity to discuss proposition (?) with Minister for Foreign Affairs.

I replied that owing to the very dual attitude of his Govern ment, I must make a reference in the matter to His Majesty’s Government but it was I thought unlikely that the two Governments would agree to pay money that might be used against us. The Germans, it seems to me, were try ing to repeat their coup at Constantinople where, they had jockeyed Turkey into war, a few months after her conclusion of a loan in Erance. It is very probable, I think, that in the promised reply some further design will be included by the Persian Government. Minister of Eoreign Affairs (remarked ?)

A statement has been read to me by the Russian Minister, on instructions from Petrograd, to the effect that whereas Russia agreed by the 1907 Conven tion to respect Persian independence she will, in future, if Persia now enters into an agreement, will (with ?) our enemies, seek the destruction of Persia. Minister for Foreign Affairs repeated denial of any convention and said that Persian Government would send us a reply re Moratorium to-morrow with which “ we shall be more than satisfied.” The Russian Minister thinks that if the reply is satisfactory, as is promised, instructions had better be given to the bank by us to open an account as public opinion will be conciliated by the payment of arrears of salary to officials which, if long expected money were withheld, could be easily aroused against us here (as?).in the early days ot Moharem. Moreover the acceptance of scheme by the Persian Government is tanta mount to a declaration (of) a policy which is favourable to us. I, therefore, propose to issue instructions to the bank to make advances of money. As it seems possible Hamadan may be again (will ?)

From Noel at(?) Daril Khazina following telegram has been received No. 193, dated 30th instant : “The observations I now make are the outcome of a full discussion with Soane and Young of the Bakhtiari situation :— (a) Latest information is that nine days ago three rebel Arab Sheikhs from Fallahieh and Agha Noorullah Sayyid Esas reached Qahwaruk accompanied by one thousand Mujahidin and are com mitted to march on Arabistan. We consider this information as authentic. The possibility of Young’s mission to Khans is definitely precluded by this. (b) All information to hand points to correctness of Soane reports my telegram No. 179 and Young now thinks that we must accept the fact that Khans are, though not openly, co-operating now with the Germans. (c) If Persia decides to enter the war Muhtasham and other Khans will take their cue from Tehran no inducement(s) we can offer them will detach (them from ?) Perso-German cause. We however, make reservation that if the action of the Persian Govern ment is disapproved of by Bahadur and Samsam Assad and in consequence they were to leave Tehran no move will be made against us by the Bakhtiari. (d) Arshad-ed-Dowla, acting Governor, Dizful, continue to (be) actively V ' hostile to us. The object of his impending visit to Mohammerah is it is credibly reported, to be to sound the ground with a View to win Sheikh over to the Bakhtiari cause. _ _ (el Every day that policy (of) drift continues and Bakhtiari approach ^ nearer to Arabistan our position is weakened and the possibility of our being able to secure the adherence of friendly or neutral element is prejudiced. From the point of view of the local situation here and on Dizful side it would seem to be of great advantage if Bakhtiari were forced to show their hands by the presentation of ultimatum or other means. I ^ There is a possibility if we decide to hold the field of coming to an (/) agreement with Ohahar Lang which if it does not secure their co-operation might discount, as potential enemies, their impor tance However, owing to inter-tribal quarrels and hostile feelings fgalnst Vs it would be dangerous to count on above possibilities or on the strength of it to make any change in the military disposition's) ^ ^ otll e r hand far more satis- (fc) The situation also seems to ^Th^is^ n^time to do so. Nor” tmASanGovernment should be seized by us forthe Sheikh now that it is still possible.6 | If situation is not brought to a head (soon ?) and if the Bakhtiari are permitted to have the same opportunity themselves and infect the so far unaffected tribal element, the possibilities of the whole of nothern Arabistan going over to the enemy must be faced by us. The necessity for immediate action is therefore again urged by us. J late (i) It is obvious that until the Khans show their hands, the oil-fields cannot be abandoned. It seems to me, on the other hand that the policy drifting and hang(ing) on to the last at the oil-fields would make it very difficult successfully to evacuate them. We therefore, consider that the situation should, from the point of view of the oil company, be brought to a head and if Persia enters into the war unless it is determined to send up troops to hold them, the fields should be evacuated. In case of the English Companies in Asia Minor, we would point English* Staff. “ “ ^ TurkS “ most to impr!2 the Repeated Mohammerah and addressed to Sir P.

From—His Britannic Majesty^ Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. Please refer to my telegram No. 430 of the 1st instant. Prom a good source I hear that in return for benevolent neutrality a sine qua non of Persian requirements is the withdrawal of Bussian troops from Persia. It will be clear if this should be the case that there is nothing to hope for by diplomatic means unless possibly some concession(s) of a very extraordinary nature are made on our part— such as a promise of a nominal share in the possession of Mesopotamia and the taking over of Persian debts. In the capital and in vital parts of the country the German position is so strong however that I doubt much whether even so the Cabinet which is I think sincerely anxious to avoid being dragged into the war, is powerful enough to stand against them. And I fear that conscious of their own impotence the Ministers will put impossible demands m order _ to bring on us the responsibility for refusing them and save their own face m this way. Still as I understand His Majesty’s Government wish to gain time we must I think show ourselves friendly and respond to their overtu^s and V is^|;i^ this object in view that Russian Minister and I are agreed that the moratorium should be put into force.The position is, our best informed friends here say, the virtually lost and it is significant that some of them are wishing to leave the capital, for instance, Parma Parma who has (given ?) loyal support, while in view of apparently positive information in your possession (? it is difficult) to feel optimistic. The immediate arrival of a really large Russian force at Kasvin is the only possible means of restoration of the situation but such action must not be delayed. There are now at Kasvin five thousand men hut the General Officer Commanding is naturally reluctant to move Tehran with his long line of communication with Enzeli unguarded. There are however people who believe that provided reinforcements are on the way the risk may he taken. If he receives instructions from headquarters the General Officer Command ing will move two regiments to Tehran but without giving us notice here this step should not be taken. Failing the supply of troops in considerable numbers it seems in the circumstances we are as likely to stave off a rupture for a little while longer by negotiations as by any inadequate measures of a military nature which might very well precipitate (? matters).

Reference to Marling’s telegram 504 F, 1st December. While realising that Marling must be sole judge of actual situation in Tehran, I cannot help suspecting that Shah’s sudden desire for alliance with all Allies has been prompted by pro-German advisers at German instigation in order to give Germans time for completion of their plans without interference from Russian troops. Prompt action against rebel gendarmerie and mujahidin at Hamadan, whatever Persian Government may say, would appear essential in order to effect cutting communications of the German marauders with Turkey, and thus isolate them.

I /’ %*■' , \ y \jL&gt; I have not exact knowledge of extent of General Nixon’s reverse, but judging from Viceroy’s telegram No.118 of yesterday it appears to have been far more serious than indicated in any telegram I have received yet. If. this, is so,chance of concluding an alliance with Persia is most un favourably affected. BagMad being (?) relieved and Nixon being presumably in no position to resume advance for the present. I submit it may be assumed that enemy will devote all his attention to his main objective, i.e. forcing Persia into war .against us. This will best be achieved by sending all troops that can be spared from watching Nixon into Persia with practical certainty of raising at least the Western provinces against ue. Appearance of Turkish aw reinforced by gendarmerie and by local levies already being collected, will fire Persia with hope of driving out Russians, and this combine with promises held out by Germans as stated in your telegram. No. 427 will make it extremely hard for any Cabinet to join us, except on terms of a most attractive kind n fact we have to outbid the German terms so neavxlj outweigh disadvantageous military position in which we outweigh Q Turkish force appears i* ■'Nghall be to Persian eyes if and when here „ ..U^ian troops are now in I do not know how many xiusoianPersia but. ali accounts place them at a far lower figure than we have been led to expect. Russian Minister believes that the Grand Duke intends to send 40,000 altogether. In the contingency I foresee this will he none too many. Having twice put us off Prime Minister,now promises to inform us of Persian requirements on Monday hut I have learnt privately that following points are being considered by Cabinet, 1. Cession (to?) Persia (of?) territory.embracing the holjr places including Khadimain together with Baghdad. 2\ Cancellation of all Persia’s debts to the two Powers. 3. Two Powers to supply arms and ammunition for 50,000 men. 4. Large monthly subvention during war. 5. 1907 Convention to be abrogated. 6. Stipulations of 1911 ultimatum to be cancelled. 7. Large modifications of treaty of Turmanchai. 8. After the war loan of eight million pounds to be arranged by international Syndicate. 9. Revision of tariff. 10. Foreigners to possess real estate in Persia on the same conditions as in Turkey* 11 The Two Powers to guarantee tha independence and integrity of Persia, I have, of course, warned the Prime Minister against making exorbitant terms, such as point I, but I have no great confidence that he will be strong enough to stand firm against the pertinacious pro-German party in the Cabinet, possibly the whole list may be presented to us. IfIf my appreciation of Nixon’s.position and its con sequences is approximately correct it appears to me immediate acceptance, of Persian terms affords the only, hope of securing the alliance, hut oh that, Considering the opportunity there will he for. the pro-Germans to prolong negotiations, the chance is net a rosy one. As regards point II, I would remark that the oait of Holy places would secure us support of any number of tribesmen when Nixon is again able to advance. On the other hand his communications along the Tigris with the frontier tribes hostile would be to say the least of it, very seriously hampered.

Minister for Foreign Affairs with whom 1 discussed question yesterday promised to instruct the Russian Minister to press negotiations and said ne was sending me an aide-memoire on the subject. It has just reached me and is to the following effect. “Russian Minister at Teheran has forwarded to Minister for Foreign Affairs list of conditions which, according to information from a confidential source, Teh eran Cabinet intends to seek in exchange for the con clusion of a Treaty of Alliance with Russia and Great . Britain. These conditions are said to be as follows:- 1. Certain territorial acquisitions. 2. Certain financial compensations. 3.

Russian Government have accordingly considered it necessary to make it clear to the Persian Government that it is to trie interest of the latter to secure the friendship of its powerful neighbours and that it should therefore abstain from requesting ^cessive conditions. Russian Government are of opinion that the first three of the above points might be perhaps accepted with certain reserves.
