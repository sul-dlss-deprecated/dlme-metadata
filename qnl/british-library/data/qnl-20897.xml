PROPOSED ESTABLISHMENT OF TELEGRAPHIC COMMUNICATION BETWEEN BUSHIRE AND BAHREIN. /• r No. 156, dated Bushire, the 17th November 1902. From— Lietitenant-Colonbl C. A. Kemball , Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to report that the Assistant Political A^ent at Bahrein has brought to my notice that he has been repeatedly approached by the British Indian traders of that place on the subject of the great advantage which would accrue to Bahrein, from a commercial point of view, if Bahrein could be brought into telegraphic communication with the outside world. The commercial importance of Bahrein is undoubtedly increasing, and it is certainly probable that if telegraphic facilities could be given, the place which is now annually increasing in importance, would still further develope. A reference to last year's trade report will show that the trade of India with Bahrein is of very considerable importance. From a political point of view the establishment of telegraphic communi cation between Bushire and Bahrein would be most convenient, and it would, of course, afford a further material proof of the interest taken in the place by His Majesty's Government. The distance between Bushire and Bahrein is 170 miles and the laying of a cable between the two places could easily be effected. I am unable to say what the cost would be, but it would, I think, be prohibitive if the line is required to pay its own way, that is, to pay the usual interest on the cost and meet the working expenwSes. Mr. Gaskin estimates that at present the receipts at Bahrein would amount to about Rs. 10,000 annually, but I am unable to vouch for the approximate accuracy of the figure. I understand, however, that great improvements in the working of the ' Marconi' wireless system have recently been effected, and that at any rate before long the system will be so improved that it will be an easy matter to establish communication by this system over the short distance which separates Bushire from Bahrein. If t am correct in this supposition, and if, as I understand, the cost of establishing the communication by means of the Marconi system is not likely to be large, I trust that the importance, both commercial and political, of tho project may be considered. No. 570-E., dated Fort William, the 23rd March 1903. From—The Officiating Under-Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To—Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball , C .I .E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, I am directed to reply to your letter No. 156. dated the 17th November 1002, regarding the establishment of telegraphic communication between Bushire and Bahrein. 2. The cost of laying down a cable would be prohibitive, but your sugges tion to connect the places by wireless telegraphy will be borne in mind. The systems have not been sufficiently perfected to warrant the adoption of any one of them by the Government of India in the Persian Gulf. 241 F D.—S E-31-32 —May. Exd.— W. G.

Sir, I have the honour to revert to the oorreapondence ending with Foreign Department letter Jo. 570 -E dated 85rd !.-aroh 1903 on the subject of telegraphic communication between Duahire and Bahrein. 2. It will, I feel sure, be conceded that the 5 yeara which have^ elapsed have seen a considerable development both of the commercial and political aspects of our position in the Persian Gulf general ly. Thus in 1904 Political Agents of the Government of India were appointed to the ports and territories of Koweit and Bahrein, a measure which has brought with it the more frequent need of speedy intercommunication in connection with official business. Then again, questions connected with the Quarantine Service of the Gulf (administered by us for the Persian Government) and affect ing the working arrangements in force at the various porta of, ateamer call including Bahrein and Koweit have been greatly in evidence, owing both to the proviaions of the last Paris Convent ion and to the increasedly jealous criticism of our regime indul ged in by the representatives of Foreign Powers. Difficulties both with Bahrein and /Coweit have already arisen from time to timetime in thlo oonneotlon owing to the inability of the Residency burgeon as Chief of the Service to get into speedy ooarjnunication with either port, especially Bahrein, to which there Is only a fortnightly mall. Next, I would allude to the traffic in smuggled arms from the Arab to the Persian shore which has of late assumed such alarming proportions. It is most desirable that British Officers at all ports which are closely identified with the traff ic should bo in telegraphic communication with one another and with His ajesty's Ships. I.ast, but not least, must be remembered the active competition of Foreign Powers ennecially Germany at the present moment with our seaborne trade, a consideration which makes it of the utmost importanoe that we should place every possible facility in the hands of our own merchants likely to assist them in the struggle. The power to communicate by telegranh with their principals in India is one patent way in which they can be helped if we may judge from their repeated re^reflentations for Cable extension. All these considerations, 1 submit, combine to accentuate the desirability, not to say the necessity, of linking up both ports telegraphically, and there is no doubt that the measure would be cordially welcomed by the Arab Chiefs concerned. At the time my predecessor placed the matter before the Covemment of India both the Jable and Tireless systems were Indeed considered, but at that epoch Cable extension was held to be too expensive a measure, while the existing Wireless systems were adjudged insufficiently perfected to warrant adoption in the Persian Gulf, ^ince then. Wireless telegraphy has made great strides and in view of the other developments above indicated, I now venture to submit the question for consideration. 5. I recently tool: an opportunity of consulting the officiating Director Persian tiulf Telegraphs on the subject generally. I gathered from him that the cost of Cable extension to Bahrein alone would probably be from to 6 La-ihs initial and 7000 rupees annual recurring exnendlture: w; ereas in the case of a wireless installation the initial expenditure for installations at Bahrein and liushire would be well under one .akh and the monthly recurring expenditurea expenditure about Rupeeo 1000/- for each station* Thus it appears that in the course of ^5 years the Govemraent of India would have incurred about the same expenditure whichever syston were adopted. The Department of the Director Persian Gulf Telegraphs favours the cablo altematlve t partly perhaps because they have hitherto had no connection with and no first-hand exDerience of tireless, and naturally incline to the system with which they are familiar# The Director considers that as far as Bushire is concerned, presuming always that the installation was adjacent to the present (able offices at Ueshire as it naturally would be f the instrument could be worked throe times a day for an hour at a time by two of the existing staff of the Indo-i uropean Telegraph Department Signallers* At . ahrein on the other hand, he is of opinion that two men would be absolutely necessary, one to be inccharge of the instruments and one for signall^ihij duties. I do not quite see myself why the electrician should not tat also ^sicnalling but in any case the contingency of sickness has to be taken into account. 4. Supposing that .Lowoit were brought into t?:e system as well as iiahreln, the initial and recurring cost would be the same for that port as for I ahreinj but in this case the Director considers it would probably be necesrsary to provide an extra Signaller at Bushire in order to give oweit the requisite number of comnuni- cating hours as well as ahrein. 6. A wireless Installation would of course be more serviceable for all work connectod with His I ajeety's ships and this to ray mind is a most important consideration in favour of that system. aving regard to t:ie distance at which they have to lie off the shore, the ability to communicate by tireless would be of the greatest advantage to thorn both for purposes of comnunicatlion of news or sailing plans in rough weather and also for intimating their requirernonts in the way of coal and provisions whan approach ing the ports. At the present moment £is Majesty's Uhips 'Highflyer' and 'Proserpine' now on arras duty in the Gulf find their wireless inBtallatlons rinetallatlone moot useful anfl I am otrongly of opinion that the three veaaelB oubsldieed by the Govemirent of India should likewise be fitted with ouch If praotlcable. Trusting that the olrcurstancee will be oonaldered to warrant a reconsideration of the question.

Mackenzie , Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to inform you that Mr. Eoever, Bahrein Agent of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company, visited me on the afternoon of the 3rd August and in the course of conversation asked me whether he thought Sheikh Esa would have any objection to his erecting a telephone line between Manama and Muharraq, where the firm has a branch Agency generally superinteuded by a Persian named Abdulla bin Ahmed. I replied that altghouh Doctor Mylrea of the American Mission had a telephone between his house and his hospital (a distance of some two hundred yards) the new proposal was a very different matter and I thought that Sheikh Esa would most probably object. He then asked if he sent me an application whether I would a ddress the Chief on the subject. I answered in the affirmative knowing that I could always obtain a negative answer from Sheikh Esa. The attitude that would be adopted by Government was not enquired into by Mr. Hoever and I saw no necessity to bring in that issue. Sheikh Esa may well reply that it would compete unfairly with the ferry men, and the telephone posts would also be a nuisance and that he does not care to give up a long slice of land for this purpose. 2. I asked the Agent of Messrs. Gray Paul (next day) whether they were ever likely to desire a telephone to Muharraq and he replied in the negative. None of the Indian traders would be sufficiently progressive to wish for a telephone and therefore it could only be to the advantage of the German firm, as this Agency would have no use whatever for it. 3. Erom a financial point of view I am sure that the telephone would be a failure, unless a general exchange was erected and the Hindus and others allowed to call up their business relations on payment of a fixed fee. Even then I am doubtful as to whether it would be a paying concern, as the line would be long and expensive. They might have the idea of placing the junior Agent in Muharraq, but I do not think this probable. As, however, there appears to be no advantage in permitting a spread of influence, I will verbally advise the Chief to reply in the negative should any proposal to this effect be made. 4. When I had replied that I would address the Chief on the subject of the telephone, if officially desired by him to do so, Mr. Roever remarked that their Company was also anxious to instal a wireless system between here and Bushire, and asked what the Chief would think of that. I replied that I knew Sheikh Esa was adverse to innovations, and added that the question of telegraphic communication between Bahrein and Bushirehad been discussed before now but that I had heard nothing about it for some time. I then asked if his Company had sanctioned the expenditure, and if he knew how much it would be, lie answered that according to some oxpeiimonts he had made in South America the cost would be about ten thousand pounds sterling but that the recurring cost would be very little. This shows that if his company had ordered him to approach me on the subject, they had either not made out a competent estimate or they had not informed him of the cosk He said that there was no doubt the Company would sanction the amount required. 5. The conversation then came to an end and the following day I consult ed Mr. Milborrow of JVIessrs. Gray Paul as to the commercial^ prospects of the scheme. 6. On considering the matter I came to the conclusion that although the correspondence was confidential, I ought to inform Mr. Roever that you had addressed the Government of India on this subject and the question was under consideration. I therefore visited him on the 5th and gave him this inform ation and I trust that my action will be approved. 1 then asked whether any negotiations had been made in Bushire. To this he replied in the negative. 7 The nearest estimate I can make for receipts is that about 100 telegrams would be despatched from here weekly during the pearl buying season-3 months, while for the rest of the year about 30 or 40 telegrams would be sent weekly. Of course this is merely guess work and the number of telegrams would necessarily vary according to the rates fixed. 8. I can hardly believe that Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company anticipated that they would ever be permitted to erect a wireless installation, and 1 fancy that the enquiry was made with an idea of trying to force our hand. The combined proposals show clearly their forward policy even in face of iinancial loss. 9. It is needless to say that telegraphic communication would be warmly welcomed by all the mercantile community. I - tv)I Ho. •' ' ^ of 1913. i- 0 JL.

My dear Lorimer, The Colonel will have told you that I am arriving in Bahrein on August 20th. The object of my visit is the answering of conundrums about the proposed new wireless buildings. The question of the site having been decided, I am required to 'collect all the information necessary regarding foundations, suitable material for construction, cost of same, labour available &amp;c. If the site is at all confined it win be necessary to survey it. For this 3 khaiassls are necessary. A hole should be dug to see what the foundations are like. It should go down to something suitable for bulldln^ on. The local practice as regards foundations will probably be suf ficiently good as the buildings will not be very heavy. Could you arrange to have this hole dug? Could you also let me know the present.costs of stone, gutch, sand, mud, labour, coolies, masons, carpenters, ic. with any other information you think will be useful for preparing estimates. I am sorry for worrying you with all these things; but needs must when the Colonel drives; though I haven't dared tell him so. However, I know your appetite for toil. Yours sincerely.

The Sheikh seems quite reconciled to the idea and is going to give me a deed of gift for the site according to ay measurements and specifications. I hope that the intontion is to start right away with the Station here: the season for building is now on us, no labour being, as of course you know, available in the pearling season; further it would be very desirable to get the Statior working properly before next pearling season if possible, as that Lieut-Golonel Sir Percy Cox, ) K • 0 .1 • K . , C ♦ o .

I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government 1 1 of India, a communication received from No. 419, dated 14th July 1913. the Political Agent, Bahrain, in which he presses the growing need of Bahrain to be placed in telegraphic communication with the outer world. Major Trevor fears that the Wireless project for the Gulf, now under con sideration may have suffered some set-back and presses the claim of Bahrain for independent treatment. I have no reason to suppose that the scheme is being shelved, but with reference to Foreign Department telegram No. io-S., dated 4th February 1913, I beg to be informed how the matter stands and to express the hope that orders for the commencement of building work w'dl not be long delayed. No. 429, dated 14th July 1913. From— major A. P. T revor , C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrain, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to address you on the subject of the proposed Wireless installation at Bahrain. If the delay is likely to be excessive, or if the scheme is likely to be dropped, I venture to urge that the proposed Installation for Bahrain may be considered separately. A Station here sufficiently powerful to communicate with Jask would put Bahrain into telegraphic communication with the world, and would fall in with the general scheme later if the latter were ever adopted. I do not know whether the installation would have to be more powerful than that sanctioned for Bahrain in the General Scheme, but at any rate I presume it would not have to be very much more powerful. I beg to observe that the need for telegraphic communication at Bahrain is very great especially during the pearling season. In the last 10 years the total trade of Bahrain has increased from under 2 crores to 6| crores, and the place has been going ahead in other ways. This year 4 different jewel firms—3 French and 1 English—have sent representatives to buy pearls. These gentlemen are naturally most anxious to get into telegraphic communication, and during their stay of 3 or 4 months here they would, I am sure, use the Wireless Station a great deal. During the last few years Messrs. Rosenthal the first of these firms to come to Bahrain, has spent about 60 or 70 lakhs annually, and it would be worth his while to spend a considerable sum in order to keep in touch with the markets. Further, attention was drawn in the Bahrain Trade Report for 1910-11 to the tendency of Qatar and Katif Pearl merchants to deal direct with Bombay. If Bahrain were in telegraphic communication with the various pearls markets, and Qatar and Katif dealers were able to assure themselves that Messrs. Rosenthal and the other European merchants here were offering the correct rates, it would I think, assist in making Bahrain the recognised market for the Gulf .Pearl Trade. During the cold weather there would not be so much traffic, but I think there would be a fair amount in connection with the ordinary business of the place which is fairly brisk, I regret that I am unable to make any estimateof the amount of traffic likely to take place; I have not the requisite knowledge of the subject. It does not seem desirable to discuss the matter with the Pearl merchants in order to find out what they would be likely to spend, or whether they would be prepared to guarantee any regular income for the office during the summer months. In the circumstances therefore I am afraid I have not been able to supply any useful data on which the possible traffic of the Station at Bahrain could be estimated, I think, however, that if the Station were equipped and managed on economical lines, there should be a good prospect of its paying its way. In any case the establishment of Wireless Communication would be an inestimable boon to the merchants and traders of the Islands. C43FD—44—I-8«I3—GCBP SimlaKogr *4 Docket Telegram.

Under the altered conditions# the case of Kuwait is not so pressing, fblitically and conmercially a land line via Zobeir to Basrah would probably be more satis factory and reliable and messages for wireless aysten would then connrct with wireless at Basrah.

Cox.The Chief political Officer, BASRAH. BAFTRAIN. The Ifith Auruat 191^, if/ Memorandum, Your telegram No.3632 of 3rd instant. 1. After oonvoroation with Vr. L.G.pearoe in oharre of the Vcireleas station here, and insnection of the wireless site in connection with the proposed wall or fence, I have come to the followinf: conclusions. 2. Both in order to facilitate work in the wireless station, and for the convenience of Its staff, it is neces sary to have some sort of barrier round the enrine room and the building where the staff live, as well as round the servants quarters. 3. I gather from Mr. ^earce that the original intention was to have a wall enclosing the whole of the wireleis site including the masts. This wall would be some 240^ feet long, cost about Rs.12,000/- (according to the estimate of the Public orks bepartment Overseer he^e rrho erected the wireless buildings), and interfere with n ri^ht of wav, which would probably cause friction with the local autho rities . 4. After consultation with Mr. Pearce I be/^ to surest the alternative of a barbed wire fence round the engine room, the staff building, and servints quarters. This would nrevont the trespassinf of the promiscuous public, and would also include threebf the masts in its circle. ith r^fe^ence to the other two masts outside a barbed ^rire fence and a live-wire could be erected roun^ ouch o^ them, the latter connected unierrround with the enrine room from wMchwhich it could be electrified, together with the barbed v/ire fence, under the circuristance^ mentioned in para 5. 5. The defence of the wirelona aite would beet be con ducted by rifle fire fror? the roof of the staff buildinr, from which an exceptionally ^ood field of fire can be obtained all roun^ • WitT&gt; sand bap-s to auppler-ent the parapet, the roof couli bo made well sheltered fro^ fire. The same remarks apjbly to the enrine-room, except that beinj* lower its field of fire is not so irood. A live-wire could be run round the barbed wire enclosure, and could bo electrified if an attack threatened, wblch would form a more formidable obstacle than a wall. 6.- To sum ut £ a barbed wire fence as supleated would seew to me to have the following advantages over a walli- (1) Juot as effective for keeping out the nromiscuous public. (2) Just as effective for defensive purposes. (3) Much cheaper. 7. I a f tach a conmunication from *'r. Pearce, to whom i havo shown L'iu report, in which vou will see that he con cur a in my suggestion.He^ardin^; your latter to Sir Poroy Cox I concur on ov^ry point ■Copy of a letter from I. D. Elliott, Esq., Under-Secretary to the Government of India in the Department of Commerce and Industry, to all Local Governments and Adminis trations, No. 4722—116, dated Simla, the 20th June 1916. The~Government of India have under consideration measures for checking the present serious delays to telegraph traffic throughout the country. The steady increase in the volume of traffic cannot, in the^ financial circumstances, be met by adding to the number of lines; the congestion is accentuated owing to the war by a very heavy increase in actual signalling operations due to the abnormal length of important State telegrams, many of which have to be collated; and'at the same time the telegraph personnel has been largely depleted by the demands of the military authorities for the telegraphic services in the field. 2. The present strain can be relieved only by exercising stricter control over the use of the telegraph, and the attention of all Departments of the Government of India has consequently been invited to the need for co operating in the following directions in checking the congestion of traffic. Officers must be responsible for securing that telegrams are not sent where the object could be obtained, without inconvenient delay, by ordinary corre spondence through the post: if, however, it is desirable to use the telegraph, officers must prevent the unnecessary use of Express messages, and in parti cular, if cypher telegrams are used should reduce their length to the smallest possible limit. It is laid down as a measure of equal importance that tele grams should be sent from the departmental offices to the Telegraph Office in as steady a flow as possible, arrangements being made for their issue in batches at regular intervals during office working hours, with the proviso that no telegrams, other than very urgent messages, should be sent to the Telegraph Office after four o'clock in the afternoon. A very limited staff can be kept on night duty in the Telegraph Offices and the inevitable result of the present office ^practice of accumulating the majority of the day's telegrams for issue in one large batch in the evening is to block the lines in all directions. 3. Instructions to the above effect are being issued in all Imperial Departments, and the Government of India trust that Local Governments and Administrations will assist in reducing the delay in traffic by giving similar instructions to officers under their control. r, &amp; P.
