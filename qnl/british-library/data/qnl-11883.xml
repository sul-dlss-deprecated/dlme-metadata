In winter the average number of camels arriving in Tabriz from Trebizond is about 500 per month, the journey being done in about 45 days ; in summer when camels can graze along the route, the number falls to about 200, and the time taken is about 71 days. The road is closed periodically on account of snow.” Section (1) Tabriz Khoi ” line 3 after ct carriages,” add— Between Narand and Rlioi the road traverses a plain most of the way. It is protected by two Gendarmerie posts and was safe in Fehiuary 19zo. The road is not metalled or provided with bridges or culverts, which are not necessary most of the year ; fit for carts ail the year, and fit for motor cars—not lorries except from December to M^arch inclusive. 553 / After “ cart road ” 4th line from bottom insert :— “ Kizil Diza—Igdir was traversed by car in October 1924, 57 miles via Bayazid station.

A good metalled road constructed by the Russians during the war, passable for L. A. M. B. Cars. The majority of the culverts and smaller bridges have been washed away, necessitating slight detours which in wet weather would be liable to cause difficulty. The bigger bridges are in good order with the exception of the bridge at Navai, which on 25th July 1924 was unsafe, the river being crossed by making a5 detour to the East and making use of a ford about 400 yards above the road bridge ; this ford on above date had 12 water. The road avoids the village of Avoglu which is left about 3 miles to the North West. After leaving Navai no villages are traversed. Road joins main Julfa—Tabriz road about J mile South of the Julfa telegraph office. Supplies and water very scarce throughout the route. Recently remetalled and culverts built. Fit for cars at any time except after exceptionally heavy snowfall ”. Route No. XI (e), page 750 .— Epitome —after line 8 add— KHOI to MAKU. The road was made passable for motor traffic in the spring of 1924 and is now fit for L. A. M. B. cars in dry weather. It is a well aligned though unmetalled road which would be passable with difficulty in the event of its being required te carry much traffic in wet weather, as it would be liable to become very muddy. A few wooden culverts have been constructed, but the majority of these on 26th July 1924 were falling into disrepair. No bridges have been constructed over the water courses, and during wet weather wash-outs would be frequent. Between Kara Zamin and Shut the road passes over a spur of the mountains by means of steep winding curves dropping into the Shut valley. This portion of the road would be dangerous for Ford Cars unless brakes were in first class order. On the up grade guns would require to be double teamed. Four miles North West of Shut the road joins the alignment of the now-dismantled Shahtakhta-Maku-Bayazid railway, which it follows as far as Maku. From Maku to the Perso- Turkish frontier | mile North-East of Bazirgan the road is only a cross country track, although passable for L. A. M. B. cars in dry weather. _ The alignment of the road is as follows :—Khoi—Parchi— Karaziadin—Shah Bulagh—Kara Zamin—Shut—Maku. L. A. M. B. cars traversing this route shouldjcarry some strong planks for use on the culverts, and Ford Cars should have brakes renewed and carry spare brake bands.” Delete lines 9 and 10.

Trott, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Resht, during the months of May and June 1924. In some cases the stages done by Mr. Trott differ from those in the route book ; in order to facilitate reference, therefore, the stage numbers as shown in the official volume have been inserted. These notes should be read in close connection with the Routes in Persia, Volume II, 1922 and Fortescue’s Military Report on Tehran and adjacent provinces. Section (A ).—Route 2. RESHT—AMUL. Section (B ).—Route I. Stages 7—9. AMUL—SARI. Section (G). Route I (h) stages 9-1. SARI—ALIBAD— TEHRAN.8 / SECTION (A). Authority. —A. C. Trott. 1924. Route 2. Stages 1 and 2. Resht to Lahijan. (28 miles). At 3 miles, Razar-i-Aji-Bisheh, and river called Hakim No bin. At 3^ miles, Ja’farabad, with a post of one vakil and three cossacks. Then River Geisha-Demerdeh and a village called Baleh-Seh-Baneh. At 8 miles, village of Baleh-Dasht, with river No-rud. At 10 miles, brick bridge known as Murghaneh Pul. At 11 miles, Kuchisfahan; a bazar with a post of one Moin Naib and 5 men. At 13 miles, Bazar of Luleman. At Reshtabad is one Cossack post, of one N. C. O. and 3 men. The bridge mentioned in “ Routes in Persia ” Volume II, page 220 as being built in 1922 is completed ; it is a brick structure, and appear strong enough for Ford cars. The road from Resht to Lahijan is not properly looked after, though the passage over the Safid Rud between Reshtabad and Nisum is the only obstacle to the passage of vehicles of a serious nature. “ Drushkies ” pass to Lahijan occasionally, being placed bodily in the flat-bottomed ferry-boats on the Safid-Rud crossings. There are two branches which must be crossed. Bridges over these crossings would be considerable undertakings, as that over the West branch would have to be some 180 yards long, and over the smaller 100 yards. The channel also is often changing its bed ; and the pressure of water in the spring is very great. Apart from these crossings, the numerous culverts all need strengthening to make them suitable for light cars. In addition to the produce mentioned in “ Routes in Persia ” page 220, Lahijan produces beans, glass, wood-work, and silver qalian-fittings. Stages 3 and 4. Lahijan—Langarud—Rudisar. (18 miles). At 5 miles, small hamlet called Divshal. At Langarud is a Cossack post of one Sultan and twenty-five men. After Langarud, come to Kia-Kelayeh, and Kalid-Bar. The ford over the Salman or Shalman River is easily passable still (May 12th) though a bridge over this channel is badly needed.9 The name of the Kiah-Rud bridge was given as Sar-Pord, possibly a corruption of Sar-Pul. Stage 5. Rudisar to AB-I-GARM (Sakht-Sar). (25% miles). At 2 miles, village of Daria-Vasar. and River Kal-Darreh. At 2% miles, village of Kal-Darreh lies half a mile to the South. At 2% miles, opposite a prominent spur called Dust-Kuh, reach a point from which the first view of the sea is obtained. At 5 miles, Village Hassanak-Sara. The name “ Pul-i-Rud ” is often given as Pulu-Rud or even Pilau-Rud. At 10J miles, Chaijan—six huts. At 21 miles, the turning into the forest to get to Ab-i-Garm by the proper road is very difficult to find owing to the close forest; a guide is necessary. At 22 miles, Akhund-Mahaleh—200 families—a very large straggling village of 1,000 persons, with orange and lemon trees ; bazar on Tuesdays. Here the road crosses a river-bed bottom of which is composed of large round stones—a trickle of water is easily forded. At 23 miles, next village of Naranj-Bun. At 25% miles, the hot springs of Sakht-Sar, surrounded by some 50 houses ; the road just before reaching Sakht-Sar is over a steep acclivity and very twisted. StageS. AB-I-GARM to KHURRAMABAD (18 miles). (via SADAT-MAHALEH to SHIRUD on the sesi-shore, then to SHAH-SOWAR and then inland.) (Alternative route mentioned in stage 6 of Route 2). The road which goes direct to Khurramabad was not followed. It is cut in several places and is not now very much used. The road taken lay through village paths, often broken by irrigation cuts. General direction East to Shirud. At one mile from Sakkt-Sar (Ab-i-Garm) village of Ramak, famous for locally-woven silks, called “ alijeh ” as also is Sadat- Mahaleh, passed at 2% miles. At 3 miles, Katalan-Sar village; at 3|-, pass between the villages of Talish-Mahaleh and Kuzeh-Gar-Mahaleh, the former on the North, the latter on the South, side of the road.

At 12 miles, village of Vacheh. The going along the sea-shore is soft and stony, over sand for the most part. At 13 miles, Karimabad, opposite a prominent spur called Karakuh. At 13| miles is one of the branches of the River Mazar— easily fordable. At 14 miles, reach the middle of Shah-Sowar. This port is often visited by Russian ships from Meshed-i-Sar and Enzeli, as well as oy Turkoman boats. The greater part of the Sipah Salar s rice is sent from this port. It is an open village extending some 500 yards along the shore, with a customs official’s office and several storehouses. Here are stored rice, some oranges and lemons, skins, a,nd some wood for export. It has a post and telegraph office, but no jetty. All ships except tiny boats have o remain I mile out, and calling is only done in fine weather. At 141 miles, cross the second (East) branch of the Mazar River /n/r° CC \ aS10I n a 'T a ^ ons ^ era ^ e stream m the summer, but at present * eaS Jj J 1 ^ &gt;r a ^ e &gt; bed is very stony.

At 18 miles, Villages and River Ab-Rang, sometimes called Awrang, a broad river in spring. On the far side of it are situat ed some disused fishing sheds. At 18^ miles, ford over the river Chalus—the most serious ford encountered so far ; a local guide is necessary to go in front and pick out his way through the swift-running water. On the far or East side of the River mouth is the village of Majidabad. At 19 miles, the Rud-i-Gazaf—an overflow from the last named river. At 20 miles, Kurkureh-Sar RiverI 12 At 20i| miles, village of Kurkureh-Sar. At 22 miles, village of Kavaz-Kileh. it 22^ miles, Habibabad, on the coast; a few houses.

The road now strikes inland amongst dense trees; a guide is necessary, at any rate until the bed of the old Mahmudabad-Amul railway is reached, at miles, near the village of Tarikeh-Sar. Inence the road follows the former railway track. Terrible going is encountered at from 9 to 11 miles.

SECTION (B) Authority. —A. C. Trott, 1924. AMUL to SARI. Route I.—Stages 7—9. Stage 7 .— Amul to Barfurush (20 miles). At 2 miles, the River Khaliseh. At 4 miles, the village of Rush-Kelah is to the North. At 17 miles, the bridge of Mohammed Hassan Khan—it is now repaired. Nevertheless, the river bed appears to be chang ing, and may possibly cut the road on the East side of the bridge, guarding ramp is necessary to prevent this. Stage 8 .— Aliabad. No information.14 Sttaap 9 — Aliabad to Sari. (15 miles) (11)» i, the principal village of a large di.trlct of the same name. Cultivation is chiefly cotton, and occasionally rice, maiz an rim^al 6 direction N. E. Leave Aliabad by the Shah Abbas cause-wiw STL followed for 3J milee. The Ali.b^l cattle bazaar is eituated 1,000 yards S. E. of the Governor s house. At yi m iie S an ancient three arch bridge over the Siah End main channel, which is easily fordable at a crossing with a firmed gravelly bottom immediately below the bridge. A 2 the cause-way is left and a track taken to the South of it. At 4 miles is a single-arch “bridge” (brick) over a shallow water channel W to be a tributary of the Siah Rud. The road winds through 2ag a hn?vmages Ld in place at local guide is necessary. The S surffce is generally bad, but in places leads over open pas- tarage At 6 miles is the village of Attareh, and at 8 miles fte district of V.rid Sh.hr. At 10 t mite is the *stnct of &amp;ah Lnd with a small clearing in the middle of trees. The track winds through low foothills on the South side of the cause-way which is (o“ ed at 14J miles, the last J mile to S.ri bemg done on tL The”mcI*t»ken in this stage is the one generally in use at the time of vear (June); it is very tortuous and should not be regarded as a permanent road way. The traces of the Shah Abbas cause way are very broken, and in places completely washed away leaving deep mud holes. No traveller follows the cause-way, but makes use of Tracks lying to the South. The road for the most part is a mule track surrounded with cultivation and intersected r irrigation channels, but occasional good stretches of turf are met The road is flat except at the foothills m the vicinity of Sari where however there are no steep gradients. Stones abound and no insuperable obstacle would prevent a go° d ^ad beino- made ; it would need to be strongly guarded against the winter rains and sudden floods. Culverts would be required on an average every half mile, and the bridge of the Siah Rud would need repair. , . . Alternative stage Barfurush—San via iir Kalen. Stage 1 .— Barfurush to Tir Kaleh. (9% miles) (Degree Sheet 15 D. D. 2). The road is execrable throughout. On the outskirts of the town of Barfurush is a one-arch stone bridge over a small watercourse. The bridge is old and needs repair.15 me Aze bas ttle At lain and ailes At 4 nnel ingh sary. pas- miles Siah track -way ne on it the arded ;ause- away y,but most sected f turf .cinity 3tones 1 road ist the red on would Degree i stone . needs At 2| miles, a road branches off to the right to go to Aliabad.

From 4 to 5 miles the road becomes very uneven and full of pit-falls, especially for horses which are inclined to stumble. At 6^ miles a small group of huts known as Marri. About here a guide is very necessary ; the road twists about a great deal, at first to the north, and then again to the east. At 9 miles, ford the River Talar—the road twists round until it appears to be going west instead of east; the ford is shallow, with a firm gravelly bottom, 2 feet deep and 20 yards across. At 9| miles village and silk and cotton factory owned by Toumaniantz Brothers. The dense cultivation and vegetation all the way include rice- fields, a little cotton, and many kinds of trees growing wild ; reeds 15 feet high border the road in many places ; water channels have to be crossed again and again. Stage 2 .— Tie, Kaleh to Sari. (17 miles). Road leaves in a South-Easterly direction. At miles pass Seyyid Mahalleh—the road is through sparae jungle, of a rough surface which would be terrible in wet weather —this remark indeed applies to the whole road from Barfurush to Sari. At 4 miles, the district called Futun Mahaleh. At 5 miles, the road appears to bifurcate—take the right fork, which turns to the S. at an angle of 20 degrees to the direction it formerly had. The direct road leads to a district or “ mahaleh ” known as Siah-Rud. At 7 miles, Siah-Mahaleh. A bridge and ruined guard-house. The latter was built as a Gendarme posts in 1922, but is now in ruins. The bridge however, is good, of brick, and stone-paved ; it appears strong for all ordinary traffic ; at each corner of the roadway is a pillar surmounted by a small image of a horse. The bridge is 40 yards long, and of 5 arches. The roadway is 10 feet wide, with a small parapet of two feet. The River over which the bridge passes, called the Siah-Rud, has hardly any water at present. At 8^ miles, two culverts of brick in the last stages of dis repairs. At 10J miles, the district called Isanduq ; a few houses only ; much rice is grown here, and the road becomes lost in one or two \l 16 places owing to the encroachments of the cultivators. A guide is necessary. At 15 miles, met the Aliabad road ; from here travelled by the .Shah Abbas causeway, here in fair repair. At 16 miles, reach the outskirts of Sari, and cobbled roads. At 17 miles, the centre of the town and the Governor’s palace. General .—This route has been reported on very fully by 'Captain L. S. Fortescue ; see “Routes in Persia” Volume II pages 340 to 356, and pages 9 and 10 for the portion Sari to Aliabad. The following details therefore consist mainly of •information which is not included by him, and is meant to be read in conjunction with his report. Further general remarks on the route as a whole will be found at the end of this section III. Stage 10. — 9. Sari to Aliabad, June 14th 1924. (15 wiles). The road taken was the one in use at this particular time of year. But it was very tortuous and is in no sense to be regarded as a permanent roadway. The old trace of Shah Abbas cause way, which passed through both Sari and Aliabad, is very broken and full of stones and holes ; in many places also it is completely washed away and horses taking this path would sink in the mud up to their girths. No traveller at present follows the Shah Abbas road ; all keep closer to the foot-hills further to the south. Occasionally good open stretches of turf are met, but for the most part the road is a mule track surrounded with cultivation and intersected by irrigation channels. The whole surface is as flat as possible except when rounding the foot hills, near Sari ; and no steep gradients are met with even here. Stones abound, and no insuperable difficulty would prevent a good road being made ; except that it wnuld have to be strongly guarded against the winter rains and the chances of sudden floods. Culverts would have to be about once every half mile ; and the bridge over the Siah-Rud would need repair, as it looks as if it had been left untouched for 200 vears. Leave Sari by the old Shah x\bbas causeway, which leads in a straight line about W.S.W. At about half ti mile from Sari, leave the causeway and follow tracks on the south side to a •winding track skirting low foot hills* At 4^ miles come to the district called Siah-Rud, with a small clearing in the midst of trees. Ttvo miles further on enter the district of but us e Varii&gt;’ Shahr. and at 9 miles from Sari reach the outski rts of the village and bulus of Attareh. The road hitherto has been a track, usually of bad surface : in some places however it leads over openpasture land. A local guide is occasionally necessary when the track bifurcates. The road then twists somewhat, turning north, and then west again, through straggling villages. At 11 miles in single arch bridge of brick over a shallow water channel, said to be a tributary of the Siah-Rud. At 11J miles the old Shah Abbas causeway is met once more, with one telephone and one telegraph wire leading along it. At 13 J miles, an ancient three arch bridge over the Siah-Rud main channel, which is itself easily fordable now at a crossing immediately beneath the bridge. The bottom is gravelly and firm. At 15 miles, reach the cattle bazar of Aliabad, a collection of empty booths, empty save on the weekly market day. From thence to the Governor’s house in Aliabad is about 1,000 yards north-west. The last portion of the Shah Abbas causeway is the best part of the road; it is however stony and needs a great deal of work even on this portion to make it into a permanent and useful road for wheeled traffic of any sort. Stones for road-metal are everywhere very common. Cultivation by the road-side is mostly cotton occasionally rice-fields, maize, and poppy patches are seen. Aliabad is the principal village of a large bulus or district of the same name. The bulus comprises some fourteen villages. Its Governor is named Seyyid-i-Huzoor. SECTION (C). Authority. —A. C. Trott, 1924, (June 1924). SARI-ALIABAD-FIRUZKUH-DEMAVEND-TEHRAN. Route No. 1 (h) Stages 9-1. Stage 9-8 .— Aliabad to Shirgah. (11 miles). The Shah Abbas causeway is followed at first; it leads south, and is of a wide surface but very full of large stones, some rounded and some with jagged edges. Occasionally the irriga- rion of the rice-fields on either side had overflowed the road, thus making the going still more difficult. At 2 miles pass a small coffee-house, with upper rooms for Persian travellers. At 4 miles, the buluq of Haften ; and one mile further on the road begins to ascend gradually along the foot of the hills, on the west side being the swift-flowing River Talar, with a wide stony bed through which the river-channel twists and turns. Three culverts are crossed in quick succession.( 18 f the road now winding along the skirts of the low hills. In on# place the width is just sufficient for a Ford car to pass, but it appears likely that subsidence will take place. At 7 miles, pass a few huts called the village of Bishin. At 9 miles, the road crosses a gravelly-bottomed ford over a small tributary of the Talar; the approaches to the ford are steep, and for a car the road would need ramping. At 10-1OJ miles, there are difficult up and down gradients, about 1/6. A way round could however be found for a Ford car. At 11 miles, Shirgah ; a rice producing district, with a small rest-house on the top of the hillock some 200 yards to the east of the road. Shirgah contains five villages in all; it extends both sides of the river , and cultivates exclusively rice. The surface of the road throughout this stage is stony and tiring for animals’ feet. It is bordered with trees, including oak, elm, fig and azad. Stage 8 — Shirgah to Zirab. {13 miles). During this stage the Shah Abbas causeway is visible almost all the way, and is followed for the most part by travellers. It is in most places a succession of jagged projecting boulders, and is to be avoided whenever possible. It is on the up-gradient all the way, keeping to the side of the hills, and following the right bank of the Talar. At one mile the stony causeway commences. At miles is an old but strong stone culvert, and immediately after it the tea-shop known as Kharkan. The latter is also the name of large buluq, the principal village of which is situated on the left bank of the river. At 2 miles a deep gorge is entered, with the river roaring below, and densely wooded sides usually of a precipitous slope ; the surface of the road terrible beyond description. It is simply a succession of jagged stones, most of them of large size, neces sitating the most sure-footed of animals; they will almost certainly cast shoes at some places, in spite of slow and careful steps in clambering over the boulders. Throughout the gorge, large horse-flies are extremely troublesome inthe day time. At 4 miles, the gorge opens out to a small clearing called Takht-i-Rustam ; thereafter the gorge begins again. At U miles is a very steep and difficult ascent of 1/5, with several bad twists. Just after this is a strong brick one-arched culvert, which crosses a side tributary.19 At 6|- miles the road begins to show signs of having been scraped a little. At 7 miles, the buluq of Juvaram, with a small tea-shop. From to 8 miles the road passes by the side of the river bed iteslf, at the same level practically as the water and very close to it; the road is very difficult and sometimes dangerous, as a false step would mean a broken limb. The road has here become a mere track ; when in doubt which of two alternative tracks to take, the upper one which passes over the highest ground is the best. In places the traveller has to descend into the river itself. At 8 miles, the buluq of Surkh-Kaleh is reached ; and at 8J miles, on the opposite side of the river Talar is the village of Kurdkelah. Shortly after this the buluq of Zirab begins at a small tea- shop. The road hereafter is more open, and the gorge is now passed ; the surface consists of parallel mule-tracks, often stony and difficult ; the road however could easily be cut here. At II| miles the telegraph office of Zirab is passed, in the midst of a few straggling houses. At 13 miles, a tea-shop which marks the beginning of the Zirab area. Zirab possesses a telegraph office, as mentioned above, from which one can telegraph, in Persian only, to Aliabad, Barfurush and Tehran. The buluq is fertile, its crops being rice and some barley, and a few silk cocoons. The eggs for the last named have been introduced this year, the first time for many years, by the agents of the Amir-i-Akram, Governor of the province of Mazanderan. The road throughout the above stage is, as described, of an appalling surface, and no car or vehicle could pass. In the winter and in the spring the mud on the road and the swollen state of the river often interrupt communication for some days ; it is however usually possible for an adventurous muleteer who knows the lie of the land thoroughly to get through, by keeping principally to the actual river-bed, walking his animals through the water. Stage 7.—ZIRAB to SHABAR KHANEH (Arfadeh) of Surkh-Robat* district. {16 miles). ? (Note —This village is shown on Degree sheet as Sarabat.) The road lies still along the old track, which is sadly eroded in many places, so that there is no room even for two horses tot pass one another. This is especially the case in two or three re-entrants, where the road twists suddenly, near Zirab. At 2-J miles, a few huts known as Dafraq-i-Dudbar. At 4 miles, an ancient carving on a large stone on the left of the road, a landmark known as Tarikh-Sang. At 5 miles, the Pul-i-Safid bridge is crossed—it has three arches, and needs repair but will last a few more years before collapsing ; of brick, with small parapet, gradual slopes up and down to and from the bridge ; seven yards broad and 40 yards long—it would take a Ford car or any loaded Persian wagon. The road hereafter keeps along the left bank of the Talar, the surface being as before full of rough stones and in places very narrovr. At 6^ miles is the tea-shop known as Kilaj-Qushun. At 7 miles, Shurmast tea-shop ; the village of that name being situated 2 miles west of the road, in the hills. The cultivation hitherto seen is almost all rice ; a few patches of barley and wheat are also met with. At 8 miles, a small tea-shop. The road hereabouts is very tortuous, sometimes going up the side of the hills at an incline of 1/5 ; sometimes degenerating into a mere track of indescrib able difficulty for horses, with large stones everywhere. &lt; At 13 miles, district of Doab ; a deep valley goes off to the left or east side of the main cleft, in which our road lies ; the side-valley leads to Shahmirzad and Semnan. At 16 miles, the huts known as Chapar-Khaneh, after a dreary climb over boulders and projecting stones. Stage 7-6. Chapar-Khaneh (Afradeh) to the summit of the Qaduq of Firuzkuh Pass, (lij miles). The road lies still up the valley of the Talar, now a narrow but turbulent and rickey-bottomed stream. The track winds up through the valley past many small tea-shops ; no further rice cultivation is seen. Almost all sign of Shah-Abbas’ cause way has disappeared. At 3 miles the track crosses the stream, at a particularly stony spot, and hereafter the traveller has to make slow progress over the stony mountainous path. At 3^- miles is an especially difficult passage over slippery stone ; immediately beyond this are signs that attempts have been made to make a road, by scraping away loose stones ; no work of permanent value has however remained. At 4| miles Abbasabad tea-shop, the village lying some two miles off, on the west side of the road. Henceforward the road 1 £ 1 &lt; 1 I— 21 pursues its winding course; at 5^ miles is a difficult crossing over a side stream, which has completely washed away the track ; this tributary is not however very wide. At 6 miles, the traveller enters a rocky gorge ; a very well- defined natural feature, the worst part of which is some 300 yards long and 14 yards wide, with precipitous rocks on each side. The only way to progress is to walk through the river the whole way, though the bed is stonj- and not easy to make pro gress on. At 7^ miles, opposite ruins of an ancient stone stronghold, the road twists to the east slightly, leaving another valley on its right. Hereafter the road is sometimes in the river, sometimes on one side or the other ; a mere track in any case. The constant crossing and re-crossing, and the large stones, are wearisome. Finally the summit of the pass is reached at just beyond 11 miles after a steady climb ; and some 400 yards past the summit is the Guduq caravanserai, a typical Shah Abbas building of square hewn, stone, with a spacious though gloomy interior. Stage 6-5. Qaduq Pass to Namrud. {17\ miles). The road from the top of the pass is good, lying over an open plain, and passable for any kind of car. The slope is a gentle declivity. The surrounding country is for the most part covered with good grass. At 8-| miles, a branch to the N.W. to a village called Katalan, three miles distant. At 9 miles is a bad passage over a muddy streamlet; this would need bridging with a strong culvert to make it passable for cars. Otherwise the whole stretch from the top of the pass to Firuzkuh is easily passable for cars. At 11^ miles, a loop road leads off to the right, avoid ing the village of Firuzkuh which lies in the midst of trees on the left. The two roads join on the far side of the village. At 12 miles reach the Governor’s house at Firuzkuh. The village has 300 families and 40 shops. The Governor is Arshad-ul-Mamalik ; the post having been held by members of his family for some generations. The harvest is wheat, barley, and a little lucerne. The ground is not however very fertile, and the crop is about 4 or 5 fold. Cold winds prevail, usually from the North East. Trade with Semnad goes'on ; timber and grain are bought from that place, and locally woven fabrics such as jajims and namads are sent from Firuzkuh. From this place the road is comparatively good, being on a gentle downward slope, and, though somewhat stony, passable22 for all vehicles such as cars, if carefully driven. The country is open and any water channel met with could be circumvented easily by a small detour. At 15 miles, half a dozen houses known as Mulk-i-Salin, with wheat fields. At miles, cross the stony river bed of the Hableh-Rud, fordable and passable for cars. At 17J miles reach Namrud on the west of a river of the same name, flowing south ; the channel is 3 feet maximum depth, and the volume of water considerable. Bottom is of large and somewhat loose stones. Namrud consists of a few huts merely. Stage 5 — 4. Namrud to Dalichai. {14 miles). The road leads from Namrud straight uphill, pursuing a tortuous course through a stony river bed, dry at present. The surface, while not so bad as in the gorge between Shirgah and Zirab mentioned above, is nevertheless strewn with boulders and difficult for animals. At miles the first crest is reached. Thereafter the road zigzags and goes up and down over undulat ing country. No stiff gradients are met with yet. At 7 miles a road branches off to the south, going to Khar and Varamin. Occasional huts are passed but no large villages. At 8 miles, Aminabad, a sorry village of about 10 huts | mile north of the road. At from 9 to I Of miles, winding descents down a stony ravine, similar to the one ascended at the beginning of the Stage. There after the road becomes a mere goat-track, and needs completely re-laying to make it passable for any wheeled transport. At 11 miles a side stream has eaten away even the goat track, making a difficult crossing. From Ilf to 13 miles the road pursues a winding course down an almost precipitous hill-side, and then up similar places. At 12f miles a road has been com menced, having been cut out of the side of the hill, at a level up-gradient of 1/10, but the road was left unfinished, and the surface is terribly stony. At 13 to 13f miles is another cut, this time about the same gradient down-hill, and still of a stony surface At 14 miles, the valley of the Dali-Chai River joins from the north; the river itself is not an obstacle at this time of the year. It empties itself into the Hableh-Rud ; and is a SW1 _ owing stream with a bottom of large rocks and stones. e cuts mentioned above were made under the direction of Russian engineers in Persian employ in 1922, and as part of a scheme for making a motor road to Mazanderan. At I)ali- &lt;-hai a dump of tools was made, and a furnace constructed fori 23 baking bricks to be used in revetting the road ; but no adequate results remain. The efforts to smooth the road’s surface which are mentioned above between Shirgah and the Gaduq Pass were also the work of this party. Stage 4. —Dali-Chai to Sarba^dan. (9 miles). At 3 miles the top of the Dali-Chai pass is reached ; ascents are steep but passable for animals with greater ease than in the stretch Namrud to Dali-Chai. Surface is nevertheless stony ; some stones have been cleaned off the surface in places. Thereafter, a gradual descent to Sayidabad tea-shop, at 6 miles ; through a valley which runs west with few twists. The road now lies through a gently undulating gravelly country on which a good cart road could easily be made. At 9-J- miles, the village of Sarbandan ; of 50 houses. Stage 3. —Sarbandan to Demavend Village. (14 miles). (or alternatively to Giliard, 15 miles). The road lies through a level' open plain ; at 5 miles is the village of Aineh-Varzan. From here, the direct road to Dema vend village ascends a small hill, which is avoided by taking the direct Tehran road via Giliard, and so not going to Demavend. The going is good from Aineh-Varzan to Giliard. At the latter place, two bridges are met with ; the one of stone is firm but the one of wood is broken and needs repairing. Near these bridges also, flood water had inundated the road and made it tempora rily impassable for cars or carts, which in any case would be unable to cross the wooden bridge. The road direct to Demavend leaves the direct Giliard road at a point 1(&gt;| miles from Sarbandan and goes W. N. W. to the prosperous village of Demavend. At 13 miles is a low ridge ; the going is good over this ridge and into the village. Stage 2 — 1. Demavend to Tehran. (41 miles). This stage was done by car ; the following amendments are required to the description in the route book. The u mule track ” said to go direct from Chinar teashop to Giliard and Firuzkuh (see page 350) has now been made into a ear track, and a small acclivity immediately to the East of the tea-shop has been graded to form a zig-zag motor road : it has not however been metalled properly, and will soon be useless for any vehicle. From the top of the ridge, some 400 yards from the tea-shop, to Giliard, there is no natural obstacle to a good road. The surface of the portion 44 Chinar Tea-shop ” to Jajarud was very defective. At one place, some 8 miles from Chinar,24 natural spring has welled up in the centre of the road-way, which was in consequence converted into a sea of soft mud for some 300 yards. Owing to this spring the road will have to be newly aligned here. Navaghil posts exist at Bumahind and Rudahind, and a road- toll house at Jajarud. The up-inclines from the Jajarud bridge in the direction of Tehran are severe, but the surface of the road has lately been adequately cleaned of loose stones. The road itself has also been repaired in places ; nevertheless careful driving is always necessary. Alternative Route.— Note. —This route does not appear to be shown in Routes in Persia Volume II. Prom Dali-Chai ford—Mumaj—Tar Lakes—Demavend— Chinar tea-shop. First portion. Dali-Chai ford to Mumaj or Mamaj. (8 miles). The road follows the valley of the Dali-Chai, the general direction being W. N. W. At | mile from the Dali-Chai ford, a brick kiln is passed; this was said by the local inhabitant? to have been used for baking bricks intended to be used in re vetting the T ehr an - F ir uzkuh road, especially the steep parks between Dali-Chai and Aminabad : it has not been worked since the work was abandoned in 1923. The track winds along the valley, the sides of which are steep ; it leads W. N. W. in a fairly straight line. The path is fit for only very sure-footed mules. In the fertile patches near the river are grown a little wheat and a great deal of lucerne. This latter was being reaped at the time. At 3 miles the river is crossed, as the going on rne other bank, the right or south side, is easier for animals. The stream is swift-flowing, with a stony bottom ; but the ford is not difficult if taken slowly. At 4 miles, recross the-stream. At 5^ miles, the path, wffiicn has by now mounted up the side of the valley some I0Q feet passes beside the district and village of Yahar, which lies some f mile to the north in a valley. Hereabouts are some splendid willows and walnut trees. x-it 8 miles, reach the extensive village of Mumaj ; some 100 families, built on the steep slopes of the valley, and surrounded by trees. Excellent water from the stream—camping ground near it, but the extensive lucerne and wheat fields curtail the camping area. The products of the valley are mostly wheat, . ^ an d lucerne ; there is no fruit except walnuts. The inhabitants were friendly though unused to seeing foreigners.25 Most of the men migrate to other towns in winter; and pursue their trades or tailoring or cobbling, leaving their families to winter in the village. The winter is said to be very severe, and communication with the outer world often completely cut off owing to snow. Trees include willow, walnut, and plane. Second portion. Mumaj to Demavend village, via the Tar lakes. {21 miles). The road from Mumaj starts from the top of the village and skirts a bluff, leading on over the valley, now green and fertile. The actual track is often difficult to distinguish and to traverse : a local guide is necessary.. At mile the track descends to the level of the river ; here is an adundant growdh of lucerne and lentils (’adas), and grass of many kinds ; also wheat, barley, and aider trees. At miles, the village of Deh-Nar; some 40 families, with a tributary of the Dali-Ohai coming in from the North : which is crossed by a craz}?' bridge. At 3 miles, another village, called Havir, of 30 families. The road now leads on up the vallev ; at 5 miles bears a little to the south and then leads up again in a westerly direction, through a broad grassy valley. It still follows the left bank of the Dali-Ohai, now very much smaller. At 8| miles is a feeding stream coming in from the north the ascent now becomes steeper, and the scenery more rugged and barren. The snowclad mountain sides are now not far oih. At 7-|- miles, the track reaches a point opposite the smaller of the tw r o lakes, lying some mile off to the north. To get to it the travellers must walk over stony and uneven ground. The smaller lake has a placid, unruffled, greenish surface, and is said to contain no fish. The approaches to it on the A., E. and W. sides are steep; only the south shores are readily approachable. An inlet appears to feed the north side of the lake, coming from the high snow-clad mountain mass on that side ; there seems to be no outlet for the water. The lake is* about | mile across, perhaps half a mile at its widest part. The larger lake lies further to the West. A climb over steep and stony ground leads the traveller to it. It is of irregular shape, some 1,200 yards across at its widest part; most approach es to it are steep, as it lies in a distinct natural basin, over shadowed by the high peaks to the north. The larger lake is said by the inhabitants to contain large fish and to be very deep. Both lakes are entirely innocent of trees, and little- vegetation surrounds them. They are completely frozen over all the winter ; and their altitude, lying as they do at the summit26 of the Mumaj-Tar pass, must be 7,000 feet, if not more. Even in June, at the time of visiting the lakes, the sides of the larger one were covered with unmelted snow, over which the track sometimes lay. \ After skirting the southern shores of the larger lake, by a steep and difficult path, and after reaching a small summit, the track begins to descend, at first gradually and then on a very steep gradient. Sometimes the peak of Demavend is visible to the W. At 11 miles from the larger lake, cross a streamlet coming in from the north. Immediately after, cross over a mass of dirty snow which has remained unmelted since the winter. Then come to a few huts known as Tar village. The gradients sometimes are 1/3. At 4 miles, a ruined imam-zadeh. At 41 miles the steep descents are over ; the road appears to go into a valley ahead, which leads to a district called Varin : but the path there is extremely dangerous and it is preferable to take the track which leads up to the right, up a valley in which the going is good. After a short and easy climb a summit is reached at 51 miles; thereupon the track descends abruptly into transverse valley, at the south end of which can be seen the few huts known as Varin, and on the north side, a few nomad tents were seen. At 6 miles from the larger lake, after crossing the transverse valley, is a sudden ascent over a zig-zag path, causing a great strain on man and beast; the ascents being almost precipitous. When the top is reached a descent on the west side into another valley is begun ; these descents being similar to the ascents already made. After crossing a small stream the road leads up a stony deserted valley for a dreary two miles ; after a gradual ascent, at 9 miles from the larger lake the traveller finally emerges at the top of a small incline on to an open space from which a view of the country surrounding Demavend village can be seen. The village itself is hidden by the crumpled moun tains and valleys to the south-west. The road which must be taken, however, makes a detour, going in a large sweep round, first leading to the north west and then gradually coming round towards the south. At 11 miles, after a wearisome journey down a most tiring series of stony descents reach the village of Dasht-i-Mazar, a fertile district of 50 families, with many quince trees, and wheat and barley fields. At 13 miles from the larger lake, enter Demavend village after traversing cherry groves and vineyards. The Firuzkuh Route.I ■1 27 General Remarks. „ The Photograph, No. 15 facing page 422, given in Fortescue’s Military Report gives some idea of the state of the better parts of the Shirgah-Gaduq portions of the Firuzkuh route. * The worst parts of the route are as follows : 1. Parts of the road which follows the sides of the vallev between Aliabad and Shirgah. 7 2. Almost all of stage 8, except the first mile. Gradients are steep at many places m the gorge, sometimes 1/5, and the side of the road would have to be blasted away in many stretches to make a road for carts. The huge stones in the roadway would have to be broken up and to make satisfactory metal of them would be a difficult task. 3. The same applies to Stage 7, though not to the same extent; i.e., the gradients are easier. 4. In Stage 6, gradients are occasionally 1/5 ; the road also runs on a narrow three feet ledge in many places, and needs re-cutting. The most difficult part is the gorge mentioned. To blast out a decent road would be a large operation. From here to the top of the pass the road is a mere track which needs complete re-alignment. 5. After the good going on the Tehran side of the pass, the principal difficulties are: Namrud to the top of the small crest 2| miles from Namrud ; then the down slopes at from 9 1 to 10 miles, and from there on to the Dali-Chai ford, where the existing unfinished cuts could be utilised. Thence, the difficult narts are the Dali-Chai side of the pass in Stage 4 ; and in Stage 3 the Giliard bridge and the last 500 yards down to the Chinar tea- shop. As for water travellers need have no fear, as streams are frequent throughout the route. Supplies are approximately as mentioned by Fortescue in Routes in Persia Vol. II page 344 ; the whole of that report is indeed invaluable, and the present report should be read in conjuction with it. The stretch from Aliabad to Barfurush was not performed bv the writer personally, except the last two miles of it when he went from Barfurush to Kia-Kulah. Its distance is given as miles and the general state of the road is strictly analogous to the road from Barfurush to Sari.
