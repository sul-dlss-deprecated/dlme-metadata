Confidential , Becord of a d isc ussion held at the India Offioe o n 8th June, 1954 * A discussion took place at the India Office on 8th June with representatives of the Kuwait Oil Company. present Sir Louis Kershaw (in the Chair) Mr. J.G.Laithwaite ) Mr. G-.S.Cr onib i e ) India Off ice. Mr. Stevens. lir, Fraser Mr. Lefroy. ) Kuwait Oil Company. \ ) Sir Louis Kershaw said that the political aspect of the Koweit negotiations was now disposed of, since the two outstanding political questions in whioh His Majesty 1 s Government were interested, namely, the question of the political clauses in the commercial agreement and the question of the Chiel Local Representative had now 'been satisfactorily settled. Mr. Fraser said that the commercial aspect of the negotiations was not so satisfactory. The Company had received from their negotiators in Koweit a copy of a revised concession (Draft Bo. 4) which the Sheikh was willing to sign 'but which included some proposals to which the Company could not agree. Mr. Fraser read out a telegram which they had just received from their negotiators (confirming the ji m fzs information given in Bushxre telegram No. of 7th June) to the effect that the Sheikh said that unless the Company accepted Draft No. 4 j^n toto he would not he prepared to discuss the matter further with them at present and that their negotiators should be withdrawn from Koweit until the end/end of September. Meanwhile the Sheikh would undertake not to discuss a concession with any other Company. The reasons given by .the Sheikh for this attitude were (l) tne appro a on ox uixe not weather at Koweitj (E) pressing business which needed his attention and which was being held up by the oil negotiations; and (S) that the outstanding points could only be settled if the Company's negotiators talked to their principals personally in London ana explained the Sheikh's attitude to them. lie was noir satisfied that it had been made clear. 'Tne Company felt that it was difficult to oppose the Sheikh f s wishes. Sir Louis Kershaw enquired what were the points outstanding betweGn the Sheikh and tho Company, Mr. Eraser and Mr. Stevens agreed that the financial w - points had been virtu ally settl ed. In the revised draft Oi. the concession the Sheikh had, however, altered the basis of the payment of royalty so that instead of being paid only 011 oil QAported from Koweit it would be paid on all oil saved '. Mr. Praser said that this would mean an increase of about 15 to SO'-o in the value of the royalties. A more imp ortant difficulty was that the Sheikh insisted on having a representative in London at a salary of not less ' '''' '' n mmni iwnni minim wW' than £1800 a year (to be paid by the Company) for a period ox 12 yearns, on the expiry of which he would be replaced by a director representing the Sheikh. This demand of the Sheikh was most objectionable. Sir ij o uis Kersnaw asked whether the Company knew what made this point so important to the Sheikh, and what particular intention he had in insisting on it at this stage? Mr. /3. Mr. Fraser said that from the Sheikh's omx point of Tiew he did not see what reason he couid have for his insistence. The Company could not give any definite reason for the difficulty which had arisen though they had certain suspicions, \ Sir Louis Kershaw then read out Bushire telegram I No.650 of 7th June giving the position as it appeared to '' ' t ufa: .vA»t'w' • • Wi' the Political Agent at Koweit and the Political Resident. Was it possible that the Resident had hit the right nail on the head? Mr, Stevens said that although he disliked having to say it he must admit frankly that for some time W ' llll , l . l |,j l ^w l . I, 'Tlf -•-'••-• ■ ' ! , ■ !!!,,,juditf, ^ they had found it difficult not to entertain suspicions of a somewhat similar kind. For example, their ——— r»i negotiators, without the consent of the Company, had presented a new draft concession to the Sheikh embodying proposals which the Company did not approve and providing for the appointment 'by the Sheikh on quite unacceptable terms of a representative in London, Asked who the Sheikh had in mind for this lucrative post, and whether it would not be well to provide that its incumbent should be a Koweiti, the negotiators had first sent an obscure reply, and on being pressed had intimated that the Sheikh had issued his ultimatum. It was also relevant that their negotiators had originally said that it was the political situation which was holding up negotiations and that it would be better for them to withdraw from Koweit for the present. The Company, after consultation with His Majesty's Government, had told them to keep out of the political situation and not to leave Koweit. thereupon they had received this latest telegram from Kowe it/Kovreit, which almost Goemed to confirm their suspicions, informing them that the Slisilch himself said that their negotiators must go. Mr. Stevens said that Major Holmes had apparently established himself in 'file Sheikh's good graces and he had constantly asserted that the Sheikh wanted the concession to be negotiated by him (Major Holmes) and to let him (Major Holmes) get something out of it. All this looked extremely shady, yet apparently Mr. Chisholm, their other negotiator, had concurred in the terns of the latest telegram from ICoweit and in the reading of the Sheikh's attitude which it gave. He added that he had heard for the first time from Mr. Eraser only a few days ago that His Majesty's Government saw any objection to Major Holmes. Sir L ou is Kershaw suggested that in these circumstances the Company were faced with two alternatives: either the Company's principals should go out to Koweit themselves, or they should at once recall Major Holmes. Mi', i'raser said that quite apart from what Mr.Stevens had said he himself had for some time been inclined to doubt Major Holmes, in view of his previous activities in Bahrein, but that when Mr. Stevens sug ested him as one of their negotiators in Koweit and seemed to have confidence in him, believing, as he (Mr. Praser) himself did to a certain extent, that he had influence with the Sheikh, he had not felt that he could reasonably object to his appointment. Mr. Fraser agreed that the Company were faced with the alternatives suggested. Sir Louis Kershaw , asked for his advice, said he felt it would be a mistake to recall their negotiators after so much discussion and when there are so few points oustanding, and he did not at all like the idea of a postponement until the end of September. Mr/o ♦ Mr, Laithvmite suggested that if trie Company's principals went out to Koweit they could relieve both negotiators without loss of face, hut Mr v ffraser thought that if the principals went out, Major Holmes eta. would know that they were suspected of not having handled the situation to the Company 1 s satisfaction. Mi'. Stevens asked whether the Political Agent could not make tactful enquiries of the Sheikh in respect of his real wishes whether the negotiations should 'be continued or not, but Mr. Laithwaite explained that His Majesty's Government had hitherto stood aside from the commercial part of the negotiations, the Company keeping them in touch, and that if the Political Agent were now to start making enquiries as suggested by Mr.Stevens, there might he considerable difficulties with the Sheikh since he might think that iHis Majesty's Government and the Company were c o1lab orati ng. Sir Louis Kersha w said that if negotiations were postponed until September the Company might be faced with an entirely new set of deznancfe from t he Sheikh. Mr. Stevens emphasised again that they were faced with a telegram which purported to give the views of both negotiators. How then could the Company -justify sending out their principals against their negotiators 1 advice? Sir Louis Kershaw did not attach importance to the fact that the advice seemed to come from both negotiators. Major Holmes might have had previous consultation with the Sheikh before the Sheikh's last interview with Mr.Chishe1m and himself. Mr.Fraser said that the Sheikh and Major Holmes were apparently on good terms personally and it almost seemed/©&gt; 6. seemed as if in insisting on the appointment of a Director In London the Sheikh was trying to do a good turn to a friend. Sir Louis Kershaw said it seemed quite wrong that one O j . the Company's negotiators snouXd stand to receive sows financial consideration from the Sheikh out of the negotiations. Mr * Stevens and Mr^ Fraser agreed, ^ve ns tnen enquired tiie nature ox the arrangement which had heen finally reached with the Sheikh in respect of the Chief Local Bepresentative. Mr, i^aithv/aite explained that in substance it was that the provisions on this point of the political agreement should 'be embodied in the Commercial Agreement. We had of course made it clear that we would give full weight to the Sheikh 1 s wishes in connection with any appointment. ihe Company 1 a representatives agreed to consider ui^eavlj the question of sending out the Company's principals to JCoweit. They undertook to inform the India Office as soon as tney had reached a decision and not to recall Major Holmes and Mr. Chisholm without consulting the India Office again. If the decision was in favour of despatching the principals, no previous warning would be given to the negotiators, ./ho uOuld oe informed by telegram that the principals were leaving.2732 (X a*.

The negotiators strongly urged m these circumstance^that unless the Company was prepared to accede to the Sheikh's demands in full they should at once be withdrawn.

No, 598-S of 1934, dated 28th June, 1934, I have made enquiries as to how the mistake arose, and unfort unately there was some misunderstanding. 2. In February, 1933, Cunningham reported that at a Conference held 'by you in Colonel Loch's house on 9th February, 1933, which was attended by S.N.O.P.G. and also Squadron Leader Rowley, he understood you to say that you were arranging to hand over gradually as much as possible of the Bahrein problems to Col.Loch and as evidence of this you handed him a letter (copy attached - &gt; f Appendix 'A'), which dealt with policy and would entail reference to the Sheikh of Bahrein. 3. As a result of Cunningham's report, I wrote you a letter No,2902/31, dated 6th April, 1933 (copy attached - appendix 'B') , and all my 14» /staff Hon'ble Lt.Col.

Apparently, however, no reply to your V ,U 1 letter of the 6th April 1933 can be traced, and I should be obliged if I may have an answer. 5.

Sir, MUEARRAQ, Aerodrome. &lt;/ r I have the honour to refer to your letter No. 78-s of 24/1/33, I agree generally to your proposal that negotiations for the use of MUHARRAQ Aerodrome by Service aircraft should be postponed until the Imperial Airways' agreement has been settled. 2. At the same time you perhaps are not aware that we have certain responsibilities for the reinforce ment of INDIA from this Command. In fact, the Air Ministry has ordered that a practice reinforcement with aircraft from this Command to INDIA is to take place during the current year. Although I do not anticipate that this flight will take place within the next three months, I wish to have all arrangements for it complete. 3. A further point which I have not previously brought to your notice is that I might require, under some circumstances, to send heavy aircraft of the Victoria type down the PERSIAN GULF or beyond. I feel that in such an event I would not be justified in risking damage by order ing the use of MANAMA and I would be compelled to instruct the aircraft to land at MUHARRAQ, whether an agreement for the use of this aerodrome was in existence or not. 4. I imagine that, in view of the friendly atti tude of BAHREIN towards the British Government, there would be no difficulty in obtaining permission for service aircraft to laud at MUHARRAQ, before an agreement is actually drawn up; but I would like confirmation from you on this point. I would naturally inform you at the earliest possible moment of my intention of sending land- planes down the Gulf. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your obedient Servant, l! i ! I (sgd) C.S. Burnett.

Note of a conversation between Colonel Fowle and His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad, Ruler of Kuwait, on 18th July, 1934 at which Major Watts, Political Agent, Kuwait, was present, on the subject of Shuwaikh area lease♦ With regard to the Shaikhs contention that while Bahrain was getting a £.120 per annum frcm the Royal Air Force in addition to what they received under the Civil Air Agreement, he - the Shaikh - was only receiving the rent provided for by the Civil Air Agreement, I took the following liner s' As Major Watts had already pointed out to the Shaikh, there were 2 n concessions w in Bahrain: 1. The Civil aerodrome in Muharraq covered by the Civil Air Agreement; 2. The Royal Air Force aerodrome and Royal Air Force base in Manamah for which the £.120 was paid. Likewise there were in Kuwait 2 'concessions': 1. The Civil Aerodrome covered by the Civil Air Agreement; 2. The R.A.F. option on the Shuwaikh area for which £.120 per annum rent would be paid. The Shaikh therefore was on all fours with the Shaikh of Bahraih, in fact better off since in the case of Kuwait £.120 was being paid only for an option while in Bahrain it was being paid for actual use and possession. 3. The Shaikh seemed to see the force of these simple arguments and expressed himself satisfied with the arrangements. It now remains for the Political Agent, Kuwait, under the orders of Colonel Loch, by an exchange of letters with the Shaikh, to obtain the formal option of the Shuwaikh area for a period of 2 years at a rentalrental of £.120 per annum and also to obtain the formal agreement of the Shaikh to rent this area for £.1200 per annum at any time it may be required up to the expiry of the 2 years option. 4. It should be noted, of course, that under this agreement, if at the end of the 2 years option, His Majesty^ Government are not prepared to rent the area in question, and the Shaikh is not willing to extend the option, the latter will be lost. c • Lt. -Colonel..1 - ■ -yrgiKir*^- ,15^'-' ■ .'an m— i ni m C0NFID3KTIAL.

KUWAIT MP QATAR OIL , When travelling from Bushire to Kuwait the other day, I haa a long conversation with Haji Williamson of the A*P.O.C. Being a Moslem, and, unlilce most 'converts', being trusted by his fellow MDhammedans, he is in a position to gauge local Moslem opinion fairly correctly• I was careful to avoid expressing my own opinion ana let him talk, which he was quite willing to do. 2. On the subject of Kuwaiti Oil he was definitely of opinion that Major Holmes was the nigger in the wood pile, and for his own ends had assisted the Sheikh to stick out for high terms from the K.O»G. He said that the Sheikh would never have adopted such a stiff attitude towards the Company unless he had been instigated thereto by Major Holmes. ^♦ U&amp;tar Oil » He, Haji Williamson^ had gone to Qatar with Mr. Mylles of the A.P.O.G. on his recent visit to the Sheikh, and on the whole was rather favourably impressed with the Sheikh's attitude, which had improved since the last visit of the a« P »0» C 9 representatives last year. He thought that the policy of leaving the sheikh alone, and so giving the impression that the Company were not running after him to get the concession, had been successful. He was under the impression that there were some hopes, though, of course, he could not commit himself in any way definitely, that at the end of the new option period/period, the sheikh might he willing to abate his terms. He said that he had heard indirectly that Ibn Baud's stock ho.a somewhat gone down with the Sheikh, as a consequence of the evacuation of Hoaeida and the Yemen Littoral without apparently payment of any subsidy on the part of the Lmaiii. The sheikh of Kuwait, in the course of casual conversation with me a day or two later, also expressed the opinion that the final result of the Saudi-Yemeni war was not regarded by the Arabs of the Gulf as by any means too successful from ibn Saud's point of view.

After Compliiiients. Your Excellency will no doubt remember that Lt.-Col. Dickson had an interview with you on 16th June last just before he left for England. E. Amongst other matters which were then discussed was the question of Your Excellency giving permission for the R.A,F. to lay down mooring buoys in the vicinity of the old Naval Pier situated in the Shuwaikh Harbour anchorage for the use of their Flying Boats when these visited Kuwait. I understand that Your Excellency was good enough to agree to the laying down of the buoys in that area subject to the followingconditions: (i) Kuwait sailing craft at all times to be allowed full use of the whole of Shuwaikh Harbour, there being no question of the R.A.F. denying them access to the harbour, or any part of it. (ii) That if possible the mooring buoys should be placed at the westerly and of the harbour so as to be interfered with as little as possible by sailing craft entering or leaving the harboui. (iii)That the R.A.F. Officer told off to lay the moorings should work in cooperation and in company with one of Your Excellency's officials when selecting the actual site for the mooring buoys in question, as the latter could point out dhow anchorages and assist generally, and misunderstandings would be avoided. 4. I am directed to ask Your Excellency to formally confirm this agreement. Usual Ending. Sd.

That heing so, you 1 can inform the Resident that we will he prepared to pay £120 per annum for reservation of the quarantine site on the terms previously agreed between ua in correspondence ending * vith my letter S#31084of J&amp;th April,1954. 2-^ As far as paragraphs 4-6 oi Colonel Dickson's letter and paragraphs 2-4 of Colonel Fowle 1 s letter are concerned, the latter explains-, very clearly the di :ferenee between the position at Bahrain and Koweit. , ft 4. Koweit is obviously much more likely to require E*A # F. assistance than Bahrain and has, in fact, been given such assistance on more than one occasion, and, therefore, it was quite as much in the interest of the Sheikh of Koweit himself as of the H.A.F. that our landing ground was established in his territory. 5. Moreover, there is a further consideration which hae not been mentioned by uhe Resident and that is, that the civil base at Bahrain is much more important than the civil landing ground at Koweit* Koweit will provide lees traffic than Bahrain and o in^ to its proximity to Basrah will probably be ueed much less than the latter place. Chat being so a smaller au.i will be collected at Koweit in respect of landing fees than at Bahrain, but nevertheless the Sheikh Of the former place is being paid, the same amount in respect Of the civil air agreement as the Sheikhs of Bahrain and Gwadur. We certainly do not consider the Sheikh has any grievance and agree, as suggested by Colonel Pwole, that full use might be made by the Political Agent of these arguments when an opportunity presents itself. t ^ &gt; ^ , £ W 6» If, as suggested by Colonel Fowle, in paragraph 5 of despatch, the Sheikh proposes charging duty on E#A«F» fuel, we agree that the oasewill have to ba dealt with on its merits, but we regard it as important that the Air Ministry raite ,BBq # , should/ 0m &amp;ehall, ^7^^ (tz-P. ^ S*W#1» fyx. ^should have a further opportunity 01' considering tlx© matter when the Sheikh has shown his hand. As far as fuel required for aircraft passin- through Koweit on passage up and down the Gulf is conoorned, this duty would probably oe quite neg^gible, hut it might be pointed out to the Sheikh that he would, in any case, hardly be justified in charging duty on fuel in respect of flights of an operational character which mi^ht be undertaken in his own interests. 7. There is another aspect, however, in connection with this question of duty which I would like 10 bring to your notice. In thz event o our eventually establishing a B .A.F.base at ICoweit the sum involved in .ptiymenu 0 duty on fuel night be quite cons icier able and it is possible the Sheilc^ xaight also wish to charge duty on other classes of K.A#F» stores, the bill for which would, no doubt, be considerable, That being so, it is obviously desirable to avoid establishini any precedent in the matter of payment of duty on K.iuF .fuel at this stage if at all possible.

From Secretary of State for India, London. To Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, at Kuwait, No. 2207. Repeated Government of India, Simla, No. 2208. Dated 18th received 21st September 1934. Please see Dickson's Express Letter dated 31st May last C-203 and connected correspondence. Appointment of Chief Local Representative of the Kuwait Oil Company. 2. Company fear that Shaikh has not receded from the proposal made to their negotiators that commercial agreement should provide for selection of Chief Local Representative by Shaikh. They are anxious that any difficulties on this score should be cleared up before their negotiators arrive back at Kuwait ( as they expect to do in the near future but not before the end of next week ). As this matter is mainly political I think it desirable that it should not be dealt with by the representatives of the Company. 3. I have consulted Fowle and, unless you see strong objection, should be glad if Watts could address a letter to the Shaikh in the following sense. Letter should refer to article No. 4 of the political agreement and remind Shaikh that, as he himself pointed out in his conversation with , Dickson on May 31st, he has officially approved of the contents * of that agreement in his letter of April 13th. The question of the method of appointing the Chief Local Representative is therefore really settled. His Majesty's Government, however, as has already been explained to the Shaikh, would give the fullest consideration to his yxbxs. wishes in approving of any appointment. In order to make it quite clear that in the appointment of a Chief Local Representative the wishes of the shall . Shaikh KXi± not be disregarded, they have now authorised the . Political Agent to give a written assurance that they will ' 1 not■I-W lot approve of any appointment to the post of Chief Local Representative referred to in their agreement with the Company signed on March 5th 1934 without first consulting the Shaikh, and that they will naturally give great weight to his wishes. The matter having been dealt with in the Government agreement, which the Shaikh has approved, and in this supplementary assurance there is, therefore, no need in the negotiations between the Shaikh and the Company for any further discussion of the question of the method of aqajaeLXKiiHg approving the appointment. Here letter would end. 4. For your own and Watts' information 1 may state that the foregoing proposal has the full concurrence of the Company and it will be unnecessary that the commercial agreement should include any provision regarding the question except a clause providing, for example, that tl the Company shall from time to time designate its General Manager or one of its other principal employes in Kuwait as its Chief Local Representative to represent it in matters relating to the agreement.' \ I understand that the Company, on resumption of their negot- -iations, will propose such a clause. If the Shaikh should then raise any difficulties in connection with the difference between the commercial agreement and article 4 of the Government agreement read with the above assurance. Watts should report on ] his attitude and I will send further instructions. So far f as I can see at present, in such an event it would meet the case to remind him that in accordance with the correspondence ' enclosed with Dickson^s letter of 6th June, C-209, the commercial agreement is subordinate to the Government agreement in case of inconsistency, and to assure him that in regard to the appointment of Chief Local Representative it will be subordinate also to the assurance given in paragraph No* 3 above.

I have snown your letter to Colonel Powle ana nave discussed the matter with him. I enclose in this connection a note of a conversation he had with the .Sheikh of Koweit on nis way home. 2&gt; The jSesident thinks that we might try to get the sheikh to agree to rent us tne Bunder shweikh site for, say, live years at £120 a year on the understanding that thereafter (or at an earlier stage if we started to make active use of and to exercise our option over it) we shoula pay him at the rate of £1200 a year. He does not think that there is any real prospect of our doing better than this ana is not too confiaent that we shall persuade the Sheikh to go so far. would you let me know whether you agree and we will then telegraph to the Acting flesioent?

Two years is too short a period to he of practical value and an option for 5 years, even If it were ohtalnable, is considered unlikely to meet the requirements of the Air Ministry. 2. Hie Council woula, however, be grateful if the i 'olitical Resident could be requested to ask the Sheikh of Koweit to inform him before disposing of the land to other interests in order that they may have a further opportunity j of making an offer for the land should it then be required. 3. with regard to paragraph 3 of Mr. Laithwaite's letter, the Council concur in the arrangements for Flying Boats aiscussed in the Political Resident's letter to the Air Officer Comnanding, Iraq, No.596-3 of 28th June 1934, and the Air Officer Commanding is now awaiting the sheikh's formal sanction before taking action to lay down the naorln^ 4.

The draft Concession seems to be unobjectionable from our point of view, but before informing the Company in this sense we should be grateful if you coula let uc know whether the Petroleum Department see any objection to the insertion of the word 'crude' before 'petroleum' in Article 1 or to the new Article 20 about measurement, or whether you have any other comments to make on the new draft. ^ You will see that the draft for the first time gives the sheikh the right to appoint a Representative in Lonaon, and lays down that the Representative shall be/ Starling, Esq., Petroleum Department, Mines Department, Dean Stanley street, S.W. 1.'be of Koweita, British, or .American nationality. We have for practical purposes acciuiesced in the appointment of a London representative if the Koweit Oil Company are prepared to agree to it, in the informal discussions that have taken place with the Company; but the question of nationality now comes up for the first time. It would of course be definitely preferable on general political grounds that the Representative should be a British or a Koweiti subject. But we are on the whole inclined not to raise the point. It might well be difficult to persuade the Company to meet us over it: and having regard to the very restricted nature of the duties which the London representative, if appointed, will perform, to the fact tnat tney will be in connection with the safeguarding of the Sheitm's interests in commercial matters, and to the provision which has been made in the Political Agreement for canalising the disposal of all political questions which may arise locally through the Political Agent, we think any risk: involved can safely be taken. 3.

I think it is worth while to place on record the following facts, which have some bearing on the position of Puad Bey Hamza in r egard to this business. Puad Bey has long been intimate with Husein Awaini, who is hand in glove with Mr .Ydlibi, the promoter of the Arabian Development Syndicate and who acts for Ydlibi and the Syndicate m Jedda. It is very commonly thought, though I have no proof of this, that Puad Bey is interested in Awaini' £ commercial enterprises. Awaini arrived in London from Paris with Puad Bey and his wife on September 18th and left with them on the S6th. He was their only other guest besides Sheyich Hafiz Wahba and myself when I lunched with them at the Savoy# The Puads went to Manchester during the week-end September 21st to 23rd and made no secret of the fact that they had gone there at the instance of Ydlibi, When they left on the 26th for Paris, the very small seeing-off party included Ydlibi and his wife (an Englishwoman)# There has been no secrecy whatsoever about these intimacies and it would not be repugnant to the standards of Arabia for i'uad Bey to have some commercial interest iifs business in which he was concerned officially, so long as he t let the King down» it is not far—fetched to assume that he has personal motives for backing Ydlibi's candidature for/for the Neutral Zone concessioiif though he is intelligent enough to realize that the option secured by the Standard Oil Company of California is an awkward obstacle. His olan may well be as follows, though this is of course a surmise;— (a) To promote an agreement between Ydlib^s Syndicate and the bheyiih of Koweit, so as to create one of the two situations contemplated in the option,i.e. the situation in which Standard Oil can be asked to exercise their option after Ibn baud and the Sheykh have both shown readiness to give the concession to the Syndicate. Then (b) If Standard Oil say they are ready to take up the concession on the same terms, to put pressure on them, either to withdraw on the ground that matters have come to a dead lock, which cannot have been the intention of the original agreement with Standard Oil, or to combine with the Syndicate, in order to provide a way out of the deadlock.

Copies of this letter and of the Shaikh's reply are enclosed, 2. As this reply was altogether unsatisfactory, I went and saw the Shaikh this morning. His 'Excellency who looked particularly glum directly the expression 'Chief Local Representative* was mentioned, declared the matter had never been really settled, that it stood where it was when the point had been raised in April in discussions with Colonel Dickson and that he claimed he should be given the right of choosing the Chief Local Representative subject to the final approval of His Majesty's Government. I pointed out that the matter had not been discussed fur ther as it was considered that as a result of His Excellency giving his approval in writing to the Political Agreement concluded between His Majesty's G -ovemment and the Company, the question of the method of appointment of the Chief Local Representative had, under the terms of p a-'a 4 of that agreement, automatically been settled. The Shaikh tacitly admitted that this statement expressed the situation correctly as he replied that under these cir cumstances he would, in the coming negotiations with bhe4./ with the Company's representatives, avoid all discussion of this subject and that if and when the concession ?/as granted to them he would come to some proper understanding with His Majesty's Government in the matter, I then asked him to explain what this understanding would be and the Shaikh once more declared he would make some arrangement with the Company whereby he would nominate the Chief Local Representative and submit the individual's name for the final approval of His Majesty's Government. i pointed out that the Company could not enter into any such arrange ment in view of the Political Agreement entered into by them and reminded the Shaikh once more that he had approved of that agreement and that the only interpretation that could be put on Clause 4 was that the final approval of the Chief Local Representative had to remain in the hands of His Majesty's Government, ^ 5, I went on to explain in the terms of para 5 of Secretary of State's telegram referred to above, that in order to avoid any possible misunderstanding in the future on this point His Majesty's Government had wished me to approach His ISxcellency and point out that the question of the final appointment of Chief Local Represen tative had by reason of the Shaikh's acceptance of the Political Agreement been left in the hands of His Majesty's Government but that they wished at the same time to assure him that they would not approve of any appointment to the post without first consulting him and would give great weight to his wishes. His Excellency's reply was that until he had actually given the concession he preferred not to discuss the matter as it was quite possible that the Kuwait Oil Company would not accept his terms and in that case he would not give them or any other Company the concession. Under these circumstances the Shaikh declared he saw no use at this stage in discussing the point about the method of appointing a Chief Local Representative.3 4:» I sQ-iQ- 't qs. u 'ttiG only c. © si i*g o? His MfijGstjy* s Government in this matter of the Chief Local Representative which was a political and not a commercial one, was to clear up a possible misunderstanding in the future in the interests of the Shaikh and themselves• Shaikh then replied that as negotiations were about to be resumed in a few days in Kuwait, he would prefer not to go on with this particular question of the Chief Local Representative just now, that he would not discuss it at all with the Company 's representatives but that if eventually he did give the concession to the Kuwait Oil Company he would then write in to the Political Agent and formally agree that the method of appointment of the Chief Local Representative should be as mentioned in i *i-\ my letter to him of October 4th.' x—t ' 5. The Shaikh's whole attitude - particularly at this interview - on the question of the appointment of a Chief Local Representative affords, I consider, good grounds for believing that he has made certain promises to some unknown person or persons at whose identity, however, it is not difficult to make a guess i.e. Major Holmes and/or confederates 6, Just before leaving I casually remarked that as His Excellency did no win effect agree with the attitude of His Majesty's Government as regards the method of appointment matter once and for all if he would reply accordingly to my letter in substitution of his last received. His Excellency declared, however, that he gave his word of honour that once the concession was given he would act as he had already promised and that nothing further was therefore now needed. 7.

S, Your Jbcoellency will remember that in your letter ' NO .R4/1530, dated the 13th April 1934, you had officially approved of the contents of that agreement. The question of the method of appointing the Chief Local Representative is therefore really settled. As had already been explained to Your Excellency His Majesty's G-overnment would however give the fullest consideration to Your Excellency's wishes in approving of any appointment. 3. In order to make it quite clear that in the appointr ment of a Chief Local Representative the wishes of Your Excellency shall not be disregarded His Majesty's G-overnment have now authorized me to give Your Excellency a written assurance that they will not approve of any appointment to the post of Chief Local Representative referred to in their agree- ~ ment with the Company signed on March 5th 19 34 without first P consulting Your Excellency and that they will naturally give [&amp;'•■■■ great weight to Your Excellency's wishes.

CONFIDENTIAL. Section 3. [E 6018/4/25] No. 1. Sixth and Seventh Meetings with Fuad Bey Hamza, held at the Foreign Office on September 25, 1934. (Koweit Neutral Zone Oil Concession.) THE sixth meeting began at 12 noon. The following were present;—- Mr. Rendel. _ . . „ _ . . . , Fuad Bey Hamza (Deputy Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Anairs). Sheikh Hafiz Wahba (Saudi Arabian Minister in London). Sir A. Ryan. Mr. Laithwaite (India Office). Mr. Johnstone. The subiect for discussion was the proposed oil concession in the I^ owelt Neutral Zone—an area between Saudi Arabia and Koweit, over which, under the Frontier Convention of the 2nd December, 1922, King Ibn baud and the Sheikh of Koweit have equal rights. Mr. Rendel asked Fuad Bey to explain the position and the views of the Saudi Government on this question. Fuad Bey stated that he had little to add to what he had already said to Sir A Ryan The Saudi Government were naturally anxious that the oil m this area should be profitably exploited. They had been approached by a British group (represented by Mr. Ydlibi of Manchester, acting on behalf of the Arabian Development Syndicate) in connexion with the Saudi interest m this concession Unfortunately/ the hands of the Saudi Government were tied by the option() which, as His Maiesty's Government were aware, they had already given to the Standard Oil Company of California, in respect of the neutral zone, when granting; that company their concession over the Hasa Coast ^ 18 0 p provided, inter alia, that, if the Sheikh of Koweit should agree for his part to the grant of the neutral zone concession to some other party on any specitied terms, the Standard Oil Company of California would be entitled to offer to take up b e concession, in so far as the Saudi share in it was concerned, on t e same (oi better) terms, in which case the Saudi Government would be obliged to accept their candidature. Fuad Bey was reminded that there was no question of Saudi or Koweiti ' shares '' in this concession—a phrase which he had once or twice used. No part of the concession could be separately granted by either of the rulers concerned, but the concession could only be granted jointly by both rulers. Fuad Bey agreed, and admitted that the Saudi Government were not free to dispose of the concession or any part of it, except in agreement with the She v of Koweit. At the same time they were committed, m so far as their own rights were concerned, to the Standard Oil Company, to the extent of e op ion. ey were therefore anxious to reach some agreement with His Majesty s Governmen and the Sheikh of Koweit as to the best course of action to be pursued. Mr. Rendel pointed out that the question, which was already sufficiently difficult, had been greatly complicated by the option granted by the baudi Govern ment to the Standard Oil Company of California in advance of any agreem with the Sheikh. The Saudi Government now suggested an agreement with Wis Majesty's Government and the Sheikh about the concession; but such an a g ie ® ment should have preceded the grant of the option. The difficulties ot the situation had now been very greatly increased. (!) See text at Annex a. [206 bb—3] BFuad Bey agreed that this might have been preferable, but the option had in fact been given, and it was no good going back over the past It was a situation of practical fact. The difficulty would disappear if the Sheikh agreed to the prant of the concession to an applicant such as the Arabian development Svndicate, on terms which the Standard Oil Company pioved unwilling to cap, with the result that their option, which they must exercise withm thirty days, would lapse. Failing this, Fuad Bey suggested an effort to promote a combina tion between the Standard Oil of California and British interests, sucti as the Arabian Development Syndicate, as had been done, for instance, m the case of the United States and British interests competing for the Koweit oil concession, so that, agreement having thus been reached between the competitors, the option would no longer matter. Mr. Rendel replied that if the option could be eliminated as a result of some other group putting forward proposals which the Standard Oil C ompany decided not to cap, the situation would, of course, be greatly simplified. It would then presumably be possible for these applicants to put foiward to the ^lieikli of Koweit firm proposals which they would be in a position to implement, and which would, of course, be considered on their merits. But His Ma jesty s Government could 'not possibly tie their hands or those of the Sheikh of Koweit until the complication of the option was out of the way and a firm offer could be made to the Sheikh. ■ IB As regards the suggestion that His Majesty's Government and the baudi Government should endeavour to promote a combination of the Standard Oil Company with British interests, he explained in the first place that His Majesty's Government were not in a position to exercise such influence on any oil companies. The question of possible combinations between the various oil groups was one which only the oil groups themselves could decide, on commercial and economic grounds; but such combinations were often matters of great difficulty, owing to the complicated relations and understandings existing between the various oil groups. Fuad Bey nevertheless considered that the idea of a combination between the groups was the most hopeful line to follow, and he was confident that the Standard Oil could be induced to arrive at some understanding with the British group at present competing with them (i.e., the Arabian Development Syndicate). Mr, Rendel suggested that in that case it was for the Saudi Government to clear up the situation as it affected the two groups so as to make it possible for a firm offer to be made to the Sheikh of Koweit. Fuad Bey enquired as to the Sheikh's attitude towards the matter. Sir A. Ryan said that, so far as he knew, no approach had been made to the Sheikh. Mr. Ydlibi or his agent at Jedda had told Sir A. Ryan at an earlier stage that the syndicate were practically assured of the Sheikh's consent to their proposals, but this appeared to have been an exaggeration, due perhaps to Mr. Ydlibi's optimism. Mr. Laithwaite confirmed Sir A. Eyan's belief that no one had so far approached the Sheikh of Koweit. Mr. Ydlibi and Mr. Janson, of the Arabian Development Syndicate, had wished to approach him. They had claimed that they were already assured of the concession as far as the Saudi rights in it were concerned, and that the Standard Oil Company of California were definitely out of the running. Subsequent enquiries had shown that these statements were incorrect, and they had recently been told that they should clear up the position with the Saudi Government before proceeding further as regards the Sheikh. Fuad Bey admitted that there had been a misunderstanding on the part of his Government during his absence in Asir as to the effect of the option. He had cleared this up on his return with Sir A. Ryan. The position was that his Government were willing to grant the concession, so far as their rights were •concerned, to the Arabian Development Syndicate, but could not do so definitely unless the Sheikh of Koweit were also willing to give it to the syndicate, and the Standard Oil Company of California then refused to take the concession up on the same terms. It was for this reason that he suggested a combination between the two groups under the auspices of His Majesty's Government and the Saudi Government.I 3 u4 In the course of further discussion, Sir A. Ryan emphasized the consideration that His Majesty's Government could not commit themselves to the position that only the two groups which had been mentioned should be considered. The - discovery of oil in commercial quantities at Bahrein had stimulated widespread I interest in potential oil-fields elsewhere in Arabia and it might well be that other . parties, independent both of Standard Oil and the Arabian Development Syndicate, might wish to apply to the Sheikh of Koweit. Mr. Laithwaite endorsed this and pointed out that His Majesty's Govern ment could not undertake to compel the Sheikh to accept one or other of the two groups mentioned as a combination of both. Mr. Rendel reaffirmed the view that in any case, as regards the two groups in question, it was for the Saudi Government to clear up the position. Other candidates might also come forward and a period of competitive bargaining might ensue. This might cause considerable delay and moreover there were other questions to be considered, such as the necessity for an agreement between Governments regarding jurisdiction and protection in the area to be conceded. Fuad Bey suggested that there would be advantage in having as many competitors for the concession as possible. Mr. Rendel observed that this was not necessarily the case and cited the example of the proposed concession for Koweit itself. A strong rivalry had ended in an agreement between two competitors, and it might well happen in the h present case that efforts to stimulate competition unduly might similarly defeat : their own object. The further discussion was to some extent repetition, and rather involved. It turned largely on {a) Fuad Bey's efforts to elucidate the attitude of His Majesty's Government, who might, he feared, be adverse to the participation of the Standard Oil Company of California, to whom the Saudi Government were committed to the extent of the option, and (h) his efforts to show that a combination of interests would afford the best solution and could be adapted to the desiderata of His Majesty's Government by securing that the parties to the k combine should form a company of British nationality. As regards {a), Mr. Rendel made it clear that His Majesty's Government could not be guided by purely national considerations. They would certainly, in the case of a foreign company, require certain safeguards; but the advantage 1 to be derived by the Sheikh of Koweit from the concession would be a primary - consideration. As regards (&amp;), Fuad Bey suggested that His Majesty's Government and the Saudi Government might at least agree on certain principles and developed his suggestion that the groups now in view might be brought to form jointly a subsidiary British company. He thought that the Saudi Government might find if: means to induce Standard Oil of California to agree to this. Mr. Rendel feared that a combination between a company as powerful as Standard Oil of California and one so comparatively weak in resources as the Arabian Development Syndicate would result in the virtual absorption of the latter by the former. He dwelt also on the difficulty of bringing pressure to bear on oil companies to effect combines, on the delicate nature of the play of interests involved in the creation of subsidiary companies, on the fact that the official nationality of a subsidiary might be illusory, and on the circumstance that any applicant for the concession would be at the mercy of the Standard Oil Company of California, so long as the latter enjoyed its rights under the option. Sir A. Ryan pointed out that in fact the technical nationality of an exploiting company was of small importance, compared with the financial interests in it. Mr. Rendel agreed, and repeated that His Majesty's Government would probably in any case require special safeguards in the case of any company which was not entirely British. He then suggested that, as it was already late, the meeting should' be resumed later in the day. This was agreed to. Before the meeting ended, Sir A. Ryan drew uad Bey's attention to a statement which Mr. Ydlibi or his agent in Jedda had made to Sir A. Ryan personally, that under no circumstances would the Arabian Development [206 bb—3] b 2Syndicate combine with Standard Oil of California. This seemed to him material to what Fuad Bey had been suggesting, although such a statement might not hold for ever. The subject was not pursued, but Fuad Bey intimated in an undertone _ that the combination might be feasible, in spite of what nad been said to Sir A. Ryan. The seventh meeting was held at 6 p.m. on the same day, with the san| attendance. 3Ir. Rendel gave a brief resume of what appeared to be the position. Tuad Bey had suggested that an agreement should De reached between the Saudi Government, His Majesty's Government and the bhiekh of Koweit as to the conditions on which an oil concession should be granted m e Koweit Neutral Zone. But even if this had not been impracticable on othei giounds, the Saudi Government were, in fact, precluded from reaching am definite agreement with the Sheikh of Koweit about the proposed concession since, whatever agreement might be made, the Standard Oil Company of California could always come in under the terms of their option, cap any other otter that might have been made, and oblige the Saudi Government to support their application. The position thus was that no one except the Standard Oil Lompany of California could at present make a really firm offer which they could m fact carry out, since the Standard Oil would always be entitled to a preferential I treatment as regards the Saudi rights, if they wished to claim it. This being so, the only reallv practical agreement which could be reached between the feaudi Government, His Majestv's Government and the Sheikh would be to give a concession to the Standard Oil Company if they were prepared to take it up, or to some combination in which they would be the dominant partner though sucnl a combination seemed unlikely. As Mr. Rendel had already explained, this J was out of the question, as His Majesty's Government and the bheikn t'ouia | not tie their hands, and the Sheikh must be free to deal with any applicant who J might apply. . , • • i • i If the Standard Oil Company of California, or any combination to which they would agree, could put forward a firm proposal to the Sheikh of Koweit, that proposal would be considered on its merits. But there seemed no reason why the Standard Oil Company should wish to take the initiative in putting forward such a proposal, since they were completely safeguarded by the option and could comfortably wait until some other applicant put forward a proposal, when they could decide whether to cap it or not. Fuad Bey enquired whether there were no means of tempting other oil companies to bid for the concession. Mr. Rendel replied that His Majesty's Government had no means of bringing pressure to bear on any oil company in this sense. In the first place, any company making a proposal would know that whatever proposal it made was liable to be capped by the Sandard Oil Company, who would be entitled, under its option, to offer similar or better terms. This would act as a great deterrent to other applicants, and greatly complicate their task in deciding what would be a fair price to offer for the concession. Secondly, he believed that the oil companies were likely to adopt a cautious policy towards this area. Wasteful exploitation of the world's oil resources in the past had now led the oil companies to proceed with great deliberation in the development of new territories. Most of the big oil companies already had large areas to draw on. The Standard Oil of California themselves were already engaged in the exploitation of a much larger area in Hasa, adjacent to the Neutral Zone. They would thus have no particular desire to hasten the exploitation of the Neutral Zone itself, and it might well be to their own best interest to use their option merely to prevent the exploitation of that area by any other group. In the circumstances, it might be very difficult either to get any other company to make a firm offer or to do anything which would have the effect of bringing the Standard Oil Company's option to an end, and it looked very much as though a deadlock might be reached. IliKowiIn reply to an enquiry by Fuad Bey as to whether Mr. Ydlibi could not with advantage make a direct approach to the Sheikh of Koweit, Mr. Laithwaite pointed out that, so long as the option remained in force, Mr. Ydlibi was not in a position to make any firm offer to the Sheikh. It would be necessary for His Majesty's Government to make the situation quite clear to the Sheikh in the event of any approach to him by the syndicate. Sw A. Ryan then put forward the following purely personal and tentative suggestion: The clause embodying the option was so worded as to treat the Neutral Zone as though it were part of a large area which was otherwise Saudi territory, and, indeed, referred to it as the ' so-called ' Neutral Zone, doubtless owing to a slip. Would it not be possible for the Saudi Government to get rid of the option as regards the Neutral Zone by persuading the Standard Oil Company of California to accept in exchange for their rights in the Neutral Zone similar rights in respect of an equivalent tract of territory not at present covered by their concession, but within purely Saudi territory ? Fuad Bey did not seem inclined to pursue this suggestion; but he put forward, again quite personally and unofficially, an alternative suggestion that the Neutral Zone should be bisected, either for purposes of the concession only, in which case the concession in the northern half would be within the gift of the Sheikh of Koweit only, and that for the southern half within the gift of the Saudi Government only, or by a definitive political partition, a new frontier being drawn across the middle of the zone, the northern half being completely incorporated in Koweit and the southern half completely incorporated in Saudi Arabia. Mr. Rendel said that he thought that the first suggestion, i.e., for a partition in respect of the oil rights only, would be open to serious objections, particularly as the questions of jurisdiction, protection, &amp;c., which were in any case likely to lead to difficulty, would remain unsolved. On the other hand, although the matter would obviously have to be very carefully looked into, and he could not express any definite opinion at this stage, the second suggestion seemed to him to offer distinct possibilities. The existence of the Neutral Zone had certainly led to a great deal of difficulty, and if any oil concession were eventually given to a foreign company in it, these difficulties would be by no means at an end, since, as he had indicated at an earlier stage, it would be necessary to consider very carefully the arrangements to be made for protection, jurisdiction, &amp;c. If, however, the zone were to be bisected and the two halves of it were to be organically absorbed into Koweit and Saudi Arabia respectively, many of these questions would no longer arise, and a great deal of difficulty might be avoided. On the other hand, it would be necessary to consider the difficulties very carefully. In the first place, it would be necessary to know the precise reasons for which the zone had been originally created, and to make quite sure that they no longer operated. Moreover, he was under the impression that the Neutral Zone represented approximately the area of migration of the Awazim tribe; and there might well turn out to be insuperable objections to the bisection of an area inhabited by a single nomadic tribe, since this might lead to difficulties over allegiance, administration, taxation, &amp;c. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent, Koweit, happened at present both to be on leave in this country, and Mr. Rendel suggested that they might both be urgently consulted. Mr. Laithwaite undertook to arrange this, and agreed that at first sight Fuad Bey's suggestion looked as though it might be well worth pursuing, if only because it would afford a solution of the very thorny problem of the arrangements to be made for the exercise of jurisdiction and the grant of protection in the Neutral Zone. Fuad Bey explained that he had put forward this suggestion only as a last resort. He would still much prefer that a joint concession should be given, and still hoped that it might be possible for the Arabian Development Syndicate to make proposals either independently or in combination with the Standard Oil Company of California. Mr. Rendel repeated some of the objections which had already been mentioned to this proposal, which in any case seemed likely to prove impracticable, m view of the terms of the Standard Oil Company's option.Eastern Department, Foreign Office, September 26, 1934.

I. In addition to the grant of the exclusive area described in article 2 of this agreement, the Government also hereby grants to the Company a preference right to acquire an oil concession covering the balance of eastern Saudi Arabia extending as far west of the westerly boundary exclusive of the area, as the contact between the sedimentary and igneous formations. This preference right includes such rights as the Government may now have, or may hereafter acquire, in the so-called 'Neutral Zone ' bordering on the Persian Gulf to the south of Koweit, The nature of this preference right is to be hereafter agreed upon. II. The Company's preference right to acquire an oil concession covering the so-called 'Neutral Zone' referred to in article 3 of the Saudi Arabian Concession shall be a right equal to, with regard to rights of the Government in the Neutral Zone, the terms and conditions which may be obtained by the Sheikh of Koweit for a concession covering his rights in the Neutral Zone. In the ] absence of any grant of an oil concession covering such rights of the Sheikh ot Koweit the Government will endeavour to reach a formal agreement with the ( 2 ) The text is given as telegraphed, and must be regarded as subject to slight verbal amendment. As a result of the present discussion, three alternative solutions had been suggested :— J (1) To eliminate the option which had been given to the Standard Oil W Company of California by getting some other company such as the Arabian Development Syndicate, to put forward definite pioposals with a view to bringing the Standard Oil Company into the open, and getting them either to make a higher bid or to abandon their rights. This was really no solution, however, since the Standard Oil CompanM were entitled by their option to bid against any oiter made to and accepted by, the Sheikh of Koweit; so that it would presumably be impossible to eliminate the option by such means m advance of any approach to the Sheikh of Koweit, while any approach to the Sheikh of Koweit, while the option still existed, would be open to the objections already discussed earlier in the meeting. (2) For the Saudi Government to persuade the Standard Oil Company of California to abandon their option over the Neutral Zone m exchange for new rights for an area of equal value elsewhere in Saudi Arabia. (3) To divide the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. Mr Rendel was inclined to think that the last of these suggestions was the only one likely to offer a way out of the existing deadlock; and, although it was understood that His Majesty's Government could not possibly commit themselves on the subiect at this stage, it was agreed that it should be urgently explored in consultation with Colonel Fowle and Colonel Dickson, and that if it was desired to pursue the matter, the Saudi Minister in London should be informed of the result. Meanwhile, Fuad Bey undertook to let His Majesty's Government know as soon as possible'if any other solution of the difficulty occurred to him.7 IvO Sheikh of Koweit whereby the Company will be permitted to acquire an oil concession covering rights'of the Government and the Sheikh of Koweit in the Neutral Zone. In either of these two events the Company shall have a period of thirty days from the date it received written notice setting forth in full the terms and conditions of the oil concession covering the rights of the Sheikh of Koweit in the Neutral Zone, or covering the terms of the proposed concession embracing the rights of the Government and the Sheikh of Koweit in the Neutral Zone as the case may be, within which to decide and to notify the Government whether or not the Company wishes to acquire the oil concession on such terms. If the Company does not wish to do so, the Government is free to negotiate with others, but if the oil concession [ ? is] proposed [ ? to be] granted to others on the same terms as those offered to the Company the preference right of the Company shall continue, at least as long as the provisions of article 7 of the Saudi Arabian Concession remain in force.By Air Mail.

My dear Dickson, In the course discussions with Fuad Hamza about the Koweit Neutral Zone oil concession he reverted to a suggestion which he had previously made in conversation with Sir Andrew Ryan at Jedda, that one solution of the difficulties which had arisen might be the division on a 50/50 basis of the Neutral Zone (at any rate for this purpose) between the Sheikh of Koweit and Ibn Saud. 2» Any such division would, of course, have to be subject to the consent of the Sheikh of Koweit. With a view to further consideration being given here as to its possible advantages and disadvantages we should be grateful if you could let us know: (a) What attitude you would anticipate that the Sheikh of Koweit would take towards such a proposal, whether the division was to be merely for the purpose of the Neutral Zone oil concession or for a permanent abandonment of the Neutral &amp;one» (b) We understand that the Neutral Zone area is much used by the Awasim. Would you anticipate difficulty, in either of the events referred to in (a) on tribal grounds? (c) Can you tell us (neither we here, Puad Hamza, nor Hafiz Wahfca were able to say) what considerations led Percy Cox and Ibn Saud to lay down the boundaries actually fixed for the Neutral Zone in 1922. We assume that there was some good reason for this and it may well be that it would be material to any proposal now to divide the Zone between Koweit olonel K .R .p. Dickson. and/*./ j 2. and Saudi Arabia either for oil purposes or permanently. (d) We should, in conclusion, 'be grateful for any other comments you might have to make as to the practicability and desirability f rom the local standpoint of a 50/50 division, and on the question whether such a division should run from no&amp;th-'to south or from east to west.

Confidential. 2nd October 1934. My dear Laithwaite, ^ 1 Reference your Confidential D.0.P.Z.6075/34 of 21tyi September 1934, regarding the suggestion of Fuad Hamza for a possible division of the Kuwait Neutral Zone. 2. As you rightly saj^, any such division would have to be subject to the consent of the Sheikh of Kuwait, and I trust therefore that it will be realized that any views expressed by me now do not necessarily represent those of the Sheikh. 3. My answers to your para. 2 (a) , (b ), (c ) , (d ) , taking them generally, are as follows. I have on several occasions discussed with the Sheikh the question of how he proposed to share the advantages and profits arising out of any oil Concession that might eventually be granted in the Heutral Zone. His answer has always been that these would naturally be shared by both Bin Saud and himself on a 50/50 basis. He has never suggested, let alone hinted, that he would favour an actual division of the Heutral Zone into halves. I feel siire, therefore, that the Sheikh would reject, and in strong terms, any suggestion on these lines, whether the proposed division were to run north So south, or east Ss west. 4. My reasons for saying this are several, and may be summarized roughly as follows:-(ii)/ iv9 2. (i) The Sheikh looks on the leutrsl Zone as his 'by right, and considers it the one portion of his territory which he was a-ble to save, when, as he puts it, \ Sir Percy Cox handed over two-thirds of his kingdom to Ibn Saud. Any suggestion of dividing to-day what he believes to be his, and what he hopes seme day will of itself fall into his hands in the ordinary course of events, will, I think, be resented and resisted. It must not be forgotten that Sheikh Ahmad was young, shy and inexperienced, and had just come to the throne, when these events took place. He undoubtedly was bitterly disappointed at what Ije felt was the sacrificing of Kuwait to placate the great Ibn Saud, and was only constrained to accept the situation (as he has often told me) because he felt that he could not stand up to Sir P. Cox and so to H.M.G -.V He also tells the story of how Sir Percy on his return from Cjair and obviously feeling sorry for him,premised that, should .Bin a Saud's fortunes ever decline, or/turn m the v/heel of fortune ever give Kuwait her opportunity, then no one would, least of all hinder him from trying to recover his lost territory once again.tJ. »• (ii) The ITeutral Zone possesses some of the best grazing on the Eastern Seaboard of Arabia, and is an absolute necessity to Kuwait, seeing that the Kuwait tribes have not a sufficiency of grazing,especially in lean years in their own country. The annual grazing migrations of the Kuwait tribes (.Fidawiyeh and Araibdar) commence firstly in the direction of the northern area of Kuwait State; a move is then made to the western area, which continues slowly down the Eastern side of the 'Batin' Valley. Uext the 'Subahiyeh' and 'Manaqish' Zones (S.S.W. of Kuwait) are visited and grazed over, and finally the ITeutral Zone is entered and its pasture land systematically dealt with. Kuwait and her tribes possess some 25,000 to 30,000 camels, and a fsir greater number of sheep. It is physically impossible for these to satisfy themselves in Kuwait proper, even in ordinary years, let alone years such as we have had in 1933/34 when rains only arrived in March. (iii) At present the Sheikh's tribes have a clear right to enter the ITeutral Zone whenever they please. Were a division of that area to take place, there is nothing to prevent Bin Saud turning nasty, and refusing to permit them to enter that portion of the Heutral Zone allotted to him. This indeed might be expected to happen/happen, as a means of hurting Kuwait. For the Kuwait tribes to save thanselves would have to cross over the border into Saudi territory, where .'Bin Saud would no doubt know how to win them permanently over to his side, by the same slow and sure methods which he has adopted in the case of the 'Dhafir' (Iraq) tribe. IT or could the Sheikh ever hope to prevent this, if his tribes were faced with starvation for their flocks for several years in succession. (iv) At present Bin Saud's officials only enter the Neutral Zone to collect 'Zikat' from the Nejd n Awazim f ', who like the Kuwait tribes annually visit the Ueutral Zone. ITo where does either the Sheikh or Bin Saud maintain or establish posts in the Zone. This arrangement suits Kuwait, for it keeps Bin Baud's military posts at a distance, and south of Arak. A division would bring the King's posts 20 miles nearer to Kuwait. (v) The premising portions of the Neutral ^ ■' * ■ ■■■ i Zone from an oil point of view, are supposed to be (as far as anything certain can be said about it) on the south side and in the vicinity of 'Ain el Abd' and 'Maqtaa' region, and again on the western side in the vicinity of 'Jebel Powaris' (see sketch sent yesterday). Very premising surface indications, I believe, have been found at both these places (by Holmes working secretly seme years back). These facts are known to the Sheikh for rumour travels fast in/5. in the East. The latter would quickly realize that whether a division were Mede frcm East to West or fran Horth to South, Bin Saud would get the 'plums' and he the 'barren 'bits. 5. It is difficult after so many years to rem.ember '^maiwwuiiLuj.i. *- ^ N -'' ■ j, _ | - .^^^4 1 ' ,.. ^ ^UJ.- exactly what considerations led Sir P.Cox and Ibn Saud to lay down the 'boundaries of the Keutral Zone as they stand. As far as my recollection serves me, however. Bin Saud was not pillowed to have much say in the matter at alls for Sir P. Cox did all the settling himself % of the business. He undoubtedly was guided among other things by the following: - (a) He realised that the Kuwait tribes had an insufficiency of grazing, and must be allowed to have the extra bit, as represented by the Ueutral Zone to-day (Colonel More also brought this out clearly) (b) He appreciated the fact that Major Holmes (who was at Cjair during the Iraq-Hejd b oundary negotiati ons) showed remarkable anxiety to get the 'Ain el Abd' region included in his Hassa oil concession; this I think put him on his guard, for A.P.O.Co interests even as far back as 1922 had to be watched. Hence the area was declared to be a Ueutral one. 6. One thing I remember quite distinctly as bearing on the case - Abdur Rahman al Q,osaibi who was actively assisting Holmes at Ojair, showed me 'Ain el Abd 51 on Hunter's Map of Arabia and enthusiastically explained that it and the 'Al Maqtaa' region of which it/it forms part, were the most likely oil bearing regions in North Hassa - That Bin Saud and Holmes^new this, and were out to include same in the concession which was about to be given to Holmes. (We know now that it was not so included, and that Holmes had to get a separate agreement out of the Sheikh of Kuwait later, for what camie to be known as the Neutral Zone). 6. Lastly, not only would the acquisition by Bin Saud of the southern or western half of the Neutral Zone be likely to attract Fuad Hamza (and so Bin Saud) from an oil point of view, but two birds would be killed with one stone, as such an arrangement would enable the King to secure a much greater measure of control over the Awazim in their smuggling operations. The latter, like the Kuwait tribes, have an insufficiency of grazing in their own country, the sf Suda ,! regions etc., and for three months of each year, they in like manner also enter the ITeutral Zone to graze. They always do this when the Kuwait tribes are there, as this enables them both to meet their cousins, the Kuwait Awazim sections (some 200 tents) and to arrange marriages and giving in marriage among blood relations. Bin Saud dislikes this but cannot stop the migration; he knows that during the fraternizing large quantities of contraband articles (food stuffs and cloth especially) are quietly handed over by Kuwait-Awazim to Nejd Awazim, which is distributed among the tribe generally, and is eventually talfen back to Hassa by them and sold. In other words the blockade officials are successfully flaunted and made to look ridiculous. Bin Saud and his henchnian,Bin Jaloui, would like to stop the game. 7./V 7.

(b) In a letter to the Political i ^gent, dated the J3th April 1934, the Shaikh of Kuwait officially communicated his approval of I x olitical . vgreument. DCFP_\588S&amp;P—(M'ISXi)—27 9-32—2^K&gt;,00 0 . ( C ) /■[li 7^ ' 2 - 1M ^ (c) In a letter dated the 26th May 1934 (vide Bushire printed Letter No»66i«3, dated the i3th June 1934) the Shaikh agreed, inter alia, that should any of the terms of tue Commercial Agreement between him and the Kuwait Oil Company be inconsistent or in conflict with the terms of the i critical Agreement of 6th karch 1934 between His Majesty's Government and the Company, the former would, to the extent of such inconsistency, or conflict, be subordinate to, and be control led by the latter, (d) The Shaikh^ agreement referred to in (c) has been communicated to the Kuwait Oil Company, who have accepted the arrangement as binding, and this acceptance has been comuunicated officially to the Shaikh of Kuwait. (e) The position, therefore, is that the question of the appointment of the Chief Local Representative has been settled, in a manner that is binding both on the Shaikh and the Company. 3. The letter referred to in your telegram No.2342, dated the 4th October 1934, was addressed by the rolitical Agent, Kuwait, to the Shaikh on 4th October. As the Shaikh's reply was unsatisfactory, the Political Agent subsequently interviewed him ani the Shaikh finally promised that he would not raise the question of the Chief Local Representative with the Company's representatives and that if the concession was granted to the Con^any he would agree formally in writing that the method of appointment of the Chief Local Kepresenta- tive would be as indicated in the political Agent's letter. Please see the Political Agent's report (impress Letter No. C-261, dated the 11th October 1934) in this connection, copy forwarded to you direct.

For the present, as the Shaikh has promised not to raise the question with the Company's negotiators, it will not act as an obstacle to the progress of the negotiations. sd.

If you recollect in ny Confidential ixprads Letter ^0.0-146, dated the 24th April 1954 and paragraph 6(c), I mentioned the ^act that the haikh had received a telegram from a rival Oil concern which at the time was thought to have come fran the E.0.Company ) by Holmes and Chisholm, xhe purport of. that telegram was that the strange Company Oxf ered oo tne shaikh to go one better in every respect than the Kuwait Gil Company, and was obviously sent with a view to prevent the ..haikh coming to a favourable decision with the iCu ■£ it Oil Company (as it was thought he would). The Shaikh, as you know, admitted at the time to me that he had received the telegram in question, and said that it purported to come from em all British Concern, but he would not tell me the name. 4. I believe later enquiries from London satisfied Holmes and Chisholm that the E.G.A. had nothing to do with the telegram, nor were the I.P.O. suspected. I myself came to the conclusion that it had probably been sent at the instigation of the Shaikh himself in a rather childish/ -iOn'ble Lt.-Colonel T.G.Jowle, C.B.H., political Resident in the Persian Gulf, bushih:.- 2 - irf childish attempt to try and force the Kuwait Oil Company to hid higher than they were doing. 5. I believe I have now got on the track of the senders of the telegram, but of course I say this with the greatest reserve , seeing that my evidence is only of a circumstantial nature at present. It was Messrs: Frank trick &amp; Co., of Basra (and London), working t rough their Lawyer in Basra, r .B. . Mi rza Mohame d, G.1.3,, 6. I have also practically proved that friend Mlrza Mohamed is in secret partnership wltlr llr.Gabriel, the Shaikh T s lawyer (thereby also hangs a tale where the Shaikh's date gardens are concerned), and that before I returned from England the former sent Mr.Gabriel on 20th August last to Kuwait , to see the Shaikh. L'r. Gabriel was armed with a completely drawn up and printed Oil agreement in which he offered the Shaikh every single thing he wanted including money, royalty, director, Chief Local Representative etc., etc. The figures of course being better in every respect than those offered by the Kuwait Oil Company. 7. The Shaikh was, I understand, very gratified that another Company had come forward to bid against the Kuwait Oil Company, but when he was asked to sign, his native caution came to his aid and he said so, and told Gabriel that the Company he represented must first go to Eis Majesty's Government in London, be ^vetted'' and then come back with His Liajesty's Government * s blessing. 8. The Shaikh himself and 'quite off his own bat Tt after pledging me to secrecy, told me the story and said that the completely drawn up concession had been brought nim^Iraq and by an Iraqi,sthat he had been pressed hard to sign. He declined to say however who the person was who brought the papers to him, nor y /ould he divulge the name of the Company. ' 9. I have not of course discussed a word of the- 3 - of the above with either .'lajor T; :olues or 1 J?. Chisholm of the Kuwait Oil Company, but fran one or two remarks which the former has passed I should not be surprised if he was not himself well on the track of the enemy. 10. One thing I have gathered, and that is that T 'olmes and Chisholm are not working as smoothly as they should be these days. The reason may be (and I only suggest this, mind you) that Holmes has found out about the rival concern, and puts down 'Che whole business to plot on the part of the A.r.0, v« .o f double cross ' the -.-uwait Oil (Joiapany, and may also feel that Ghisholm is not as ignorant of the business as he pretends to be. 11. The following facts are significant, I think: (a) ?»Strick &amp; Co., are connected dth the A.T.O.C. and receive an annual sum of money from the latter for 'good will' etc. lb) Lirza L'ohamed is legal adviser to the A.P.0,0. Ltd. and is also lawyer to T.Strick &amp; Go. (cj --irza Mohamed and !-r.G-abrie 1 are partners in the same firm, though the -yorld believes the latter to be working with a Turk named x-rteen Jffendi. (d) I .irza llohamed recently became an Iraq subject. I'-, is it beyond the bounds of possibility that the A.r.o. 1 ^. smart in:; under the fact that they were unable themselves to get an Oil Concession out of the haikh because of the -tiinericans, for appearances sake leagued themselves with these selfsame -jnericans, and while outwardly agreeing to work with them under the name Kuwait Oil Company secretly f set themselves the task of hindering progress from the start w ith the de liberate intention of preventing the haikh rom giTin g th e Oil Coneesicn to the Itlwa it i 1 Company, and at the psychological moment and when negotiations with 'the -uv/ai t Oil Company had reached a deadlock they had readyf (L ready a new and secret subsidiary conpany to throw into the breach, and so walk off .ith the prize. This Company, of course, would in no way be cornected with the -..P.C.G., as far as the world was concerned, it -oulc be all British, and be registered in London and Irac; . IL, I gainer also that I irza - .ohamed and Tr,Gabriel are already direct ore in the nev; or: cer.. 14. i send you the above for v /hat it is worth and J hope you will not think my suggestion about the .i. .0 .0. being behind -trick too fantastic or unfair.86/1 i c* Telegram Fr cm To XX Political Resident, Bush.ire» His Majesty's Secretary of State for India London.

Bushii^e telegram dated 22nd November No.1010 and connected correspondence. KUWAIT OIL. I British Company referred to in my telegram of 19th November No.2743 'Traders Limited' have now officially requested approval of His Majesty's Government to a concession and have produced translation of letter dated September 2nd, text of which is contained in my immediately following tele- gram. Copy of Company f s letter and of draft concession follows by air mail of 30th November. Negotiations are stated to have been proceeding since last April. Financial terms are prima facie definitely more favourable to Shaikh than those offered by Kuwait Oil Company. Applicants state that their capital is British but concession gives power to assign without reference to His Majesty's Government to Company with minimum of 50% British capital and to forming of subsidiaries subject to same proviso, and does not express ly provide for British control. Company may also denounce after three years at three months' notice. Company state that they are^aware that their terms are better than those of Kuwait Oil Company. Financial position and backing of Company and their general standing is under investigation. 2. Subject to your observations Resident should at once proceed to Kuwait and interview the Shaikh and ascertain i jb ' \ • whether he confirms information given by Traders Limited, and in that event secure explanation from him of the circumstances in which he took this action in face of the warning conveyed to /-2- to him by Dickson on April 23rd (Kuwait letter C-146 of 24th April) and guarantee given by him to Kuwait Oil Company (Resident's telegram of June 20th, No. 568), If information is confirmed Fowle should intimate that he will report to His Majesty's Government for instructions, Gabriel's translation of Shaikh's letter dated 2nd September should if possible be checked by Arabic text, 1*^ h I i j 'is ' j 3. Our attitude towards Traders will be considered in the light of Shaikh's explanation and of result of enquiries which I am making here. If these enquiries show that their application must be taken seriously Political Agreement not less stringent than that of Kuwait Oil Company, together with any necessary modifications of their Commercial draft, would clearly be essential condition of permission to compete (as matter stands British safeguards in their draft are less than in the case of Kuwait Oil Company). If however their financial and other standing proves solid and if they should be ready to meet our political desiderata it might be difficult, despite their clandestine proceedings, to refuse to allow them to compete, especially as they claim that they start by being British. Positi 0 n of His Majesty's Government vis a vis Kuwait Qil Company is, as you will appreciate, most embarrassing, but I would propose to inform them, subject to Fowle's report and my enquiries as to standing of 'Traders Limited' that formal application has now been received from another Company and that we have no option but to examine it. I should be glad of your comments and Fowle's at the earliest possible moment with a view to consideration here, since fact that formal application has been made to the India Office is likely to become known ana if Shaikh confirms Traders' state ments it seems ?desirable to break news to Kuwait Oil Company bet ore they hear it from Kuwait. ^ ; « u, i i: 1 -Secretary of State for India- Ccrfvy f. &amp; - J ^ jtrC , err bfiyjyq ■ j m86/1 {Lt ® Telegram R. 27 From His Majesty*s Secretary of State for India, Londoru To Government of India, Foreign and Politics!

Britannic House, Finsbury Circus, London, 3.C.2. 28th November, 1934. Dear Laithwaite, With reierence to our telephone conversation yesterday afternoon, I enclose 6 copies of 'Alternative Article 3' of the Kuwait Concession. This article was drafted in anticipation of the possibility of the Shaikh insisting upon royalty on a won and saved' 'basis. The negotiators, however, were not empowered to produce it in negotiation without reference to London. This accounts for the omission of alternative Article 3 from the copies of Draft 5 which were sent to the India Office on 26th September. I ought to have furnished you with copies of the article as soon s-s the negotiators were authorised to use it, but I forgot \ / ^ to do so - an emission for which I apologise. ' ■ / Witn regard to the telegram from the Political Resident to the India Office which you mentioned, I imagine that the 'Draft t A !, ' to which the Political Besident refers ^ to be explained as follows: p \ S'''] On 6th November, the Shaikh wrote to the negotiators giving the Company the choice of two alternatives - 'A' (won and saved) and 'B' (exports and sales). The financial terms in 'B' were considerably higher than those in 'A', ^e negotiators expressed their belief that the Shaikh would/would accept alternative Article 3 with financial terns as in his 'A' , and we cabled them on Hovember 17tli that if they could work such an arrangement out it would be ,A acceptable to us. . 1 /- ■' ' . Vi ' \,v The Shaikh T s financial terms under alternative 'A 11 are those of which you were informed at our meeting on 24th October with the exception of royalty and taxation exemption which now figure at Rupees 3 and Annas 4 respectively. (Mr. Stevens has already informed you orally of these terms). Our latest word from the negotiators is a cable received yesterday advising us that they have discussed alternative Article 3 with the Shaikh on 22nd Hovember. The Shaikh undertook to examine the article carefully and to inform them within a few days of his decision and also to give them details of certain unimportant alterations which he required in the text of Draft Ho. 5. Up to the time of telegraphing, the negotiators had heard nothing further from the Shaikh. Yours sincerely, (Sgd. ) H.T.Kemp. ■ f Vu . aithwaite, Bsq. , India Office, * S.W.I.Article 3* In consideration of the rights granted by the Shaikh to the Company 'by this Agreement and of the assistance and protection which the Shaikh hereby undertakes to afford by all means in his power to the Company and its operations employees and property the Company shall pay to the Shaikh the following sums:- (a) Within thirty (30) days after signature of this Agreement Rupees (b) On each anniversary of the date of signature until the Company declares that petroleum has been found in commercial quantities;- Either Royalty of Rupees for every English ton (2,240 lbs.) of nett crude petroleum won and saved by the Company in Kuwait during the year ending 3 months prior to the anniversary of the date of signature, Or Rupees^ . whichever shall be the greater sum.

The position of ills Majesty^ Government is, in our view, fully safeguarded by Article IV of the Political Agree- r ■■■——- | -ment and our right of veto of any selection 1 * (he has abandoned his claim to ^appoint') v/hich Shaikh may put forward, is entirely unimpaired. Equally, under clause :4 of the Political Agreement the Chief Local Representative would have to be found from amongst principal employees of the Company and will ordinarily reside in Kuwait. 2* Company inform us that implication oi words '•in the first instance 1 ' is understood to be tt on the first occasion H . 3* I understand that Company now propose \ —— to i2. % f o s 5 u to authorise negotiators to accept 'final points 11 aey have been warned that signature by Shaikh does not necessarily involve approval of his Majesty's Government because we have now received official application irom competitors which may need coneidera- -tion and about which no statement can be made at the moment. They have undertaken to treat this informa- -tion as strictly confidential. i have reason to think that they have independent confirmation of it. 4. As Traders Limited creates a situation which may require consideration it cannot now be assumed either by Kuwait Oil Company or by the Shaikh that the approval of His Majesty's Government will necess. -arily follow when once they have agreed between themselves on the terms of a concession even though such agreement is signed. it is of course unnecessary for .Dickson to' mention hypothetical contingencies to the Shaikh but it seems that latter might assume from previous history of negotiations that he has already the approval of His Majesty's Government to grant a concession to the Kuwait Oil Company. True position is of course that grant of ary concession is subj ect to the expressed approval of His Majesty's Government. Dickson should therefore ensure that Shaikh clearly understands that his signature oi any concession should be accompanied by a v/ritten proviso that it is subject to the approval of His Majesty's 'Government.

I have discussed whole position with Dickson who agrees with the views given below. 2. Situation is (a) Shaikh is not only willing but anxious to sign Kuwait Oil Company Agreement (vide my telegram 1241 16th December) terms of which have been approved of by His Majesty's Government. (b) Shaikh quite appreciates that before doing so, he Must obtain approval of His Majesty's Government. (c) Procedure suggested in paragraph 4 of your telegram quoted above is I understand that Shaikh should sign Kuwait Oil Company Agreement subject to written proviso that it is subject to approval of His Majesty's Government, to give time to latter to examine position of Traders Limited. This procedure seems unnecessary to me. His Lajesty's Govermjient are in no way conmltted to Trader^, who as far as His Majesty's Government are concerned offer no advantages over Kuwait Oil Company, ana who having come into the field very late in day have no right i to hold up Kuwait Oil Company's Agreement. As therefore Shaikh is willing to sign Kuwait Oil Company's / fCompany f s Agreement he should in my opinion be allowed to do so. (d) In these circumstances therefore could not His Majesty's Government telegraph their approval to signature by Shaikh of Kuwait Oil Compai^. r, s Agree ment? (e) If His Majesty's Government agree to this suggestion then Shaikh's dealings with Traders lose their importance, and I will forward Shaikh's written explanation with my comments by post* C ompany's Final printed Kuwait CiliAgreement should arrive here on 20th December. -Resiaent- (Copy given to .Kuwait unaer .•L.No.C-311 01 18/12/34) •i tj/ Telegram xx From Political Resident at Kuwait. .

Mr. Rex Janson (son of Mr. Janson of the Arabian Development syndicate), with whom I have a slight personal acquaintance, had asked if he could come to see me, without indicating on what subject. On arrival he said that he had now become a director of the Arabian Development syndicate and wished, apart from establishing contact in that capacity, to explain the present position of the syndicate in regard to the Neutral zone oil concession. Mr. Janson said that he understood that the position of the Neutral Zone had been discussed with Puad Hamza. 'Bie syndicate were now in the first place endeavouring to secure a letter from Ibn Baud in respect of the Neutral Zone area of the type which they gathered would be acceptable to secondly, he was authorised IPWII.IU |»|IU .I j r ■JMH- to inform me that in the event of their securing the Neutral Zone concession they would part with it only to a genuine British company - not a company similar to that which was operating in Bahrein, but a genuine British company with British capital behind it. Not to put too ^e a point on it, they would be prepared to transfer their interest to the A.P.O.G. if the A.P.O.C. were Prepared to take it. 7 I thanked Mr. Janson for this information, andqxfi - 2 - without referring to the fact that the A.P.O.C. could not themselves operate a concession in the Neutral zone s but would have to transfer it to the I.p # Ct 5 said that presumahly transfer would he on the syndicate's own financial terms. Mr. Janson said that he could go so far as to say that those terms would not he in any way exorbitant or unreasonable. The syndicate would, he thought, prohahly he content to get their money hack: together with some understanding in regard to royalty. A reference was made to the arrangement between the Eastern and General Syndicate and the Bahrein Petroleum c Company, under which the Eastern and General syndicate are entitled to an overriding royalty in respect of production ahove a certain figure, hut Mr* Janson did not mention any specific hasis for a royalty under standing. ■ 4. I said that our position had heen made clear in my letter to Mr. Janson, senior, of 24th September, • f? P4Z*6025/34. Ihe enquiries we had made had gone to shew in the first place that there was no definite commitment on the part of the Saudi Government to the lip ^ 0 \ Syndicate. (The Arabic letter from the King, which i Mr* Ydlibi. had given me at the interview on 24th May, incidentally seemed so worded as fully to safeguard the position of ibn Saud). secondly, our information^ such as it was, was definitely to the effect that the state ment made to me by Mr. Yalibi in May last (and also ^ referred to in Mr. Awayni's Note of 10th toy ' o (^•2.3487/34)) that the American interests which had ' ;e sn concerned in this area were out of the field was WW ■ - - ■ ■■■' ■ incorrect. I did not think that we had asked specifically/- 3 - specifically tor a letter from Ton saud himself. But if Ion Saud was in fact iree definitely to commit himself to the syndicate in respect of his interest in the Neutral Zone there seemed no reason why he should not do so if he wanted to. If, on the other hand, his h&amp;nds were not free, either because of any overriding option he had granted to the ^American interests or for any other reason, then the proposition was not a business one so far as we were concerned, we could not facilitate approaches to the sheikh c)f Koweit or recomrnend the sheikh of Koweit seriously to consider ariy offer put forward, save by interests which were in a position to make a really firm offer. That did not appear to be the position of the syndicate at the present time. 5. Mr. Janson intimated that he appreciated the position and realised that the American interests appeared to have some stranglehold on Ibn saud. He saia tnat he thought the position was probably that on the one hand the California Oil were in no hurry to see this area developed unless and until it suited them, and that probably the same was true of the A.P.O#C. The Syndicate would, however, proceed with the steps which it was taking to endeavour to clear the position with th e saud i Go v e rnme nt. (Sd.) J.G. LAITHWAITE. ^dia office. ^th November 1934.RECORD OF A MEETIHG HUILD 47 TIED FOBBIGN OFFICE ON THE 7TII NOT- M v IBSR TO CONS ID :H Tff' FUTUI^B OF THE KQ-.EIT mmTRAL ZONE. The following were present:- ICr, Rendel, Foreign Office; Sir Andrew Ryan, His Majesty's Minister at Jedda Mr. Laithwaite, India Office. Mr. Johnstone) ) Foreign Office, Mr, Male cam ) MR»Ei-uiSEL recalled, by way of introduction, that Fuad Bey Hamza, the Saudi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, had made a personal and unofficial suggestion during the conversation which took place at the Foreign Office on the 25th September (see page 5 of the record in E 6018/4/B5) that 'the Neutral Zone should be 'bisected, either for purposes of the Aoil/ concession 'only, in which case the concession iit the northern half 'would be within the gift of the Sheikh of Koweit only, 'and that for the southern half within the gift of the 'Saudi Government only, or by a definitive political 'partition, a new frontier being drawn across the 'middle of the Zone, the northern half being completely 'incorporated in Koweit, and the southern half 'completely incorporated in Saudi Arabia'. After some discussion, Eaad Bey had been informed that, while this suggestion seemed at first sight to offer a possible solution of the difficult problems connected with the grant of an oil concession in the Neutral ^one, TTis Majesty's/Majesty^ Government would have to give careful consideration bo tlie various aspects of tiie matter Tbefore they could say whether they would be ready to follow up the suggestion which Fuad Bay had made. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent at K owe it would however be consulted without delay, and if His Majesty 1 s Government considered it desirable to pursue the idea, the Saudi Minister in London would be informed, 2, The purpose of the present meeting was to consider the matter in the light of Colonel Dickson*s yields, which had now been received, (see Mr. Laithwaite*s letter F,Z. 6160/34 of the 4th October to Mr. Rendel), These views were strongly adverse to Puad Bey f s proposal, and were supported by a number of arguments which at first sight seemed extremely strong, 3* Mr, Rendel was however doubtful whether all the premises of Colonel Dickson's arguments were in fact sound. They seemed to be based on the assumption that the Sheikh of Koweit already possessed effective rights over the Neutral Zone and that by the proposed partition the Sheikh would be virtually giving up these rights. But this premise was faulty. The Sheikh 's rights, though equal with Ibn Saud 's, were no greater and could only be exercised with Ibn Saud's concurrence and co -operation. Should we therefore really be asking f the Sheikh to give up any rights by asking him to agree t-o the partition of the Zone? Other considerations apart, it was difficult to see how the Sheikh could be represented as the loser if by giving up half-rights over half the zone he was to acquire full rights over the/3 the other half. 4, Colonel JDickson had laid much stress on the imp e mane nee of Ibn Saud^ rule, and seemed to belfeve that the area had been made a neutral zone partly at least in order to give the Sheikh a pretext for eventually reclaiming or regaining it if conditions were advantageous - for example, if the Saudi regime should collapse. Such an assumption hOYvevsr could not be justified. The Saudi rights in the zone were legally established by treaty, and could not be regarded as temporary or liable to lapse, 5» MB, MALCOLIvi mentioned that he had now ascertained f that Sir Percy Cox had stated, when reporting the signature of the Uqair protocol (Bagdad despatch to Colonial Office Ho,877 of the 20th December, 1922,) that 'the reason for 'the creation of this neutral enclave was that a rumour 'had been started that signs of oil had been noticed in 'the vicinity of the Khor Maqta. In view of this I did 'not feel able to agree to its allocation to either party 'until the rumour had been set at rest' # It seemed moreover evident from the us e of the words 'to either party' that Sir Percy Cox at least did not consider the Neutral JSone to be the Sheikhas by right. MR, RSNDEL added that the fears expressed by Colonel Dickson, lest the acqufeition by Ibn Baud of half the Neutral Zone in full sovereignty should lead to the establishment of v fortifications etc., could easily be met by subjecting the partition to special conditions. 6. ME, lEKDEL felt however that there was much force in some of Colonel Dickson 's other arguments. There was no doubt, for example, that the oil which had been observed in 1922 lay in the southern haif of the Zone, and it/it wslX 1)6 tiio.'t if 'tiie Zon© W6r© divided 'th© 'trilDciX factors in the case would also operate to the detriment of Koweit, 7 • ^ ^*■ - * - ■ j - said that he v?as impressed 'by Colonel Dickson 1 s conclusions, although he considered that they were to some extent founded on false p emises. Sir Andrew Ryan thought that in the event of ft he disintegration 01 Saudi Arabia, the Sheikh 1 s position nvould not have been altered much, if at all, by tbe partitioning of the Zone, since in such conditions the Sheikh would merely acquire whatever he could hold. Ilhe maintenancepf the Neutral Zone unpartitioned Y ^ould give the Sheikh of Koweit no more right to acquire the southern part of it in full sovereignty than if the southern part weTe now made over in full sovereignty to Ibn Saud, We should in either case be faced by a further fait accoiapli . 8. On the question of the tribal grazing rights in the Neutral Zone, Sir Andrew Ryan found Colonel Dickson's arguments impressive, and he recalled that Mr. Rendel had v/arned Fuad Bey that there might be serious difficulty on that score. ME.KENDBL nevertheless did not think the difficulties insuperable. He pointed out that certain tribes, notably the Euwalla, roamed and grazed freely through the deserts of Gyria, TransJordan and northern Nejd. The same freedom might be obtained by some special agreement for the tribes which now grazed in the Neutral Zone. 10. Similarly there were no fortifications in the Neutral Zone at present - a fact which as pointed out by Colonel Dickson was doubtless very convenient for the/the Sheikh - but this state of affairs might equally he perpetuated hj agreement, in .he event of the Zone being partitioned. 11* SIR ANDB EYAH , reverting to -fche question of grazing rights, &lt;;.aid. that he understood Colonel Dickson's view to be that the existence of these grazing rights was a consequence of the neutral charact r of the zone. The true position i.ii^ht 'well be, in tne absence of any treaty provisions, thct uhey could only be exercised with the sanction of both rulers. However that might be it was evidently possi Dl© that the existing practical position might be seriously disturbed by a partition of the zone. 12. As regards the question of oil, Sir Andrew Ryan believed it was still very uncertain where the deposits v/ould actually be found. then SpLB AKDRSW BYAB'/ observed that on both occasions when Fuad Hamza had spoken of the possible partition of trie Neutral Zone, he (Sir Andrew Hyan) had been struck by Fuad Bey's appearance of throwing out the suggestion, not as one which he or his G-over ment advocated but as a solution which might be resorted to if all else failed. MB. Br'KDEL said he had formed the same impression. SIB AHDIiE^ RYAH thought therefore that it might be possible to shelve the proposal and only take the matter up again if and when the Saudi Goverranent reverted to it, aft r all other possible solutions had been discarded. 14. Our best policy might, he suggested, be to keep the idea in mind with all the necessary safeguards for grazing rights, non-fortification and for the equitable division of/6. 17/. f the oil rights, but to treat it as a gis aller . and.if an pportunity ocoureed. to discourage Fuad Hamza from pursuing t any further. I 5 * said that he had. two points to make, tofirat was the psychological reaction on the Sheikh of mohing a subject such as the present with him. This had ireadjr been touched on by Sir Andrew Hyan. Mr.Laithwaite, hlle prepared to agree that some of colonel Dickson's premises Ight be open to question, said that the India Office were erertheleas convinced that it would be a psychological error, n t he l ight o± Colonel Uickson's remarks, to raise the question 1th the Sheikh, particularly at the present tin.. He pointed at at the same time that, however imperfect the Sheikh's rights nthe Neutral Zone might be. Ibn gaud's were of course no better. He thought the Sheikh would probably prefer not to exchange Is present half-rights over the whole zone for full rights over alf of it. 16. pouching the question of tribal rights in the Neutral Mr.Laithwaite recalled the unluclcy history of the slat ions between the Koweiti tribes and Ibn Saud. The Sheikh, f tot Gonyention Oo. l^EH, had lost the Mutair and the Ajman, and f the great tribes which had been Koweiti before the War now •Uined any staiiding of importance only in regard to the ia« m, tribe whose rights would be most affected if the were divided would be the KoYv 'eiti Awazim, who would hare to QiOBt of their time in the Saudi sector and would become for Saudi zakat. The fact that partition would involve 8 U11 further reduction even of the small influence which he till exerted over this tribe was likely by itself to render the ro POsal unpalatable to the Sheikh.i 1 1 7. '1/m 5 17, Mr .Laithwaite 1 s second point was, he said, of a very different order, and concerned the negotiations between the Iraq Petroleuni Company and the Standard Oil Company of California which had heen progressing in secret during the summer, and which were now on the point of 'being formally opened in London. The Standard Oil Company were of course the concessionaries for the Hasa coast and held the Saudi option for the Neutral Zone, but the present negotiations had arisen primarily out of the difficulty which their offshoot, the Bahrein Petroleum Company, had met with in their search for a market, for example in the Far East, for their oil. 18. The object of the Iraq Petroleum Company was, according to Mr.Fraser (who .was acting for the Iraq Petroleum Company), the double one of'eliminating independent American interests from the area in question, and of meeting the threat which a very large new production by those interests would constitute in the market. The Standard Oil Company had now intimated their readiness to negotiate and their Chairman himself was expected in London at the beginning of November for that purpose. 19. Mr.uvaser had emphasised that it was too early to say what sort of arrangement, if any, might be reached; but he had indicated that no transaction was likely to be entirely satisfactory to the Iraq petroleum Company which did not result in the exclusion of the Standard Oil Company from independent operations in the Gulf Sheikhdoms and from Ibn Saud's territory; a^d that the Iraq Petroleum Company were anxious to secure as a minimum a 50^ interest in the operations of the Standard Oil and subsidiary com anies in this area. Other possibilities, according to Mr.Fraser, were a deal about marketin^ ^ne efxect of which would be to give the Bahrein Petroleum Company some share/ i i8, are in maricets at present closed to them, in return for some derstanding as to volume of production; the 'buying out of the hrein Petroleum Company altogether; joint operation; or an rangeaent under which the position in Bahrain remained changed, feut the Ira^ Petroleum Company in return for rketing concessions to the Bahrein Petroleum Company secured unter-concessions from the Standard Oil Company in respect of e Hasa area® 20# Mr.Laithwaite added that any agreement which might suit from the present-far-reaching negotiations would of •urse have to 'be squared with the rights of the local rulers, id be pointed out that no such agreement could fail to affect ■ ie future of the Neutral Zone# The possibility that the 'aq Petroleum Company might secure a share or even a control the Bahrain and Hasa concessions was one of the highest iportance to the interests of His Majesty^ Government* It , is therefore necessary to proceed with the greatest circumspection i dealing with the proposed concession in the Neutral Zone, id the existence of these negotiations seemed to him a strong 'gument against pursuing the question of partition# 21* In reply to Sir Andrew Ryan, who said he had heard of jcent meetings toeing held at Bahrain between three different oil iterests, Mr. Laithwaite explained that in response to an ivitation from the Bahrein Petroleum Company three experts ^Presenting the constituent elements in the Ira^ Petroleum 3 ®pany (with the exception of the French, who were not directly ^Bociated with the present discussions) had gone to Bahrain Q order to test at first hand the Bahrein Petroleum Company's stiaate of the quality of their oil# The French group were owever known to toe very suspicious of these manoeuvres, and it was/fts lignilicant that an enterprising ^renchiaan^ M« de Montaigu, had chartered an aeroplane at Basra and had flown direct to Bahrain in order to investigate on their 'behalf. IR,, ^fAN added that he had heard something of these discussions a few days earlier from Mr. Hamilton of the Standard Oil Company of California who, though apparently anxious to be coamunicative, had spoken too casually to b e very lucid. Sir Andrew Ryan had gained the impression that all the local oil interests were engaged in the present discussions# ^ replied that he understood that all the groups of the Ira^ Petroleum Company ^viz; the Anglo-Persian Oil Goupany, Royal Dutch Shell, the American and the French groups) could claim to be consulted and to be given an opportunity of taking up any concession in which the Iraq Petroleum Company, as such, •ffaa interested, but that in practice any two groups oould work such a concession. Mr.Hamilton no doubt had had this in mind* MR* HBNDEL then summarised the views which had 'been considered at the meeting and suggested that agreement h ad heen reached on the following points:- (1) that in view of the hoped-ior outcome of the oil negotiations now beginning, it would be preferable for His Majesty^ Government to keep fluid the situation in the Koweit Neutral Zone, ana thus preserve intact the Sheikh's right of veto for use if necessary, (8) that nothing would be lost by thus delaying progrss, (3) that it would be better not to risk antagonising the Sheikh at this juncture by broaching the idea of a division of the Koweit Neutral Zone# Mr.Rendel, though unable to regard Colonel Dickson^ i arguments/10. 28./ arguaents as entirely sound, said he had nevertheless reached the same conclusion, viz: that nothing should be done for the time being. SIR Amm* HTAN agreed that he would rather pursue some other line for aa long as possible. Mk. he^ bt ., continuing, said that if the Saudi Government should return to the charge ty asking whether His Majesty's Oovernaent had formed any views regarding i^uad Bey's proposal, it was of course open to us to reply 'You must lirst clear up the contusion which has been •created by your promising the concession to both candidates 'at once'. Mr.Mendel thought however that such a reply would be liable to expose His Majesty's Government to of obstructiveness* —Juilll sione asked whether the Saudi proposal could rrt be communicated privately to the Sheiiciu The Sheilch would certainly turn it down at once,and we should then be able to tell the ^audi Government that His Majesty's Governaent, in consequence, thought it useless to go on with the idea* V. MR* R&amp;iDKL doubted whether such a reply would find much credence with the Saudi Government, and Sir Andrew Ryan pointed out that the whole proposal might only be an idea of Fuad 5ey f s, and not one which could be represented to the Sheikh as emanating officially from the Saudi Government# MR. LAITHWAITE reminded the meeting that the Koweit oil negotiations must not be overlooked# He suggested that we ■ight inform the Saudi Government that after examining the past history of the Neutral Zone and the reasons for its creation, Hie Majesty's Government greatly doubted whether, in view of the obvious and serious difficulties which a division of the Neutral 2one would raise, the Sheikh would be willing to entertain the 3audi Government 1 s proposal#11# _ 28. SIHMDHEi™ aai. that he woul* prefer to wait untU &gt;1. return to Jedda and see whether Fuad Bey revived the aatter. then suggested that in that case the best line might M to do nothing at all. feu t .Wn,^^ , aa (loubtful .hether His Majesty's Government could confine themselves to a ^ parely negative attitude ana insist indefinitely on the Saudi kivernnent clearing up their difficulties with the two Companies .'ir.t of all. He enquired further what attitude His Majesty's tovernmeut woa^u auopt in that event towards Mr.Ydlibi and his iyndioate, if either the Saudi Government or Mr. Jans en were to i«ek a definition of that attitude, 29. MK. LAiT;iW,AI?K explained that as Mr.Jansen had gone ... » Africa for some months, it was not to be expected that Ir.Ydlibi would be very active in the near future. SO. Alter some further discussion, it was agreed that, in 'l*w of the following considerations (1) the improbability, on ** lnforBati on available, that the Sbeito would consider Wourably a proposal lor the division of the Neutral Zone, 2) the forthcoming oil negotiations, (3) a possible settlement , '•dioally altering in iavour of His Majesty 's Government the 'hole state of oil politics in the Persian Gulf, (4) the ,■ xew ol the Koreit oil negotiations, of the ••••nt time lor approaching the Sheilch with such a proposal as ' ttad Bey hatl uade ' ( 5 ) th e i'aot that His Majesty's Government • under no obligation to pursue the matter with the Saudi ■overnaent, (i) Puad Bey should be left to revive the matter if he ished to, and .i''' (ii) if he aid so.

After Compliments, I have, with pleasure, received your letter No.C-341, dated the 7th inst (14.12.54) , and have under- stood what you have stated with regard to the contents of the telegram emanating from His Majesty's Secretary of State for India in London, and dealing with the letter dated the 28th November, which he received from a certain firm calling themselves Messrs. Traders Co. Ltd. and with what the said company had stated, namely that I ha/d granted to them an oil concession covering the whole of the Kuwait territory, subject to the formal and official approval of His Majesty's Government to the grant of such a concession. That also the said company had enclosed in their letter three appendices, namely: (a) A list of the companies and gentlemen associated with their application: (b) A copy of the 'terms' agreed upon between me and the said company. (c) An English translation of a letter emanating from me, granting an oil concession to the said Company, which was forwarded through Mr.Gabriel, Advocate of Basra. And that finally His Majesty's Secretary of State for India had directed you to ascertain from me whether I confimed or otherwise, the aforesaid statement. I accordingly beg to lay before you the real facts: During negotiations with Messrs: Holmes and Chisholm and at one of our first meetings, Mr.Gabriel, the Lawyer, was in Kuwait. He informed me then that there was a British firm, which desired to take the Kuwait Oil concession and on terms which would satisfy me. I told then him (Mr.Gabriel)/^ 15 negotiations were in progress with- 2 - progress vath Messrs: Holmes and Ghisholm, and that they had asked ny leave to depart in order to consulting with their company on certain points, (in London) and that a decision had been arrived at between them and myself (to postpone negotiations) till the end of August 1954, during which period I was not at liberty to open negotiations with anyvody else. That when that period expired, if the Company he (Mr. G-abriel) represented was a purely British concern, he could communicate with them, but on the one condition that they should apply, through their local representative (in England) to His Majesty*s Government for the issue of an order to me, as without such an order I could not see my way to grant any concession* After Messrs; Holmes and Ghisholm had left(for England) and after the time limit which I promised had expired, namely on 30th August 1954, the said Mr.Grabriel brought me two copies of the terms of the concession (of Traders Ltd.) I examined these terms and found them suitable. I next wrote on the 2nd September to Mr.Gabriel a copy of which, giving exact wording I forwarded to you under my letter No.H.4/1862, dated the 8th inst.(15.12.34). Was there, I ask, anything in the wording of that letter from me j to justify the Company^ in assuming (as they have done) that I had actually granted them the concession? C Usual Ending.Translation of a letter No.R-4/1864, dated the 9th Ramadhan 1353, corresponding to the 16th December 1934, from His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait, to the Political Agent, Kuwait, After Compliments, Ihave, with pleasure, received your letter No. C-o42, dated the 7th inst. (14,12,34), and have understood what you stated therein, namely that you had been directed by His Majesty's Government to ask me t o explain the circumstances under which I secretly carried on ne gotiations, which were contrary to the warning you conveyed to me at SBayan Tt , under instructions of His Majesty 1 s Government, and to the promise I gave to Messrs Holmes and Ghisholm, which the latter communicated to you in ^ their letter dated the 13th June 1934, I I beg to say that God willing (Insha*Allah) I will never go against an order of His Majesty^ Government and that I do and shall always -ete- obey the behests of His Majesty's Government, in every respect. The nature of the negotiations that had taken place, were as outlined in my letter to you, No.H-4/1863, dated the 8th inst (15,12,34), Indeed at the time I wished to inform Major Watts of these negotiations,but they were of a very secret nature and as he did not know Arabic, and discussions with him had to be carried on by means of an interpreter, I kept the knowledge of them to myseli , for fear of being^^ betrayed. On your return (from England) we both were kept/ for sometime, with date -garden questions, out soon after wards I informed you verbally and very confidentially of everything.I trust you informed His Majesty's Government at the time what I told you. a As regards my promise to Messrs; Holmes and Chlsholm that it was for a period of three months with effect from the Uth June 1934, as they presumed to be the case in their letter (which you showed me). I admit- 2 - 7,'/ I admit that I gave a promise to the said gentlemen, but I carefully told them that the period would expire at the end of August 1934. It was I who disclosed to them that I had received a telegram frcm a British firm in London, which desi red to negotiate for as. concession* This also you heard from me. further, I warned them that should they fail to settle the question with me within this period, (i.e. by bOth August 1954) I should be compelled to open negotiations with the abovementioned new Company* These are the real facts. I have never thought, nor would I think, of going against His Majesty^ Government's orders, because I am quite sure that His Majesty's Government have got no other intention of wish than the peace and welfare of ourselves and our country. We are always most grateful to His Llajesty's Government. Usual Ending. i &gt;Confidential, No.C-323-of 1934• Office of the Political Resident ^n the Persian Gulf, Camp, KUWAIT. 21st December, 1934. From - The Hon t ble Lieut .-Colonel T .C.Fowle,C .B.iii., Jbolitical Resident in the Persian Gulf. To - His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, The India Office, London• / 1/ s 11 i \i~s' Sir, In amplification of telegram No.347, dated the 16th |)'1 December 1934, from the Political Agent, Kuwait, I have the honour to enclose copy of a letter ^■o«C—-J52, dated the 20t&lt;h December 1934 from him, and of its enclosures, regarding the Shaikh of Kuwait's negotiations with Traders Limitea. 2. It will be seen 1'rom the Shaikh's letter Ko.K/4/1863, dated the 16th December x934, that His Excellency contims generally the information communicated by Traders Limited to the India Office but denies that his letter oi 2nd September 1934 to Mr. Gabriel can be read as the grant oi a concession to that Company, and from his letter : o.V'i/1862, dated the 15th December 1934 that Mr .Gabriel's translation of the Shaikh's letter to him dated the 2nd September 1934 is correct. 3. The criticisms against the Shaikh are. (a) that in the face of the warning conveyed to him by Colonel Dickson on 23rd April 1934 he conducted i negotiations with Traders Limited without consult- ing His Majesty's Government (b) that he broke his promise to the Kuwait Oil Company not / )//«) r;-2- not to conduct negotiations with any other party for 3 months as from the 14th June 1934. 4. ^ith regard to (b) above the Shaikh maintains that he made it clear to Messrs.Chisholm and Holmes that the period oi tnree months expired at the end of August# In any case as th6 diitei'ence in time is only a fortnight and as the matter is one between the Shaikh and the Company 1 do not think that this point need be taken up with the Shaikh. 5. As regards (a) - vide his letter No.H/4/1864 of 16th December 1934 - i do not think that the Shaikh's explanation is a satisfactory one. In the first place he could have mentioned the fact of these negotiations, without going into details, to Major Watts who knows sufficient Arabic to under stand such a communication; or to Colonel Loch, who can speak Arabic, when he was here at the end of September. Moreover he did not inform Colonel Dickson who had returned to Kuwait on the 16th October about these negotiations until the middle of November. In the second place when he did inform Colonel Dickson he did not divulge the name of the company and merely stated that he had been approached by the Company, not that he had intimated to them as far back as September 2nd that, subject to their securing the approval of His Majesty's Govern ment, and their acceptance of certain conditions, he himself approved the terms ox the concession and was prepared to sign it. 6. I suggest therefore that I may be authox'ised to write to the Shaikh in the terms of the enclosed draft. 1 am sending copies ol this letter to the aoverliinent of /ifl . 3te -3- of India and the Political Agent, Kuwait. &gt;l '■•/ I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lieut.-Colonel, irolitical Resident in the Persian Gulf.-2- Government have instructed me to inform Your Excellency that they are disappointed at your disregard of their wishes in this matter, and that they will find it difficult to assist Your lixcellency in questions affecting your interests unless you, for your part, keep them fully informed thereon.

The Shaikh has the right to select in the first instance the Chief Local Representative in consultation with His Majesty* s Government'. With reference to the second paragraph of the Shaikh* s enclosed letter, the gist of his new sub-clause 9(B) is that he reserves the right to permit companies operating oil fields in neighbouring territories to trans port oil through Kuwait. With reference to the third ano. lourth paragraph of the Shaikh's enclosed letter, these refer to the fact that although we have agreed the Shaikh's financial demands including royalty, we have not yet agreed exactly the basis on which royalty is payable. With the above explanation we may suriiLiarise the position as follows. The financial terms have been settled apart from the exact royalty basis, which we hope will shortly be agreed. The Shaikh's emendations to the general terms (including his two new clauses regarding2 regarding transport of oil and accounts check) are now under consideration but should present no difficulty. article 6(A), we are informing our Directors of our opinion that that wording is acceptable, in view of the (a) that the Shaikh no longer requires to appoint the Chief Local Representative. (b) that the Shaikh has, as we understand frcm you, undertaken to conform with His Majesty^ requirements in this matter. (c) that this article is in any event governed by article 4 of the agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Kuwait Oil Company of 5th March 1934, which we understand has been formally accepted as binding by the Shaikh. As regards the Shaikh* s proposed wording for facts Your obedient servants We have the honour to be, Sir, Sd.Frank Holmes, Sd.A.Chisholm For KUWAIT OIL COMPANY LTD. To His Majesty 's Political Agent KUWAIT.No.H/4/1853 COPY. 2nd Ramadhan 1353 9th December 1954, Dear friends Major Holmes and Mr«Chisholm 5 After greetings# .e draw your attention to our letter No.R.4/1801 of 28th Hajab corresponding with'6th November 1934 with regard to the observations and the few alterations that we mentioned to you as desirable to be inserted in the draft agreement you presented to us after your return from London. We have accordingly completed (in the attached draft of the concession agreement) all the observations, alterations and cancellations required for insertion and which you will find to be in accordance with what was agreed upon with you at 'Bayan^ in last June. And we hereby inform you that we desire to add a sub-clause to article 9(B) which you will find attached in its respective place in the same article. And you have informed us at our last interview with you that your Company has decided to accept financial terms as shown in our suggestion (A) and therefore the Com pany has decided to work the oil basis on a foundation of royalty of won-and-saved. Therefore we cannot allow insertion of sub-clauses f, S n and '4' in article 5(d) as they are part of our suggestion ' T B W which you have rejected, and have chosen for your work the basis of the won-and-saved suggestion (A). Regarding our ri^ht to appoint a director to the Company*s Board in London. In accordance with discussions with you, we forego our right as shown above, but on condition that we appoint a representative in London in lieu of our foregoing this. In addition the salary of this representative should be increased from is.^OOO - to Rs.2250/• because he shall in future bear the expenses during his movements under our directions from .uondoii to Kuwait as per our instructions or to discuss our relations with the Company. 7' }•j - 2 - And we have also decided to insert a conditional clause to Article 6(d) as shown below. The insertion of this clause we find is absolutely essential for the protection of our own interests and that of our State and to prevent any dispute that may arise between us and the Company, an y dispute arises as to the accuracy of the Company s accounts in connection with the amount of - oyalty and/or other payments due for payment to us under this agreement we shall have the right to appoint (a.Lter consulting a recognised firm of accountants to check the Company's registers on our behalf either in Kuwait or inLondon as is found necessary, and we shall pay to this firm of accountants all the expenses they happen to incur for this business and the Company shall have to allow the recognised firm of accountants appointed by us all that is necessary to facilitate the work of checking the Company's books and registers and to afford them all facilities to obtain a final check of what is due to us. And we shall keep secret all the information we obtain apart from the matter under dispute for which the check has been made.' So after you present to us a copy printed and translated and we find it corresponding with copy mentioned and which is in our possession then you may inform your Company that we shall sign and grant the concession in accordance with these terms.

Subject. / ^ l vj / Oil in Kuwait Neutral Zone 1/111i it Ref. 67, Two charges against the Shaikh (a) that he conducted negotiations with Traders Ltd. without consulting H.M.G. (b) that he broke his promise to the Kuwait Oil Co. not to conduct negotiations for 3 months as from x4th June. With reference to (a) the Shaikh conducted | active negotiations with Traders from the beginning of September. He did not tell Col.Dickson about h -I till about the middle of November. If he did not want to speak through an interpreter he could for example have spoken when Col.Loch (who can speak Arabic) was here at the end of September. He knew the importance H.M.G. attached to this point. As regards (b) the Shaikh maintains that he made it clear to Mr.Chisholm that the period of three months expired at the end of August i.e. commenced from 1st June . Col.Dickson^ report (Vol.D-lOl, p.198) based on a statement of Mr.Chisholn^was that the period ran from 14th June. If the period ran from 1st June the Shaikh has kept within the letter of his promise, if from 14th June he has not as he commenced negotiating early in September. In any case he has certainly broken the spirit of it-, and could be reproved on that account. . , ; la&amp; r / /z /lt.c-jkf v lus a ■ ■ c ■ s * ^ j -^j xl- 2 - &amp; 3.

Copies of the final draft concession agreement can be found at folios 82-97 and 247-283. Other correspondents in these negotiations are the Political Agent at Kuwait (Harold Dickson, with Ralph Ponsonby Watts acting) and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Trenchard Craven Fowle, with Percy Gordon Loch acting).Also included in the file is correspondence relating to a company called Traders Limited who submitted a draft oil concession agreement to the Shaikh of Kuwait in September 1934, potentially breaching the agreement made by the Shaikh with the Kuwait Oil Company not to consider any other oil concession application during the period June to September 1934.The question of the oil concession for the Kuwait-Nejd neutral zone is also discussed, with corespondence between the Foreign Office, HM Minister in Jedda (Sir Andrew Ryan), the Secretaries of State for India and Foreign Affairs, representatives of the Arabian Development Syndicate, and the Deputy Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs (Fuad Bey Hamza). The correspondence focuses on attempts to understand how the Saudi Arabian Government is handling their share of the concession, and how this might affect Kuwait.The volume also includes confidential records of meetings held at the Foreign Office with Fuad Bey Hamza (Foreign Minister for Saudi Arabia) in which the possibility of dividing the neutral zone are discussed. The Political Agent, Harold Dickson is consulted about these proposals and provides background information on the establishment of the neutral zone, the potential detrimental effects that disbanding it could have on the nomadic tribes living in the zone, and observations on the possible oil locations which would be most likely end up in the Saudi Arabian half under any division of the zone and the detrimental effect that might have on Kuwait.Other correspondence in the file includes discussions between the Secretary of State for India, Gilbert Laithwaite (India Office), Wilfred Ashton McClaughry (Air Ministry) and Charles Stuart Burnett (Air Vice-Marshall in Iraq) regarding the possible future need for a site at Shuwaikh as an airbase, and an agreement with the Shaikh of Kuwait for mooring buoys to be placed in Shuwaikh Harbour.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Officer Commanding, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Arabian Development Syndicate Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Arabian American Oil Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Kuwait Oil Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Saudi Arabia, Āl Sa'ūd dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Traders Limited, Basra</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Fuad Bey Hamza</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Shuwaikh </geographic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Kuwait</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Kuwait-Nejd Neutral Zone</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00026a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
