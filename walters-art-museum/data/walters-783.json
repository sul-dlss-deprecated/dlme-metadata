Below appears an \"udjat,\" the eye of Horus, between two rearing cobras. The disk at the bottom depicts another pair of snakes spreading large protective wings around a seated deity in the middle.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/21977", "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1927 [mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "22nd-25th Dynasty", "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2009-09-17T15:10:01.847", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_48.1626_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_48.1626_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_48.1626_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_48.1626_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_48.1626_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "10, 1954, 2227, 2513", "Images": "CUR_48.1626_Back_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_48.1626_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_48.1626_SideA_DD_RS2009.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
