We arrived at Ahd-el-JCuri Island on the 3rd of ••Ti-il, Commander Sevan and. myself landed and interviewed the local people who stated that they had water and that there was no sickness in the Island. They also stated ^ „ . f tn&amp;t no other ship had visited the Island since B®M_, Ienhance’s n visit two years previously, a quantity of cigarettes and matches were handed over to the Islanders, and in addition Commander Bevan very kindly gave two cases 0± biscuits which were very much appreciated. 3. Socotra was reached on the 4th of April and H.M. I‘®naance t! anchored at Had!bo. I interviewed the Sultan of •M.ishn and Socotra on two occasions: once when he called on the ship and once when I returned Ms call. On jach occasion - alim bin Abdullah, Abdullah bin Ahmed, Abdullah bin Salim, and Ahmed bin Abubakr were present. The Sultan was very reticent and did not seem able to give very much information with regard to the eastern boundary of the li otectorate* It is possible that $w was suspicious of questioning and was not anxious to give a direct answer* I informed him of the relinquishing of hen jam and the establishment of a station at Bahrein. I discussed the question/ I Jquestion of edth him and referred to the obstruction that Ur. Ingram had found to his onward journey when touring the ha&amp;hramaut• fh© bultan stated that he had heard that ^r. ingroms had been touring but that he had no knowledge of any resistance having been offered to him within the iislm boundary* I gathered that the sultan considered that lie nad complete control ur to the western boundary of his State and thao the neighbouring people round Seihut and the town itself were not rebellious to his authority, he proposed to make enquiries as soon as possible with regard to Mr* Ingrams 1 incident and I feel that any suggestion of handing this area to the Sultan of Mukalla would be badly received* With the exception of a request to have his stipend paid annually, the Sultan had no other request to make. 4. In order to overcome the natural suspicion that the backward people most naturally have to foreigners, I suggest that if possible a Political Officer be sent to the Island for at least a month during the next winter* fixe people in the hills are so unaccustomed to Europeans that they immediately run away at the sight of one, and X do rot think that we shall be able to assist these people unless more contact is established between us and them. 5* We arrived at wi &amp;lw on 7th April and interviewed Sultan Khalifa bin Abdullah, the brother of the representative of the Sultan of JLshn and Socotra. Sultan khalifa stated that his brother was inland as the visit was expected to take place a month earlier, I was particularly struck by the pleasant manner of this man and his apparent wish to assist. During my interview on shore Sultan Khalifa bin Abdullah, Mubarak bin Solid an unpleasant and voluble person who was of no assistance in/©astern boundary and they were nil quite clear, as held been what he had heard and not from what he had actually seen, an old man who had been in the part of the country under discussion* j.% appears that a $&amp;di f by name hi Hanna, enters the sea just east of Has Barb at UU* this Wadi forms the boundary between Oman and % ishn, and it runs north easterly from the coast. 5 i.he frontier apparently after following the Wadi turns north-westerly and eventually joins the Wadi nl Masila* I was unable to discover for how far the frontier follows the Wadi Hanna but I gather for some distance. Sultan Khalifa identified the bin nf rid and Bin Had aba as being one and the same tribe and being together with Bin ’&gt;011 Muqaddam, Bin Haji, Bin Azale, Bin Hhorshed, Bin huqfeh, Bin Suleimi and Bin qldda, subject to the Sultan of C'ashn and Socotx'a. H© stated that the following tribes were met with from Has Barb at 1 Hli along the eastern boundary in the order in which they are written here* 1* Bin ‘All Mur add sm, 2. Bin /arid, 3. Bin i'awar, 4* Bin Haji, 5. Bin Suheil end then the manahil. Ho Mahras /re settled in Oman territory but a number who are in employment there are residing there. Without good maps it is nearly impossible to decide the value of any information obtained and whether the questions are being correctly understoa I feel that advantage should be taken of the brief visits that these persons make to Aden to cross-examine thorn on the eastern frontier* I think that they are more likely to answer the question truthfully in private than when in the presence of their suspicious tribesmen. Sultan Khalifa confirmed the Sultan*s statement with regard to Seihut, and the impression his subsequent statements were agreed to by Sa* id bin less. thf t/■thfct X hed receivad at ' oootre that interference with oeihut would not be acceptable was confirmed here. 6 ‘ m CXiived at ^ukaUa on the 9th of april and two days were spent there.

[E 3944/77/91] Record of First Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza held at the Office on June 24, 1935. THE following were present at the meeting : Mr. Rendel. Sir Andrew Ryan (His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda). Mr. Ward. Mr. Malcolm. Fuad Bey Arabian Affairs). Sheikh Hafiz Wahba (Saudi Arabian Minister in London). Mr. RENDEL recalled the discussions which had taken place with Fuad Bey in London in September 1934 and had been continued in Jedda during the winter. The most important question dealt with during those discussions had been that of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. The position was that the Saudi Government had communicated a statement of their claims to Sir A. Ryan on the 3rd April, and that Sir A. Ryan, on the instructions of His Majesty’s Government, had offered the Saudi Government a strip of territory to the east of the Anglo-Turkish boundary (generally known as the “ blue line ”), which, as Fuad Bey was aware^although it had been agreed not to stress this aspect of the question for the present—His Majesty’s Government regarded as the present legal boundary. The concession which His Majesty’s Government had now offered was shown on the map of which Mr. Rendel gave Fuad Bey a copy, by a green line, and Fuad Bey would observe that it included the whole of the western shore of the Dohat-as-Salwa, the important strategic post of Qasr-as-Salwa, and the Akhwan settlements of Sakak and Mabak (Anbak) at the base of the Qatar Peninsula, whence it ran due south to the Abu Dhabi well of Banaiyan. The Saudi Government had not yet replied to this offer, and Fuad Bey had left Arabia before it could be discussed. It had therefore been agreed that the conversations should be continued in London, and Mr. Rendel suggested that Fuad Bey should begin by giving his views on Sir A. Ryan’s offer. FUAD BEY HAMZA replied that he had the impression that the frontier line offered by Sir Andrew Ryan was not based upon any relevant material facts. The proposals contained in the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April were, on the other hand, based upon the most important factor in the desert, namely, the recognised grazing grounds (“ diras ”) of the various nomadic tribes. He was convinced that it would be impossible to draw the frontier on anything but a tribal basis of this kind, and he saw no alternative to the system proposed by the Saudi G-overnment. Mr. RENDEL observed that it would be difficult to base a line on purely tribal considerations. The greater part of the area concerned consisted of an immense expanse of featureless desert more comparable to a sea than to any ordinary land area. According to the information of His Majesty’s Government the various tribes wandered very widely over this area, and it would be impossible to base territorial claims on the extent of these wanderings. Moreover, the information in the possession of His Majesty’s Government was that many of these tribes were of uncertain and shifting allegiance. There were, of course, certain areas which were predominantly or exclusively frequented by certain tribes, owing a definite and exclusive allegiance to a particular ruler. His Majesty’s Government had taken such circumstances into full account in making their proposals. But an arrangement based on tribal considerations alone would certainly prove impracticable. SIR A. RYAN supported Mr. Rendel’s view that a simple allocation of tribal areas could not replace a territorial frontier. Every attempt to leave [431 bb—3] Bterritorial frontiers fluid, on the basis of the allocation of tribes only, had hitherto failed, e.g., on the Saudi-Iraq frontier, and it had always proved necessary to have a definite frontier establishing formal limits to territorial, as distinct from personal, sovereignty. Mr. RENDEL continued by explaining that Elis Majesty’s Government fully realised, of course, that there was no question of attempting to establish a sharply defined frontier in the ordinary European sense, with frontier posts and a close frontier control. It was, however, necessary, as Sir A. Ryan had explained, to set seme definite limit beyond which territorial sovereignty could not be exercised, even if such territorial sovereignty were not, in fact, exercised up to that limit. This would not prevent the tribes wandering freely from one territory to another, and no doubt suitable arrangements could eventually be made regarding their taxation, &amp;c., as had been done in the case of the tribes which migrated between Saudi Arabia, Transjordan, Syria, and Iraq. Arran De ments could be made defining the allegiance of various tribes or sections of tribes. But whatever was done about this, it seemed clear that a definition of the ultimate iimits of territorial sovereignty must now be established SIR ANDREW RYAN pointed out that although the line which His Majesty’s Government had now offered the Saudi Government did not run very far to the east of the Anglo-Turkish line, it did definitely take into account existing^ facts, even though these facts might be at variance with what His Majesty’s Government regarded as the technical legal position, since it conceded to King Abdul Aziz sovereignty over Qasr-as-Salwa and the Akhwan settlements which King Abdul Aziz had established to the east of the Anglo-Turkish frontier. His Majesty’s Government were prepared to concede this, and other areas permanently inhabited by Murra tribesmen of Saudi allegiance, but they could not possibly concede the whole expanse of desert over which this tribe was accustomed to range at various times of the year. FUAD BEY suggested that in drawing the northern end of the proposed tiontier m tne neighbourhood of the Qatar Peninsula, the political allegiance of actual settlements and recognised districts should be adopted as a guiding principle. He considered that King Abdul Aziz had an unassailable claim to an area considerably to the east and north-east of the line proposed by His Majesty’s Government m this sector. As regards the desert area to the south, the only method of drawing the frontier, in his view, would be to take account of wells an glazing areas known to be under the predominant control or ownership of TG ^ • 6 mam ^ a i ned ma j 0I&gt; ity of such wells and areas in South- i'l ! f ^ 7eie definitely recognised as being the property of one particular b ascertU fh h8y “U a S ° E USed by others ’ and that i£ would be possible tribal Ileal 1 ownersbl P and to make use of this knowledge in defining the the same 7™sid^bf,f d tha j P 3 Ma S est y’ s Government had been influenced by that thl wril l AU ’ and lEf 11 was for this reason that they maintained that the well of Banaiyan must belong to Abu Dhabi They were satisfied on the StUa W-nintb AT AY 1 ! 6 daim ° f the ^eikh to UTwltwhlrTas durino- the verv full HG 8 eri1 ° r ^ a sou h d one; and from what had passed the winter he iw no bnn USS f°TT 8 fiy 16 ^ 0118 which had taken place during on this point althono-h^tiA 18 M a jesty s Government modifying their attitude south of it where snob non ^ ^ VGre to d ^ scuss further concessions to the soum ot it, where such concessions might be easier to arrange. views of His^MaiestvG 6 Go C ^ ear !^ e G^mdi Government could not accept the exclusively to the Murra fribn^TT^ • a ^°V t ? a A ai ^ ai }’ which, he claimed, belonged on this point but Mr RENDTti 6 . mv °hed the evidence of Mr. Bertram Thomas showed that the Mlenf a u^ ° Ut that Mr ’ Bertram Thomas’s evidence further quoted the fact that Mr Pbilb^b 8 T WaS most uncertaill r and wards in this nefghrourhoofhi Philby had apparently been obliged to turn west- reaching the limiE^of^h^^ea 1 over whi^ 1 ^^^^^!! 06 ^! ^ ^ sovereigntv On fbG Get t? j -rT 11 Abclul Aziz exercised effective only been turned back ^tTdTtL Uad T ey J e ?P d that Mr - P bd by had in fact BEY repeated his conation tW T, 7 hlS Gfi 16 to find “y water. FUAD ana D' an could not be regarded as belonging2 t to Abu Dhabi; but this point was not pursued at this meeting, although it was alluded to from time to time, and it was not until the next meeting on the following day that Fuad Bey developed it further. g tfte FUAD BEY then reverted to the question of the northern terminal of the line now proposed by His Majesty s Government, and tried to show that King Abdul Aziz could claim not only Qasr-as-Salwa, but the hills to the north-east of it up to a point some 10 or 15 miles up the eastern shore of the Dohat-as-Salwa. He claimed that the frontier should run thence in an easterly direction and then turn slightly southwards and run to the sea to the north of Khor-al-Odeid. A long discussion followed on the question of this line As regards the north-western end of it Mr. BENDED pointed out that the Qatar Peninsula was a clearly defined geographical feature. It was almost an island, and it was only reasonable that the frontier between it and its neighbours on the mainland should follow the natural geographical division between the mainland and the peninsula itself. It was because of this natural geographical division that His Majesty’s Government had been prepared to concede to King Abdul Aziz the whole of the western shore of the Dohat-as-Salwa, but this same argument applied in turn with equal force against carrying the frontier up the eastern shore of the bay. If this were done the same anomaly would be created as that which at present existed on its western shore. His Majesty’s Government had in fact offered King Abdul Aziz a most generous concession in this area, including the important strategic point of Qasr-as -Salwa. Moreover, the Jebel Naksh and the hills in its neighbourhood were part of the same geographical formation as the Jebel Dukhan, which was indisputably the property of Qatar. The case, therefore, for following the natural geographical frontier at this point appeared overwhelming. The discussion on this portion of the line was resumed at intervals at various stages of the conversation, and eventually FUAD BEY asked whether His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to offer a line, which he indicated on the map, running eastwards and south-eastwards from the eastern shore of the Dohat-as-Salwa, and following for some distance the circumference of a circle with a radius of some 10 or 15 miles from Qasr-as-Salwa. Mr. RENDEL explained that he had no authority to offer any concession on this point. He had had the greatest difficulty in securing general agreement for so large a concession as that which had, in fact, been offered. As Fuad Bey no doubt knew, His Majesty’s Government were, in fact, committed to the protec tion of Qatar against any major aggression. If His Majesty’s Government were to make any further concession to the north-east of Qasr-as-Salwa, they would so weaken the position of Qatar strategically that they might not be able effectively to carry out this obligation. Just as Qasr-as-Salwa might be regarded as an important strategic outpost for Saudi Arabia, so the area to the north-east of it was an essential strategic area from the point of view of the safety of Qatar. Indeed, it was much more important for Qatar to retain this area than for Saudi Arabia to hold Qasr-as-Salwa, since Qatar was a very small State with no hinterland, whereas Saudi Arabia covered a vast area, and was therefore in a far stronger position from the point of view of defence. FUAD BEY at a later stage of the meeting stated, in reply to a question by Mr. Ward, that he thought that King Abdul Aziz might be prepared to abandon his claim to the Jebel Naksh, which he described as an outlying spur of the Jebel Dukhan range. . Fuad Bey then raised the question of the Saudi claim to Khor-al-udeid, which he described as being the most vital point at issue, and to which he main tained that King Abdul Aziz possessed an established and irrefutable right. He explained that the Khor-al-Odeid had in the past been well known as a landing place for merchandise for the Hasa coast, and that King Abdul Aziz could not abandon an outlet to the sea which possessed such important possibilities of commercial development. SIR A. RYAN pointed out that Fuad Bey had told him at Jedda, when describing the Saudi claims, that King Abdul Aziz wanted to secuie Khor-al- Odeid in order to stop smuggling through it into Saudi territory, and that this seemed rather inconsistent with the contention that it was needed foi commercial development. [431 bo—3] B 2FUAD BEY replied that King Abdul Aziz did, indeed, wish to stop smuggling, but also had an eye to the possibilities of the future. He knew that the King felt strongly that he must have an outlet to the sea in this direction. Mr. WARD and Mr. MALCOLM explained that, according to the informa tion in the possession of His Majesty’s Government, the Khor-al-Odeid was, in fact, extremely shallow and practically useless as a harbour. Fuad Bey did not. however, pursue this point. Mr. RENDEL explained to Fuad Bey that he saw no prospect of His Majesty’s Government being able to modify their attitude on this part of the line. In the first place, they were committed to' the recognition of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi’s claim to the whole of the Khor-al-Odeid, having told the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, to whom they were bound by treaty, that they regarded his territory as extending round the Khor and up to the north-eastern point of the mouth of the Khor. They could not give away the sheikh’s territory. His Majesty’s Govern ment could not violate or disregard their obligations to these Trucial rulers, even when these obligations involved them in difficulties with other Powers. The same situation had arisen in regard to certain islands belonging to the Jowasimi Arab rulers which were claimed by Persia, where His Majesty’s Government had been obliged firmly to resist the Persian claims. For the same reason His Maiesty’s Government could not admit any Saudi claim to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi territory round the Khor-al-Odeid. , But apart from this, as Fuad Bey was aware, His Majesty’s Government had long had a very strong interest in the whole stretch of the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf from Qatar to Muscat. The Sheikhdoms of Qatar, Abu Dhabi &amp;e formed a chain of States with which His Majesty’s Government had had special relations for a very long period, ever since the days when they had been obliged to assume a certain measure of control in this area in order to stop piracy gun- running and the slave trade. The maintenance of this measure of British control ivas an important principle of British policy in the Persian Gulf.

Would it not then be wise to accept the present offer of a sound and permanent frontier rather than perpetuate a situation which must inevitably be unstable and might ead to serious difficulty eventually? The frontier which His Majesty’s Government hTd proposed was geographically sound and corresponded to the facts of the situation as they had been ascertained as the result of long and careful enquiry He begged Fuad Bey to consider the question afresh on this basis. ' ^ FUAD BEY gave no indication that King Abdul Aziz would be nrenared to modify his attitude. If Mr. Rendel’s instructions were rigid so were Ms 0 rm i W fM VentUa y a f reed ’ h T eVer ’ that Fuad Be y and the Saudi Minister should study the maps and material communicated to them and seek instructions from their Government. On the receipt of these instructions, the question would be considered how far the discussions could be further usefully pursued. Foreign Office, June 25, 1935.E AS TEEN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL. [E 3946/77/91] Record of the First Part of the Second Conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza held on June 25, 1935, at 1L50 a.m. THE following were present: Mr. Eendel. Sir A. Eyan. Mr. Ward. Mr. Malcolm. Fuad Bey Hamza. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba. Mb. REIS DEL opened the conversation by informing Fuad Bey that in order to make it clear that His Majesty s Government were not adopting a purely negative attitude he wished at once to state that they were ready to offer King Abdul Aziz a further concession of territory to the south and east of Banaiyan m addition to the “green line” offer which had been made by Sir Andrew Eyan in April last and had formed the subject of discussion at the meeting on the 24th June. This further concession was the area bounded on the north, east, and south by what was shown jf which he then handed to Fuad Bey, as a brown line and miofit therefore be known in future as the “brown line concession a line that is running from a point on the “ green line ” to the south of, and distant at least 5 miles from, Banaiyan, to the intersection of meridian 52° E. and parallel 20° 30' N.; thence due south along meridian 52° E. to its intersection with parallel 19° N. and thence in a straight line to the intersection of parallel 18° N. with the violet line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914. Fuad Bey was given a map on which the two concessions were marked. FUAD BEY HAMZA, in reply, said that as a result of the first day’s conversa tions he had re-examined the information in his possession regarding the proper attribution of Banaiyan, which His Majesty’s Government had claimed on behalf of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. He was now satisfied in his own mind not merely that the well of Banaiyan belonged to the Murra tribe, but that sheikhs of this tribe, who were definitely in the service of King Abdul Aziz, controlled a string of wells (which Fuad Bey named) running eastward from Banaiyan as far as Safq (Sufuk). Mr. EENDEL suggested that it would be of assistance to His Majesty’s Government in considering these claims if Fuad Bey could provide a memorandum stating the Saudi view of the position in detail and giving the fullest possible evidence in support of it. FUAD BEY agreed to do so. It was then agreed to proceed to the discussion of various secondary questions, the first of which was the possible acquisition by His Majesty’s Government of certain minor air facilities on the Hasa coast of Saudi Arabia. This part of the conversation is recorded separately. Eastern Department, Foreign Office, June 25, 1935. [431 bb—1]'' L -i- H: f. 1 ^ Mr. w^Jaon, Sir L. Waicely, Sir p. Stewart. Blue I.lne PiseuaainnQ . Discussions have been proceeding between the Foreign Office (with sir Andrew Byan) and Fuad Hamza regarding the Blue Line. Briefly, the Saudis have strongly pressed their claim to concessions on the West side of the Qatar Peninsula, to the Khor-al- Odeid and to Banaiyan. The Foreign Office (whose minutes I have seen) have handled the discussions £&amp; teas* very well and have been quite uncompromising on both points. There is some reason to think that the S&amp;udis will give way about the Khor-al-Odeid and Qatar. 2. On the other hand (though this may be partly bluff) they, are at the moment concentrating on Banaiyan. They claim that the well at Banaiyan and also a string of wells running about 10 miles to the East from it to a place called sufak, belong to the Murra and properly fall within Saudi territory and not/i not that of Ahu Ehahi* Here again the Foreign Office - have been quite uncompromising with the Saudis. But (as was made clear in the course of informal discussions at the official dinner to the Emir Saud last night) they would like to concede this point if possible. 3. Banaiyan, which is a very important well on the edge of the Great Desert, is probably a key point in this area. We have no definite information as to whether or not it is in the occupation of the Mirra, but we have always pressed that it should be regarded as falling within Abu Dhabi territory. Cdbnel Loch, in a recent letter, mentioned that he was almost certain that the shaikh of Abu Dhabi had raised the question of Banaiyan with him in the course of his conversations early this year. It has no historical association with the Saudis. There are good reasons therefore for holding on to it if at all possible, though given the general desirability of a territorial &gt; settlement with Ibn saud, it would, I think, in the last resort be undesirable to let it break down on the question of Banaiyan if in return for conceding this/■ST''3 this we were able to secure the withdrawal of all Saudi claims to the Qatar Peninsula and the Khor-al- Odeid and on the borders of the Aden Protectorate and the southern Desert, it is much, too, to be wished that we could link up any concession about Banaiyan with the question of the Koweit blockade, but the Foreign Office, so far as I can judge, would be likely to reply to any attempt to do this that a concession about BanaiyanWould hardly do more than purchase a settlement regarding the Khor-al-Odeid and Qatar. 4. We have very little evidence as to the true position &amp;&amp; Banaiyan. we do not yet know what specific evidence the Saudis will put forward in support of their claims to it. But as time is short it seems well to fortify ourselves if possible by any information that can be secured from the Gulf. After discussion with Aar. Kendel and sir Andrew Ryan I therefore suggest that we should telegraph in the F~0 c-laa f i — terms of the draft attached, -which is, if is hoped, seIf-explanatory. If the Resident could give us some ! positive/4 - positive evidence in respect of the position of Atu Ddadi it would de very useful material against Fuaa am will help to stiffen the Foreign Office.

I need add little to my telegram No. 38 of the 21st February, but I feel bound to express, with great deference, my personal opmion thaf the indignation of His Majesty’s Government over the attitude of the Saudi Governinent has led them into an attitude on their side of undue severity towards Ibn Saud and Fuad Bey Hamza. a u' r?° 0116 J ias ei uphasised more than I Ibn Saud’s tendency to play to the Arab gallery. Nevertheless, I think it is hardly fair to suggest that he is asking His Majesty s Government to abandon their established policy in the Persian Gull in order that ne may play to the pan-Arab section of that gallery with greater enect. His resentment at the attitude of His Majesty’s Government regai ding his eastern and soutn-eastern frontiers is deep and genuine, but he has consistently disclaimed any wish to contest their position in regard to terri tories actually under the control of the coastal rulers. In so far as he wishes to disguise his acceptance of it, I think his position is that in certain ways he must dance to the tune of the pan-Arabs. I gather from a telegram which I have seen recently that the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs has taken a similar line about the position of the Arabs of Syria in regard to Franco-Iraqi negotiations. 3. Fuad Bey Hamza is a bumptious young man, but, as I have frequently pointed out, he has two personalities, that of the Fuad who is personally imbued with sentiments of Arab nationalism and that of the Fuad who serves Ibn Saud, without enjoying his master’s entire confidence and without sharing all his master’s views, because he sees in him the best present embodiment of the Arab idea and perhaps the best provider of a career for Fuad Bey Hamza, a convinced nationalist, but at the same time a man of great ambitions. For the rest, Fuad Bey of tens speaks to me unofficially with a frankness which is sometimes useful and sometimes embarrassing. The nature of our relations is such that I would myself acquit him of impertinence, though not of indiscretion, in his language of the 20th January. Sobered by the vigour of my reaction and by the consciousness of his official responsibilities, he modified it very considerably the next day and still more on the 7th February when he had taken the King’s instructions. I do not think he will again invoke lightly the McMahon-Hussein correspondence. Should he do so, I will bear in mind the short answer in paragraph 3 of your telegram No. 29 of the 15th February. In the meanwhile I trust that the statement reproduced in my telegram No. 39 of the 21st February will have a good effect, though it will not eliminate the factor of Arab nationalist sentiment. 4. On a point of detail, I would observe that Fuad Bey did not describe the Arab and Moslem opinion of which he spoke on the 7th February (see para- /o/?, graph 4 of my telegram Nq^ 23 of the 9th February) as being unintelligent but as being ill-informed. Having myself spent nearly four years in Arabia before I began to understand the relations between His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Gulf rulers, some aspects of which still elude me, I should be sorry to regard ignorance on the subject as a sign of defective intelligence. 5. I have not thought it necessary to make a separate record of my conversa tion with Fuad Bey on the 20th February, as I have embodied all the essential points in my telegrams. When Fuad Bey reverted to his question as to the form which any settlement of the frontier question would take and whether the local [356 1—4]2 rulers would be in any way parties to it, I said that, in principle, my formal communication seemed to contain the answer, but added that I had not yet received instructions on the specific reply to be returned. Any settlement, I said could only be a settlement between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Government, but the question of what experts might be used, if necessary, was another matter. On my referring to what he had previously said (see para- l&lt;ncf graph 4 of my telegram No. 23of the 9th February) about the possible participation of local experts or a possible affirmation by the rulers of their wish to place them selves in the hands of His Majesty’s Government, Fuad Bey denied that he had made any definite suggestion. He had merely put the question, he said, and had told me what was in his mind when putting it. 6 . In this connexion, Fuad Bey referred to the past participation of repre sentatives of Iraq and Koweit in negotiations regarding the frontiers of those countries with Nejd. I observed that these negotiations had taken place during a transition period both as regards the status of the territories concerned and as regards the relations between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud. The latter had been placed on a completely normal international basis by the subsequent Treaty of Jedda of 1927, and the agreements between His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Gulf rulers had been officially communicated to the King after the conclusion of that treaty. Haying got so far, Fuad Bey and I agreed to postpone further discussion ot the question of the eastern frontiers until I should have further instructions We went on to the questions of the Koweit blockade and Bahrein transit dues on which I have reported separately by telegraph. t am sendin g copies of this despatch to his Excellency the Viceroy of India (Foreign and Political Department) and to the Honourable the Political Kesident m the Persian Gulf, Bushire.

We on wifdwtfW 1 ’ 6 su ^ ) J? c . t ^e Proposed negotiations, as I was anxious to get of thp twn r\ . l J smess which has been accumulating. I reminded him, however, of the two definite questions which I had put on the 21st January. He countered by asking me whether I could reply to what he on his side had said about Koweit and Bahrein. I explained that His Majesty’s Government were actively con si ermg oth these subjects, but that I had not as yet received definite instructions. We agreed to revert to my own two questions to-day. r n m .°. rn i n g huad Bey made a statement in reply to my first question. i.e., whether his Government were prepared to enter on comprehensive negotiations on the basis which had been proposed. He reminded me that this proposal had originated in a suggestion made by himself in our conversations last June. The Saudi-Yemen settlement had just been effected, and he had approached me as to the possibility of discussions with a view to a co-ordination of British and Saudi policy, having regard to possible future contingencies in other directions. He again dwelt on the advantages which might ensue from such a co-ordination of policy. His Majesty’s Government were at present on good terms with all the Powers in the Near and Middle East, his enumeration of which included Russia. No one could foresee, however, what less happy developments might occur at any moment. The peace of Europe had been threatened twice in the recent past, after the assassinations of Herr Dollfuss and the Marseilles crime. 3. Having thus defined the nature of the original Saudi approach, Fuad Bey suggested that His Majesty’s Government had given a different turn to the matter by concentrating on questions outstanding between them and the Saudi Government. 4. I admitted this substantial accuracy of what Fuad Bey had said, but I reminded him of two things. The London conversations had fallen into two parts, even though the second, i.e., the discussion of outstanding questions, might have proved greater in actual volume than the first. The first part had related to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the suggested rapproche ment between Saudi Arabia and Iraq and towards the possibility of similar rapprochements with other Arab States. A straightforward reply had been given regarding the rapprochement with Iraq. His enquiry about other rapprochements had been couched in very general terms, and 'the reply had been guarded for a very good reason. What were those other Arab States? There had just been a very close rapprochement with the Temen. Wh had discussed the possibility of one with Iraq separately. There had been a recent treaty settlement between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan, which had produced good results. There remained Koweit, Bahrein, Qatar and the Tracial Sheikhdoms [356 d—4]and the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, all of which occupied special positions, though not all similar positions vis-a-vis His Majesty’s Government. As regards Koweit, His Majesty’s Government did, indeed, desire a rapprochement, but one of an economic rather than a political nature. They would not wish to see Koweit become a satellite of Saudi Arabia. Bahrein was an island State, and the question of its relations with Saudi Arabia was again an economic question, not, in my opinion, difficult of solution. Our position in regard to the Trucial Sheikhdoms was again of a special nature, for, while we had charge of their foreign relations, we concerned ourselves very little with their internal affairs. The Sultanate of Muscat and Oman was definitely independent, though bound to us by economic considerations. 5 . Fuad Bey asked whether there was not another independent State in the hinterland governed by an Imam. I said that I knew much less about Muscat and Oman than about any other part of Arabia and could not pronounce upon this. There was a personage known as the Imam and his position had varied, but I rather thought he would fall to be regarded as a frequently recalcitrant subject of the Sultan. I was careful to stress the fact that I could speak with no authority about Muscat and Oman. 6 . My second comment on Fuad Bey’s statement so far was a reminder that,, when we had discussed his suggestion in June, I had been authorised to make a statement, the terms of which were not fresh in my memory, but the general effect of which was that, if the important questions outstanding between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Government could be settled, means might be found to affirm in some appropriate manner the special friendship between them. (I find that on this point my memory misled me. I had in mind Foreign Office telegram No. 127 of the 10th July last regarding the line to be taken during my visit to Taif. Paragraph 6 of‘that telegram did not instruct me to make a statement, but authorised me in cautious terms to proceed on the assumption indicated in it. It was not, therefore, to Fuad Bey that I spoke of closer friendship, but to the King at Taif, and to him only in very general terms (see paragraph 2 of my telegram No. 166 of the 15th July last, and paragraph 6 of the detailed record of my conversations at Taif).) 7. Fuad Bey, proceeding with his statement, assured me on behalf of the King of his desire for the friendliest relations with His Majesty’s Government, who, though they had not made him what he was, had contributed much to his rise by their past attitude. His Majesty had suggested a co-ordination of policy. He would not enforce on His Majesty’s Government his view as to the advantages of this. It was for them to decide, but if there were to be negotiations for a comprehensive settlement of outstanding questions, he feared that any failure of i such negotiations might create a false impression. He would, therefore, prefer that the questions should be discussed, as had been done previously, separately ’ and each on its individual merits. 8 . I promised to convey this to His Majesty’s Government. I observed that the principal reason for proposing comprehensive negotiations was that they would have enabled His Majesty’s Government to offer certain concessions in connexion with the most difficult question of all, that of the eastern and south eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia, in consideration of a satisfactory settlement of other questions. 9. I ran over the questions which might have come into the proposed general negotiations. The most important was that of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers. Next in importance, and first in urgency, was that of the Koweit blockade, about which the Sheikh of Koweit, for all his personal friendship with Ibn Sand, felt very sore, and which His Majesty’s Government wore most anxious to get settled. As for the Bahrein transit question, it was, as I had said, one which in my opinion could be settled easily by some adjustment limited to a term of years. It had been envenomed by a single incident, that of the Ahmedi. If the local conference failed, I should be able to disabuse the Saudi Government of any impressions which that incident had suggested regarding the policy of His Majesty’s Government. I indicated in general terms the nature of the reassurance which I should be in a position to give. Then there was the question of slavery. I divided the remaining questions discussed in London into those which would clearly be outside the scope of comprehensive negotiations and some which might or might not be included, e.g., the Transjordan frontier question. Finally, I mentioned the future of the Treaty of Jedda, as a matter which had3 f? Pi ,K 0rid ° n ’ f but j Which ’ exce P t as regards the question of the considered separate^’ S t0 tUm ° n P articula r matters, which had been Hiffei°ntlv FUa wi?rA™! lmat{ ; d T that , he W0 ' 1 n d . P refer t0 P ut *6 last point rather difie y. His Government, I understood him to say, would approach particular questions with reference to their bearing on the position in regard to the Treaty of Jedda. I invited him to develop this, but something turned us aside and we did not pursue the subject. -n t ^ le S uest * on eastern and south-eastern frontiers, Fuad Bey asked what form the settlement of it would take. What would be the position of the rulers affected? Would they have any part in the discussion? He assured me on behalf of the King that His Majesty had no desire to intervene m any relations between His Majesty’s Government and the rulers, but the Kino- had to considei the effect on Arab and Moslem opinion, if he did anything which might be thought to place the rulers in a condition of inferiority, which, as a result of some elucidation, I took to mean that the King was afraid of appearing to let his fellow-Arab rulers down by disregarding their position as such and (to quote a word actually used by Fuad Bey) “ selling ” them to Great Britain. He referred to the participation of Iraqi delegates in the settlement of the Nejd-Iraq frontier question, while Iraq was still under a British mandate. 12 . I said that His Majesty’s Government had never approached the present subject otherwise than as a question of determining as between themselves and Ibn Saud the boundary between his territory and an area beyond it, in which they and the local rulers were alone concerned. The real trouble was, I suggested, that the King was unwilling to admit openly the position of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the area under discussion. That position, however, rested on a long historical evolution and a system of treaties by which the rulers themselves had placed themselves, so far as foreign affairs were concerned, in the hands of His Majesty’s Government. If Fuad Bey spoke of Arab brethren, I could retort by speaking of our Arab children. 13. Fuad Bey admitted the substantial truth of what I said. He suggested that the Arab and Moslem opinion which the King had in mind was very ill- informed. He suggested that some means should be found to make the position clear, e.g., by having the rulers represented in any negotiation, by experts, for instance, or obtaining from them some affirmation of the fact that they wished to be represented by His Majesty’s Government. 14. I said that I myself could see what was in the King’s mind, but intimated that His Majesty’s Government would have the greatest difficulty in proceeding on any theory other than that which I had described (see the first sentence of the last paragraph but one). I said that I must reflect and consult His Majesty’s Government. I intimated that, if in the circumstances he preferred to postpone an answer to my second question of the 21st January regarding Ibn Baud’s desiderata, I should not press it at the moment. He said he would prefer to wait. . 15. I am recording separately a short passage m the conversation relative to the Transjordan frontier. It did not bear on the essential features of that question, and I did not wish to advert to them without further instructions from His Majesty’s Government. . ,. 16. Fuad Bey gave me a definite message from the King, reaffirming his friendly dispositions and his sincere desire for a settlement of all questions between him and His Majesty’s Government, no matter how they were approached. I said that I welcomed this assurance and echoed it, saying that, in doins- so T could sneak for His Majesty’s Government as well as for myself. 17. ’ Finally, I told Fuad Bey that I had just received instructions (Foreign Office telegram No 23 of the 6 th February) which would enable me to state the views of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the Koweit business. I wished, however to look up certain previous papers before making the communication. bowTAS^ationGhoughmorecoheient^^yl^e^^ Tfosd Bov was intcrsnersed with digressions and trivialities, which I need not reproduce Othei’wise this is as accurate a record as I can make of the mam course of the conversation.

I am reporting separately on the only matter of business, about which I spoke to him that day, viz., the Amir Baud’s projected visit to England. 3. Sheikh Hafiz called on me yesterday afternoon, at his own suggestion to talk over matters of common interest. I enclose a record giving the gist of a long tete-d-tete conversation. The sheikh was at a disadvantage owing to his imperfect knowledge of English, and, as you know, he requires a good deal of drawing out. Much of what he said was nevertheless of great interest, especially as affording evidence, independent of that of Fuad Bey Hamza, of what is the King’s mind. If he has a fault, it is that he is apt in conversations of this kind to minimise difficulties and give play to his own conciliatory sentiments. His whole attitude was very friendly, and he expressed his firm conviction that the interest of Saudi Arabia lay in good relations with Great Britain. 4. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba left for Port Sudan and Egypt, en route for London, by the Egyptian steamship Kawthar this morning. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to his Excellency the Viceroy of India, Foreign and Political Department, the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire and His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Transjordan at Jerusalem. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure in No. 1 . Questions outstanding between His Majesty's Government and the Saudi Government. SHEIKH HAFIZ WAHBA called on me this afternoon and we had a longish general conversation. I understood him to say that the King had asked him to see me on his way through. He said more explicitly that when the question had arisen of his taking part in conversations here, in conjunction with Euad Bey, he had demurred, because he felt that he could do more in case of difficulty by coming in on the questions in London than if he were involved in difficulties arising in the course of discussions conducted jointly by Fuad Bey and himself. (All his references to Fuad Bey throughout were correct but not cordial. He doubtless knows that I know that he detests Fuad.) [356 d—5] \i r 2. I said 1 understood that the King was opposed to the idea of general negotiations. Sheikh Hafiz confirmed this. I said that I was in communication with His Majesty’s Government. My own view, I explained, was that general negotiations would have been useful, because they might have facilitated a settlement of the question of the eastern frontiers. Otherwise I was not sure that it mattered very much. r 3. When we approached particular questions, Sheikh Hafiz mentioned Bahrein. I explained the present position. I mentioned the fact that His Majesty’s Government had preferred not to over-elaborate the agenda, but had indicated two main heads, putting the question of direct shipments to Hasa first. If the local conference took place, it would be possible to disabuse the Saudi Government of false fears regarding our attitude, fears which had envenomed a question, the settlement of which did not otherwise appear to me to present insuperable difficulties. 4. In the course of our conversation about Bahrein transit, I asked Sheikh Hafiz whether he could tell me privately about the position of Muhammad-at-Tawil. I explained that, while it was not for us to suggest a Saudi representative at the local conference, we had always hoped that Tawil might be employed, as he understood the business and knew the people of Bahrein. I now heard rumours of two kinds, viz., that Tawil had quarrelled violently with Ibn Jiluwi and that there was friction between him and the California Arabian Standard Oil representatives. It was said that the trouble was the real reason for the despatch of the Deputy Minister of Finance and Khalid-al-Qarqani to Hasa. These things, I said, did not concern me but 1 wondered whether they might affect the possibility of Tawil being employed for the Bahreih Transit Conference. Sheikh Hafiz denied the rumour of a quarrel between Tawil and Ibn Jiluwi. He admitted vaguely that there was some other trouble, but did not think it would affect the Bahrein negotiations. (As a matter o± tact, 1 know from Standard Oil sources that there has been much friction e ween an d the company s representatives. The companv’s agent here seems to think that business concerning their affairs will be taken out of Tawil’s hands, but that he will retain his other functions) m S A* kh Hafiz ^ated that the thought the King would be prepared to ^Vin^awsv Jl TTt lT 1 ? Ue ! tlC ’, n ° f J the eastern fronti ers.

Sheikh Hafiz told me secretly that arrangements had been made for Fuad Bey to reside in Jedda and that they would take effect after the pilgrimage (I did not disclose the fact that luad Bey had confided to me the same secret). 10 . On my turning to other questions, Sheikh Hafiz mentioned the Hejaz Railway. 1 said that this was well m hand, and that I foresaw no difficulty in establishing the bases of a technical conference, as proposed by his Government 11 . Sheikh Hafiz referred to the future of the Treaty of Jedda. I asked what was the King’s outlook. Sheikh Hafiz said that His Majesty would like some modification, but in regard to a very limited number of points only, in fact only the question of language and slavery. I said that the question of slavery might be very difficult. Sheikh Hafiz said that he thought the King would be prepared to create a special court to deal with slave cases, but he did not know the details of this proposal. 12. I mentioned the Transjordan frontier, but spoke guardedly, explaining that I was not conversant with all the aspects of the matter. There had been difficulties about Hazim, and there was now a fresh difficulty about Thaniyya Taraif, which I understood to be close to the southern end of the Transjordan- Nejd boundary close to where the Transjordan-Hejaz boundary turned off. As regards the latter, I said there was one thing I did not quite understand. Fuad Bey had said in London that unless the Aqaba Maan question could be settled, the Saudi Government would prefer to have no discussion at all about the Transjordan-Hejaz frontier. The Aqaba Maan question was insoluble, but I did not see why we should not try to overcome practical difficulties in regard to the de facto frontier, just as we might try to overcome practical difficulties in regard to the legal Transjordan-Nejd boundary. Sheikh Hafiz intimated that the King did not wish to reopen the Aqaba Maan question, but he did not take my point about the de facto frontier. On my asking whether he thought it would be worth while to try and clear up difficulties in regard to the Transjordan-Nejd frontier on the ground, he replied with some emphasis in the affirmative. 13. Towards the end, Sheikh Hafiz observed that his was a small Government. They had come out of the desert and were unversed in diplomacy. I suggested that they sometimes wanted to rush ahead too fast, as if they were for all practical purposes, as they unquestionably were in the legal sense, in the same position as European Powers. I gave as an instance controversy over the Government of India dispensaries and expounded my views at some length, stressing the fact that the Government of India were satisfying a great need which the Saudi Government were at present unable to meet. I had aimed at maintaining the present position, subject to certain arrangements which would show respect for the position of the Saudi Government. I was all for collaboration with the Saudi medical authorities, but saw great objection to their exercising effective control. Sheikh Flafiz was generally sympathetic towards my point of view, and expressed the hope that the matter could be settled easily4 enough with Fuad Bey. He attributed the trouble a good deal to personal ill-feeling between the Director-General of Public Health and the Indian doctors. I urged that such feeling, if it existed, should not be allowed to imperil a work which benefited pilgrims and incidentally large numbers of Saudi subjects. It was not, I said, in the interests of the Saudi Government themselves to do anything which might discourage pilgrims from coming to this country. 14. As he was leaving, I observed to Sheikh Hafiz that I was getting on if 1 life and might be leaving Jedda, say, in one, two or three years. I was anxious to get questions settled. Sheikh Hafiz echoed my wish and renewed promises, which he had given me earlier and which I had welcomed, of his genuine desire to help.

The Government of India in their telegram of 4th Kay perhaps look at this question from a rather local point of view, it is likely to be very difficult to reach a wholly limited agreement the effect of which would be to prevent Ibn Saud from encroaching east of the Green Line to the North of Banaiyan, and the matter in dispute between us and him is the applicability of the Blue Line and the Violet Line of the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913A4. He has made extensive claims in the south (which, it is true, directly concern the colonial Office rather than the Government of India) which cannot be overlooked and the only tidy way of dealing with this question seems to be on the lines which have been accepted hitherto, viz. to make a general territorial settlement on the basis of greater or less concessions on the part of H.Iv„g. in respect of the central Desert, on this last Point the Government of India are, of course, right in saying that there is no special harm in raking concessions a wateriess desert.

There is no evidence of his having any rights or permanent in fluence to the east of this line greater or as great as that of any of the other rulers concerned, and there are other serious objections to allowing Ibn Sand to acquire such rights or influence there, 1 ou should not however allow yourself to be drawn into argument on this point and if this third offer fails to satisfy the King it will probably be necessary to suspend the negotiations. Conse quently, while appreciating the point in paragraph one of your telegram Ho. 89 ,/ of April 10th/, I consider that, unless agreement is in sight this concession should only be offered very cautiously. In possible event of negotia tions not leading to early result their subsequent resumption would be on basis of position reached at end of present discussions, and if the concession to meridian 53 is offered now without result, we shall have lost our last concession for purposes of future bargaining. 7 . ns you are aware and have yourself advised,there are strongest objections to allowing Ibn Saud to acquire access to the sea on the eastern side of the Qatar Peninsula or to establish a position for himself as one of the frucial Coast rulers, moreover territory claimed to east of 'green line' in this region has already keen recognised by His Ha jesty’s Government as belonging to the Sheikhs of Qatar and Abu Dhabi, His Majesty’s Government having formally recognised the rights of latter (wnich they have maintained against Turks) in Odeid and also in!;« . 4, Aqal (compare l.y ±s , a ' v&gt;lllce meinorandum B 430 enclosed in i 1 “ el ' S l8tter 01 I;::arcl! 15th, 1934).

Sheikhs of Qatar and of Abu Dhabi and Aden Protectorate will be repre sented in negotiations by His Majesty's Government,, Posi tion as regards pub cat is more difficult and has not yet oeen fully explored, but for your confidential information India Office would be prepared if necessary,and subject to consent of Government of India,to endeavour to obtain from Sultan authority for yourself or other British delegate to represent him. Addressed to Jedda No, 70, repeated to Government of India No, 55, Bushire No. o3 and Aden No, 34,SAUDI- ARABIAN BOUNDARIES ItU-. sUB-COMMITTEE had under consideration the following papers - Copy of letter from Mr e G.W. Rendel (Foreign Office) to Mr. J„G. DaithY^aite (India Office). (Paper No. M.E.(O) 180) 0 Copy of telegram from Sir Andrew Ryan^ His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda 3 to the Foreign Office.

Copies of telegrams from Sir Andrew Ryan 9 His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda* to the Foreign Office. (Paper No. M. L. ( 0 ) 183 ). MR. RENDEL explained that in trie absence of the Chairman on leave he had been ashed to take the Chair. He said that the papers which had been circulated fully explained the scope of to-day’s meeting 9 but I it might be advantageous if he briefly recapitulated the whole position. Saudi-Arsbian boundaries were last discussed at the 37th meeting of the Middle East Official Sub-Committee in connection with his letter to Mr. Laithwaite dated 7th November^1934 (circulated as Paper No. M.L.(O) 162). Following on this discussion., instructions had been issued to Sir Andrew Ryan in January 1935^ the substance of which was briefly as follows 2 in the first place to get a erear definition of Ibn Baud’s desiderata; secondly to offer Ibn Baud in full sovereignty the territory up to what was now known as the 'green line 1 ’ as shown on the sxetcn map circulated at the meeting. if this otier were not acceptable, to offer che creation of a special H dese-t zone', which would be bounded on the west by the 'green line' and on the north and east by the 'brown'' and'yellow lines shown on the sxetch map, the eastern limit running due south from the intersection of parallel 22° and meridian 55° to parallel 20.I -2- The southern limits of the 'desert zone' were still subject to discussion 9 but would approximately follow the southern limit of the Ore at Sands. In the last resort 9 and in order to secure their desiderata in other directions 9 His Majesty’s Government were prepared to concede a part of this desert zone as far east as meridian 52 h. which was shown on the map by a brown line? Ibn Baud to have full sovereignty in this area* subject to very limited servitudes. After these instructions had been issuedj further consultation had taxen place with the authorities at Aden regarding the southern boundaries of the 'desert zone' or of any concession to be offered to Ibn baud and it now seemed clear that the tribes of the Hadramaut (in the Aden Protectorate) extended at the western end of the line at least as far north as parallel 18. On the assumption that the south-east corner of the 'desert zone' would be the intersection of parallel 20 with meridian 669 the Aden authorities had suggested that the best line for the southern limit of the concessions to be offered to Ibn Baud would be a straight line run ning from the intersection of parallel 18 with the so-called violet line to the intersection of parallel 20 with meridian 55. The effect cl all this was to reduce the 'desert zone' to a very small area 9 more especially in the certain event of its proving necessary to olfer Ibn Baud the con cession up to meridian 52 east referred to aboee. In these circumstances the foreign Oil ice were wondering whetner io was still really worth while embarking on the comolicated procedure of the 'desert zone' which Ibn baud3 - which 'would, certainly be unities^ for so very small an area. He understood that the India Office were inclined whether it would not now be better to abandon the whole idea of the desert zone and the system of servitudes and to proceed by offering ibn Saud as the next step the territory up to meridian 5‘d (i.e. what was originally discussed 9 the India Office had been prepared to agree to ox the desert zone were now to be dropped perhaps it might be possible to agree to this line being taxen at least to that meridian. Ibn Saud a complete concession* involving full sovereignty as far east as possible. The first two stages J.n the instructions to Sir Andrew/* i.e.* the statement of Ibr: Saud T s desiderata and the offer in full sovereignty to Ibn Saud of the territory up to the green line* had been realised. The next stage would be to offer Ibn Saud the territory up to the brown line* as shown on the map* or preferably up to meridian 53. He understood that the India Office were on the -whole in favour of offering these concessions step by step and negotiating by a process of bargaining* not granting the maximum concession at the outset. It would be for the India Office to develop this view* but it seemed open to intended ac the 1 inal concession referred to above)* adding to this any further concession in full sovereignty that might be practical. When this line had originally been The first point for the Committee to consider was whether or not we should abandon the desert zone and givequestion 'whotiler tills was really tlie wisest policy. if concessions were extracted, fpom us one by one after much, bai gaining they might well acquire a greater value 3 and. our eventual agreement to them might well be represented as more of a defeat than if we made our offers more easily and more completely in the first instance and stuck to them more firmly. MR. LAITHWAITE said that the India Office views proceeded on the assumption that there could be no question of any further concession to Ibn Baud in the North beyond that shown by the green and the brown lines at Meridian 52 respectively. Subject to this they agreed with the procedure now suggested by the Foreign Office^ viz. that the idea of the desert zone should be abandoned and that in dealing with Ibn Baud we should negotiate in three stages i (1) up to the green line; (2) brown line to Meridian 52; and (3) if necessary 9 an extension of the brown line up to Meridian 55 9 on the understanding that this would be the ultimate concession. The effect y/ould be that we should be laying down a fixed desert frontier shown on the map between Saudi Arabia and our proteges. He would like in this connection to refer to one or two other points. In the first place 9 as regards the Southern boundary of Qatar 9 which was a question of considerable interest to the Defence Departments 9 the India Office were of opinion that the boundary which had been agreed last year between the Departments and which ran in a South-Eastern direction from the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay south of Salwa and Sakak to the North of the Khor-al-Odeid should be maintained. - 4 -becondly 9 it had throughout been assumed that there could be no question of aliovving Ibn Saud to obtain any outlet on the coast in trie vicinity of the hhor-al-Odeido In any case His ' Majesty’s Government had recognised tne Odeid district as be longing to Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi had also a good historical claim* which appeared to have been recognised by His Majesty’s Government to Aqal. On the question of tactics he was open to conviction. But the India Office in the light of their experience in negotiations of this type remained of opinion that it would be a mistake to capitulate too quickly to Ibn band’s demands and that it would be best that the Minister should continue to play a close game with him. The concessions we were making were* in fact* very sub stantial. Moreover if* after intimating to Ibn Saud that we re garded the blue and violet lines as regally binding upon him we first offered him a not unimportant concession up to the present green line* and* immediately on hearing that such concession was unacceptable to him* proceeded without any further delay to make he was not sure that Ibn Saud would not think that we had trie^ to bluff him in the earlier stage. Anorhor point of importance was that if negotiations broke down and theie was any question of reopening them after an interval* they would be resumed at the stage at which they had been left and if at that stage we had already reached our maximum concession it would clearly oe much more difficult to reopen them with any hope of success. much more difficult to reop r THE OHAIRMAH agreed generally with the India Oil ice vifcw as regards the northern end of tne line. It was clearly impossible to give I’on Saud any part of the coast to the east of the Qatar Peninsular. In the first place we were view as already committed to regarding the portion of the coast which Ibn Saud had assed for as belonging to Abu Dhabi. Secondly, if ibn Saud were to establish himself on the Trucial Coast with very inconvenient consequences. oir a. rq an himself always attached the greatest importance to Ibn Saud Sir A. Ryan had himself alwaysIn not being allowed to reach the coast east of Qatar 6 In any case it was agreed that the whole of the Xhor-al-Odeid and the land immediately behind it 5 and the whole of the area as far as Banaiyan (which was an essential key point) in the south-west belonged to Abu Dhabi and could not under any circumstances be given to Ibn Baud. But the more firmly we took our stand in regard to this northern area the more desirable it seemed that we should be as generous as possible in the east. MR. BLAXTDR said that the Colonial Office view was very similar to that expressed by the Foreign Office and India Office. He agreed that we should abandon proposals for the creation of a desert zone. The Colonial Office were mainly concerned with the delineation of the southern boundary^ referred to in Aden telegram Ho. 19. (circulated as Paper Ho. M. 1 .( 0 ) 18C) 3 and shown on the map as a broken yellow line. He understood that it was not proposed to grant any concession south of this line. WIHG COMMAHDBR PIRIB said that the Air Ministry were only concerned in this question in so far as it affected Qatar 3 and they had already expressed their views on this subject to the Foreign Office. He asxed if it 'was known how far south the authority of Abu Dhabi extended. MR. LAITHT/AITE said that the Sheikh was known to claim Khufah and Liwah and that he did not appear iiO recognise Saudi authority to the East of the green line. He thought 9 however 3 that the northern limits of our concessions to Ibn Sand must run well to the South of any territory under the effective jurisdiction of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. One reason for this was in order to give the Air Force plenty of room ip which to operate between the Southern limits of any oil concession which mighu be granted in the future in Abu Dhabi territory and trie Hortnern bounoary of the territory of Saudi Arabia.THL CHAIRMAN said that there see.tied no insuperable objection to carrying'tne line due east from a point south of Banaiyan* instead of south-east as shown on the map. MR. LAI TIMA ITS pointed out that it would be better to keeo this line as far as possible from the coast. In reply to a question from Ring Commander Pirie ? referring to co-terminous frontiers* THE CHAIRMAN said that the tact that the frontier originally proposed would be between Saudi-Arabia and a no-man’s land constituted the great weakness in our case. If we could claim the area on the other side of the frontier for tribes unaer our protection we should be in a far stronger position* but as the legal i-s.dvisers to the foreign Cmfice hod explained last autumn* it was impossible for us to tame a really firm line about frontiers against a vacuum* and it was clear that Ibn baud realised tni« point. He than referred to the question of how the pro posed frontier should be defined in any agreement with Ibn Sand. He pointed out that it might be possible to lay down in the eventual instrument such and sucn a line as being that which His Majesty’s Government recognised as the frontier oi Saudi-Arabia* and ibn Baud might then be persuaded to agree to renounce ail rights beyond that frontier in much the same way as the Turks had renounced ail rights outside tne - 7 -newly defined frontier of Turkey Toy Article AVI of the Treaty of Lausanne 0 This was not a very satisfactory metnod and left much uncertainty about the area outside the frontier, Tout it might at least avoid awkward questions about the status of the territory on the other side of the frontier and avoid the necessity of our having to negotiate with Ibn Sand .on behalf of Muscat, MR. LAITH1AIT3 said that he did not think that the India Office would object to a definition of the frontier as being a frontier between Saudi Arabia on the one side and the Sheikhdoms etc. in geographical order on the other. This would, however, be on the clear understanding that there could be no Question of Qatar or Abu Dhabi being formally mentioned as consenting parties or formally associated with the negotiations. Their foreign relations were in the hands of His Majesty’s Government and it was most important not to compromise this position in any way. Muscat was in a different position and, subject to the views of the Resident and the Government of India, he thought that the India Office would not see objection to its being party to the negotiations or at any rate a signatory of any treaty. The ideal, if Muscat had to be brought in, would be that the Sultan should be persuaded to appoint Sir A. Ryan or some other British officer as his representative and not to produce a representative himself. The actual boundary to be appended to any treaty could be based on co—oru-^na ues. MR. SEAL was not sure why v/e were proceeding with these negotiations. When the boundary question had been considered originally it had been part of a general settlement with a view to getting a .quid ..pro—gun. Ve now seemed to be giving more territory away and to be getting nothing in return.TnE CjiAIBiVIAI! explained in reply that when this question had originally arisen it had done so in an acute form (in connection with the American oil concession in Hasa) and it had 'been clear that an early settlement was necessary. We had been prepared to take our stand on the so-called blue and violet lines ? and it had looked as though we might be making an important concession to Ibn Baud and getting nothing in return,, with consequent loss of prestige. The suggestion that the matter should be dealt with as part of a general comprehensive settlement had been intended to make it easier for us to make this concessions as we should then be obtaining advantages elsewhere which could be set off against it. It was now clear that Ibn Baud was not likely to regard our concessions to him in this area as at all generous. In fact we should have great difficulty in getting him to accept them. The question of a q uid pro quo in return for these concessions had therefore lost its reality and there was no reason why this frontier question should not be dealt with independently and on its merits 9 since we should certainly not be regarded as having been over generous to Ibn Baud in any concessions that we might make. But the question was still one of great urgency. We now knew that our legal position was weak and unless some settlement were reached there might be great difficulty with foreign oil concessionnaires 9 etc.* in Ibn Baud’s dominions. Moreover 5 if no limits were agreed upon as bounding Ibn baud s authority 3 he would certainly continue to extend that authority and might well establish claims which it would be much more difficult for us to resist later on, L ' dear therefore, that the best way of setting a limit to Ibn Baud’s expansion towards the Trucial Coast and generally m eastern Arabia was to agree as soon as possible on some definite boundary line.-10- MR. LAITHEWAITE said that the Secretary of State for India would certainly not agree to any concession further cast than that already suggested, i.e., meridian 53 . in reply to a question from Ring Commander Pirie as to how we could justify refusing to make any concession to Ihn Saud to the East of meridian 55, he said that the short answer to this was that so far as could he judged from the explora tions of Mr. Bertram Thomas, Ihn Saud’s writ did not run to the east of the green line. It was most important not formally to recognise the Saudi position further east than we could possibly help. j-Ilui CHAIRMAN, in reply to a further question, explained that the position as regards the authority of the Trucial Sheikhs in the hinterland was uncertain. Ihn Saud had extended his influence very considerably and had within the last few years greatly strengthened his claims by establish ing colonies of Akhwan in areas between the Blue and Green lines where his rights had not previously existed but were not now contested.. It was not possible to disregard the claims he had. thus established, but if a bound.ary were now ^ # ' # agreed upon we should know how we stood and be in a stronger position for contesting any claims he had tried to establish beyond that boundary. MR. SEAL said that he did not see how Ibn Saud could en force his claims to areas to the east of the blue and violet lines. He had certainly placed a few settlements in some of this territory, but as he was not a member of the League of Nations he could not force us to recognise him as sovereign of any area to which his title must be based upon occupation of hitherto unappropriated territory. A claim of this nature must, especially in a country such as Arabia, inevitably be of such an indeterminate character that we could, ignore it, or, if necessary, establish a counter claim, in rebutting which Ibn Saud would be gravely hampered by the Blue Line Treaty.THE CHAIRMAN explained that Ibn Saud might well have a strong case against us if the boundaries were not defined, and that it would be necessary in such an event for us to be able to produce sene answer. Ibn Saud’s advisers were quite clevei enough to realise that if they could produce an un answerable case it would be ?/orth Ibn Saud r s while to demand arbitration. In any case Ministers had already decided in favour of trying to reach an agreement with Ibn Saud about these south-eastern frontiers, and it would be unfortunate if this major question of principle had now to be re-opened, unless it were clear that no agreement with Ibn Saud could be reached. He suggested that the meeting should proceed on the basis that an agreement about the frontiers was desirable and should be aimed at. MAJOR OSBORNE asked why it was not possible to grant Ibn Saud territory up to meridian 56. The War Office had always been of opinion that in our settlement with Ibn Saud we should be as generous as possible. We could hardly expect Ibn Saud to renounce claims in the north where there was a possibility of discovering oil unless we were prepared to grant him a generous concession in the east. He enquired whether the eastern boundary could not run along meridian 56 E. THE CHAIRMAN said that the Foreign Office entirely agreed with the War Office that we ought to be as generous as possible to Ibn Saud over these frontiers, and, in view of the fact that it was necessary for us to take up an attitude of firm opposition towards his claims in the north, he felt that it would be good policy to be as generous as we could in the extreme east* The northern and southern limits of the propos ed concessions were now agreed upon and could not be extended, but, speaking personally, he would like to see the concessions between those limits carried as far to the east as possible. On the other hand, he did not see how Ibn Saud could reason ably put forward any kind of claim as far east as meridian 56, and there would be considerable dangers in giving him in full sovereignty stretches of territory over which he exercised noeffective contrel. Mr, ThoraRs, travelling along meridllan 51, had indeed hardly come within Itn Sand’s authority:' But': speahing per sonally, he would have liked to see the limit carried at least as far east as meridian 54, In view of the India Office attitude, ' however, he did not wish at present to press for any concession ^further east than meradian 53 , WING COMMANDER PIRIE asked how we were prepared to meet Ibn Sand’s arguments that this territory did not belong to Muscat. THE CHAIRMAN thought it would be possible to inform Ibn Sand that we considered meridian. .53 to be a reasonable line. It was of course an entirely artificial line, since no-one exercised any effective control in this area. But it represented a reasonable division between the areas ever which Ibn Sand might extend his authority and those which would naturally fall within the authority of Muscat. Neither this line nor any of the others would of course be frontiers in the European sense, but they would represent ulti mate limits beyond which no claims would be recognised. It was clearly necessary to have seme such limits somewhere, particularly no?/ that mineral concessions, etc. , were being granted. MR. BRIDGES said that as the green line appeared to be the effective limit of Ibn Saud’s sovereignty it was much harder to I justify demarcation of the boundary along meridian 53 or 54 E. THE CHAIRMAN suggested that the meeting should agree to the issue of revised instructions to Sir A* Ryan 0 These could be to the effect that His Majesty’s Government had now decided to abandon the whole idea of the desert zone and the system of servitudes, and to offer the so-called bro?/n line concession (i.e., up to meridian 52) as the next step. The northern and southern limits of this would have to be defined. Sir A. Ryan could be authorised then to offer Ibn Saud, in case of necessity, a further concession up to meridian 53, but he could make it clear that His Majesty’s Government would not recognise Ibn Saud’s claims further east than this. MR. LAITHWAITE said that the India Office were only prepared to agree to instructions which did not contemplate any negotiation of the boundaries east cf meridian 53, which they considered should be the limit of Ibn Saud’s'sovereignty,. The situation might change very considerably in a few years’ time, in the event of Ibn Saud’s death. - 12 -THE GHAIRMAH, referring to the question of the boundary between the Aden Protectorate and the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman 9 said cnau it would be very useful if 9 within the next few weeks 3 information could be obtained from the Aden Protectorate indicating how far east this boundary could be taken. In a recent telegram from Aden it had been stated that the boundary ran north-eastwards from the sea at Has Dharbat Ali. This might mean that the whole of the southern boundary of the proposed concession to Saudi-Arabia would be co terminous with the Aden Protectorate ? which would be satisfactory. After further discussion it vms agreed that the northern limit of the bro 1 n line should be a line running from the green line, five miles south of Banaiyan due east to meridian 52 E. for the first stage, and for the second stage, a continuation of this line running to meridian 53 E; the southern limits of the brown line to be from the intersection of parallel 18 and the violet line to the intersection of parallel 19 and meridian 52 for the first scagej this line to be prolonged to meridian 53 for the second stage. CONCLUSION . THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed:- That the Foreign Office should draft new instructions to Sir Andrew Ryan, welch should be concurred in by the Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry, India Office and Colonial Office before despatch, and should include the ioilowing poincs.— (a) that the proposal for a special_ desert zone and system of servitudes should be abandoned; (b) that the next stage should be to offer Ibn Saud in full sovereignty a concession up to the brown line, i.e. the area bounded on the west by the green line, the north by a line from the green line five miles south of Banaiyan due east to meridian 52, thence due south to parallel 19, thence to the intersection of parallel 18 with the violet line; -13T v if agreement with Ihn Sand on this area could not he reached ? then this concession should he extended to the easterly Units of meridian 55 E; (d) these instructions should include the question of the method of describing the frontier 9 i.e. ? the frontier between Saudi--Arabia,, Qatar 9 Abu Dhabi 5 Muscat and the Aden Protectorate an effort will be made if necessary to persuade the Sultan of Muscat to authorise Sir A, Ryan to represent him in any negotiations with Ibn Saud. 2 ?

One of 1 the subjects to be discussed by Sir Andrew Ryan during his forthcoming visit to Riyadh is the question of defining the &amp;4 &lt;AV tik. frontiers between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, the Trucial Sheikhdoms, Muscat, the Hadramaut /flu* and the Aden Protectorate. After a considerable amount of interdepartmental discussion and consultation with the Government of India and the authorities in the Gulf definite instructions have now been issued to Sir Andrew Ryan as to the offer which he should make to Ibn Saud in this connection.

Sir Andrew Ayan is to make it absolutely clear that this is a final offer beyond which H.M.G. are not prepared to go.

Pf 1 8 NOV 19355 / Under Secretary of State, ^ Please see the last minute on P.Z,8115/35 and the telegram sent to the Resident in the Persian Gulf as a result of the Middle East Official Sub committee meeting on November 11th. 2. There were two main points to be settled: (1) The Sultan of Muscat was to be approached and the eastern frontier settled in the light of his advice; alignment of the northern frontier from point C eastwards. CdtA jj V'ttiAf /j Airt\ (1). The Sultan is in Dofar and not accessible and it is therefore impossible to consult him before Sir A. Ryan 1 s meeting with Ibn Saud. Colonel Fowle suggests what should be said to Ibn Saud. Unfortunately he adopts a completely new system of lettering which is inconsistent with that adopted by the Middle East Sub-Committee. The correct letters are, however, substituted in ink. 4, As regards (2), Colonel Fowle hopes to reply tomorrow, but as time is short the papers are submitted without waiting for the further telegram. r f'W'U atAr~LA*&lt; (2) Colonel Leah 1 s views were to be obtai-nod on the 3. We now have Colonel Fowle’s reply in regard to- 2 - 5. It is suggested that the follovdng line should be taken in discussing with the Foreign Office the instructions to be issued to Sir Andrew Ryan. The actual details of the instructions cannot, of course, be settled until we have Colonel Fowle’s further telegram. 6. Ibn Saud might be told that in regard to the eastern part of the frontier it is not possible to offer an absolutely definite line, in view of the fact that the Sultan of Muscat is at present away from his capital and cannot be informed of the stage at which H.M.G. have now arrived in their consideration of this matter or consulted as to the precise line which H.M.G. would suggest to represent the frontier between Saudi Arabia and Muscat CTb territory. There is, however, only one small area in which the line must be left indeterminate; the point G may be taken as fixed^and the point C, with a line running east cf it as far as Meridian 55, may also be taken as fixed. /In the light of Colonel Loch’s reply to the enquiry No.2 referred/I- U'‘ ' •' j referred to above, Ibn Saud would be infomed of the approximate point on Meridian 55 at which the line from C would intersect it7. It is, however, possible that the line might be taken in this neighbourhood a little to the east of Meridian 55, though not so far as Meridian 56 - for instance, to point E« Thence the line would rejoin the southern line at point G. It would be impressed on Ibn Saud that the final decision as to the limit to which Saudi territory could be recognised as extending in tnis area would be one for'the Sultan of Muscat, It t jto uld- cqu Thr, a rea--4n -ou^ta^rT was one (tdwuAA Uxt&lt;^ 4 .vely small that is comp a might, indeed, be je might more the GrSat Sands, though sumably desert.

Loch’s, and the proposed O' line would therefore proceed to a point^52° east and 23° north instead of to 53° east, 22° north, before turning easterly. This gives the Sabkhat Matti, Mijan (or most of it) and Sufuk to Abu Dhabi. Col. Fowle does not at all strongly support Col. Loch’s view that the other places further south and a long way from the coast claimed by Abu Dhabi should be allotted to him; (4) from point C it was agreed that at any rate the line CFG could be offered. The F.O., with the support of the W.O. and Air Ministry, were keen on extending f\ n (ILwkli LtLx * c/ Mr*'’ - this offer to the line C D E G. It was urged by these Depts. that the advantage of improving the prospect of a settlement with Ibn Saud justified the further concessionT / r in an area which is strategically of no impotance. On oar side we urged that on the eastern sector particularly it was desirable to keep in hand a margin of error m the event of possible Muscat claims. It was agreed that it was necessary at this stage in any case to inform the Sultan of Muscat of the state of the negotiations, and in view of the feeling in the Committee we agreed that at the same time the Sultan of Muscat should be consulted before a choice between the two alternatives (F G or DEG) was made, in order to ascertain whether any Muscat interests would be adversely affected by the latter alternative. &amp; luL » ^ In order to inform and consult the Sultan is 'F necessary, I am afraid, to send rather a long telegram to explain the origin and present stage of the negotiations.

The attached two sketch maps (of S.E.Arabia generally and of the area at the base of the Qatar Peninsula) attempt to show roughly the various lines now under consideration. First, as regards general considerations. (1; Death of Ibn Jiluwi. This should make Ibn Saud's hold over this area less firm. Colonel Fowle said in his telegram of 30th August (P.Z.6116/35) ''while we may admit that he (Ibn Saud) 1 b. s considerable influence over the (Murra) tribe at the moment, this influence is not of long standing and would, be cast off rapidly should his power wane or Ibn Jiluwi die'. The recent death of Ibn Jiluwi will therefore obviously affect the de facto position regarding tribal allegiance, which is one of the iactors to be taken into account in settling the limits of our final oifer to Ibn Saud, and is an argument for not going too far. it may also make Ibn Saud more ready to settle. (2) Our relations with Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. The fact that Colonel Loch has been over this- matter so carefully with fhe Sheikh and his advisers will make it very difficult for H.M.G. to adopt a line less favourable to the Sheikh without risking letting him down badly. (3) Our relations with the Sultan of Muscat. His Highness has never been consulted about these negotiations at all. it was sgsraed at the Middle East meeting on April 15th that if necessary the Sultan should be asked be asked to /n] to appoint Sir A.Eyan to act for Him in the negotiations, But the point has not been pursued, and we only have hearsay evidence (e.g. reports of an iniormal oonversation with the Political Agent a year ago)as to what the Sultan regards as his boundary. It is therefore important that we should not run any risk of making an offer to Ibn Saud which the Sultan would not agree to. Indeed it is for consideration whether he should not he informed at the present stage of what is being done, even if he is not formally asked to appoint Sir A. Ryan as negotiator for him. As regards the actual lin es, please see the maps, which show in pencil the four most recent lines, viz. the line agreed at the Middle East Committee on September 24th, of which the precise alignment was to depend on the reports to be received from the Gulf, the line proposed ^after the meeting^by Mr. Rendel (in his letter of 19th October) which meant pushing the Eastern part of the frontier from meridian 54 to meridian 55, the further line suggested by Mr. Rendel in his letter of November 4th, and the line suggested by Colonel Loch. The lines (except that of Colonel Loch) are of course very rough, since the key points on which they are based have not all been fixed. It seems best to take Colonel Loch’s line as a l SU\u. JT f'MeU &lt;*mIU rU ^ ti-lteHt** UaaJ~ a./4t« ^ basis, Sections 1 and 2 (the north end). The Green Line goes ’’from the head of the Dohat to a point five miles N.E. of Sekak” (this was meant to leave Salwa comfortably on the Saudi side). The line suggested by the Middle East Committee on 24th September was to start froiiTa point about 4 miles the Q.atar side of %asr Salwa - the actual point to be determined in the light of geographical features. Colonel Loch’s line starts just/Minute Paper Department. m ^ /y a a 'fi ■ ^ ^ c tt ^ //K * U&gt; /H^ h-.^^ f * ‘ MfU3 f just; by G u asr Sa.1v/a but lg miles east of tbe head of the Dohat Salwa. There does not seem to be very much in it, and the geographical divisions suggested by Colonel Loch seem convenient. The Foreign Office will however (aasi fy'^b ^ probably complain that it does not do what they wished to do, viz. give Ibn Saud a small concession in an area to which he attaches great importance. The matter is one in which the Air Ministry are concerned, and our attitude might turn partly on theirs. But unless there are really good reasons for not accepting Colonel Loch^^ line here, it seems desirable (in view of the fact that he has flown over the place and has worked it out with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi's aged uncle who no doubt is an expert) to take what Colonel Loch suggests. We need not however fight to the death over the point, as no essential interest of the Sheikh of Qatar is involved. Section (3), viz. from meridian 51 to Haluwain. On this section it is essential that we should stand*^^^^^ firm on Colonel Loch’s line for the reasons which he gives. The Foreign Office can have no complaint on this score, as Haluwain was mentioned, as a possible alternative to Dhuwaihin as ’Key point B’ in our telegram i A twv^l ^ 1 .*.

The Foreign Office appear to be quite ready to fix a Key point C so as to include Sufaj( very comfortably; Colonel Loch’s line does considerably more than that, and by comjarison with Colonel Dickson’s blue print map it will be seen that, as Colonel Fowle 2621 6000 3 34 says/in/ says, it outs off a piece (though not really a large piece) of the Murra Dira as colonel Dickson defines it. This is a difficulty as we are more or less committed to giving Ibn Baud the Murra Dira. On the othetfhand, it cannot be supposed that Colonel Dickson*s rough# nap is geographically precise, and the Abu Dhabi^i experts are quite as competent to say which particular wells are in the predominent use of their own tribesmen. There is therefore no real reason to suppose that by taking Colonize Loch’s line we shall be doing anything inconsistent with our decision to draw a line which will roughly give ibn Baud the Murra Dira (also it may be pointed out that we are giving him big slices of non-Murra Dira elsewhere). Moreover, the two general considerations, Dos.l and 2, mentioned at the beginning ofthis note are relevant in this connection. The balance of argument therefore seems definitely in favour of taking Colonel Loch's line - though it must be admitted that he might have produced more convincing arguments in favour of it. However, it will obviously be necessary to s ee what the general feeling of the Committee is on the point. As regards the Eastern part of the line, the •eign Office will no doubt press the suggestion to take s * the line to 55° 40’ instead of 55. In view of general consideration Ho.3 above, it seems undesirable to go any (du further than 55. Reference should be made to Mr.Rendel's remarks at Flag R in the minutes of the meeting on September 24th. While it is undesirable to hold Ibn Baud up against a large vacuum, there is no need to create a large vacuum on his side. There is no evidence of his exercising any authority up to or anywhere near meridian 55, and it is the present policy (except perhaps in the North where there is no room to turn round) to draw a i line somewhere between the effective sovereignties involved/ Ctuiu U , ^pi? ftiM&amp;d.'i Q KAT'!7 * ,! • -J—a, sma Minute Paper. Department. ■41 d !6 11,1 4^ 2621 6000 3 34 involved. Meridian 55 seems to be a perfectly good line for this purpose - being, if anything, no doubt, nearer to the Muscat effective authority than the Saudi. In any case the conclusive argument seems to be that we have no mandate irom the Sultan and must leave a margin in case there &amp;b trouble with him. The foregoing is the general kind of line that might perhaps be taken on Monday - but it will be necessary to see how the meeting develops and what line other departments take. I agree generally with Mr. Claason. It is suggested that we should adopt the following attitude. ^ a ' —hocLU ’s sectors 1 and 2 : If the Air Ministry see no objection, we might agree to the line which the F.Q. desire (because it gives a small concession to Ibn Baud in an area to which he attaches great importance) as far as meridian 51, but not as far as the end of the Sabkhat al Amra. (b) Sec tor, 3 : In view of the importance of this (see para. 2 of hi. Loch's telegram) we might seek to secure the adoption of his proposal, which is endorsed by Col. ^owle, viz ..• that when the line reaches meridian 51 it should turn more southerly to Haluwam. If the Committee will not agree to this, I might make a reservation for further submission (it might be desirable lo consult Col. Fowle again on the point before giving away more than Col. Loch recommends). Sector.^4: The reasons are not quite so strong as in the previous sector for securing for Abu Dhabi the/the places between Col. Loch’s line and that tentatively suggested last September, because these places are much farther away from the coast. If the Committee will not agree to Col- Loch's line here, we might agree uo the line suggested in September or that suggested by 7 r. Sendel in his letter of 19th October- In the last resort (but with reserve, in order to consult Col. Fovle again) we might even agree to 7 r. Renders last-moment suggestion of 4th ! ovember as far as meridian ob. (^) 2 V ' P sector : In order to have a margin vis.-a-xis. Unseat it would be preferable to -tick wo meridian 55. The final concession to Ibn Saad proposed last September was meridian 54; since then the 1*5. have agreed with the F.O. to 55; Mr. Rendel now wants to go as far as 55.40 (the F.O. have throughout consistently adopted squeeze tactics). We might propose to adhere to 55, and if the Committee want to go beyond this make a reservation in order that the Sultan of uscat may oe consulted.

(E 6449/77/91) 4th November, 1935. o IMPORTANT My dear Walton Many thanks for your letter P.Z. 7713/35 of 30th October summarising and commenting on your recent exchange of telegrams with India and Bushire on the question of the south-eastern Arabian boundaries. 2. I quite agree with your view that a treaty definition of the frontier as the edge of the Great Sands would be uncertain and unsatisfactory. Apart from our lack of accurate data as to where the eastern limit of the Sands actually runs, the Sands themselves may, as you point out, easily shift their position, or there may be areas where their precise limit is uncertain and where they have no sharply defined limit at all. Moreover, both in the south-western and north-eastern sectors of the line we are not prepared to recognise Ibn Saud’s authority as extending right up to the edge of the Sands in the south because our information shows that the Hadramauti tribes of the Aden Protectorate extend over the edge of the J.C. Walton, Esq., C.B., M.C.th.6 Sands for a depth, of some ten or twenty miles, while in the north-east, since the Sands appear in many places to come right down to the sea, we should be abandoning definitely Trucial territory. I agree therefore that in .the eastern and southern sector of the line we must - as Ibn Saud himself has done - rely on geographical coordinates. But I also agree with you that these coordinates can and should be so drawn as to take account of known geographical features, strategic requirements, tribal distribution, etc. There are however several places - and particularly the eastern and south-eastern sectors of the line - where the edge of the Sands, as far as we can estimate its true position from such maps as Thomas’s and Philby’s does seem to be a very relevant geographical factor. 3. On the other hand, I confess that I am very much impressed by the Government of India’s new suggestion that, “since the offer now to be made is to be considered “absolutely final, it might be worth going the whole hog “and conceding up to Meridian 56 as claimed oy Ibn Saud “for the eastern sector of the frontier , “. I do not mean by this that Meridian 56 is necessarily the best line. ButBut I do feel very strongly that the line we now offer should he one on which we can take our stand and which we can defend on the ground that the territory heyond it falls within the sphere of some non-Saudi ruler. You will remember that when I proposed in my letter of 19th October that we ought to take the eastern line to Meridian 55, I suggested that we might be able to defend this by arguing that the country to the east of it was steppe country falling altogether outside the region of the Great Sands and dependent on the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman. It seems to me that the information now contained in the telegrams summarised in your letter will make it extremely difficult to maintain this position, and that some further revision of our proposals in this area, before we commit ourselves to ’’an absolutely final offer” to Ibn Saud, may be very desirable. 4. While I agree that it is extremely tiresome to have to reopen this question in any way at so late a stage, it does seem to me that it will be far better to review it now while we still have time, so as to ensure ao far as possible that the position which Ryan takes up at Riyadh isis a sound one. than, for the sake of avoiding what is mainly a mechanical complication, to let instructions stand the soundness of which we now have new reason to doubt # 5. It seems to me that we shall he furnished with a very good opportunity of reconsidering our proposals with regard to this sector of the line when we receive Fowled observations as to key points ’’A” and . As you yourself have suggested, it will almost certainly he necessary to establish a new key point — u C n — in the neighbourhood of the well of Sufuk, in order to ensure that the whole of the Sabkhat Matti is included in the territory of Abu Dhabi* This will involve a re-definition in the instructions to Ryan of the line from key point 'B' (wherever that turns out to be) to the point where it turns due south (at present the intersection of Meridian 55 with Parallel 22). As we shall have to redefine this sector in any case, would it not be well to take the opportunity to carry the redefinition a little further, on the lines suggested by the Government of India, and, using our admittedly imperfect - but not necessarily inaccurate - information as to the eastern limits z 1 !(§) limits of the G-reat Sands as a basis, draw a line which should be easier for Ryan to defend at Riyadh, should put us in a stronger position to make a really firm stand, and, by approximating - at least in appearance,- rather more closely to the line proposed by Ibn Saud himself, offer a better prospect of the final agreement which it would be so much to our general political interest to conclude. 6. Looking at Thomas 1 map in the light of the text of his book, and in the light of the information now supplied in the telegrams quoted in your letter, it seems to me that such a line might run somewhat as follows. ( Prom key point U B H it would run in a south-easterly direction to the new key point ,, C ,, , to be fixed in the light of Powle’s promised report. This new key point ”0” would presumably be somewhere in the neighbourhood of Sufuk, say at the intersection of Meridian 52 last with Parallel 25 North. We have agreed that we must leave the whole of the district marked on the revised Hunter map as Qufa Liwah to Abu Dhabi, and this could, as far as/more i as one can see, easily fee done fey taking the line or less due eastwards from key point »C' to a new key point which might fee called key point 'D' and which might lie somewhere in the neighfeourhood of the intersection of Meridian 55 with Parallel 23, or perhaps slightly to the south-west of this point (say Meridian 54.40 with Parallel 22.40). We could further safeguard this position by a proviso that the line should fee so drawn as to leave the whole of the Qufa Liwa to Afeu Dhafei. Key point 'D' would in fact practically touch Ifen Baud’s own line as ~ claimed in the Saudi note of April 3rd. Bearing in mind Fowle's view that the Sultan of Muscat ma^; have a claim extending slightly to the west of Meridian 56, and seeing that the Great Sands, as marked on Thomas' map do not seem to extend any further to the east than a point lying approximately at the intersection of Parallel 22 with Meridian 55.40, we might perhaps take that point as a new key point 'E', whence the line would turn southwards. We are agreed that we want to keep the group of wells known as Ramiat Mugshin within Muscat and Oman, and Thomas’ map shows the edge of the Great Sands as not extending so far to/V ' to the east on Parallel 20 as on Parallel 22. I think ^ ^ we might therefore reasonably take the line from the new T t k ®y P° lR t ^ direct (running slightly west of south) to our present point on Parallel 20 at its intersection with Meridian 55. Thence the line would run as already defined in paragraph 16(d) of Ryan's instructions, which would remain unchanged, 7. Although I have put this very tentative suggestion at rather undue length in order to explain my reasons for suggesting it, it would not in fact involve any very drastic alteration in the definition contained in paragraph 16 (c) of our despatch of October 23rd to Ryan (E 6087/77/91) containing his instructions on the frontier question. As I have said above, we shall have to revise this paragraph in any case, and I feel strongly that we should not he deterred from making any further modifications in the line that may seem desirable as a result of the recent telegraphic correspondence by the mere fact that time is very short and that preliminary instructions have already heen issued. i8. If, as I hope, you agree with these suggestions, I am inclined to think that the test plan will he to call a further meeting of the Middle East Official Sub committee as soon as Powle's report regarding key points A and 'B' (and the possible new key point 'C') is received, or at any rate not later than November 12th, Which Will he practically the last date on v/hich we shall he aole to issue further instructions to Ryan to catch him at Bahrein before he leaves for Riyadh* It would proosbly be sufficient to circulate to the Sub-Committee a copy of my letter to you No.E 6087/77/91 of October 19th, of the telegram which you sent to Powle and the Government of India as a result, of Powle’s reply agreein to Meridian 55, of your letter P.Z.7713/55 of October 30th, and of the present reply. I may say that I have had a preliminary word with Parkinson over the telephone, and that I understand that he agrees that it would be far better to consider this question in the Middle East Official Sue—Committee with a view to deciding whether revised instructions to Ryan are called for on this point, than/mmam than merely to let »tt,„ s , aM „ th . y ^ ^ that It t, too late to reoon.ta.r t*. po.tttoa.

Saudi _AraMja South Eastern Frontiers. Instructions to Sir A.Ryan for discussions with Ion Saud. Question of exact alignment of Eastern side of frontier. Copy of to FOR INFORMATION. When the instructions to Sir A.Ryan were approved at flag H (above P.Z.7597), the exact extent of the concession to be made to Ibn Saud on the eastern side of the frontier was left open. Political Resident had been asked for comment on the suggestion that the concession should be extended from meridian 54 to meridian 55. The Resident in his telegram of 23rd October (P. Z. 7643/35) agreed to meridian 55. The Government of India however in their telegram of the 24th October (P. Z.7570/35) went further and suggested extending the concession to meridian 56 (i.e. to the limit claimed by Ibn Saud himself). This was based on the assumption (from Colonel Loch’s telegram of 22nd September, No.P.Z.6753/35) that the Sultan of Muscat’s 3330 1000 12.34 territo ry/territory, which His Highness once said in an informal conversation is bounded by the great sands, does not reach so far west - in the area in question - as meridian 56. This assumption is however traversed by a further telegram from the Resident dated 26th October (P.Z.7713/35) in which he says that the great sands might be somewhat west of meridian 56. He goes on however to suggest that the great sands themselves might be used to define the boundary, both on the east and on part of the north and south sides of it. The Government of India in their telegram of 29th October show qualified support for the suggestion. This eleventh hour suggestion has objections to it (of which U.S. of S. has pointed out one) and it was thought desirable to reply at once to the Resident deprecating it. The Foreign Office were also informed demi-offidaily of the substance of the telegrams. The papers are submitted for information.3761 5000 5.35 Draft Paper. P.Z.7713/35. Department. G.W. Rendel, Esq., C1G., F.O. 30 OCT 1955 My dear Rendel, We have had another exchange of telegrams with India and Bushire in the last day or two about the South Eastern Frontiers of Saudi Arabia which I can most conveniently summarise in a letter. 2. The G.of I. referred to an informal conversation which Bremner had with the Sultan of Muscat a year ago in which the Sultan is said to have defined his western boundary as running ^South from Baraimi along the edge of the sands of the Great Desert. Cn the basis of this - and of the fact that at one stage in private correspondence Loch had expressed the opinion that the intersection cf Meridian 56 and parallel 22 oiie~€f~ the ^key pointe' ^qh JLbn-Sau4l&amp; line) seemed to be outside the Sultan r s territory as so defined - the G.of I. suggested that i# the preeent--±±Re- is to be considered our absolutely final offer, it might be worth going the whole hog and 4 ^ A* conceding up to Meridian SG^fer-part of' JV ctr\ •'\J£ the e astern^frontien 3. Fowle, commenting on the G.of I.’s _r&lt;wV telegran, says that after discussion with Loch he is clear that the line indicated nf ormally by the Sultan may run r ather to the v/est of Meridian 56, (i.e. that jjoch * s previous interpretation was wrong) ile suggests therefore that it might besafer to describe the eastern boundary as “the sands of the great desert ,f . He on to suggest that “the northern edge of the great sands'* might be taken as the definition of the line running tom whatever point may be selected south of Katr in the direction of the north point of the eastern f rentier, and says that Loch will discuss this possibility 9 * with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. Similarly he suggests that the southern frontier (so far as it is north of Muscat territory) should also be the edge of the great sands. He adds that the obvious advantage of the Great Sands line is thao it is, so far as is known, the only physical feature in the area concerned.. 4 • We ha vp— t ^j 1 1 1 1 , ~ T -‘ 11 bfacoo tolognam-e 4. In reply to these telegrams we have pointed out that a treaty by saying / definition of the frontier as the edge (a) that since clearly the eastern of the great sands would be uncertain Sundary cannot safely be put at and unsatisfactory, since the sands ©y „ . / . . | presumably shift, and very likely Meridian 5 6 there seems to be no point 1 , , increase; and that, on the other n &gt; to define the frontier by a carto graphical line along the present edge of the great sands would involve an in suggesting a revision of H.M.G.'s final decision to stand on Meridian 55. (b) that in any ca^e the settled policy of H.M.G. is to/work on a basis of survey, which is obviously definition by coordinates, fixed points, impracticable; the present edge of the and arbitrary lines (which will take into sands would also apparently gi ve account so far as is possible the various Saud even more than he himself clam^ tribal, strategic, geographical, etc. in the north-east. Consequently, the considerations involved) and that it is only possible course seems to oe to hardly practicable at this stage to adhere to the decision reached that * I suggest a revision of this policy and the frontier should be defined by substitution of a different method of definition such as the Resident suggests. cartographical lines between fixed co ordinates, v/hich, however, can be so3761 5000 5.35 rr Draft Paper, Department. drawn* as to take account of known l ■ geograpnical features, as well as of strategic requirements and tribal distribution, so far as possible. At this stage it is hardly practicable to reconsider the whole question with a view to substituting some A different m^tho4 of definition. In conclusion we have informed Fowle and the G. of I. that on the eastern sector w&lt;i see no advantage in suggesting ^ . alteration of the present decision to offer meridian 55 (especially as in the imperfect state of ourjinformation! it is desirable to have a margin to l cover possible I'uscat or other claims),,, and that on the northern sector little. (c) that apart from these considerations, it would nO/doubt necessitate a careful and lengthy survey to determine exactly where the e dgejof the great sands is/and there is presumably the possibility/xhat a frontier of this nature may phi ft from natural causes* (VlX thnt irt—fhn- ni ^advantage is likely to be served by Loch raising the—qucoti on with the Sheikh of 1L A Abu Dhabi/, out that in any case we hope Lab that he will concentrate primarily on securing answers to our que stions dDout key-points ^ ^ ^ ^ 0(S. 5.

Ryan (on leave). 1 / Sii* 11 ’ tttq tv/To- f ’ n Foreign Office, October 23 1935 iilfe Majesty s Government are anxious to take advantage of voAr forth coming visit to King Abdul Aziz at Riyadh to resume, and if possible ^to advance the negotiations which have been proceeding for a settlement^of the eastern and on h-eastern yundar^s of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Indeed, it L probaWe that King Abdul Aziz himself will raise this question with you at an early staee as I understand that it is one on which he feels strongly; and it is in fact the “tte'pfTenTlir 01 ’ qUeStl ° n ^ ^ betW6en this -d Saudi A^alm in f l 2° U Y ill / eC0l 1 lecfc that after His Majesty’s Government had decided not to take their stand, so long as negotiations were proceeding, on a rigid adherence to the legal basis provided by the frontier laid down in this region by the Anglo- ui nsh agreements of 1913-14, you were instructed, in November 1934 to oner Wlth the ,^ audl Government for an agreed settlement of this’quest mu nrSt T ? a Q t0 , Ob n ain an exaGt statement of King Abdul iz s teiritorial claims The Saudi Government’s response to your enquirv JT Aorlnlt wh S r era m ° nth f but they 2 ventuall y krnished you, on the tntiAikf ’ rt a m ® m y andum putting forward a claim to a vast area in hvfTr- 1 k Arabla ’ wblcb was asserted to correspond to the areas frequented by certain tribes owing allegiance to King Abdul Aziz. You were already aware from the previous consideration which His Majesty’s Government had given to he matter that they were unable to entertain sued extensive demands lid you therefore proceeded immediately to the next stage contemplated in your instruc tions and offered to Saudi Arabia a small strip of territory—the so-called “ green line concession immediately to the east of the 1913-14 boundarv The subsequent departure of the Deputy Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs from Jedda rendered an immediate continuance of negotiations impossible, but the discussions were resumed with Fuad Bey Hamza himself during his visit to London last summer. ^ 3. Despite the offer which was then made by His Majesty’s Government ot a further territorial concession (bounded by the so-called “ brown line ”) it un qitunately proved impossible to reconcile the divergency between the point of view of His Majesty’s Government (as then agreed upon between all the various departments of His Majesty’s Government concerned) and that of King Abdul Aziz; and, on Fuad Bey’s departure towards the end of July, the discussions closed m what appeared to be a complete deadlock. 4. It was explained to the Saudi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs during the course of these discussions that His Majesty’s Government were prepared, with a view to reaching an amicable settlement, to make limited concessions, to the east of the 1913-14 boundary, of territory which, like that compi ised in the areas already offered to the King, could be shown to be predominantly utilised by tribes or settlements recognising his sovereignty. His Majesty s Government considered, however, that no satisfactory or durable frontier could be constructed on a purely tribal basis, in view of the shiftino' allegiance of the nomad tribes and of their wide and overlapping migrations, tribal considerations were valuable where it could be shown that an area was predominantly or exclusively frequented by a certain tribe with an exclusive political allegiance, but historical, geographical and strategic considerations would also have to be taken into account. The object of His Majesty’s Govern ment was not to establish a rigid frontier in the European sense, but to work out a boundary as equitable as could be attained from all points of view which would remove sources of uncertainty and friction by definino- the territorial 8167 [12260] ' * R 8'J6 A Z Vlimits within which Saudi Arabia and the other Arab States concerned would respectively be free to exercise full sovereignty. Fuad Bey Hamza replied that his Government considered that the only basis for a settlement was to establish and allocate the grazing grounds in accordance with the political allegiance of the desert tribes concerned. He maintained that the statement of King Abdul Aziz’s demands was drawn up on the basis of the grazing grounds of four tribal groups, in particular of the widespread Ahl Murra tribe, who acknowledged Saudi sovereignty; and, in support of the line claimed by King Abdul Aziz, he communicated the names of 161 wells said to be owned by that tribe! Fuad Bey criticised the concessions offered by Flis Majesty’s Government as being purely arbitrary and not in accordance with the material facts of the situation in the desert. The Saudi Government had, he said, worked out, after the most searching investigation and enquiry, a carefully plotted and rational boundary which took account of the political and tribal situation, and they were prepared to provide detailed evidence in support of their proposal; he insisted therefore that the next move lay with His Majesty’s Government, and that, if they did not agree with Saudi claims, it was for them to produce a detailed statement of their criticisms. Hitherto, he asserted, His Majesty’s Government had merely replied to the Saudi proposals by the simple counter-offer of an arbitrarily limited narrow area which failed to take account of the material facts. 5. His Majesty’s Government are reluctant to acquiesce in a continuance of the deadlock reached in the conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza last summer, without making any further attempt to reach an agreed settlement. As you yourself have advised, so long as this frontier question remains in its present indefinite state it stands in the way of the general and lasting settlement of Anglo-Saudi differences which His Majesty’s Government are anxious to bring about. Moreover, the rapid development of oil exploitation on the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf renders it very desirable that a definite limit should be drawn between territories which would be recognised as being under the sovereignty of King Abdul Aziz on the one hand, and as being under that of the rulers of Qatar, of the Trucial Coast States and of Muscat on the other. You will recollect that only in September last His Majesty endeavoured to stop the grant of an oil concession by the Sheikh of Qatar to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, on the ground that part of the concession area was included in his territorial claims. If the frontier is not settled there is a risk that similar difficulties may arise from the exploitation of the oil deposits in the Trucial Sheikhdoms if oil concessions should be granted therein. ^ . c ^ ea F therefore, that every effort should be made, especially at fi, 6 j?f eser h cri t lcai juncture in world affairs, to reach an agreed settlement of e dispute, to put an end to an uncertain and unsatisfactory situation, and to remove a source of friction which has already had an unfortunate effect upon the general course of Anglo-Saudi relations. With this object in view His ^ a J est .y. s Government, after obtaining fresh information from the British authorities of the Persian Gulf and of the Aden Protectorate, have reconsidered tde whole question, and they are prepared to go to the extreme limit of concession in the endeavour to formulate new proposals to meet the claims of King Abdul ‘ z \ z 111 ^ le g rea test possible measure. They have accordingly decided to authorise you to seek a favourable opportunity during the course of vour forth coming visit to Riyadh to resume negotiations in the matter, if possible with ig Abdul Aziz himself, but otherwise with his Ministers, and to furnish you with the following instructions for your guidance. ^ J; t Y ° U Wil !A gin A inJ A min g Kin g Abdul Aziz that, as a result of the conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza last summer in London, the whole question 1618 111 f 0llt V/ astern has been fully reconsidered by His Arihf! 7 8 Government, after consultation with the local 1 British authorities in In P aitlc ular His Majesty s Government have re-examined the boundary t y i ^ l V Aziz, as described in the memorandum communicated FnYl 'Ra r 6 r r^i 1 aSt ’ m tie ^ht °f the detailed evidence supplied by ° f ^ he ar g uments advanced by him in the course of discussion, f v her 'u f .T matl0n collecte d by the British authorities in the areas AhRAcHr’a'p Y0U Wl t j :len ex press in general terms the earnest desire of His Majesty s Government to go as far as possible to meet the wishes of King Abdul nn ^a izf 11 a f llcable settlement of the question, laying stress at the same time ong-s andmg treaty obligations of His Majesty’s Government towards3 ik mil r s l l D \*i a ™ «i«4 '^iiat,iflk lent hj uesce in a a; ; 'J Hamza b d settlemei ■ - lasting sellt t are aniidi ion the Ai Her the son that of tkii ler.

His Majesty’s Government have already expressed readiness to depart from their strict legal position by recognising Kmg P Abdul Aziz s sovereignty as extending over the western shore of the gulf kfown as , e pJohat-as-Salwa and over the Ikhwan settlements at the head of the Gulf- but they could never consent to attribute to Saudi Arabia features, such for of the P Gatf r PemA 6 f aksh ’ 7 hlch form ™ integral part of the physical structure fart ff A Ylf f-Yi a f lf ^’ ld hav ? alwa y s : 111 fact, been an equally integral pait of the Sheikhdom. An additional factor in regard to the frontier of Qalir is the grant by the Sheikh to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, with thC fidl fl’f’u-ffi ° f t fr, n^y s Government, of an oil concession over the m mdom ot Qatar This concession, which was granted on the 11th May ast while not extending beyond the limits of the State of Qatar as claimed by the Sheikh of Qatar and recognised as his territory by His Majesty’s Government, does actually extend to the south of the line claimed by King Abdul Aziz, (ry. paragraph 5 above); but the position in this respect will be already known to His Majesty through the communication which I instructed Mr. Calvert to make by my telegram Ho. 112 of the 20th September. Should you decide to advert to this development, you should take the opportunity to recall the fact that His Majesty s Government have formally assured the Sheikh of Qatar of their protection against any interference with his territorial rights. 10. Turning to the problem of the Khor-al-Odeid (to which Fuad Bey Hamza attached special importance), you will explain to King Abdul Aziz that, as uad Bey was informed in London, His Majesty’s Government have long iecognised officially the validity of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi’s claim to the whole oi this inlet, and have regarded his territory as extending round both the Khor-al- Dmrv\ aihm and the Khor-ai-Odeid up to a line, running westwards from the northern side of tne mouth of the Khor-al-Odeid, which forms the boundary between the territory of Abu Dhabi and that of Qatar. His Majesty’s Govern ment naturally cannot violate or disregard their obligations to these Arab rulers with whom, as the King has recognised by article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, they have long-standing and special treaty relations. Should you consider it wise or desirable to do so, you are authorised to develop frankly to the King a further argument which was used with Fuad Bey Hamza in London; namely, that His Majesty s Government have had for many years a particularly strong interest in the chain of Arab States on the coast between Qatar and Muscat; that the maintenance of this position is an important principle of British policy in the Persian Gulf; and that it would be at complete variance with this policy for them to agree that a powerful State such as Saudi Arabia should acquire a new r outlet to the sea on this section of the coast, to which neither political nor geographical considerations entitle it. 11. Pursuing your reply to the claims put forward in the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April, you should explain that a thorough reinvestigation of the [12260] b 24 si tuation has now been made by the British authorities in the Persian Gulf m order to ascertain the precise limits of the terntoiy of the Sheikhdom, of aG nnaKi iu the hinterland of the coastal strip. As a result it has been established that L district known as A1 Aqal, the Sabkhat Matti salt marshes, the districts shown on the maps as Bamunah, Uhafrah and Qufat-al-Liwa, all of which lie outside the area Predominantly covered by the Ahl Hurra tribe, are within the historic possessions of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi s Majesty s pigment are accordingly unable to agree to the eastward prolongation of the nronosed boundary being carried as near to the sea coast as suggested in the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April, since this would m their opinion be incompatible with their obligation to protect the rights of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi Similarly, they can And no justification for the extension of the daL^of King AbdulAzizls far east as meridian 56° since this would result in he inclusion in Saudi territory of the steppe country beyond the Great Sands and of the grazing grounds of tribes owing allegiance either to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi or to the Sultan of Muscat. , . , , 12 You will then inform King Abdul Aziz that the tribal position on the southern fringe of the Ruba-al-Khali desert and in the northern part of the Hadhramaut has also been the subject of detailed remyestigationsmce toe state ment of his boundary claim was received last April. As a result His Majesty s Government are satisfied that the tribes depending on the Aden Profectorate-and to particular the A1 Saiar, A1 Manahil, Ahl Kathir and Ahl Mahra-normal y range not only to the edge of the Great Sands between parallels 17 and 19- North but for some little distance into the sands themselves. You should explain that His Majesty’s Government were informed by Fuad Bey Hamza during the course of the conversations in London last summer, that King Abdul Aziz did not claim the allegiance of these tribes, and their enquiries have now definitely shown that the southern and south-eastern limits of the district predominantly frequented by the Ahl Murra (which they understand to form the basis of the Saudi claims in this area) do not extend to the edge of the sands, lle ! fliA north Hnd north-west of the line claimed m the feandi memorandum of the 3rd April. 13 You should then proceed formally to put forward the new otter which His Majesty’s Government, in the light of the foregoing considerations, have now resolved to make, emphasising once more that it is made with every desire to meet the wishes of King Abdul Aziz to the furthest possible extent, but adding m no ambiguous terms that it represents a final concession which His Majesty s Government will not be able to increase. I trust that you will thus dispel as far as possible any impression in the King’s mind that, in now putting forward proposals much more favourable to him than the two territorial concessions already offered, His Majesty’s Government would be likely to yield still further in response to continued bargaining on his part. As you are aware, this is a point to which the India Office attach much importance. You should explain that the new boundary which you are about to offer has been carefully worked out, and that, while the geographical historical and political considerations mentioned in the preceding paragraphs have naturally been taken into full consideration, the new proposals also take account of the full and detailed infor mation which His Majesty’s Government have now received from their local authorities in Arabia regarding the wanderings and habitats of the Ahl Murra tribe. In the light of this information His Majesty’s Government are prepared to agree in principle to recognise King Abdul Aziz’s claim to the allegiance 01 the Ahl Murra tribe, and they have endeavoured to align their proposed boundary so as to include as far as possible within Saudi Arabia the grazing grounds (“dira”) exclusively or predominantly utilised by the various nomadic sections of this tribe. A .. 14. As you are aware, the Political Agent at Koweit has recently reported that the Murra £ c dira ” appears to be bounded on the north, east and south by a line running from a point south of Hofuf parallel to but inland from the neck of the Qatar Peninsula; continuing in a south-easterly direction along the southern edge of the Sabkhat Matti marsh; turning south-south-east at the south-eastern corner of the Sabkhat Matti; running thence straight across the Eastern Rub -al- Khali as far as the Sabkhat Mij ora (approximately at the intersection of meridian 54° E. and parallel 20° N.); and thence sweeping westwards, within the southern limit of the Great Sands, so as just to include the important group of w T ells atShanna : I enclose herein a copy of a valuable sketch map prepared bv Colomd rckson to illustrate the result of his recent enquiries.i 1 ) • ou are authorised to make such use as you think best of this infnr mation; but you should be careful not to mve the imDressiou tW Mo 1 “ Government have in any way abandoned Ihek o!^ i^Bey Hamza in London, to basing the frontier solely on tribal considerations To ^do so might only encourage the belief that His Maiesty’s GkTrnment wiuW he U^atmigralilir' 1 At y th frUltleS f ! ar§unlei ! t as t() 'the fa f • At the same time ’ y° n should make the best possible use of thp recognise the sovereignty ofi f ajeSty ’ S are offering to of rtf itl ir I -P ty of Km g Abdul Aziz over practically the whole “ dira” Bev Hamza a! th/tlIfe ofrt aS defined ^ th ? “formation communicated by Fuad .bey iiamza at tire time of the conversations m London ' k rt lb: D ^ tei ; t f ese P reli . minar y observations you should, subiect to confirmation by the Pohtica Resident in the Persian Gulf of the exact location of ieymiihs A and B mentioned in sub-paragraphs (a) and (6) below, and to further tele graphic instructions in regard to the eastern sector of the frontier dealt with in sub-paragraph (c) below, make a formal offer of the following line as the boundary 0ttTr e Ld Ata^X f SaUdi f ra , bia 011 the one hand a “ d ‘he SheikhdZs S yatar and Abu Dhabi (m special relations with His Maiesty’s Government! the sultanate of Muscat and Oman, and the Aden Protectorate, on the other ’ (a) A line starting from a point on the eastern shore of the gulf known as the Dohat-as-Salwa about 4 miles to the north-east of the settlement ol (^asr-as-balwa, running thence in a straight line to a point, which may for convenience of reference be called ££ Key-point A,” which will probably lie at the western extremity of the salt lake known as feabkhat-al-Amra. (b) From this point the line will run roughly due south to a point to be known as Key-point BA This point, when fixed, will be situated approxi mately on the northern boundary of the Murra ££ dira) as drawn in the light of the latest information in the possession of His Majesty’s Government (i.e., on Colonel Dickson’s map (see paragraph 14 above)). it is proposed to fix this key-point B at some well on the southern edge of the district known as A1 Aqal (i.e., a short distance east of the intersection of meridian 51° E. with parallel 24° N.) to which a positive claim can be advanced on behalf of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. The Political Resident is still making enquiries as to the precise points at which these two key-points A and B could reasonably and properly be fixed, and further instructions will be sent to you as soon as his reports have been received and a decision has been reached by His Majesty’s Government thereon. (c) From key-point B it is proposed that the boundary should proceed, generally speaking, in a straight line, but so as to leave the whole of the Sabkhat Matti to Abu Dhabi to the intersection of parallel 22° N. with meridian 54° or 55° E. and thence down whichever of those meridians is decided on to its intersection with parallel 20° N. The Political Resident is being consulted on the question of substituting meridian 55° E. for meridian 54° E., as originally proposed, for this sector of the line, and further instructions will be sent to you on this point as soon as possible. (d) Thence the boundary will run in an approximately straight line, but so as to leave the Sabkhat Mijora in Saudi Arabia and the Ramlat Mugshin in Muscat and Oman, to the intersection of meridian 52° E. and parallel 19° N. (namely the south-eastern corner of the area— the so-called ££ brown line ” concession—offered to Fuad Bey Hamza in London last July), and thence in a straight line to the intersection of parallel 18° N. with the ££ violet line” of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914. (fi Not reproduced.6 ft 17. Your detailed comments on the proposed line, which you may make at whatever stage seems to you most appropriate, should be based on the^followina considerations : You should make what capital you can out of the small further concession which the new line offers at its northern end, in that it lies considerably east of the so-called c ‘ green line ’ ’ which you were instructed to offer to the Saudi Government last April. You should emphasise that, as a result ^ of their further thorough study of the matter, His Majesty’s Government are now prepared fully to admit the Saudi claim to the wells at Banaiyan, to which Fuad Bey attached such particular importance last summer. You should also lay stress on the fact that the sector of the line defined in sub-paragraph (6) of the preceding paragraph represents a genuine attempt to meet the Saudi claim while respecting the territory of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. You will then do your best to make it clear, while not letting it be thought that the line is drawn on a purely tribal basis, that the line now proposed leaves within Saudi iirabia the whole of the Murra c ‘ dira ’ ’ according to the latest information in the possession of His Majesty’s Government (see paragraph 14 above). Moreover, in carrying the boundary as far east as they are now doing, His Majesty’s Government will be recognising the authority of King Abdul Aziz as extending beyond the “dira” of the Murra tribe into the southern part of that of the Manasir, who are a tribe predominantly based on territory under the sovereignty of Abu Dhabi. You may then point out that the southern section of the proposed line, described in sub-paragraph (d) of the preceding paragraph, leaves not only the whole of the Murra “dira” in this region within Saudi territory, but also the important wells at Shanna, although these are used by tribes from the Aden Protectorate almost as much as by the Ahl Murra. In conclusion, it will be well for you to explain that, although the proposed boundary, like that proposed by King Abdul Aziz himself, is in its eastern and southern sections necessarily artificial, and based mainly on geographical co-ordinates, His Majesty’s Government are satisfied that it represents a fair and reasonable division between the various suzerainties concerned. 18. Lastly, you should make every endeavour to ensure that in any settle ment eventually reached all tribes are left free to use their normal wells and grazing grounds on whichever side of the line they may be situated. 19. Basing yourself on the broad lines of the instructions contained in the preceding paragraphs, I request that you will make every effort to secure the acceptance in principle by King Abdul Aziz of the new boundary proposed by His Majesty s Government. In the event of agreement being reached, they are still inclined to favour the procedure suggested in paragraph 8 of Sir J. Simon’s telegiam JNo. 70 of the 1st May, namely, the incorporation of the new line in a single comprehensive instrument in which the frontier would be defined as being between Saudi Arabia on the one hand and Qatar, Abu Dhabi, Muscat and the _ den 1 rotectorate on the other. This point is, however, premature at the present ime, as is also the question of the possible final demarcation of the frontier in the vicinity of the Qatar peninsula. I am, &amp;c.

IMMEDIATE. My dear Walton, I have had an opportunity of discussing with Ryan Bushire telegram No.862 of October 21st to you, about the further information which we require from Loch about key points 'A' and 'B'. 2. Ryan entirely shares ray extreme uneasiness at the delay which will follow if this programme is adhered to, and feels no less strongly than I do that every possible effort should be made to get the fullest available information at the earliest practicable moment. Moreover, I find that he is distinctly uneasy at the suggestion that the whole matter should be reserved for discussion with him on his arrival at Koweit on November 14th. He feels, as I do, that a decision ought to be reached on this vital question long before that date, and that a discussion of the kind suggested would probably necessitate further reference home and further inter departmental/ alton. Esq., G.B., M.G., India Office.C-aHOr— 0( departmental discussion, which wiil/ mean that he wii find himself greatly handicapped in the delicate negotiations which he will have to carry on with Ibn Saud in Riyadh. 3. In these circumstances, I greatly hope that you may see your way to send some further telegram to Powle, pointing out the great importance and urgency oi this question, and asking him to do everything possible to expedite the reports we require, and ensure that they are sent direct to London by telegraph. 4.

I feel that in view of the very short time remaining before Ryan's departure from this country (probably on 24th October) we cannot hold up drafting his instructions until we receive final replies from the authorities in the Persian Gulf and at Aden in reply to the enquiries made in accordance with conclusion (b) of the Sub-Committee. I understand that the Colonial Office have now heard that Aden agree/ ►C# Walton, Esq*, C.B*., M.C#V agree with the aligrunent of the proposed frontier in the South, so that we are free to give a definite description of that part of our new offer# Unfortunately it looks as though it may 'be some time yet 'before we secure the requisite information about key-points 'A* 1 and ,,! B W for the northern sector of the line. We have accordingly worded the draft so as to provide for supplementary instructions 'being sent later about the exact location of key-point We have tentatively drafted on the assumption that key- point 'A” will in fact be, as suggested, the westernmost point of the Sabkhat al Amra salt lake;; but it will of course be easy to revise this definition if necessary in subsequent instructions. Alternatively, however, it may be considered preferable to explain in the instructions that the fixing of key-point 'A** at the Sabkha is tentative and requires the confirmation of the authorities in the Gulf. I shall be grateful if you can let me have your observations on the draft instructions at the earliest possible/possible moment so that I can submit an agreed draft in good time to my higher authorities. I am writing in a similar sense to Blaxter and am sending copies of this letter to Pirie, Phillips, Osborne and Hale for any observations they may have to offer on the draft instructions.

Sir A.Ryan, (on leave) No: Sir His Majesty’s Government are anxious to take advantage of your- forthcoming visit to King Abdul Aziz 4*©. Riyadh in order to resume and if possible to ad vance the negotiations which have been proceeding for a settlement of the Eastern and South Eastern boundaries of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Indeed it is probable that King Abdul Aziz himself will raise this question with you at an early stage, as I understand that it is' one on which he feels strongly!and it is in fact the most important major question at issue between this country and Saudi Arabia at the present time, 2 0 You will recollect that after His Majesty’s Government had decided not to take Jtr wk&gt;ul their stand/on a rigid adherence to the legal \ basis ...Slpo o o e 'basis provideo, by the frontier laic, down in this region by the Anglo-Turkish _ p 1913-ld, you were instructed in November 1934 ) J to open negotiations with the dauai Government for an agreed settlement of this question by endeavouring^bo ooram an exact statement of King IJwxJte&amp;r s territorial claims. The Saudi response to your enquiry was delayed for several months s but the Saudi Government eventually furnished you on April ddhfcfc'last with a memorandum putting forward a claim to a asserted to correspond to the areas frequented by certain tribes owing allegiance to King Abdul Aziz. You were already aware from the previous consideration which His Majesty’s Government had given to the matter that they were unable to entertain such extensive demands, and A .. „ 7*r' ^ g. ynn he next stage fe-Ahe* f n&gt; vast area in South Eastern Arabia which wasstrip of territory - the so-called 'green line' concession - immediately to the hast q pJL-AhX of the ^kaglo-Turkish boundary. The.departure k of the Deputy Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs from Jedda rendered an immediate continuance of negotiations impossible,, but thf discussions were resumed with Fuad Bey Hamza himself during his visit to London last summer. 5. Despite the offery^of a further terri torial concession (bounded by the so-called H brown line') by His Majesty’s Government it unfortunately proved impossible to reconcile the divergentpoint&gt;cH9#view of His Majesty’s Government (as^agreed upon betvfeen all the various Departments of His Majesty’s Govern- -(fat ment concerned) and mi King Abdul Aziz ? and r VaQ discussions closedW Fuad Bey’s departure towards the end of July\in what appeared to oe a complete deadlock. 4^ ^ 1 explained to the Saudi Deputy o~*s£e„ *4/’Qur/ ' Minister ior Foreign Affairs /that His ^ Majesty’s Government were prepared, with a view to reaching an amicable settlement, to make limited concessions to the Mast of the 1913-14 boundary of territory which, like that contained in the areas already offered to the King, could be shown to be predominantlv a - o utilised by tribes or settlements recognising his sovereignty. His Majesty’s Government considered, however, that no satisfactory or durable frontier could be constructed on a purely tribal basis in view of the shifting allegiance of the nomad tribes and of their wide and overlapping migrations. Tribal con siderations were valuable where it could be ;hown that -m area was predominantly or ex-The object of His Majesty's Government was not to establish a rigid frontier in the European sense but to work out a boundary as equitable as could be attained from all points of view, which would remove a source of uncertainty and friction by defining the territorial limits within which Saudi Arabia and the other drab States concerned would; exercise full s replied that hi overeignty. Fuad Bey Hamza s GrOYernment considered that the only basis for a settlement was to establish and allocate the grazing grounds in accordance with the political allegiance of the desert tribes concerned. He main tained that the statement of King Abdul Aziz's demands was drawn up on the basis of the grazing grounds of four tribal groups, in particular Ithe widespread Ahl Murra tribe who acknowledged Saudi sovereignty, and in support of the line claimed he communi cated the names of 161 wells said to be -tut owned by fee Murra» tribe. Fuad Bey criticisedthe concessions offered by His Majesty’s Government as being purely arbitrary and not in accordance with the material facts of the situation in the deserto The Saudi Government^hadVworked out 5 after the most searching investigation and enquiry.,, m \&lt;$j4 I'fcfiTi gon-min? c j ent if4o» boundary which took account of the political and tribal situations and they were prepared to provide detailed evidence in support of their proposal: he insisted therefore that the next move lay with His Majesty* s Govern ment and thaL if they did not agree with Saudi claims it was for them to produce a detailed statement of their criticisms.% ? relucta/it to do quiesce in a continual nee general and lasting settlement of Anglo- dauui differences which His Majesty's Gov ernment are anxious to bring about.

They have accordingly decide;', to authorise you to seek a favourable opportunity Turing the course of your forthcoming visit to Riyadh to resume negotiations in the matter if possible with King Abdul Aziz himself s but otherwise with his Ministers* and to furnish you with the following instructions for your guidance. 7c You begin by informing King Abdul Aziz that as a result of the conversa tions with Fuad* London the whole question of the frontiers in.m Arabia. In particular ‘fee-y. have la .ie-examined the boundary claimed by KlDS At&gt;dul A2iz in the memorandum communicated to you on April 3rd last in the light of the detailed evidence supplied by Fuad Bey Hamza, of the arguments advanced by him in the course of It scussion and of thl^irfannation 9***^ collected by the British authorities in Ifc You meaM then express in general terms the earnest desire of His Majesty's Government to go as far as possible to meet /hi? the wishes of King ItatW a n amicable settlement of the question, laying stress at ^ne same time on the long-standing Treaty obiigaricns of His Majesty's Government towards the independent Rulers of the Arab States in SouGh-mastern Arabia.

You should then proceed to explain in detail the reasons which prevent His Majesty’ Government from accepting the boundary proposed in the Saudi memorandum of 3rd April last developing, for this purpose thenarguments '&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; used in discussion with Fuad Bey Hamza last summer And set out in the records of 1. the rQ-levarft»t. meetings, j Beginning at the Northern end of the proposed Saudi line you should.on*.should point out tho iniportance which His Majesty s Government attach to establishing a well as political and tribal considerations.

As a result His Majesty's Government are satisfied that the tribes depending on the Aden Protectorate -cuid in particular the A1 Sai’ar, A1 Manahi 1 , nnl Luthir and Ahl Mahra - normally range not only to the edge of the Great Sands between parallels J£- and 19° North, hut for some little distance into the sands them- * * selves* You should explain that His Majesty's Government were informed by Fuad Bey Hamza during the course of the conversations in London last summer that King Abdul Aziz did nc claim the allegiance of these tribes ? and their enquiries have now definitely shown that the southern and south-eastern limits of the district predominant$ly frequented by the Ahl Murra (which they understand to form • » tne basis of the daudi claims/) do not extend t to the edge of the sands but lie a consider able distance to the North and North best of the line claimed in the Saudi memorandum of 3rd April. ■ ij;* You then proceed formally to put forward the new offer which flis Majesty’s Government in the light of the foregoing considerations have now resolved to make, emphasising....N emphasising once once more that it is made vdth every desire to meet the wishes of King nMul Aziz to the furthest possibl extent. 7 ' mwo ijihaA it represdnts a final concession which His Majesty’s Government will not be able to increase, ur^ tfuj* dispel as far as possible any impression in the King's mind that in now putting forward proposals -u^y^acjn- ^dh-er-u-b-M^ more favourable to him then the territorial concessions already offered, His Majesty’s Government v/ould be likely to yield still further in response to continued bargaining on his part. As you are aware this is a point to which the India Office attach much importance. You should explain that the new boundary which you are about to offer has been very carefully worked out, and that while the geographical, historical and political considerations mentioned in the proceeding paragraphs have naturally...,^0 natu.ia.j-ly been taken into full consideratioiiy the new proposals also take account of the iQu-l and detailed information which.

The influence of the fuler of central .Arabia, wielded through Ms able Governor at Hofuf, Bin Jiluwi, eonpels peace between these old eneraies, not through direct control, for there is and can be none, but through the imuaee persomi prestige of Abdul &amp;zi% himself. A belief in Ms strength and star has swept across the sands ..... Upon tins conviction is founded peace in the sanas today. Tims the sand tribes proper are in mm degree leagued with Bin Band. They pay to him a nominal tribute and by that act are ensured, mutual protection one from the other*. But he goes on to say: 'Light as the bond Is the tribes grumble at it ..... They ail swear that the existing peace shall only last as long as the present regime of Riyadh. Let Riyadh or Hofbl be thought to have lost its power and raiding will be resumed immediately....*' (pp.271-2). He adds nhe politics of the eastern steppe are not unaffected by Bin Baud's influence, though this varies from year to year ... The politics of the southern steppe are completely fret from Bin Sand's influence, 5? (pp. 272-5). lx. Philbv/gr. _ idlby .as light be expected, is more enthasiastic. Recording a conversation with one of Ibn Sand's itinerant tax-collectors,who had been into the wain haunts of the Manasir he writes: 'I was interested to hear from Mb that Ibn Sand's influence Is felt today in all the bhaMra country, as they call the tract westward of the Oman aassif These tax collecting expeditions scarcely, perhaps, do more than pay the expenses involved in equipping and sending them out, but they do tend to spread the gospel of Wahabi peace and Arabian unity. Slowly but surely the ripples of stable gw emment broaden out from the centre, and the Manasir may be counted today as the subjects of ibn 3«ud, who asks little of them but the acceptance of his sovereignty and the maintenance of the public peace.* It is significant that the Saudi authorities arranged for two Manasir tribesmen, who were them sojourning in the Ja|urah desert south of ^ater to accompany Mr. Philby on his great journey. IV. The information sum arised in the preceding paragraphs leads to the following conclusions about the Manasir tribe: (1) The headquarters of the Manasir - their summer haunts and their permanent settlements insofar as they possess any - are in the hinterland of Abu Dhabi, in a district to which Ibn Sand could lay no convincing claim. it is not clear what control, if any, is exercised over them by the sheikh of Abu Dhabi. (2) Some sections of the tribe - e.g. the two groups encountered/encount ered oy Mr* Pbilby in 1952 liave porforoe cosie under the iniluenee of I bn 8sud through their penetrating in suntaer into terri toi*y — ©♦ g# tho Ja^ur^ii desert *• under the direot control of the Saudi Governor in Ilofuf.

Department. « Sir F. Stewart . Lr. Rendel is coming this afternoon at 3 o’clock to propose a last-minute alteration which the F.O. would like to make on a certain point in the instructions which it is desired to give to Sir A. Ryan before he leaves London on 23rd or 24th October, and which were agreed to at a meeting of the Official Middle East Committee on 24th Sept ember. ihe point is the meridian along which the eastern boundary of the concession to be offered to Ibn Saud should run. The brief history of this question is as follows:- Originally the F.O. proposed that our final offer should be (a) a cession in full sovereignty up to, say, meridian 02 , and (b) a desert zone (in which all would agree to refrain from exercising sovereignty^)up to meridian 55 . In April last they made a different proposal, viz .. that , the desert zone should be abandoned, and that full sovereignty should be ceded up to meridian 53. This was agreed to by a meeting of the Middle East Committee on 15th April. At the meeting of the Committee on 24th September, ;which dealt mainly with other points, it was agreed that the eastern limit should be meridian 54. Mr. Rendel now wishes to make it meridian 55 in order to make the concession look as attractive as possible, in the hope of securing an agreement (Ibn Saud’s own claim is meridian 56), and on the ground that we have no evidence of rights belonging to Abu Dhabi or Muscat. pught to be our last word (notes on P.Z. 2525/35). It will In April the 1.0. attitude was that meridian 53 2956 6000 7 34 U observed that the F.O. procedure has the result of giving/13436b 5000 1.35 Minute Paper, Department. giving in full sovereignty not only what was originally proposed but also the whole of what was at first to be a desert zone; they abandoned the desert zone proposal in favour of giving a bit more than was originally intended in full sovereignty, and have now gradually worked up the proposed cession of full sovereignty to cover the whole of the desert zone. I daresay, however, that we can acquit the F.O. of any conscious attempt to jockey us, and it is onma lagjjg. probable that we could make the whole of the concession suggested without jeopardising any possible claims of Abu Dhabi and Muscat. Before the meeting on 24th September Mr. Clauson con suit e^T^r^ToclT d.~o\ on ibhe question whether ^points ty ft m p are sufficiently outside the Muscat sphere to make it possible to concede them to Ibn Baud, and Col. Loch’s reply was that they seemed to be so (P.Z. 6581 and 6753/35). It might be desirable, hov/ever, to consult the Resident officially on the present F.O. proposal before agreeing to it. If this is done they will not be able to include it in the instructions given to Sir A. Ryan before he leaves, but those instructions can if necessary be modified by telegram afterwards. The F.O. plea of urgency seems no reason for dispensing with consulting the jj Resident on a point which they have thus raised at the last moment. / ^ ^^ ^ ^ ^ 44 ^ * cL^/ */. so. JfT '-&gt;2 ! L/6S FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l 19th October, 1935. E.6087/77/91. IMMEDIATE . My dear Walton, As arranged during our telephonic conversation of this morning, on the subject of the south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia, I write to give you the reasons why we should now like to introduce a small further modification in the proposed new frontier line &gt; which Ryan will be authorised to offer to King Ibn Saud when he goes to Riyadh. 2. I should, in the first place, explain that it is only quite recently that I was able to submit this question to my higher authorities here, partly owing to inevitable delay in the issue of the final version of the minutes of the relevant portion of the Middle East Official Sub-Committee meeting of September 24th, but chiefly because I was still hoping that we should be able ^ % . Walton Esq., M.C., India Office.^ 2 . able to obtain more complete and definite information from the Gulf authorities regarding key points A and B . When it appeared that we were unlikely to be able to obtain this further material in time, I had no alternative but to submit our proposals to my higher authorities in their present slightly incomplete form, (as sent to you in my letter of yesterday numbered as above), as it is essential that a decision should be reached as to the main lines of the instructions to be given to Ryan on this important subject before he leaves London next Wednesday or Thursday. But of course this has left us very little time. I have now had an opportunity of discussing the whole question fully with my higher authorities with the aid of the relevant maps. 3. Generally speaking, they are prepared to approve the lines of the proposed instructions to Ryan, and they recognise that it is not possible to offer to Ibn Saud any further concession either at the northern end of the line or in its south western sector. They have,have, however, talcen up the question of the eastern sector of the line, where, as you know, our proposed new line runs down Meridian 54 between parallels 22 and 20, and they ask whether we are really satisfied that we can make a clear and cogent positive case for claiming that the territory to the east of this line really falls under the suzerainty of either Abu l)habi or Muscat. 4. You will remember that we agreed at our meeting that it would no longer be practical politics to attempt to hold Ibn Saud back simply against a vacuum, and that it was essential that we should be prepared with a really good case to show that the territory which we were not prepared to recognise as falling under his suzerainty, did in fact fall under the suzerainty of someone else. We then took, as the main basis of our proposals, the limits of the dira of the Murra tribe, as shown on the blue print enclosed in the Political Residents express letter, No.676/S of September 5th your number (P. Z. 6581/35), and we assumed that we could4. could safely regard the dira of the Manasir tribe as falling mainly within the sphere of influence of Abu Dhabi or Muscat, and outside that of Ibn Saud. For this reason we did not attempt to take the line further east than Meridian 54, though even that would have left it rather doubtful whether the Sabkhat Mijora, shown on Dixon's map as forming the corner of the Murra dira would have fallen within Saudi Arabia. But I confess that I have never been quite happy in my own mind about our position with regard to the Manasir territory immediately to the east of Meridian 54 between parallels 20 and 22. Both Thomas and Philby (whose evidence may perhaps, however, be rather suspect speak of the Manasir as being a tribe of the Great Sands, and I find it hard to believe that either Muscat or Abu Dhabi have ever in practice exercised any kind of effective control, or even had any emissaries or agents, in the territory lying between Meridian 54 and 55 and parallels 20 and 22, and 1 feel more and more doubtful whether it will be possible for RyanRyan to make a case to show that any one hut Ibn Baud has any real claim to it* 5. In these circumstances I have now been instructed to suggest that we should grasp this particular* nettle rather more firmly by frankly offering Ibn Baud an eastern limit running from parallel 22 to parallel 20 down Meridian 55, instead of trying to hold him back to Meridian 54. We feel here that by doing this we should not in fact be giving him anything which could possibly be of any real value to us or to Abu rihabi or to Muscat. There seems ho real evidence to show that either Muscat or Abu Dhabi have ever in practice extended so far, and I do not think it could possibly be said that we were abandoning any rights actually exercised by any of our prot£g£s. On the other hand, if we were able to carry our new line as far east at Meridian 55 we should be making an offer to Ibn Baud which, at first sight, should prove very much more attractive and acceptable to him than the offer at present agreed on. If you will look. the negotiations to break down. I feel sure, in fact, ^ that this would greatly improve his tactical position. Moreover, the line would then correspond much more closely to the limit of the Great Sands as shown on Thomas f s map, and we should therefore have yet another strong argument on our side for not conceding any territory to the east of it, since there has never been any Question of Ibn Saud having any rights over the steppe country which is clearly dependent on the states of the coastal b^elt. Lastly, it seems to us here that if we can convince Ibn Saud that we are really trying to be generous in this sector, we may have less difficulty in getting him to accept our line in the north and south, where it is really essential that no further concession should be made. 6 . It is true, of course, that if we start out by offering a line running as far east as Meridian 55, we shall have no further concession left to make. But it has always been realised that our present offer is to be a final one and we have, in fact, made this point clear in paragraphparagraph 12 of our draft instructions. Indeed the fact that our offer is now a final one seems to us a further reason for making it as generous as possible and then standing firmly on it. We feel that this would he a far better policy than to risk having to admit later, as we have had to do in the case of Banaiyan, that our original informa tion was faulty and that the case which we re presented as so clearly established proved, on further examination, to be ill-founded. 7. As I said over the telephone, I do not think that the other Departments concerned are likely to raise serious objection to the present proposal to carry the line as far east as Meridian 55. You will remember that the War Office at a meeting last winter were inclined to go even further in this direction. The Colonial Office will not be affected, as no alteration is contemplated in the southern line where it marches with the Aden protectorate. I do not think the Air Ministryare much concerned with this part of the line and certainly no Admiralty or Treasury interests are involved* In these circumstances, if you would agree to our carrying the line to Meridian 55, I think we might still he able to get the instructions issued to Sir A* Ryan before his departure. The definition would only have to be altered after key point B - i.e., in paragraph 13 (c) of our draft instructions, which would then run 'From key point B the proposed boundary proceeds in a straight line to the intersection of Meridian 55 and parallel 22 and then down Meridian 55 to its intersection with parallel 20'. 8* There is one small further point which ought perhaps to be covered. If the line runs down Meridian 55 and turns south-westward at the intersection of Meridian 55 and parallel 20, it will, I think, be necessary to safeguard the position-S position as regards tne area known as Rami at Mugshin, which is described on page 139 of Thomas's 'Arabia Felix 1 , and clearly belongs to Muscat, l would there- xore suggest that at this point of the line it should be clearly stated that the Sabkhat Mijora will be left within Saudi Arabia and the Ramlat Mugshin will be left in Muscat. There seems to be plenty of room for the frontier to pass between the two, which it should in fact do if it is drawn in a straight line from the intersection of Meridian 55 and parallel 20 to the intersection of Meridian 52 and parallel 19, as we would now propose. This will involve a small addition in paragraph 13 (d) of our draft instructions, which might run as follows 'leaving the Sabkhat Mijora to Saudi Arabia and the Ramlat Mugshin to Muscat and Oman', but this (which will probably be necessary in any case) need not lead to any serious difficulty. Unless I hear to the contrary I will come over at 3 o’clock on Monday afternoon to discuss the question further. yours sincerely,Draft Paper.

As explained in our telegram of 30th September the present object of H.M.G. is to offer Ibn saud a boundary line which would in effect recognise his control over the Murra Tribe^which, while safeguarding our essential desiderata in the north (in regard to the southern boundary of Qatar and in regard to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi*s claims to the Khor-al-Odeid, CoujQpl Aqal and Sabkhat Matti) afeeul-4 at the same time if possible be based on convincing arguments^ such as the collection of ssakat by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in the area east of the line offered to Ibn Saud -foss. the predominant use by our tribes of that area. It is also desired to offer Ibn Saud a further small concession in the area at the south of the Qatar Peninsula to which he attaches much importance. With these objects in view, H.M.G. themselves suggested to the Acting Resident a tentative line and asked him for further information in regard to certain specific key points on that line (para.5 of our telegram of 30th September). It was also suggested, if necessary (paras.6 and 7 of our telegram) that an officer might be sent to make a personal survey of the area in question, roughly between meridians 51 and 52, with a view to fixing a minimum of satisfactory key points. Colonel Loch’s telegram of 13th October does not appear k&gt;vaw.UU -fcr _ _ _ _ _ , W answers/the quest ion5 asked in our telegram. Colonel ixjcn himself carried out an aerial survey but for the reason given in paragraph 2 of his telegram he found it impossible to fix the important key point which is required in the area near the/M 'j V*- wells of XSiuwaihin^mentioned in paragraph 5(a) of our telegrami The Foreign Office have pointed out that the information promised by Colonel Loch in paragraph 1 of his telegram will only arrive just before Sir Apdrew Ryan leaves for Riyadh to negotiate with Ibn Saud a!fid that in any case it is not likely to help us with the specific questions asked in paragraph 5 of our telegram. They^aleo pointed out that the linee running S.E. from Ambak, Sakak or ^asr-es-Salwa which Colonel Loch suggests might be offered to the Saudis would not permit the t small concession which H.M.G. desirs to make in the area at tne base oi the Qatar Peninsula. It seems possible, moreover, that a line running due S.E. from ^asr-es-Salwa might bring Ibn Saud up to the sea at the Khor Bhuwaihin. Although it ie quite probable that the Resident may find it impossible to furnish answers to our questions in the time at his disposal, the Foreign Office are most anxious that a further attempt should be made to obtain more definite information from the Gulf before 24th October when sir Andrew Ryan leaves for Riyadh and they have themselves drafted a telegram which they suggest might be sent to the Resident. The Foreign Office draft seems generally satisfactory and we might, I think, accept it, subject to the pencil amendments suggested in the margin in which the F.0. will probably be prepared to concur. Paragraph 4 of the original F.O. draft might be read as suggested that H.M.G. would in the last resort be prepared to surrender the whole of Aqal to Ibn Saud, since it is not impossible that we may find it difficult to obtain any very definite evidence in support of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi’s claim. H.M.G. have, of course, no intention of doing this and I have suggested an amendment which puts the emphasis in the last paragraph rather differently. &lt;? send,(subject to final concurrence by F.O.) rttfliss- k Nr ^ 1^ ^! f * ['■ I (see Locsh's despatch C/96S —1*&amp;/58 of December 12 , 1954.) for which positive supporting evidence vL was not given but- is now most urgently r^mired &gt; -v ! for Cir A* Ryan’s use fjk,. ^*««» -'&lt;t V U -r 4 ^ ^ide paragraph 7 of iay telegram naaer refej^cnt^^/ ^ 5 # Please telegraph your present views, in light of foregoing, on questions raised in para graph 5 of jay telegram under reference* If none of wells there mentioned is suitable please state whether in your opinion there is any well or xjCScA' ivJi^s 14^ dccuut ^ C&lt;r^£*Cb JyuU n . feature of adequate importance in area Aouth of Aqal , of to which Sheikh has claim strong enough to be made if necessary breaking point of negotiations. 4* If you do not feel able to express any such views now, please indicate how soon you coidd^^a x* h arrange for personal enquiry to be made of Sheikh laiu'Otp:i: emit*; oofio..-sl a bMd iko i.-.o.ir - or -ustu i who should be left in no doubt of use to which required information will be put vis-h-vis Ibn / 3 #aud* He be mdiMb realise that it-will- ' d L 44a4~-ae-poss4A4e-for His M?:&gt; fen ^ f ——* - - ■■ — q^fen^Ua ^ ak-cr-unsonnd olaia pjs^to hold Ibn 4JicCt cLotA^cic- co^ /^f\ Cfrychsi ^ ^ -y^, ^ ^ aE 6170/77/91. foreign office, s.

My dear Clauson, Since our telephone conversation this afternoon I have further looked into the question which you raised in your letter No.P.Z. 7177/35 of October 9th possible communication to Ibn Sand regarding Loch’s proposed reconnaissance with a view to establishing key points A and B at the base of the Qatar peninsula. 2. A preliminary point which strikes me is that, with the best will in the world, it wii^be practically impossible to get the -sews of^the proposed reconnaissance to Ibn Saud in time, since Loch says in his telegram No.T 229 of October 7th that he proposes to carry it out on about October 11th. If then we were to telegraph even tonight asking Loch's views, it is difficult to see how we could get his reply in time to enable Calvert to get a suitable message to the King - who, I believe, is. in Riyadh - before the reconnaissance started. .Clauson, Esq., India Office . Auh jh lyjr- kiA Jr*''''- W A ( , v e3. But apart from this I confess that, while it is only with the utmost reluctance that I question Powle T s views, I feel more and more doubtful about the wisdom of the step proposed. 4. As you know, our attitude hitherto has been that Ibn Baud has no legal rights to the east of the Blue Line, and no de facto rights to the north and east of the Green Line. Indeed I took great pains to emphasise to Fuad Hamza last summer that H.M.G. were committed to recognition of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi’s sovereignty over the territory to the west and south of the Khor-al-Odeid, and that there could be no question of our admitting any Saudi claims over the territory beyond Qasr—es—Salwa and Sakak, which was geographically obviously a part of Qatar. As recently as September 20th we instructed Calvert in our telegram No.112 of that date to take the same line with the Saudi Government in regard to the territory to the north and east of the Green Line. You will remember that the relevant paragraph of the telegram runs as follows:- 'The southern limit of the oil 'concession granted to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company by the Sheikh/'the Sheikh of Qatar not only does not extend beyond this Green Line, hut lies to a considerable distance 'to the north of it. The concession does not therefore 'extend to any territory under discussion with the 'Saudi Government'. 5. I see that we took very much the same line in connection with the air survey of the south-eastern corner of Transjordan in 1934, and you will see that in our telegram No.140 of October 11th, 1934, to Jedda (a copy of which appears to have been sent to you in our printed letter No .E 6269/145/25 of October 12th, 1934) 'we 'I am most reluctant to make any communication to 'the Saudi Government regarding this survey since it is 'not intended that aircraft should in any circumstances 'fly over indisputably Saudi territory and communication 'might only give impression that His Majesty’s Government 'were doubtful of the strength of their case'. 6 . While therefore I fully appreciate the need for showing Ibn Saud every courtesy and doing nothing which might unnecessarily antagonise him, I feel sure that it would be a serious error in tactics to make any communica tion to him about a flight which, ex hypothesi , would be carried/carried out entirely over territory to which we have consistently maintained that he has no valid claim of any kind. 7. Were the reconnaissance likely to lead to serious risk of a clash with Ibn Baud’s tribes so that some action of the kind suggested was required in order to secure its physical safety, the position might he rather different. But this does not appear to he the case, and anyhow the time factor, as explained above, would seem to rule out any precaution of this kind. 8 . In all the circumstances^! hope that you and Powle will agree that it will he better not to telegraph in the sense proposed, and merely to leave Loch to act manner suggested in his telegram of October 7th. in the/ / / / / / / ini jr- IIIDIA OFFICE mmm&amp;LL, z.h i 9th October, 1935 y dear %ndel foald you kindly refer to Loch’s telegran of the 7 th October * of which x enclose a copy for reference. 1 also enclose a draft telo^r» to ,.oc:h ®hicki is based on a saggefrtian by Fowl® m&amp;i explains itself* 1 should be glad to know ardently whether you agree with this safest ion* Trier©, my, of course, be objection to asking m ooimanication to Ib» Saod about the mvmmt® of oar political officers in areas -hioh mo regard as within the jurisdiction o' the Tliaikhs of catar ^icl iba ''habi, bat ?? awle f s point is that Xbn ^md my hoar of this reconnaissance in what he regards m disputed territory md cay feel m% annoy mce rtiich could be avoided if he were told in a friendly manner beforehand what was bain. : done. -oars sincerely, (Bgd.)

Perhaps you would consider this, and, if you agree, make the necessary arrangements with Webb. Clauson, Esq. Yours sincerely, X , A .p-s. On looking through your draft telegram again it occurs to me that the word 'sovereignty' in line 7 of paragraph 1 may he a little strong. Would it not te better to say 'suzerainty', 'overlordship' or simply authority'. If we say 'sovereignty' it may merely revive a rather fruitless argument as to the extent of Ibn Baud's povrer, and, as you know, I think we now have no choice but to let Ibn Saud have the Hurra, chiefly on the ground that however limited his authoinft^ may be, the authority of anybody else is certainly very much less. * I see, by the way that Webb’s name has been mis typed as Welsh in the margin of your draft)T7 ^T7£&gt; South-Eastern Boundaries of* Saudi Arabia. * Please see the submission at P.Z.4910/35. It was then decided to obtain more infomation from the Resident in the Persian Gulf as to the allegiance of the various tribes - particularly the important Murra tribe - in the areas under dispute with Ibn saud and as to the extent of the territory in which the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi exercises authority (e.g. by collecting taxes from the tribesmen). In the light of this information it was felt that a decision would have to be made by the Middle East Committee as to whether the negotiations should be continued and, if so, as to the point beyond which we should let the negotiations break down - viz. the ultimate line beyond which it would be impossible to make further concessions to the Saudis for the sake of a general settlement. V A good deal of useful information has been sent, i ? response to our request, from the Gulf - particularly in the Residents air mail letter of 5th September (P.Z.656]/nl) - and the Middle East Committee met last Tuesday, September 34th. The draft Minutes are attached, together with a draft telegram to implement the conclusions so far as we are concerned. The conclusions are in accord with the general principles of the submission at p. 2.4910/35, which was approved by the Secretary of State, that is to say:- (1) relinquishment of Banaiyan as part of a final settl ement (2) no compromise over Katr or the three key areas of Abu* Dhabi, viz. Khor al Odeid, Aqal, and Sabkhat Matti (3) decision on a final line beyond which we should allow the negotiations to break down. The proposal to depute a special officer (such as Mr. Bertram Thomas or Captain de Gaury) to survey the who 1 e// %h) whole area under dispute is now felt to be unnecessary in view of the ariount of detailed information now available But oefore the final line under (3) above can definitely be laid down at the north-western end, the meeting felt it was necessary to have a limited local survey undertaken (possibly by Colonel Dickson who, of course, is fluent in Arabic and gets on with Bedouin) in order to make sure that we do not give anything away that belongs to one of our Sheikhs. As Sir Andrew Ryan is paying a personal visit to Itn Saud in the near future (starting late in October) during which the Frontier question is bound to be discussed, and as the Acting Resident will shortly be at Bahrein (from September 30th to October 3rd) it is most desirable to get the telegram off on Monday. It explains itself, and has Foreign Office concurrence. As regards maps, since there are now so many on the file I have made another one, which may be helpful as showing all the lines up to date. I suggest it be read with Colonel Dickson* s Tribal Map (blue print) and Mr. Thomas’s map, which gives an idea of where the desert begins and also gives wells, etc. These three maps are in an envelope below the draft telegram.

The Air Ministry had, however, raised in this connection the question whether His Majesty’s Government should.not, in future, take a more active interest in the internal affairs of the Tracial coast than hitherto. He invited the Air Ministry represen tatives to develop their arguments before the Committee. AIR vICE-MARSHAL COURTNEY invited the Sub-Committee to consider in particular two of the recommendations con tained in Colonel Fowle’s despat ch; their gist v/as: - (l) That Hj.s Majesty’s Government should avoid active interference in the internal affairs of the T ru cial Sh eikhdems.(^) That his Majesty’s Government should refrain from pre- ^en^j.ng on land between Trucial Sheikh- hcjaiSo yh’-j tASEumecs. tha-i under* this latter head there should also he inc] uded the prevention of internal dieturbsuees in any one She!khdom)- ihe Air Ministry 5 he said^ were^to their regret 5 unable to agree that either recommendation v/as consistent with Lord Curzon’s address of 1S03 to the Trucial Sheikhs. That speech had hitherto been accepted as the ruling authority in matters affecting the policy of His Majesty’s Government on the Trucial coast 5 and as a basis the Air Ministry fully accepted it still. There were * however s incon sistencies between the policy contained in that speech and the policy now recommended by Colonel F'owle, and these inconsistencies must 5 in the Air Ministry’s view 5 be resolved. He drew particular attention to the following passages in Lord Curzon’s address:- (a) Paragraph 1. ’’My object is to show you that . are not forgotten by the Government,, but that theg adhere to the policy of guardian ship and protection which has given you peace and guaranteed your rights for the best part of the century”. (b) Paragraph 3. ’’The British Government * the guardian of inter tribal peace”. (c) Paragraph 3. ’’These engagements ere binding on every one of you 3 and you have faithfully adhered to them. They are also binding in their reciprocal effect upon the British Govern ment ^ and as long as they are faithfully observed by the Chiefs* there is no fear that anyone else will be allowed to tamper with your rights or liberties”.inter your Chi e l oish loy eminent have no desire to x ere j, and have never interfered 5 in internal affairs s provided that the s govern their territories -with Jus tree 5 , and respect the rights of the r or eign traders resident therein. If any internal disputes occur* you will always find a friend in the British Resident, who will use his influence, as he has irequently done in the past, to prevent these disputes from coming to a head, and to maintain the status quo ^ for we cannot approve of one Chief attacking another Chief by land, simply because he was not permitted to do it by sea, and thus evading the spirit of his treaty obliga tions'^ . Air Vice-Marshal Courtney pointed out that conditions had changed since Lord Curson made this speech, and said that as regards the first point which he had quoted from Colonel Rowle f s despatch, it was the view of the Air Ministry that, if British interests were threatened owing to any developments in tne internal affairs of a Trucial Sheikhdom, His Majesty's G-overnment should intervene. Air power now permitted His Majesty’s o-oveminent to intervene, or prevent hostilities, on land, if they wished to do so, and ne suggested that his Majesty’s Government should make it clear to the Trucial Sheikhs that they could and would intervene by sea, air or even land, if necessary. As the safety of the air route to the Far Last was now the principal British interest on the Trucial coast, the Air Ministry had taken the initiative in asking that the matter should be considered by the S ub-C omrn i 11 e e. he would take the recent incident at Debai as an example. Colonel Fowle, in his despatch, had represented txiat the action then taken by His Majesty’s Government did not constitute interference. It was, however, to be assumed that this action was taken because the British authorities feared that British lives and property might ultimately be threatened, if the quarrel at Debai had4- developed. The Air Iv'iniqtP-; -, ' Wlul -' e - i -y agreed with the action taken 3 hut he must nr ke it clpn- + i - -- ~o elec, taa, they could not regard it as anything hut int erroren~e thrvv~u - . noes tnougn of a hind perfectly jus tifiable and consistent with Lo^d (•'•m-pv,' - u uarson s speech. They would therefore like to see the -mu „„ . . e ‘ ^ policy of flis Majesty's Government re-stated in somewhat clearer terms. -inning to the second point raised in Colonel Towle's despatch, air V 1 r*c-&gt;,oi U0U1 tne ^ marked that the passage vUiiwi he had Quoted If'roin re t^ o‘r- t np ~ ■ - to.,. paragrapu 5 01 Lora Cur son's speech ^veus dictated by the ^‘ar-t t rnt i- r r- . a tuat m Lord Curzon’s day the only -cuion open to his Majesty's Government was action by sea. -'--as advent of air power had abolished this limitation, and it was now perfectly possible for His Kaje b 11 ! b o-o ve rument to prevent hostilities between Trucial Gheikhs on land as well as on the sea. He drew attention to the guarantee of protection sy land which had recently been given to the Sheikh of Qatar. In that case His Majesty’s Government had had, in the prospect °‘ m 011 00noessioa bein e granted, a strong inducement thus to extend their commitments. That same inducement would soon arise on the Trucial coast, end, in nis view, His majesty's Government would be obliged again formally to extend u neix oomuiiunents accordingly. It was not, however, desirable that such further commitments should be assumed with the same 1 ■jens oha tne same very brief preliminary consideration as had been tne case m Qatar. New foreign interests were likely to appear at any time on the Trucial coast, and he suggested that imnitjuia consideration should be given to tne question cf applying to the Trucial Coast the principles which had already been up plied in the c. s e oT Qatar • COLOunL LOwnxC obseived that, if the safety of the air route could be assured with the present commitments of His iviajesty 1 s u-oveminent, he saw no need to extend them. He quoted in support of iiis view the recent quarrel between His Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi over-5- the K.A.F. petrol store. In that ease* measures had successfully been taken (viz. 5 a threat to immobilise the Abu Dhabi pearling fleet) which were designed to affect the people of Abu Dhabi s as well as their 'Sheikh. ho internal interference had been necessary, and the Sheikh* having given his signature to the agreement by which he had allowed the petrol store* had simply been told that he must give effect to it. Mh, iNDfi] suggested that it might be convenient i: he spoke before the discussion progressed any further since from the Foreign Office point tages in framing the question in even wider terms than the . of view there would be advau ral sea by the Air Ministry It Ministry had employed. 'While many of the principles enunciated in Lord Curzon’s speech of 1903 might still be applicable* it seemed essential to recognise that the general situation in the Gulf* particularly from the international point oi view* had been completely and fundamentally revolutionised by post-war developments. Lord CurzonAs speech had been made at a time when the Persian Gulf had been virtually a British lake * under unchallenged British control and cut off by almost impassable deserts from the North and West 0 The Ottoman Empire had proved no serious menace to this position. These was no aviation* there was no oil* and there was little j. oreign ci'acie. as a resui fc * the limi ts of His Majesty ? s Government’s action had been set solely by themselves. To-day the Persian Gulf was one of the world’s highways * bordered by strongly nationalist States* whose interest in the Gulf was real and active* and the discovery of oil had led other foreign Powers to take an increasing interest in Gulf affairs. In his view* the time had cone* or- was at least rapidly approaching* when His Majesty’s Government would no longer be able to maintain- 6 - 4 their previous living, as it faced with the policy of merely keeping others out, were, from hand to mouth, hut would he necessity of going either forwards or and backwards. a.e leared hiau, ii vis Majesty's Government tried to maintain a negative policy of non-intervention and minimum control, they might find themselves subjected to very strong pressure from foreign powers whose nationals wished to he allowed to enter the Persian Gulf for commercial exploita tion, ct'/iauion, etc. ne mentioned in this connection the American Government's interest in oil, the Italian interest in snipping, the Japanese interest in. trade and the Dutch interest in flying, as factors which had already made their appearance; and with regard to the first, he reminded the meeting that, when the Koweit oil concession was first proposed the American Government had threatened to penalise British oil interests in territories under American influence if American interests were not allowed to compete at Koweit. This was a threat which almost any Government was in a position to make with regard to British trade and industry, civil aviation, shipping, etc. In these circumstances a negative attitude would he increasingly difficult to maintain, and if we were not to find foreign Governments intervening in the Gulf on behalf of their nationals we should certainly have to assume a greater measure of definite responsibility ourselves, as we had been obliged to do in Qatar. It must not be forgotten, moreover, that the French and the Dutch might at any moment want to remove their air route to the Far East from the Persian to the Arab coast. With regard to oil, His Majesty's Govern ment must face the possibility that it would be found in commercial quantities. In that event, questions of juris diction and of protection would arise and must be faced, aso-t v^atar. Another consequence oh tv, e iL ' lice 01 tne grant of oil concessions on the Crucial Coast would he the necessity of according protection to the companies and their worhin^s and employees. Eut the grant of such protection in its turn made it necessary to fix boundaries. for all these reasons the Foreign Office view vma tw , « - 'a 8 that, if foreign political influence was not to be allowed to penetrate into the Gulf area, it would be necessary for his Majesty’s Government to assume an increasing degree of better defined control, and generally speaking, therefore, he wished to support the Air Ministry's views. CGLOHEL POALE agreed that the discovery of oil on the ^rueid Coast meant that his Majesty* s Government must offer therr protection, making it, of course, conditional on the actual grant of a concession. if oil were not found, it was clear that no guarantee was necessary. d. iOi,.,.jEL pointed out, however, that in Koweit the Anglo-Persian Oil Company*s investigations had failed to find oil which another company had afterwards located. Moreover, in patar it had been necessary for His Fajestv 1 s Government to promise the Sheikh protection in return for the grant of the concession without waiting to learn whether -T.ny oil was ac cually found. Even if it were unnecessarv to grant protection in return for prospecting licences, this would merely postpone the question for a short period. There followed a general discussion arising from the following hypothetical question: what would be the position of His Majesty’s Government vis-a-vis a foreign Government if, say, a prospecting party of its nationals were killed or otherwise molested on the Trucial Coast by - ( a ) Sandi Tr ibe smen ; (b) Tribesmen of one or other Trucial Sheikhdom; - 7 -COLONEL i'CWLE maintained that this situation need never arise since no subject of a foreign power could go to the irucial Coast unless Eis Majesty’s Government allowed him to do so and that, as regards oil prospectors etc., His Majesty’s Government would take steps to ensure that any concession on the Trucial Coast went to a British company. iviR. Rux'-lDEL pointed out, however, that a British company was not always available to compete - particularly in view of the Oil Agreement of 1928 between the various groups of the Iraq Petroleum Company - and that in such circumstances it might be impossible, even if it were desirable, to keep foreign enterprise out. Foreign Governments wished to deal with a responsible authority. Who was at present that authority on the Crucial Coast? Unless His Majesty’s Government were in a position to say that they were ultimately responsible in all respects, some foreign Power or other might take matters into its own hands. It was important that these admittedly hypothetical questions - which might, however, at any moment become acute - should be faced before the pressure of foreign enterprise became too great. COLONEL POLLS said that, as regards aviation, there was already machinery for controlling the Dutch and the French air lines should they decide to use the Arab-coast. As regards foreign air lines, he doubted whether His Majesty’s Government had the means to exclude them. This drew from AIR VICE-MARSHAL CGUNTNEY the remark that His Majesty’s Government did not wish to exclude them, but to control the conditions in which they should enter. - 8 - ■ i™- 9 - lurning to uie question of oil development, COLOKEL POWLE gave it as his view that, if American engineers were killed on the Trucial Coast, and the United States Government appealed to His Majesty's Government to take action, the right course would he to make the nearest Sheikh responsible and inform him that he must pay appropriate compensation, failing which his town would he bombarded by sea or bombed from the air. He quoted a recent case in which a dhow had been looted by natives at Debai. There, by making the Sheikh responsible the matter had been successfully liquidated and no inter vention had been necessary. The Resident, however, still maintained that His Majesty's Government could prevent any foreign engineer from going to such a place at all. CAPTAIN PHILLIPS said that the agreement with the views of Colonel to see His Majesty’s Government .keep Admiralty were in general Howie. They would prefer a free hand hy avoiding any unnecessary new commitments. As he understood the nislory ox tnis cues tion ? the reason for confining guarantees to the sea in the past was that the physical arguments against '• ''hi guarantee covering land operations had keen very strong. whereas protection from the sea was an easy matter. The advent of aeroplanes had undoubtedly made possible many operations which previously could not be undertaken, but he was not convinced that it could be said to-day that they alone could uphold a guarantee by land, and that if we gave such a guarantee there was no chance of our being involved in mili tary operations. The case of the Sheikh of Mohammerah had shewn that guarantees were two-edged, and he thought that His Majesty’s Government should beware? of them. In Qatar the offer of a guarantee had clearly been the trump card in the hands of His Majesty’s Government who had thought the offer of it worth while. It ’would, no doubt, be a trump card in other places too, but, in that event, we should, he thought, be careful not to play it too soon. His Majesty’s Government should-10-- retain their freedom of action se long ae poeeibi at present no reason why they should sacrifice it. a guarantee of protection in inter-Truci a! i -Li'-ioia.i a.i.bputes seemed to him to have little object and no thougat it a piestionabla policy to give the Sheikhs a guarantee against Ibn Gaud before t^i w *“ s ail y °i- m their Sheikhdoms which His'Majesty's Government wished to protect. He would, however, on the general question, lixe to .Tiaioe a purely personal suggestion which was, Gnat His Majesty* s Government should again consider whether there would not be considerable advantage in replacing the native agent at Sharjah who, he understood, had recently died, by an ingiishnan, He thougnt ic could no longer be maintained that Sharjah was too dangerous lor this purpose, and he hoped that this idea might be examined. fid AIR MINISTRY REPRESENTATIVES intimated that, if the proposal were put forward officially, they would strong! support it. y LiR. cLAJSON said tiiat oJie India Oifice wore in general agreement with the views of the Government of India and of Colonel Howie. Referring to Mr. Render s suggestion that, in tneir relations with the Crucial Coast, His Majesty's Government muot now either go backwards or forwards, he indicated that the Indio (Uiice were ready to advance when and as necessary, but that they saw no adequate reason why His Majesty’s Government should not continue to pursue their present policy. If an oil concession were granted on the Truciai Coast, for example, at Ras-al-Kheima, the India Office would not oppose the necessary guarantees of protection being given. As regards foreign penetration of the Truciai Coast in general, Mr. Clauson observed that while the political control which His Majesty’s Government at present exercised was still-11 undisputed, it had often been convenient for them to be able to describe the Trucial rulers as being 'independent Arab Sheildis in special relations with His Majesty's Government None the less, the India Office would not wish to exclude the eventual possibility that control on the Trucial Coast migxit oe tighbeneu up by some such measure as the placing of a British political agent in one of the Sheikhdoms, but their general policy was one of evolution* ieR« HriLm expressed a feeling that the Air Ministry were perhaps suggesting that fences should be taken before they were reached,, THN CHhlNMAN remarked that His Majesty’s Government was of course responsible for providing protection for the Trucial Sheikhs against aggression by Ibn Saud 3 SIR A, RYAN said that he was concerned with the question of protection only in so far as it meant protection against Ibn Saucu The most explicit statement in Lord Curxon’s pronouncement was to this effect:- 'If you behave well, His Majesty’s Government will protect you against all comers'. His Majesty’s Government had, in Sir A. Ryan’s opinion, taken a serious risk in delaying the recent specific promise of protection to the Sheikh of Qatar* Their reluctance to respond to earlier appeals by the Sheikh for some guarantee of protection had almost driven him into the arms of Ibn Baud. He reminded the meeting that the Sheikh had visited Riyadh a few years back and while there had established relations with Ibn Saud which appeared to have been a great deal closer than was altogether convenient for His Majesty’s Government. COLONEL FOWLE held that His Majesty’s Government had, in their Treaty with Qatar, an effective instrument for prevent ing such developments and an adequate ground for punitive action if they materialised. In this case, the Sheikh of Qatar had, in fact, done nothing serious. IAiR VICE-MARSHAL COURTNEY pointed out that even if this were so, the Sheikh had refused for years to agree to a landing ground in Qatar although it had been strongly pressed for. Reverting to the incident at Dehai in October 1934, Air Vice-Marshal Courtney repeated that the Air Ministry were unable to find that the pronouncements of the Government of India covered the support which the Royal Air Force had affor ded. The Air Ministry, he said, were of course at all times ready to give this support, but he must point out that they had net formally assumed any obligation to do so. The second proclamation issued by Colonel Fowle on the 24th of October had warned the inhabitants that 1f 3 ..... o.. those responsible will be held to account'. This was in the last resort a threat of force and it implied that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to take action beyond any that was now formally provided for. If, therefore, the policy recommended by Colonel Fowle was to be approved, the Air Ministry must press, if only out of consideration for the Air Officer Commanding in Irag, that the Committee should make a recommendation to clarify the policy of His Majesty’s Government in regard to such action. MR. RENDER suggested that, if His Majesty’s Government y/ere to admit their ultimate responsibility for the affairs of the Trucial Coast, such eventual action might be covered. AIR VICE-MARSHAL COURTNEY and AIR VICE-MARSHAL BURNETT referring to the fact that in certain possibilities the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq, might be called upon for assistance, both insisted strongly that these possibilities were not by any means remote. Ihey were, in fact, daily becoming more urgent and when there were oil concessions to be protected the Royal Air Force would need more facilities, such as landing grounds, than 7/ere at present available. They could not, therefore, agree to leave the matter in an uncertain state. - 12 -n THE CHAIRMAN then proposed, and the Sub-Committee after some further discussion agreed, to recommend as follows (1) that His Majesty’s Government must admit ultimate international responsibility for the affairs of the Trucial Coast, ineluding Qatar; (2) that the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq. might he informed that intervention on land in the Trucial Sheikhdoms was an additional commitment which he might in certain circumstances he called upon to meet; (3) that the interested Departments should examine the personal suggestion put forward hy Captain Phillips, for the appointment of an Englishman as agent on the Trucial Coast in place of the present native Residency agent at Sharjah; (4) that as the departments represented on the Suh-Ccnnittee were unable to reach agreement as to the necessity or otherwise for a new pronouncement or the adoption of a new policy in the Persian Gulf, this matter should therefore he reserved for further consideration. /Air Vice-Marshal Courtney, Air Vice-Marshal Burnett, Captain Phillips and Mr. Seal then left the meeting which proceeded to discuss the question of the Eastern and South- Eastern boundaries of Saudi-Arabia.

THE CHAIRMAN opened the discussion by saying that he understood that the situation was that a deadlock had been reached in the negotiations with the Saudi Government over the Question of the frontier, and from the papers that he had read on the subject it did not look as though there was much hope of reaching a solution. Be was not personally familiar with the question and his observations were, therefore, made primarily with the object of eliciting information, but he would be glad to know whether it could be regarded as satis factorily established that it was, in fact, worth while pursuing the negotiations in these circumstances. Was It really a matter of urgency that these boundaries should be settled? Was it not a fact that the permanence of the Saudi -.14-Empire depended to a large extent on the life of one man - King lion Baud? Were the Sub-Committee satisfied that, in these circumstances, it was desirable that His Majesty f s Government should bind themselves to a particular frontier in these areas despite the uncertainty of the future? SIR A. RYAN explained that the settlement of the frontier was now an urgent matter for two main reasons. In the first place, as regards the northern end of the frontier, the question of oil now made an early settlement imperative, since disputes had arisen over the areas of certain important oil concessions. Secondly, the action which ills Majesty f s Government had been obliged to take in defining their interpretation of the frontier had created in Ibn Baud a genuine sense of injury which was poisoning the relations between His Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabia. Sir A. Ryan was anxious to see this source of friction removed since at present it was rendering Anglo-Saudi relations extremely difficult, and furnishing a ready handle to all those who wished to exploit Ibn Baud’s feeling of resentment to the disadvantage of His Majesty’s Government. MR. RENDER further developed Sir A. Ryan’s points. In the first place, the oil question was one of increasing urgency, since King Ibn Baud had now openly challenged the situation created Dy the grant by the Sheikh of Qatar of an oil concession over his territory to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Ibn Baud had protested strongly against this concession, and had even threatened to take steps to prevent its exploitation. Further, there was reason to believe that the American oil interests who haa obtained a concession from Ibn Baud v/oula be quite ready to extend their operations over the disputed area, thus confronting His Majesty's Government with a most embarrassing fait accompli . Again, various interests were actively seeking to obtain an oil concession (or at least a prospecting licence) from the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, v/hich would lead to further difficulties if no boundary existed.-16- Secondly, unless some boundary could be agreed upon, there would be no limit to Ibn Baud's expansion towards the coast, and to his continued penetration into the hinterland of the Trucial Sheikhdoms. It would pay us better to agree on a boundary which would set a term to his expansion, than, by leaving the situation fluid, to risk finding that he had further extended his influence over - and possibly even in some cases completely absorbed - the territory or tribes of our proteges, thirdly - ana this was a point of great importance - His Majesty r s Government were confronted with a situation of great delicacy ana even danger in the Red Sea area. The Italians were making strenuous efforts to extend their iniluence ana undermine our position, and were constantly making au.vances to Ibn Saul. While it might not he to the latter's ultimate interest to respond to these advances, he might he driven to do so if he felt that His Majesty's Govern ment were not prepared to give him a ’’square deal’-h it was, therefore, of major political importance that we should treat Ion Saua as generously as possible over the grievance which he xelt against us in this matter of the frontier. Lastly, His Majesty’s Government were committed to continue negotiations by their acceptance of Ibn Saul's invitation to Sir A. Ryan to visit Riyadh on his return to his post next month. It was essential that Sir A. Ryan should have instructions enabling him to make constructive proposals at his meeting with the King, and, if these instructions were to be ready before his departure, time was extemely short. mR. CLauSON said that the India Office, without necessarily accepting all the foreign Office arguments, did not v/ish to dissent from Mr. Rendel's conclusion, and agreed that it would be convenient to reach an early settlement. They would not, however, regard failure to reach an agreement with Ibn Saul over this question of the frontier as necessarily disastrous.ivt-.. r.&amp;WDhX then surmnai ised the recent history of the Question. He recalled that, as a result of American en quiries,, his Majesty's Government had felt obliged to define th^ix- interpretation of the legal position y v/hicn was that uj.ic ronoiers set up by the fjiglo-Turkish Conventions of If 13 and 1914 (i.e. * the n blue H and lf violet if lines) were otill internationally valid* me fact that one of these ocnvenuions had not been ratified was irrelevant since the irentier was fully covered by the ratified Convention. Moreover * legally Ibn baud could not escape from the liabilities of an Ottoman succession State* especially in view of has pre-war agreement with the Ot toman Government * by which ne accepted Ottoman suzerainty. But a careful re-examination of the question had shown that * while the legal position might have been unassailable had the territory on the non-Saudi side of the line been under the en ec uiv e sovereignty ox any other Power* tnere would be gx'eao dix f iculty m holding' I bn baud back* as it were 9 against a vacuum. Our position was* therefore * by no means as strong as we had at first supposed. Neverthe less* our policy hitherto had been consistently based on rlie principle of holding Ion Baud back as far as possible, and the weakness of our position had always been that we could 371 aiis no effective positive claims on behalf of our selves or our proteges to the territory on the eastern side of the line we had proposed, out that it was still against a vacuum that we were trying to establish the eastern limit of Ibn baud’s dominions. Our object had, ox course, been not to commit ourselves to a recognition oi Saudi authority over an area over which it might wane on the termination of Ibn baud's personal rule; but it-18- now seemed plain that; the maintenance of this negative p o! icy would be impossible. I bn Baud had made it clear that he would only be willing to discuss the matter on the basis 01 positive claims on behalf of our proteges* and it was only by following up sue , a positive policy that a settlement was now lively to be reached. n.ltnou^n it; was easy to be wise after the event * ivir ’ r(ende l 'bound to say that he thought our tactics had been faulty., having obtained from I bn Baud on the 3i npril last a clear and reasoned — though no doubt t-ardy and exaggerated - statement of his claims* we had virtually ignored his proposals and retorted immediately op proposing first one and then another artificial line which we really could not adequately defend. One of our key points on our proposed line had been the Well 01 bana^yaix -j an b it was largely on this point that the deadlock had been reached in June. But now it was clear * from later information from British authorities in the Persian Gulf* that the Bheikh of Abu Dhabi had no real claim to Banalyan* that it was a predominantly Murra well 9 and that it would be necessary to give way over it. iv-.r • r end el t her ef o re sugg e st ed that His Ma jesty * s Government should now try to define a new frontier line* based on the reasonable maximum claims of our proteges o..nd on the reasonable claims of I bn Baud to suzerainty ovei certain tribes ^ such as the hurra * bearing in mind at me same time questions of oil and of protection* but without giving too much importance to the risk of a possible vacuum on the Gaudi side of it. The necessary data were now available* and he was prepared to make general suggestions for such a line.-19- MR. GLAUSON said that' he understood Mr. Eendel’s proposal to be that His Majesty’s Government should non agree 5 as it v/erej, to transfer the vacuum to the Saudi side of the frontier. But it seemed undesirable to establish any frontier lino further than the limits of Ibn baud's real authority. . If the frontier v/ss to be fixed on the basis of the limits of the territory over v/hich the Trueial Sheikhs exercised any authority ? it might conceivably be desirable to revive the idea of a 'desert zone” ? though, he himself, did not know much about the details of this idea and believed it had not found favour with the Committee. Otherwise, while further con cessions to Ibn Baud in the desert area might be considered if there were a really firm prospect of agreement, the India Office could not agree to the boundaries of the Trucial bheikhdoms being fixed and to Ibn baud being allowed to come right up to them. MR. EhNDEL said that it now seemed inevitable that the boundary should be co-terminous, but explained that the line that he was about to suggest was not intended to constitute a frontier in the ordinary sense of the word. It had al ways been clearly recognised that frontiers in the European sense were entirely inapplicable to these desert areas. On the other hand, the various devices which had been suggested for getting over the difficulty of a 'frontier * 1 in such an area, a desert zone, a neutral (or unattributed) belt, a purely tribal definition, etc., had all been found impractic able. The present proposal was for a line which should, so to speak, bisect what would otherwise have been a neutral area. It was not intended that it should be a line up to which the author ity o f each side should in 3 : ;r act ice be fully and effoctively exercised. In practice the ; effective authority for each side would probably stop short a long way from the actual line. it was a linemeant as far as possible to bisect the empty s;pace between ^ ae ^LJ-iLcto. ximits cl' the two authorities, but which would nevercheless mark the ultimate limits to which each authority could legitimately be extended. It would necessarily be - as any line in the desert must be ~ an artificial line. But it should be so drawn wherever practicable as to provide on either sine lor as wide a space as possible of empty territory which would incidentally give the Air Ministry the space ,: to turn round in ff for which they had so often pressed. Mr. Rendel suggested that in fixing this line we should be guided mainly by the new information now available as to the areas predominantly wandered over by the Murra tribe, i.e„ ? the Murra Lira. He explained that none of our protegds had ever claimed to exercise any effective control over the Murra tribe that His Majesty's Government had never seriously challenged Ibn Gaud's claim to exercise suzerainty over them and had acquiesced in Fuad Bey’s contention that the tribe was unaer Saudi suzerainty, and that in practice it would be impossible to refuse to recognise Ibn Baud's claim to wells predominantly used by that tribe. If this criterion were adopted and we were to base any new concessions on the latest information regarding the extent of the Murra Dira, it was now clear that His Majesty's Government must abandon their claim to the wells at Banaiyan, and this concession might be important seeing the stress which Fuad Bey had laid on the point in London. On the other hand there were certain areas which His Majesty’s Government could not in any circumstances concede to Ibn Baud. The first was the area actually covered by the new Anglo-Iranian Qatar oil concession. The Sheikh of Qatar had, with the approval of His Majesty’s Governmentgranted to the A. I. O.C. a certain area which we had always re garded as being under his sovereignty. The limits of this (a copy of which was attached to the concessitf area were shown on a map/which the meeting had before } It was out of the question to hand over any of this area to Ibn oaad s who in any case had no claim whatever to it. More over, this would leave within the territory of Qatar two important physical features which are included in the area of the A.I.0.0. concession, viz., the Jebel Naksh, which is the southern spur of the Jebel Dukhan and an integral part geographically of the Qatar peninsula, and the A1 Qalail, which is described (on page 50) of Mr. fhilby's book 'The Dmpty Quarter' as forming 'the westward face of the .star plateau'. secondly, it was an agreed principle that Ibn Saud should not be granted any outlet to the sea to the east of the Qatar Peninsula. He had no claim to any such outlet, which he had never possessed, and His Majesty’s Government had already committed themselves to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, whose rights they had recognised over this area; this had been clearly explained, last June to Puad Bey, who had appeared to appreciate the position. SIR A. RYAH entirely agreed that there should be no question of Ibn Saud being allowed to acquire an outlet to the sea to tne east of the Qatar Peninsula. Basing himself on these principles, MR. RENBBL suggested as a tentative basis for discussion a new line running some what as follows:- (a) Starting from a point on the coast, say, four miles to the north-east of Qasr-el-salwa, the line would run south-eastwards to a point (which could be called key point f A f ), at, say, the western end of the salt lake discovered by Mr. Bertram Thomas and known as the Sabkhat-el-Amarah. This would give a small further concession to Ibn Baud in an area to which he attached great importance, without at the same time abandoning any territory to which the sheikh of Qatar had a reasonable claim. It would also establish a line parallel to the line cf the A. I.O.C. concession and in comparison with the so-called 'protection line', would actually be somewhat more satisfactory from the Air Ministry point of view. The details could, of course, only be worked out locally, but generally speaking such a line would seem to take reasonable account of the physical and political features of the situation. -HI-(Id ) a'rcni this point (k.Qy -on i t T ' ! \ + v south until the point'fwhi nb • ^ ?' ine w °uld run due point ’B') where It w Cl Tn 1Qh , m:L ? ht 136 called key the Hurra Dira as defined in'the’ 11 ? ? or I hera edge of from Colonel Tjickson ov 11 tae lates1: ' information supplied by him, of which a^blue^o^nttaa^b ^ circulated to the meetincr ' ^ pnmt had been of Abu Dhabi a reasonabl e’hPi ^ hl r W ° Ula give the Sheikh to exercise the rights wblb °l ° oast to enable him PO =SO «ea over ««*. nonuiex ol the Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi ) c (C; T dianh!lv‘k fr °o + 1Cey PDA ' B ' } the line might rm. qe-t^nn 11 - ^ straight line to, say the inter- section of parallel and meridian 54 , thus ro-oghly lolloping the northern limit of the hurra Dira snown on the _ blue print supplied by Colonel Dickson, it^would be important, however, to be able to establish a good claim on the part of Abu Dhabi to some definite feature in the neighbourhood of key I ?° 1 ^ ^ V'/nere the north and south line turned and began to run eastwards. Possibly such a point might bo i. ound au the Dhuwaihim wells as snown on Major Ghees eman’s map, or at the well of oufuk, which the Sheikh of A'bu Dhabi claimed, although Fuad Bey had also put forward a strong Saudi claim to it. '\d) ti'Om the intersection of parallel Sb and meridian 54 tne line would run due south to the point shown on Colonel Dickson’s blue print as Sabkhat Minora. This would give I bn Baud a small part of the Manas ir country, hut leave tne bulk of the Dira of this tribe, which were mainly an Abu Dhabi one, outside Ibn Baud's oontrolc (e) If the line then followed roughly the southern limits of the Hurra Dira, as shown on Colonel Dickson’s blue print, it would correspond broadly to the southern frontier offered to Fuad Bey in June, and would produce a frontier line which would correspond •with the latest information now received from Aden. MI?. CLAUS ON expressed doubt as to the propriety of our de parting from the method hitherto followed of advancing by gradual stages in the direction of meeting Ibn oaud’s desiderate tie suggested that if Eis Majesty’s Government adopted the Murra Dira as the basis of a new and greatly extended offer, Ibn Gaud might be encouraged to hope for even greater concessions than Mr. Rended contemplated. Nevertheless, he thought that the India Office might consider the new proposal favourably, if it promised to lead to a definite settlement. He asked for infor mation as to the prospect of its doing this. MR, BLAXTER asked whether there was not some danger that, after this offer had been made, the Murra Dira might prove to be even larger than the area shown in the recent sketch-map supplied by Colonel Dickson.I MS* RUNDEL explained that what was proposed was not to offer to recognise Ihn Baud's sovereignty over the Hurra Dira as such, hut rather to make our latest infomation regarding the Pi pa the 'basis of a new and generous offer. SIR A. RYAH said that be had had in mind what he understood to he onO of the reasons for Mr. Clausen’s hesitation. If a large offer were now made to Ihn Saud, he might think that he 'had got His Majesty’s Government ”on the run' and wait for them to run still further. Sir A. Ryan could not affirm that the offer now proposed would bring about a settlement, as it would ho based on considerations connected with the lira of the Murra tribe only, whereas Ibn Baud’s statement of his desiderata purported to rest on claims to sovereignty over the Murra, part of the Mona sir and two other less-known tribes. Nevertheless, he thought that the proposed offer, even if it did not lead to a settlement, would place His Majesty’s Government in a. more advantageous position. 'fho y could point out that they had given full consideration to Nuad Bey Hamza’s statement regarding what should be included in the Dira of the Murra, the one tribe involved to which Jon Baud appeared to have a strong claim; and that, altnough they had found it to be more extensive than they supposed, they were not deterred by that fact from making their further information regarding it the oasis of a new and generous offer. Bir a* Ryan considered that, if xon Baud retorted by pressing his other demands and a rupture ensued, His Majesty’s Government would be in a much better position to throw the onus oi the rupture on ibn Bo.ucc oy arguing that they had made him a very handsome offer, far in advance of any concession they had previously contemplated, and that he had rex used to accept anj'uhing -B5-T - 24 - short of hi s own inaxinium demands* Sir A. Ryan stressed Mr. Rendei r s explanation that what was proposea was not an offer of the hurra Dira as such, but of a geographical line which took full account of it. The Saudi Government could be reminded that they themselves had been reuucea to defining their desiderata south of Parallel 22° N purely by geograph!cal co-ordinates. MR. CLAUSON said that he thought that the India Office would be prepared to agree, subject to the under standing that certain key points and areas, such as the Sabkhat Matti, Aqal, and of course trie Khor-sl-Odeid, were safe-guarded for the Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi. COLONEL idJVLE indicated that he aid not oppose the ab an a o rime n t of B an a i y an. MR. RENiD'L said that the line he naa suggested was designed to safeguard the j'-oints ana areas referred to by Mr. Clauson but that the two pivotal points appeared to be those which he had described as key point ’MV’ and key point V B'. It woula oe necessary to have at the earliest possible moment further data to enable His Majesty's Govern ment to fix these points and adequately to defend their claim to them on behalf of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in the impend ing discussions with Icn Saud. He therefore suggestea that a telegram should be sent to the Acting Political Resident on this particular aspect of the question asking him to make definite suggestions for these two points, and to supply suitable arguments in defence of our claim to them for Sir Andrew Ryan's use. MR. CLAUSON ana COLONEL FOWLE agreed that it would be desirable to do this.Whitehall C 27th Sei NCLUSI0N5 . It was agreed (&amp;j to recommend that bir A.

The arrival of the sketch map accompany ing this despatch has made it possible to do the work more thoroughly. Accompanying this note is a secret outline map showing these various lines which can be. placed over my 1 -inch = 32 miles map? or the 1 -inch =32 miles map of Arabia and the Persian Gulf. The map also illustrates and emphasises the factors affecting these lines from the point of view of the Aden Protectorat 2&lt;, Our case for not having the western end of the new line joining the violet line lower than parallel 13 was that if it did so it would cut into the steppe country inhabited by the Sei’ar. In the same way we did not want the line any Io?/er than parallel 19 at uhe eastern part of the Protectorate because according Mr. Bertram Thomas’s map we should have it cutting into the Mahra and Mananil territory. What shape the line takes between the Wadi Eiwa and its neighbouring wadis on the west and tne country through which Mr. Berta.'*am Thomas' s line of march passes at the eastern end of the Protectorate we do not know. I have assumed that it runs in a comparatively straight line as this is in accordance with the general lormauion of the land in that part. It seems to me that this assumption is reasonable from a boundary point of view for even if the steppe receded greatly between these two points? forming a bay into the ’Amiri and Minhali country? it would not be reasonable to expect us to have-6- a Saudi salient thereo 3* ‘ft Of the wells enumerated 4314/77/91 of the 9th July^ by Fuad Bey in Print I have traced 45 on Messrs. Bertram Thomas’s and Phi Toy 1 s maps and I know of no other authorities to trace the others. I have marked the four most southerly of these wells on my maps* Mr 0 Philby on his map apparently claims them for the Hurra and I have placed the name Murra where he places it in addition to its more usual locality much further north. Mr 0 Bertram Thomas also visited Shanna and met there Manahil and Karsh, In addition he places the Rashid not far away to the east (l have placed them In the same position on my maps) and hr 0 Philoy also spears of Manahil and Sei'ar frequenting the well. Both these authorities seem* therefore, to bear out my own impression that wells well into the desert are more or less common property. Actually, these wells are nearer the Hadhramaut tribes than they are the Murra 0 4, I think we were quite right, if not too modest, in asking for a margin of 20 miles of desert between the steppe and any future boundary line between the Aden Protectorate and Saudi Arabia. We have not got as much as 20 miles in tne western part of the Sei’ar country between the steppe and the violet line and I think it would be a great mis take if we were to risk having a boundary appreciably nearer than that proposed in Aden telegram No. 19 of the 29th March. In any case this leaves the four most southerly wells claimed by Mr. Philby for the Murra to the north, though in view of the remarks above I consider they would be much better left as common property in the desert zone proposed. I pass now to a few comments on the conversation recorded in Print B. 4126/77/91 of 3rd July. Of the ** seems probable that the Wadi Eiwa crosses the violet line.three tribes quoted by Fuad Bey at page 2 line 4 only the Sei ? ar are genuinely a Hadhramaut tribe. The Karab belong to the western borders of the Hadhramaut but are nominally at any rate ’Aulacpu I do not quite see how the Imam of the Yemen could claim either of them 0 The Sei’ar are definitely based on Qu’aiti dominions and the Karab hover between Qu f aiti and r Aulaqi. The Jinaba I do not know? but they are probably the Janaba of Oman, Who the Sherif referred to in line 5 is I do not know unless he is the Sherif of Beihan. I understood from Qadhi Muhammad bin f Atiq al Bakri of Beihan that the tribes in the direction of Shabwa respected him very much. The mansabs of the Sei'ar who are Seiyids, are given at page 89 of my Political Report 0 6 . As regards lines 11 and 12 the map shows that there is much justification for not placing the line south ©f parallel 18 at this point. Mr. Rendel’s remarks following those of Fuad Bey have much point when the ownership of the southern wells such as Shanna is considered* 7. In Fuad Bey f s remarks on page o it is difficult to see how the n abandonment of the gaudi claim to the Manahil, Al Kathir and Mahra sub-tribes” can be justifiably described as a sacrifice. The Manahil as shown on page 54 of my Political Report and page 5 of my Note of 21st January are in the closest form of alliance with the Qu’aiti and consider themselves at Qu’aiti disposal# The Kathiri (except those in Dhofar) are under British protection by virtue of the Qu T aitl-Kathiri agreement of 1918 (if not by virtue of previous practice and the existence of the violet line)? and the Mahra have been under British pro tection since 1888, + Since writing these words I have h ad a conversation ' _ r'i1~ ^ w-, i A vn n 1-8- 8 . To summarise the position - 1. a I think our general aim should he that no steppe- land on territory occupied hy our tribes to the north of the Hadhramaut, particularly the Sei’ar ! Aw amir* Manahilj and Mahra should he given away. 2. That we should retain a strip of at least 20 miles of desert to the north of the steppe as being country principally frequented hy our tribes* 3c That it would he better that such southerly wells as Shanna plainly frequented hy our tribes to as great an extent as Saudi tribes should belong to a desert zone than be transferred to complete Saudi sovereignty^ because if Ion Saud made his new boundaries really effective it would (if these wells belonged to him) probably result in an in fusion of Saudian politics into the Hadhramaut valley* 4* While from our point of view the acceptance of 3 'would leave us in a sound position, it may be that wider considerations require some lurtner concession to those already contemplated. If the point of view expressed in 3 is sacrificed, I do not think that in any circumstances the line suggested in our telegram Ho. 19 of 1935 should be modified further than as follows: '’From the inter section of parallel 22 north and meridian 55 east, down that meridian to its intersection with parallel 20 thence in a straight line to the intersection ox meridian 52 with parallel 19, thence in a straight line to the intersection of parallel 18 with the violet line* 5 0 Though it is not perhaps within the term of reference attention may be drawn to thedesirability of modification of the violet line in our favour between Beihan and the neighbourhood of the Sei’ara 6 9 The evidence on which we have to base our case is fully described in these reports and the maps accompanying them* ( Signed) H, INGRAMS.

It soon became plain from the experiences of the Royal Air Force when visiting the Hadhramaut that the Mukalla. shoe was very far from being accurate and it is now generally recog nised that the map produced by Dr, Von Wissmann in 1932 is at present the best available map of the country. It was compiled not only from nis own route survey but from ail other available sources, which are given at pages xv to xvi of Van der Meulen s book 'Hadhramaut some of its mysteries unveiled.' Von Wissmann ana Van der Meulen, however, in their journey to the Hadhramaut did not penetrate north oi the main valley or east of Qa.br Hud, and for the country to the north Imam Sharif's map remained the onig authority as far as Qabr Salih and al Had in the Wadi Ser. Coionej. Boscawen in the course of one of his journeys to the country went up in this direction to Ba Rumeidan and through the Wadi Eiwa to the sands but he made no route traverse of his journey and has writtennothing about it. I was able to obtain some oral information from him on the country and he undertook to write me further details but unfortunately he has failed to do so, pleading, as an excuse for not writing about the subject that he is unable to spell. In these circumstances the only authorities for the country north of the main Wadi Hadhramaut are my own route traverse and the Air Force reconnaissance made also in November 1934, Owing to lack of time I was unable to travel further north of the main Wadi than I did but I collected information and took notes of the distances of other places and their bearings and this information has been used in corn- pi 1 i ng the s e m rp s. For the country south east of Qabr Hud there was also no prior authority and the Wadi Maseila. has been shown on all the maps as a conventional curve until Flight Lieutenant Rickards’ sketch map gave a better idea of what its shape vi^as. My route traverse down it is no doubt more accurate than was IDOssibie in an air reconnaissance without photographs and gave the names of the various villages, Wadis, and shabs as well as enabling me to record the boundaries of the various tribes. For the interior of the Mahra. country east of Seihut to Ras Dharbut ’Ali there is as yet no authority. The Admiralty chart gives the coast and when Mr. Betram Thomas started his journey across the Rub’ al Khali he began by flanking the mouths of some of the Waais of the Mahra country that run into the sands. Apart from these two sources there is only the verbal information collected by myself at Seihut and Mur- bat, and by Captain Hickinbotham and myself at Qishn. The maps accompanying this note are intended to illustrate all the recent informstioru As a first steg to their .compila tion the map which forms Annex C ol the Anglo— Tumish Con vention of 1914 and Mr.Bertram Thomas’ map were photographed by the photographic section of No .8 Bombing Squadron enlarged to a common scale and superimposed on each other. -11-The area covered by the 1 inch = 18 miles map w-s then enlarged to that scale and the coast line corrected by reference to the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Pilot and the Admiralty chart Ras al Kalb to Herb at. In the course of this correction v/e found that we had made a number of mistakes and so redrew the map. It has now a grid north. I took Mr. Bertram Thomas’ map as being good authority for the position of the Wadis whose mouths were fairly close to his line of march and for the line separating the steppe from the sand in that area. The Wadis Thuf eastwards are therefore placed as they appear on his map. Prom my own information it was obvious that the Wadi Eiwat as Sei ’ ar was much too far to the east on his map and it seemed that the same was the case with the Wadi Eiwat al Manahil. My 1 inch = 1 mile traverse was then reduced to 1 inch = 18 miles and traced on. When the Mukalla end of it was placed on the position of that port as shown on the chart the Seihut end also coincided with its chart position. The positions of Shibam, Tarim,, and Qa.br Hua very nearly approximated to those given on Von Weissmann’s map and on Plight Lieutenant Rickards’ sketch map. Air Commodore Portal had plotted his air reconnais sance ( vide Aden Despatch No. 318 of 5th December 1934) on the millionth Mukalla sheet (a tracing is appended to this note) and this was reduced to 1 inch = 18 miles and traced on. It served also as a check on the position of Qa al Fadhul for the position of ’’cultivation and houses'’ coincided with Qa al Padhul and there was no other place within miles that would have been an alternative. The names of the places I obtained at Qa al Fadhul^ were then plotted on the map s.% the distances and bearings given me. 12 miles in a straight line/ was allowed for a days’ journey. &amp; Report on Car and Caravan Routes page 69. / This is an underestimate for travelling over flat plateau land but about right for travelling over broken Wadi country. For this reason I consider that the distances to the places north of Qa al Fadhul are probably underestimated but I have left them like this to avoid exaggeration.

Che sources of the neighbouring Wadis of Mar?/a iviakhiaj, and ’.Aram were plotted in the same way and made of about the same length as the Wadi Eiwa/ xhe boundaries of the Manahil tribe in the Wadi Maseila were obtained accurately and continued north from hearsay. The Wadi Eiwat al Manahil was then placed in the east of their ^eriitoiy. xne remaining Wadis from Mr. Bertram Thomas’ map were then placed east and west of the Wadi Eiwat al Manahil. This of course is very rough work and I think probably that the Wadi Eiwat al Manahil and the next three to the west of it should if anything be further to the west/ These inter tribal boundaries, however, do not affect the main question of the extent of these steppe land northwards. I will be seen that the position of the line dividing the steppe from the sand rested on something rather better Report on Car and Caravan Routes, pages 5 and 5 . E.

It was assumed^ not altogether unjustifiably^ that a line joining these extremities represented trie approximate state of affairs in between the two. The borders of the desert are approximately known to the west of the Sei’ar country towards Beihan and it seems probable that the edge of the steppe does run gradually in an east-north-easterly direction to beyond the eastern boundary of the Protec tor at e. As regards tribal boundaries generally on the north western part of this map 5 they were found accurately where- ever my line of march crossed them and produced in the di rections indicated by various informants.

For what distance these tribes actually look on the desert bordering the steppe as their own exclusive property I do not know 3 but I have little doubt that anybody penetrating within a certain distance of the steppe country would be looked on as a trespasser. In talking with the Sei’ars about their boundaries I formed the impression that s while they were quite definite about those in the Wadis (ji n fact 3 as I have shown&gt; they could tell from one step to another where the boundary lay) 3 in the desert a sense of tribal property in the land gradu ally diminished the deeper one penetrated, 'until one came into an area which was a common playground for all.

[E 4486/318/25] Record of Sixth Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza at the Foreign Office on July 18, 1935. THE following were present at the Mr. Rendel. Sir A. Ryan. Mr. Ward. Mr. Malcolm. meeting :— Fuad Bey Hamza (Deputy Saudi Arabian Minister for Eoreiom Affairs). b Sheikh Hafiz Wahba (Saudi Arabian Minister in London). inis was the final meeting of the series, and the opportunity was taken to review the position reached as a result of the earlier conversations, and to decide the procedure to be followed in future negotiations. on I. Mr. RENDEL opened the meeting by recalling the present position in the negotiations about the frontiers of the Saudi Kingdom in Eastern and South- Eastern Arabia. His Majesty’s Government were now in possession of the detailed information supplied by Fuad Bey in his letter of the 2nd July and his memorandum of the 8th July in support of the boundary claimed by King Abdul Aziz. This information had been passed on to the British authorities in the Bersian Gulf and m the Aden Protectorate, who would now devote themselves to a thorough examination of the Saudi case. The eventual conclusions of His Majesty s Government would be largely based upon the reports they received Horn these authorities but he could assure Fuad Bey that the claims of King Abdul Aziz would receive full and fair consideration. FUAD FEY HAMZA said that he would like to take this opportunity to mention that the names given in his letter and subsequent memorandum were not only of wells, but also of places and districts. As the names had been obtained trom Bedouin tribesmen, it would obviously be impossible to find many of them on tfie maps, borne of the wells and places mentioned were, however, close to the Gatar peninsula or the coast of the Persian Gulf and were quite well known. Mr. RENDEL then concluded the discussion of the south-eastern frontiers y informing Fuad Bey that the reply of His Majesty’s Government to his two communications would be returned to the Saudi Government in due course through His Majesty’s Legation at Jedda. 6 II. The discussion then turned to the question of the Bahrein transit dues. Mr .RENDEL said that he feared it would not be possible to prepare draft notes embodying the agreement reached at the local conference in time for them to be shown to Puad Bey before he left England on the 22nd July. The wording of the letter from the Bahrein delegation detailing the concessions their Govern ment was prepared to make to Saudi Arabia was not entirely clear in some respects, and it would probably be necessary for the draft notes to be referred to the Government of Bahrein for concurrence before they were communicated to the Saudi Government. At the same time Mr. Rendel wished to repeat the formal assurance he had given I uad Bey at their previous meeting that the Government of Bahrein would not at any future time again penalise ships (like the s.s. Ahmedi) calling at Bahrein and carrying cargo direct to the mainland of Arabia without tranship ment m Bahrein waters. His Majesty’s Government intended to confirm this perpetual assurance m a separate note to be addressed to the Saudi Government at the time of the main exchange of notes. [456 y—1]FUAD BEY HAMZA explained that he had not received any recent instructions from his Government about this question, and so was not m a position to do more than take note of what Mr. Rendel said. He suggested, how ever that it might be useful if he were to see the draft notes before they were formally communicated to the Saudi Government for their concurrence. After further discussion it was agreed that as soon as the draft notes had been approved by His Majesty’s Government and the Government of Bahrein, copies of them should be sent to Sheikh Hafiz Wahba for onward transmission to Fuad Bey Hamza, wherever he might then be m the course of his leave^ At the same time the draft notes would be sent to His Majesty s Charge d Affaires at Jedda who would be instructed to communicate them formally to the Saudi Government for their concurrence, as soon as Fuad Bey Hamza had expressed his personal agreement with the terms employed in the drafts. III. Mr. RENDEL next referred to the debt due from the Saudi Government to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. He explained that His Majesty’s Government had no desire to embarrass the Saudi Government by raising this matter; but their position, too, was not easy since they were liable to criticism in Parliament and by the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons if steps were not taken with a view to liquidating the debt. His Majesty’s Government had learned with much satisfaction of the repayment by the Saudi Government last May of their half share of the cost of the enquiry conducted by Mr. Macdonell in 1931 into the rival claims arising out of tribal raids between Transjordan and the Hejaz and Nejd, and of their payment of 10 per cent, of the capital of the larger debt for £31,437 4.9. 6&lt;Y due on account of arms and ammunition supplied to King Ibn Sand in 1929. His Majesty’s Government would now be grateful to learn the intentions of the Saudi Govern ment in regard to the repayment of the remainder of the arms debt, and he was authorised to inform Fuad Bey that if satisfactory arrangements could be made for the repayment of the outstanding 90 per cent, of the capital of the debt within a reasonable period, His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to take a sympathetic view of the question of interest on the debt. FUAD BEY HAMZA replied that he would look into the matter with a view to producing a statement of the intentions of his Government about the repayment of the remainder of the debt. IV. The next matter to be touched upon was the future of the Treaty of Jedda, and the connected questions of slavery and the traffic in arms. Mr. RENDEL said that he was now authorised to inform Fuad Bey that His Majesty’s Government would be prepared in principle to extend the validity of the Treaty of Jedda for a further seven years by means of an exchange of notes, on the lines already suggested by Fuad Bey, provided that a satisfactory settle ment were reached on the question of slavery and the other outstanding points of less importance. SIR A. RYAN pointed out that in his draft exchange of notes Fuad Bey had suggested prolonging the treaty for ten years. Mr. RENDEL replied that he had mentioned seven years because that was the period of validity of the original treaty. He thought that neither His Majesty’s Government nor the Saudi Government were ready just yet to conclude a new treaty, and, in the circumstances, he agreed with Fuad Bey that there would be advantage in stabilising relations between their two countries by prolonging the existing treaty for a definite term of years. As a new treaty would probably be a subject for negotiation before very long, he thought seven years might be a sufficient period. At the same time, there would, of course, be no question of the treaty automatically expiring at the end of the seven years, as it would continue to run on indefinitely, as at present, subject to denunciation at six months’ notice.FUAD BEY suggested that the treaty might be prolonged for ten years unless a new treaty were negotiated in the meanwhile. 7 j- n f w NDE f, t nd SI ?- A -. RYAN thought that this was a useful formula, 'Government 16 C ° U d de n ° °^3 ec t 10n 5 and agreed to recommend it to His Majesty’s The discussion then turned to the question of slavery and manumission in relation to the prolongation of the treaty. c. MENDEL reminded Fuad Bey that the whole question of the renewal o± the treaty hinged on a settlement being reached on this issue which would be satisfactory from the point of view of their respective Governments. He under- “ rom ^ lr A - Ryan that his private discussions with Fuad Bey had shown mat there was a good prospect of agreement, although there were still a few points outstanding about which Sir Andrew was not entirely happy, particularly e reluctance of Fuad Bey to agree to make the clause in the regulations anording redress to persons who could show that they had been illegally enslaved m the past, applicable to persons enslaved prior to the establishment of the present regime m the Hejaz. If Sir A. Ryan felt any doubts about the adequacy t? ^ e J^ aver y regulations which the Saudi Government were proposing to issue. Fuad Bey could be sure that they would not satisfy public and parliamentary opinion in this country when it became necessary for His Majesty’s Government to justify the surrender of their right of manumission. FUAD BEY observed that His Majesty’s Government were not alone in experiencing difficulties over the slavery question. He had only received very general instructions from King Abdul Aziz to guide him in his negotiations on tiie subject, and he feared that in his discussions with Sir Andrew Rvan he might already have gone too far and be unable to obtain approval for the concessions he had offered. He begged His Majesty’s Government to realise that Iving Abdul Aziz held himself to reckon with the force of public opinion m regard to slavery, which was an ancient and established institution in Arabia, sanctified by Islamic law and tradition. His Majesty would have to consult his tribal and religious leaders, and they might well, if only from motives of self-interest, refuse to agree to the fai-reaching measures that were now proposed. Fuad Bey pointed out that, in introducing reforms on the subject of slavery, King Abdul Aziz would have to contend with a mass of vested interests, as well as with the religious feelings of important sections of the population. Mr. RENDEL and SIR ANDREW RYAN replied that they fully appreciated the difficulties that confronted King Abdul Aziz and the Saudi Government and were most anxious that His Majesty should, if possible, obtain the prior consent of the ulema and the tribal leaders before introducino' the proposed reforms. &amp; Mr. RENDEL desired, however, to point out that His Majesty’s Government were only asking King Abdul Aziz to carry out certain reforms that were, in any case, inevitable before very long, if, as they hoped, Saudi Arabia were to continue to maintain its present rate of progress under the enlightened rule of His Majesty and to take its proper international place in the modern world. The indefinite continuance of slavery as an institution was not possible in the conditions of the present day, and he cited the trouble which Abyssinia was experiencing through the continuance of slavery within her borders. He begged Fuad Bey to submit to King Abdul Aziz the result of his conversations with Sir Andrew Ryan on the subject of slavery, and to try to obtain from His Majesty some definite and far-reaching proposals which could be laid before Ministers here as a satisfactory counterpart to the surrender of the right of manumission. Once agreement had been reached on the question of slavery, nothing would stand in the way of the Treaty of Jedda being prolonged. FUAD BEY promised to do his best to produce as soon as possible the final proposals of his Government. It was agreed that when these were available they would be submitted to Ministers without delay, and a communication containing the views of His Majesty’s Government would then be made to the Saudi Government through His Majesty’s representative at Jedda. The discussion then turned to the question of the prolongation or modification of the exchange of notes (Nos. 5 and 6) at the time of the signature of the Treaty of Jedda in regard to purchases of arms by the Saudi Government. [456 y—1] B 2SIR ANDREW RYAN reminded Fuad Bey that this matter had been discussed at the fourth meeting on the 5th July, when it had been agreed that it involved points of form, rather than of substance. He had now been able to go into the question more deeply, in consultation with the competent Department of the Foreign Office. There were two difficulties connected with the note written by Sir G. Clayton at the time of the conclusion of the Treaty of Jedda. That note referred to the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925, and the reference implied certain qualifications of the assurance contained in it. That convention was now, however, dead, and a new agreement was in contemplation, which existed only in draft form. There would be no new regulation, Sir A. Ryan understood, providing for special zones, but, on the other hand, the question of possible restrictions on the supply of arms in abnormal circumstances had attracted increasing attention. It' would be necessary to devise a new formula more in accordance with these developments than that embodied in the original note. Mr. RENDER explained that the position was that it would be necessary for His Majesty’s Government to qualify their assurance on the arms traffic in order to bring it into line with any existing or impending international commitments by which they might be bound, but that any such qualification would be one of purely general application. There would be no question of discrimination against Saudi Arabia as such. FUAD BEY thanked Sir Andrew Ryan and Mr. Rendel for the explanations they had given. He said that he had, however, been uneasy at hearing Mr. Rendel at the fourth meeting on the 5th July, state that His Majesty’s Government did not intend to treat the Saudi Government “in a less favourable way than any other friendly country in a similar position.” He thought that the expression “ in a similar position ” might imply discrimination. Mr. RENDEL replied that he had been obliged to use the words quoted by Fuad Bey on account of the provisions in the 1925 Arms Traffic Convention establishing “ special zones ” in different parts of the world, within which the signatory countries bound themselves to sell arms only to Governments or their accredited agents, on account of the risk of any sale of arms to warlike and turbulent tribal elements leading to unrest and possible revolts. He realised that zones of this nature did imply a certain discrimination, but he pointed out that it was essentially in the interests of the Governments of countries within the zones that there should be a prohibition of the private import of arms and ammunition. He understood from Sir Andrew Ryan, who had been in touch with the experts on the suoject at the Foreign Office, that it was unlikely that any future Arms Traffic Convention would contain provision for “ special zones.” Nevertheless, he felt obliged to make a reservation on the point, as it was still possible that some alternative system might eventually be adopted by which certain groups or categories of countries should be subject to special ^regulations. He repeated, however, that there would be no question of discrimination against Saudi Arabia as such. FUAD BET remarked that the Saudi Government were naturally more anxious than anybody else that arms should not be supplied illicitly to private individuals in their country. But they did not like any form of discrimination, and they could only agree to safeguards such as those underlying the idea of “ special zones ” if they were embodied in general terms applying to the world as a whole.

X A Paragraphs 3 and 4 of my telegram T/194 of August 30th* I have received the following very useful information obtained by Dickson from bedouin friends with Al Morrah connections * 2* Dickson * s chief informant (who has been checked from other sources) knows personally, or has good hearsay knowledge of, the following wells in the list attached to Fuad 1 s note dated the 8 th July 1935 - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 , 8 , 10, 15, 16, 17, 21, 23, 24, 26, 31, 32, 52, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 81, 82, 83, 86 , 87, 88 , 92, 94, 97, 106, 107, 116, 117, 121, 123, 157, 158, 159, 161. The informant states that the Al Morrah tribal area Cdira) stretches South in the form of a rough elongated parallelogram from close to Hoffuf down to the v/ells of Shanna, Mamura, Zuwaira and Turaiwa (see Philby's map and point furthest south which he reached, also Thomas’ map), and is more or less encrlosed in the area bounded by the following.

From Hoffuf down the eastern side of the Summan plateau to Muqainama wells leaving the whole of the Jabrin ©as is to the Mar rah. From Maqainama wells the boundary goes by a curved line south-east to Shanna wells, (see Philby's and Thomas 1 maps). (k) Northern Boundary runs south-east approximately along the line of wells (see Philby*s map) known as Zanurqa, Sir al Nabit, Bahath, Bir A^ila, round the southern edge of the Qatar boundary to Sabkhat Matti (see Thomas' map) a marshy stip running some 40 miles into the interior from the sea coast. (c) Eastern Boundary runs from the Sabkhat Matti in a south-easterly straight line to 'Sabkhat Mijora' at the junction of the parallels 54° and 2CP. (d) Southern Boundary . From Sabkhat Mijora to Shaima wells, and includes the Al Rashid tribal country. (Al Rashid are kin of the Morrah, and an offshoot of the tribe of that name living in Hajran). 3. Dickson's informant also states that east of the Sabkhat Matti lies the Manasir tribal country, which in similar fashion extends right south to the Al Ramla (heavy sands) keeping the Morrah 'dira' on their west. Similarly to the east of the Manasir 'dira', lies the ^wamir tribal country known as the Dhafrah, and so on to the various tribes lying west of Jabal Akhdar, all of whom have a wedge of territory running into the heart of the 'Ramla'. The Morrah, being Sunni, have little to do with the Manasir ana avoid them and their country anc|do not marry with them, for the reason that, though of good stock, they (the Manasir) follow the Khawarij creed, which was something akin to the Shi'ah belief and so abhorrent. &lt;- Jkft-3- ♦will follow as | soon,-as repi^auced. 4. DicKSon lias plotted this information in a rough map, of which a copy is enclosed, 5. Dickson has formed the opinion that Bin 3a*ud ana bii. -Jiluwi today exercise entire and real authority over all the Al Morrah and, though not in a direct sense, over the whole of their country. He explains that this indirect control is exercised in the following way. The nl Morrah, also other tribes for that matter, cannot hope to exist during the summer months in the Hub* al Khali region or in any part of it. They must move north to more congenial climes, where they can graze and water their camels daily. Such places they find in the great Jabrin Oasis (essentially their own headquarters) and round about Hoffuf. That is the time when Bin Sa'ud taxes them and takes n zakat M . In the winter and spring and immediately after rain has fallen in the Hub’ al Khali, out go the Morrah, and they dis appear and scatter among the sandy wastes, until it is time to come north again for the summering period. Bin Sa’ud has, therefore, never to bother to send out tax-gatherers further than Hoffuf and Jabrin. On the other hand, should a Shaikh be wanted in the spring grazing season, a single man (fidawi) or tribal employee of Bin Sa’ud has but to move down to where the tribe is grazing, and he soon finds his man. A verbal order from him does the rest. No man dare disobey such messenger’s summons, as it is as much as his life is worth to do so* He knows he will be ’’got” when summer comes like a bird walking into a cage. Should the Manasir, M.wamir or other neighbouring tribe start raiding the Morrah, so as to become a nuisance (this can only happen in the winter and spring), then it is up to Bin Sa’ud or bin Jiluwi to send a 'ghazza” to assist them deal with /CONFIDENTIAL. 275 No. 702-S of 1935. ?'&gt; rr 6570 | plime^ tf &gt;n ’ bIe Residcnt in tl)e Gulf presents his com. 1.

From Banaiyan eastwards we are prepared to concede up to the Brown Line and in the last resort up to the Blue Line* The Saudi claim is represented by the Red Line. In the coastal area this claim, from our point of view, is quite impossible. We cannot give away Khor A1 Odeid, Aqal and Sabakhah Matti:are 'by no To the East, hov/ever, the Saudi claims means so impossible, and it does not seem to me to matter much how many more hundreds of square miles of desert Ibn Saud gets, provided this added territory is from the coast and does not infringe on the Muscat Sultanate* iaking these various factors into consideration the line I have marked in pencil on the map might represent our last offer. It heads Ibn Saud off from the coast where he wants to go, hut gives him all he wants from point 22 °N on the map to 19 ° 1 T. I do not know whether these points infringe on Muscat territory.

Dear Cowell, Will you please refer to your letter of 30th June regarding the Eastern boundary of the Aden Pro tec tor ate, 2. I agree that the actual point of the promontory at Has Dharbat 'All has been fixed as the boundary point aivldlng the coastal line between the territories of the sultan of Muscat and the Aden Protectorate, and fixing the respective jurisdictions of the Persian Gulf and Aden Residencies, 3. But the remark in paragraph 8 of my despatch referred more to the inland boundary between the two countries which has not yet been delimitated. 1 under stand that Ras Dharbat 'All is a high rocky headland the possession of which might be of some importance to either the Mahris or 'Omanis and I am of opinion that, as in the case of a river bed which, in Arabia, forms an unsuitable tribal or international boundary and should be definitely assigned to one or other of the adjoining tribes or countries, so, with a prominent feature such as Ras Dharbat 'All the building of a fort on whose summit might be of considerable defensive benefit to the owner, the actual headland should be left either on the Mahri or 'Omani side. 4.

A note wLicL endeavours briefly to suirffiarise tne history of the discussions which have taken place with the saudi Government on the question'd the Blue Line is flagged below. The present minute deals with the discussions which have taken place on this subject since 24th June with Fuad Bey Hamza, with the claims which have been put forward by Fuad Bey on behalf of the Saudi authorities, and the position which has now been reached. It will be seen that Fuad continues to press the Saudi claim to an area more or less ^identical with that enclosed by the Red Line on the map attached; that he presses his claim in particular to Banaiyan; and that he has adduced a quantity of evidence in support of his suggestion that the Murra trice, whose allegiance is, of course, claimed by ibn ! Sauu, nola a very large number of wells in tne central Desert. The sauai Government continues to urge that the frontier should be delimited on the basis of tribal allegiance and of tribal grazing grounds and tne areas claimed by it are claimed on this basis. H.L.g. on their side continue to take the line that the legal position arising out of the 1913/14 Conventions cannot be ignored; that weight must also be given to the various commitments into which H.M.G. have from time to time entered with the sheikh of Abu Dhabi and other rulers, and that while willing ;t° make substantial concessions in the interest of /riendly relations with ibn saud and of an agreed jsettlement of this vexed question, they are not prepared to go beyond a certain point. Discussion has in particular centred on the well at Banaiyan 2956 6000 7/2 4- 2 - and on the Saudi claim to an outlet to the sea on the eastern extremity of the Q,atar Peninsula, which would involve the attribution to them oi the Khor-al-Odeid, of part, if not the whole, of the district oi AQal, and of part of the Sabakhat Matti* 2. The Foreign Office letter of 12th July asks for immediate observations as to the reply to oe given to Fuad Hamza* I explained to Mr* Rendel that it out of the question to reach a decision on this question before 22nd July, when Fuad Hamza leaves fiiiufe f this country; that the right course at the present stage seems to be to refer the material which has been received from Fuad to the Persian Gulf for expert examination; to review the general policy to be adopted by H.M.G. in the light of the report received consequent on such examination from our local officers, say in next September or October; and to form a conclusion as to the basis on which discussions are to proceed, if at all, on the results of such consideration. I have also said that we einnot agree to any weakening of our attitude on the question of Banaiyan at this stage. 3. The points for consideration seem to be the following: (a) The steps to be taken to check the information ootained from Fuad Hamza. (o) The attitude to be adopted as regards Banaiyan in the light of the reports received from the Political Resident; (c) Aqal f ^nd the Khbr-al-Odeid. (d) The general basis on which our handling Ox this question is to proceed in the light of the conversations which have taken with fe * 7 * 1 /?r oiad, plac e- 3 - Minute Paper. Department. Ilf kijtij} J h 2956 6000 7/:H 4. As regards the first of these points, reference is invited to a minute dated 10th July hy Mr. hendel, 1 .lagged y, in which he suggests that Mr. Bertram Thomas might he temporarily employed to carry out enquiries and investigations on the spot, l confess that I am much attracted by the suggestion that some officer with a fluent knowledge of Arabic ana first hand experience of tribal conditions in this area should investigate matters. With the exception of Colonel Dickson, our officers in the Persian Gulf have none of them, unfortunately, the linguistic equipment (even if they could be spared from their ordinary duties) to enable them to do this. On the other hand, Mr. Thomas is at the moment either in the United states or in Peking and is unlikely to be available for some ■jimc, while considerations of expense might well be formidable. A possible alternative would be to employ Captain Gerald de Gaury.a British Service officer with a quite unusual knowledge of Arabic, who has for some y^ars past oeen serving as a special service Officer in Iraq, and who is at the moment employed at Jeada as an Attache to the negation with a view to writing up the Inuelligence Beport on Arabia. Captain de Gaury has, I understand, just done a secret journey with the concurrence of the Saudi Government across toe assert irom Jedda via Riyadh to Koweit. He is a highly tramea intelligence officer with a fluent knowledge | °f Aral:ilc ^ wltn Precisely toe type of qualification j A ' llicn woula make alm useful in investigations such as |the present, it woula, apart from this, be very much cheaper to employ a serving officer such as Captain de uaury than to offer special terms to Mr. Thomas. But one/6/ r - 4 - one difficulty is that the fact that he is at present employed as an Attache' at the JedcLa Legation might give rise to some awkwardness with the Saudi Government. I suggest that the question needs further consideration; hut that the possibility of using Captain de Gaury, at any rate for explorations in the no-rth , shoula not he ruled out; and that unless it is possible to make contact with hr. Ihornas we should sound the Foreign Office as to their willingness to agree to his employment. 5* As regards (h) - Banal/an. Please see the telegram on P.Z.2594/35 below to the Political Resiaent, and his reply of 10th July. The information obtained by the Political Agent, Bahrein, shows that if we are to deal with this question on the basis of user ty tribes etc. ion 3aud coulu make a very strong case in regard to 3anaiyon, though not to the well at sufak. In the light of the report in question I think that we mayjiave to he prepared to recognise the Sami claim to Banaiyan. But I suggest that it would he preferable to do so only as part of a general settlement and that it is most important to avoid accepting tribal user as the basis of any concession, in view of the-very extensive claims which could with some plausibility be aavancea by the Saudi Government if this basis was once eccepteu b,y '• 1 — '* Ike great importance which the Saudis clearly attach to a title to Banaiyan may help US ’ 11 1216 neSOtiatlons P^ed, to obtain a withdrawal oi their claims (which we cannot in any event admit) to ACia1 ’ the ^r-al-Qdeid, the sabakhat hatti, and the m out hern portion of Ontur in r*p+nr»n -p ^ . n return tor the abandonment on our part of Banaiyan. i\A,U Iv L J' / &amp;Paper.

We have, apart from this, formally recognised the Khor-al-Odeia as appertaining to the sneilm of Ahu Dhabi, and A«ial ana me Sabakhat intti appear also to have been recognised by us as part of his territories. The sheikh may not exercise a very close control over either area. But they are not by any mearn in the same position as areas in me remote hinterluna ana it seems essential to continue to refuse to make any concession to Saudi Arabia regarding them, rne foreign Office agree as to this ana think that they nave shaken Fuad Hamza in the recent discussions. That may be so.

We are laced with two alternatives - first, to i-axe our stand on me legal position, with me knowledge that the doctrine of res null ins may to some extent . demine us; second, to deal with the natter on nie oo.Uul basis of tribal allegiance and tribal grazing grounds. It is perhaps unfortunate that the Foreign Office in the recent discussions have taken the sauai claim that tribal user should be the basis of settlement so seriously. The objections to it, wmch still seem to me to have great force, are, of course, the migratory character of the tribes, the changes which take place In the location of grazing grounds/r ' . i - 6 &gt; grounds, tiie extreme uncertainly of tlie reality of such allegiance as they may owe to Ihn 3aua, and the undesirability of founding a territorial settlement which may he of some considerable duration on transitory payments of blackmail or insurance to the Saudi King by tribes which for practical purposes are entirely out of his reach and out of his control. The best course on the whole seems to be to continue to base ourselves on the legal position and to make up our minds as to the point beyond which we are prepared to let negotiations break down, rather than make any formal territorial concession. For the reasons given above we might, I think, as part of a general settlement, give way about Banaiyan. But no compromise is possible about the Khor-al-Cdeid, AQal,. the Sahakhat Patti and the southern boundary of Qatar, and while the Central Desert is not of much importance to anyone, there is a great deal to he said for making no concession beyona the ciotted Blue Line on the map. The question of the concessions to he made in the southern area is one primarily for the Colonial Off ice.At is just possible tfi-t we might have to reconsider a reversion to the insert Zone solution, the adoption of which would involve less loss of face by the Sauuls. But the Desert Zone would help us only in the Central Desert; we shouia solll have to dispose of the Saudi claims to ^ ae fthor-al-Gdeid, etc. 8 - For Trio nomont, I suggest that we might write to tt.

One 0 f toe principal questions at present in issue between Saudi Arabia and h.L.g. i s the eastern and uutnern territorial boundary of the dominions of Saudi Aracia. Tne Sauai Arabian dynasty is the successor in title or the Ottoman Umpire whose eastern and southern limits were defined in two Conventions concluded in 1915 and 1914 by a Blue Line and a VMet Line respectively on the map attached to those Conventions. The Blue Line £^..-f r 2 y he ileaQ of tiae Gul£ opposite Zaknuniyah Island0 CTo the SOth Parallel of Latitude in the Central Arabian Desert; the Violet Line from the point where the Blue Line met the 20th Parallel to the south-western extremity of the Arabian Peninsula. H.M.G. aamit no territorial claim ior themselves to the area to the east of the Violet Line* and they have been interested in the matter solely because the rulers to the east and south of thor*c. linejare, without exception, in special treaty relations with them. Those rulers are, on the Persian Gulf coast, Qatar, Abu Dhabi and the remaining Trucxal sheikhs, and kuscat. In Southern Arabia they are the various sheikhs ana sultans of the Hadramaut and the Aden Protectorate. The present note deals with the question primarily from the point of view of the Persian Gulf, which is the aspect of the matter of most interest to the India Office. H.M.G. up to quite recently have been^oiTBDlhed' solely with the maintenance of the maritime peace and have abstained (save in the case of Qatar) from undertaking any commitment in respect of the hinterland. The hinterland boundaries of the various Sheikhdoms in special treaty/. fnever uweii treaty relations with them in this area nave defined and the houndaries even between sheikhdom and sheikhdom have irom time to tiiiieVaried considerably. The questiun vl- the hinterlana, most of which is barren aesert, peopled by nonaaic tribes, whose numbers are smai: ana wno are for practical purposes independent of any control, was, until two or three years ago, of no practical interest to anyone, ibn saua, the descendant of the 'Wahabi amirs, who had established himself as the. ruler of Nejd and Hasa between 1904 and 1921 was to all intents the only claimant to any influence over the xemoter tribes of the Central Desert, and such influence as he exercised appears to have been due rather to the desire of the tribes to effect an insurance against one anotner than to any effective control by ibn Saud. oil was, However, ^covere^loWg in one Island el Bahreini American interests began^aCtmiy to explore an oil concession granted them in Hasa; an oil concession was suosequently granted in Koweit; there seemed reason to believe that oil might be found in productive quantities m Qatar (and a concession in respect of toe peninsula has now been granted to toe I.P.C.); and rumours of oil along' tne Trucial Coast began to spread, in these circumstances tne cluestl0Q ownership of toe hinterland became one of active importance both to Ibn Saud and to H.M.G. To Ibn saud it was of additional importance, since an y * challenge by H.M.G. to toe vague authority which he had hitherto exercised or at any me claimed in toe central Desert affected his prestige.3- Negotiation^ H.M.G. are advised that in law they are on hood grouriu in maintaining the Blue ana violet Lines of the 1913 and 1914 Conventions against Ihn 3aud, subject, however, to the important reservation that in lo iar as it may be impossible either for h.M.G. themselves or ior their various Arab proteges to point to the effective exercise of authority or control in the area to the east and south of the Blue ana violet Lines it is arguable that the area over which no such authority is exercised is i^s_riullius, and that no exception can in these circumstances be taken to its peaceful penetration or even to the establishment of a formal claim to it base on oucii peaceful penetration by ibn Saud, H.M.G. have formally intimated to Ibn gaud that the, regara him as bound by the Blue and violet Lines of the 191o ana 1914 Conventions, fliey have made a similar communication to the sheikh of %atar and to the United States Government (who are interested in the matter because it is an American Company which has a concession ior the Hasa oil deposits), ibn saud has taken the strongest exception to the suggestion that he is bouna by the 1913 and 1914 Conventions, partly because it appears he greatly dislikes anything which suggests that he was ever a Turkish vassal; partly because acceptance of the Blue and Violet Lines must affect his prestige in Central Arabia and may operate to his detriment if oil should be found m the areas to the east and south of those lines. It is to the interests of both parties to reach a reasonable agreed solution and the matter has thus formed part oi the comprehensive negotiations which have recently oeen proceeding with a view to the settlement of an outstanding questions between H.M.G. and Saudi Arabia.a. H.M.G. have throughout been conscious that the weakness of their case is the tact that their protege's, at any rate in. the Persian Gulf, exercise a real influence only within a relatively narrow fringe along the coast-line that they ao not themselves wish to acquire any territorial dominion in Northern Arabia with the responsibilities which its acquisition would place upon them; and that since the rulerfof the coast are unlikely to be in a position to assert efiective authority to any depth in the Central Desert,the doctrine of res nullius referred to above tends t0 11)11 SaU(i,s kanas* In these circumstances, they CTTrt in the first place-at: a compromise under which Ibn Saud would be given in full sovereignty the uerritories oounded by the Green Line on the. map attached, fhey wiiuinnllff contemplated that if the King should regard this as inadequate a proposal should be put forward to him for the establishment of a so-called Desert Zone, over which neither Saudi Arabia nor H.M.G. ana their PxOoegus should claim jurisdiction or sovereignty and which would be open to the Nationals of both parties, fhis proposal was subsequently abandoned in favour of (a) the cession to Ibn Saud in full sovereignty o± the area bounded by a Brown Line on the map attached, to which would in the last resort be added (b) the cesshan^of an area running to Parallel 53 and shown by the dotted/^W Line on the attached map. 6. The Saudi Government for their part put forward a claim to the area, to be held in full sovereignty, bounded by a Red Line on the attached map. They admitted that in the south their claims were possibly more extensive than they coula justify, out they pressed strongly that they were on good ground in tne north.In the negotiations which followed H.M.G. have conceded the Green Line and the Brown Line areas, tut a deadlock has now teen reached. The Saudis continue to press their full claim, in particular they demand the well of Banaiyan, which is a watering place of c endue rut) le importance. While we have hitherto contended that this well belongs to the sheikh of Abu Dhabi the latest information goes to suggest that he has not in fact exercised any authority there for some years past and that it may therefore be necessary to yield it to the Saudis as part of a general frontier settlement. In da it ion, the Saudis have put forward a list of some ltd wells which, they claim, are recognised among the tribe us belonging to the Mirra tribe, the allegiance of which Ion Sauu claims and of which if is probably true to say that so far as anyone exercises influence over them - and the degree of such influence seems to be very small inueed and very transitory - it is the King of sauui Arab ia.

( 2 ) The fact that the Government of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz did v not adopt the wide principle which was the basis of her relations with the tribes of the desert which had declared their allegiance and submission to His Majesty the King as the tribes of Da-akeih, viz, A Manahil, Ahl Kathir and Ahl Mahra—and most of the tribes of ^dMaiias^AlDaru’, A 1 ’Awamir, Beni GhafiriKEoTEe^ESTwere content to mention the natural boundaries which were at the same time generally recognised by the tribes inhabitating the desert as belonging , r&gt; to the tribes on whose members and lands His Majesty’s Government « ^ has exercised direct influence for a l ong ^period, during which their ordinary members and their sHerkhs'were actually in His Maiestv’s service and His Majesty’s regular army. J J &gt; (3) His Majesty’s Government’s realisation of the extreme difficulties which may arise as a result of an unjust delineation of the frontiers and particularly the great resentment which the tribes may feel if they- were abandoned after having rendered loyal allegiance and submission all these long years and after having built their hopes for the future on the continuity of the system of government devised for them and His Majesty’s Government’s wish to keep its promise and fulfil its obligations and responsibility towards its subjects and its neighbours. 3. Having outlined to you these fundamental points, I would like to point out that the line of the frontiers which I presented to Sir Andrew Ryan does not contain any exaggeration nor^ does it leave any room for bargaining or ^ have pointed out above, due note was taken in delineating this Imer'-ST tKe tribal considerations which are generally admitted by the Bedouin population and more especially by those of them who are neutral and are therefore not interested in proving somebody’s claim or refuting it. 4. You will no doubt remember what I told you in our last two meetino-s that His Majesty’s Government fully appreciating the position delegated to me the task of checking the official data concerning the frontiers by taking the evidence of certain neutral persons among the experts of the desert.’ As a result I became convinced that the line referred to above does not exceed the true state of affairs and that the wells of Banaiyan, Sufuq, Battha and Bataihin bekum X to the Ahl Murra. &amp; 5.

My impression is that the aide which can produce the most accur ate data will eventually establish its case, but at present both the Saudis and the British authorities can do little mor-e than quote the names of wells even the existence of which in many cases i* doubtful, and produce unconfirmed and con- traci.ictory tribal reports.

CONFIDENTIAL. July 3, 1935. Section 1. [E 4126/77/91] “ &lt; F ‘'• Par ‘ sst ^ THE following were present at the meeting Mr. Rendel. Sir A. Ryan (His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda). Mr. Ward. Mr. Malcolm. Euad Bey Arabian Affairs). Sheikh Hafiz Wahba (Saudi-Arabian Minister in London). Hamza (Deputy Saudi- Minister for Foreign nffi recalled that, at the two previous meetings at the Foreien Office, discussions about the south-eastern frontiers had been confined tTth» northern portion of the proposed boundary. It would no? be pos to P r?cee? with negotiations on this part of the line until each side had had time to consider the arguments put forward by the other. He would like to nmke itXr however that His Majesty’s Government could not modifyttoir attitode Tn regard to the claims of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz in regard to Ae part of the line at the base of the Qatar Peninsula or in the region of the Khor-aLOdeid they would, however, give careful consideration to the memorandum which Fuad district * 1 pr ° miSed 0n the fi uestlon of the proper attribution of Banaiyan and its FUAD BEY HAMZA replied that he preferred to postpone further detailed discussion of the northern portion of the boundary until His Majesty’s Govern ment had studied his memorandum, which he hoped to have ready very shortly bpeakmg about the south-eastern frontier problem as a whole, he could hold out Intie hope that King Abdul Aziz would be able to accept the proposals of His Majesty s Government, since the boundary they had suggested, unlike that proposed m the memorandum communicated by Fuad Bey to Sir A. Ryan on the Ina i a ’ 1935 ’ WaS n0t based upon the existin g situation in the desert. King n-baul Aziz would no doubt be ready to give way on specific points if the facts could be shown to be otherwise than he claimed, but he could not break his pledges to those tribes who had placed themselves under his protection. Fuad Bey hoped that His Majesty’s Government would appreciate the difficulties which confronted the King—^particularly in view of his position vis-a-vis Arab national sentiment—when asked to surrender territory to which he had an established claim. Mr. RENDEL explained that His Majesty’s Government fully appreciated the position of King Abdul Aziz. But he could not accept Fuad Bey’s contention that the proposals of His Majesty’s Government were not based on the existing situation. The line they were offering was based upon facts ascertained after the most careful enquiry. He then suggested that the meeting should proceed to discuss the southern sector of the line. Since the discussions with Fuad Bey Hamza in London in September 1934, much detailed information had been obtained in regard to the allegiance and distribution of tribes in this area, and the southern sector of the line which His Majesty’s Government were now offering (running from the biter- section of the Anglo-Turkish “violet” line of 1914, and parallel 18° N. to the intersection of meridian 52° E. and parallel 19° N.) had been drawn up in conformity with this information so as to include within the Aden Protectorate the territory predominantly inhabited by the Hadhrami tribes of the Protectorate. It was true that the proposed frontier was a straight and artificial line; but this was inevitable in the case of a line running through a featureless and practically uninhabited desert, and need present no difficulties, since both parties were trying to fix the ultimate limits of territorial sovereignty and not to establish a frontier in the European sense of the word. 8025 [11839—1]FUAD BEY remarked that the drawing of the boundary in this sector would depend upon what tribes His Majesty’s Government claimed for the Hadhramaut He was understood to say that there were three important tribes in the area between the central desert and the Hadhramaut Valley—the Seiar, Karab and Jinaba—and that great authority was wielded in this region by a certain sherif w T ho was in correspondence with all the neighbouring Governments with the King of the Yemen, with the Saudi Government, and, Fuad Bey supposed, with the authorities in the Aden Protectorate. Fuad Bey explained that King Abdul Aziz did not claim the allegiance of the Seiar and the Karab, although the Imam of the Yemen might do so, but, even so, he considered that the line proposed bv His Majesty’s Government was placed much further north than could possibly be justified by the facts. Returning to the general question of the frontier as a whole, he enquired whether His Majesty’s Government would agree to a map being prepared to illustrate the habitats of the tribes in the desert, and to serve as a basis for the allocation of territory? Fuad Bey adverted to the argument he had produced at the first meeting on'the 24th June, namely, that the diras of the tribes were fixed and could be definitely ascertained by experts. Mr. RENDEL pointed out that there was a wide difference between the extreme limits within which a tribe might wander (and which would inevitably overlap with the limits of other tribes) and the actual territory within which a tribe was predominant. His Majesty’s Government had always been ready to recognise as belonging to a tribe territory in which it was unquestionably the predominant influence, but it seemed obvious that there would have to be a compromise as between the extreme limits of the various tribal diras. SIR ANDREW RYAN brought the discussion back to the southern sector ot the frontier He pointed out that in the south-east and south the line proposed An ^f^iit Azxz himself (m the memorandum communicated by Fuad Bey d Apn ’ l m5 ) Was , ltself artifici al, inasmuch as it was a straight line tW tUV e ° graP i hlC f P 0_0 f dl , nate s- 0n other hand, Fuad Bey had told him rThmr, GT n ^° n y * C ? lmed u three , tribes ( the Murr a, Beni Haiir and Dimran Ev wishlYtf P n rt °!. anotber (the Manasir) in the Ruba-al-Khali.

His Majesty’s Government were jus4 elaborate his views. Apart from these considerations, Mr. Rendel felt that the claims put forward in the Saudi memorandum of last April were so extensive on the south and south-east, and included so vast an area which was manifestly outside the dominions of King Abdul Aziz, that little would be gained by criticising it in detail. He could say at once that His Majesty’s Government would never be able to agree to concessions on so immense a scale involving the cession of territory belonging to rulers to whom they were bound by ancient treaties. Moreover, the Saudi claims in the south and the south-east were merely defined in the memorandum, and were not supported by any detailed information such as would be essential if they were to be subjected to detailed criticism. Another point was that the tribes claimed by King Abdul Aziz in the Ruba-al- Khali were (on Fuad Bey’s own statement to Sir A. Ryan) only three and part of a fourth in number, whereas the tribes of the Hadhramaut were very numerous. It would therefore be much simpler for the Saudi Government to state the limits which they claimed for the diras of their three and a half tribes than for His Majesty’s Government to produce a detailed exposition of the rights of the tribes of the Aden Protectorate and of the other rulers concerned. SIR ANDREW RYAN then joined Mr. RENDEL in urging Fuad Bey to accept the line which His Majesty’s Government had now offered— i.e., from the intersection of the “ violet ” line of 1914 and parallel 18 to the intersection of meridian 52 and parallel 19—as a basis of negotiation, and to obtain and supply a detailed statement of the views of the Saudi Government upon it. FUAD BEY insisted that the line proposed by the Saudi Government in fact followed as closely as possible the limits of the diras of the tribes he had mentioned to Sir A. Ryan in April as owing allegiance to King Abdul Aziz. He suggested that it was unreasonable to ask for a further statement regarding them, and lepeated that King Abdul Aziz would not be able to give way on anv part of the line he claimed. But, after a long further discussion, he eventuallv agreed to meet the lequest of the Foreign Office representatives and to supply a further statement of the views of his Government on the southern sector of the proposed boundary. r r The meeting then proceeded to discuss the future of the Treaty of Jedda. inis part ot the discussion is recorded separately.
