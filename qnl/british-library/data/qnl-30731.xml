Flight Lieutenant Lickard has arrived iron ih.en from which place they are anxious to fly to India via Huecat. As you are aware I discussed the matter with his Highness before he left. .His Highness recommended their flying over the country Hast of Dhofar several times without landing. This they now propose to ao but they wish to make a landing ground near Has el Hadd to which they could fly direct from Dhofar without landing. '.'/ould you give your permission for Flight Lieut: Rickard to go by dhow to Rat el Hadd and lay out a ground there for this purpose? perhaps someone from the State coulu accompany him.

Sir I hare the honour to forward,herewith,a letter from certain petty Sheikhs of Rae K 1 Kadd with reference to the recent construct* -ion of a landing ground by Flight Lieut.Rickards at has hi Hadd. The landing ground there was not constructed until the per -Mission of the leading local sheikhs had been obtrined.lt was cons- -tructed with the assistance of local labour. The ejgnatcries to the letter are petty kheikhs who,in the opinion of the Council, hare doubtless been instigated by the sheikhs of the bani Bu All to write this letter. 3* The sheikhs of the &amp;&amp;t\iJh%ieT live at Khor oereiaa. The others lire at Has 131 hadd. They have no more than 100 followers each and are all euborc..lnc.te to halim biiv^sxer and Hamud bin Humaid of; the Bunt Bu iiassan who are loyal to the local Covernraent. The leading wheikh of Has ml Hadd,bald bin bi iem al Maliki, x pame to Muscat on the 2£nd May and informed the local Government about these intrigues. He was instructed by oaiyid baid to go back td Hub SI Hadd and warn these Bheikhs not to interfere with Govern* -fcent affairs which are no concern of theirs. 5* Opposition on the part of the Bani Bu All to the activities o#\the Royal Air Force was to be expected.

To The Hobble the political Resident in the Persian Gulf, JBushire. fopyt ' C FI g —trO y^ohi. rtr) SUBJECT*- Aden - Ras al Hadd Air Route. Memorandum. / I submit herewith a precis of the development of the Aden-Ras al Hadd Air Route up to date - as far as it is recorded in the files of this Agency. 2. The route covers two political areas? Aden-Dhofar (exclusive) under rolitical charge of Resident, Aden; Dhofar (inclusive) to Muscat under the Political Resident, Bushire. 3. The scheme was initiated by a D.O. letter ho.C.247 ColontL of the 5th April 1929, from ^sft€b^er Reilly, First Assistant Resident, Aden, to Major murphy, political Agent, Muscat, which can be summarised as follows! (a) The Air Ministry wished to establish a chain of landing grounds from Aden to Ras al Hadd in order to bring these two places into connection by air. (b) The Air ministry stated 'that there must be no suggestion of bringing in the civil authorities to set up administrations in outlying districts, nor are any arrangements with tribal chiefs envisaged* 4 • (c) The Resident, Aden, would lilee Major murphy’s advice on the project from the political point of view* Pa*e 3 Y-' 4. In his D.O. ho.53 C of the 23th April 1929, major Murphy replied to the effect!-t 2 ^7 Cki (a) That the Sultan would welcojae rmklng of a landing ground at Dhofar. (b) That the reconnaissance between Dhofar and Sur would be very difficult as the territory was wild and uncontrolled. Pafie 6 Pa£e 7A Pa&amp;e 11 21B Pa*e 15 W (c) That affairs in the Jaalan area itself were disturbed. ^ 5. A D.O. letter from Colonel Barrett, Acting political Hesident, ho,1793 of the 29th may, to Major Murphy enclosing an extract from a D.O. from Air Commodore Burnett No. 310451 VyJl of the 27th &amp;ay, stated that a flight from Muscat to Aden by flying boats was proposed in October, and asked what was the best harbours for refueling from Muscat to Dhofar. 6. A D.O# from Mr. Thomas to .*ajor Murphy of 20th June, forwarded under latter^ D.O.No.T.39 of the 25th June to Colonel Barrett, enumerated the more suitable harbours. 7. Colonel Keilly*s D.O. No.C.445 of the 20th June to Major Murphy, enclosing copies of various letters between various authorities on the subject of the air route, copies of which - Colonel Heilly stated - had been sent direct to Colonel Barrett, gave details of how a reconnaissance party would proceed from Aden to Dhofar in September for the purpose of making the landing ground there, and dumping petrol for the use of flying boats (see para 5 above). 8. further D.O. correspondence, major Murphy being in recess at Karachi, passed direct between Colonel Barrett and Mr. Thomas (No.250s of 5th July and No.719 of the 28th July), regarding petrol supply for the flight. Pate 41 9, In his telegram No.900 of the 11th September, Resident Bushire, asked the Political Agent, Muscat, if the *Al Saeed* would be available to proceed to Masira Island and Murbat for dumping petrol, to which the Political Agent, Muscat, Pale 41 replied in the affirmative in his No.980 of the i2th September. 10 In his telegram No. 907 of the 12th September, Resident3. .5e 44 Pafce 47 Pace 48 lOe 50 Pace 54 Pace 55 i5Ut.li.ire, iniormed the Political Agent, muscat, that the Air Ministry did not approve of the flight to Aden at present. U. Notwithstanding that the flight did not take place 1 have annotated the correspondence concerning it in some detail as the project will almost certainly be raised again, in which case reference to the correspondence should prove very useful. 12. The question of the Aden-Ras al hadd air route was a &amp;ain iaised in D.O. No.C«114 of the 15th February 1930 from Col. Reilly to *ajor uurphy, in which it was stated that the Air Officer Commanding, Aden, proposed -if possible- to establish landing grounds and sea plane bases between Dhofar and sur within the next 2 months. This communica— tion was forwarded to the Political Resident, Bushire, by Major Murphy in his D.O. ho.26 C of the 26th February, with the opinion that **the question should be approached by the Resident of Aden through you'. The Political Resident replied in his telegram No.263 of the 17th March according permission to -^ajor Murphy to take the necessary action. 13. in his D.O. reply No.37 C of the 21st Maroh to Col. Reilly , Major Murphy was of the opinion that the proposal 'was a tough proposition', and enclosed a letter from Mr. Thomas who was of the same opinion, as was the Sultan, the difficulty being that - as Mr.Thomas put it 'Eastwards of Nadhbaram almost to Has al hadd is perhaps the most barbarous coast of Arabia and here the Sultan himself cannot land' 14. telegram irom Resident, Aden, to the irolitical Agent, Muscat, No.369 of the 21st March announced that Plight Lieut. R ickards was arriving at Marbat by oil-tanker, and would proceed by dhow to Sur and Muscat, to v/hich the political Agent replied in his telegram No.39 C of the 22nd March adtising that Rickards should not land from the dhow between Marbat and Sur as if he did'he would almost certainly be shot up'.Page 56 4 • ^ *' 15# ^sident, Aden, replied in his Wo.370 of the 24th i*arcn that Hickards had been instructed not to proceed Page 56 beyond iiurbat and stated that -it is proposed that flight Page 57 should start from Aden on 23th &lt;*arch and land at Salalah where Hiokards would meet them'. Page 58 16. in his D.O. of the 11th April to major laurphy, Colonel .-tenly mentioned that a flight from Aden had visited Calalah while Hickards was there, and had returned to Aden, Kickards himself was proceeding by dhow to Muscat. Pufie 70 17. prom Muscat (where he arrived in due course) Flight Lieut. Kickards proceeded to Has al Hadd where he con structed a landing ground, vide letter No.67 C of the 24th may 1930 /S/i* from the political Agent, Muscat, to the Political Kesident, Bushire. 13. Resident, Aden, in his telegram Wo.377 of the 23rd April to the rolitical Kesident, Busnire, (repeated to tne political Agent, i&amp;uscat), asAed permission for to visit ~asirah Island v*ith a British political officer on board to inspect the possibilities for J - andln e by sea planes etc. The political Agent, Muscat, in his telegram Ko.60 C of the 24th April to the political Agent, muscat), the political Kesident, -wushire, agreed to the visit. 13. I enclose herewith copy of a D.O.letter No.C.328 of the 7th June 1930 addressed to me by Mr. Champion, protectorate W t C(x (a) copy of letter No.C.327 from the Resident and ^Ojuaander-in-Chief, Aden, to the Political Agent,Muscat, (b) copy of notes on journey of H.M.S.I.'Lawrance' to Masirah Island by Ool. Lake (o) copy of report of visits to Masirah, Kerbat, etc. etc., in H.I.M.S.'Lawrence'.5 &amp; 20* I ha/e not replied to Mr* Champion’s letter because I have not had sufficient time to study the question t and also because I considered it advisable to express my views officially to you first, which I will do later. As Major Murphy will be calling at Aden on his way homo Mr. Champion will be able to get the latter’s views personally. SUMMARY 21.

(b) The air control from Aden to uas al Hadd is apparently under Air Officer Commanding* Aden* vide Mr. Champion’s D.O* letter Ho.C.328 of the 7th dune, while presumably air control up to SUR remains under Air Headquarters* Baghdad.
