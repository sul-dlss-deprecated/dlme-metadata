The changes to Cox's position suggested by the Secretary of State ultimately did not occur as they were said to give too much attention to the civil administration of Baghdad rather than focusing on immediate military concerns.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force, Chief Political Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Frederick Stanley Maude</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Occupational status</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00029a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
