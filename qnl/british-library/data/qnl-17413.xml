The translation of a letter (folios 16-19) from Muhammad bin Ali, to the Honourable Mountstuart Elphinstone, Governor of Bombay, dated 1 February 1825. Muhammad bin Ali states that, since his interview with the Resident [Stannus], the Imam of Muscat and other individuals have been intriguing against him, and that he no longer feels safe.2. Draft of a letter (folios 20-21) from the Honourable Mountstuart Elphinstone, Governor of Bombay, to Mahomed bin Ali, dated 23 February 1825.
