Many thanks for your letter of 13th September, ' 6278/25/10, about the supply of arms to the iungans. ihe draft telcraai sent off on 10th Septer.ber on receipt of 'oreigp Office concurrence by telephone. As regards your Legal Adviser's minute, I think there may be some misunderstanding resulting from the word 'neutrality' in our telegram. Ue did not use the word in the sense that belongs to it m international law. and were not thinking of the Sino-Japanese conflict but of the local struggles between the oarties m Southern Sinkiang. In these our policy is neutral in the sense of not taking sides with either party (I think the Government of India will understand that this is what we meant), but on the other hand we want, as far as nossible, not to alienate the Tungans. Hence the suggestion that we might offer facilities for the transmission of their -essfige to Hanking. It will be an end of the matter if the Nanking Government decline to , ive a nemit - as they probably will, because they do not recognise the iungans. i!.B. Ronald, Esq., C.M.G., C.v.u (Sgd.) J.C.

PZ. 5325/37 and PZ. 5842/37 of the 7th and 9th September about the supply of arms to the TungansJ we concur in the draft telegram to the Government of India which was enclosed in the latter. The attached minute on the legal aspect of the matter may be of interest to you. Walton, Esq., C.B., M.Ccorn* (P 6278/25/10) At present, of course, there is no professed state of war, and so no question of neutrality arises and there is no reason why the arms should not he supplied. But a state of war may at any time supervene and before the arms, or all of them, have been delivered. Although neutrality does not forbid private persons and arms manufacturers in neutral territory from supplying belligerents it does forbid neutral governments, as governments, from effecting such a supply. In the present case it appears that the arms are owned by the Government of India and would be supplied by them. Consequently, it would appear that there would be a breach of neutrality. I suggest that in the present case the Government of India should nevertheless supply the arms by making use of the following argument, that Sinkiang, though technically Chinese territory and under Chinese sovereignty, is under a semi-independent administration only in very loose relationship with the Nanking Government; that there is every reason to believe that the arms are needed by the local authorities for their own local purposes and not for the prosecution of any hostilities against Japan; in fact, that the supply will not be a supply to China .qua belligerent This may not be a terribly good argument from the purely theoretical point of view, but in practice I think it would cover the case. I think it well to draw attention to these matters, because I am not convinced we can accept the India Office*s optimistic surmise that their suggested reply will prove to amount to a polite refusal.

'N The Tungans* who are now in control at Kashgar, have made an enquiry at the British Consulate regarding the possibility of obtaining munitions from India. The enquiry was informal and no special arms were mentioned. Major Paclorian informed them that he anticipated no difficulty if they obtained the permission of the Nanking Government. On being pressed he promised to refer the matter for orders. Our policy in Sinkiang during the disturbances of recent years has been consistently to refuse to supply arms without the authorisation of the Central Government. Major Packman considers that the Tungans v/ill appreciate the reasons for our refusal. At the same time, we may sympathise with the remark of the Tung an Officer that communication with Nanking is slow and difficult. The mere repetition of the same formula might seem to the Tungans lacking in friendliness. Their goodwill towards us has been, and is likely to be, an asset of the greatest value - especially if their present successes lead on to the capture of Urumchi, the provincial capital. It is particularly undesirable that, in despair of obtaining arms from India, they should feel compelled to compromise their independence in return for Russian (or Japanese) help in the supply of munitions. Fortunately there is no sign at present of any such intention. The Tungans are hostile to Soviet penetration; and will be careful, in view of their strong profession of loyalty to Nanking, to avoid flirtation with Japan as long, at least, as the Sino-Japanese hostilities continue. But they are . known to be short of ammunition and unless they succeed in 5853 5000 3 372 . capturing supplies from the Provincial Government their requests to us are likely to be renewed with greater urgency. It is suggested, therefore, that,while repeating our refusal to supply munitions without authorisation from Nanking, we might offer to forward in our Consular mail bag any letter or telegram they wish to address to the Central Government. It should be made quite plain that we could not undertake to make any representation to Nanking on their behalf. Our offer would consist of postal facilities only. The exact form of the offer might be left to the Consul-General*s discretion, but its object would be to convince the Tungans of our friendly and impartial attitude. In the last paragraph of the Kashgar telegram the question has been raised whether the Barcelona Convention of 1921 would apply to transit of arms through India consigned to Sinkiang from abroad. The point is unlikely to arise as the Central Government ha-ve not ratified the Convention and, therefore^ claim to benefit from it (see Article 6). The last sentence of Article 6 which seems to provide an exception in the case of goods in transit under the flag of a contracting state to a non-contracting state is by no means clearj but any claims made under it could be considered on their merits. A draft telegram to the Government of India is submitted^ ^ Military Secretary, E. &amp; 0. Secretary, We have been expecting the comments of the Government of India on the request,of the Tungan authorities for munitions but as they have sent nothing perhaps we should suggest to them the reply which might be given to this request. I have slightly modified the draft. £ .3. © Minute Paper. Department. •A V * - - ^ 3Vv3^ i . .v &lt;&gt;. 5971 9 s—^ / 5853 5000 3 37 I would be grateful if the E.&amp; 0. Secretary would say whether he concurs in paragraph 2 of the draft. My reading of the last sentence of Article 6 of the Barcelona Convention is that it applies only to ships of a contracting state transiting another contracting state to a non-contracting state by a water-way, and that, consequently, the Convention has no bearing on the transit of goods -to Sinkiang so long as China is not a contracting party. In any case, I do not see how the Convention would oblige the Government of India to allow the transit of munitions to Sinkiang contrary to the wishes of the Nanking Government. But the Barcelona Convention point seems entirely academic and it is suggested that we should not enter into a long explanation to the Government of India. u .suvv—' \ ^ , ^ l ^ * U&lt;x 2 ^ M &lt;iW!G ^ ‘~ SL l'£ ^ ONI uyvfjUuJ»M^ , ^ U?X ' # cx.6030 Wt 9128—P 18 10,000 4.37 IOP P.Z. 5325/37 Draft Paper.

The effect of the suggested reply to the Tungans (with whom we wish to keep on good terms because they control the area in which British interests are centred) seems likely to be the same as a polite refusal - unless, of course, they succeed in obtaining control of the whole province and are then recognised by the Nanking Govt.^which they^ on their side, I believe, have always been ready to recognise). r our a (SdO J. 0.

In order to comply with the provisions of Article 18 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Secretary-General will register the present Convention upon the deposit of the first ratification. Article 5. Members of the League of Nations which have not signed the present Convention before the 1st December, 1921, may accede to it.

Persons, baggage and goods, and also vessels, coaching and goods stock, and other means of transport, shall be deemed to be in transit across territory under the sovereignty or authority of one of the Contracting States, when the passage across such territory, with or without transhipment, warehousing, breaking bulk, or change in the mode of transport, is only a portion of a complete journey, beginning and terminating beyond the frontier of the State across whose territory the transit takes place. Traffic of this nature is termed in this Statute ‘ ‘ traffic in transit.” Article ‘2. — Subject to the other provisions of this Statute, the measures taken by Contracting States for regulating and forwarding traffic across territory under their sovereignty or authority shall facilitate free transit by rail or waterway on routes in use convenient forM 15 international transit. No distinction shall be made which is based on the nationality of persons, the hag of vessels, the place of origin, departure, entry, exit or destination, or on any circumstances relating to the ownership of goods or of vessels, coaching or goods stock or other means of transport. In order to ensure the application of the provisions of this Article, Contracting States will allow transit in accordance with the customary conditions and reserves across their territorial waters. Article 3. Traffic in transit shall not be subject to any special dues in respect of transit (including entry and exit). Nevertheless, on such traffic in transit there may be levied dues intended solely to defray expenses of supervision and administration entailed by such transit. The rate of any such dues must correspond as nearly as possible with the expenses which they are intended to cover, and the dues must be imposed under the conditions of equality laid down in the preceding Article, except that on certain routes, such dues may be reduced or even abolished on account of differences in the cost of supervision. Article 4. The Contracting States undertake to apply to traffic in transit on routes operated or administered by the State or under concession, whatever may be the place of departure or destination of the traffic, tariffs which’, having regard to the conditions of the traffic and to considerations of commercial competition between routes, are reasonable as regards both their rates and the method of their application. These tariffs shall be so fixed as to facilitate inter national traffic as much as possible. No charges, facilities or restrictions shall depend, directly or indirectly, on the nationality or ownership of the vessel or other means of transport on which an\ part of the complete journey has been or is to be accomplished. Article 5. No Contracting State shall be bound by this Statute to afford transit for passengers whose admission into its territories is forbidden, or for goods of a kind of which the importation is prohibited, either on grounds of public health or security, or as a precaution against -diseases of animals or plants. Each Contracting State shall be entitled to take reasonable precautions to ensure that persons, baggage and goods, particularly goods which are the subject of a monopoly, and also vessels, coaching and goods stock and other means of transport, are really in transit, as well as to ensure that passengers in transit are in aposition to complete their journey, and to prevent the safety of the routes and means of communication being endangered. Nothing in this Statute shall affect the measures which one of the Contracting States may feel called upon to take in pursuance of general international Conventions to which it is a party, or which may be concluded hereafter, particularly Conventions concluded under the auspices of the League of Nations, relating to the transit, export or import of particular kinds of articles, such as opium or other dangerous drugs, arms or the produce of fisheries, or in pursuance of general Conventions intended to prevent any infringement of industrial, literary or artistic property, or relating to false marks, false indications of origin, or other methods of unfair competition. Any haulage service established as a monopoly on waterways used for transit must be so organised as not to hinder the transit of vessels. Article 6. This Statute does not of itself impose on any of the Contracting States a fresh obligation to grant freedom of transit to the nationals and their baggage, or to the flag of a non-Contracting State, nor to the goods, nor to coaching and goods stock or other means of transport coming or entering from, or leaving by, or destined for .a non-Contracting State, except when a valid reason is shown for such transit by one of the other Contracting States concerned. It is understood that for the purposes of this Article, goods in transit under the flag of a Contracting State shall, if no transhipment takes place, benefit by the advantages granted to that flag. Article 7. The measures of a general or particular character which a Contracting State is obliged to take in case of an emergency affecting the safety of the State or the vital interests of the country may in exceptional cases, and for as short a period as possible, involve a deviation from the provisions of the above Articles; it being understood that the principle of freedom of transit must be observed to the utmost possible extent. Article 8. This Statute does not prescribe the rights and duties of belligerents and neutrals in time of war. The Statute shall, however, continue in force in time of war so far as such rights and duties permit.19 Article 9. This Statute does not impose upon a Contracting State any obligations conflicting with its rights and duties as a Member of the League of Nations. Article 10. The coming into force of this Statute will not abrogate treaties, conventions and agreements on questions of transit concluded by Contracting States before the 1st May 1921. In consideration of such agreements being kept in force, Contracting States undertake, either on the termination of the agreement or when circumstances permit, to introduce into agreements so kept in force which contravene the provisions of this Statute the modifications required to bring them into harmony with such provisions, so far as the geographical, economic or technical circumstances of the countries or areas concerned allow. Contracting States also undertake not to conclude in future treaties, conventions or agreements which are inconsistent with the provisions of this Statute, except when geographical, economic or technical considerations justify exceptional deviations therefrom. Furthermore, Contracting States may, in matters of transit, enter into regional understandings consistent with the principles of this Statute. ♦ Article 11. This Statute does not entail in any way the withdrawal of facilities which are greater than those provided for in the Statute and have been granted, under conditions consistent with its prin ciples, to traffic in transit across territory under the sovereignty or authority of a Contracting State. The Statute also entails no prohibitions of such grant of greater facilities in the future. Article 12. In conformity with Article 28 (e) of the Covenant of the League of Nations, any Contracting State which can establish a good case against the application of any provision of this Statute in some or all of its territory on the ground of the grave economic situation arising out of the acts of devastation perpetrated on its soil during the war 1914-1918, shall be deemed to be relieved temporarily of the obligations arising from the application of such provision, it being understood that the principle of freedom of transit must be observed to the utmost possible extent.mm 21 Aeticle IB. Any dispute which may arise as to the interpretation or appli cation of this Statute which is not settled directly between the parties themselves shall be brought before the Permanent Court of International Justice, unless, under a special agreement or a general arbitration provision, steps are taken for the settlement of the dispute by arbitration or some other means. Proceedings are opened in the manner laid down in Article 40 of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice In order to settle such disputes, however, in a friendly way as far as possible, the Contracting States undertake, before resorting to any judicial proceedings and without prejudice to the powers and right of action of the Council and of the Assembly, to submit such disputes for an opinion to any body established by the League of Nations, as the advisory and technical organisation of the Members of the League in matters of communications and transit. In urgent cases, a preliminary opinion may recommend temporary measures intended, in particular, to restore the facilities for freedom of transit which existed before the act or occurrence which gave rise to the dispute. Article 14. In view of the fact that within or immediately adjacent to the territory of some of the Contracting States there are areas or enclaves, small in extent and population in comparison with such territories, and that these areas or enclaves form detached portions or settlements of other parent States, and that it is impracticable for reasons of an administrative order to apply to them the provisions of this Statute, it is agreed that these provisions shall not apply to them. The same stipulation applies where a colony or dependency has a very long frontier in comparison with its surface and where in consequence it is practically impossible to afford the necessary Customs and police supervision. The States concerned, however, will apply in the cases referred to above a regime which will respect the principles of the present Statute and facilitate transit and communications as far as practicable. Article 15. It is understood that this Statute must not be interpreted as regulating in any way rights and obligations inter se of territories forming part or placed under the protection of the same sovereign State, whether or not these territories are individually Members of the League of Nations.Note.

E.P. Donaldson, Esq., India Office, miitehQ.ll, S.W.l. lly dear Donaldson, When I was coming out of the Chinese Legation in Berlin last Wednesday afternoon I saw three or four Chinamen who did not look as if they belonged and I asked who they were. I was informed by the Commercial Councillor of the Legation that they were the son of the 'Chairman' of the proTincial Government of Sinkiang and some other important members of the late Government. (?) The son has apparently received instructions from the 'Chairman' to remain in Berlin to continue his studies, although the 'Chairman' is now making the best of his way to Shanghai via Vladivostok. I had a talk to one called Buch Hann (Hann I believe means Mr.) who told me that the revolt was entirely the fault of the 'Chairman' who is a self-seeker and cares nothing for his country. He said that a new government is shortly to be established which he hopes will be better. Buch Hann himself was on the point of leaving for Urumtsi via Moscow by air, Novosivirsk by car and Semipalatinsk on horses, but has not yet obtained his Soviet visa. He tells me that he thinks it unlikely that our quotations ever reached Urumtsi. I of course placed myself entirely at his disposal for any armament enquiries he might wisfo/wish to make, hut he was naturally more interested in his rather romantic journey than anything I had to say. I thought the above might interest you. The Chinese Councillor who was lunching with me told me that although Buch Hann was a Tartar he spoke to him in 'high Chinese' from which I suppose he meant literal Chinese, but that he bad a slight accent. To me he spoke in rather indifferent German. Yours sincerely. (3D.) CHARIES BRIDGS*No.24-C., dated, the 29th March 1933, and enc losure. No. F.367-X/32.

Mr. Pan Tsi-Lu is an adviser to the Chairman of the Sinkiang Provincial Government, who is now interesting himself keenly in the re-equipment of the local forces on modern lines.

N.J.Fitzmaurice, Esq., H.B.M.Consul General, British Consulate-General, KASHGAR, Via Gilgit, INDIA. Sir, TOmrawr - CHINESE TURKESTAN . We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th November last enclosing a letter addressed to yourself by Mr. Pan Tsi-Lu, a Chinese official, adviser to the Chairman of the Sinkiang Provincial Government, who we understand from your is interesting himself keenly in the re-equipment of the local forces on modern lines. Ie have had further information in connection with this prospective business from the Department of Overseas Trade and from the India Office, and are forwaraing this communication to you through the lauter. We gather that the present enquiry includes the following items:- (a) 20-2 cm. Cerlikon or Sol othurn Machine Guns with 10,000 shells, accessories and suams. (b) 5 Carden-Loyd Light Amoured Vehicles with Guns, Accessories &amp;nd Ammunition. (c) 2,000 Pedersen Self-Loading Rifles and 2,000,000 rounds of Ammunition. (d) 1,000 Pistols of Mauser type with 1,000 rounds of Ammunition each. With regard to these prospective requirements, we beg to remarks as follows:- (a)/(a) 20 ' 2cm, Cerlikon or Solothurn Machine Guns with 10.000 shelis, accessories and' 'stand's.'' We do not recommend ti^ purchase of either of the above weapons, for the purpose for which they are required. These heavy calibre machine guns are specially intended for Anti-Tank and Anti-Aircraft use. They fire Armour Piercing Bullets, intended for the destruction of Tanks protected by heavy bullet proof armour, or explosive bullets for use against aircraft. They are thus unsuitable for maintaining internal order and are heavier and more expensive then more suitable weapons of our manufacture. Thev do not fire 'Shell”, in the true sense of the word. (b) 5 Carden-Loyd Li^nt Armoured Vehicles with Guns . Accessories arid 'iiiiinuriiTidn.' We can with confidence recommend the Carden-Loyd Light Armoured Vehicles for the maintenance of internal order, for which purpose they are particularly suitable, being equipped with a Rifle Calibre Machine Gun. The physical difficulties in delivering these over the Karakorum will complicate the question of their supply, but we are sure that if the Government decides to purchase, they can be so made as to be divisible into loads of 80 lbs, though itwould of course be necessary to replace the rivets in the present design by bolts, and to make certain minor modifications which would entail some extra expense. It would also be necessary for a mechanic to accompany the vehicles to re-assemble them on arrival. If other armament is required to be carried in a vehicle towed behind the Carden-Loyd, we suggest the latest pattern Vickers-Armstrongs Infantry Equipment arrange for mule or man pack, which is provided with two barrels of different calibre - one of 25.4 m/m. diameter to fire a high velocity anti-tank projectile and the other of 70 m/m. calibre for firing a high explosive shell for the destruction of/of buildings and other defences. If the high velocity anti-tank service is not required, the 25*4 Hi/ni Darrel could be omitted* Arrangements could be made for this equipment to be carried on a wheeled trailer towed by the Carden-Loyd light armoured vehiclej but as the result of trials we do not now recommend a tracked trailer. (c) 2.000 Pederson Self-Loading Rifles and 2&gt;000.,000 rounds o f' Mxnuni tionV While we could, of course, quote for these weapons of which we are, outside America, the sole manuisnturers, we would suggest that the requirements of the Governor of Sinkiang could best be met by expending the money avail able for the 20 heavy Machine Guns under (a) and these 2,000 Pedersen Self-Loading Rifles on (say) 4,000 Vickers-Berthier Machine Rifles. These weapons are particularly sinqJe in construction, easy in operation and cheap to maintain, and are much more suitable for use in a country not equipped with Armament Factories than the more complicated Pedersen Rifle, which, if itg&gt;es out of order, miuires a skilled workman to repair it. These Vickers-Berthier Rifles can be fired from the shoulder, but normal use is from a light bipod or irom a tripod. When fired from the latter they are equal to any Rifle Calibre Machine Gun and can also be used most effectively for Anti-Aircraft fire up to a vertical range of 1,000 metres. By the purchase of the Vickers-Berthier Rifles, the Governor of Sinkiang will have at his disposal weapons firing at the rate of 500 r.p.m., which are very little heavier than the Pedersen Rifle and far more effective in the sustained volume of fire which they can produce. If necessary Armour Piercing Ammunition for these Rifles can be provided. 1 ne I are of the ordinary Rifle Calibre, so that the supply of ammunition/ammunition for them is much less expensive than in the case of the 20 m/m Machine Guns and more easily obtained then in the case of the Pedersen Self-Loading Rifle, for which one ammunition is of a special calibre and has to oe specially made, (d ) 1.Q0Q Pistols of M auser tvoe with l.QQQ rounds.,of Amrnun i t i o n ~ e'aclT T~ We shall be glad to submit quotations for these* We hope to be able shortly to forward you our formal proposals on the lines of the above, but would be glad to have as early as possible an indication, if it can be obtained, of the money which is definitely available for the purchases in question. We would desire that the definite contract waich would naturally be drawn up in the event of business resulting, should contain a provision to the effect that the whole of the money involved in the purchases wouldbe deposited as an irrevocable credit in a London Bank approved by us, and that a substantial proportion should be released to us on signature of the contract and the balance against acceptance at our Works in England* With regard to delivery from our Works to destination, we suggest this should be carried out by us on the basis of actual cost and that the suggested irrevocable credit should include an amount to cover that cost. The proposals we shall submit will of course be subject to the necessary licences from the British Government being available when the contract is signed and on the understanding that inspection of the material and acceptance would be finally carried out at our Works in England.

Dear Donaldson, With further reference to your letter P.Z*7852/32 of January 3rd relative to arms for the Sinkiang provincial Government ? I write to say that Colonel Bridge of Vickers has sent me a copy of his official letter to the India Office C*26958/0.W. of January 31st together with the enclosures thereto. 2. I observe from the enclosures that on the 26th November Fitzmaurice wrote direct to yickers-Armstrong forwarding to them a letter from Mr. Pan Tsi-Lu. in the present instance it does not very much matter except that we had approached vickers-A^mstrong when we heard from you on a matter with which they were already acquainted by direct correspondence from the Consul General. There is, however, / E.P.Donaldson Esqmmmmm 2 however, a standing instruction in the general instructions to consular Officers that letters to business firms ought always to pass through the Department of Overseas Trade. This rule has been found very necessary in practice 9 with a view to protecting consulates abroad from getting into communication either with undesirable firms or with firms who are not selling British goods. In the present instance it might have been the case that the War office had some views about this particular arms transaction, and though all has ended v/ell perhaps you might feel like dropping a very gentle hint to pitzmaurice that it is better that all such letters to private firms should be sent through some Government Department in Whitehall. 3. Of course it is always possible that pitzmaurice f s letter of the 26th November passed through the India Office, in which case there would be no need for any action to be taken. yours sincerely,aHMann DRAFT TELEGRAM.

There are two snags. The first is that Vickers stuff is too good, and too dear, delivery and payments will mean endless wrangles, and the firm are used to dealing with more or less respectable governments, and not with a semi-barbaric one, which pays its bills by printing paper in the ba%ar‘. Vickers a,re quite business-like, and all that; but as 1 say, not a practical proposition for marshal len. January 26th. 1933. The second snag is that the Governor will turn to a the Germans, and they will deliver the goods, either by purchase in Russia, or by import. This has happened in the case of tutors, machin ery, salvarsan abd such like diverse requirements of the Urumchi ruler. 1 do not expect the Government of India to present arms to the neighbours of binkiang. I have always rather deplored the lack of vision shown by Simla. There are lots of arms in India, of good enough -rr f or v very doubtful value to the government,~ but quite the .nrnies of . These might be well given to’ oinici- ang, providing the carriage would be defrayed by the donees. ^his gift would prove a useful counter for bargaining with the Governor, and wresting Indian morchants and a more favourable attitude towards our. settlers. ^ ^ C* ./e really have been rather like the bunnia in the bazar.

S. 0 •, Chasewood Lodge, Thank you for your letter of Boss, the 23rd January, in wlr'ch you again refer to the question of the supply of machine guns, rifles, etc., to Herefordshire. the Government of Sinkiang. As Walton told you in his letter of the 22nd November,P.Z.6518/32, we telegraphed to India, asking them to ascertain, so far as possible, through Fitzmaurice, whether an official request or inquiry was to be expected from the Chairman, and we had a reply on the 9th December to the effect that they had wired to Fitzmaurice and would let us know the reply when received from him. At the end of December, however, we received copy of a letter, dated 10th November, from Kashgar, indicating that the Provincial Government had asked for particulars and prices of . the articles mentioned in your previous letter, giving somewhat more precise details. The inquiries appeared, however, to be principally for articles of foreign manufacture, though it might be possible to suggest satisfactory substitutes of British manufacture. These details have been com unicated to Kickers Armstrongs through/ Nr. Wa.lton 10(&gt;3 4000 7.32r t x through the D.O.T., and we expect to hear shortly whether Vickers are prepared to send out quotations. Fitzmaurice reported that he had suggested some time ago that the Provincial Oov err rent could not do better than open direct negotiations with Vickers Armstrongs, but he added that 'it would probably be impossible for them to do so unless Mr. Pan Tsi-Lu were to remain in Urumchi'. Watts told us when he called that he thought it was most desirable to send out quotations for this material through the Consul-General even though it was doubtful whether business would actually result, and we have every! intention, if Vickers Armstrongs produce their quotations, of sending them out as soon as possible. It is only fair to say, however, that the Voverr ent of India have no intention of presenting these arms to the Sinkiang Government and that Vickers Armstrongs would isfactorily [ nk that there ,11 fficulty, -^ fhn~gh * IDraft Paper.

With regard to the Carden Loyd light armoured tanks, supply will be subject to the condition that these tanks are the Vickers Carden Loyd patrol tanks such as have already been supplied to Denmark, Poland *&amp;c, or Carden Loyd M/G carriers which are not on the secret list. If you consider it worth while to ask any/British firms to tender for any of the war material other than the tanks, I suggest that 1.0,1. might be interested in supplying the ammunition.

I have only just returned to Ross, and consequently I have not been able to reply to your letter of the 22nd November, for which 1 thank you, and for the delay in an swering you, I beg to offer you my apologies. I think that it is, as you say, quite useless to introduce the Government of Sinkiang to Messrs Vickers or to any firm. The Chinese would recoil, and it is not that sort of action, but a more personal and political one, that they are now searching for. The financial arrangements which the Government of India have previously adopted are rightly regarded by you as de sirable to th Chinese aethod of business, if so it can be called. I hope that the Government of India realise that it is some advantage, though not perhaps a very great one, to have these relations between ourselves and the Sinkiang author- ties; relations, too, capable of being developed and ex ploited by those on the spot, to the interest of British subjects and their affairs in the province of dinkiang, I have never however pretended that Fitzmaurise is the manmmmmami to take that persistent, tedious, 'but most necessary action which can alone oring any fruit from these negaciations.

We do not in the least regard your interest in the matter as officious interference, but on the contrary appreciate your willingness to help.

It would, of course, be possible to put Mr. Pan Tsi-lu into direct touch with the armament firms, such as Vickers, and ask them to send** out quotations to him for the supply of the weapons andjnaterial which the Governor desires, but our experience in the matter of the aeroplanes in the early part of this year was not very encouraging, and we have done, I think, all that is possible to put the Chairman in the way of negotiating his purchase. We are telegraphing to the Government of India asking them to ascertain so far as possible through Pitzmaurice whether an official request or enquiry is to be expected from the Chairman. As/ 100:* 4000 7.32As regards financial arrangements, it is always easier to arrange these matters where the transactions take place between governments, as the Government of India have up till now been willing to give fairly extended credit to the Sinkiang Government for the arms which they have supplied from stock, and this arrangement appeared to have suited the Chinese and to have worked out satisfactorily. In the case of dealings with a private firm, the usual terms required in a case of this sort are 'cash against documents', and with these, I gather, the Sinkiang Government find it difficult to conform.

Walton, who is on leave until next week, has asked me to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of the 24th October, regarding the request of r. Pan Tsi-la, the Agent of the Chain^an of Sinkiang, for the supply of rifles, machine guns, etc. I am sending out details of this request to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India by this week ? s air mail, and am suggesting that he should telegraph to the Consul-General at Kashgar, who may be in a position to know, or to ascertain, to wh it extent this should be regarded as a form'd statement of the Governor’s requirements. In the meantime, perhaps you will think it right to reply to hr. Pan-Tsi-lu to the effect that the Government of India will no doubt be prepared to consider the Chairman’s renuest for assistance, but that it would be more convenient to then if/ Lieut.-Colonel .C.7. Schomberg, D.S.G.if statements of His Excellency's requirements reached them through the regular official channels, since difficult questions arise of transport arrangements for large quantities of heavy and bulky articles, and export licences and other formalities are more easily negotiated by the use of the offici?il channels. This suggested reply is not meant, as I am sure you will realise, to be in the least discouraging, but simply to follow on the lines of Dalton’s letter to you of the 2nd July, which dealt with the machinery, munitions, etc., purchased by I r. Barchan m Berlin, and t-r. Pan’s request for quotations for the supply of trench mortars and tanks. As regards the Covemor’s idea of recruiting a British gold mining agent, we have heard nothing since Fitzmaurice reported in March of this year that the Chairman was still considering the matter, and would send word when he had made up his mind. Fitzmaurice’s impression was that the Chairman and his advisers would be unlikely to be willing to pay the expert’s salary unless the latter were rash enough to accept payment mIMBIa OFFICE, .vlHTEHALL, S.,. 1 Bth October, 1932 rayutione the Simi&amp;nf Govern ent Purchase of r ichinery, aeroplanes and Z A 1 — A.. , t'J «•»»!#-J f 4sr4 4' X Hji+/ Jutz*.

I feel considerably embarrassed, as you may recollect that in a previous letter 1 mentioned to you that these mat ters should more properly go through II.B.ITs Consul-general. Whitehall is not Urumchi, and without discussing the ques tion, it is quite clear that the Chinese have other prefer ences in getting things done. I am not astonished. I gather that the Governor is still thinking of getting a &gt; British gold-miner. Mr Pan is a good friend of ours, and a an opponent of the U.3.S.R. It would perhaps he prudent to meet him so fan as possible, in view of the jreat influence of Russia at Urumchi.If we do not meet the wishes of His Excellency, it is likely that our refusal would strengthen infl ences inimi cal to British and Indian .

You will remember discussing with me last march the question whether the machinery, aeroplanes and nunitions purchased in Germany and Switzerland oy hr• Burchan for the dinkiang Provincial Government could be transported to this country through India. I then agreed to enquire by telegraph whether there would be any objection in principle to the passage of such articles through India, but at the same time I made it clear that information would be required as to the sixe and weight of the packages and the approximate number of pack animals needed. I have not yet received these details from you, and the 'faoyin, from whom I again enquired recently, was unable to give me any further info rmation. You already know something of the difficulties of the Ladakh road, and I hope that, in the Chairman’s interests, you will impress them upon him. ** ponyload on that road cannot safely exceed 160 Ids, that is to say, two packages of SO lbs. each. If the gross weight of each package cannot be kept down to this figure, transport through India will be impossible. This point must be fully understood before the goods are despatched from Europe. If the goods are sent to India and are th en found to be unsuitable for pack transport, they will . have to be shipped away again and sent by another route. Apart from the disappointment and delay, this would- involve an enormous loss of money on freight and other charges, and it would be a great pity if the Chairmanv; ere to suffer such l. loss turough failure to oh tain details of the packages in good time. The possibility of flying any particular type of aeroplane from India to Sinkiang is a question of which I nave not the necessary expert 'knowledge to speak; but, on receipt of details of the machines, I shall be glad to communicate to the Government of India any enquiry wnich you may address to me on the sueject.

Regarding his suggestion that a linut be placed on the number of mif pony loads of goods to be carried in one season, in order that normal trade requirements might not be unduly affected! the object aimed at would probably be secured if arrangements for transport are .made (as wa« done last year in the case of the munitions for the Uoyernor of Sinkiang ) through a contractor who should not indent on the local coolies or pocies or take supplies of grain etc. from the local depots. It Is also desirable that provided the Kashmir flarbar agree (and there is no reason to suppose they would object), the Chinese Government should send an agent to Leh (as taey did in 1931) to arrange onward transport.

The stock of Mortars to which you refer are all old war-time equipment. Of these we hold about 200 4-inch, and a certain number of 5-inch mortars. The mortars themselves are in a repairable condition, but no ammunition fit for use exists. It would be necessary to make special ammunition for the Sinkiang Government, and this would be an expensive and lengthy undertaking. Captain Sherriff called here two days ago and we explaned the mortar situation very fully to him, A and told him what we would recommend the Sinkiang Government to do in order to get efficient mortars.

The Sinkiang Government have not yet, however, furnished details of the consignments, which may prove on examination to consist of packages too large and too heavy for pack transport. Without these particulars/particulars it is obviously out of the question to specify the precise facilities to be granted. As regards hr.

D*86,dated the 21st March, I referred to the purchase of mining machinery in Europe by the Chairman of the Sinkiajig Government. I understand that the machinery in question is intended for the gold mines in the Altai, and it is possible that you mav have beared soii»thing from Colonel Schomberg on the subject* 2. When he was in Urumchi, Schomberg discussed with the Chair* man the development of the gold resources of Sinkiang in general, and the employment of a British gold miner or gold expert in particular* My files contain nothing on the subject; but I believe that, at Schomberg^s suggestion. Watts enquired from Mr* Pan Tsi-Lu Aether the Chairman was still interested in obtaining the services of such a man. Pan Tsi-Lu referred the question by telegram to Urumchi, and the Chairman replied that he was considering the matter and would send word when he had made up fr gft his mind on the subject* 3. I have recently received from Schomberg a letter in which he mentioned the name of an available gold expert and suggested that I might discuss with the Provincial Government the question of his employment; but I do not feel that I can fittingly take up the matter unless I am aoproached by the Chinese Authorities, and this they have not yet shown any sign of doing* 4* ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S | Lettur No SB M. j Dated [ E MAY. 1932 Reoeivea 23 MAY. ,53?i at the Chairman and hi a 4 advisera would not ca’rei to pay an expert*s salary* unless the latter were rash enougii to accept it in Sinkiang notes.

In rejjly to my proposal, to •mtsmaurice that he might act in the matter, he declines to do anything unless it is brought officially to his no tice.

Dear v/ylie. In the letter from the Commercial Counsellor at Berlin {Do.53/33/31.

Burchan, a representative of the Binkiang Provincial Government. 2. Mr* Bure hen is reported as having said that ’’one of the chief conerns of his Governinent was the arrangement of transport facilities via India so as to avoid the necessity of crossing Russian territory”, and he was advised to discuss the matter with the India Office before returning to Sinkiang. I do not know whether he took any steps in this connection. 3. On March 18th however Mr. Pan Tsi-Lu, who acted lor the Chairman of tne Provincial Government in Urumchi in connection with the supply of arms a,nd ammunition, called oil^ me on behalf of the Taoyin who is temporarily absent from Kashgar. It transpired that the Chairman had telegraphed, instructions to the Taoyin to enquire from me whe fner his recent purcha.ses in Burope cou_d be transported to Sinkiang via India, The Chairman had apparently counted on ^importing them via Russia, but this plan had fallen enclosure/ IN 4-u !

Incidentally Mr. Pan Tsi-Lu himself would probably like to be entrusted with this mission. 5. I pointed out to Mr, Pan Tsi-Lu that the first essential was to ascertain the size and weight of the packages, and reminded him of his recent experience of the limitations of pack transport on the Leh route. If the packages were neither too large nor too heavy, and if he would give me an approximate idea of the number of ponies required, I would submit the proposition tc the Government of India. I mentioned, however, that, presuming that there was no objection to the passage of the goods through India, it would probably be necessary on this occasion for the Chinese authorities to make the necessary transport arrangements, either through an agent in India or a carrier. 6. If the packages are suitable for pack transport, and if you see no objections on other grounds, I would suggest that a limit might be placed on the number of pony loads of such goods to be carried in one season, in order that normal trade requirements might not be unduly affected. I should also endeavour to obtain satisfactory assurances that, after arrival of the goods in hinkiang, theConfidential D. 0.

Bear Wylie On his return to Kashgar, the xaoyin lost no time in calling to discuss the question of the transport through India of the Chairman 1 s recent European purchases, mentioned in my demi-official letter ho. I). 86 dated the 21st instant. I understand that the Chairman is much concerned, since the Russian route is closed to him, as to how he is to secure possession of the articles at all. 2. I pointed out to the Xaoyin that something more than the meagre description 1 had yet received was called for before I could submit the proposition officially to the Government of India. Ma Taoyin explained however that it would probably take much time and trouble to ascertain whether the Chairmans purchases could be suitably packed for pony transport, and that the labour and cost of telegraphing would be wasted if the Government of India then refused permission for the munitions, etc. to pass through India. 3. At his urgent request I therefore telegraphed (vide my telegram ho. 17-C dated the 26th March) enquiring whether the Government of India would have any objection in vyypec principle to the passage of such articles through the country. 4. Should there be no objection in principle, I should insist on full details being furnished for your consideration before shipment of the goods Imx from Europe. impression is that the majority of the articlesI O't 7# articles could not be splitiminto sizes and weights suitable for pack transport - in which case the Sinkiang Government, of whose lack of foresight this is a typical instance, may have reason to regret that Mr* Burchan did not stipulate in his contracts for delivery at Urumchi. 5 . 1 am sending a copy of this letter to the Kesident in Kashmir.

The principal correspondents are the Government of India Foreign and Political Department, the India Office Political Department, HM Consulate-General at Kashgar [Kashi], and Lieutenant-Colonel Reginald Charles Francis Schomberg. There are also a small number of letters received from Chinese officials, comprising: Pan Tsi-Lu, an Agent of the Governor of Sinkiang in Kashgar; the Peking Representative of the Sinkiang Provincial Government; and the Ministry of War.The following topics are discussed in the correspondence dated 1932-1933: the initial approach to purchase mining machinery, aeroplanes and munitions from the Government of India or from British companies; further orders from Switzerland and Germany; arrangements for transporting materials to Sinkiang via India; negotiations to purchase arms and ammunition from Vickers-Armstrongs Limited; and the position of the Government of India with regard to the embargo on providing arms to China or Japan. Quotations from Vickers-Armstrongs can be found at folios 47-54, and 65-68.The file contains several letters from Lieutenant-Colonel Schomberg, discussing: his role as an intermediary between the Government at Sinkiang and the Government of India; the reluctance of Chinese officials to deal with the Consulate-General at Kashgar (Nicholas Fitzmaurice); the difficulties he faced as a result of his unofficial position; Russian influence at Urumchi [Urumqi] and in East Turkestan; and his views on the Government of India's diplomatic policy.At the front of the file is a small quantity of correspondence dated 1937, regarding a request for arms and ammunition received from the Tungan [Dungan or Hui] Government at Sinkiang. This includes discussion of the position of neutrality to be adopted towards Southern Sinkiang, the need to obtain permission from the Central Government at Nanking, and the possible application of the Barcelona Convention on the Freedom of Transit (1921).The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references found within the file by year.
