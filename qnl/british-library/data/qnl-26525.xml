The scheme for the construction of the Mecca- Arafat and Mecca-Jedda-Medina roads hy the joint efforts of the Saudi Government and the Egyptian Waqfs Department is still in the project stage. Tenders for the work v/ere called for in Egypt some months ago, and representatives of various companies came to the Hejaz to examine the roads in question, hut the contracts have not yet been granted. It is said that cabinet changes and electoral delays in Egypt have delayed a decision, but a local story which may have something in it is that thejEgyptians want to have the management of the business and the Saudi Government object to this as another attempt to extend Egyptian influence in this country - possibly with an eye to an Egyptian caliphate.14 6130 17148 ( 4 ) and address —not to any person by nawk, “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London INDIA DIRECT 17 C0L ‘•/a*. cp:~} unioution on this 4ihject, pieasefiuote 1 r f 'i '7 • Z w * 0 I ^ 0 inv verson bo name, but to— ’ s jj a T 19 38 j THE Under-Secretary of State for |/)reign Affairs pre^its his compliments to and, by direction of the Secretary transmits herewith cop^, of the under-mentioned paper.

Col. Etherton left Jedda in May, 1936 and then, and during a subsequent visit later in the year, when as you are aware he was accompanied by Col. Micklem and was concerned to secure a gold-mining concession from the Saudi Arab Government, evinced no further interest in the questions of motor transport in Saudi Arabia. Nothing more has been heard of Mr. C .H. 1 'ancred, representative of the Dunlop Rubber Co. Ltd. , to whom a reference was made in my predecessor’s despatch. 3. The proposal to establish a motor transport service from 'Uqair to Mecca, which Ibn Saud is reported to be eager to promote through his Indian chauffeur, Sadiq, is stated by the latter to have made sufficient progress to justify some optimism. Sadiq recently informed a member of my staff that he had come to an arrangement with a Swedish company to supply all the motor vehicles required, though the terms of The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C. , M.P., etc. , etc. , etc. payment/- @ ^ paymeat had still to be settled. He had also been in correspondence with Messrs. Thos. Cook and Sons, Ltd., who had agreed to take up the agency for India for the company eventually to be formed, though they appeared to entertain some doubt whether the Government of India would approve the booking of pilgrims from that country by the new route. In this connection, it will be recollected that this Legation has on several occasions expressed the view that pilgrims should be discouraged from using overland routes until these are sufficiently well-organised and an efficient transport service assured. 4. On the 13th October the baut al Hejaz announced the formation of a Roads Commission for the improvement of roads in this country. It was also stated that a special tax an travellers by car and camel was to be levied in order to provide funds for the activities of the Commission, which would be responsible to the Ministry of Finance. Subsequently it was ascertained by private enquiry that the tax was that introduced in the pilgrim tariff for the forthcoming Haj, details of which were transmitted to His Excellency the Viceroy in my despatch No.97 (1735/351/32) of the 5th October last, a copy of which was sent to the Foreign Office with my printed despatch No.277^Of the same date. This Commission may be expected to confine itself to work on the roads of the Hejaz used by pilgrims and to co-operate with Egyptian road-engineers who, under the Saudi-Egyptian Treaty, are to undertake extensive works of road-construction in the Hejaz. One Egyptian engineer has already arrived and is reported to have commenced work. The Roads Commission are stated to have been responsible for certain minor repairs and alterations of alignment of the Mecca-Jedda and Jedda-Medina roads, but it is not considered/@ i£ considered that these amount to a real and permanent improvement. 5. It is reasonable to suppose that the interest of the Saudi authorities in road construction has been stimulated by the achievement of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate Ltd. in constructing the road from Jedda to the ’’Got of Gold' mine, on which I have reported separately. Latterly it has been reported that Mr. Twitchell, during a recent visit to Riyadh, believed to have been connected with negotiations for the extension of the area of the Syndicate's concession, offered to construct a first-class motor-road from Riyadh to the Hejaz as part of the bargain. The Syndicate, of course, already have a useful quantity of road-making machinery in the country. 6. For the sake of completeness, it may be mentioned that Nawab Ahsan Yar Jung, an engineer in the service of the Hyderabad Government, mentioned in paragraph 6 of my predecessor’s despatch under reference, has also entertained the idea of applying for a concession from the Saudi Government for a motor-transport service in the Hejaz. His scheme, in so far as it was privately communicated to the Legation, was too grandiose to be practical. 7. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Department of Overseas Trade, the Government of India, Bagdad and Bushire. I have , &lt;ete .

The cancellation was to take effect as from the 14th June, the date of the communique. 2. I understand that an announcement has appeared in the press to the effect that proceedings have been instituted in the Madras courts for the winding up of the Company formed by Doctor Jeelani in India for the purposes of this concession. I have no direct confirmation of this but it is in any case clear that the whole project is dead for the time being. It never offered any prospect of commercial success in present pilgrimage conditions. though The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., K.C.V.O., etc., etc. , etcthough it might have been expected to make a greater appeal in India than it has done to support as an unremunerative work of piety. 3.

Sir, I am surprised at the letter written by Mr. C. Mohd. Sibgatullah in your valuable Daily of the 1st July, and also his open letter of the 5th July. The whole scheme is essentially a religious-c/rw-busmess venture, towards the success of which I expect every Muslim in India to do his best, failing which, in any event, I expect no Muslim will actually harm or hinder its success in any form. This matter has been published in detail by the Press in all Muslim inhabited portions of the world, and nobody, barring this single instant, have had anything to say against it. I have just returned from an All-India tour, and I found that even Muslims who are against Sultan Ibn Saud, and differ with him on some religious matters, are in favour of this scheme, merely to help the cause of the pilgrims, of which India sends out the largest number. I wish to re-assure Mr- Sibghatullah that I am fully aware that the season of pilgrim traffic is only for about 5 to 6 months in the year, but there is always a local traffic of 50 to 60 people daily, with a very fair amount of goods traffic during the other portion of the year. This alone will bring in a sufficient and appreciable income. I have a personal idea of this during my two recent visits to Mecca, and from well informed statistics. Taking the pilgrim traffic at its lowest, I am quite confident of the railway bringing in a gross income of at least 7 lakhs from pilgrim traffic and their luggage, and 7 lakhs from goods traffic per annum, even at rates far below the present rates of Rs- 20 per head by motors, and Rs. 12 per head by camel, excluding their luggage. Statistics show that the goods traffic between Jeddah and Mecca will also be appreciably good. It will be interesting to note that the town of Mecca and its surround ings have to depend on everything, such as rice, wheat, clothing, building materials, etc., from the imported articles that are landed at Jeddah Port. Nearly 15 lakhs of bags alone are imported at Jeddah yearly, and the major portion of this sent to Mecca- We have been assured by the foreign offices at Jeddah and by the Hedjaz2 Government that the goods traffic alone will be more than enough to run and maintain the railway and pay a decent dividend to share holders. The total working expenses for the whole year is about 5 lakhs, and we have about 9 lakhs left over for reserve, a decent dividend to shareholders, and all other provisions. It should be noted that the only important income of the Hedjaz Government is from pilgrim traffic, the major portion of which is Indian. It is therefore assuredly believed that even from the economic point of view, the railway will prove a blessing to H. M. Sultan Ibn Saud’s Government, and highly profitable to the Company. The entire control of the railway being in the hands of the Company for 50 years is a guarantee for the vast investment proposed to be made. The Hedjaz Government agreed to take up 15,000 shares out of the 1 lakh shares, and have also promised to help us sell a large number in its territories. To further the progress Of the proposed railway, H. M. the Sultan has kindly consented to exempt the Railway Company from Customs Duty on all materials imported for the railway for a period of 50 years and over. In return, the Company has to pay the Sultan 2£ per cent, on the net income yearly. The originator of this idea is myself, and I have been at it for the past 3 years to the best of my ability, and during which time, I have had to run up to Arabia twice. The whole scheme was discussed by the official committee consisting of various ministers and high officials of the Sultan, and next by a non-official committee of various merchants of Jeddah, Mecca and Medina, and it is need less to say they have granted the concession solely on my name only after fully enquiring and satisfying themselves about my capacity to undertake the responsibility. If Mr. Sibghatullah had genuine doubts, he could have called on me, or called for me, instead of rushing to the Press in this alarming manner, and I would have been too glad to furnish him with details. If Mr. Sibghatullah still wants further details, I shall be only too pleased to furnish him with same- S. A. K. JEELANI.JEDDAH-MECCA RAILWAY—A REJOINDER. Sir, It is unfortunate that Dr. S. A. K. Jeelani has hopelessly misconstrued my letter of the 5th instant as is apparent from his reply published in the Indian Express of the 15th instant- Let me not for a moment be taken to imply that I am in any way opposed to the construction of a railway line between Mecca and Jeddah- On the other hand. I have in my said letter pointedly referred to the religious aspect of the proposal and have described it as one which will appeal itself to every Mussalman not only in India but through out the world. I have even gone so far as to state in my above letter that the proposed railway will steadily add to the number of pilgrims and proportionately also to its earnings. This being so, I fail to understand why Dr. Jeelani singles me out as one who has had anything to say against the scheme. To say the least, Dr. Jeelani’s conclusion is totally unwarranted. A Limited Company, such as the one which Dr- Jeelani is endeavouring to float, can only materialise if the public which is invited to make an investment has sufficient confidence in the ven ture and in this particular instance the investor will naturally like to know what the terms of the agreement are which Dr. Jeelani has effected with the Sultan Ibna-i-Saud’s Government in view of the fact that the entire capital, whatever it may be, has to be expended in a foreign country. The public therefore has a right to know what that agreement is and unless a true translation of the entire agree ment is placed before it, it is impossible to form a correct idea of the success of the undertaking. So far what has appeared in the Press is a mere collection of extracts from the agreement and not the agreement itself. I would therefore again request Dr- Jeelani to publish the agreement in full accompanied by authoritative statis tics of the volume of pilgrim and goods traffic calculated on the basis of the last three or four years average- Without such figures even an approximation cannot be reached. Although I am in a position to show the unbusinesslike character of some of the extracts from the agreement which have already been published without any authority behind them, I desire reserving my criticism of them until Dr. Jeelani comes out with his translation of the original document.Solden &amp; Co., Madras, S.E. ~~W'V‘ SMS 4 Lastly, I think it is my duty to point out that the success of the undertaking will depend mainly, if not wholly, upon the capa bility of the managing agency viewed not by any standard set up by the Sultan’s Government but by a feeling of confidence which that agency is able to create in the mind of the ordinary investor.

No.1375/C dated 13th June 1933 from the Super intendent of Police, Special Branch, C.I.D. regarding Saiyid Abdul Khadir Jeelani Sahib of St. Thomas T s Mount, Madras. He is the proprietor of Messrs. Khader &amp; Yousuf Bros., Watch Makers, Madras. The building is vorth about Rs. 30,000 and the business is approximately valued at about Rs. 350,000, but the concern is mortgaged, and interest is being paid at the rate of Rs.700/- a month. He owns a house at Alanthur, a suburb of St. Thomas f Mount, which is worth about Rs.10,000 and some mango gardens at Salem, which fetch him an annual income of about Rs.600. His two sons, who live apart from him, have been declared insolvents, he is the President of the First Class Bench at Alanthur.He held a meeting in Madras with leading Muslims, and acquainted them with his scheme, hut they do not appear to have offered him their support. It appears to he true that certain Muslims belonging to the Ghair-i-Mukhallid, Delhi, Benares, and other places in the North, have promised support to the scheme, Jeelani Sahih poses as a leading member of this section of Muslims, One Hamid-ulla Sahib, Secretary of the Ahili Hades conference, Dawood Ismail Atta of Rangoon, and some others, have written, signifying their willing ness to support the scheme, but so far no financial contributions have been made by any of them. He visited Hyderabad last April to interview the Nizam, but the latter refused to see him, and Jeelani Sahib was advised to register a company and get it recognised, when the Nizam could be approached again. Acting upon this advice, he returned to Madras and again interviewed the leading Muslims of this City, but was unsuccessful in persuading any of them to support him. Each one said'that he would join him and take shares after others had done so. He intends to visit Bombay shortly for propaganda work in this connection, and it is said that he will visit the Khilafat office with a view to influence Maulana Shaiikat All and other Khilafat leaders. It is reported that ShaiJkat Ali is not in favour of the scheme, but Jeelani Sahib hopes to convert him.

Sir John Simon suggests for the consideration of Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare that it would be of interest to ascertain the views of the Government of India upon Dr. Jeelani’s proposals and upon the prospect of his being able to secure adequate financial support and to secure the carrying out^the project in a satisfactory manner. 3.

The Under Secretary of State, India Office.No*63* (580/200/20) British egtition, Jedda* 28th February 1935. Mr, With referei.ee to Hr* Hope aill’e printed despatch No.55 of February 18 relative to the scheme for a railway between bedtia end Mecca, I have the honour to state that Dr* b.A* -• cieelani left for India on Feoruary £4. His negotiations with the ba'Qdi uovernment* after going though at least one almost desperate stage, seem to have resulted in the conclusion of an agreement, which has been sanctioned by Ibn la*tid but which still needs to be endorsed by br«jeelani 6 backers in India. It has never ueen clear how far he enjoys definite support in that country. My impression is that he has the moral support of some Moslen group there but has now to Induce them to finance the business. ‘live principal terms of the agreement ere t&amp;id to oe as follows *- (a) The proiaoters to provide capital to the aaouat of 50 lacs of rupees. (b) The promoters to lend the La^di Government 10 lacs of rupees, repayable by instalments out of the lovernacnt’e share In the gross receipts. (c; The Lovernment to get 504 of the gross receipts.ihe remainder to be divided in stated proportion© between the concessionaries, who will be responsible for all working and working expenses, ana charitable objects in the hejas. / (A) The Ight Honourable, Mr v ohn Mmon, 0*0* .1., K.C.V. etc., etc., etc*(d) The fare each way to he ii Gold 1 for pllijrliaa arid leas for ordinary travellers and persona travelling outelde the pilgrim season* (e) The concession to he valid for 50 years, »uoject prouably to some arrangement for possible termination alter a shorter period, 5* The arrangement appears to be extremely favourable to the government, although it muet be noted in coimexion with (dy above that the t&gt;0 eh&amp;x^ in gross receipts i© intended to compeusate them for the sacrifice of revenue from l.osh&amp;n' or road tax charged on all, except a email numuer of privileged pen one, travelling by oai' ox' samel* 4. I share the view expressed by Mr* Hope Gill in his despatch Tto*433 of beosmber 19 that this project is unpx'actical in the ce JBe that it rests on no round financial or economic basis# It ia nevertheless (iuite possible that it will at&amp;ract enough support in India on religious grounds to make it workable as an unremunerative pious enterprise# I am told that the promoters hope to start construction next autumn, 5# I know nothing of the group in India behind br# ^eela d* I have heard it described as the Uades Syndicate# .he lllxam of ilyuerabad has also been mentioned as a possibly interested party but the ]ll£am t &amp; name ha© been so much tandled about of late in connexion with possible as&amp;l&amp;tance of one sort or another to Ibn La'dd that I attach little importance to this suggestion# 5# I am sending copies of tills despatch to the department of Overseas Trade and the Goverxunent of India# I have tlie honour to be with the hi^ieet respect.

Ibn Oe f M showed interest and ordered the hegislativ Assembly to study the matter. Their first reaction was to refuse in principle the granting of a conceueion to any foreign Moslems. Recalled to the practical aspects, they oe first deposited ©nd negotiations then begun on a basis of the payment of 60; profits to the ba’Hui uovernment, V&amp;i to shareholders, and 26^ to chai’ity in the He jam and Iruiia equally. i&gt;r.

The railway proposed from Jidda to : eeca will lie entirely In the province of iiejaa in Arabia, running from Jidda (Let* H*21 50’, Long* R.S9 45’) a dletance of approximately fifty ailes. Ko maps baaed on a topographical survey of this region are available and the plan that accompanies this project has been prepared after i4r.H*J. %Philby f C # X«*, »X.G»3», who croooed over the Arabian Seninaula from Ormu* to Jidda on a political mission in 1917, Ilia route was carefully plotted out from rough surveys with a prismatic compass, and he did not touch the holy city of Mecca on hie route, but was under political obligation to traverse the eninsula ten miles to the north of the holy city. Thus, his route strikes the Jidda-iocca road at the village of Hadda, whence he was permitted to proceed by the Jid&amp;a-Mecca road to jedda* From the descriptions of this political agent and from those of other European travellers, it is learnt that all alonj the eastern shores of the Red £ea extends a desert plain, from the Gulf of Akaba to the Straits of abelmandeb varying in width from fifty miles to two miles at certain places. Rising precipitously froa this plain toward© the east are the mountains of iiedjas, which show a distinct escarpment on their western front, while towards the east they gently slope off towards the heart of the Arabian desert. The holy city of Mecca lies shrouded amidst the hills on the western slopes of this mountain range. The alignment of the railway line over this region will have to be ohosen very carefully on account of the gradients, arid also on account of the Intercepting water-ways, which though dried up for the major part of the year, flow full and with considerable velocity during the rainy season. There is great scarcity of water all over the route and it is doubtful whether boiler-water of sufficient purity can be obtained anywhere over this route of fifty eileo. At Jidda it&amp;eli people /areore dependent upon rain-water for drinking purposes which, they catch and store in large cisterns. Under the circuiasttnces, we have 'iropooed to use Ulesel Electric I ocomotivea Cor ti’action, as auch engines ax*e entirely independent of water, as they have no ^oilers* . a li,^en.t * The first ten miles fi^om Jidda to daghama conoiste of a dead level plain and it is proposed to construct the railway line along the geodetic arc frosa Jidda to Raghajaa and from i&amp;ghanta to 2d ja&amp;lya, another ten miles of fairly level plain where much of ombaateientB or cutting would not he necessary# From ijadiya to Jahri and Bahra to iiodda and hadda to Mecca the line would traverse a distinctly mountainous district and the alignment will have to be carefully choaen to minimise the cost of construction and the crossing of waterways, provision has been made for this, as the first twenty miles are estimated at the rate stendardloed oy the Government of India for ailw&amp;y construction in the plains, and in the second section of mountainous district provision has been made for frequent embankments and cuttings and occasional crossing of water-ways# iiftngm . ajb ha© been requested, the estimate has been based on the re .iuli'eiaente of raetre gauge llnea and In thin connection we woul' obBCi-we that there would he a great advantage In ualng the eume gauge for this railway ac la the gauge now used on the railway line from eyrouth to liamaacua and from iiamaaeue to iadlna. slth the development of cowaeroe that this railway la sure to bring with It, It la only a aueaUon of tine for rfadlna to be United up with lecca by a railway line and consequently, if the change ol i,aut,e should arlee at Mecca, It would be a very great disadvantage to both the railway syotens, a disadvantage which la considerably idlt now at uxor, where the Egyptian railway gauge changes from 4'ai* to 3'6'. however we leave thin question open to the directlem for final decision. ArafflQ .AagilQ * 'Phe bulk of the baffle on this line oonsiete of pilgrim traffic from Jidda to ecca* From the data available it haa been eatlniated that thin traffic in the year 1980 amounted to 180,000 paeoengere from Jidda to ^leoca and baclu Jidda itself had an Import trade valued at £.1,030,000 in the year 1920 conaiating largely of rice, wheat and other foodstuffs exported from India to Jidda, fhe export trade is comparatively poor and amounted only to £.23,000 sterling, fhe balance of trade is maintained by actual export of specie, a large portion of this being bx»ought in by the incoming pilgrims. F*rom the statistics available for the year 1920 it is reported that 180,000 persona visited I ecca by the Jidda route, of which 88,000 were pilgrims from India, 13,000 from Java and the £ traits v ettlements and the balance from Turkish territory, from &amp;gypt and other countries. Jidda is not touched by any direct s leaners and transhipment has been to be adopted at Aden for steamers for Jedda. From the statistics of 1920 it is noted that 334 steamships were engaged in the Import trace at Jidda out of which 833 were British ships. Uonstguctlon ojxK-flttcau It ia proposed to construct this railway* first the section froa Jidda to IJadlya. Vhia aeotlon should be constructed as quickly as possible and brought into use; and then only subsequent section from lljadlya to jv&amp;cea taken up. Thus there would be very little of capital lying idle as, as soon as the section to 1 jadiya is over, the line would have commenced, provision has also been made in this estimate for a short harbour- line to facilitate landing and transport of machinery and other heavy railway materials, a length of three miles being required for tills purpose* Provision has also been made for a railway jetty at which such heavy materials and goods could be landed with facility. On the completion of the line, this jetty could also be thrown open to pilgrims who wish to land direct on the wharf and to proceed direct to !lecoa without touching at Jidda. The location of the /railwayrailway station at Jidda hac been placed juet outside ttie Mecca Gate in the greet plain, where land can be had very cheap, similarly it ia proposed to place Hie station of Mecca in the plain adjoining ladl Fatima Immediately to the west of the city of eccu and just outside It. Genital Goat ,4 r^tlmate . ’fhe aee^ip&amp;bying eeUaate gives detailed coat per mile under various heads and the figures are based on the statistics of the Indian railway io&amp;rd with suitable modifications to in** meet the topography of the country and the general waterless character of the plains traversed. This has particular reference to the rates fixed for culverts and minor bridges and the permanent way which will consist of steel rails 60 lbs. per yard, provision has also been made in this estimate for the station buildings, workshops, loco-sheds, staff quarters, store houses, storage tanks for crude oil and fresh water wells; capital coot of these being estimated at Indian standard , tstes* tolling stock eetimate includes the cost of nieeel iilectric Locomotives and passenger cars and Goods waggons. A large portion of the Goods waggons of the open type have been estimated for, as much of the traffic on thia line will consist of grains and food stuffs in bags, provision has also been made in this estimate for a telegraph line carrying three wires on which will be worked block signalling apparatus, simple Morse telegraphic circuit connecting Mecca with Jidda on the orae circuit and the telephone on phantom circuit. Vhe estimate also includes the cost of preliminary and Demarcation t urveys. Mo cost of land has been included, as this is believed to be given free by the Arabian Government. Revenues . The revenue estimates have been based entirely on the pilgrim traffic of 100,000 passengers per annum up and down from Jidda to Mecca and back, and also the goods traffic which Is estimated to bring in about 5 lakhs of revenue per annua. /AuthoritiesAuthorities available eatlmate the pilgrim traffic on the Jidda- Mecea route at 120,000 in the year 1920. Increased facility of trade and locomotion hue, no doubt, added to this figure in the p&amp;et decade, but smeh addition hae not been taken into consideration in the estimate. With the px^oviislon of a railway line from Jidda to Mecca and other facilities that the railway would bring with it, the bulk of the pilgrim traffic especially from India that is now diverted via . eyrouth and Damascus will find itself on the Jid&amp;a- Mecca route, ae a far cheaper and more comfortable route would be adopted. Kven auch expanaion hae not been taken into consideration in thla estimate* Under revenue expenditure liberal provision has been made for re-construction and re-laying of track that may be nec^e&amp;ary due to invasion of Band, a phenomenon now observed on the liandapam-DhanuBtikodi section of the »/Outh Indian railway and on the Delhi- dkaneer line in Hajputcma* Liberal provision has also been made for repairs of machinery and building®. The estimate also covers a large item for advertisement, as liberal advertisement in the ] ohamedon countries is sure to bring all the pilgrirae on to this railway line as it is cheaper and better. The question of passenger fare is to be decided by the Direction, but we have fixed it at 1*6 annas per mile per passenger which would make it Re.l for every ten miles and ito.5 for the fifty mile journey as the most economic rate. Thia is a very advantageous rate compared with what is now charged by motor buses from Jidda to kecca, which ie he.20. per seat* It would not be poeaible for these buses to substantially reduce the rates as the wear and tear of the machinery must be considerable and once the railway is establiahed the bus service is bound to ©top or will find itself in the run from Mecca to Medina, in which case these buses would act as feeder to this railway system. A sum of Rs*8,00,GOO has been set apart for the reserve fund which for the railway is an ample annual provision. Further detail® arc available in the revenue estimate itself. Vov /enon &amp; Co.

Representative, Jedda, No.405 of 26th September. envoy of Ibn Saud(E.4299/704/25) Translation of Article published by 'Lavoro Fascista' August 17, 1952. An Envoy from King Ibn Saud arrives in Italy on a Technical Mission. TURIN, August 16. Yesterday there passed through the Porta Nuova station here the Minister, Mohamed Rafaat El Ahdale, special Envoy of the Mecca Government to Italy. The Minister, as soon as he arrived at Turin from Genoa, went to Cavoretto for a few days* rest. Mohamed Rafaat El Ahdale is a true Arab from Mecca, and a distinguished engineer, who has been sent by King Ibn Saud to Italy on a special mission with the special object of working out a new and comirehensive organisation for communications in his country corresponding to road and transit conditions there. During his visit to Turin Rafaat El Ahdale showed considerable interest also in the aerodrome. He was impressed by the high degree of perfection which we have reached in various spheres of engineering and electricity and particularly by those of our factories which can successfully compete with the greatest enterprises abroad. Mohamed Rafaat el Ahdale, who is paying his first visit to Europe, travelled in an Italian steamer, and is enthusiastic on the subject of the Italian mercantile marine* In reply to questions by representatives of the press Mohamed Rafaat El Ahdale, stated that his country under therule of Ibn Saud is at present enjoying a period of peaceful prosperity.♦ JEDDA. No.405. September 26th, 1932* (2844/411/22). Sir, In your printed despatch No.295 (E.4299/704/25) of August 31, you enclosed a translation of an article published in the 'Lavoro Fascista' of August 17, to the effect that 'the Minister, Mohamed Rafaat el Ahdale, a true Arab of Mecca and a special Envoy from King Ibn Sa’ud to Italy' had arrived at Turin. 2. This man is a Syrian chauffeur who was formerly employed by ex-King 'Ali at Jedda and has more recently been engaged by the Mecca Municipality to drive its mechanical water-sprinkler. Receiving no pay, he opened a repair-shop of his own and concentrated on worn-out Fiats. As the Hejazi Government own a number of these, they contracted with him for their repair, and upkeep, ana eventually assisted him to visit Italy in search of spare parts. He is no more a Minister of Ibn Sa'ud’s than is that Turk, Jamal Pasha al Ghazzi, who was pricurer-in-chief to the Amir Feysal in 1930, styled himself as 'Hejazi Minister for War' while in Syria in 1931, and is now in India representing himself to the press as 'Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs'. 3. Nevertheless, there is a certain move on foot, attributed to Sheykh ’Abdullah Suleyman as holder of the portfolios of Finance and Pilgrimage, to bring all motor- transport under Government ownership before the next pilgrimage season opens. This would certainly entail extensive repairs to existing vehicles and might necessitate the purchase of new stock. At present, however, none of the local motor-car agencies - and those of Ford, Chevrolet, His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. and/@ 2 . and Fiat are the chief - will look at any terms other than half cash with order and the balance on delivery. 4.
