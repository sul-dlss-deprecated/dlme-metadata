During the quarter under report a considerable number of British and American planes have been flying over Nepalese territoiy. The Nepalese have always objected to planes flying over Nepalese territoiy (a) because of the Pundits* objections to it on religious grounds (* 1 )) because to them it represents a denial of their independence and presents opportunity of aerial photography of Nepal. The Maharaja has realised that a large number of planes are being flown from West to East over India from centres such as Karachi, Delhi, Ambala and Lahore and that, latitud- inally, a part of Nepal lies in the way. Also that many of the pilots are probably young British and Americans ■who have never been East before* These two facts would probably account for planes passing over Nepalese territoiy. However, he has periodically provided the Minister with list of planes that have flown over and has asked him to infom the Govemoent of India so that they msy take the necessary steps to prevent its continuing. Such steps have been and are being taken by the Government of India., CONFIDENTIAL. COPY British Legation, Nepal, 8th Ma^, 1942. D.O.No. 2-C/42.

I assured him that Japanese bombers could not reach any portion of Nepal yet but that I agreed that our aerpplanes should not fly over Nepalese territory if it can possibly be avoided but, I added, it was useless for me to tell the Government of India vaguely that planes-had flown over.

If there is no objection I would be grat-ful if this information could be passed on to Air Force Headquarters with the request that they will warn airmen against flying over Nepalese territory but that if this should mean that planes must make long detours - expensive and delayed - the whole matter may be reviewed and I may be given sufficient comprehensive orders and reasons which will give me an opportunity of discussing the matter with the Nepalese Government. 6.

Tills would make it impossible for them to permit any civil aircraft to cross this belt even for scientific purposes or at the invitation of the Nepalese Government* 2. The alleged violation is the first of which the Ne^B-lese authorities have complained for seven years and no action would therefore appear to be necessary beyond that which has already been taken by the Govern ment of Bihar. 1 3. With regard to your reference to the Afghan and Iranian borders, I am to point out that the whole of the North £est Frontier Province and the adjoining political agencies and tlie greater part of Baluchistan are prohibited -—2 prohibited areas, which cannot bo flown over at all by civil aircraft.

Please refer to the correspondence resting with my demi-official letter Ho.266-P., dated the 19th January, 1939, regarding the flying of an aeroplane over Nepalese territory on the afternoon of 29th December, 1938. As a result of an enquiry made it appears that no aeroplane except the one belonging to Mr. Fairweather had flown on that date and that ‘«4r too did not really fly over the Nepalese territory. A copy of Mr. Fairweather's letter addressed to bwanzy explaining exactly his course is enclosed. It is probable that the Maharaja of Nepal is referring to this aeroplane whose course was misjudged by the people in Nepal. Mr. Fairweather is however being informed through bWanzy not to fly in future on a course which would invlove any likelihood of crossing the Nepalese boundary without obtaining previous permission from the British Legation, Nepal. He is also being told that it is not necessary for him to write a personal letter to the Maharaja of Nepal unless you consider this advisable. £Copy of a letter No.3045, dated the 23rd/34th January, 1 j 39, from tor. W.M.Fairweather. Uuzaffarpur, to H.^.dMansy, ^^.,103., Commissioner, Tirhut Division, Muzaffarpur. I thank you for your D.O.No.46, dated the 21st instant. I regret to aeu that the Nepalese Government liave informed you that I flew into their territory on the 29th December. This is not correct. What actually happened was tiiat I received the enclosed letter from Dr. &gt;• Gedaea, whom I personally do not know asking me if I could fly him over North Behar, the same as he has been flown over Bengal and other places, so that he could look at the different colours of the soil formation from the air. He arrived here by the midday train of the 26th, after lunch I took him roughly on a three hour flight from Muzaffarpur right up the railway line to the Koshi, and then back along the Terai to Rajnagur, and down the railway line again to Muzaffarpur as he wanted to fill in the details of the different types of soil on the map he had. You can verify this from the various people whose bungalows I passed over tbit I went right up the railway line to the Koshi, and then 1 went over towards Pumeah, and showed him the waste lands there. As he was anxious to get a view of the snow range, I went up to a height of about 12000 ft right above the clouds, and when Mr. Geddes had liad a look at the hills for about five minutes, I came down to the Koshi again and set a compass course for Bajnag&amp;r which at one part caraa about 1/4 mile south of the Nepal border. I gather from the letter that when my plane was well above the clouds, the people on the border heard it, ana imagined it was flying into Nepal. The j/ border of Nepal lies rough#/ 20 mile, north of where I joined the Koahi, and I then climbed right above the clouds heading / i north for about 10 miles, I then circled round looking at Everest etc. and then came back down south. In any case if a complaint has been raised, I cim very sorry indeed and make my apologies.

The information contained therein that no other ae. uplane except the one belonging to Mr. Fairweather of Muzaffarpur had flown on the 29th December 1938 ani that he was being cautioned against taking a course in flying in future which would involve a likelihood of approaching very near or crossing the Nepal boundary has been noted with thanks. There is no mistake in the fact reported from Bannajia thit an aeroplane was seen flying ov^r that place steering northwards ind back again after a few minutes. Km Bannajia lies several miles inland from the Nepal-British border the appearance of the aeroplane tnere on a fine da^ could not have been due to the pilot having lost his bearing owing to atmospheric disturbance. However in view of the information kindly given by you about the action taken I desire to say that I do not see any necessity of asking Mr. Fairweather to write a personal letter to my in the matter. 7 »GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.

Ceylon. 5. Ceylon is a party to the International Convention for Air Navi gation. Customs clearance is necessary on flights between India and Ceylon in both directions. Health inspection is carried out at Colombo on the arrival of aircraft carrying passengers. The pilot of an aircraft not carrying passengers is responsible that any case of sickness of members of the crew is reported to the Police. At least 12 hours’ prior notice of the flight should be given to the Registrar of Aircraft, Colombo (Telegraphic addresss—“ AERONAUTIC, COLOMBO ”) in order that arrangements may be made for the customs clearance of the aircraft. The notice should state whether passengers will be carried and will be sent, on request, by the Aerodrome Officer, Madras. Persons domiciled in India who are British subjects do not require to be in possession of passports. Passports are, however, necessary in the case of foreign nationals. An aircraft entering Ceylon should land at the Ratmalana (Colombo) Aerodrome.

Nepal, Tibet and Bhutan. 9. No flights may be undertaken across the border which separates British India from Nepal, Tibet and Bhutan without the previous P er ’ mission in writing having been obtained in each case, through the Civil Aviation Directorate, from the Government of the country or countries concerned. Afghanistan. 10. Permission cannot be granted for flights between India and Afghanistan owing to the prohibited areas in North West India, which extend from Lat. 26° N. in the Kalat State to the Northern extremity of the North-West Frontier Province (Lat. 37° N. approximately). Arab States in the Persian Gulf. H Permission for flights over the Arab States in the Persian Gulf cannot be granted. Only the aircraft of Imperial Airways, Ltd., are permitted to make use of the route westward from Gwadar via Sharjah, Bahrein and Koweit. Iran. 12. Iran is not a party to the International Convention for Air Navigation and the permission of the Iranian Government (through the Aero Club of India and Burma, or the Civil Aviation Directorate, Govern ment of India) must be obtained for flights to Iran and such permission will only remain valid for a period of two weeks from the notified date of arrival. Application for permission should be made at least 20 days in advance (except in extraordinary or emergent cases when a notice of at least three days should be given). Applications should always state whether or not wireless apparatus will be carried. Should the flight be delayed notification should at once be made to the Iranian Government5 through the British Legation, Tehran, giving information as to the reason for the delay and the revised date of arrival in Iran. 13. A letter of guarantee in respect of customs duties is required from the pilot of an aircraft on entry into Iran. The guarantee will take the form of an undertaking signed by the pilot himself and will specify the value of the aircraft and any goods carried and the customs charges that would be payable. No bank guarantee is required and the jg document does not require verification by an Iranian authority outside Iran. After departure of the aircraft from its last landing place in Iran has been notified to the first landing place the letter of guarantee will be cancelled, or if requested by the pilot it will be returned to him through the British Legation or Consulate. Medical Regulations.—Iran and countries to the West. 14. Medical regulations affecting air navigation are enforced in Iran, Egypt, Iraq and other countries west of Iran. In particular medical certificates under articles 32 and 35 of the International Sanitary Conven tion for Aerial Navigation (for inoculation against cholera within less than 6 months and more than 6 days, and for vaccination against small pox within less than 3 years and more than 12 days) are required by the Public Health authorities in Egypt, Iraq and Iran whether the person concerned has proceeded from a place infected with or free from these diseases. China. 15. The Chinese Government normally require permission to be obtained for flights of civil aircraft over their territory. Application for permission should be made through the Director of Civil Aviation in India or the Aero Club of India and Burma, giving the longest possible period of notice. Siam. 16. Siam is a party to the International Convention for Air Navi gation. Aircraft entering Siam must make their first landing at the customs aerodromes at Don Muang (Bangkok) or Pitsanuloke, must cross the frontier by the prescribed corridors and follow the obligatory air routes laid down. Prior notification of flight is required whether or not a landing is contemplated in Siamese territory. For flights to Don Muang, advance notice of two days is required and for flights to Pitsanuloke three days. Notification of all flights to or across Siamese territory should be made direct by the pilot himself to the Siamese Royal Aero nautical Department at Don Muang. (Telegraphic address—Aerodrome, Don Muang, Siam). 17. If it is intended to fly over any part of Siam except along one of the obligatory routes the previous permission of the Siamese Government is necessary and should be obtained direct by the pilot concerned from the same authority. The application should give the usual particulars and should state the address to which a reply should be sent. It should heparticularly noted that between Victoria Point and Alor Star there is no pres* cribed air route. It is therefore necessary to obtain special permission to fly along this route although no landing in Siamese territory may be proposed. Pilots are warned that during the wet season (May to October) squalls and thunderstorms are particularly prevalent during the afternoon in Upper Siam. Part II.—General Regulations. Prior permission or notification. 18. Before a regular service can be operated to any place outside British India prior permission must be obtained through the Director of Civil Aviation in India. Prior permission for casual flights to or over countries which are not parties to the International Convention for Air Navigation is also invariably required. 19. For casual flights to or over countries which are signatories to the International Convention for Air Navigation, although prior permission is not required, in most cases a prior notification with regard to the flight is necessary.

Confidential. Foreign Office, May 17, 1937. Foreign Air Touring by Royal Air Force Pilots. Sir, I AM informed by the Air Ministry that they have under consideration a scheme to encourage foreign touring by air among pilots of the Royal Air Force and of its reserves. The Air Ministry consider that the practical experience of air routes and air navigation, in foreign countries in which these pilots may in certain circumstances be required to operate in time of war, is of the highest value from a training point of view. This experience cannot be obtained by the pilots in their service capacity to the extent desired. On the other hand the cost of Hying in foreign countries is too high to permit more than a small percentage of pilots to obtain such experience in a civil capacity. 2. In these circumstances the Air Ministry have put forward the proposal that a subsidy of 25s. for each hying hour should be granted to pilots of the Royal Air Force and its reserves in respect of hying carried out privately by pilots in civil aircraft over foreign countries. This subsidy would not cover commercial hights. 8. I shall be glad to receive your observations on the general desirability from the political point of view of this proposal in the light of the special conditions in the country in which you reside, and of the probable attitude of the Government of that country towards requests for permission for hights of this character, where such prior permission is needed. In considering this question you will no doubt take the opportunity of ascertaining the views of the Air Attache responsible for the country in which you reside. I am, with great truth and regard, Sir, Your obedient Servant, ANTHONY EDEN His Majesty’s Representative at (030/1987) 9225 15137-n</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00022c_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2018</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00022c</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2018</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 5/58 ‘Flights of foreign aircraft over Nepal’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1937/1942</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-12-20T23:41:28</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (28 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 30; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file is concerned with alleged violations of Nepalese territory by foreign aircraft.
