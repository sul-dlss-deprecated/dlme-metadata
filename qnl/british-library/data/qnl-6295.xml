January 16th. The ShaiKh sent to me a young man about 22 years of age who had oome into Kuwait with a Shagra caravan bringing a letter from Bin Jaluwi, Bin Baud's representative in Nejd. Ee called himsel Ali bin Abdullah bin Mahommad, claimed to be of the Shereefial family and a near relative of Ali Pasha bin Abdullah who now resides in Fgypt. Aocox^ding to his statement, he was born in Yemen but had beer studying in various places in Turkey since the outbreak of the war. He was just a private person with no wish to have anything to do witl: politics, or to taKe sides with any combatant. He was a mere student and now he wished to go on to Egypt or Sanna via India. He is Yair- -ish and Iooks mor Turk than Arab, speaKs Arabic grandiloquently, is flashily dre:»sed and wears a diamond ring which he flourishes while he talks. H e volunteered the information that Shareef Mahommad al Yamani and two Turkish officers fcstxaxM were at Hass south of Borei- -dah with camels carrying money etc for the Turkish troops in Yemen. This is the party who were believed to be and probably are in faot, the Turkish Mission to Bin Baud. January 25th . I returned to Kuwait after a visit to ^asra to find that Shaikh w abir had been ill for several days- it was sa&amp;d with malarial fever. January 27th.

They will not wish not wish to provoke tne british Government directly as theyare entirely dependant now on Kuwait and Zobeir. li* thought ^ advisbale, pressure oan be brought to bear on them to ina-Ke them dis- -oloee their intentions by excluding them from these markets until their ShaiKhs oome in and explain the meaning of their movements.

Learnigg that tuere was a cargo for othman al Rashid in the Customs, I requested tue Agents on no account to grant delivery of any goods with the mane C.R.H. or otxierwise known to be consigned to Otiiamn or Sons. The ShaiMi had already informed me that he had stopped Othmans business, but perhaps that was only for a day ! The Shaikh is in a great soate of mind about the fate of Othman There are guilty conoiences among the mercantile community, Othman was pronouncedly pro-Tunv too and I have no doubt that great pressure is being put on the Shaikh to rescue the man at all hazards from our clutches.

According ^o Ali, Mahommad al i&amp;mani as^ed him to convey a message to the ”Consul at Kuwait” to the effect that he desired to escape to us but that Bin S ud was holding up the party. This is I think the Turkish Mission known to be in Nejd sent to Bin Scaud with presenst. But Ali gives a rather different version of their object.

My dear Sir Feroy, 1 enclose a wemo of ray interview with liulla Salih whon I aen^ I'cr on receipt of news of the death of Shaikh Jabix*. There was only a very short period of uncertainty as tc ohe succession for Salim promptly toc-a command on his own initiative and ordered business to proceed as utruai (i.e. the shops to re- -main open) and fixed the funeral for one following day. He since conveyed me the Pall os t assurancea as regards his future policy, ne volunteered that when notifying Sediiiih Jabir's a oath he will not address din .iaahid and he will b-.ing me ny communi- - cations he should receive from that quarter or any other party with whom tue dritish Ghcvernment is not on friendly terms. As far as it is safe to prophecy I feel that 3alim beinh a man of character and some constancy will be an improvement upon Jabir. His austerity is not likely to tone down very greatly at his time of life and we must bear in mind the limitations of a straightlaoed Mohammadan with Wahabi leanings in our dealings with him. me says he wants my advise and X have begun by suggest -ing that these young Shaikhs of the as Sabah family will be far better employed in the desert looking after tne tribes and main- staining order in we linteidand than in loafing about in town with their bravos and pimps. jabir was too easy gomig and tae country close to Kuwait wa; gradually becoming unsafe.

A©ting on the instruotions oontainea in the Chiei* Politioal omoex-'B telegram, No.839 dated Basra 4th February, on reoeipt oi’ the news of Shaiich Jabir*E death X sent for the Secretary, Mulla Salih. The following is a translation of the memorandum of my in- -terview with the Secretary, made in my presence by the latter and approved by me 1 . — // Tno Sahib (i.e. the Political Agent) sent for me tod«,y at 10-30 (p.m. Arabio, equivalent to 3-30 p.m. !lnglish) said 'ShaiKl Jabir is dead”. I told him 'Yea', Ee said 'who is now the Shaikh?”. I said ”Salim”. He said ”1 concur inform him' . I sai&lt; 'very well' . He said 'Inform His Hxcelloncy SiiaiAti Salim that if he desires his succession to be acknowledged (or accepted) by the Government he should give an undertaking that he will follow the polioy of his illustrious father, tne late Shaikh Mubarak, (in relations) wit.i tue 4 uritish Government, assist our friends, oppose our enemies and out off all relations with them'. Mulla Salih proposed to put off convening this message until ax'ter the burial of Shaikh Jabir, but I requested him tc lose no time about it in order to damp down excitement p.nd prevent any oon- -tretemps occurring in the night. He agreed. At 7-30 p.m. Mulla Salih returned with the report that he had seen and spoken to Shaikh &amp; dim who agreed to give the as- -surances asked for by us and would address me on the subject in writing later. hieut-dolonel, Kuwait, 6th February lc!7. Political Agent, Kuwait.# February 13th. Shaikh Salla is v®ry busy introducing r«fora«. One of hla first acts wag to send for the Jews and forbid thea henceforth to distil liquor in Kuwait. The amount of drinking that had been going on in the place was becoming a scandal. I had occasion to speak of it seyeral times to the late Shalkheexouft and once cor via populo in his Mejliss in the market-place. Nothing was done however till Salim took the matter up. He is Inclined to Puritanism and strong liquor Is anathema to him. The Shaikh Is also dividing the city Into Mohallas or quarters, each under a Mukhtar or guardian who will be responsible for maintaining order in his quarter and for bringing all delinquencies to notice. Particularly he will be expected to keep an eye on all strangers nd report their goings on, if suspicious. Export duet^p Fish and House taxes have been abolished, and all Imports are now to pay a uniform ad valorem duty of 4 These and other reforms have been separately reported. They are viewed with favour by the people generally but no doubt those whose bad habits or private interests are affected will seek means of subverting the new re- -glme sooner or later. Detraction of the Shaikh willy probably be their chief weapon. The Cuetoms-Master and Mulla Salih, who are said to have feathered their neats rather too luxuriously, are being carefully watched and one Abdul Aziz bin Salim has been ap- -polnted Muf ’ tlah or superintendent over them. The Shaikh appears tobe genuinely anxious to put a stop to the illicit trade with Hail and Medina, but in this he will have en- -ormous difficulties to contend with. The other d y he sent for the principal merchnats, showed them a letter from me on the sub- -ject and threatened them with dire penalties, if they continued their blockade-running ventures. He warned thea he would not punish them in the mild franklsh way (byx i.e. by fine and laprlsn -sent) but would cut off the tongue of any offender he caught. It is to be hoped th|*at this threat will have an effect but the enormous profits of the traffic have so far proved too great a 9 temptation for even the best among them. The man who I feel is-j Is most to blaa« t ia Mulla Salih 9 the Secretary of the late Shaikh While continually pretending that he wished to further our ob- -jects, and accusing his waster to us of bein^ the real obstruc- -tlonist f I guessed at the time and I now feel fairly convinced that the illicit traffic went on with his full knowledge and it is now said that he took large bribes to let p;.ss carayans that were intended for u all and M edina (most of these however went through Kasim and not direct, as seems to be imagined in some quarters). This wiry kittle man is the cleverest politician here He has ingratiated himself with Bln Baud and Shaikh Khazaal and has made a great effort to gain the ear of the British authori ties. My predecessor had a very high regard for him and I too dmire his energy, ability and agreeable manners. But he dis likes our getting any news except through him and cannot refrain from throwing dust in our Nor has he assisted us in ob taining c mels, ships, stone or other commodities we had n ed of here. On the other hand the trouble between Nasir and his brother was to a great extent engineered by him. He had a spite against N&amp;air, because the latter had given us information of some of $he trickery that was going on here. However, there is no doubt that Mulla Salih has always publicl/ and privately declared his pro-British sentiments both from the st rt of the war and before it during the time that he was in the service of Sir Mubarak. In this he has rendered us no small ser vice and I think on the whole th&amp;t hla services outweigh his de linquencies (or I should say perhaps his falling away from the standard which we should have liked to see reached by one who professed to be so ardent a supporter). £-tbruar.v 1 &amp;th- Messrs. Lester James and Halse, geologists, arriv- -ed by 'Maahona'. They intend surveying the country behind Kathi- •ma and later Burgan. February 10th- The Shaikh of Mohammerah called to say goodbye, as he is returning Home after his visit of condolence. He is, I am sure, secretly chagrined by the effect of the chnages Shaikh Salim has introduced in the Pllace. It will be remembered that His Excellency recently married the Georgian widow of^the late Shaikh ,VShaikh Sir Mubarak, and thoraby obtained a footing in tha house-^— hold; Shaikh Salia at once separated the establisiimento and cut &amp; connection which had been the c&amp;uce of a £ood deal of loose-liT- “in^ and some scandval. The Shaikh of Moh ^amerah will perhaps be more affected personally than almost any one by the change of Shaikhs. But d mning with excessive praise is probably the line he will take. He is much feared and disliked here. February l?th. Took the geologists to Kathima by launch and set- tied them down in their first camp. ^ Shaikh Kh&amp;s&amp;al sailed for Mohamraerah. February i.vth &gt; Captain Goldsmith, Assistant Political Officer, Zobeir, arrived overland - was able to Inform him of the version, which reached Kuwait, regarding the split between Dhari bin Towa* -la and Ibn Subhan. It was slid that a man of Dharl’s had killed one of Ibn Subhan*s and that the former had refused to give satis faction. Dh&amp;ri was expected to go with some of his Shaikhs to Bln Saud but the bulk of the Aslaa section would return to Jebel Sha®- -»ar, leaving Ibn Subhan with only a small following. It was further reported that the Dhaffir were splitting up and that the Bidur were in the bad books of Government and had been^ordered to surrender the arms given them. ; * j Lleut-Colonel., Political Agent, Kuwaitx J olitioal Agonoj, a?

Shaikh Salim i*? slightly younger than late Jabir and a'ed about 55. He is regarded as a much stronger character than Jabir and during his father*e lifetime had charge of tribal matters while Jabir who was amiable weak character and bonviveur was Deputy Governor in Koweit.Salim always commanded tribal expeditions on behalf of his father and consequently has strong influence among tribal elements; it was Qxnected that on death of Mubarak he night make a bid for succession but owing his absence in desert and to nresence of warship he waswas faced with fait accompli and accepted Jabir loyally and with good grace and assisted him witri the administration.Owing to his xiedouin training he was formerly believed to be somewhat anti foreign and bigoted but there has been no sign of this since he camo in touch and at Durbar in November he cordially associated himself with all utterances of the three chiefs, de has formally expressed his firm intention of following his father’s policy of loyalty to his attachment to us and pending confirmation of .h's Government has been accented as successor.
