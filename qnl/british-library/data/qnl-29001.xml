Muscat to His Highness at Salalah, refers) was date-stamped 1945 and that he considers it must have deteriorated through age. 2. I inflormed him that in the case of .303 rifle ammunition, in contrast to artillery shells, an aee of three years meant very little, particularly as this particular consign ment had been stored in a cool climate. The Gunnery Officer of H.M.S. Wren supported my view. 3. The Sultan still wishes me to pass on his complaint to the Political Resident with the request that further consignments v under the Air Agreement should be of a more recent manufacture. 4. I would suggest that there might be little chance of his being supplied with newer ammunition as long as the present war-time stocks remain, and there would seem to be little point in pursuing the matter further.

Sq Yonr letter Ext.500l/47 of January 1 st to Ratcliffe Cou sins N ^ about 'authorisation fees' charged by the Egyptians and elsewhere ^ias only just been passed on to me for reply. I much regret the delay. I think the best thing is to give you some idea of recent developments with regard to those fees - and to the best of our knowledge Egypt is the only State still to make such a charge. As you know, the Egyptians used to charge a fee of £1 13 s. 4 d. for the issue of a permit for non-scheduled aircraft (not for the regular airlines) on every occasion when they wished to visit Egypt. The final sentence of Article 15 of the Chicago Convention prohibits such a fee solely in respect of the right of transit over, entry into or exit from the territory of a contracting State, sind partly as a result of our representations, the Egyptians abolished the requirement for a permit, and consequently the fee,where non-traffic flights were concerned. I attach three copies of Egyptian Notice to Airmen No. 9-^ of October, 1947 announcing this step in the right direction. Now, although the Egyptians are strictly entitled under Article 5 of the Convention to levy such a fee when the flight is for traffic purposes, as a 'regulation, condition or limitation', this is contrary to the spirit of I.C.A.O. , which is / aiming E.A.K. Harrison, Esq., Commonwealth Relations Office, Downing Street, London, S.W. t FIL COPYaiming at removing ail hindrances of the kind to free Inter- ^ national flying. Seeing therefore that the Egyptians are apparently the only people to levy such a charge even for traffic flights, we have instructed our representative in Cairo to press for its abolition, as being contrary to the spirit of the Convention and out of step with practice in other member States. Our latest infomation from him leads us to believe that the Egyptians agree that they are wrong to make such a charge and are on the point of issuing instructions to their Consulates abroad to cease levying charges on all entry permits, though this has not yet been done. You will therefore presumably agree that the Political Resident should be informed of these facts, and you may think that in the circumstances it would be a retrograde step if the Sultan of Muscat were to be encouraged to make any charge for 'authorisation* or 'permission' to fly to or through his territory. If there is any other infomation you require, please do not hesitate to let me know.

Dear Harrison, ■XE&amp; MINISTRY OF CIVIL AVIATION, ARIEL HOUSE, STRAND, LONDON, W.C.2. 5th February, 1948« Thank you for your letter of t-he 3 rd February ( Hxt. 293 / 48 ), with which you enclosed a copy of a letter from the Political Resident, Persian G-ulf, referring to the statement made by Mr# Hampton that B.O.A.C# were about to start a landplane service to Australia and the Far East calling at Masirah Island. 2 * I think Hampton has got hold of the wrong end of the stick. It is true that several years ago a service between tne U.K. and Australia was planned to operate London—Lydda— Masirah-Ceylon-Singapore-Darwin-Sydney-Auckland. This, hov^ver, was a very long term project which is unlikely to materialise for some time to come, if at all. 3* B.O.A.C. have, however, recently suggested that they should operate their Bombay terminating service through Masirah, so as to avoid calling en route^Karachi. The proposal was considered here and, in view of the very considerable cost involved since Masirah would be required only for a short period until longer range aircraft were available, it has been decided to drop the idea. Instead of Masirah, B.O.A.C. are now considering routeing the Bombay tenninating service through Dhahran which, although not so good as Masirah from the stage distance point of view, would serve the purpose at mu* 4 . less cost. 4« I am sending copies of this letter to Low at the Air Ministry and Pyman at the Foreign Office.

The vehicles are required in Muscat and the Sultan would like them crated,but if the cost of crating is likely to increase cost appreciably he has requested to be informed of crating charges. In the e/ent of either type of vehicle being acceptable could you kindly undertake the crating and despatch, and, if so, what would the cost of crating be? 6. i e regret having to trouble you with this problem but unless British vehicles can be provided from the U.K.. , li.M.G. must provide sufficient dollars for their purchase froift America, and this the Treasury definitely do not wish to dol We should, therefore, be rateful for your help in providing the above details as early as possible.

The position is that no nanufacture is at present taking place in this country of any 4x4 vehicles of a suitable type and all that could be offered would be 4x2 civilian type vehicles approximately equal in size to the military 30-cwt. These 4x2 vehicles, details of which are shown on the attached, have a very poor cross country performance as compared with the 4x4 types. k You will no doubt wish to consider whether 4x2 vehicles should be offered to the Sultan. The alternative would be to make representations to the War Office or Air Ministry with a view to their releasing 5 4x4 vehicles from their stocks. With regard to the question of civilian type vehicles, it is thought that those mentioned on the attached would be suitable to bring to the notice of the Sultan. We are endeavouring to obtain literature giving fuller details from the firms concerned and will pass it on to you as soon as it is received. You will see that the prices .quoted are ex-v/orks (you will no doubt be in a better position than us to estimate shipping costs to Muscat) and are those normally charged to civilian buyers in this country. Should the five vehicles necessary to meet the treaty obligations be purchased by this Ministry on behalf of the Sultan, the price would probably F.A.K.

The position is briefly that, in connection with the negotiation of a Civil Air Agreement with Muscat in April this year, the Sultan asked, as one condition to his signing the agreement, for 20,000 dollars to purchase from America • f yyn** motor veliieles* required for the Muscat Ini antry. The Treasury were very averse to supplying the dollars and t'.ia Sultan was persuaded to agree to forego tls request for dollars if motor vehicles of the kind required fjould be obtained ..it iin a reasonable time and at a reasonable price frow British sources. The Sultan was then sent epecifioatiena of various military tTP® lorries which we were tinder the impression (wrongly, as it turned out) would be available for supply to him. Prom these specifications the Sultan onose 5 30 owt. Ford W.0.T.S 4*4 G.S. lorries of which two were to be fitted with seats on the same lines as the standard troop carrying lorry Bedford 3 ton 4 * 4, type Since thejjar Office have now confirmed that no military pattern 30 o d,. ua „ - are available from W. IX sources, the only thing tod© seams to be to supply the Sultan with civilian pattern 30 cwt. vehicles of a similar type modified to meet the service requirements embodied in the military pattern vehicles. j.Coombes.

The Treasuiy, however, are not inclined to authorise the appointments at this stage and prefer that the matter should be referred to them at a later date when the posts have to be filled. We feel that we cannot object to the Treasury attitude end we therefore propose to take no further -action for the time being. We suggest, however, that you should arrange for us to be informed if and when it is felt that the time has arrived for appointments to be made. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Air Ministry. Yours sincerely. ^ 1 r -1 /-V V''.

I have written to the Air Ministry asking for con firmation that that Department is willing to bear the expenditure involved and as soon as a reply is received the next step will be to obtain Treasury sanction for the appointments. The salary scale we suggest is £700 x 25 - 900 a year (consolidated) plus foreign service allowance of £300 for a single man and £390 for a married man. It is assumed that the R.A.F.will provide living accommodation and messing, charging the officers an appropriate amount for these facilities. When Treasury approval has been obtained for the appointments we propose to call for volunteers from among our Airport Managers and Air Traffic Control /Officers r F.A.K. Harrison, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.r \ i 1 Officers, If there are no volunteers we then propose to offer appointments to some of the candidates on our lengthy waiting lists of applicants for employment. We suggest offering a contract of 18 months duration. If you have any comments on these proposals, perhaps you would be good enough to let me know. Otherwise we shall keep you informed of developments in due course. Yours sincerely, Establishment DivisionTel.

Muscat on the successful conclusion of the negotiation with the Sultan of Muscat of the Civil Air Agreement, The negotiations have not been inordinately protracted: the actual definitive negotiations began in March, but, the first definite ’’approach” was early in December last: but before that ihere was a great deal of discussion between the Departments of H.M, G, concerned and between them and the Persian Gulf officers. Not only they - on whom of course fall the duty of actually conducting the negotiations, and particularly on Major Stewar|', the P.A, Muscat - but also External Department and Mr .Harrison particularly, have done a good piece of work, which may prove of considerabi value in the new order of things in the Indian Ocean area. I do not think that the Secretary of State need trouble to read any of the papers; but he should be aware of what has been achieved. D. T.M. 11.6.1947Telephone : AIR MINISTRY. LONDON, S.W.l ©.

As regards the appointment of a Civil Superintendent for each of the two aerodromes, I am passing txiis to Major Jones, who will doubtless write to you about it in due course. A.K.

F. Letter No. C.213-2/40 dated the’5th April 1947 from the Political Agent to the Sultan concerning the special rules to be observed by R.A.F. personnel and the crews and passengers of civil aircraft at Sal&amp;lah and Masirah. G. Letter No. C.214-2/40 dated the 5th April 1947 from the Political Agent to the Sultan conveying assurances on a number of points raised by the Sultan. 2. ' The contents of these documents have been discussed in detail with you during the last few months and for the most part agreed and I only propose to comment on a few outstanding pdints. 3. Appendix A. The Muscat Civil Air Agreement. Article 2. With regard [to the question of quarantine^ , i vide paragraph 2(a) of your telegram No. 4208 dated the 30th UfJ March 1947 the Sultan has left it to taF toHmsdce such arrange- ' ments as may be necessary until he can appoint his own quarantine officer, and has not raised again the question of , our paying for such an officer when appointed (c.f. paragraph 3 'flJ&amp;llfL My Express Letter N o. 1188-S dated the 2 3 rd December 1946) . I did not have an oppoftunXty of 'discussing quarantine arrangements with the Air Officer Cominanding Aden but do not consider the matter of immediate importance as no civil aircraft are using the Salalah and Masirah aerodromes at * ‘ / present His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, The India Office, U&gt;HD0if.i \; - 2 - * 'CssSn y &lt;JS3‘ l h Uiju') present nor appear likely to do so in the near future* It vill he time enough to consider what action should be taken when the use of this route by a scheduled service is author ised by the Sultan. Meanwhile the R.A#F. will no doubt take adequate precautions from the point of view of the safety of their own personnel, and the Air Officer Commanding Aden has in fact agreed that the Sultan may be given an assurance that R.A.E. personnel coming from a yellow fever area will be inoculated and that the interior of planes will be sprayed with an insecticide before landing. Article 4. It will be seen that the Sultan has accepted the wording proposed in paragraph 4 of your telegram No.4208 dated the 30th March 1947. Article 6. The Sultan has not objected to the last eighteen words of this Article (c.f. paragraph 5(l) of your telegram No. 4208 dated the 50th March 1947), and they have been allowed to stand. Article 15. A further attempt was made to persuade the Sultan to agree to a refund of duty on fuel and oil (vide paragraph bfiii) of your telegram No. 4208 dated the 30th March 1947) but he refused to concede Tihe point. I considered it undesirable to exert too much pressure seeing that the duty on petrol is only 2 annas a gallon, the route is likely to be very little used by civil aircraft and the trouble involved in working out the amounts to be refunded quarterly and in effecting recovery would not be worth the result likely to be obtained. Major Stewart under my instructions suggested to the Sultan the inclusion in the Agreement of an Article on the lines of Article 3(3) of the 1939 Treaty ensuring most favoured nation treatment for our aircraft in all respects but the Sultan contended that such a provision would only be appropriate in a treaty and not in an ordinary agreement such as we were negotiating and showed such obvious distress at this eleventh hour proposal that I did not press it. He did definitely state that if he granted a concession in respect of customs duties to any other party he would extend it to us; in fact he went so far as to say that he would never show anybody more favour than his *old friends the British'. I did not ask him for any written assurance to this effect as it appeared to me that so far as customs duties axe concerned our position is adequately safeguarded by Article 3(2) of the 1939 Treaty. Article 16. As the Sultan has not insisted on the payment of the old war subsidy up to the time of the signing of the Agretmient the new subsidy is due from the 1st January iyi 1947 as agreed to in paragraph 2(d) of your telegram No.2609 31^/47 dated the 26th Febru a ry 19 47The Sultan has asked that the 'Subsidy'should be paid to his credit with Messrs* Lloyds Bank Limited, London in sterling half-yearly under intimation to him. He has an account at present with Messrs. Lloyds Bank Bombay but none with any of their London offices. I would suggest that the first six-monthly instalment of the new subsidy should be remitted to the head office of the Bank in London and that they should be asked to place the money to the Sultan*s credit and to open an aaccount in his favour in direct communication with him, and that subsequent instalments should be paid six-monthly in advance on the 1st January and 1st July each year, beginning with the 1st July 1947. / Article 17 ./ 5.

T/223 dated 5th Anril 1947. The Sultan asked for l^^OOOdoTlarsto en1SuhiS'to purchase some motor vehicles required for the Muscat Infantry and an agricultural tractor from America. He has agreed to forego his request for dollars if motor vehicles of the kind required can he obtained within a reasonable time and at a reasonable price from British sources. I should he grateful if you could kindly supply me as soon as possible with specifications and prices of British made 30 cwt. and 3 ton troop-carrying lorries and agricultural tractors or advise me of any department or organisation to which I might apply direct for such particulars. 10. The Sultan did not ask whether we would he willing to provide increased facilities at Salalah and Masirah should civil air traffic require them c.f. paragraph 3 of my telegram No. T/37 dat e d 10th March 1947 and was not there fore told that there would he no objection to foreign air lines which used these aerodromes regularly providing their own special facilities c.f. paragraph 8 of your telegram Ngu 4208 dated 30th March 1947^. 11. The negotiations with the Sultan for civil and H.A.P. air facilities have been conducted throughout by Major Stewart with very little intervention by myself. He had to embark on them at the beginning of December as soon as he took over as Political Agent and for three weeks then at Muscat and for four weeks later at SAlalah he spent several hours almost every day in discussions with His Highnes wlx) has expressed his appreciation of the patience, courtesy and ability shown by him. I consider it entirely due to Major Stewart*s tact and perseverance that the figure for the subsidy has been kept as low as £6,000 and I trust that His Majesty** Government will agree that the results of the negotiations are satisfactory and that he is to he con gratulated on the success of his efforts. Major Stewart reports that the Sultan oh his side has been charming to deal with. IThile jealous of his position as an independent sovereign and suspicious of every alteration suggested he has on the whole been extremely reasonable and genuinely anxious to reach an agreement satisfactory to both parties. Apart from the time spent in discussions he has devoted many hours to the study of the various documents and has more than onoe rather pathetically complained that he has had to strive unaided with the united brains of the India Office, / the6 • the Goyernment of India* the Political Resident and the Political Agent. We are indeed fortunate in having in him an enlightened Ruler who relies on his own intelligence and is swayed by no aelf-seeking counsellors or favourites* 12.

Copy forwarded with compliments to - His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, The India Office, LONDON . with reference to India Office telegram No. 2612 dated 26th February 1947.secr et. No.C 204-2/40 F7 POLITICAL AGENCY, MUSCAT, / ^ | i (camp) Salalah, ' Dated 21st March , 1947. Derr Colonel Hay, I arrived in Salalah on the 14th of March and comraenced dis cussions with the Sultan on the basis of the drafts forwarded to the India Office with your Express Letter No.ll72-S, dated the 19th De cember, 1946, amended so as to incorporate additions and alterations proposed up to the receipt of India Office telegram No.3153, dated the 8th March , 1947. After five days of almost continuous discussions with the Sultan, he has agreed to accept the draft forms of agreement which I enclose with this letter. For facility of reference I attach Appendix •A* showing (a) the amendments made from time to time in accordance with instructions received from you and the India Office and (b) the amendments and additions Insisted upon by the Sultan in our present discussions. I have disputed for many hours the amend ments proposed by the Sultan and the ones now incorporated in the draft attached are those on which I have not been able to persuade him to give say. There were many other amendments he wished to make which he has finally conceded to me in our discussions. I do not feel that I should have any success in disputing the remaining points on which he now insists and in view of the fact that he is granting to us all our demands for pounds sterling 6000, I recommend that these amendments and the a dditional assurances enumerated in para 2 below should be conceded. 2. The Sultan raised the following new points in our discussions! (a) He wished assurances that if the numbers of Royal Air Force personnel permanent and in transit are to be increased as proposed, there should always be reasonably senior officers in charge of the bases at Masirah and Salalah and that these officers should each be provided with an efficient interpreter. (b) He stipulated that the camp area in Salalah should for purpose oi its own security be enclosed in wire fence. (c) After the expiry of the agreement, all permanent buildings should revert to the Sultan free of charge. (d) Buildings will be maintained in reasonable condition by the ^oyal Air Force. (e) As long as Masirah is maintained, we will agree to main tain at least minimum facilities at Salalah. (f) Numbers of R.A.F. personnel visiting the town and basaar areas at any one time shall be restricted. (g) In each of the seven years dT the Agreement, the Sultan shall be supplied with 10,000 rounds S.A.A. on payment. (h) As Masirah develops, it will be necessary for the Sultan (both in his interest and ours) to send a representAtive for periodic inspection of the island. The Royal Air Force should whenever pos sible supply transport. to The Hon'ble Lt. Col. W.R. Bay, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN. /'-S7 - 2 - 1 n o J -i O (tfj) \ (i) All Royal Alp Force stores etc., though exempt from payment of customs duty, should, in accordance with Article 5 (5) of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and MarlgatIon, signed at Muscat on the 5th February, 1939, comply with customs formalities• 3. I was not able to obtain the Sultan's consent to a revision of the rents after 12 to 18 months In the light of the buildings actually required by us (vide paragraph 3 of India Office telegram No.3028, dated the 6th Iferch, 1947;. Since, however, we have now obtained his agreement to grant to us not only all the buildings, but also our Increased requirements for the sum of pounds sterling 6000 only, which, you will remember, was the sum he originally de manded for our lesser requirements In addition to rents for the American bungalows, I have not felt It possible to pursue this point. The Sultan has moreover made it quite dear that if there Is to be any re-negotiation after 12 or 18 months, it will be for the entire agreement. I trust you will agree that this point should be dropped. 4. Regarding the method of payment to be made. If the subsidy Is to be regarded entirely in the light of payment for rents of buildings, it will be necessary to Insert a new paragraph in the letter covering the Royal Air Force requirements and omit Article 16 In the Civil Air Agreement. The Sultan appears to be content to leave this to our discretion. I should accordingly be glad for Instructions on this point. 5* I conveyed to the Sultan the conditions as laid down in para graph 2 of India Office telegram No.2609, dated the 26th February, 1947, under which we are prepared to operate the Civil Air Agreement. The Sultan took immediate objection to my use of the words 'minimum' and 'limited' (your telegram No.T/ 37, dated the 11th Iferch, 1947, refers). I had in any case not put these conditions In writing, so did not press the point. I should be glad to be Informed however whether these conditions should be made In writing. If so, I think they can without difficulty be incorporated in the separate letter covering the Sultan's points (Appendix 'H* of your Express Letter No.U72-S, dated the 19th Decomber, 1946). I think It should be borne In mind however that the Sultan will not agree to the Inclusion of the words 'minimum' and 'limited' nor do I, In fact, ayself feel that they serve any useful purpose, since without precise definition } for the use of such terms must always leave room for argument*. 6. The Sultan (In view of para 2 (c) of the Royal Air Force letter, as amended) drove around the aerodrome with eyself and the Air Officer Coarxndlng In order to nark on a map the limits of what he considered to be the present boundaries of the aerodrome. It Is apparent, that If the stage Is ever reached when there will be 500 Royal Air Force Personnel permanently stationed at Salalah together with 500 In transit, there must be fairly considerable new construction, the Air Officer Commanding and nyaelf accordingly endeavoured to stretch these boundaries as widely a a possible so as to leave room for new construction. We finally oame to an agreement which would In the opinion of the Air Officer Commanding and ^rself leave room within the Halts of the aerodrome for all additional construction that we could at the present time foresee. Sinoe to obtain extra land, which way,in fact, never actually be required, would only have resulted In an immediate increase in the sum of pounds sterling 6000 demanded by the Sultan, we felt that no useful purpose would be served by pressing for wider-llmits at this stage. If and when extra land Is required, it can under Article 2 (d) of Royal Air Force letter be negotiated on payment of additional rent at the time.13 -3 8. Regarding the Sultan's points (Appendix 'H' of your Express Letter No.1172-3, dated the 19th December, 1946), the first point Is settled since for the sun of pounds sterling 6000 we get all rights In all buildings. It Is however open for consideration by us as to what proportion of the B.O.A.C. buildings apart froa the beach camp, which la not Included In the agreenent, should be mde available by the Royal Air Force for the use of civil airways and the civil airways superintendent. Point 2. This will, I think, hove to be conceded. Points 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and U, can without difficulty be conceded. Point 14* The Sultan merely wishes to stipulate that the graves of all Christians who may have the misfortune to die or be killed at Salalah shall be concentrated In one cemetery and not scattered about. Point 15. The Sultan drops this. Point 16. Provision has been made In the plan of the aerodrome for a single petrol dump. Points 17, 18, 19 and 20 are covered. Point 21. No longer arise. 9. It has been agreed vide India Office telegram No.1078, dated the 23rd January, 1947, that It shall be left to your discretion to draw up with the Air Officer Coanandlng rules for the conduct and security of Royal Air Force personnel. The Air Officer Commanding sees no objection to the rules proposed in your Appendix G, and I will draft for your approval a separate letter conveying our agree ment to these rules to the Sultan. 10. The Sultan also asks for a separate letter from you or from me conveying our agreement to his points mentioned In Appendix 'H* together with the new points now raised. 11. Regarding the number of Askars, It transpired that,in addition to the 80 the Sultan required for the camp, there are also 6 Askars employed as guards at Rlsut, the place where Royal Air Force land stores shipped by sea making a total of 86 in all. The Air Officer Commanding and nyself discussed this question with the Sultan. I was personally of the opinion that there is much to be said In favour of the Sultan's arguments for an increase in the number from 60 to 80 and the Air Officer Commanding finally also agreed. 12. If the points now raised with new additions and amendments proposed by the Sultan are acceptable to His Majesty's Govemraent, I see no reason why the agreement and letters should not be signed and the negotiations completed during your visit to Salalah between the 3rd and 6th of April. n o 7. Regarding rules for the conduct and security of Royal Air Force personnel (Appendix G of your Express Letter No.U72-S, dated the 19th December, 1946), the Air Officer Commanding agrees to all the conditions Including the new Article 10 which the Sultan requires to be amended to read as followst 'The Agent appointed to procure local food supplies Including firewood should, as at present, be appointed by the Sultan.'•4 EXT 7 o .1 13. I am sending this letter through the good offices of the Air Officer Commanding. It seems unlikely however that it can arrive at Bahrain before the 27th or 28th of March. In order therefore to save time and to facilitate references you may have to make to the India Office, I am forwarding a copy together with its enclosures direct to Donaldson. I am also forwarding to you but not to the India Office post copies of my telegrams issued from Salalah up to date, so that any mutilations in transit of the originals can be corrected.

If payment is to be made (group corrupt) in terms of rent then Article 16 of Agreement. (Article 17 cf Appendix A) will have to be omitted and fresh sentence inserted in R.A.F. letter. Trust it may be left to my discretion to arrange this.. (b) A.0.C* suggests mhat it may well be desirable to develop aerodrome at Has al Habd or $£uscat. If this is so, I think there is suitable site within the vicinity of Muscat and if I am given discretion I think I could, if done now, get Sultan’s agreement tc examine site for flying by our suggesting that we do /thisINWARD TELEGRAM this ex g yatia for favours received at Sal and Masirah.

It also transpires that there ere 6 new doing guard duty at pi. oe where cargo shipped by sea is landed, making total 86 .

No. TEMPLfe BAR 2466, Ext. REF: R.5806A5 ARIEL HOUSE, STRAND, LONDON, W.C.2. -yj March, 1947* Dear Donaldson, Owing to repeated changes in policy regarding Muscat a large nuoiber of papers have accummulated on which you will . be expecting comments, and the best course appears to be to begin again at the point where we dropped considering the proposed civil agreement when it was decided to have an air force agreement only. 2. - At that point we were considering your letter no. EXT.b60l/45 of the 2nd January, 1947 and the comprehensive enclosures from the Political Resident, our comments on this are as follows: - ' A 1 Appendix (A) Heads of Agreement. (i) Article 4. The redraft of this Article is not objectionable but it may be noted that it J makes no provision at all for authorising comm- » ercial flights other than scheduled services. The Sultan has apparently designed to incorporate the first part of Article 5* °f ^ ie Chicago Convention but has left out the second part. Some provision will have to be made for commercial charter flights, and since the Sultan will probably see in them a chance for making money he, presumably, wisnes to retain for himself the right to authorise them. /(ii)... E.P. Donaldson, Esq., India Office, King Charles Street, London, S•W•1•(ii) Article 6 . If the Sultan chooses to cut out the words 'subject to such amendments as may from * time to time be agreed by the parties to this agreement' we should not object, but we should prefer the Article to remain as it stands. Agreement could be effected by an Exchange of Notes as su gg ested by Colonel liay* (iii) Article 9. The words 'by them' k*n the fourth line appear to be unnecessary and should be omitted. (iv) Article 15. It seems to be the general opinion that we should press for the exemption from customs duty fuel and oil taken on board an aircraft for use during flight. The matter is not of great importance to this Ministry since we are not contemplating operating any civil services through Muscat territory, but it is apparently of importance to India, and will also be of great importance to the R.A.P. should their scale of operations through the territory be considerable. In any case we think we should press, at least y for the inclusion of a most favoured nation clause. (v) Article 17. This is now a matter which concerns the Air Ministry only. We are interested only in Salaha, and G-uadur the airfields mentioned in schedule two, and of these the only civil interest lies in the possible need to use the marine base facilities at Guadur for our flying boat service. (vi) Article 18. This as framed frustrates our * intention of getting a seven year agreement without any risk of the financial side being reopened. If the * financial terms are to be reviewed after three years, there would not from our point, of view be any advantage in extending its term beyond that period. The Air Ministry, however, may wish to secure a longer tenure. /’B*.... u*, B f Appendix (b) Air Navigat ion Regulations. The following are our only comments to these:- (i) Rule 1. The Sultan's desire for money is brought out*by his insistence in placing this provision prominently at the head of the Regulations, although, it might be more appropriately in the body of the Heads of Agreement. ... However, we do not object to leaving it where it is or -fothe proposed addition to the Rule which is mentioned in Political. Resident's letter No. II 08 -S 6 f the 23rd December. The word 'an' before 'aircraft' should, however, be omitted. In accordance with international practice it would be more normal for such applications to e made at the diplomatic level, but probably tne Sultan feels that he will get more by dealing direct with the airline operators. * x 'iC' 0 - .« (li) Rule 13% We have no objection to the Editions to this clause or to the addition proposed in the Political Resident's letter No.lloo-S. ?e would, however, suggest that the words as far as may be appropriate' should be added at the end ot the addition. (iii) Rule 14. We see no objection in principle to this Rule, but are in doubt as to ,the author! y that is to enforce the Rule and impose^penalty. Presumably, some-body would have to prosecution in some court which not only has juris diction to hear and determine the case but also nnwfir to enforce its decision. /'O'...t C t Appendix (C) General Conditions for Use of Aerodromes * jJThere have been ylrthe Sultan that the !*ee of £62 for the The only reference we (i) Rule 1. We agree to the amendments suggested by the Political Agent in his, letter and also in the telegram No. 275 (paragraph 5 ). Otherwise we have no comments on Appendix VC* • 'D* Appendices (D.E.g and G) Appear to concern the Z Z- Ministry only, and we have no comments to offer. b \sJC t E t Appendix fH} Points to-he forwarded by the Sultan . We agree generally with the Political Residents comments, and the only points needing notice are:- (i) Point 13 Authorising J^e, several references to Egyptian Government realise^ a authorising of each aircraft,. can find is in paragraph 1 of Clause 0 of the Egyptian Air Navigation*Regulations, 1939&gt; which states that the authorising^fee for foreign aircraft is 62 Piastres . This is merely a registration fee equivalent to about 13 s. 2 +d. and intended, presumably, to cover the cost of the office staff and stationery etc., involved in the issue of the appropriate papers. Possibly when the Sultan realises this he will not wish to proceed any further, but should he still wish to do so it may be pointed out that this fee is in any event in respect of an°a«^®^authorisi«g, and not one to be collected for each particular flight. (ii) Point 21. I think we have already agreed^ that we are not interested in maintaining any airfields except those listed in schedule 2 of the Agreement, and that should the Americans for exai^le wish to construct an airfield of their own at Shinas we should have no objection. A..../ 7 .... 3 . 13 Political Resident's telegram No. 258 of 1st i,larch:- • v * 1 (i) Paragraph 2(A). We should agree to the proposed amendment to Article 1, but xt xs really more a point for the Air Ministry. (ii) Paragraph 2(B). We should prefer that Article W should run 'His Majesty's Government is authorised to grant on behalf of the Sultan the right to land at the airfields mentioned in schedule 2 for non-traffic pruposes or to make flights acioss I his territories to all aircraft not engaged in : scheduled international services?(Para 2(A) above ; also refers). .

C.30350/S.6 26 th March, 1947 Dear Harrison, Please refer to your letter the 15th March about the Political Residents ruery in his telegram T/37 of the 11th March. There is no doubt that if Masirah and Salalah are developed as staging posts^increased facilities, particularly signals facilities, will become available for use by civil air traffic without necessitating an increase of R.A*P* staff. We are naturally reluctant, hov/ever, to commit ourselves to the full provision of civil facilities. Prom a strictly R.A^P. point of view, I do not think we would wish to insist on the exclusive character of the agreement, and we would be prepared to agree that foreign airlines which use the route regularly should provide their own facilities. Perhaps the Ministry of Civil Aviation can advise further on this point. I am sending copies of this letter to the recipients of yours. Yours sincerely. (M.W- LOW) F. A. K.

Dear Harrison, I have just seen Telegram No. 275 of the 4th March from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf about the Muscat Oivil Air Agreement, which deals inter alia with the question of the refund of duty on aviation fuel and oil. ^ i • I am not clear whether duty is paid on P,0. L. imported for R.A.F. purposes: but, if it is, the amount at stake will be far from negligible if the developments foreshadowed in Low's letter to you of the 4th March materialise.

Admittedly, our bargaining position would seem to br rather weak; but neverthe less I feel we should not give way on the point without some effort to obtain a quid pro quo. A possible solution may be that, in view of the e.&gt;g*1lh the Air JHnistry's requirements which is dealt with in IjOw's letter to Harrison of the 4th Merch, we will wish to retain for R.A.F. use all the available buildings at Salal&amp;h. If this should prove to be the case, the Sultan clearly cannot expect us to hand the buildings over to him, and it should be possible to provide for their retention, together with that of all the other buildings at iiasirah and Salalah, when settling the overall annual subsidy which the Sultan is to receive under the Muscat Air Agreement. 1 am copying this letter to Harrison and Low.

At an Interdepartmental. Meeting which was subsequently held the Ministry of Civil Aviation^and other Departments,*agreed to the negotiations for a Civil Air Agreement (which inter alia was to provide a cover for the R.A.P. requirements) going ahead and said that they would provide a Civil Superintendent at Masirah and Salad ah to run the aerodromes for the Sultan and administer his Air Navigation Regulations for him. This was conveyed to the Political Resident in India Office telegram No. 2609 of 26th February. The Air Ministry indicated at the Meeting that they might shortly be asking us to obtain from the Sultan facilities for the R.A.F on a substantially higher scale than those which they had previously asked for (as given in the draft letter flagged at Appendix D to the Political Residents letter of 19th December). The Air Ministry have now communicated their increased requirements in their letter of 4th March below. It will be seen that they now want to provide for Masirah to be raised to a full scale trunk route staging post on the Middle East and Fax East route and for Salalah to be made an adversary staging post against the contingency that the R.A.F. may, after June, 1948, be denied the use of staging posts in India. As the Air Ministry remark^,, this meeting lead the Sultan to raise his price above the £6,000 already authorised (particularly in view of the fact that they will now want all the^jfeons true ted buildings which belong to the Sultan) and they nave obtained sanction from the Treasury for the price to be raised to £8,200 if necessary (the Sultan earlier stated that he would want £3,200 for the rent of buildings in addition to £5,000 promised him in respect of our rights under the Civil Air Agreement.) Two draft telegrams to the Political Resident are now submitted. The second telegram which is not being copied to the Government of India gives the background for the R.A.F*s increased requirements.

TMMEDIA'EE AIR MINISTRY, King Charles Street, Whitehall, S.W.1. 4th March, 1947. Dear Harrison, You will recall that at our recent meeting I said that we* were consulting on the practicability of establishing land plane routes for reinforcement and replacement flights between Middle East and A fc C*F*E* via Ceylon and avoiding India» 2. MED-M.E* have now stated that the route via Socotra and Addu Atoll presents serious difficulties in supply and maintenance, and it seems clear that the reinforcement ♦ route to A*C«P.E* may have to be Aden - Masirah - Ceylon, or Bahrein - Masirah - Ceylon. If further surveys which are being made show either of these routes to be practicable and if the future attitude of India compels us to open them up, the establishment of a full scale trunk route staging post at Masirah, and possibly a staging- post for diversionary purposes at Salalah, may become necessary. This will necessitate a revision of our&gt; stated require ments at these places. , 3. Our revised requirements^ would be as follows:- r~ I (a) The' right to land aircraft in transit at Masirah and Salalah* &lt; &lt; (b) • The right to maintain at each airfield a quantity of stores and equipment v/ith which to service &lt;■ aircraft in transit. (c) The right to* station at each airfield up to 500 R-A.F* personnel^ as permanent staff for the purpose of providing for the R*A*F*:- (i*) Servicing and refuelling facilities for aircraft in transit. , ,F*A*K* Harrison, Esq India Office* » /(ii) #••••»signals facilities, (iii) Airfield maintenance and repair» (ii) Air navigation, Flying Control and other^ (d) The right to accommodate temporarily at each airfield up to 500 service passengers and aircrev/ in transit in addition to the permanent staff referred to in para (c) above* (e) The right to maintain at each airfield a small communication flight of not more than 6 aircraft* 4* It is clear that when the Sultah is approached with these increased requirements he may not be satisfied with the offer of £6,000 per annum which the Treasury have agreed should be made to him. Were it not for the complication regarding the buildings, we could say, if he wanted to raise the price, that our original requirements should stand and that we would negotiate again if and’ when the increased requirements materialised. It seems probable, however, that in order to accommodate the greater numbers of personnel contemplated it would be necessary to retain the use of virtually all the R.A.F* and U*S* constructed buildings at Masirah and Salalah; and consequently we must hang on to them in the meanwhile, since the Sultan has expressed his intention of dis mantling those which we do not want. We have therefore agreed with the Treasury that, having regard to the possible new strategic, requirements, negotiations with the Sultan should proceed on the basis of retaining all the buildings at Salalah and Masirah. If, as a result, the Sultan presses for something like the £ 8,200 which he mentioned originally, we would have no alternative but to accent; bu*t, of. .course, if the Political Resident can get what we (f) The right to station Aden Protectorate Levies for guard purposes at Masirah. t #Tel.

We consider, however, chat in view of the uncertainty of the position in regard to our military rights in India after June 1948, we should include a provision for a review of the Agreement on the point of the number of buildings to be retained, after, say, twelve to eighteen months, when the strategic issue should be clearer. 5. We should also like the Agreement to cover the use by the R.A.F. of all airfields in Muscat territory, including Gwadur, even though our specific requirements at this stage relate only to the occupation of Masirah and Salalah. 6 . As regards the number of Askars to be kept at Salalah, I suggest that we adhere to the view,which I note you have already expressed in paragraph 6 of your telegram No.1078 of January 23rd, that we see no necessity to increase their numbers. 7.

This accords with the instructions I have received from you that the Royal Air Force are interested in no landing grounds other than Salalah and Masirah. 2. I have also recently been addressed demi-officially by the External Affairs Department regarding a proposal that the Sultan should be induced to sell Gwadur back to Kalat State. I sent a guarded reply in which I said amongst other things that I presumed His Majesty's Government would be consulted before I was asked to take any definite action. 3. On general grounds there is much to be said in favour of handing back Gwadur to Kalat. The Sultan is an interloper' there and his retention of an enclave in non-Arab territory will tend to become more and more of an anachronism. On the other hand it would appear that it might be of the greatest advantage to us from the point of view of both imperial strategy and air communications to have a pied a terre on the Mekran Coast in the event of India becoming unfriendly or lapsing into a state of chronic disorder. I expect this has already been taken into consideration and that I am merely wasting your time by raising the point but I should be grateful if you could kindly confirm this.

As regards the civil aviation facilities which the Sultan is likely to request to be made available, it is difficult to foresee hew much these will amount B.O.A.C. make no use of the airfields# however presunably be necessax , y at least to make available facilities for irregular charter flights and Indian airlines and perhaps American too (e.g.T.W.A.) who may wish to develop services before long. In any case refuelling /facilitiesj,- .....L ■ ■ 'ic •, jx.t.Ci'ii'f:; rvi i o;’ facilities will have to be provided and administration of the Sultan's Air Navigation Regulations will have to be carried out. X am not sure how far the R. A.P. themselves will be able to provide these requirements. They will arise in any case whether we have a Civil Air Agreement aixejxe an? or not. : 1 £1£ J, In view of these points and the political considerations which are developed^below, we feel that we ought to review the o .rgiintntn r O hi • • ' &gt; . , ; / . ■ • • • ; in favour of proceeding with a Civil Air J - u • • • * 'j_ «-/•' ' Agreement.

I must leave ^psr you to decide the best way of conveying intimation to Sultan in present circumstances.r.fr ♦Donaldson I share the Department's misgivings about this matter. This sudden reversal in the case of the Muscat Air Agreement, taken along with the withdrawal of the flying boat services round the Persian Gulf and the rest of the Middle East, suggests that B.O.A.C. are drawing in their horns as regards regional air services to an extent which is surely undesirable from the political point of view. I shouldn't have thought B.C.A.C. were doing this of their own accord, and I suspect they are under pressure from the Ministry of Civil Aviation, and of course, in the background, the Treasury. In other words, it may be that too mercantile a view is being taken of the matter and financial factors need to be counterbalanced by pressure from the political side. I think, therefore, that we should weigh in, but I daresay this will not have much effect unless we can get the Foreign Office in with us. Is not this just one of those matters that might be dealt with by the Middle last Committee if it were functioning? I think you might find .Oreenhill of some service in this connection. He has lately returned from Cairo. We are rather in the dark about the whole business. But my guess would be that B.O.A.C. and the Ministry^ 1 . Civil Aviation are not interested on a long view w44^xhe regional services, but are concerned primarily with the long distance through route services . Their policy is to leave the regional services to the civil aviation concerns of the countries en route, and they are only interested to the extent that they may be associated with local aviation companies as the B.O.A.C. is to be associated with the Egyptians in the Anglo-Igyptian Air Corporation (or whatever its title is). This Anglo-E&amp;yptian concern when it gets /goinggoing mi^at easily run a service from Cairo to Karachi qnrj thus meet the needs of the Gulf, and we should have a hand in it through B.OJUC.'s half share. Similarly, a service with like facilities might be based upon India. The trouble is that it will be some time before regional organisations can really play an active role. Meanwhile, it appears that we, that is the Ministry of Civil Aviation and B.O.A.C., are stepping out of the field , prematurely and leaving a void. This, I should have thought, is very bad for our prestige as well as being highly inconvenient for our official and business interests in the area, and it diminishes the goodwill which we should like to hand over to our successors in the field such as Egyptian and Indian concerns which may run services in the Middle East. 4.2 47Under Secretary of State . ✓ Muscat Civil Air Agreement * These papers were last submitted to you at EXT.4012/46 where the instructions to the Political Resident to proceed to negotiate a civil air agreement with the Sultan were under consideration. The Political Resident duly proceeded to enter into negotiations and these had reached an advanced stage when the Political Resident in his Express Letter of 19th December submitted for H.M.G-'s consideration and approval the various drafts in the form which they had then reached in negotiations with the Sultan. We held an inter-departmental meeting to consider these on 21st January (see Minutes flagged) bombshell was thrown into the proceedings by the Ministry of Civil Aviation announcing that B.O.A.C. had now informed them that they had no civil air r equir ements in Muscat and that negotiations wi%h such an agreement might therefore be terminated. The Air Ministry however continue to need the R.A.F. facilities at Masirah and Salalah which they have asked us to continue to negotiate for. We communicated this to the Political Resident in our telegram No.1078 of the 22nd January and have now received his reply in his telegram No.109 below. It seems clear that the effect on the Sultan of not telling him that the civil air agreement is off would be most unfortunate from the political point of view and will at the same time mean abandoning the position regarding civil aviation that we have obtained in Muscat. B.O.A.C. now say (after changing their mind at least twice) that they can foresee no future requirements in Muscat but I wonder whether they may not want to change their mind again say in two or five years time. It seems to me that with aviation developing so rapidly it is impossible to look ahead so far as this and we ought not to abandon our civil aviation position unless we are absolutely sure that we shall not want it back again. In any case Indian air lines are likely /toto have a requirement in two or three years time. As regards the R.A.F. it will de seen that the Political Resident thinks that the Sultan may want as much for R.A.F. facilities alone as for the whole civil air agreement'and also that he will want the R.A.F. to keep the aerodromes open for civil aviation purposes. As regards the latter point, I understand that the R.A.F. will probably be unable to provide any civil facilities beyond a bare landing ground so that we may not be able to satisfy the Sultan on this point. In the circumstances and particularly in view of the Political Resident’s telegram I think that we ought to get the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Air Ministry and Treasury to consider further whether it would not after all be unwise to abandon the idea of a civil air agreement. Would it not, for example, be possible to continue negotiations for a civil air agreement on the present lines but at the same time to explain frankly to the Sultan that since B.O.A.C. will not want to use the Ja 60 JLL^ Ca*. J-** aerodromefin the future^and we are doubtful whether there will be much requirement from foreign air lines, we do not think it will be an economic proposition for the time being to provide at the airfields special civil facilities beyond those needed by the R.A.F. but that in the event of civil requirements developing in the future we shall provide the if- tA civil facilities required on the Sultan's behalf or terminate the civil aviation agreement], JVe might at the ^ * same time limit our commitments to Masirah and Salalah (and ^ Jw / /G perhaps Gwadur). No doubt the Ministry of Civil Aviation would need some persuading to accept this, particularly if the cost of2 the civil aviation agreement is to go on their yote. But looking at it from a broad point of view is it not worth facilities alone, we preserve our civil aviation position in Muscat and the Sultan's good will. Before the war we used to pay the Sultan an Arms Traffic Subsid^/for which we got nothing except the Sultan’s political goodwill. For a civil air agreement we should be getting both his goodwill and a material advantage. The position will have to be discussed further with the Air Ministry, the Ministry of Civil Aviation and the Treasury, before we send the Political Resident a reply. I suggest that in such a discussion we should take the above line. while? The R.A.F. may have to pay nearly as much for their # / ft till* JG HC ft. J/CX (j-fj C0O* h ^ tyofftA.M.

Time required to open up route to full scale use is based on peak daily aircraft flow through the busiest airfield of ten multi-engined and six twin-engined movements per day as quoted in para 3 of appendix (b) A to your letter C30450 6 th November 46* This may be incorrect assumption but you will be able to adjust requirements for petrol, which is main factor involved if you have different figures for full scale effort* 3* Case A* Worst case as follows. Petrol stocks.at present at Masirah would be exhausted within six days of above full scale use of loute. If order to open route to full scale were given at end of April petrol could not be shipped until end of October. If this delay is unacceptable petrol stocks required to cover the period are estimated as four million gallons* It is also understood that ; t the moment the ^nglo-Iranian Oil Company are unable to guarantee shipment befc re Monsoon sets in of orders placed after February* Worst case would therefore be nine months. 4 . Case 3 as follows. If order to open route were given in September to February, shipment of fuel required could be carried out in two months, subject to availability of shipping. ,.11 other arrangements required t« open up the route could be carried out within the two months required for the shipping of petrol* 5 . Case C. as follows. If it is decided to maintain sufficient stocks of petrol permanently at the throe airfields it would need to be replaced every twelve months, this being the average length of time before it would go off specification. In this case other arrangements required to open up the route could be carried out in the month provided no equipment was required, such as additional transport, which could not be flown in. If any replacement equipment had to go by sec. the time required mifeht be up to two months. Unless the equipment needed consisted of something vital, its provision would, however, be unlikely to affect materially the full scale use of the route. Time of origin 031930Z.

X . ‘ Mr. Rat cl iff e-Cousins said that the Ministry of Civil Aviation now had no requirements at all, since B.O.A.C. had recently informed them that they could not foresee that they would need any facilities at all in Muscat territory and were ready to withdraw at 14 days* notice* There was therefore no need to proceed with the Civil Air Agreement as such. 3 Mr. Low said that” the R;A.F. requirements were unchanged. They wished to maintain airfields at SALALAH and MASIRAH on the present basis as an insurance against any cessation either in peace or war of facilities on the Iraq route to the Far East. The exact scale on which the aerodromes would be maintained had not,however,yet been decided. They would require the majority of the American buildings at these airfields but not the B.0.A.C.buildings. These latter could be handed over to the Sultan, but as no surrender agreement had been made regarding them it might be possible to obtain some quid pro quo. On the minor points, Mr. Low said that A.O.C.Aden considered that there was no need to increase the number of Askars at Salalah, nor the number of points to be guarded. ^ would negotiate rules of conduct personally with the Sultan. The R. A.P. would continue, the facilities regarding the carriage of mail and transmission of messages ^as fa r as possible ) Mr. Fetch sa id that there was no objection to the Sultan* s purchasing arms from The Treasury would, however, be reluctant to release any dollars to the Sultan unless this could not be avoided* With regard to the annual amount to be paid to the Sultan, he thought that in view of the reduced facilities required^any authorit^rto the £3,000.

Reasons for this will be explained in subsequent paragraphs 2. *&gt;3 regards inspection of the tnrae airfields by aircraft fron Iraq before the war this was not done during tno Soutn \Tost Monsoon. This was done by either Vincents, or Valontias. You will adnit t nat, tno so types of aircraft can land in snail spaces 'where it is impossible for b'ollinw-tbns to land. MEllingtons are tno only typo we have, and they must nave runways. In addition .during the.’South 'Vest Monsoon,Salalah is frequently out/of action and an alternative landing ground as necessary when S a la lan is out of action. 30./C .will confirm that during tne South Most Monsoon Salalah if frequently .completely* out of action and at other times report must $6 to the id? and Eureka bo haems. 3. If the airfields are inspected frequently by air using twin engine aircraft (Wellington) as wo must do tnc airfields must (r) must be kept serviceable to the present standards which are already the mininun compatible with safety, Tnesc nirninuin standards are ‘only maintained oven no\/ by constant daily maintenance, work utilising a labour force of 20 men at Riyan and 'Salalah respectively and ^&gt;0 77.cn at Masirah. If tois constant daily maintenance is discontinued for even a minimum period of one month it is nignly probable that tne runways would bo', unsafe for tnc first inspecting aircraft to land and conditions would become progressively more, unsafe .for subsequent inspections. In any event such inspect ons would- nardly service any usdful purpose (crp. grp) as with the cassation of the present minimum maintondneo program 10 the condition to be found on the sites on the occasion of tno very first inspection thereafter could be confidently forecast without undertaking tnc Hazards involved, Sucn conditions would almost certainly warrant the posting of an overhaul works party to the sites within tnreo months ef their evacuation and those parties would nave to be transported by sea and be factod on (crp, grp) with repair programme of formidable proportion. 4. The alternative so far- ao the runways are concerned are quite clear. They must either be maintained by the present standards and subsequently by the present constant attention or be abandoned until tnc route is again required and substantiated report if and when that eventually materialises. / 5 .KX. 57370. (CONtf^O - 2 - 5. As rogards installations if the -water and electrical plant were removed in whole or in part facilities would not exist for the accommodation of working parties as and when these wore sent to the sites under the periodic maintenance scheme visualised. Apart from this the a^;e and general condition of the distillation plants render their dismantling and subsequent re-erection questionable from practical point of view and definitely unsound from an economical aspect further more the temporary facilities originally provided (LST ? S) for the transfer of service equipment from ship to Site jetties because track and temporary access roads arc now either non existent or unserviceable consequently in the event of removal rafts would have to be built. The removal of generating sets of .L.iiter Kb Calibre to __den for storage might be warranted but the shipment of the two 35 KW sets recently installed at Masirah would definitely be uneconomical 7. On the whole if it is decided that the present care ard. maintenance parties must be engaged it is considered that it would bo preferable to leave installations in site with the maximum preventive precautions against deterioration and accept the inevitable depreciation rather than to embark on a programme of dismantling- and transfer with its attendant shipping difficulties not only now but also on the occasion of any future reopening. A ship chartered from Aden costs pounds 200 day and the return trip to Riyan Salalah and Masirah is 21 days. 9. If the stations are temporarily abandoned for a year or even for one complete monsoon period our estimate of nine months as the best case and 15 months as the worst case to guarantee serviceability for staging purposes is not an unreasonable one when the initial difficulties of shipping ard. re-entry to the sites are taken into account. If the highest priority was available for shipping and the satisfaction of our demands for replacements of deteriorated equipment is made, the period might be reduced to six months in the case of Riyan and Salalah, but it would be most unwise to underestimate the problems that will have to be faced at i.Iasirah and no revision can be contemplated in this 08.SC » 1C. Finally, as this is chiefly a works problem I respectfully suggest that A.M.S.O. (Hollinghurst and D.G-. 7. Holloway who have flown over the route should be asked to cither confirm or disagree with the foregoing. 11 . I am still of the opinion that there is no middle course and if the political and strategical situation allows I recommend evacuation, removing as much equipment stores and installations as we can over a period.Rhis would save us some 8,200 pounds a year, if B.O.^.C. including ourselves do not want to use the route. 12.

C. are now negotiating with the Sultan , of Muscat a new Civil Air Agreement which will also cover R. A.F. requirements at Masirah and Salalah 4 The- following points on which we require information fron you hava .irisen in connection with this agreement (a) The Sultan has agreed to accept H.M.G’s offer cf £5,000 annual rent provided rent is paid separately by B.O.A.C. and R. A.P. for the buildings at Salalah and Masirah, Fie is demanding £3,200 per annum which will cover monthly rent for the .American stone buildings and , round rent for other existing buildings. Please say which, if any, of the U.S. buildings the R-.A.F. will continue to use, e would prefer to dispense Yiith the use of T J.S, buildings since rent- for these represents major portion of r : ’3,2CO mentioned above. The buildings for which the Sultan is demanding ground rent are those which have been erected by the R.A.F.' and A0. fron time to time. Please define which of these you wish to retain, and in particular whether you wish to include the ''beach camp' at Salalah. Pour reply will no doub depend on what decision is reached regarding the retention of care and maintenance parties at Masirah and Salalah on which we have signalled you separately. It should be borne in mind, however, that if any of the buildings (other than the U.S. buildings which arc already the Sultan’s property) are abandoned, the cultan will regard them in future as his property, (by hilo the Sultan does not mind what arms and ammunition are maintained at Masirah, he is anxious that at Salalah they should be reduced to a minimum and in particular has asked that no bombs should be kept there. He has also objected to machine guns out might be persuaded to ag»ee to one cr two for post defence purposes. Please state what arms it is considered necessary to retain at Salalah. (o^ The Sultan has demanded (i) that the number of Askars at present employed at Salalah shall be increased to 80; (ii) tha.t should it at any time be desired to increase the present number of points to be guarded, there shall be a corresponding increase in the number of Askars. (iii that the Askars will continue to be paid for by the R.A.F. The Sultan states that the number of points to be guarded has recently increased from six to ten, hence his demand for an increased number of Askars. Please examine the possibility of reducing the points to be guarded and state the number of Askars you consider necessary at Salalah.r* - 2 - AX 2 41 contd. ( a ) The Sultan has demanded, that the Askars at Salalah shall be provided with suitable living accommodation within the limits of the aerodrome camp. It is understood that the Askars at Salalah are at present provided with very inadequate accommodation. Is this correct? ( &lt; 3') The Sultan has asked that R.A.P. vehicles stationed at Salalah and Liasirah shall bear numbers. Please see that this request is complied with. 2. 0.G.

Jo do not require irvaintenanco of airfields and facilities for use at moments notice but only to such a standard that route could be rc-oncnod for trunk services and reinforcoment flights without undue delay. In this respect bearing in mind Monsoon period wc are prepared to accept delay of nine months fron order to open up route before full use could be made of airfields for staging purposes. Wo cannot help feeling estimate of 15 months in your APX.216, 28th November, is unduly possi: \istic. 4. Comments on para 2 your APX.226 2nd January, as follows (a) If deterioration is as rapid as you anticipate suggest you inspect more frequently than.quarterly intervals suggested in my APX.2261 , 17 th December which was only rough estimate to illustrate principle. (b) There should siroly be little difficulty in Dakota landing at Masirah if airfield is inspected at regular intervals. (c) Navigational aids are not essential. Masirah and Salalah landing grounds wore regularly inspected by aircraft from. Iraq before the war, when no C. and M. parties were maintained at them. (d) Inability to import local labour to Masirah during Monsoon season is equally applicable if permanent C &amp; M parties arc established. ( 0 ) Comment on sub-para, (a) above also applies to any installations loft in Situ. 9. Request you roocncidur proposals in my APX.2261 17 th December in light of foregoing and if you agree wc will take up question of guards being provided by Sultan as suggested in para 6 of same signal. Alternatively suggest that parts of installation liable to deterioration could bo removed for storage at Aden and replaced if route has to bo reopened. 6 .

The care and maintenance establisnn.ents of Llasirah, Riyan and Salalah are already doi/n to the minimum required if the airfields are to be kept to reasonable standards. The total RiiF manpower involved io 3 officers and 46 airmen.

Periodical inspections considered uneconomical and impractical for following reasons. (ii) in 3 months runway deterioration and silting up would cost more to repair than progressive maintenance. (b) MEG.' personnel would have to be flown in a distance of 1000 miles and it would not be certain that runv/ays would then oc fit to land on. (C) There would be no navigational or aircraft safety aids at the 3 airfields. (D) local labour for Masirah cannot be imported during the nonsoon season (May - ‘-’eptonber inclusive).

Reference paragraph 5 of my express letter No. 1172 - S, dated the 19t h December, 1946. 2. The Sultan has asked for the following additions to be made in the Air Navigation Regulations : (i) The following rule to be added after or as part of rule 1 : © “The application for grant of authorisation to aircraft of a scheduled international air service to fly over or within the Sultan*s territories and territorial waters shall be made by the registered owner of the aircraft or his proxy, and shall clearly state the class of authori sation required*'. When I was in Muscat I understood that the Sultan had agreed to grant authorisations for scheduled services instead of for individual aircraft c.f. paragraph 4 of your telegram No. 21 391, dated the 9th December, 1946 (not repeated to Muscat)7 tie appears to have gone back on this but I have asked the Political Agent for further elucidation. Apart from this I see no objection to the addition. 13 (ii) The following rule to be added after paragraph 'Any laws and regulations not covered by paragraph 13 but which are generally adopted by the Inter national Air Navigation Organisation shall also apply'. The Political Agent reports that this has been drawn up with item J of Article 37 of the Chicago Convention in mind and is Intended to replace a long list of customs regulations which the Sultan wished to specify in a separate schedule. * I see no objection to the addition but suggest the inclusion of 'so far as they are applicable' or similar phrase at the end of it. (iii) The Sultan wishes paragraphs 14, 18 to 25 and 28 of the draft Egyptian Air Navigation Regulations (Section I), suitably amended and altered to meet Muscat requirements, to be included somewhere in his Regulations. I have no copy of the Egyptian Regulations and cannot comment. A copy may kindly be sent to me. Meanwhile, on the assumption that a copy is available with His Majesty's Government, it may kindly be considered whether there is any objection to rules being added ati^prpposed. 3. So far as • • •page 2 3.

Omission of word 'an' between “to' and ’'aircraft* 1 in addition suggested to Rule I would cover this point and the Sultan is likely to agree to it. 3d. W. R. HAY, Political Resident, Persian Gulf. /? ATTESTED ivSecretary to the Political Resident [ in the Persian Gulf. G.A.M.If H (h+ Mr.Donalds can Please see Col. Hay's letter below. The amendments suggested to Articles 1 to 7 of the Air Agreement seem to be reasonable and we should not have any objection to them. The Sultan does not appear to wish to exempt petrol, oil and spare parts from import duty but as this is not likely to be a very large amount, perhaps ultimately he will not bother himself with it as Col.Hay thinks. How much rental is to be paid for the aerodromes is largely a question for the Ministry of Civil Aviation. The S.A.P. appear to be # very undecided exactly what facilities they require (see Air Ministry telegram on the C* &amp; 0. file attached). ^ The Air Navigation Regulations have been little altered and apart from the question of fee to be charged for the services authorised to operate over Muscat,there is little to be decided. I agree that it is inappropriate that His Majesty's Government should be mentioned as the Agents of the Sultan in Rule 1, and I think that the omission of the words as suggested by Col. Hay is ^advisable. The special rules of conduct and security of personnel appear to be entirely reasonable and Col. Hay's suggestion that he would like to discuss them with the A.O.C. Aden will save a great deal of trouble here. We have only two spare copies of this letter which should be sent to the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Civil Aviation as suggested in the draft attached. I suggest that an extract should be made of paragraphs 4 and $ of the Political Resident's letter for the Treasury so that they can consider the question before the meeting which will probably be necessary to discuss the amenctaients in detail. *SECRET / 2231 m t ✓ y EX QO ‘im.

(a) I forward herewith the following documents : - A copy of the draft Muscat Civil Air Agreement, (b) A copy of the draft Air Navigation Regulations made by the Sultan. (c) A copy of the draft Conditions governing the use of Muscat aerodromes.’ (d) A draft of the letter it is proposed to address to the Sultan regarding facilities for the Royal Air Force.

In (a), (b) and (c) numerous alterations have been suggested as a result of discussions with the Sultan and Political Agent, Muscat. 3.. nature The following alterations are of a general (a) At the Sultan*s request the title 'His Highness' has been omitted throughout. This title was also dropped in the 1939 Treaty. (b) Where necessary the phras’e 'Muscat and Oman' has been altered to 'the territories of the Sultan' so as to cover Gwadur. f 4. The following alterations have been made in the draft Civil Air Agreement s Article 1 . The singular ,l aerodrome' has been omitted in two places as the agreement covers several aero dromes. This also applies to Articles 2, 3 and 6 . (Note. Regarding 'exclusive rights*' see Article 17 sub paragraph (iv) below). Article 2 . ....page Article 2 . 'On his behalf* has been substituted for 'On their behalf' in the first sentence. This alteration is in my opinion logical. Article 3 . The first part of this Article has been re-drafted. Authorisation may be granted either by Kis Majesty*s Government or the Sultan according to circumstances. Article 4 . See paragraph 3 of your telegram No. 21391, dated the 9th December, 1946. This Article has been re-drafted at the wish of the Sultan so as to accord as closely as possible with the terminology used in Article 5 of the Chicago Convention. Article 5 . See paragraph 6 of my telegram No. 1403 of the 3rd December, 1946. This Article has been re drafted in accordance with the Sultan*s wishes. The word 'through' has been altered to ’‘with' towards the end of the Article as the Sultan does not wish to be bothered with correspondence on technical matters. Article 6 . I have omitted the reference to Part II and III of the Agreement. The regulations and conditions printed as Parts II and III of the old Agreement were not really parts of the Agreement at all and were not signed on behalf of His Majesty’s Government. If they are attached to the Agreement they should appear as Appendices, but especially if the Agreement is to be communicated to the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization I consider it preferable that they should be treated as separate entities. The words 'by the parties to this Agreement' have been added as the Sultan asked whose agreement was required to amendments under this Article and he has approved the addition. I consider it probable, however, that before the Agreement is signed he will ask for the omission of the whole phrase 'subject to such amendments as may from time to time be agreed by the parties to this Agreement' as he has asked in the regulations and conditions nothing should appear to show that they have been framed in consultation with His Majesty’s Government, although he is willing to agree in an exchange of letters that no alterations or additions should be made without such consultation. I see no objection to the omission provided letters are exchanged .as suggested by the Sultan. Arti c le 7 . I have omitted the singular station* as unnecessary. The last sentence has been added at the Sultan’s wish. Article 15 . Paragraphs one and two have been omitted vide paragraph 8 of my telegram No. T/611, dated the 7th December, 1946. In my discussion with the Sultan I referred to the unratified 1939 Fuel Convention and the facts stated in paragraph 3 of letter No. R.5806/45, dated the 10th October, 1946, from the Ministry of Civil Aviation, but as reported the Sultan will not willingly agree to a refund of duty on fuel and oil. The Sultan wishes paragraph three to be re drafted so as to allow him to recover duty on spare parts, etc. supplied to foreign aircraft. He eventually agreed to a re-draft of the paragraph in accordance with Article 24(b) of the Chicago Convention. This will technically permit him to recover duty on spare parts supplied to civil aircraft not engaged in a scheduled international air service. As occasions for recovery of duty in these circumstances are likely to be of rare occurrence I am doubtful whether the Sultan will in practice bother himself about such recovery.i. page 3. Article 17 . (i). With regard to the annual rental, the first suggestion made to the Sultan was £ 3,000 and he countered by demanding £ 6,000. He has now agreed to accept £ 5,000 provided (a) rent is paid separately by the B.O.A.C. and R.A.F. for the buildings at Salalah and Uasirah and (b) if it is desired at a later date to develop additional landing grounds or flying boat bases there will be fresh negotiations (i.e. additional rental will be paid). He is willing to drop condition (b) if the annual rental is raised to £ 6 , 000 . (ii). The Political Agent reports that the rent which the Sultan intends to demand for the buil dings at Salalah and Masirah is likely to be heavy. The Sultan showed the Political Agent an American statement of the total capital cost which amounted to 1,000,000 dollars. The Sultan admitted that this was excessive but stated that he intended asking for rent for these buildings based on one- third of the above figure. At a subsequent interview he demanded £ 3,200 as rent for all the buildings and said that if they were not required he would dismantle them and use the materials elsewhere. I do not know whether the R.A.F. or B.G.A.C. require all the buildings, but would in any case suggest that it is desirable that we should offer the Sultan an increased rental under the Air Agreement in order to obtain the use of some or all of these buildings. I am doubtful if the Sultan will accept even £ 6,000 if the rent of these buildings and the ground rent of the other buildings (c .f . comments on paragraph 2(4) of the letter regarding facilities for the R.A.F. in paragraph 7 below) is to be covered, and I suggest that I should be authorised to go up to £ 7,500 if necessary. It would assist me if I could be informed whether the R.A.F. or B.O.A.C. are willing to dispense with the use of some of the American buildings if the Sultan insists on demanding rent for them on a capital cost basis. In dealing with this question it should be borne in mind that the Sultan is rather sore on account of what he considers the unauthorised use by the R.A.F. of these buildings c.f. correspondence ending with my demi official letter No. 715 - S, dated the 7th September, 1946, to Donaldson. (iii). With regard to condition (b) in the second sentence of sub-paragraph (i) above, throughout the negotiations the Sultan has been insisting that the aero dromes covered by the Civil Air Agreement should be specified. (He does not wish the R.A.F. to be limited to these specified . iaerodromes, and says they may use all the nine aerodromes in his territories, and he would, I think, allow them to develop | fresh aerodromes if they so desired). I have accordingly prepared a Schedule to be attached to the Agreement giving the names of the aerodromes which the Sultan regards as being covered by it. It has been specifically stated that the use of the aerodromes includes the use of flying-boat bases where these exist at the same place. Of the places I have included in the Schedule Salalah and Masirah are in regular use. At G wadu r the B.O.A.C. have recently laid moorings for use in the event of emergency landings by flying-boats. Shinas has been included because of its mention in Article 16-c.f. paragraph 9 of my telegram No. T/611, dated the 7th December, 1946, and also because the Sultan has mentioned it in his Point 19 vide document (h) listed in paragraph 2 . I have now received your telegram No. 21857 of December 18th authorising the ommission I of Article 16 but would ask that whole question of the aero- | dromes to be covered by the Agreement should be considered in j the light of what is stated in this and the next succeeding I sub-paragraph. The following landing grounds which exist have not been included Muscat, Ras al Hadd, Sohar, Shuv/aimiyah, Murbat. If it is desired that any of these should be included in the Schedule • t • •page 4. schedule, I should be grateful for instructions accordingly. (iv). It must be borne in mind that the inclusion of a landing ground in Schedule II may impose an obligation as well as conferring a privilege. In fact the Sultan has raised this point in connection with the exclusive rights conferred under Article 1 and has asked what reply for instance he is to give to the Americans if they ask his permission to develop a landing ground at a place in his territories in which we are not interested c.f. Point 21 in the Sultan*s list of Points (item (h) in paragraph 2 ). He referred -in particular to the enquiries made from him a few months ago about the use of the Shinas landing ground by the T.W.A. vide the paper forwarded under my printed letter No. 663 - S, dated the 3t*d September, 1946.* I should be grateful for instructions regarding the reply to be given to him on this point. Article 18 . The last sentence has been added at the Sultan*s wish vide paragraph 11 of my telegram No. T/611, dated the 7th December, 1946, and I suggest should be allowed to stand except that the Sultan might be asked to agree to 'review** being read for 'revision'. 5* The following alterations have been made in the Air Navigation Regulations. The Sultan has asked for more time to study these regulations and I have just heard that he has suggested further alterations. I will address you regarding these separately. (The references below are to the rules as numbered in the 1934 Agreement). Heading. This has been revised c.f. paragraph 3. Rule 1 . This has been re-inserted vide paragraph 12 of my telegram No. T/611. dated the 7th December, 1946. The Sultan has agreed that the authorisation should be for the service and not for each specific aircraft engaged on it. The question of the fee to be charged has not been discussed with him and I should be grateful for instructions regarding the advice to be given to him on this point. Please see also my comments on Point 18 in paragraph 10. Rule 14(iii). The Sultan insists that the penalties for the infringement of the Regulations should be specified. The last portion of this sub-rule has been altered accordingly. The penalties are those prescribed in KinF*s Regulation No. 1 of 1936. 6 * The following alterations have been made in the conditions governing the use of aerodromes. Heading. This has been revised c.f. paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 Article 6 . Buie 1. (i). In accordance with the Sultan*s wishes the words 'as agents of the Sultan' have been added after 'His Majesty*s Government' in the opening phrase. I am inclined to think that it is inappropriate that His Majesty*s Government should be mentioned in these conditions, especially in view of the revised heading and would suggest the omission of the words ’’or by His Majesty* s Government, as agents of the Sultan, their servants or agents'. If necessary • notices can be posted at aerodromes disclaiming responsibility on behalf of His Majesty*s Government. n . (ii). A new sentence has been added as desired by the Sultan. The last words originally read 'through the neglect' of an air service or its employees'. The Sultan has ....pa'ge 5. J The Sultan has insisted on omitting mention of M neglect ,, but has explained that if one of his subjects suffers injury tnrough his own fault damage will not be claimed, I suggest tnat the addition made be allowed to stand in its present form. ^ ^ This has been added as desired by the he is to confirm by an exchange of letters ohat the rules will be framed in consultation with the Resident. I suggest that the rule be accepted on this condition. =l!lT e 5« This is new but appears unobjectionable. - A 7 ^ ^ r f fer ence to the draft letter regarding facilities. (item (d) in paragraph 2 ), the Sultan accepts paragraph 1 thereof and in fact is willing to grant more c.f. paragraph 4 Article 17(iii) of this letter. Paragraph 2 ( 1 ) requires no comment at this stage. With regard to paragraph 2 ( 2 ), while the Sultan does no^ mind what arms and ammunition are maintained at hiasiran he is anxious that at Salalah they should be reduced to a minimum and in particular has asked that no bombs should tnere * He ha s also objected to machine-guns but mignt be persuaded to agree to one or two for post defence purposes. ^ I should be grateful for a statement of the armament which the R.A.F. consider it essential to retain at Salalah. Paragraph 2(3) requires no comment. It may be possible to omit all or part of par a grap h 2(4) if the subsidy is increased c.f. paragraph f 6 17 Oi). The 'other buildings' mentioned are those which have Deen constructed from time to time by the R.A.F. or B.O.A.C. 1 am not sure of what these buildings consist kut I understand they include a 'beach camr) M at Salalah, vide Point 1 in the Sultan*s List of Points (item (h) in paragraph 2 ). I also understand that the buildings both at oa^alah and Masirah are very much scattered no doubt as a precaution against air attack. It is desirable that in any case the R.A.F. (and if necessary the B.O.A.C.) should define at once tne ground and buildings which they wish to retain tnough it should be borne in mind that if any 'other buildinps' are aoandoned the Sultan will, regard them in future as his property. e ' H th reference to paragraph 2(5), the Sultan states tnat the number ox points to be guarded has recently een increased from six to ten, hence his demand for an increased number of askars. It is desirable that the R.A.F. should examine the possibility of reducing the points to be guarded. The Sultan will certainly insist on the continued employment of local askars at Salalah and their payment by the ^‘°* A * C * ? s the case ma y be * The Sultan has not prescribed any special conditions about the employment of guard* at Masirah and it is left to the R.A.F. or 3.0^.0? to makf their own arrangements. . ' . With reference to paragraph 2 ( 6 ), I am told that tae askars at ^alalah are at present provided with very inadequate accommodation. J I .mine WS TXToi SSfSSS ShISSSSS*page 6 12 • • • • 8 . The Sultan has asked that R.A.F. vehicles stationed at Salalah and Masirah should bear numbers. There will presumably be no difficulty in complying with this request which is not mentioned in any of the documents forwarded herewith. 9. In return for the facilities to be granted to the R.A.F. the Sultan has asked for (a) the supply on payment of certain arms and aranunition, and (b) facilities for the purchase of U.S.A. dollars. With regard to (a) the Sultan requires : 1. 250 .303 rifles latest type issued to British Army with slings and spares. 2. 1,50,000 rounds .303 ammunition. 3. 24 Service revolvers. 4. 3,000 cartridges for above revolvers. 5. 3 V.B. machine guns. He wishes these arms, etc. to be delivered at Salalah and says he requires them for a local Police force which he is thinking of raising. He proposes to store them in his fort where there is, according to him, no danger of their falling into the hands of the tribesmen. It would appear from this request that the Sultan’s negotations with the Americans for the purchase of arms (vide correspondence ending with your telegram No. 16456, dated the 2 nd September, 1946) have fallen through, though I have not questioned him on this point as the Americans might not like him to know that they had consulted us on the subject. With regard to (b), the Sultan wishes to obtain a credit*of 20,000 U.S.A. dollars during 1947 to purchase cars and trucks. Hd has said nothing about possible further requirements ,in subsequent years. I recommend that if possible both the Sultan* s requests should be granted. 10 . With reference to the exchange of letters regarding interim arrangements (items (e) and (f) in para graph 2) I instructed the Political Agent to discuss with the Sultan the latter’s demands for'a limitation of the interim period and a promise for the continuance of the war subsidy if the negotiations break down. As a result of this discussion Sultan has stated that he will wait for a reply on these points until after the proposed visit of the Political Agent to Salalah early in 1947. This means that if the negotiations are successfully concluded during this visit the Sultan* s demands will automatically lapse but that otherwise we shall have to let him have a reply. In the event of the breakdown of the negotiations the Sultan would appear to have some claim to a continuance of the war subsidy c.f. the terms of the letter addressed to him by the Political Agent on the 5th May, 1946, a copy of which v/as forwarded under endorsement No. C/119, dated the 18th May, 1946. 11. The Special Rules for the Conduct and Security of Personnel (item (g) in paragraph 2 ) contain few additions to those already in force at Salalah, which were approved by the Government of India in their express letter No. D.1726 - N/42, dated the 13th July, 1942 (no copy to India Office). I suggest that it be left to me to approve them after consultation with the Air Officer Commanding, Aden.page 7 / 12. The Sultan has agreed that his 'Points', vide item (h) in paragraph 2 , can be confirmed by a separate letter and need not be covered by any of the other documents. Some of them could however easily be included in the Conditions or Special Rules. Point 1 . B.O.A.C. buildings and beach camp. This has been discussed in paragraph 7 in my comments on paragraph 2(4) of the draft letter regarding R.A.F. facilities. Point 2 . Customs and Health buildings. We may agree. The necessity is not likely to arise for some time and spare buildings will probably be available. Point 3. Foreign employees. We may agree. Point 4 . Labour. We may agree. The Political Agent unsuccessfully endeavoured to persuade the Sultan to accept an addition to the effect that unskilled labour might with his previous permission be imported if Muscat labour were not available. We can press the point further later should occasion arise. Points 5 Currency, 6 Unloading from steamers, etc., and 7 Customs employee. We may agree. Point 8 . Transmission of telegrams. At present telegrams despatched through Cable and Wireless from Muscat are paid for as far as Aden and are transmitted by the R.A.F. from Aden to Salalah free of charge. Telegrams in the reverse direction are transmitted by the R.A.F. free of all charge though they presumably pay Cable and Wireless for the use of the cable between Aden and Muscat. The traffic does not ordinarily pass 'via Sharjah' and the Sultan when asked to explain v/hy he has used this phrase has promised to discuss the matter further when the Political Agent visits Dhofar. We may agree if possible to a conti nuance of the present concession. Point 9 . Carriage of letters. At present the B.O.A.C. and R.A.F. accept letters from the Sultan when he is in Dhofar for postage in India or Egypt as the case may be. I understand the letters are duly stamped for postage in those countries. We may agree to the continuance of this concession. Point 10 . Building materials. We may agree. Point 11 . Marbat road. We may agree. The Sultan has built a road for 50 miles along the coast from Salalah to Marbat. The R.A.F. or B.O.A.C. personnel statio ned at Salalah are unlikely to use this except for pleasure trips. Point 12 . Undesirable foreign employees. Yve may agree leaving details of procedure to be settled as occasion arises. Point 13 . Barbed wire. We may agree. Point 14 . Christian cemeteries. The Sultan is anxious that Christians dying at Salalah or Masirah should all be buried at one spot and that their graves should not be scattered about the country. This is reasonable and we may agree.page 8 Point 15 . Penalties for crimes and offences. This can, I think, he left for detailed discussion at a later stage between the Sultan and the Political Agent. Point 16 . Fuel. We may agree. Point 17 . Specification of aerodromes. See paragraph 4 Article 17(iii). /Authorisation. Point 18 ./ This refers to the question of fees. See paragraph 4, Article 3, and paragraph 5 Rule 1. Kindly state what fees are charged in Egypt c.f. paragraph 4 of my telegram No. T/611, dated the 7th December, 1946. Point 19 . Aerodromes to be used by civil aircraft. This is a repetition of Point 17. See paragraph 4 Article 17(iii). Pojnrt^gO. Manner in which authorisations are to be granted. This has been dealt with in paragraph 4 under Article 3. Presumably the Sultan will be asked to authorise annually a regular service of so many flights per week or fortnight as the case may be. Point 21 . Use or establishment by foreign lines of aerodromes not covered by the Civil Air Agreement. This point which is a most important one has been dealt with in paragraph 4 Article 17(iv). 13. An additional ‘point T which has been raised * \ separately by the Sultan and not included in his list is that the B.O.A.C. should agree to accept and carry free of charge his letters and small parcels and to grant free passage to him and his staff up to two persons between aerodromes in his territory and Karachi whenever such accommodation can be provided without dislodging passengers whose accommodation has already been secured. This should be conceded if possible. 14. The Sultan is prepared to accord the same treat ment to Indian as to British civil aircraft for so long as India remains within the Empire. Actually the Civil Air Agreement allows for little or no discrimination between British and foreign aircraft. 16. I apologise for the great length of this reference. The Sultan would, I think, be willing to accept the documents (a), (b), (c) and (d) as they now stand, except for the modifications in (b), and the only questions of real importance outstanding are dealt with in my comments on Article 17 of the Agreement in paragraph 4. I should like to be in a position to give a favourable reply to his requests contained in paragraph 9 and to answer as many as possible of the points discussed in paragraph 12 though some of these could, I think, safely be left for settlement at a later date. 16. As soon as I receive final instructions from His Majesty^ Government which I hope will not be later than the middle of January, I propose that Major Stewart should proceed to Dhofar for further discussions with the Sultan and, it is hoped, the final conclusion of the Agreement. As mail boats now very rarely call at Muscat it will be necessary to ask • • • • $page 9. to ask the A.I.O.C. to transport Major Stewart from Muscat to Dhofar by tanker, and I suggest that when the time comes this should be arranged in London with the A.I. 0 . 0*3 head office. necessary in order to obtain rapid decisions on the points at issue a conference might be held at Cairo early in January between representatives of the India Office, R.A.F. and B.O.A.C. and myself. I am not personally anxious to attend such a conference as it will interfere with ray tour programme but it might save correspondence. I would suggest that in any case while the Political Agent, Muscat, is at Salalah the Air Officer Commanding, Aden, or some senior^Air Staff Officer should meet him there and also if possible fly with him to Masirah in order to discuss on the spot future R.A.F. requirements as well as the Sultan's conditions, special rules and points so far as they affect the R.A.F. • (SOL.) h.R.HAY.

My dear friend, I thank you for your letter No.C.806-2/40, dated the 10th December, 1946, and have noted its contents. As mentioned by you, the drafts of the Civil Air ment are unlikely to be completed before our departure for Dhofar, I confirm that I am prepared to permit the continuance of the existing air facilities until the new agreement is completed and signed. But this arrangement should be treated as an interim period until the signing of the new agreement, and I should therefore like this interim period specified. It is understood that all the existing regulations and conditions will be continued during that interim period. It is also understood that in the event of no agreement being reached through the present negotiation, although I have every hope in reaching an agreement in the interest of both the parties, and for the good understanding and friendship existing between us and His Britannic Majesty*s Government, all the facilities granted during the war will be treated as indicated in paragraph 3(b) of your predecessor *s letter No.C/514 dated the 30th November, 1939.. As regards the payments the matter has been noted should an agreement be concluded. I shall be grateful to have your confirmed reply to the contents of this letter, and to say that the matter is clear.

The following further points are for consideration as a result of discussions with Sultan and further* examination of clrafm hei'e. 3.

Presumably I can give him this. 4. Article 3, Sultan- wishes to retain power to issue authorisations for c ommercia 1 aircraft only on ■payment of fee.. His object is to increase his revenues and he informed me that Egyptian Government charge £62 per aircraft per c.nnum .^for authorisation.

Sultan will agree to Article permitting correspondence an technical matters concerning management of aerodromes being conducted through relevant British author!cies, 6 . Article 6 . The reference to ,s the Schedule” appears to me to-be wrong. The conditions are contained in Part- (? ill) (‘of) draft. 7. Article 7, Sultan wishes an addition made to the effect.

After discussion with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, we have concluded that the future requirements of the K.A-F* in Muscat may be defined as follows (a) The right to land aircraft in transit at Massirah and Salalah; (b) The right to keep at each airfield a small quantity of stores and equipment with which to service aircraft in transit; (c) The right to station permanently at each airfield up to 50 personnel for guarding stores and equipment and for airfield maintenance. (It is unlikly that this right will ever be exercised unless Civil Aviation decide to make no use at all of the two airfields); (d) The right to station temporarily at any time at each airfield up to 200 R.A.F. personnel including the 50 who may or may not be stationed there at the time for the purpose of servicing aircraft in transit. 2. In the event of the Persian Gulf air route being denied to us, we should have to negotiate for a fresh agreement giving us the right to station permanently full scale staging posts at each airfield.

Copy of a letter from the Ministry of Civil Aviation dated 10th Dated 10th October) October is forwarded herewith together with the draft of a (without end). ) Civil Aviation Agreement which has been amended in accordance with the suggestions contained therein. As explained in ray express letter under reference H*M.G. had it in mind that R.A.F* requirements in Muscat would best be covered by an exchange of letters appended to this agreement. H.M.G, would be prepared to pay up to £9,000 a year for their overall requirements of both civil aviation and R.A.F. facilities and v/ithin this limit they would leave it to you to negotiate most favourable terms possible, and if £9,000 proved insufficient would require that you should refer to me again. They contemplated that period of agreement should be for seven years in first instance, renewable at option of H.M.G. with concurrence of Sultan. 3. I note however from your- Express Letter No,829-S of 1st October that you consider that Sultan may not be willing to agree to grant of facilities for the unlimited use by R.A.F. of aerodromes on Muscat territory, and in particular to the permanent stationing of R.A.F. personnel there, without some substantial quid pro quo, and that you consider it essential that R.A.F, requirements should be defined more specifically. The latter point is being taken up with the Air Ministry, and a further communication will be sent to you in due course. 4. Meanwhile I should be glad if you would consider the proposals contained in this letter and let me have any comments. You will no doubt consider it undesirable to initiate any discussions with the Sultan until you receive the further communication promised in paragraph 3 above.

ARIEL HOUSE, STRAND, /o LONDON, W.C.2. * October, 1946, ar Harrison, In his letter of the 5th September Jones explained to you the difficulty that had suddenly confronted us in the matter of the Muscat Civil Air Agreement, owing to the*'unebepected change of mind on the part of B.O.A.C. in respect of the commercial prospects of the Hadramaut route. * ... - “* * * 4 We have given the matter careful consideration and the following appear to be the relevant factors:~ (i) The R.A.P. have a strategic requirement for this route; (ii) The Sultan, as experience lias shown, is prepared to give facilities to the R.A.F. under the cover of a Civil Aviation facade, but it is by no means sure that he will be prepared To agree to the establish ment of military bases in his territory. ^ - (iii) If he will not agree to this, and no civil arrange ment is made, there will be a dangerous vacuum, and some other power may offer to undertake the provi sion of facilities for-Civil Aviation. As is shown by the correspondence of which you sent us copies with your No. EXT.6286 of 14th September, 1946, T.W.A. are already making approaches to the Sultan. P.A.K® Harrison, Esq., India Office, King Charles Street, London. S.W.l. / (iv)B.O.A.C^s hesitancy is perhaps due to the calcu lation that in the immediate future the only means of providing a South Arabian service is by an ex tension of the U.K. - Y/est Africa Tudor II service, since otherwise the aircraft would have no base. An operation by Tudor II s along the Hadramaut route might certainly prove unprofitable, but we have other plans for the area and are at the moment con sidering setting up a local' airline based on Aden which would serve the Aden Protectorate and British Somaliland, and also operate to Addis Ababa and Jedda and ultimately perhaps to Cairo and Nairobi and Karachi. 'In view of the strong commercial ties between Aden and India such a line would almost certainly wish to operate a service along the Hadrainaut Coast to Karachi. In short, whether immediately or in the future, ' we have a requirement for civil facilities along this route, and it would be a short-sighted policy to allow the opportunity of securing them to lapse. b We have accordingly readied the 'conclusion that the I only prooer course is to go ahead with the proposals for a Civil Aviation Agreement with the Sultan. As regards points of detail we have the following comments to make on the draft form of Agreement which you prepared.\ V -3- (1) Article 15. V/e suggest that the first paragraph should run as follows '15. Whilst all oil and petrol for the use of all aircraft, other than Royal Air Force requirements, will be subject to the importation duties at the time existing. His Highness agrees to refund quar terly the duties collected on all oil and fuel that , may have been actually issued to an aircraft for use ) in flight, such amounts being certified by the agent or agents appointed as suppliers etc. etc.' might be possible to contend that B.O.A.C. should enjoy the privilege of remission of the duty on fuel * and oil in return for the subsidy that the U.K. will g pay fhe Sultan, and that this does not amount to dis crimination, but ,the argument vrould be rather thin, and we are of opinion that all international operators will have to be put on the same footing. There is no universally accepted principle in regard to duties on fuel and oil, but the* unratified 1939 Fuel Convention which is observed by many countries as a matter of courtesy grants exermotion in respect of fuel and oil taken on board an aircraft. for flights abroad . In the case of Muscat however, fuel may be taken on for flights between Masirah and Salaleh both of which are within the Sultan’s territory, and the difficulty of determining in practice what is intended for flights within the territory, and what for flights abroad, would introduce insuperable complications. (2) Schedule I. Landing Fees. It is suggested that the revised scale of charges for hard runways in the U.K. as shown in the last column of Notice to Airmen No. JQ/I+jS (copy attached) should be substituted. It is possible that the scale may have again to be altered as a result of P.I.C.A.O. agreements, but provision for amendment existing in Article 9 of the Agreement. The scale of housing fees may remain for the present as it is. We should like in this connection to be dear that the power to amend the schedule effec tively rests in His Majesty’s Government and that the Sultan’s consent is not required. The draft / may: ' &gt; -4- 'Y /may ambiguous on this point.’ If you are,, satisfied /Vv r ']^‘ /that it gives us what we want let us leav0 £t. 3ut^ p £ should he grateful for your confirmation tha.t it ^ does. (3) Schedule II. Attendance ]?ees. This shoijG.d he anitted altogether. These fees date from an era when airfields ' were not permanently manned and the arrival of an craft necessitated the ad hoc assembly of /the staff Jf' ''/ '0 Under modem conditions the landing fee iA intend©^ * cover the cost of the ordinary services. W±ltS ^onnJwdLan of dihis schedule will involve a slight amJndirerit to Article 9* \g| — $ ♦ I am sending copies of this letter to Warran at the Air lELnistry and Nasmyth at the Treasury. t Yours ' c „ . v # W V cci MINISTRY OF CIVIL AVIATION ARIEL HOUSE, STRAND, &lt; Tel.

Political Agent, T'uscat, comments that facilities contemplated for R.A.F. permit unlimited use of aerodromes on Luscat territory for all purposes, c.g., the permanent stationing of as many squadrons as Air Ministry may desire. This is scarcely likely to be acceptable to the Sultan especially as His Majesty's Government are not prepared to allow R.A.F. to be used in Sultan's interests. 3. Pre-war facilities granted to the R.A.F. did not include stationing of personnel permanently at any aerodrome in the Sultanate, and I therefore consider it essential that R.A.F. requirements should be defined more specifically especially so far as the question of stationing of aircraft and personnel is concerned. 4. The Political Agent considers that the Sultan will readily agree to all facilities required for aircraft in transit but will object to stationing of personnel unless offered a substantial quid pro quo.

They were in favour of drafting an entirely new agreement in conformity with the Chicago Agreements. M.C*A*s letter below tells quite a different story. * it looks at first sight as if B.O.A.C. are ratting and do not consider a civil air service along the South Arabian coast comnercially justified. M.C.A., however, have asked for a 'little time' to consider the matter further in consultation with B.O.A.C. But time is flying. H.M.G*s present air facilities cease at the aid of the year with the expiry of the War Subsidy Agreement and we have given the Sultan of Muscat an assurance that he would be given ample time for the examination of any new proposals H.M.G. might put forward. As to present action, there are two obvious possibilities (a) we might give M.C.A. a few more days grace, (b) we can assume that there is no justification for a civil air service along the South Coast of Arabia and proceed accordingly. Alternative (a) would appear to be the better course to adopt for the moment. Until we definitely know what M.C*A*s final answer is to be it would be perhaps unwise to expend unnecessary energy. The main argument against At,, ^ it, of course, is the time factor, as indicated abo^^. If we act on (b), the question becomes primarily one for the Air Ministry to consider and a separate military agreement would introduce several complications. I have discussed this matter with Warran (Air Ministry) and Jones (Ministry of Civil Aviation) and they agree that we should hang on for the present.

A. Div. 1 RIEL HOUSE, STRAND, LONDON, W.C.2. 40 S | ^ ^ 5th September, 1946. Dear Harrison, I much regret that we are unable, at the moment, to give you our final views on the draft of the Muscat Civil Air Agreement. Notwithstanding the previous categorical assurances given to us by B.O.A.C. to the effect that they were satisfied with regard to the commercial potential of a trans-Africa - India service via the Hadramaut Coast, they are now vacillating, and it is by no means certain that we can justify proceeding with an agreement the main raison d’etre for which is the civil requirement. At our previous meeting you will recall that we were unable to state whether or not there would be a commercial requirement, but subsequently, B.O.A.C. reached the conclusion, after examination of all the relevant factors, that it was a promising route from the commercial point of view. They thereupon confirmed that they were planning for the introduction of a service in due course. We confirmed this information with them immediately prior to our meeting on 7th August, and it is only now that they tell us that, after all, they regard the Hadramaut route primarily as a strategic one which they would only operate commercially if instructed to do so. On the assumption that there is, in fact, no commercial justification for a civil air service, we couldscarcely act, as sponsors for the agreement with the Sultan of Muscat, and it would then become a matter primarily for the Air Ministry to consider, purely flom the strategic point gf view. Please do not accept this as the last word, but I thought it desirable to explain the position as we see it at this stage, and to ask you to give us a little more time to consider the matter further, in consultation with B.O.A.C. I am afraid this means that it may not be practicable for the discussions with the Sultan of Muscat to take place as early as you had contemplated. For our part, we apologise most humbly for unwittingly misleading you about the commercial aspect, at tbs recent meeting, through no fault of our own* We will endeavour to get the matter finally cleared up as early as possible* I am sending copies of this letter to Warran and Grant at the Air Ministry.

Air ^ facilities in Muscat. • 2. •ihe Goverrment of India* s views are as fellows:- The Question of post-war d.r facilities in Muscat must be examined from two aspects: strategic and commercial. From the strategic point of view, the oouth Arabian Coa£t is of equal importance to the defence of India and to empire lines of communications, particularly in the event of a deterioration in the Middle &amp;ast situation. From the commercial point of view, on present indications there Is little or no possibility of India being able to S3t up within the next two or three years an air service to liast Africa via the south Arabian Coast, but such a service is bound to come ultimately and the advantage of having secured rights end facilities on the oouth Arabian Coast in advance is evident. There is little wisdom in abandoning all that has been built in the shape of aerodromes, etc. during the war: and while under the Chicago Convention agreements for exclusive Civil aviation rights cannot be made and other countries have a right to the use of all facilities on psyment it is apparent that, given Muscat 1 s in^Hity to provide or maintain such facilities hepsself, the country which obtains by agreement the right to maintain aerodromes etc. in Muscat territory, secures a position of advantage. Under present arrangements all p^rm^nts for strategic or imperial (as opposed to purely Indian) air routes aie the responsibility of His Majesty* s Government and not o-f India. If. therefore, an air agreement is negotiated in the immediate future wi^th tre sultan for strategic considerations only, ihdfe cannot properly be called upon to share the payments involved. On the other hand if it is a question of negotiating rights for commercial aviation, India*s ultimate interests and conse quent liability for payments become apparent. The question then arises whether in the absence of any immediate prospect of development of commercial aviation on this route, India should assume any immediate financial liability on the expiry of the $ar subsidy in order to secure a position of advantage in the Muscat sector of the route. In view of constitutional changes likely to occur in India in the immediate future it becomes inevitable that ayf=inal decision on the problem stated in the preceding paragraph should be deferred for two or three months.M.

HI* (M-* March, 19^* SECRET Ext. 15^2A 6 Dear Nasmith, Thanl: you for 3 ^our letter No. S.45336 of the 2nd March in connection with the Muscat War Subsidy Agreement. 2. With regard to your first point it was certainly our understanding, and I thunk it is clear to those concerned, that the proposal was for the extension of the war subsidy until the end of 1946 only. 3. With regard to your point (2), we are, as you say, pursuing the question of an approach to the Sultan for such other facilities as H.M.G. and the Government of India will require in Muscat territory after the end of 1946. So far as we can at present foresee these requirements are likely to be restricted to facilities for the R.A.F. and civil aviation and H.M.G’s sug estions were contained in India Office telegram 1090 of the 16th January to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The latter’s views were contained in his telegram No.125 of 26th January and we are still awaiting the Government of India’s comments. We will of course keep you in touch with further developments, mth particular reference to the financial implications. 4# We have noted that the approximate value of the gift of arms to which you agreed is £2,000. 5. I am sending copy of this letter to the recipients of yours, and also copying the correspondence to the Government of I n dia and the Political Resident. Yours sincerely, J.A.

Since the lapae of the Muscat Civil Oil)Agreement some years ago the B.O.A.C. have been relying for their facilities in Muscat on the war subsidy agreement between H.M. G. and the Sultan, under which is granted the necessary facilities in the Sultan* s territories during the war, in return for an annual payment of £1H,000. There is no mention in this a^^reenent of any remission of customs duties on petrol and oil* It was suggested to the Ministry of Civil Aviation in Mr. Harrison* s letter No. Ext. 223^^45 of 21st June that it was desirable to initiate * ‘ negotiations with the Sultan for a new Civil &lt;)i\ Agreement / which wool cover both the Government of Indian's and H.M.G. *s requirements. Such an agreement would naturally cover the question of remission of customs duties on petrol and oil* The Ministry of Civil Aviation have, however, been unwilling to agree to the initiation of such negotiations until a decision about the lease of Masirah Island has been reached.

Hie iogional Director of the British Overseas Airways Corporation in India has been informed ty tbs Director of Civil Aviation in India that exemption can only be granted in respect of the five services a week covered by the pre-war iSrapire Air Mail Scheme Agreement, and that duty must be paid by the Corporation for fuel and oil uplifted by aircraft operating services in excess of this number. The effect of this ruling is that the Corporation are required to pay duty on fuel and oil used by their Sunderland aircraft operating the twice weekly flying boat service United Kingdom - Calcutta, and the four times weekly service U.K. - Calcutta - Rangoon. 3* The Corporation have asked for assistance in obtaining exemption from this duty and tire question has been tha subject of informal discussion between this Department and the India Office in the past, but so far agreement hns not been reached. It is realised that the additional services now operated by the British Overseas Airways Corporation do not cane within the scope of the Empire Air Mail Scheme Agreement and the statement made by the Coverment of India ih their letter Number 25-V( * 21)/i+A dated 9th November 19-44* that the necessity fer these additional services is purely military is also agreed.

It has been suggested by the Director of Civil Aviation in India that British Overseas Airways Corporation should obtain their fuel and oil from the Royal Air Force and thus evade the payment of duty* But this is not a practicable solution, as the Corporation is under contract to obtain its supplies fron the Shell Company, and to obtain them from other sources would be to violate their contract. Nor can the Royal Air Force undertake the responsibility of keeping suitable stocks always available* 4* The present operations of the British Overseas Airways Corporation are not ecranercial in character and the reason for the inor ase dn frequency of the trans-India services has been the transportation of personnel and material required for the war in the Far Hast. Since the successful prosecution of the war in the Far Bast has a direct bearing on the safety of India it is considered that the maintenance of essential war comnunicallona by the British Overseas Airways Corporation should be regarded as 'Defence Services', for this purpose.- 5. It would therefore be appreciated if further consideration • could be given to this case in which it appears to this Department that an unjustified financial burden is being imposed on the British Overseas Airways Corporation.mamm i Vi A /'j r_&gt; FV/- co Muscat Civil Air Agreement of 1934 ? r Brr , noc avyare o.l pr-eoiee nature of facilitiee (whion tyere apparently not specified) but they presumably included arrar^ments rev Gstabiishnsn; 01 K.A.r.

In this Paper His Majesty's Government present their general policy for the development of British civil air transport and the operation of air routes for the carriage of passengers, freight and mails. 2. In determining policy the field of civil aviation must be viewed as a whole and a plan, to be effective and practical, must cover all routes in which the United Kingdom is interested—Commonwealth, foreign and internal. 3. The United Kingdom policy on air transport in the international sphere, as set out in the White Paper on “ International Air Transport ” (Cmd. 6561) and elaborated in the United Kingdom proposals made at Chicago, was based upon the fundamental principle of order in the air, i.e.—the full and fair development of air services to meet all requirements coupled with the elimina tion of wasteful and subsidised competition. So too, our national policy, while it must stimulate and encourage development and initiative, should do so within an ordered plan. 4. Civil aviation is essentially a transport business. Its problems are in many ways analogous to those of transport by land and by sea. To make our national air services effective, we must not only draw upon the best of aviation knowledge and skill at our command, but must also make the fullest use of the ripe experience and world-wide organisation which has been built up over many years by British enterprise and initiative in other forms of transport. This does not mean that His Majesty’s Government regard any industry or undertaking as having a vested right to share in civil air transport. The test which has been applied in evolving the plan set out in this Paper is: Where can the best contribution to British air transport be obtained, and how can it most effectively be used to build up an organisation which will fulfil our public, commercial, and social needs? 5. It is fully recognised, not only by His Majesty's Government but also by those who are concerned in existing methods of transport by land and by sea, that the competition of air services must be met in the air. Our national and Commonwealth interests—and, indeed, the interests of the older forms of transport themselves—cannot be served by attempting to retard or restrict new methods of.carriage. They can best be promoted by creating and fostering the most effective air transport system we can develop at home and overseas. 6. Air transport is a service in which the community as a whole has a direct interest. The criterion as to whether a particular route should be flown is not merely: Is it commercially profitable? There are services which are essential in the public interest, but which offer little or no prospect of a direct financial return. Unlimited competition in the air by private operators would mean that competing services would be concentrated on the remunerative routes; and that the taxpayer, while reaping no benefit from the more lucrative routes, would be compelled to support by subsidies those services which, although desirable for public or social reasons, would initially, at any rate, be run at a loss, and m'ght, in some cases, never show a profit. On the other hand, if an air transport undertaking is assured of the exclusive right to operate a sufficient proportion of remunerative services and to develop these to the full, it can and should accept the obligation to run unremunera- hve services as part of its general transport system. It is, there fore. a necessary part of the Government’s plan, that the undertakings which will be granted the right to run air services both within the Unitedo Kingdom and between the United Kingdom and other countries, shall possess &amp; such right on their allotted routes, to the exclusion of other United K.ngdom air transport operators. /-N 7. While in the interests of order and economy, competition between United Kingdom operators on individual air routes must be eliminated, there remains a field of development which is open to and will, in the Government’s view, be best served and stimulated by the entry of competing operators. Subject to the observance of the necessary safety and navigational requirements, it is not intended to restrict the operation of charter aircraft. Requisites of an Air Transport Organisation. 8. In the view of His Majesty’s Government, the following are the requisites of an efficient air transport organisation:— (а) The Units must be large enough to operate economically but not so large or widespread as to preclude effective supervision along every route. (б) Each Unit must have an efficient organisation covering every area served by its air lines to handle passengers, freight and mail, together with first class knowledge and experience of transportation and facilities for full co-operation with other forms of transport wherever this can promote air travel. (c) Provision must be made for the economical use and maintenance of aircraft. (d) The most effective arrangements must be made for the training of air crews and ground staff and for their welfare. (e) There must be close co-operation between the users and the manu facturers in deciding the types of aircraft to be used. (/) The organisation should be capable of providing training for the crews of Commonwealth or foreign countries, and should also be able to supply these countries, where required, with technical and operational help. 9. Size of Units .—The Government are convinced that the policy of a single chosen instrument, whatever may have been its merits in the past, is unsuited to deal with the great expansion of the future. There must, there fore, be several air transport undertakings. A single entity, even if it could effectively include and use all the varied experience of aviation and trans portation which it is necessary to bring in, would be too large and far-flung to fulfil the requirement of individual supervision of all the routes operated. Moreover, while as stated above, it is clearly desirable to eliminate wasteful competition between British operators on the same route, it is none the less desirable both to avoid a sealed pattern of management and operation and to encourage different managements to try out their own ideas. This would in no way prevent the constant pooling of experience and the Government’s plan is designed to secure this. 10. Civil Aviation as a Transport Problem.—tex transport can be greatly assisted and stimulated by co-operation with other systems of transport. To the solution of the problems which air transport poses British enterprises already engaged in other branches of the transport and travel business can, alike with the British Overseas Airways Corporation, bring_ a valuable contribution. Their extensive organisation and connections both in the United Kingdom and overseas can with great economy of management be used to serve air transport equally with land and sea transport. Through their co operation, the fullest use can be made of through-bookings, interavailability11 * u.* e ' 4 of tickets between air and other forms of transport and the most convenient rail and sea connections on all parts of the air routes. It is therefore of the essence of the Government’s plan that those interests concerned in transport by sea and by land should be brought into a real and effective partnership with the organisations which will be responsible for transport by air. 11. Carriage of Mails by Air. —The Government have a special interest in the carriage of mails by air. The Postmaster General is considering, in consultation with the Minister for Civil Aviation and the undertakings which will operate the future British air services, the best and fullest use which can be made of those services for the carnage of air mail. 12. Routes to be operated by Separate Units. —Much consideration has been given to the number of air transport units which will be most effective at the present stage, and the routes which they should cover. The Government have decided that the most efficient organisation will be obtained by means of three main Air Transport Corporations which will be responsible for air services on the following routes: (1) The Commonwealth air routes together with the trans-Atlantic service to the United States and the services to China and the Far East. (2) European air routes and the internal services of the United Kingdom. (3) The South American route. 13. It is obviously convenient that the same Corporation which will operate the air route from the United Kingdom to Canada, should also operate the Atlantic service to the United States. When conditions permit the inaugu ration of regular civil air services to China and other parts of the Far East, these will link naturally with the services to India and Australia, and it is desirable that they should be associated with the same Corporation. 14. The Government are satisfied that the arguments in favour of uniting internal services of the United Kingdom and services from the United Kingdom to Europe in a single Corporation are overwhelming. While the majority of continental services will focus on London, connections will be required from the outset with other centres of population and industry in the United Kingdom; and, as air transport develops, services will run direct from some of these centres to the Continent. The same type of aircraft will be equally suitable for many of the European and internal services; and the economical use of such aircraft will be greatly increased if they can be drawn from a pool available for European and internal services in accordance with the fluctuating seasonal and other traffic demands on individual routes. 15. The trunk route from the United Kingdom to South America presents a new field for British civil aviation. It is one which our long and close relations with the States of that Continent make it essential that we should enter. The Structure of the Corporations. 16. Commonwealth routes {including the Atlantic). —The Commonwealth and Alantic routes, together with the ultimate extensions to China and the Far East, will be assigned to the British Overseas Airways Corporation. This Corporation and their predecessor, Imperial Airways, have been responsible for the develop ment and operation of these routes in the past. They are in close relations with the corresponding operators of other Commonwealth countries. They are therefore clearly the appropriate instrument for the operation and further develooment of these routes. On many of the routes, however, a valuable contribution can be made by British Shipping Lines with their well-established organisation and local connections, and their experience of the special trans-port requirements of particular areas served. It is therefore proposed that these Shipping Lines shall be afforded the opportunity of becoming associated with B.O.A.C. in the operation of those routes to which they can make a useful contribution; an association which is welcomed alike by B.O.A.C. and the Shipping Lines. It will probably be convenient, in any case, for B.O.A.C. to operate certain of these routes through subsidiary companies; and as the interest and organisation of the different Shipping Lines is confined to par ticular routes, such a structure will clearly be desirable for those services in which British Shipping Lines participate. In any subsidiary companies, ' the predominant financial and managerial interest will normally be held by B.O.A.C.; but the Shipping Lines will, at their own risk, take a share in the capital, and their transport experience and commercial acumen will be represented on the boards. It is the determination of all the Shipping Lines which have expressed a desire to participate, as it is of His Majesty s Government, that the air routes with which they are to be associated shall be fully and successfully developed. 17. European and Internal Routes .—An agreed schedule of European and Internal United Kingdom routes will be assigned to a new company in which the participants will be the Railway Companies, the Short Sea Shipping Lines, Travel Agencies and B.O.A.C. and such other pre-war operators as desire to participate. In the first four groups is concentrated a great wealth of British knowledge and experience of aviation, transport and travel problems. In addition to their knowledge of United Kingdom and European traffic needs and their extensive organisation here and on the Continent, the Railways and their associated air companies have, in the past, successfully operated the great majority of the internal air services of the United Kingdom. The Short Sea Shipping Lines operate and have built up a valuable organisation and goodwill in connection with sea routes to Europe, some of them have also been associated with the operation of air lines in the past. The Travel Agencies combine a peculiar knowledge of the needs of the travelling and touring public with a wide organisation in this country and throughout the Continent. All the proposed participants are agreed on the importance of B.O.A.C. having its share in this Corporation. It will bring to it all its knowledge of aviation and its experience of the continental air-routes which its predecessors operated before the war. 18. Although the great majority of European and internal air services were previously operated by B.O.A.C., the Railway Companies or the Short Sea Shipping Lines, there was a small number of independent British operators who ran air lines before the war. All but one of these have been compelled to cease operating during the war, but the Government considered it fair to afford them an opportunity of taking up shares in the new company on the same terms as the other participants. In certain cases these operators have acquired a knowledge and experience of particular local internal routes to be included in the agreed schedule, upon which it may be m the public interest to draw. Where the Government is satisfied that this is desirable, the possibility of forming companies subsidiary to the main Corporation to operate these routes, will not be excluded. In such a case the pre-war operator will be afforded an opportunity of participating in the capital of the sub sidiary company instead of or in addition to taking up shares in the new Corporation. in. As stated in paragraph 6 it is an essential part of the Government s plan that the new Corporation shall be responsible for all the British air services on the scheduled routes. Its right to run on these routes within the United Kingdom will be exclusive. Its services to Europe will be run in parallel or, it is hoped, in some cases in conjunction with the services of other ^ A a 40773 —co iviuscQb Givij.

Mo ft 4 v» -' I i ac hnf ; xt t hey J. c iwhioa ostablishnent 6 European countries to the United Kingdom. These exclusive rights are clearly necessary to give economical operation and the running of a maxi mum number of air services. The plan will, therefore, provide for the Corporation to run some services, both in the United Kingdom and in Europe, which will initially be run at a loss and some of which may never show a profit. Services of this kind are necessary in the public interest and a com prehensive schedule of services will be settled which will serve the public interest as well as fulfilling purely commercial traffic needs. 20. By bringing into the Corporation those interests which are concerned with land and sea travel in the United Kingdom and to Europe, arrangements ^ will be made for interavailability of tickets for the different forms of travel on all stages of the routes, for the use of the existing offices and agencies of the various participants both at home and abroad, and for the most con venient adjustment of times and frequencies of services in the interest of air travellers to facilitate through connections with other forms of transport. 21. The European and internal air routes are likely to be more lucrative than some of the Commonwealth routes which are to be assigned to B.O.A.C. as the direct operating Corporation. The Government therefore think it right that the financial interest of B.O.A.C. in the new Corporation which will operate the European and internal air routes should be assessed in the light of this consideration as well as of the technical contribution which it can make to the new Corporation. While it is not proposed that B.O.A.C. should have a majority holding in the new Corporation, it is intended that its interest should be substantial. , 22. South American Route. —The South American route will be assigned to a new company in which the majority participants will be those British Shipping Lines operating to South America who have associated together for this purpose as British Latin American Airlines Limited. Here again it is proposed that B.O.A.C. should participate in the capital and manage ment of the new Corporation, but its share in the capital will be smaller than that which it will receive in the Corporation responsible for the European and internal services. The British Shipping Lines which have for so many years carried a large proportion of the passengers and trade between Europe and South America and have their wide connections and organisation and their goodwill in the areas to be served by the new air route are, in the view of His Majesty's Government, in the best position to make the service a success. They have expressed their willingness to risk their own capital in operating the route without subsidy. 23. Transfer of Shares in the Air Transport Corporations. —The transport and travel organisations which have been invited by the Government to participate in the new plan, have been selected by reason of the positive contribution which they can make in skill and experience to the new Cor porations. That they are prepared to invest their own money without any Government guarantee is an indication of their belief in the future of civil air transport and an earnest of their intention to operate efficiently; but they have not been invited merely as investors. They will take a permanent stake in the enterprise; and the Government has accordingly laid it down that there shall be no transfer of the shares in the capital of the new com panies which are allotted to the participants. This will apply not only to the two new main air transport Corporations but also to the subsidiary com panies which may be formed by B.O.A.C. to operate specific Commonwealth or Atlantic routes in which Shipping Lines may participate, and to any other subsidiary companies which may be formed by the other main air transport Corf Islar the 1 24 anyc Corp line the ( or h ^^xpe aons acqu Co-o 25 and and i 26 skill this lishn whic 27 tions be g the ( throi inter civil the ' 28 ditioi “ m&lt; for 1 mem allov not 1: pora this Unic 29 — Tt will the othei the ' appr upor the Asso part 30 and as th and7 Corporations to operate particular services, such as those to the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, where constitutional or other considerations make the formation of subsidiary companies desirable. 24. Payment for Goodwill. —His Majesty’s Government do not regard anyone as having a vested interest in the air. Although the new air transport Corporations will be entitled to acquire at a fair valuation from existing air line operators any physical assets which are needed for the new services, the Government do not feel they would be justified in approving an allowance or issue of shares to participants in respect of goodwill or “ development ^j^xpenses ” previously incurred. The whole of the capital of the new Corpora- cions and their subsidiaries will thus be represented either by physical assets acquired or cash subscribed. Co-operation between the three Air Transport Corporations. 25. Overhaul of Aircraft. —In order to ensure the maximum of efficiency and economy, the three Air Transport Corporations will join in the creation and management of a combined organisation for the overhaul of aircraft. 26. Training of Air Crews and Ground Staff. —The highest standards of skill and reliability must be achieved for air crews and ground staff. For this purpose the three Corporations will maintain a combined training estab lishment at which their flying and technical staffs will be trained, and at which refresher courses will be available. 27. Recruitment of Staff. —The constituent elements of the three Corpora tions have expressed their keen desire that every possible opportunity shall be given to officers and men of the Royal Air Force to take service with the Corporations. Close relations will be maintained with the Air Council, through the Minister for Civil Aviation, in order to give full effect to this intention. It will, however, be appreciated that openings for employment in civil air transport will not be large compared with the war-time strength of the Royal Air Force. 28. Welfare of Staff. —His Majesty’s Government will also make it a con dition that the terms of service of these Corporations shall be those of a model employer and in particular that special provision shall be made for pilots and other members of air crews in the event of death or disable ment while engaged on flying duties, and for the granting of superannuation allowances to those classes for whom suitably paid ground employment can not be provided when they are past flying age. The participants in the Cor porations have expressed their ready assent to this condition. A scheme of this kind which was settled in agreement with the appropriate employees’ Unions, is already in operation in the case of B.O.A.C. 29. Relation of Minister for Civil Aviation to the Air Transport Corporations. —The appointment of members of the British Overseas Airways Corporation will be vested in the Minister for Civil Aviation; and he will also approve the appointment of the representatives of B.O.A.C. on the Boards of the other two main operating companies. The appointments of Directors upon the Boards of the other two main operating companies will be subject to approval by the Minister, as will the representatives of the Shipping Lines upon the Boards of the subsidiary companies of B.O.A.C. The approval of the Minister will also be required to the Memorandum and Articles of Association of all the companies, both main and subsidiary, which play a part in the scheme. 30. Once the Corporations and subsidiary companies have been established and the members of their Boards appointed or approved by the M'nister, as the case may be, it is a cardinal principle of the plan that the Corporations and the companies should be responsible for the operation and managementto Muscat' Civil Air not aware of precis.

While management must vest in the Corporations and companies, the Minister must have a general control over broad aviation policy. Thus all companies must conform to the policy laid down by International Convention or by bilateral or multilateral agreements entered into with other States by His Majesty’s Government. Further, it is part of the plan that the Corporations shall operate, either directly or through their approved subsidiaries, all the air routes which are assigned to them. As stated above, an agreed schedule of routes so assigned to each of the Corporations will be settled. These routes the Corporations will undertake to operate. They will not have the power to cease operation on any scheduled route without the consent of the Minister; but such consent will not be un^ reasonably withheld if events should prove that one or other of the agreed routes is neither commercially practicable nor required for the public interest. Subsidies. 31. The general policy of His Majesty’s Government is that both internal and external air services should operate as far as possible without subsidy. 32. Internal Services .—So far as internal services in the United Kingdom are concerned the participants in the Corporation to which these routes will be assigned—and who are investing their own money therein—are willing to run without subsidy the agreed schedule of routes which will include, as well as the remunerative services, those routes which the Government regard as desirable in the public interest although some of them, if they were dealt with in isolation, could not be run at a profit. 33. International Services .—In the international field the Government have already declared that it is a cardinal aim of their policy to reduce wasteful competitive practices and, in particular, to control subsidies with the object of ultimately eliminating them altogether. To this end, they proposed in the White Paper on International Air Transport (Cmd. 6561) and later expounded at Chicago, their considered plan for avoiding un economic competition in international air services, by maintaining a broad equilibrium between transport capacity and traffic offering, a fair division of services between the national air lines engaged on international routes, and an agreement as to freight and passenger charges. His Majesty’s Govern ment had hoped to secure this by multilateral convention. This did not prove to be possible, but the broad principles laid down in the White Paper on International Air Transport remain the policy of His Majesty’s Govern ment. In any reciprocal arrangements which they make with foreign countries, the Government will stipulate for the reasonable application of these principles. In this way it is hoped that wasteful competition and subsidies may be largely eliminated upon the international routes in which Great Britain is interested. It is the intention that the agreed schedule of services on the European routes and the Latin American service should be operated without subsidy; provided always that services which the Government regard as essential to maintain are not faced with highly subsidised competition. 34. Commonwealth Services .—In the past the operation of certain of the Commonwealth routes has required a subsidy. These routes are so essential in the interests of Commonwealth communications that His Majesty’s Govern ment will be prepared to afford the necessary financial help to enable B.O.A.C. to operate them. New Routes. 35. It is intended that the agreed schedule of routes to be initially assigned to the three Corporations shall include all those upon which, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, it is essential that United Kingdom Air Lines should9 (jUJpf be ready to operate as soon as war conditions permit and the necessary air- ^ craft are available. In the future as air traffic develops, the need for new routes will emerge. It is not intended to make any present commitment as to the right to operate new routes. The Government consider that any new routes should be left open to whatever operator—whether one of the main Corporations or some entirely new operator—can establish that he is best fitted to run them. 36. Power of the Government to require Corporations to operate new routes. Ihe Government, however, may from time to time wish to have operated, lather within the Commonwealth or outside it, a particular route which is not in the agreed schedule of services, and which is not the subject of any application to operate either by the Corporation or by a new operator. In such a case the Government would have power to require the appropriate Corporation to undertake services on that route; but if the Corporation satisfied the Govern ment that such a service could not be run without loss, the Government must be prepared to give the Corporation such temporary financial assistance as may be reasonable. Assurance of Reasonable Facilities. 37. In order to ensure that the interests of the users of air transport are adequately and continuously safeguarded, it is intended to confer upon an impartial Tribunal jurisdiction to consider complaints as to such matters as the absence of reasonable facilities, the granting of undue preference, and the reasonableness of rates and charges of United Kingdom air lines. Such Tribunal should have power to enforce compliance with its decisions. In the case of complaints relating to overseas services—which are necessarily regulated by inter-Governmental agreement—the decision of the Tribunal must be subject to confirmation by the Minister. Co-operation with Commonwealth and Foreign Air Transport Operators. 38. The Commonwealth routes will be operated in full co-operation with other countries of the British Commonwealth. These routes have already been discussed with other Commonwealth Governments and with the Colonial Office as representing the Colonial Empire. The Commonwealth Govern ments have expressed their desire that reciprocal services from their countries to the United Kingdom shall be operated in parallel with the United Kingdom services to their countries. In order to make this parallel system effective and economical, arrangements are being made as regards facilities at the terminals and along the routes. Provision will also be made for an equitable division of revenue and expenditure where it is agreed that a pooling arrange ment is advantageous. Arrangements for parallel operation will not, of course, exclude—they should, on the contrary facilitate—the ultimate con version of parallel operation into joint operation whenever and wherever the Governments concerned agree that this has become desirable. 39. His Majesty’s Government will welcome the closest co-operation between foreign air line operators running services to the United Kingdom and the Air Transport Corporations set up under the Government plan. Here, too, while parallel operation will probably prevail in the initial phase, the possi bility of running joint services through subsidiary companies in which the foreign operator would participate, is one which in the view of His Majesty’s Government may present great advantages. 40 . It is hoped that the combined training establishment for air crews and ground staff which will be set up in the United Kingdom, and possibly the joint organisation for the overhaul of aircraft may prove of use to other Commonwealth operators and to foreign operators who desire to avail them selves of the facilities offered by these organisations.cm I !■ / co Muscat Civil Air Agreaiaent or 19 £&gt; 4 ? not aware of precise nature of facilitiefc (wUicb were apparently not specified) but they pr esy^nab! v 1 nc 1 ur 5 ed ar*r»r. r.rvetoen t •; y,- &gt; ^ &gt;.b 1 •; r;)i p r&gt;ri I* Provision of Aircraft. 41. It is, of course, the intention of His Majesty’s Government, as it is the desire of the Corporations, that the Corporations shall use British aircraft as soon as they can oe made available. Tne Ministry of Aircraft Production in collaboration with the Brabazon Committee, has already placed orders tor a number ot civil types. In war, when resources are strained and Service demands are paramount the Government must place the orders for aircraft for civil aviation, because tney must control and allocate the priority and dis tribution of all calls upon the resources ot the aircraft industry. But ther^^ must be the closest collaboration between the Department responsible fo^* placing the orders, the user and the producer, so as to ensure that the user gets the type of aircraft that suits the services he is to operate, and that the producer can apply to the needs of the user, the best and latest experience in technical development and in the ingenuity and initiative of design staffs. Air line operators, no less than Air Forces, must have their eyes always on the future and not on the past, save in so far as the experience of the past may point the way to future progress. Arrangements have already been made to bring the new Air Transport Corporations into close collaboration of this kind with the manufacturers of aircraft and the Government Departments concerned. As soon as circumstances permit the Corporations and their sub sidiaries will be free to buy aircraft direct from the manufacturers. 42. In the meantime it is the intention of the Government that in the initial stages where such a course is convenient, the Government shall lease the air craft which they have ordered to the Air Transport Corporations. The Government will also be prepared, in appropriate cases, to consider leasing to other Commonwealth operators and to foreign operators. 43. In framing their air transport policy, the Government have sought to apply to the development and expansion of our own air services, those principles of ordered progress which they have advocated in the international sphere. They are planning to bring into operation as rapidly as the exigencies of war permit, a complete network of Commonwealth services in full co-opera tion with other Commonwealth Governments. They are bringing into partner ship on practical business lines, those elements which, by reason of their experience and organisation, can contribute to the full and rapid development of British air transport. In this way the Government believe that they can best “ meet the needs of the peoples of the world for safe, regular, efficient, and economical air transport ”, and epable British civil aviation, which has had to be subordinated to the supreme war effort, to take its rightful place on the airways of the world.A S Miscellaneous No. 6 (1945) INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION CONFERENCE PART I FINAL ACT AND APPENDICES I-IV Chicago, 7th December, 1944 Presented by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to Parliament by Command of His Majesty LONDON HIS MAJESTY’S STATIONERY OFFICE ONE SHILLING NET Cmd. 6614 WI f CONTENTS Page Final Act ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 2 Appendix I.—Interim Agreement on International Civil Aviation ... ... ... 19 Appendix II.—Convention on International Civil Aviation ... ... ... ... 30 Appendix III.—International Air Services Transit Agreement ... ... ... 54 Appendix IV.—International Air Transport Agreement ... ... ... 57 List of Signatories of Final Act, Agreements amTConvention ... ... 61 [Note.—P art II, which contains Appendix V (drafts of the technical annexes) is not printed.] A 2 41235cc Muscat Civil Ail* Agr©8£iient of j QgAQ t - rp not aware of precise nature pi facility-e'(w’uo ivere apparently not specified) but they presuinab!

CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION Convention on International Civil Aviation, which is attached hereto as Appendix II. INTERNATIONAL AIR SERVICES TRANSIT AGREEMENT International Air Services Transit Agreement, which is attached hereto as Appendix III. INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORT AGREEMENT International Air Transport Agreement, which is attached hereto as Appendix IV. The following resolutions and recommendations were adopted: I PREPARATION OF THE FINAL ACT The International Civil Aviation Conference Resolves: # , That the Secretariat be authorized to prepare the Final Act in accordance with the suggestions proposed by the Secretary-General in Journal No. 34, December 4, 1944, and that the Co-ordinating Committee review the text; That the Final Act contain the definitive texts of the instruments formulated by the Conference in plenary session, and that no changes be made therein at the Final Plenary Session. II DRAFT TECHNICAL ANNEXES Whereas : The largest possible degree of international standardization of practice in many matters is important to safe, expeditious, and easy air navigation; and Whereas : These matters typically involve problems of great variety and complexity, and require that much new ground be explored; and Whereas : Considerable progress has been made, during the discussions of the present Conference, in the development of codes of practice agreed upon as proper by the technicians participating in the discussions, but the time has been too limited, and the number of personnel able to participate directly too small, to permit carrying the discussions to final conviction of the adequacy or correctness of certain of the determinations here made;P) See note on page 1. 13 The International Civil Aviation Conference Resolves: That the drafts of annexes for an international civil aviation convention, which are attached hereto as Appendix Vh 1 ) be accepted by the Conference, upon the bases that: (a) The drafts as now presented shall be accepted by the participating States for immediate and continuing study; (b) They shall be accepted as constituting models of the desirable scope and arrangement of the several annexes; (c) The participating States undertake to forward to the Government of the United States (or to the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization if it shall in the meantime have been established), by May i, 1945, any recommendations which they may have for necessary additions, deletions, or amendments; (d) The Government of the United States (or the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization) will transmit .such suggestions to the other participating States in anticipation of meetings of the technical committees to be established by the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organiza tion for dealing with the subject matter of the various 'documents, such meetings to be held as soon as practicable thereafter for the purpose of ultimate acceptance of the annexes in final form for attachment to a convention. (e) Meanwhile, in so far as the Technical Subcommittees have been able to agree on recommended practices, the States of the world, bearing in mind their present international obligations, are urged to accept these practices as ones toward which the national practices of the several States should be directed as far and as rapidly as may prove practicable. III TECHNICAL PERSONNEL Whereas : The development and maintenance of suitable international standards in matters relating to international air navigation will require constant analysis, by technically qualified personnel, of the development of the pertinent arts and of the various practices existing with respect thereto; The International Civil Aviation Conference Resolves : That the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization, as soon as possible after its organization, should employ in its Secretariat a suitable body of personnel, expert in the fields of aeronautical science and practice in which continuing study will be particularly needed; and that such technically qualified members of the Secretariat should be charged to analyze and report to the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization on problems relating to the drafting of international standards and recommended practices and to conduct and report on such other studies as will promote the safe and efficient conduct of international air transportation. IV METRIC SYSTEM Whereas : A standard system of measurements in all rules and regulations pertaining to air traffic on international and intercontinental airways would greatly con tribute to the safety of these operations; and(Zj -J ii co Muscat Civil Air Agreetaent o not aware of'precise nature of' were apparently not spec if! eel) presumably included arran^etaent f ad liti t hey ee (which '* m •; r&gt;n i*. 14 Whereas : It is considered of high importance that figures used in rules and regulations and other data, with which air crews and other operational personnel have to deal in the preparation of and during flights over various countries, should consist of round figures which can easily be remembered; The International Civil Aviation Conference Resolves ; 1. That in those cases in which it appears impracticable or undesirable , ^ make use of the metric system as a primary international standard, units in publications and codes of practice directly affecting international air navi gation should be expressed both in the metric and English systems; and 2. That the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization shall make further unification of numbering and systems of dimensioning and specification of dimensions used in connection with international air navigation the subject of continuing study and recommendation.* V TRANSFER OF TITLE TO AIRCRAFT Considering : That the sale of aircraft to be used in international operations will render it desirable for the various governments to reach a common understanding on the legal questions involved in the transfer of title: The International Civil Aviation Conference Recommends : That the various governments represented at this International Civil Aviation Conference give consideration to the early calling of an international confer ence on private international air law for the purpose of adopting a convention dealing with the transfer of title to aircraft and that such private air law conference include in the bases of discussions: (a) The existing draft convention relating to mortgages, other real securi ties, and aerial privileges; and (b) The existing draft convention on the ownership of aircraft and the aeronautic register, both of which were adopted by the Comite International Technique d’Experts Juridiques Aeriens (CITEJA) in 1931. VI ROME CONVENTION (MAY 29, 1933) ( 2 ) RELATING TO THE PRECAUTIONARY ATTACHMENT OF AIRCRAFT Considering : That the expeditious movement of aircraft in international commerce is essential in order that the fullest advantage may be derived from the rapid means of communication afforded by aircraft; That the seizure or detention of aircraft where the attaching creditor cannot invoke a judgment and execution obtained beforehand in the ordinary course of procedure, or an equivalent right of execution, affects the expeditious movement of aircraft in international commerce; The International Civil Aviation Conference ( 2 ) 'League of Nations Treaty Series ” No. 4479 (not ratified by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom). 415 Recommends : That the various governments represented at this International Civil Aviation Conference give consideration to the desirability of ratifying or adhering to the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to the Precautionary Attachment of Aircraft, signed at Rome on May 29, 1933, during the Third International Conference on Private Air Law, in so far as such governments have not already ratified or adhered to that Convention. r VII RESUMPTION OF AND CO-ORDINATION WITH THE SESSIONS OF CITEJA Considering : That the Comite International Technique d’Experts Juridiques Aeriens (CITEJA), created pursuant to a recommendation adopted at the First Inter national Conference on Private Air Law held at Paris in 1925, has made considerable progress in the development of a code of private international air law through the preparation of draft international conventions for final adoption ait periodic international conferences on private air law; That the further elaboration of this code of private international air law through the completion of pending CITEJA projects and the initiation or new studies in the field of private air law will contribute materially to the development of international civil aviation: The International Civil Aviation Conference Recommends : 1. That the various governments represented at this International Civil Aviation Conference give consideration to the desirability of bringing about the resumption at the earliest possible date of the CITEJA sessions which were suspended because of the outbreak of war, of making necessary con tributions toward the expenses of the Secretariat of CITEJA, and of appoint ing legal experts to attend the CITEJA meetings; and 2. That consideration also be given by the various governments to the desirability of co-ordinating the activities of CITEJA with those of the Pro visional International Civil Aviation Organzation and, after it shall have come into existence, of the permanent International Civil Aviation Organiza tion established pursuant to the Convention on International Civil Aviation drawn up at Chicago on December 7th, 1944. VIII STANDARD FORM OF AGREEMENT FOR PROVISIONAL AIR ROUTES Whereas : The course of military events will free certain areas of the world from the interruption which the war has caused to civil air traffic; Whereas : The civil transport systems and facilities of many States have been reduced to a level which is far from adequate, but on the other hand there exist wide opportunities for utilizing the airplane, which has demonstrated its efficiency in rendering rapid transportation on a large scale basis, in bringing aid to needy countries and in hastening the return of normal trade and commerce; 41235 A 5I.v 1 i O '*• to Muscat Civil Air Agreement of 19349 t ; .- rr , not aware of precise nature oi facili-tiee (whion, ivere apparently not spec if lea) but they' presumably included arran.^eraentR fnv i c.hnr&gt;n:* v 1 16 Whereas : The possibilities of air transportation are so great and at the same time so unpredictable, that it is desirable to promote early development in this field during a transitional period, in order to obtain practical experience for giving effect to more permanent arrangements at a later date; Whereas : Every State has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory; and Whereas.: It is desirable that there should be as great a measure of uniformity as possible in any agreements that may be made between States for the operation of air services; The International Civil Aviation Conference Recommends : 1. That each State undertake to refrain from including specific provisions in an agreement which grant exclusive rights of transit, non-traffic stop, and commercial entry to any other State or airline, or from making any agreement excluding or discriminating against the airlines of any State, and will terminate any existing exclusive or discriminatory rights as soon as such action can be taken under presently outstanding agreements; 2. That the clauses contained in the draft form of standard agreement hereinafter set out shall be regarded as standard clauses for incorporation in the agreements referred to above, it being understood that the right is reserved to the States concerned to effect such changes of wording as may be necessary in the particular case and to add additional clauses so long as such changes or additions are not inconsistent with the standard clauses, it being further understood that nothing herein shall prevent any State from entering into agreements with airlines of other States provided that such agreements shall incorporate the aforementioned standard clauses to the extent that these may be applicable: Form of Standard Agreement for Provisional Air Routes (1) The contracting parties grant the rights specified in the Annex* 1 hereto necessary for establishing the international civil air routes and services therein described, whether such services be inaugurated immediately or at a later date at the option of the contracting party to whom the rights are granted. (2) (a) Each of the air services so described shall be placed in operation as soon as the contracting party to whom the right has been granted by paragraph (i) to designate an airline or airlines for the route concerned has authorized an airline for such route, and the contracting party granting the right shall, subject to Article (7) hereof, be bound to give the appropriate operating permission to the airline or airlines concerned; provided that the airline so designated may be required to qualify before the competent aeronautical authorities of the contracting party granting the rights under the laws and regulations normally applied by these authorities before being per mitted to engage in the operations contemplated by this Agreement; and * An Annex will include a description of the routes and of the rights granted whether of transit onlv, of non-traffic stops or of commercial entry as the case may be, and the conditions incidental to the granting of the rights. Where rights of non-traffic stops or commercial rights are granted, the Annex will include a designation of the ports of call at which stops can be made, or at which commercial rights for the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers, cargo and mail are authorized, and a statement of the contracting parties to whom the respective rights are granted.41235 A 6 !7 } provided that in areas of hostilities or of military occupation, or in areas affected thereby, such inauguration shall be subject to the approval of the competent military authorities. (6) It is understood that any contracting party granted commercial rights under this Agreement should exercise them at the earliest practicable date except in the case of temporary inability to do so. (3) Operating rights which may have been granted previously by any of the contracting parties to any State not a party to this Agreement or to an ^ airline shall continue in force according to their terms. (4) In order to prevent discriminatory practices and to assure equality of treatment, it is agreed that: (a) Each of the contracting parties may impose or permit to be imposed just and reasonable charges for the use of airports, and other facilities. Each of the contracting parties agrees, however, that these charges shall not be higher than would be paid for the use of such airports and facilities by its national aircraft engaged in similar international services. (b) Fuel, lubricating oils and spare parts introduced into the territory of a contracting party by another contracting party or its nationals, and intended solely for use by aircraft of such other contracting party shall be accorded national and most-favoufed-nation treatment with respect to the im position of customs duties, inspection fees or other national duties or charges by the contracting party whose territory is entered. (c) The fuel, lubricating oils, spare parts, regular equipment and air craft stores retained on board civil aircraft of the airlines of the contracting parties authorized to operate the routes and services described in the Annex shall, upon arriving in or leaving the territory of other contracting parties, be exempt from customs, inspection fees or similar duties or charges, even though such supplies be used or consumed by such aircraft on flights in that territory. (5) Certificates of airworthiness, certificates of competency and licences issued or rendered valid by one contracting party shall be recognized as valid by the other contracting parties for the purpose of operating the routes and services described in the Annex. Each contracting party reserves the right, however, to refuse to recognize, for the purpose of flight above its own terri tory, certificates of competency and licences granted to its own nationals by another State. (6) (a) The laws and regulations of a contracting party relating to the admission to or departure from its territory of aircraft engaged in international air navigation, or to the operation and navigation of such aircraft while within its territory, shall be applied to the aircraft of all contracting parties without distinction as to nationality, and shall be complied with by such aircraft upon entering or departing from or while within the territory of that party. (b) The laws and regulations of a contracting party as to the admission to or departure from its territory of passengers, crew, or cargo of aircraft, such as regulations relating to entry, clearance, immigration, passports, customs, and quarantine shall be complied with by or on behalf of such passengers, crew, or cargo upon entrance into or departure from, or while within, the territory of that party. (7) Each contracting party reserves the right to withhold or revoke a certifi cate or permit to an airline of another State in any case where it is not satisfied that substantial ownership and effective control are vested in nationals of a party to this Agreement, or in case of failure of an airline to comply with the laws of the State over which it operates, as described in Article (6) hereof, or to perform its obligations under this Agreement.to Muscat' Civil Air / not aware of precise were apparently not p r e g u inab 1 v i n c 1 un ed a r&gt; r- a ^ r* a r, n f»rn tm f: p. r- v-, •. m a (8) This Agreement and all contracts connected therewith, shall be regis tered with the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization. (9) [Where desired, here insert provisions for arbitration, the details of which will be a matter for negotiation between the parties to each agreement.] (10) This Agreement shall continue in force until such time as it may be amended, or superseded by a general multilateral air convention, provided, however, that the rights for services granted under this Agreement may be terminated by giving one year’s notice to the contracting party whose air lines are concerned. Such notice may be given at any time after a period c two months to allow for consultation between the contracting party giving notice and the contracting parties served by the routes. The International Civil Aviation Conference Resolves: That the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization, when estab lished, be requested to give consideration to the question of the publication of flight documents and forms in representative languages of areas through which major international air routes are operated. RECOMMENDATION THAT CERTAIN MATTERS BE REFERRED TO The International Civil Aviation Conference Recommends : That the matters on which it has not been possible to reach agreement between the States represented at this Conference, in particular the matters comprehended within the headings of Articles II, X, XI and XII of Document 358 (Draft of a Section of an International Air Convention Relating Primarily to Air Transport, together with Conference Documents 384, 385, 400, 407, and 429, and all other documentation relating thereto, be referred to the Interim Council provided for in the Interim Agreement on International Civil Aviation drawn up at Chicago on December 6, 1944, with instructions to give these matters continuing study and to submit a report thereon with recommenda tions to the Interim Assembly as soon as practicable.

The A pj*i 1^1*94, My dear Sir Geoffrey, Will you please refer to paragraph No.? of my demi-official letter N o.S.601-9/^7, dated the 15th April 1945, on the subject of the visit! of the Sultan to Masirah ?» ?. It appears that Stuart-Lyon had not anticipated being asked any questions on post-war civil air policy, and when he was approached by the Sultan through Hirst for this purpose he signalled to the Regional Director at Karpchi for instructions. ?. Hallows, who did not see the correspondence and was not informed of the Sultan 1 s request until a fev minutes before an interview which eventually took place, gathered from Stuart-hyon that Lloyd-Taylor had replied that while there was no objection to an informal talk the Sultan would have to take up any matters of an official nature with the Consul at Muscat. Halliws asked Stuart-Lyon what he proposed to say, and received the reply that he Intended to give the personal views of Lloyd-Taylor on B.O.A.C. post-war reouire- ments in Muscat, to explain the main points of variance at the Chicago Conference and to answer any questions the Sultan might like to put. Two interfiews took place and the Sultan was, I believe, given the impression that a strategic civil line would be maintained. 4. The Sultan, as you know, pins great hope on the development of civil air routes in his territory and tn view of this, and his obvio us anxiety in the matter, I think it would be a good move to give him copies of the various white-papers published by the Stationery office. should be grateful if copies could be obtained and sent to me. Yours sincerely, Sd.VA.C. Galloway. The Hon f ble Sir Geoffrey Rrior, K.C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

The facilities which tlie B.O.A.C. enjoy at pressnu in Muscat territory are hased solely on the war subsidy with the Sultan and will therefore lapse wlien this comes to an end after the war with Japan is finished. The Government of India in their letter of 24th April (-flagged) have new made certain proposals for the securing of their own post-war requirements in civil aviation from the Sultan. In accordance with the minuting exchanged with the E. &amp; 0. Department below a draft letter to the Civil Aviation Department is now submitted. — H tu ' 2xt * 2 215/4-5 India Office, Whitehall, S.¥.1. ei/$Tj , une, 194-5. Dear Jones, V/ith reference to ny letter No. Nxt*1626/45 of 13th April regarding the question of civil air facilities in Muscat I enclose kth Aiil jhsrevyitha cc^y of a letter from the Government of India in which they si^gest that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf might be authorised to enter into negotiations with the Sultan of Muscat with a view to obtaining the Government of India*s own post-war requirements in connection with civil aviation. You may remember that seme time ago the Sultan expressed the v/ish that he might be informed as far as possible in advance of British post-war civil aviation plans for the South Arabian route, and he was assured that he would be given full time for the examination of any proposition which H,M.G. might have to make (see Political Resident* s telegram T/89 of 12th March and India Office telegram 6533 of 23rd March of which spare copies are enclosed.) The Muscat Civil Air Agreement which lapsed in 1938 Y/as between H.H.G. and the Sultan and in the special circumstances of Muscat you may think it desirable for H.M.G* s requirements in civil aviation matters to be put to the Sultan a.t the same time as those of the Government of India. We should therefore be glad to Anew w/hether you are in a position to give a sufficient indication of this to enable the Political Resident to enter into negotiations for an agreement. Whether such an agreement should this time be made jointly in tho names of H.M.G. and the Government of India is a matter requiring further consideration. The Government of Inaia are of course for civil aviation purposes now a separate international person. Would you please also lot us have your comments on the Maj or H.

The present position as regards the Sultan is described briefly in these letters. The G-overnment of India now suggest that the Political Resident might be authorised to start negotiations for a civil aviation agreement with the Sultan. Presumably this should be in the name of with the G-overnment of India’s requirements specifically covered. I am not sure whether it would be desirable to cover the R.A.F’s military- requirements under the same agreement, and this I think will depend on what exactly the R.A.F. want. The question of what kind of payment should be made to the Sultan for the facilities required will also have to be considered. The next step seems to be to send a copy of the Govern ment of India’s letter to the Air Ministry and ask for their comments, particularly in regard to their own civil' aviation requirements from the Sultan. If it is thought desirable to have a meeting, we could probably get the Political Resident along, since he is now in London on leave. We should be glad to have your comments.External Secretary , &amp; I agree that in the special circumstances of 1'uscat I / it will be desirable for the civil aviation desiderata of H. lr f . G-. and the Government of India to be put forward at the same time. Later developments will presumably show who should be ijm party to the agreement. The Government of India themselves appear somewhat confused on this point (contrast the first sentence of paragraph 4 with paragraph 4(iv))l Possibly, India being for civil aviation purposes a separate international person,it may be nr no inn ' rj for any resulting agreement to be in the names of both H.M.G. and the Governnent of Mia. We shall certainly require the comments of the Civil Aviation Department and the Foreign Office on this case^as well as possibly those of the Air Ministry. The fact that Muscat, perhaps almost alone of the States other than enemy or ex-enemy States, is not a party to^or covered by^any of the Chicago agreements^and should presumably for general political reasons not be encouraged to become one, brings in gather special considerations. In form most of /theT03«io 4tam ^ ^ j tni /on:&gt; '-i 4 .1. I. I V. . ,c.- • »- • &lt; -I C.C ■ * • . Vu &amp;X dota lett hour Off! at t Ext.' the obligations taken on at Chicago are imposed upon the xeceiving dtate and it may be arguable that since the receiving Ctate is not a party Chicago is wholly irrelevant to th^Scase. J It would seem preferable, however, that the Government of Inlia as a party^should act within the spirit of the agreements and this i^ appears they are prepared to do, though whether it is wise to drag references to Chicago into any communications to the Sultan I am not sure. It is also for consideration whether Article III 6 (2) read with Article XIII 1 of the Interim Agreement^to which the Government of Inlia have adhered^imposes upon H.M.G. and the Government of India the obligation of transmitting to the Interim Council copies of agreements with Muscat. 3^ At first sight it would seem that the special rights required^since they are to be on a non-exclusive basis can with one possible exception be reconciled with the Chicago obligations, though no doubt it would be preferable to recast % theWiform in some cases, e.g. it will presumably be the Sultan who executes works and establishes regulations etc., formally /askingasking for our assistance in doing so. I am a little C~ doubtful how far H.M. G-. or the Government of India should actually acquire a 'right' to do these things within the spirit ^^of the Chicago agreements. The exception referred to above is (iv) of the desiderata. I should have thought it quite incompatible v/ith Chicago that any government other than the government of the territory concerned could levy charges from other users of the facilities provided in I.Iuscat^even though these facilities have been provided at the expense of G. or the Government of India. Surely the proper way to handle this point is in connection with any consideration to be paid to the Sultan^which should take account of the fact, for what it may be worth, that an asset of potential value vis-£-vis foreign air lines is being created in pis territory at our expense (though I recognise that he is thereby left with an inducement not to resist other air lines seeking to cross Muscat; Lr this seems inevitable). 4. A further consideration is that^as you are probably aware^ H.M.G. are at the present time feeling very sore with the Americans for their attempts to create^under a military cloak^ aviation assets in Italy and Greece and otter European /co untriest dote loti hour Off! at t Ext.' countries in a way rather similar to that here contemplated. It is true that the burden of the charge is that the Americans may thereby acquire thereafter an exclusive or semi-exclusive position in these countries^ whereas the Chicago agreements provide for poor countries to seek assistance in development from the International Council. I am not sure that what the Government of India seek in xviuscat is in reality so very different and the other pepartments may be conscious of this awkwardness, particularly if any agreement which results from the negotiations has to be registered with the Interim Council. No doubt our special position in Muscat and the fact that it is not a participant c in the Chicago agreements to some extent *i*ould be used to differentiate this case from those; at the same time Muscat is in treaty relations with the U.5.A. and Prance (two of the States' most likely in practice to be interested) and Italy is, of course, not yet a participant in the Chicago agreements* The broad point here is that (ve must be careful, to act in such a way as not to give the Americans in other more important places a pretext for ruthless action in conflict with the t spirit of the Chicago agreements. /On -—i *Cn a small pointam not quite sure what is meant by cabotage in paragraph 4 (i)» The only cabotage traffic * between Karachi and Aden would seem to lie between !. r as4rah and lalalah. I cannot believe that the traffic offering between those spots will be very profitable! C. If it is thought generally desirable to have a meeting perhaps I might accompany you?^■ra. u TS -.z r —Miscellaneous No. 6 ( 1945 ) INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION CONFERENCE PART I FINAL ACT AND APPENDICES I— IV Chicago, 7 th December, 1944 Presented by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to Parliament by Command of His Majesty LONDON HIS MAJESTY’S STATIONERY OFFICE ONE SHILLING NET Cmd. 6614I CONTENTS Final Act Appendix I.—Interim Agreement on International Civil Aviation ...

As a result of the deliberations of the Conference, as recorded in the minutpQ and reports of the respective Committees and Sub-Committees and of the 1 lenary Sessions, the following instruments were formulated: INTERIM AGREEMENT ON INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION asAppendbfT 61116111 ° n International Civil Aviation &gt; which is attached hereto CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION AppendiflT ° n International Civil Aviati &lt;&gt;n, which is attached hereto as INTERNATIONAL AIR SERVICES TRANSIT AGREEMENT Appendi^TlT 1 Ail ServiceS Transit A S reement ’ which is attached hereto as INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORT AGREEMENT Appendix^IV^ ^ Transport A § reem ent, which is attached hereto as The following resolutions and recommendations were adopted: I PREPARATION OF THE FINAL ACT Resolves • ^ n ^ erna ^ ona i Civil Aviation Conference That the Secretariat be authorized to prepare the Final Act in accordanep Secem 4 S r g S 0n a S nfM ^ th 'v S ^‘ary-General in Journal So 3' ecember 4, 1944, and that the Co-ordinating Committee review the text; ^ by^he Confoelefn^Sn^ defi nitive texts of the instruments formulated aT fte Kn^Hen^Sr SeSS, ° n ' and n ° Changes be made Whereas : DRAFT TECHNIC AL ANNEXES in Tm'Tfo P °? Sible degree of international standardization of practice and y 3 13 lmportant t0 sa£e - expeditious, and easy air navigation; Whereas : Whereas :13 ( x ) See note on page i. The International Civil Aviation Conference m SOLVES: • That the drafts of annexes for an international civil aviation convention, which are attached hereto as Appendix V,( 1 ) be accepted by the Conference, upon the bases that: (a) The drafts as now presented shall be accepted by the participating States for immediate and continuing study; (b) They shall be accepted as constituting models of the desirable scope and arrangement of the several annexes; ( c ) The participating States undertake to forward to the Government of the United States (or to the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization if it shall in the meantime have been established), by ilay i, 1945 ’ recommendations which they may have for necessary additions, deletions, or amendments; The Government of the United States (or the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization) will transmit such suggestions to the other participating States in anticipation of meetings of the technical committees to be established by the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organiza tion for dealing with the subject matter of the various documents, such meetings to be held as soon as practicable thereafter for the purpose of u timate acceptance of the annexes in final form for attachment to a convention. (e) Meanwhile, in so far as the Technical Subcommittees have been able to agree on recommended practices, the States of the world, bearing in mmd their present international obligations, are urged to accept these C u a j- ° neS * owar d which the national practices of the several States should be directed as far and as rapidly as may prove practicable. Ill „ r TECHNICAL PERSONNEL Whereas : The development and maintenance of suitable international standards in matters relating to international air navigation will require constant analysis, by technically qualified personnel, of the development of the pertinent arts and of the various practices existing with respect thereto; The International Civil Aviation Conference Resolves : That the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization, as soon as possible after its organization, should employ in its Secretariat a suitable body of personnel, expert in the fields of aeronautical science and practice in which continuing study will be particularly needed; and that such technically ■qualified members of the Secretariat should be charged to analyze and report to the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization on problems relating to the drafting of international standards and recommended practices and to conduct and report on such other studies as will promote the safe and efficient conduct of international air transportation. IV METRIC SYSTEM Whereas : A standard system of measurements in all rules and regulations pertaining to air traffic on international and intercontinental airways would greatly con tribute to the safety of these operations; and14 Whereas : It is considered of high importance that figures used in rules and regulatio^ and other data, with which air crews and other operational personnel have to deal in the preparation of and during flights over various countries, should consist of round figures which can easily be remembered; The International Civil Aviation Conference Resolves: 1. That in those cases in which it appears impracticable or undesirable to make use of the metric system as a primary international standard, units in publications and codes of practice directly affecting international air navi gation should be expressed both in the metric and English systems; and 2. That the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization shall make further unification of numbering and systems of dimensioning and specification of dimensions used in connection with international air navigation the subject of continuing study and recommendation. V TRANSFER OF TITLE TO AIRCRAFT Considering^ That the sale of aircraft to be used in international operations will render it desirable for the various governments to reach a common understanding on the legal questions involved in the transfer of title: The International Civil Aviation Conference Recommends : That the various governments represented at this International Civil Aviation Conference give consideration to the early calling of an international confer ence^ on private international air law for the purpose of adopting a convention dealing with the transfer of title to aircraft and that such private air law conference include in the bases of discussions: (а) The existing draft convention relating to mortgages, other real securi ties, and aerial privileges; and (б) The existing draft convention on the' ownership of aircraft and the aeronautic register, both of which were adopted by the Comite International Technique d’Experts Juridiques Aeriens (CITEJA) in 1931. VI ROME CONVENTION (MAY 29, 1933) ( 2 ) RELATING TO THE PRECAUTIONARY ATTACHMENT OF AIRCRAFT Considering : lhat the expeditious movement of aircraft in international commerce is essential in order that the fullest advantage may be derived from the rapid means of communication afforded by aircraft; That the seizure or detention of aircraft where the attaching creditor cannot invoke a judgment and execution obtained beforehand in the ordinary course of procedure, or an equivalent right of execution, affects the expeditious movement of aircraft in international commerce; The International Civil Aviation Conference ( 2 ) “League of Nations Treaty Series ’’ No. 4479 (not ratified by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom).15 Recommends : A the various governments represented at this International Civil Aviation Conference give consideration to the desirability of ratifying or adhering to the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to the Precautionary Attachment of Aircraft, signed at Rome on May 29, 1933, during the Third International Conference on Private Air Law, in so far as such governments have not already ratified or adhered to that Convention. RESUMPTION OF Considering : VII AND CO-ORDINATION CITEJA WITH THE SESSIONS OF That the Comit6 International Technique d’Experts Juridiques Aeriens (CITEJA), created pursuant to a recommendation adopted at the First Inter national Conference on Private Air Law held at Paris in 1925, has made considerable progress in the development of a code of private international air law through the preparation of draft international conventions for final adoption at periodic international conferences on private air law; That the further elaboration of this code of private international air law through the completion of pending CITEJA projects and the initiation of new studies in the field of private air law will contribute materially to the development of international civil aviation: The International Civil Aviation Conference Recommends : 1. That the various governments represented at this International Civil Aviation Conference give consideration to the desirability of bringing about the resumption at the earliest possible date of the CITEJA sessions which were suspended because of the outbreak of war, of making necessary con’ tributions toward the expenses of the Secretariat of CITEJA, and of appoint ing legal experts to attend the CITEJA meetings; and 2. That consideration also be given by the various governments to the desirability of co-ordinating the activities of CITEJA with those of the Pro visional International Civil Aviation OrganzatW and, after it shall have come into existence, of the permanent International Civil Aviation Organiza tion established pursuant to the Convention on International Civil Aviation drawn up at Chicago on December 7th, 1944. VIII STANDARD FORM OF AGREEMENT FOR PROVISIONAL AIR ROUTES Whereas : The course of military events will free certain areas of the world from the interruption which the war has caused to civil air traffic; Whereas : The civil transport systems and facilities of many States have been reduced to a level which is far from adequate, but on the other hand there exist wide opportunities for utilizing the airplane, which has demonstrated its efficiency in rendering rapid transportation on a large scale basis, in bringing aid to needy countries and in hastening the return of normal trade and commerce; 41235 A 5ro3flia Afam dot lot b 0 U Off at ' Ext / • 3l • 1 . 16 Whereas : The possibilities of air transportation are so great and at the same time sc^ unpredictable, that it is desirable to promote early development in this fieki^ during a transitional period, in order to obtain practical experience for giving effect to more permanent arrangements at a later date; 8 Whereas : Every State has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory; and Whereas : It is desirable that there should be as great a measure of uniformity as possible in any agreements that may be made between States for the operation of air services; The International Civil Aviation Conference Recommends : . ^ ■ That each State undertake to refrain from including specific provisions in an agreement which grant exclusive rights of transit, non-traffic stop, and commercial entry to any other State or airline, or from making any agreement excluding or discriminating against the airlines of any State, and will terminate any existing exclusive or discriminatory rights as soon as such action can be taken under presently outstanding agreements; 2. That the clauses contained in the draft form of standard agreement hereinafter set out shall be regarded as standard clauses for incorporation in the agreements referred to above, it being understood that the right is reserved to the States concerned to effect such changes of wording as may be necessary in the particular case and to add additional clauses so long as such changes or additions are not inconsistent with the standard clauses, it being further understood that nothing herein shall prevent any State from entering into agreements with airlines of other States provided that such agreements shall incorporate the aforementioned standard clauses to the extent that these may be applicable: Form of Standard Agreement for Provisional Air Routes (1) The contracting parties grant the rights specified in the Annex* hereto necessary for establishing the international civil air routes and services therein described, whether such services be inaugurated immediately or at a later date at the option of the contracting party to whom the rights are granted. (2) (a) Each of the air services so described shall be placed in operation as soon as the contracting party to whom the right has been granted by paragraph (1) to designate an airline or airlines for the route concerned has • authorized an airline for such route, and the contracting party granting the right shall, subject to Article (7) hereof, be bound to give the appropriate operating permission to the airline or airlines concerned; provided that the airline so designated may be required to qualify before the competent aeronautical authorities of the contracting party granting the rights under the laws and regulations normally applied by these authorities before being per mitted to engage in the operations contemplated by this Agreement; and * An Annex will include a description of the routes and of the rights granted whether of transit only, of non-traffic stops or of commercial entry as the case may be, and the conditions incidental to the granting of the rights. Where rights of non-trafflc stops or commercial rights are granted, the Annex will include a designation of the ports of call at which stops can be made, or at which commercial rights for the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers, cargo and mail are authorized, and a statement of the contracting parties to whom the respective rights are granted.A 6 41235 provided that in areas of hostilities or of military occupation, or in areas ^a ffected thereby, such inauguration shall be subject to the approval of the ^^ompetent military authorities. (b) It is understood that any contracting party granted commercial rights under this Agreement should exercise them at the earliest practicable date except in the case of temporary inability to do so. ( 3 ) Operating rights which may have been granted previously by any of the contracting parties to any State not a party to this Agreement or to an airline shall continue in force according to their terms. (4) In order to prevent discriminatory practices and to assure equality of treatment, it is agreed that: (a) Each of the contracting parties may impose or permit to be imposed just and reasonable charges for the use of airports, and other facilities. Each of the contracting parties agrees, however, that these charges shall not be higher than would be paid for the use of such airports and facilities by its national aircraft engaged in similar international services. (b) Fuel, lubricating oils and spare parts introduced into the territory of a contracting party by another contracting party or its nationals, and intended solely for use by aircraft of such other contracting party shall be accorded national and most-favoured-nation treatment with respect to the im position of customs duties, inspection fees or other national duties or charges by the contracting party whose territory is entered. (c) The fuel, lubricating oils, spare parts, regular equipment and air craft stores retained on board civil aircraft of the airlines of the contracting parties authorized to operate the routes and services described in the Annex shall, upon arriving in or leaving the territory of other contracting parties, be exempt from customs, inspection fees or similar duties or charges, even though such supplies be used or consumed by such aircraft on flights in that territory. (5) Certificates of airworthiness, certificates of competency and licences issued or rendered valid by one contracting party shall be recognized as valid by the other contracting parties for the purpose of operating the routes and services described in the Annex. Each contracting party reserves the right, however, to refuse to recognize, for the purpose of flight above its own terri tory, certificates of competency and licences granted to its own nationals by another State. (6) (a) The laws and regulations of a contracting party relating to the admission to or departure from its territory of aircraft engaged in international air navigation, or to the operation and navigation of such aircraft while within its territory, shall be applied to the aircraft of all contracting parties without distinction as to nationality, and shall be complied with by such aircraft upon entering or departing from or while within the territory of that party. (6) The laws and regulations of a contracting party as to the admission to or departure from its territory of passengers, crew, or cargo of aircraft, such as regulations relating to entry, clearance, immigration, passports, customs, and quarantine shall be complied with by or on behalf of such passengers, crew, or cargo upon entrance into or departure from, or while within, the territory of that party. (7) Each contracting party reserves the right to withhold or revoke a certifi cate or permit to an airline of another State in any case where it is not satisfied that substantial ownership and effective control are vested in nationals of a party to this Agreement, or in case of failure of an airline to comply with the laws of the State over which it operates, as described in Article (6) hereof, or to perform its obligations under this Agreement.T33WG AfOKl 18 (8) This Agreement and all contracts connected therewith shall be re^k tered with the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization. ^ (?) [Where desired, here insert provisions for arbitration, the details oi which will be a matter for negotiation between the parties to each agreement.] ( I0 ) This Agreement shall continue in force until such time as it mav be amended, or superseded by a general multilateral air convention, provided however that the rights for services granted under this Agreement mav be terminated by giving one year’s notice to the contracting party whose air- hnes are concerned. Such notice may be given at any time after a period of two months to allow for consultation between the contracting partv givine notice and the contracting parties served by the routes. IX FLIGHT DOCUMENTS AND FORMS The International Civil Aviation Conference Resolves: That the Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization, when estab- hshed, be requested to give consideration to the question of the publication of flight documents and forms in representative languages of areas through which major international air routes are operated.

It therefore contains supplementary correspondence determining British civil and military aviation requirements in Oman; the focus of discussion being the airfields at Gwadur [Gwadar], Masirah, Riyan, and Salalah. In the process the file documents a decision to use the Civil Air Agreement as cover for Royal Air Force (RAF) requirements, British civil requirements being minimal. Draft copies of the Muscat Civil Air Agreement can be found on folios 196-212 and 344-362, while the text of the final agreement – signed in 1947 – can be found on folios 158-176.Two copies of the
                           International Civil Aviation Conference: Final Actwith appendices have been included in the file as a result of discussion over the extent that the Muscat Civil Air Agreement should be along the lines of the Chicago Air Convention.Two additional topics are covered as a result of commitments made to the Sultan of Muscat as part of negotiations for the Civil Air Agreement: the supply of weapons and ammunition to the Sultan by the British Government, and the procurement of motor vehicles (lorries and tractors) of British manufacture for purchase by the Sultan. The latter commitment was in lieu of supplying the Sultan with US dollars for purchasing vehicles directly from the United States. Some correspondence with the Ford Motor Company Limited at Dagenham, Essex, has been included in relation to the purchase of tractors. Details of vehicle specifications can be found amongst the correspondence.The file also includes communications between Air Headquarters (Iraq), Air Headquarters (Aden), and the Air Ministry, in December 1946 discussing the feasibility of measures suggested by the latter to reduce the maintenance costs of local airfields: Masirah, Riyan, and Salalah.The main correspondents are as follows: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Charles Geoffry Prior, William Rupert Hay, and Arnold Crawshaw Galloway), the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat (Andrew Charles Stewart), officials of the Air Ministry, officials of the India Office (the Commonwealth Relations Office from August 1947), officials of the Ministry for Civil Aviation (M W Low), officials of the Ministry of Supply, officials of the War Office, and officials of the External Affairs Department for the Government of India.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Supply</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>AHQ, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Gwadur Aerodrome</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Masirah Aerodrome</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Lorries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Landing grounds</topic></subject><subject><topic>Muscat Civil Air Agreement (1947)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Tractors</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent and Consul, Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Royal Air Force</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Commonwealth Relations Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Overseas Airways Corporation</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Civil Aviation</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>War Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>AHQ Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Civil aviation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Weapons</topic></subject><subject><topic>Ammunition</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00020b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
