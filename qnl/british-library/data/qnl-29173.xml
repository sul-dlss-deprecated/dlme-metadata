Hitherto, such notification has been published in the 'Gazette of India' but with the transfer of power, and the appointment of such officers now resting with H.M.G. in the U.K., Mr. Reed fgels that this would no longer be appropriate. This seems clearly right. He wonders whether the 'Lon3on Gazette' will now be the proper channel for notifying such assumptions of legal powrs. I have no strong views on this question and see no reason for disagreeing with Mr Reed*s tentative view. He wondered whet lie r Pol. Dept, has any precedents in mind and tells me that he saw a reference in a recent 'London Gazette' to the appointment of High Court Judges (in India?).

Sd/- H. Weightman, Secretary to the Government of IndiaMr. Donalds oru {on return) Sir Paul x&amp;trio^has spoken to rae aoout ills note below and has agreed that a decision to be taken on this should aimit your return* Meancriiiie I give my own corouent s below. The present position is that the Cousnonwealth ielations Office are maintaining responsibility for the Persian Gulf until 1st April, when the Foreign Office will take over. This was the result of a Cabinet decision tauten wlien it was thought that the handing caver of power would be in June, 194&amp; It lias not been iought necessary to make any change in view of the ante-dating of the handing over though the point has not escaped notice lie re. The main advantage of maintaining the existing position until the end of March is on administrative grounds. The Political Resident’s budget is being borne on the India and Burma Services Vote for the financial year, 19A7A&amp; and if responsibility vere now transferred to the Foreign Office it vould have to be arranged for tiie cost to be borne on the Foreign Office Vote for the remaining few months. e are also still in direct correspondence with the Governments of India and Pakistan on certain questions and if responsibility were transferred to the Foreign Office we should still have to act as the channel for such correspondence. On the other hand the disadvantages of maintaining the present position are (a) it is hardly in accordance with its proper functions that the Cacs.iOnwealth Relations Office shoulc deal with the Persian Gulf and (b) other parties such as the U.3. Government might criticise tne position on the grounds that we are treating the Gulf States as within the Common wealth whereas they are not in fact in that position. As regards (a) we may agree that the position is anomalous. mewer the anomaly matters, however, is for higher authority to say. I should doub': nyself whether our / responsibilityresponsibility for the J/ersi&amp;n Ckilf is likely to engender any friction with the Goverrments of India and iakistan. •There are certainly some points in which our interests are not quite identical, but IUM.G. are representing tlie interests of India and Pakistan in the Gulf for the time being and taose Governments seen so far to have been quite co-operative, e.g. they have lent us subordinate staff which has been of the greatest value. As regards (b) it seems to me that if aiy States such as the U#S. criticises the position we have a perfectly good answer in that the Foreign Office are taking over in April next and in ary cane it is the concern of H.M.G, alone which of Is Departnents handles the matter. So far as the Gulf States themselves are concerned there lias been no suggestion of criticism and in fact the Sheikh of Bahrein actually mentioned his preference for being under the Colonial Office rather than the Foreign Office presumably on the grounds that the Colonial Office were more likely to stand up for his interests as against his larger neighbours. is! With reference to the last sentence of Sir Paul Patrick's note the adrai istration of the Persian Gulf Orders is really &gt; through the rolitical resident, the phrase' Secret ary of State' which appears in the Orders is defined therein as 'one of His lajesty’s Principal Secretaries of State' which definition of course covers both Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations and Foreign Affairs. W e /Mr, Harrison. The draft telegram and express letter seen, so far as I cai judge, all right; and may issue* hut wita reference to paragraph if of t ie express letter (I cannot find the internal Department letter cited), X mx disturbed at the prospect that the Comnionvjealth Relations Office through handling the relations with the Gulf States saould be brought into relations productive of friction wit.-i the Governments of India and Pakistan* This role seems quite outside the normal functions of G*K*0* The Gulf States are not part of the British Commonwealth and relations with them would seem to involve a control quite foreign to the conceptions applying to our wore elsewhere* I had supposed that, on the tenminar tion of the link with the hxteraal /iffairs Department of Government of India, the Foreign Office would continue our relations with the Gulf States and adninister the Orders-in- Council* I thought tiiat the present set-up might have been intended as merely transitional at the time when it was anticipated that India was remaining united and leaving the Commonwealth* Has it been considered in relation to the existing situation in which in other respects we are dealing in C*R*w* with self-governing components of the Camonwealth? Is it contemplated that the administration of the Orders through C.R*0* will continue indefinitely?• \ Under-Secretary of State, The attached papers are concerned with the revisions to the Persian G-ulf Orders-in-Council made necessary 'by the transfer of administration there from the G-overnment of India to H.M.G. as from 1st April, 1947 and by the subsequent constitutional changes in India. For a general view of the problems involved you might care to see the noting at A, Mr. Beckett's letter of 27th February, the subsequent noting at X and the note immediately below the drafts. The position now is that we have got a revised draft of the Trucial States Order-in-Council worked out in consultaticr between Sir Kenneth Kemp, the Foreign Office and this Department and are now proposing to forward it to the Political Resident to consider and to ask him if^using it as a model^he will let us have revised drafts of the other four Orders-in-Council. These can then be issued here as soon as may be. Until the revised Order-in-Council can be issued there will be one or two loose ends left but these do not appear to amount to very much. The most important point seems to be the replacement of the Governor-General in Council by the Secretary of State as the authority confirming death sentences. In point of fact, however, there have been no such sentences for several years and the Legal Adviser, agrees that it will be all right until the revised Orders-in- Council can be issued.

In this event the Article should be amended to provide for ohis since Bahrein is not in H#H. Dominions. (c) Article 88(i). Do you consider that there is any point in retaining this? 2f.

My dear Donaldson, M' ^ ut fc&gt;m A My most sincere apologies for the very long delay in answering your queries about the Persian Gulf Orders in Council. We agree with you that the besT~’pTan~ woulh he ‘TTT'l &gt; epeal the existing five Orders and replace them by new u rders for the two purposes which you mention. I went through the Trucial States w rder, 1946, with the amendments in it which you enclosed, and the only point I had was really precisely the same one raised by Hay in the note attached to your letter of July 22nd, namely that we must either have some general clause specifying that all references to courts, laws, districts, etc., in India should be courts, laws, etc., as they existed immediately before t:ie 15th August, 1947, or else we must introduce th«^ dateaf in each of the various relevant provisions. As regards the Affect on these Orders of Section 18(l) of the Indian Independence Act, I feel that if the only real difficulty is that which you indicate in connexion with the Confirmation of Death Sentences, it is hardly worthwhile taking ’two bites at the cherry’ and we flight as well leave the matter until we can bring outy£omplete revision of the Orders.

Act. 40 th the Indian Air Force)^ ^7 iT‘\‘***~* M y *| ^ k i Trucial States Order-in-Gouncil I -would suggest that before this particular Order is amended a decision should be reached whether the Political Officer is to be treated in future as an independent Political Agent. 2 . I would also suggest that it would save a number of amendments if a clause were inserted early in the Order to the effect that all references to Courts, laws, Provinces, districts, etc. in India should be read as references to Courts, etc. as they existed | 5 n the 15th August, 19if7. 3 . I have the following more detailed comments to make. ' (i) Article 8 (c). Unless a general clause is inserted as proposed in paragraph 2 'on 15th August, 1947' should be substituted for 'on the date of the commencement of this Order'* as the new Order is not likely to be created before 15th August. The above remark applies to similar amendments in other Articles e.g. 11(1). (ii) Article 14, 3rd line. 'Any law in force in India on 15th August. 1947'. (iii) Article 15(1) lines 7-8. 'A district in the Province of Bombay as constituted on 15th August, 1947'• (iv) Article 17* I do not know if use has ever been made of a similar provision in other Orders-inrCouncil. The Political Resident might be asked if the Article could safely be omitted or alternatively if it will suffice, so far as the Trucial States are concerned if provision is made for the trial of offenders at Bahrein. (v) Article 20. I suggest that provision should be made for convicts from the Trucial States to be imprisoned in Bahrein (if the Bahrein Government agree) as, so far as■■■■BMHHVMN - ■ ■ ' I am aware, there is no prison which we could recognise in the Trucial States. The Article should be amended to provide for this as Bahrein is not in His Majesty^ dominions. • (vi) Article 2?(iv). “High Court in British India as constituted on 15th August. 19A7 W &gt; (vii) Article 30. 'If done in British India on 15th August, 194-7 would have been an offence against the law at that• time in force in British India*.

With regard to the legal protection of Indian nationals and their interests I will consider the area covered by each Order in Council separately# I would hov/ever preface ray remarks by saying that except at Muscat I consider it will make very little difference whether (a) British and Indian represent ation is completely separated or (t^) Indian interests for some time continue to be looked after by British representatives# I am doubtful if any Gkilf Ruler will readily agree to an Indian representative having separate jurisdiction over his own nationals and from the general point of view tne objection to such an arrangement is that it would make it almost impossible for us to refuse a similar privilege to other foreigners and particularly the Americans# * „ g 3# The position in the areas covered by the various Orders in Council is as follows:-; BAHRAIN # Tiie Political Agent has jurisdiction over all foreigners. Unless any special arrangements are made to give an Indian representative jurisdiction over Indian nationals - which course as previously stated I do not recommend - he will continue to exercise jurisdiction over Indians when India becomes independent in the same way as he does at present# There are a considerable number of Indian nationals in Bahrain both in the bazaar and in the Oil Company's camp# If as will almost certainly be the case the Indian Codes continue to be enforced Indians will have the benefit of being subject to a lav/ with which they are familiar# I would also suggest that as a kind of safeguard for Indians in legal matters the Political Agent should continue to have on his staff an Indian assistant who will be empowered to try cases as at present# KU /AIT# The position here is that all British Subjects and non-Moslem foreigners are subject to the jurisdiction of the Political Agent# Should India leave the British Conmonwealth Indian Moslems will automatically become subject to the jurisdiction of the Shaikh# If it is considered desirable the Shaikh could be asked to permit the Political Agent to continue to exercise jurisdiction over Indian Moslems though no gaurantee can be given that he would agree to this# The great majority of Indians in Kuwait are employed by the Oil Company and there are very few in the Bazaar# The amount of litigation in which Indians are involved is extremel 3 r small. During the whole of only two cases were tried under the Order in Council# QATAR. The legal position is the same as at Kuwait an3 a similar approach in respect of Indian Moslems could if necessary be made to the Shaikh# Practically speaking the only Indians in Qatar are empltoyed by the Oil Company and live in its camp and there is not much likelihood of their becoming involved in litigation# TRUSLAIj COAST# As in Balirain all foreigners are subject to the jurisdiction of the Political Agent# Tnere are very few Indians living on the Trucial Coast and the Political Officer, Trucial Coast can I think be trusted to continue to afford them adeqi?^r^)rotection even when India leaves the British Commonwealth# MUS CAT. Here the Political Agent possesses jurisdiction over British Subjects only/ /« ft only and when Indian nationals cease to be British Subjects tney will no longer be subject to t ie jurisdiction of the Political Agent* The present treaty is not due to lapse until 195 ^ while it remains in ^ ce it would appear that India has the right to appoirit her own Consul with, jurisdiction over Indian nationals* For as long as India remains within the British Commonwealth it is suggested that even if a separate Indian Consul is appointed it would be simpler and more economical to allow the Political Agent to exercise jurisdiction over Indian nationals as he does at present* To set up a separate court for the Indian Consul would presumably involve special legislation in India e.g. an enactment some- rl thing on the lines of the British Foreign Jurisdiction Act and also a certain amount of expense* If it is desired that the Political Agent should exercise jurisdiction over Indian nationals after India has left the Commonwealth and until the expiry of the present Treaty it Would be -necessary to obtain the Sultan's concurrence and for special provision to be made in the Muscat Order in Council. If India negotiates a new treaty with the Sultan either before or on the expiry of the 1939 Ti'eaty the nature of t .e jurisdiction if any to be exercised by the Indian Consul over Indian nationals will be a matter for discussion between the Government of India and the Sultan. He may not yeadily agree to grant such jurisdiction. ; Indian interests in Muscat are considerable, most of the trade is in the hands of Indians, either Hindus who still maintain a close connection with India or Khojas who have been more or less absorbed into the country. There are also many Indians both Hindus and *Agha Khanis 3. , fc G-wad ur •n. ■TUDICIAL ARR AH OEM F.MT B. Amendments to the various orders in Council, consequent on the transfer, are primarily matters for the Legal Authorities of His Majesty's Government. It is presumed that the Govt, of India will be considered in respect of Indian interests. Should the Political Resident have any comments to make, however, they will be welcomed. In particular v/e should be glad to have the Politr'cal Resident 1 s views as to whether any, and if so what, measures may be needed to ensure adequate legal protection of Indian nationals and their interests • (a) in the event of complete separation of British and Indian representation in the Gulf and (b) in the event of Indian interests continuing for some time to be looked after by British representatives.- © 'British aircraft' mo&lt;ins an aircraft registered linder tlie law of any port of His } ajesty *3 dofninione, protectorates, protected states or taimdatedterritories, otijer tiian Koweit, Baiirein and Qatra*. according to tiie practice followed in tiie oxe^'cise of such jurisdiction by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay on trie date of tno com enceraent of tills Order.(a) Affect tli ,ast o ^:tJj m o: t .t Order or any appointment made, or ;ir$r right, title, o ligation, or liability accrued, or tlie validity or invalidity of a yt ..in ; done or stiffei’ed under t.mt Order, befoi.’e t.ie ma in,; of t.iia O-xler; (b) Interfere \ 7 ith t.ie institution or prosecution of any proceedin^^ or action, criminal or civil, in respect of any offence conn :itted against or forfeiture incurred or liability accrued under or in consequence of any provisio of t.oat Order or any regulation oonfirraed by any such Order or made thereunder; (c) Take away or abridge any pr'otection or benefit given or to be enjoyed in re 1 ation thereto* ( 2 ) (3) lotwithotanding t ie repeal of the Order aforesaid, ;all rules and regulations ap roved or confirmed by or under such Order so repealed shall continue rmd be as ii? biiis Order iiad not been made; but so that t::c sar.ie raoy be revoked, altered, or otlierwise dealt with unc^er this Order, as 1‘ trey had been n .id under tills Order.

We have been considering Beckett's letter of 2/th February, E, 992 / 165/91 and this letter is the outcome of work which has been done^in consultatiorJwitJi our Legal Adviser^on the lines suggested in Beckett's letter. have come to the conclusion that the simplest x^lan would be to produce revised drafts of each of the five Orders-in- Gouncil (Bahrein 1913 , Koweit 1935 , Qatar 1939, Muscat 1939 and Trucial States 194^) , / forI fijb (p-l for the .purposes of transferring 93S&gt; functions from the Indian, authorities- to the Secretary ,*o^ State ana^^-providu^ for the application pf Indian law* as it Cov--^ will stand on the date wnen tue Orders &amp;&amp;+ LvvC» ^ i.iju.rd-'but v/it iout amendments •which may be made^in the nature. At a later stage we shall probably have to consider a further revision of the older Orders to bring them into line Y/it-i,more modern practice. . , As a first step we have tried our hard at i 1 od j of the Trucial States Order ^9** which is the raost up-to-date of the f ive^ and which probably requires the least amendment £'J * , I enclose a cop^' of this redraft f together with / a note on some^points rry mI. i jj. ■■tj-k j i j mm § t which / you may like to consider before we send the draft out to the Political Resident for his observations. When we do this, we might suggest to him that he should produce drafts /of. t 1 i ■ - ' of the other four Orders similarly adapted on the model of the Tracial States Order. On receipt of these drafts \ve might submit all five to the Privy Council and then consider what further amendments should be made in the earlier Orders to bring them up to date. (*|4) E. F. DONALDSON' NOTE ON IHai T r TRUGIAL 3i^E3 ORDER 1. ^l.j~oeals The Legal Adviser, India ice considers that although B a right of appeal to the l'ri\£ r Council must ultimate!^’' be. provided, it might be better to leave it alone for the moment as there has been no such right hitherto - not even a right of appeal to the Bomba,/ High Court. He fears that the specific grant of a right to appeal might lead to all sorts of frivolous and delaying appeals. In a proper case parties could even now apply to the Privy Council for special leave without specific provision. 2. Anhlication of Indian Law (a) The Indian Post Office Act 1898 might be added to the schedule, as there is already one Post Office established on the Trucial Coast, another is in contemplation, and it is intended that the Indian Post and Telegraph Dej^artment should be asked to continue the present administrotion until the British Post Office can take over next year. (b) The Provincial Insolvency Act, 1920 might replace the last item in the schedule. (c) Reference in the schedule to the Indian Lerchant Shipping Act, 1923 might read as in the Muscat Order-in-CounciL 1939 os follows:- 'So much of Part IV of the Indian Kerchanf Shipping Act, 1923 (Act XXI of 1923; excepting sub-section (3) of Section 213* as relates to pilgrim ships'. (d) Contempt of Court - Some amendment of Article 27(1 )(A; where the reference is to a High Court in British India will be required. /(e)V (e) Trade Harks, etc. - Article 30 should be amended so as to bring it into line with Article 11(3;. 3* D_ate of Gcgn.ienceuent (see Article 92) „ I presume that it would be sufficient to oublish the ruer in the ^ondon G-azette and to provide that it shall come m,-j force either on publication or as soon thereafter as the period during which a prayer for annulment can be move.,; m eitner House of Parlianent has expired. IkHLease see the Ifote by Legal Adviser below, together with his suggested amendment for the revision of the Trucial States' Order-in-Coun cil- s attach a Draft Trucial States Order amended on the linex suggested by Sir Kenneth Kemp* I suggest that this should ix&gt;w be submitted to Mr. Pitzmaurice in the Foreign Office who will no doubt give a more detailed consideration to some of the technical points noted by Sir Kenneth as well as to the suggestions made by Mr. Beckett in his letter of the 27th February (SET .472/47). Some of the smaller points to which consideration might be given are:- (l) The Schedule. (a) The Indian Best Office Act 1898 might be added. There is already a Post Office at Dubai(and there may shortly be another at Sharjah?) (b) The Provincial Insolvency Act 1920 might replace the last item in the Schedule^and the reference to the Indian Merchant Shipping Act 1923 might be amended to read as in the Muscat Order-in-Council 1939. These two refinements were introduced in the Muscat Order of 1939 and the opportunity might now be taken to make the necessary changes in the Trucial States Order.( 2 ) Definition of Judicial Assistant, A revised definition was introduced in the Muscat Order of 1939 so as to make the Secretary to the Resident an ex office Judicial Assistant, This definition properly modified,might now he introduced into the Truoial States' Order# (3) Amendments may he necessary to deal with the following references:- British India (Article 27 and Article 30)$ British India*Law (Article 57); Bombay (Article 48)* With regard to the date of commencement of this and the other revised Orders-in-Council, the situation, as I see it, is this:- As from 1st April 1947 have taken over the responsibility for Administrative Control in the Culf • It is therefore desirable that the revised Orders-in- Council should be brought into effect as soon as possible. Nevertheless,until the date of the Transfer of Power in India the Indian Authorities referred to in the present Orders will continue to exist f and it seems unlikely that any real embarrassment will be caused because of the circumstances of this transitional period. It seems to me that we have thus been given a few months of grace in which without further reference to the Government of India we can issue new Orders-in-Council to take account of the situation as it is now in theory and must be in practice after the date of the Transfer of Power# — As JU*/ v VMr» Mentenu V r Attached hereto is a suggested revision of the Truci al States O-in-C to take the place of the present Order* Although it is, I think, fairly intelligible, it does not seem to me a wholly satisfactory way of laying down the law of the States - but it will anyhow serve the purpose of the Foreign Office if they want to see what it would look like* But ^itjis difficult to see what alternative there is 0 As to appe a ls, I note that Lir.Beckett says 'there must ultimately be a right of appeal to the P.C*' I have not inserted any article in the present draft, as I am inclined to think it might be better to leave it alone for the moment. They # have got on very well without such a right so far, - not even having a right to appeal to the Bombay High Court* The specific grant of a right of appeal now might, I fear, lead to all sorts of frivolous and delaying appeals* Parties could, I presume, always - even now - apply to the P.C. for special leave, and would, in a proper case, obtain it* K.

Note : As to sub-Article (l)(a)(ii), I have before conmented on what, I think, is the mistaken ('h- r ) wording of this Clause in cases where in fact the Sheikh has consented to His Majesty's jurisdiction in the case of all foreigners. In such cases I think the Clause should stop at the word 'Order” as otherwise it gives the erroneous impression that some foreigners are, in fact, excluded. Stet. Substitute (l).

Mr, Donaldson has asked me to prepare a draft Order- in-Council which would have application to all the Persian Oulf otates, and which would specify such changes as are necessary for the puroose of eliminating references in the existing Orders to Indian authorities and Indian Courts. I have therefore prepared the attached draft, I shewed this draft yesterday to Mr, Beckett of the Foreign Office, His reaction was that it would be better to prepare fresh Orders-in-Council to take the place of the existing ones. He did not have time to’study all these papers in detail, but I put to him the view expressed in my note dated 19th April, and I think he agreed generally with this view.

I have coripared the various Orders-in-Gouncil relating to Bahrein, Kuwait, Qatar, the Trucial States and Kuscat, and I have considered the preparation of a general Order-in-Gouncil applying to all these Shaikhdoms* The following points should be noted:- (1) The jurisdiction at present exercised by is not Uniform in extent throughout the various Shaikhdoms* (2) Many of the regulations embodied in the Orders in Council need to be adapted separately to the local conditions of each Shaikhdonu ( 3 ) It may later be necessary to obtain the agreement of the Shaikhs to some of the provisions to be embodied in the new Order* The appearance of a general Order-in-Council applying to all the Shaikhdoms might give rise to much suspicion and unnecessary confusion* In view of these complications I think it will be necessary to have separate Orders as at present, adapting the regulations to local conditions, but the same general pattern could be followed for Bahrein, Kuwait, Qatar and the Trucial States. This pattern could be adapted from^r present Trucial States Order (as being the latest and most up-to- date of the Orders-in-Gouncil) with some possible modifications as suggested in the following memo randum. I would, therefore, suggest that a draft Order-in-Govmcil for the Trucial States should first be prepared as a model and that this new Order should then be adapted to the conditions of Bahrein, Kuwait and Qatar.In the attached memorandum I indicate what seem to be the principal, considerations involved in such a revision of the existing Orders-in-CounciL I think we should get these points clear from the outset, especially those dealt with in Part I.

Powle's d.o. letter 116-S dated 13th February, 1936# ( All the Orders apply, of course, to British subjectSjbut they are at variance in the way in which jurisdiction is extended to: (a) foreigners, and (b) the subjects of the other Arab Shaikhdoras in the Gulf.

(a) The Order applies only to non-kuslim foreigners, (b) The subjects of the other Arab Shaikhdoms are not treated as British Protected Persons, i.e. they come within the jurisdiction of the Shaikh. It should be noted, however, that these subjects are not at present excluded in the definition of pZ British Protected Person. Theory would, therefore, , seem to be at variance with practice and some v amendment is called for. 2. Article 8(l)(a)(iij . The Trucial States Order reverts to the wording of the Bahrein Order. It was probably felt that this wording was best suited to meet the special conditions of the Trucial States. But as .a general fZ '7*1*1/35 model, the wording in the Kuwait and Qatar Orders t&lt;Cj would seem to be better, i.e. 'Foreigners within the limits of this Order'. 3. Article 8(l(a)(iiij . JLciy C 9 ) . ■ fAv/f U&gt;-t^ eJer*&lt; 7 . This article appears in the Bahrein and Kuwait Orders, but not in the Orders relating to Qatar and the Trucial States ( unrf i nn tint ) . It is for consideration whether this point should be included in any future Order. Part/w 2 ./ pZ 3 fiV Jt CW ez Ti'ilJ} PART II. IAW TO HE APPLIED. The Kuwait, Qatar and Trucial States Orders are already substantially identical and the Bahrein Order which is very much out of date may well be brought into line with the others. Two points may be noted about the schedule to the Orders. (1) There seems no reason why the Indian Corapan/ Act, 1913&gt; should not now apply to Bahrein as to all the other Shaikhdoms. (See also Part VI Registration of Companies). (2) The Indian Post Office Act, 1898, does not at present apply to Qatar or the Trucial States (see Political Resident’s Express Letter 358-S dated 9th May, 1938). It is for consideration in the light of the future organisation of postai services in the G-ulf if this Act should now be made to apply to all the Shaikhdoms. PART III. CRIMINAL MATTERS. Here again there seems no reason why the Bahreir Order should not be brought into line with the others. 1. Article 31 of the Bahrein Order (Observance of Treaty Stipulations between the Shaikh and H.M.G. ; does not appear in any of the other Orders, and may well be droo-oedi2« Article 32 of the Trucial States Order (Seditious Publications) should be made to apply to Bahrein. PART IV. CIVIL MATTERS. The Bahrein Order should be brought into line with the others by the addition of Articles 45 to 47 of the Trucial States Order (Probate Regulations and application of the Foreign Jurisdiction (Probates) Order in Council 1935)* PART V. MIXED CASES 1. The various Orders would seem to require separate drafting in this part so that the procedure for dealing with criminal and civil cases may be adapted, as at present, to suit the local conditions in each Shaikhdom. It is for consideration if the arrangements set out in the Trucial States and Qatar Orders would suit the local conditions in Bahrein and Kuwait. 2. It may be noted in particular that all the Orders except Kuwait refer to the existence of a 'Joint Court' composed of the Political Agent and the Shaikh. It is for consideration if provision can now be made for a Joit Court in Kuwait. PART/PAI^T VI, REGISTRATION. Articles 6? to 73 of the Trucial States Order (Registration of Companiesj should be made to apply to Bahrein (see Part II - Indian Conpanies Act 1913). PART VII. MISCELLAIjEOUS PROVISIONS . 1. Article 74 of the Trucial States Order (Transfer of Property) should be made to apply to Bahrein. 2. Articles will be required repealing the previous Orders in Council (see Article 90 Koweit Order-in-Council).( /y/* 5 j NO Z ON mi MUSCAT ORD^R IN OQUNCIL 1939 The Muse t Order in Council takes account of the Anglo-lusec t Coannercial Treaty of 1939, anc thesrefore^ differs in points of detail from the other Persian Gulf Orders in Council. It 3 revision should not be a difficult matter once the proposed revision of the Trucial States Order in Council has been completed. A draft Order for Muscat might then be prep red based on the existing Order and incorporating such nrvr features as may be considered desirable. I have compared the existing Muscat and Trucial States Orders and the main points which seem to deserve attention at this stage are noted below. It is possible that in one or two points the present Kuscat Order in Council may be superior to the present Trucial States Ordex* (e.g. Articles 11 (2) 29(iv)). These matters might be considered in conjunction wiuh the proposed revision of the Orders in Council relating to the Trucial States and other Arab Sheikhdoms. Sxtent of jurisdiction 1. In general the Sheikh exercises jurisdiction over all forei ners except those in the regular servi-e of the Political Igent. In r.spect of criminal matters the Sheikh also exercises jurisdictic over foreigners in the regular service of the Politics Agent (Articles 3(l)(a)(\jj and 17(3)). 2. Subjects of the other Arab Sheikhdoms are excluded from the definition of British protected person/person. Notwithstanding this fact it would appear that In practice the subjects of these Sheikhdoms ax-e treated as British protected persons - i.e. they cone within the jurisdiction of the Order (see Sir T. Fowle’s d.o. letter 116-S dated 13th February 1936). Theoxy, therefore, se ms to be at variance with practice, and it is for consideration if some amendment is called 'or (this seems to be the Foweit situation in reverse;. Law to be applied 1. Article 11(2) does not specify any particular adaptations or modifications to the application of the Indian Lderchant Shipping Act 1923» the Indian Christian Marriage ct 1872 and the Births Deaths and Marriages Kegistration Act 1886. 2. The chednle makes specific mention of the Provincial Solvency Act 1920, and adopts a slightly different formula in referring to the Indian Merchant Shipping Act 1923. / These features are peculiar to the .uso&amp;t ^&gt;2. Order in Council and result from amendments suggested by the Government of India in 1939. It is for consideration whether they should also be incorporated in the revised Orders for the other Arab Sheikhdoms. Article 29(iv) (Trucial Spates Order Article 27(^H The words 'or as a libel on such Coart or the . ^ Judges thereof, or the administration of justicei*; 71 which appear in the corresponding Articles of all the other Persian Gulf Orders have been omitted from the Muscat Order. These words were dropped during the revision of 1939 on the ground that 'they seem to involve a somewhat unnecessax’y and unwise extension of the carefully limited powers of summary punishment for contempt, and do not relate to axything which Indian Law recognises as punishable if done in relation to a High Court in British India'. Presumably this argument still hold good, and it is, tlierefore, for consideration whether this amendment should not now be incorporated in the other Persian Gulf Orders. UmJiCoiuricientiu.1 The Reuiaeney, Buehire, «he 13th February 1936 1)«Q» iiQ. 116-3 oi* 1936. My dear Glauson, Could you please rexer to the laet two aentenoes of paragraph 1 of your demi-official letter i&lt;o. F• ^• 7185/35, dated the 14th October 1935, on the juridical position of subjects of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf vis-a-vis the Rulers of other similar States The position can be summarised as follows:- - Bahrain. (1) Subjects of other Arab States in the Gulf are juridically treated as British protected persons, i.e. they come under the Political Agent not tne Shaikh. It would appear that when the Political Agent issued the notice referred to in paragraph 2 of India Office letter ho. P.d. 7185 covering all foreign subjects, it should presumably only have covered ataris and hejdis (Saudi subjects;. But, as in practice, jurisdiction over foreign subjects and British protected persons has boon exercised for many years by the Political Agent without any objection from the present Shaikh, there would hardly seem any necessity now to raise the question of our right to this jurisdiction. (2) Subjects of Kuwait, Muscat, ^atar, and Trucial Shaikhdoms are not registered as British protected persons, because for the purposes of registration, as opposed to jurisdiction, they have not been regarded as “British subjects”, although the term includes British protected persons (see Article Esquire, 2/ .ia Office, London.S (1) of 'Tiie Bahrain (Amendment) Order in Counoil, 1922' and in the definition in Article 4 of 'The Bahrain Order in Counoil, 1913'). As far as I am aware, no person in these categories has ever uaked to be registered as a British protected person, though they come under the political Agent if involved in civil or criminal proceedings. *Arvai t . Individuals in sluestion are not treated as British protected persona i.e. they come unner the haikh not the Political Agent - vide fliCLson's telegram ho. 295 of 7th October 19o5 to me, repeated to Secretary of otate for India under nis ho. 296.

It seems to us that the revised Qriers for Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and the Trucial States eeuld follow the same general pattern and that this pattern oouid be adapted from the present Trucial States Order (as being the latest and most up to date of the Orders in Council)« In conjunction with the Foreign Office we^therefore propose to draft a cepty order for the Truoial States embodying some new features as suggested in the letter from Beckett. This new Order jpsuld then act as a model which could be adapted to the local conditions of Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar. Muscatf Muscat is in such a different position that we think this Order should be tackled separately at a later stage.

As regards paragraph 2, we agree that the functions at present attributed under the terms of the orders to various Indian authorities must be transferred, and in general they must be transferred to the Secretary of State, which will mean I think in future exclusively th^ Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs so far as these Gulf states are concerned. You raise the question of the confirmation of death sentences, and I think this is clearly a function which must now devolve on the Foreign Secretary who has, incidentally had to perform this function in the past in connexion with other countries in which we have extraterritorial jurisdiction. I do not think there is any necessity to consult either the Lord Chancellor or the Treasury Solicitor on this point. As regards appeals, ultimately there must be a right of appeal to the Privy Council. We can consider in detail what provisions should appear in the relevant Orders in Council as regards this appeal. Some other Foreign Office orders e.g. Egypt Orders in Council are helpful on this point. There is already, as I understand it, an appeal from a political agent’s court to the Political Resident’s Court (referred to rather inconveniently in the present orders by the expression 'Chief District Court' and 'Chief Court'.) I think this is all we should try and have, and the question then remains of appeals from the Political Resident’s Court to the Privy Council. While we shall have to maintain the general application of Indian law, I think we shall have, in the future, to break away to some extent, particularly as regards terminology and procedure, from the Indian system. Anyway, the next thing to be done/ E.P. Donaldson, Esq. , India Office.L ’ ' x • done seems to be to prepare an Order in Council applying to all these Persian Gulf places and making such changes as are necessary for the main purposes discussed above. At the same time we should consider whether we should make some, other changes, and I think that, in this connexion,!two most recent Egypt Orders in Council and perhaps the last China Order in Council and last Ethiopia Order in Council might be considered. This will be a fairly long job, and I think it is one which will have to be done in collaboration between someone in the India Office and one of the Legal Advisers to this Department. If you agree, perhaps you will let me know who in the India Office will be appointed to do this work, and we could then make arrangements for it to be started. ' L C-c-'Wt- /o-v (iV.fi. Beckett) P.S.

We have 'been considering the question of the amendments that './ill be necessary in the five Persian Gulf Orders-in-Council (Bahrein, 1913* Kuweit, 1935, Qatar, 1939, Muscat, 1939 and Trueial States, 1946) when control in the Gulf is transferred from the Government of India to Ii.M.G. on tne 1st Apr lx, ']947 j &amp;s is contemplated, bearing in mind the possibility that tne Indian Constituent Assembly may before long decide to leave the British Commonwealth. 2. It seems that the problem falls into two parts. Firstly, it must be decided what laws are to be applied in the Persian Gulf States. The present position is that specific British-Indian laws are applied by the Orders-in- Council, being either listed in the schedules appended thereto or referred to in the body of the Orders themselves, and that other laws not specifically^ mentioned in the Orders-in-Council or their Schedules may be applied in tne States concerned by the publications of King’s Regulations by the Political Resident. It is possible that an independent India might pass amendments to these lav/s which it would be undesirable to apply in the Arab Staues of the Persian Gulf. There seem to be, therefore, three possible courses for the future: (a) The Indian laws at present applied could remain in force but specific amendments to them would require to be applied by Regulation made by the I'olitical Resident before coming into force in the Persian Gulf; (b) The Indian laws at present applied could remain in force but no Indian amendments would apply tD them, the Political Resident applying any necessary amendments from time to time as occasion arose; (c) The existing (predominantly Indian) legal system could be scrapped and the corresponding English law substituted, with such adaptations and modifications as appear necessary. It seems to us that, apart altogether from the special provisions required for the determination of the various questions arising under Hindu and Mohammedan personal lav/, it would be highly inexpeuienc to scrap tne British-Indian legal framework tj which the. inhabitants of the area are accustomed and with which the Political Officers who administer the l a w are familiar. Instead of the application of English lav/, which would in many ways be inappropriate to the conditions, we consider, therefore, that .ne course indicated in (b) above is probably the most suitable. 3. The second question is how the functions at present attributed under the terms of the Orders to various Indian authorities are to be performed after the removal of the Persian Gulf administration from the supervision of the Government of India. '.Thatever system of law is adoptea, it will no longer be possible for reports and references to be made to Indian authorities, or lor the deportation to, or trial of accused persons in, India to take place. These functions will have to be transferred to appropriate British authorities. In particular we shall have to consider v/hat authority should replace che b-overnor— General in Council in paragraph 16 of the Koweit Order-in-Council (and correspondingly in the other Orders) for the purpose of conx inning death sentences. This is a matter on which we should perhaps consult the Lord Chancellor’s Office or the Treasury Solicitor. We should alsV lik* to get clear the question of appeal from the decision of the local courts. 1 There I / seemsN seems to be no reference in the Orders to an appeal to any authority in India, but presumably there is a right of appeal tj the x-'rivy Council within the limits of the Privy Council’s jurisdiction and that •.all remain. We should be grateful for any enlightenment you can give us on the point. 4 .. V/e have been through the Kuweit Order-in-Council (the other Orders are generally similar) and have listed those paragraphs which it appears to us will have to be amended one way or the other. This list is at tanned as an enclosure to this letter. The numbers of the corresponding paragraphs in the other three Orders-in-Council may be seen from the attached correspondence sheet (the Qatar Order-in-Council and the Trucial States Order-in-Council are identical, as regards the numbers of paragraphs.) 5. We should be glad to have your views on the questions raised above, and your advice as to what other departments we should consult on aspects which may fall outside the Foreign Office sphere, e.g. on the questions of appeal referred t:&gt; in paragraph 3 above. As regards the continued application of Brit ish-Indian law you may have already given some consideration to this in connection with the future of such Orders-in- Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act as those applying to Somaliland and Ethiopia by which Brit ish-Indian lav/ was also applied. 6 .

Roberts-Wray under cover of a letter on the lines of the attached draft.DRAFT LETTER Sir B. Reillly, K.C.M.G., Colonial Office, London, S#W.1. 2 8 jan 1947 S) The enclosed copj| of a letter I have recently sent to Beckett at the Foreign Office should perhaps more properly have been addressed to Roberts-Jrey as Beckettb opposite number in the Colonial Office, but in view of your own intimate personal experience with Aden(^^^thought^approprflate that I should send it to you in the hope that you might be willing to give us your help with the difficult practical points which arise in separating the Persian Gulf administration from the Government of India* If, as seems likely, it is necessary to have a meeting with the Foreign Office to discuss some of the difficulties which arise we should be very grateful if you would be so /goodMr.Donaldson I am not entirely sure that all the points that arise on this can best be dealt with by the Legal Depart ment of the Foreign Office, and we may be putting rather a lot upon them in asking them to undertake the job. For instance, what seems to me to^-be a rather difficult question is what authority is^beitig- put in the place of the Governor General in Council in rule 16 of the Koweit Order, for the purpose of confirming sentences of the local court. I am not sure that the Foreign Office can advise us about that, and perhaps we should rather go to the Treasury Solicitor or the Lord Chancellor's Office. But I !it would meet the case if you put something in the letter i giving Beckett an opening for dealing with those aspects &lt;'that concern him and advising us who best to consult as regards others • I agree in any case it is a good thing to let the Foreign Office have a look at it in the first instance, in view of their position as residuary legatee. I I asked Mr.Booth where appeals from the local Court would lie. He said there was no sign of any appeal to any authority in India and I suppose as the Political Resident's Court has more or less the status of a High Court, there is no Court in India to which an appeal could go from it. In that case there is no facility hitherto provided by India for which a substitute will have to be found. I suppose there was a right of appeal to the Firivy Council within the limits of the Privy Council's jurisdiction and that will remain. I think we might as well get clear on this question of appeal and for that purpose a reference might be made to it in the draft. p In this connection, and more particularly in connection with the matters we were discussing the other day, you will remember that Sir Bernard Riley has personal /experienceexperience of the analagous case at Aden. If. as I suppose, he is still available in the Colonial Office, it would be a good thing to consult him on some of these practical points. I understood he would be very ready to give us any help we might want.Affix jammed cab here DRAFT LETTER 9/09-IS J9 S W.E # Beckett, Esq., C.M.G., K.G., Foreign Office, S.W.l. 2 8 J#K m/ We have been considering the question of the amendments that will be necessary in the five Persian Gulf Orders-in-Council (Bahrein y 19139 Koweit 19359 Qatar 19399 Muscat»^39 and Snte / Trucial C 9 ap 4 &gt; ^194^) when control in the Gulf is transferred from the Government of.Djrdia to Quo «/&gt; C*»f on the 1st April, 1947)^/ It seems that e problem falls into two parts,; Firstly, it must be decided what laws ai’e it/*. be applied fcar the Persian Gulf states,. The present position is that specific British-Indiar laws are applied by the Orders-in-Council, being either listed in the schedules appended thereto^, or^in the body of the Orderf itoolf , and that other laws not specifically mentioned in the m '&amp;+&gt;**** 44 OrderVin-Council^may be applied the States concerned by the publication of King*s Regulations/aestoevir Regulations by the Political It is possible that an independent India joaty' pass amendments to t • these laws which it would be undesirable to apply l&amp;jfthe Persian G-ulf. There seem to be, therefore, three possibilities:- (a) The Indian laws at present applied cculd remain in force but specific amendments to them /o (it would require the ratirioat Ior- the Political wl*r/&lt;rvX 4 L, ^ Resident before they aro applied te the Persian Gulf* (b) The Indian laws at present applied could remain in force but no Indian amendments would apply to them, the Political Resident applying rv€, # amendments from time to time as nooeooity arose s i ' D ' 3,0 (c) The existing^predominantly Indian^legal system could be scrapped and the corresponding . ^KrUU Brj^jioh lawj^ substituted^v/'ith such ameni'lmen^^ as appear necessary. It seems to us thaty apart altogether from the special provisions required for the determination of/u s lL l /C /V&gt;.'*w C 4 * ■ * - Q&gt; ^ % v of the various questions arising under Hindu and Moharnrnedan person^t£ law, it would be inexpedient to scrap the British Indian legal framework to which the inhabitants of the area are accustomed and with which the Political Officers /are familiar. jfersSaamttr of ^English law, which v/ould in many ways be inappropriate to the conditions, we consider, therefore, that the course indicated in (b) above is probably the most suitable. The second question is Hrrir-'y# how the functions at present! undoten by various dU&gt; ^ Indian off iclaJ?, bodies and-e^ganiofttiono are '7 to be undent ale etr. V/hatever system of lav/ is 4 adoptedyit will no longer be possible under ‘ luiy oinoumB^anu^gr'for reports and references od to be made to Indian AuthoirLties for the deportation to^ or trial of accused persons inyIndia to take place.

As to the general question of the law in fact to be made applicable, apart altogether from the special provisions required for the determination of the various questions arising under Hindu and Mohammedan personal law, I doubt whether it would be found expedient to scrap the British Indian law at present applicable^which the inhabitants have come to appreciate and understand and with which the political officers have long been familiar, in favour of English law,which would in many ways be inappropriatiwfc in the conditions, and of which the political officers can certainly have little knowledge. (I do not know how far the Pacific Order in Council / which applied English law, has been found in practice to be satisfactory)• I would ngrself prefer to see the adoption of the .. fr** course indicated in (b) above? It is a matter, however, * *■' ^v'*^ on which the Foreign Office will undoubtedly have views, 9 ,c as I imagine that there are other Orders in Council which are more particularly their concern and which will be similarly affected. I presume, for exanqple, that unless war conditions have involved amendments or revocation, the Somaliland and Ethkpian,and no doubt other Orders in Council which applied British Indian law, will have to be reconsidered I agree that amendments on the lines of those indicated as 'suggested amendments ” to the Koweit Order in Councill will in any case have to be made. M ■Persian G-ulf Orders-in-Council 1. With the impending transfer of control in the Persian G-ulf from the Govemment of India to H*M.G. , the four Persian G-ulf Orders-in-Council (Bahrein 1913, Koweit 1935, Qatar, 1939; Muscat 1939) will require considerable amendment. As they stand, they are based principally on Indian law and the Indian legal system, and British enactments have been applied to them only as and when it appeared necessary. 2 . The problem of amending them therefore falls into two parts. (a) '/hat laws are to be applied to the Persian Gulf States? (b) How shall the functions at present undertaken by various Indian Officials, bodies and organisations be fulfilled, and who will fulfil them? 3. The present position as regards the application of Indian Law is as follows. Various Indian enactments are expressly mentioned in the Orders-in-Council or in the Schedules appended thereto, and these laws as they may be amended from time to time, are applied in whole or in part to the Persian Gulf States concerned. Other laws, not listed in the Orders-in-Council or the Schedules, may be applied to the States by King’s Regulations published by the Political Resident under the authority given him in the various orders in Council. A. It is however possible that an independent India may pass 'amendments to these laws unsuitable to the Persian Gulf, and may, though we hope not, indulge in legislation discriminating against Europeans; it would clearly be impossible to have such laws or amendments applied to the Persian Gulf States. There seem| therefore to be three possibilities as regards the legal structure to be applied by the Orders-in-Council when control is transferred, each one with some attendant disdvantages. (a) The Indian Laws at present applied could remain in force, but specific amendments to them would require the ratification of the Political Resident through the publication of a King’s Regulation before they applied to the Persian Gulf States, or (b) The Indian Laws as at present applied would remain in force, but no Indian amendments would apply to than, the Political Resident supplying his own amendments from time to time as necessityi^rose. These two possibilities are open to various objections: firstly, they would tend to create a separate and special legal code for the Persian Gulf States, which might in e ffect prove to be beyond the powers of officers who are not lawyers first and foremost adequately to control; and secondly, it would involve a great deal of extra work for those officers, who may have little time to spare for it. There is a third possibility, which is (c) That the existing predominantly Indian legal framework should be scrapped and the corresponding British laws substituted, with such amendments as appear necessary. The main objection to this appears to be . that problems are apt to arise in the * East/16/ - 2 - East for which British law caters only imperfectly or not at all, especially those concerned with disputes as between religions: and so the amount of amendment or addition which might be necessary would be very considerable. 5 . The second question to be resolved is that of who is to take over the functions at present undertaken by various Indian Officials and organisations. The existing legal machine in the Persian Gulf States is modelled on that in an Indian province; and as in India the highest court of appeal is the Governor-General Further, the Political Resident may direct that cases may, if he considers it advisable, be tried in Bombay, and he may send convicted criminals for imprisonment in Bombay. These are indispensable functions and will have to be deputed to some not too distant British authority; possibly to the Governor of Aden, if he is competent to act in such a capacity. 6 . I have been through the Koweit Order-in-Council and have listed below those paragraphs which will have to be amended one way or the other. ,There the amendments are simple I suggest revised wordings; where they are complex I suggest a possible line of action. The numbers of the corresponding paragraphs in the other three Orders in Council may be seen from the attached correspondence sheet. Suggested amendments - Koweit Order in Council paras 1-2.

I replied that so far as I was aware there was no such appeal, and I am now able to confirm this. 2. For practical purposes the only occasion when any reference has to be made to India in a judicial case is when a death sentence is passed c.f. Article 15 of the Bahrain Order in Council. Some other provision will have to be made for the confirmation of such sentences when control passes from the Government of India to His Majesty's Government. — \ 3. The Governor General in Council is also mentioned in the following Articles in the Bahrain Order in Council and in corresponding Articles in the other Orders in Council : 14(1), 21C3), 22(6) ^ and 35(1). , There should be little 'difficulty in making appropriate omissions or amendments when the change-over takes place. 4.

The Government of India have also one to suggest in their Express Letter of the 10th July. These all seem to me to be all right, but you may perhaps have some comments on the points raised in the minuting at X. A draft to the Poreign Office is attached. There is, however, one major point for consideration now looming up, which arises from the impending constitutional changes in India. These Persian Gulf Orders all apply the law of British India to a stated extent to the Shaikhdoms and contain various references (e.g. to British India, the Governor- General in Council) which will shortly be rendered anachronisms. As regards the general question of the application of parts of the law of British India to the Shaikhdoras, this may I suppose continue to be all right if India assumes Dominion status and remain ^ within the Empire, but if she becomes independent it wiSfc presumably no longer be appropriate to apply parts of the Indian legal system to British protected states like these Shaikhdoras. In any case, it seems inevitable that as soon as a major constitutional change takes place in India all these Persian Gulf Orders will require amendment to a grearter or lesser extent. As regards the present case of the Trucial States Order-in-Council, it would seem probable that we should for the raoraent ignore the impending difficulties and proceed to have it issued as at present drafted as soon as possible, if this can be managed. It can then at a later date, when it lias become clear what modifications will be necessary, be amended simultaneously with all the other Persian Gulf Orders. I I should be grateful for any observations you may haveI am sorry that this file has been held up owing to my absence. 1. I still do not see why, if^as I gather all the TrucxLal Sheikhs have in fact agreed to the exercise by His Majesty of Jurisdiction over all foreigners (as defined in Article 4)* article - ^l)(a) (ii) should not run as in the Quatar Order in Council, namely 'foreigners within the limits of this Order'. 2. I agree with the amendment proposed by the Government of India in the schedule, but,as practically all the acts therein mentioned deal with matters that are either in the Provincial or in the Concurrent Legislative List (and are therefore subject to amendment in Bombay) , I would suggest - though I do not press the point - that article 11(4) might well be supplemented by the insertion in Article 11(2) of the words 'as they apply in the Province of Bombay' after the words 'subject to this Order'.Mr.Harrison r^K. r&gt;JM /) &gt; u ; hM f stc th /&gt; fc ^ r (ft** Colonel Hay* s suggestions all appear to be obvious improvements with the possible exception of his para*3(b). This is a small matter but should perhaps be attended to for the sake of completeness. Colonel Hay* s draft wording for the earlier sub-clause of4para«3(fc) not only omits the reference to 'the Persian coast and islands’* but the words ’’all other places on the shores of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman”. These would no doubt be objectionable as including Saudi Arabian and Iraqi territory, but in order not to omit at the same time that part of the coast between Qatar and the Trucial States, would it perhaps be as well to include some such phrase as ’’all other places on the shores of the Persian Gulf, not being Saudi Arabian, Iraqi, or Persian territory”? The inclusion of Aden in paragraph 12(2)lS(e) of the Qatar Order in Council of 1939 and thus in this draft for the Trucial States was copied fran the Kuwait Order in Council of 1933. Meanwhile, however, Aden had passed under Colonial Office control in 1937 and its retention as one of a ’’group” of British possessions, all of which are subordinate to the Government of India A to which the Indian Penal Code applies,has become anomalous logically, though, its inclusion may 91 be advisable as being of practical value. A difficulty of greater substance arises over the definition of classes of persons to whom the Order in Council would be applicable in Section 8 1(a). The phrase at present suggested, viz. ’’foreigners with respect to whom die Trucial SheiMis have severally agreed with His Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of jurisdiction ty His Majesty' is copied from the Bahrein Order in Council of I 9 I 3 &gt; of which the corresponding section 8 1(2) reads:- /'foreigners'Foreimers -with respect to ■ whom the Sheikh of Bahrein has agreed with His Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of jurisdiction by His Majesty”# This wording however is capable of being misunderstood as it suggests that there are some classes of foreigners in respect of whom the Sheikhs have not ceded jurisdiction whereas as can be seen from Ext.Wfi and 3^58 of 1945, there are not. The Legal Adviser, for instance, in his note on your minute 01 7th November, 1945 seems to have taken the more limited meaning Might it not be better to word it, e.g. 'Foreigners, the Trucial Sheikhs having severally agreed ■ with His Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of jurisdiction by His Majesty in respect of them'? y. 0 , .

The Political Resident has now secured from all the Trucial Sheikhs acceptance in writing of the position that jurisdiction over British subjects and all foreigners (i. e. including Moslem foreigners) is exercised by the British Government. In paragraph 3 of his express letter of the 22nd August 3 the Political Resident has suggested that a draft Order in Council should be prepared in. London^on the lines of the Qatar Order in Council with consequential amendments necessitated by the cession of jurisdiction over all foreigners instead of only non-Moslem foreigners. I have gone through the Qatar Order in Council and made to tue best of my ability the necessary amendments in red ink. The following points call for special notice. (1) The title of the Order in Council . It seems to me that it would be (( more appropriate to call this the' Trucial States Order in Council than the Trucial Coast Order in Council.' I notice that the 'Trucial States' are referred to in sub— paragraph(ii)of the definition of 'British protected person' on page 2 of the Qatar Qraer in Council. y (2) The limits of the Order . (Article 2 of Part I of the draft Order in Council). A difficulty anises here in that there is no agreed geographical definition of the limits of the Trucial States except for°the Coast line. Inland, the boundary is in dispute with Ibn Saud and not agreed with the Sultan of Muscat. Internally some of the Sheikhs claim boundaries that overlap with each otner and in some areas none of them exercise any effective jurisdiction o^ er the smaller Chiefs. However, I do not think we can do other^ than describe the limits of the Order as being the territories 01 the Trucial Sheikhs. (3) Joint Court . (Definition on page 3 ). This will need thinking out a little. I presume that it would be composed of the Political Agent and of tne particular Trucial Sheikh concerned (or his representative) and not of the Political Agent and a representative of the Trucial Sheikhs as a whole. (if) The application o f the Order to all foreij;ners . (See para.. 3 of the Political Resident's express letter of 22nd August). So far as I can see, the only alteration from the Qatar Order in Council that is necessaiy is in Part I , ^ v 0 whici. as now amended in red ink corresponds with 8 1(2) of the Bahrein Order in Council, except that the word 'severc-dly' has been inserted. Subject to any comments which you may have, I think tne next step will be to send a copy of the Order in Council as amended in red' ink to the Foreign Office and simultaneously to the Political Resident/ 4 37 10P b /Im lu. j /&amp; V*J*U*£ &gt; J^rh.'b ,C.W.

We are . • t • asking the Political Resident whether he aiw has any ccoonients on the draft and I enclose A herewith a copy of a letter we have sent to / him which draws attention to the main points worthy of notice,. 3. We should be grateful if the draft could be considered in the Foreign Office and if you would let us have in due course your observations on it.

Department. 21 NOV 1945 With reference to the correspondence resting with the Residency memorandum No, C/350 dated 25th October, we have been considering here a draft Order in Council to cover the Trucial Qp&amp;gi Sheikhdoms, and I now enclose a copy of the Qatar Order in Council with suitable amendments inserted in red ink, 2, The following points call for special notice - (1) The title of the Order in Council It would perhaps be laore-Qipppopria^e to call it the 'Trucial States Order in Council' rather than the 'Trucial Coast Order in Council', (2) The limits of the Order (Article 2 of Pt. I of the draft Order in Council) A difficulty of course arises here in that there is no agreed geographical definition of the limits of the Trucial c States except for the Coast*line and internally the boundaries claimed by seme of the Sheikhs overlap, while in other areas the Sheikhs do not exercise effective Jurisdiction over the smaller Chiefs. However, it does not seem that we can do otherwise than describe the limits of the Order as being the territories of the Trucial Sheikhs, (3) Joint Court (Definition on page 3) We presume that the Joint Court envisaged/envisaged would be ooinposed of the Political Agent and of the particular Tracial Sheikh concerned (or his representative) and not of the Political Agent and t&gt;^representative of the Trucial Sheikhs as a whole. The passage in the Order in Council has been drafted accordingly. (4) The application of the Order to all foreigners So far as we can see, the only alterations from the Qatar Order in Council necessary are as follows:- n (a) In Pt. I 8( 1)(a)(«f£)^ which as now amended in red ink corresponds with 8 1(2) of the Bahrein Order in Council^ except that the word 'severally' has been inserted. (b) Sub-clause (ii) of the definition of 'British protected person' has been omitted in the revised draft. For the purposes of jurisdiction, I understand that we should treat the subjects of the other Sheikhdoms as British protected persons (see Fowle's D.O. letter No. 116-S of 13th February 1936) though in the case of Q a tar not having jurisdiction over th^Muslims, we could not do this. (c) In the definition of 'Trucial States subject' (page 3), the words 'or any Muslini person not being a British subject' have been omitted. The effect of the retention of these words would be to reserve to the Trucial States the jurisdiction over Muslim foreigners as over their own subjects. 3. I should be glad if you would let me know whether you have any comments on the draft Order/Draft Paper. Department. Order in its present form. 4.

In order to secure uniformity, to meet all future requirements and to avoid as far as possible amendments, each of which will necessitate reference to the several rulers of the Coast, it is felt that tnis course is preferable to any attempt at simplification e.f.

Jurisdiction in Trucisl Sheikhdoms! it seems wall to relate proposed action to position in Bahrain and Koweit. Jurisdiction over British suhiects and all other foreigners in Bahrain rests on Sheikh Esa r s letter of July 16th 1909* In Koweit jurisdiction was ceded by Sheikh Abroad's lettec ^Qf N ovember 4th 1925 but this_ extends only to subjects and'rf 0 tedt§d ^ers-ons-of -nun Musiem foreign governments. 2o YJhen question of cession of jurisdiction in Trucial Sheikdoms was considered in 1959 it was dropped mainly on the ground stated by F owle that Sheikhs were under the impression that the right of jurisdiction over British sublets and non Moslem foreigners already existed. We agree with Prior that present developments render it undesirable to leave matters in this state any longer and that position should be related to that in Bahrain and Koweit, in both of which cases orders in council depend on formal written agreements by Sheikhs concern-d. 3, Main difficulty in the present case seems likely to be that it necessitates simultaneous approach to large number of rulers who may be in theposition to consult together. Me are however content to leave to Prior decision ca to the best method and moment at which to make the approach to ^he Sheikhs concerned. j RECD. pyL U*-»• j 6 MARION INDIA OFFICEPlease see the Political Residents telegram No*287 of the 8th February below. The position as regards H.M.G’s relationship to the Trucial Sheikhs is that they are bound not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any power other than the British Government, not to consent to the residence in their territory of the agent of any other government, and not to cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give ^occupation 4^-any part of their territories, save to the British Government* They have not, however, ceded jurisdiction over either foreigners or British subjects as Bahrein, Koweit and Qatar have done. The question of securing jurisdiction and introducing an Order-in-Council covering the Trucial Sheikhdoms was considered just before the war but was not pursued. What we then had chiefly in mind was the securing of adequate powers to deal with possible activities in the Sheikhdoms by enen^r agents,etc. in time of war. Sir T.Fowle (the Political Resident of the time) took the line that an Order-in-Council was not necessary at the present stage. If drilling by P.C.L. began, involving the presence of large numbers of foreigners,or if oil was found and oilfields developed, then an Order-in-Council would no doubt be necessary, but not until then. As the means for the preventing of activities by enemy agents, it was not necessary. It appears that the Sheikhs are at present under the impression that we have jurisdiction over British subjects and non-Moslem foreigners, though this is not, in fact, the case. It would probably be impossible to get the Sheikh to cede tissr jurisdiction over Moslem foreigners (there are a number of Persians and also, I imagine, Saudi Arabs involved). Sir G.Prior’s present recommendation is on two grounds - (a) anticipated early exploration by P.C.L* (b) possible post-war attempts at penetration by foreigners* As regards (a), we have recently heard that P.C.L. have it in mind to send a geological survey party to the Trucial Coast, hinterland (including in particular Abu DhabiV territory) next winter and that the party will probably include a number of American experts. There is no possibility of P.C.L. developing oilfields in the Trucial Sheikhdoms for two or three years at the earliest and probably not for some time after that, but in the event of such development an Order-in-Council will certainly be necessary. As regards (b), the Political Resident presumably has the Americans in mind. The Sheikhs already bound not to admit into fhia^ territories the agents of any other governments and we have the safeguard provided by our power to issue or with-hold visas to visit the Sheikhdoms. An Order-in-Council would, however, give us additional power to control the behaviour of Americans or other foreigners. The Political Resident's present proposal is, as a first stage, to secure the formal exchange of letters with the Trucial Sheikhs* ceding to H.M.G. jurisdiction over British subjects, British protected persons (this would include the subjects of the other Arab Sheikhdoms) and non-Moslem foreigners. This is presumably intended as a preliminary to the issue of an Order-in- Council (the usual formula at the beginning of a Persian Gulf States Order-in-Council is: 'Whereas by treaty, capitulation, grant, usuage, sufferance and other lawful means His Majesty the King has jurisdiction in Now, therefore, His Majesty by virtue and in exercise of the powers in this behalf by the following Jurisdiction Act, 1890, etc.'J There is, of course, no need to bring the Order-in-Council into force immediately upon the securing of agreement by the rulers to cede jurisdiction. In the case of Bahrein (see printed memorandum below, particularly paragraphs 7 and 11) the Sheikh in 1909 addressed to the Political Agent a /letter 7 ^ pSVsfy** \ letter ceding jurisdiction over foreigners, but subsequently tried to make out that this did not cover the dependents of petty Arab potentates in the Gulf. An Order-in-Council was issued in 1913 * In 1920 the Political Agent, after complaints by Ib^n Saud and the Sheikh of Qatar issued a notice that all foreign subjects were while in Bahrein * . subj ect to Br itish protection. This was not well received of- the Sheikti^but was not contested by him, and since 1920 A jurisdiction over all foreign subjects has rested with British political authorities* - Aw. ^ ^ ^ Cl* &lt;+■&lt;* \ t&amp;L . In the present case of the Trucial Sheikhdoms, it would appear that an exchange of letters ceding jurisdiction would certainly be desirable as a preliminary to an Order-in- Council, but I am not sure that it would be essential if it can be shown that the British Government already have jurisdiction by usage or sufferance? May be, however, it would be impossible to show this. Although there is a possibility of it proving difficult to secure an exchange of letters with some of the rulers (viz* Abu Dhabi and Has A 1 Khaimah) the Political Resident advises going ahead and trying. tC*. Mir* b~ c* fZuj a. A iC. fict* . On the whole, it seems desirable to support the present Political Residents proposal to the Foreign Office. I should not think that there are likely to be any foreign reactions fran the Americans and they need in any case be told nothing at the present stage. If they do object we can use the argument that it is desirable to protect American citizens against the possibility of having to submit to the jurisdiction of the Sheikhs, which they certainly would not like.

Powle took the line that an Order-in-Council was not really necessary for this purpose but that one would no doubt be necessary if drilling by P.C.L. began ; involving the presence of large numbers of foreigners, or if oil was found and oilfields developed. We understand that P.C.L. have it in mind to send a geological expedition to the Trucial Coast hinterland next winter, which would probably include some dozen or so American experts, and it would appear that the time is approaching when oil developments may begin. We feel that it would probably be a good idea to secure the cession of jurisdiction, if possible, before that stage is reached and since the Political Resident advises that the present is a good opportunity to approach the SheikhJ ^ we would propose, if you agree, A to give him the authorisation for which he asks. / As . J * i regards'any adverse reactions from the Americans, one would expect that they would^prefer their citizens to be subject to British jurisdiction rather than that of 4** ^ ftfs****^ the local chiefs. In any nase there would seem no 7 ' reason wly they need hear of any negotiations at the present stage* /We(3) We therefore support the Political Resident's proposal and would be glad to know whether you would see any objection to our informing him that we agree to his proceeding as he proposes. i*^- if-^ tu, tf^ 4 */*- L&lt; J &lt; ~“~ &lt; &gt; -A V c . ^ Y “Xau- (Sgd.) R. PEEL.CONFIDENTIAL. India Office B. 422 . P. 1632 / 30 . Exercise of Jurisdiction in Cases affecting Foreign Subjects in Bahrein by the British Political Authorities. Jurisdiction over British Subjects. * 1. Article 4 of the Convention of 1861 between the Sheikh of Bahrein and the British Government provides that “ all offences which they (British subjects) may commit, or which may be committed against them, shall be reserved for the decisions of the British Resident, provided the British Agent located at Bahrein shall fail to adjust them satisfactorily.” Jurisdiction in Cases affecting- Foreigners. 2 . By the Agreement of 22 nd December 1880 and the Exclusive Agreement of 13 th March 1892 , the Sheikh bound himself not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any Governments other than Ilis Majesty’s Government ; not to allow the Agents of such Governments to reside within his territory without the assent of His Majesty’s Government; and not to alienate, mortgage, or give for occupation any part of- his territories save to His Majesty’s Government. Responsibility for the protection of foreigners in Bahrein maybe regarded as having passed to His Majesty’s Government as a corollary to these two Agreements. But the question of jurisdiction does not appear to have arisen in an active form until 1900 . In December of that year the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, reported that a German subject, Mr. Wonckhaus, intended to open a branch of his business in Bahrein. The Political Resident suggested that, in the event of any mercantile or other cases arising between Bahreini subjects and Mr. Wonckhaus or his agent, the Assistant Political Agent should be instructed to deal with such cases as if they were cases between British subjects and subjects of the Sheikh. 3 . The Government of India informed the Political Resident in reply that “ Mr. Wonckhaus being a foreigner and not a protected person, the Assistant Political Agent cannot claim any jurisdiction in such cases. Mr. Wonckhaus and his agent, if a foreigner and not a native Indian subject of His Majesty, must be regarded as liable in such cases to the jurisdiction of the Sheikh. “ As, however, the Sheikh is bound, under treaty, not to admit the consular agencies of other nations without the consent of the British Government, it is expedient that the British representative should, as a matter of courtesy, extend his good offices to European foreigners in any disputes between them and the Chief of Bahrein or his subjects, and, in the event of necessity, he should claim to protect all such foreigners as he would a British subject. I am to request that Mr. Gaskin ma} 7- be instructed to this effect.” The action taken by the Government of India was subsequently approved by His Majesty’s Government. 4 . In June 1903 , the question having arisen of the purchase by Mr. Wonckhaus of certain premises in Bahrein which he had hitherto held on a temporary lease, the Government of India instructed the Political Resident as follows :—“ In view ... of the belief which Mr. Wonckhaus is reported to hold that, in the event of his acquiring property, he will not be amenable to local law, but will be subject to the extra-territorial jurisdiction of Courts of his own country (though there are none such with local jurisdiction in Bahrein), the Government of India approve your proposal to warn the Sheikh of Bahrein that no such acquisition can give to any Consul or other representative of a foreign nation the right to enter into direct relations with the Chief, and that, should any such official address the Chief, he should be referred to the British authorities. The position should also be clearly explained to Mr. Wonckhaus.” 4371 75 3.30 Lr. d. 4 May 1901, No. 708 E.A., end. in G. of I. Desp. 72, of 9 Mav 1901 P. 614/01.

Lr. from Pol. Res. to G. of I., No. 1863, d. 31 July 1909. 5 . No dispute involving the question of jurisdiction over foreigners appears to have arisen in Bahrein until lUOI. In 1 . 004-5 two incidents affecting foreign subjects took place in the Islands. In the first of these, a German subject—an employee of Messrs. Wonckhaus—became involved in a brawl, in the course of which he suffered personal injuries. Failing, as lie thought, to secure adequate redress through the Political Agent, to whom his first complaint was addressed, Mr. Wonckhaus made representations to the German Consul at Basra, who addressed the Sheikh direct on the subject. His Excellency, in reply, acknowledged the letter and added, “ I have now to inform you that this matter is before the British Government, and [ cannot say anything on the subject.” The Foreign Office at a later stage instructed the Charge d’Affaires at Berlin that, should representations be made to him in the matter by the German Government, he should state that it had been brought to the notice of His Majesty’s Government, and that a British ship would be sent to Bahrein in order that an inquiry might be instituted. The German Government do not appear to have taken any action. The German Consul at Basra subsequently thanked the Political Resident “for your efficient help to the German firm, which, I trust, settles the case.” C. In the second case (November 1904 ), an accidental quarrel having arisen between a retainer of the Sheikh’s nephew and a Persian, attacks were made upon Persian subjects in Bahrein. Apprehensive that the Sheikh would endeavour to deal with the case in the local Courts, they telegraphed for support to the Shah, and conversations took place between His Majesty’s Minister and the Mushir-ud-Dowleh, as the result of which the latter telegraphed to the Persian community urging them to keep calm, as “I have had a long talk with the British Minister . . . and I am sure he will take early steps to get the affairs settled and the culprit punished.” The Sheikh, however, adopted an uncompromising attitude on the question of jurisdiction, maintaining that he would not admit any interference “ in cases between Arabs and Persians, who were ail Mohammedans,” and that they must go before the local Shara Courts, which, composed as they were of Sunnis, were unlikely to do justice to the Shiah Persians. Argument proving unavailing, an ultimatum was presented to His Excellency. He accepted the demands of His Majesty’s Government, and though no specific reference to the point was made in the ultimatum, the jurisdiction of the Political Agent appears thenceforth to have been definitely established, as a a m atterofjjrac t ice, in respect of British and foreign subjects in Bahrein'. 7 . Correspondence took place between 1908 and 1911 in regard to the preparation of an Order in Council to confer jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners in the Islands on the Political Agent at Bahrein. It was decided that it was desirable to obtain a formal request from the kheddi that lie should be lelieved of jurisdiction over foreigners After discussion with the Political Agent, His Excellency addressed'the latter on Ifith July 1909 , in the following terms After compliments. It is not hidden iiom you that 1 have had considerable trouble in many cases (that arose) in my territory in which foreigners were involved. For this reason I wish that I may not be held responsible in these cases, and I would be grateful to British Government if they remove this trouble and responsibility from me. I mean that it (the British Government) should exercise authority m all cases in which the foreigners only are concerned but not in other cases ; and in cases that occur between foreigners and my subjects, it is necessary that you and 1 should settle them jointlv.” 8. The Political Resident remarked, with reference to the reservation contained in the concluding sentence of the Sheikh’s letter, “As its effect is simply that such cases will be disposed of by the joint Court and o-ives foreigners the same treatment that British subjects now receive there seems no need for exception to be taken to it.” 9 . The Sheikh subsequently represented that his letter of 10 th July 1909 , giving jurisdiction over foreigners to the British Government was intended only “to cover subjects of recognised Powers and not the dependents of petty Arab potentates in Gulf, with some of whom he claimso o r foreigners ,vo incidents 5 t of these, a nvolved in a idling, as lie mt, to whom lentations to rect on the and added, Grovernment, e at a later presentations should state ent, and that iry might be 3 taken any the Political trust, settles arrel having sian, attacks t the Sheikh telegraphed lis Majesty’s li the latter calm, as “ I sure he will shed.” The question of ce “in cases id that they they were of Argument Mlency.

I informed him that if he could produce Viceroy’s tel. to agreements, and if the other parties, on being referred to, acknowledged of ^Jui^isi^re. their validity, 1 thought we should be prepared to recognise them . . .” peatingtel. from Jn the light of the protest in question, the wording of the Draft Order in Council was amended to its present form, under which (Article 8 of the Order in Council of 1913 ) the power conferred by the Order extends “to the persons and matters following in so far as by Treaty, grant, usage, sufferance, or other lawful means, His Majesty has jurisdiction in relation to such persons, matters, and things, that is to say :— ( 1 ) British subjects as herein defined within the limits of this Order. ( 2 ) Foreigners with respect to whom the Sheikh of Bahrein has agreed unth His Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of jurisdiction by His Majesty. ( 3 ) Bahrein subjects registered in the Political Agency as being in the regular service of British subjects or foreigners; with the proviso that all cases wherein such Bahrein subjects are concerned shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Part V of this Order. ( 4 ) The expression ‘person to whom this. Order applies’ shall be construed in accordance with the above three sub-Articles. ( 5 ) 1 he property and all personal or proprietary rights and liabilities within the said limits of British subjects and of foreigners within sub-Article ( 2 ) and of Bahrein subjects within sub-Article ( 3 ), whether such persons are themselves within or without the limits of this Order. (G) British ships and ships belonging to foreigners within sub- Article ( 2 ) with their boats, and the persons and property on board thereof, or belonging thereto, being within the limits of this Order; provided that jurisdiction over foreign ships shall not be exercised otherwise than according to the practice of the High Court in England in the exercise of jurisdiction over foreign ships. ( 7 ) If any question arises whether the subjects or citizens of any country, State, or tribe have or have not been placed under the jurisdiction of His Majesty by agreement with, or the consent of, the Sheikh of Bahrein, it shall be referred by the Court to the Political Resident, and a certificate under his hand and seal shall be conclusive on the question and judicial notice shall be taken thereof.” 10. Part V of the Order, to which reference is made in Article 8 quoted above, deals with the important class of case, whether civil or criminal, in which the parties are respectively a Bahrein subject and a person to whom the Order applies. The procedure laid down in it is as follows : — “ (a) Criminal. Article 41 .—( 1 ) When a Bahrein subject desires to institute a complaint against a person to whom this Order applies, or a person to whom this Order applies desires to institute a complaint against a Bahrein subject, the Political Agent shall entertain the same, and may— (a) with the concurrence of the Sheikh of Bahrein, himself hear and determine it in his District Court, or (b) send it to the Joint Court, or (c) if the defendant is a Mahommedan, refer it to a Kazi for decision, sending a representative of the Agency to record briefly the proceedings. Such decision, when endorsed by the Political Agent, shall for all purposes be considered as if it were that of the District Court. (2) Nothing in this Article shall prevent the Political Resident from exercising the revisory powers possessed by him under Article 4 of the Convention with Bahrein, dated the 31 st May ISGlA * See para. 1 above.4 P. 5040/20. P. 5668/27. Pol. Res. Desp. to G. of I., No. 295 S, of 1 Sept. 1927, para. 28. (b) Civil. Article 45 .—(1) When a Bahrein subject desires to bring a suit against a person to whom this Order applies, or a person to whom this Order applies desires to bring a suit against a Bahrein subject, the Political Agent shall admit the complaint, and (а) with the concurrence of the Sheikh of Bahrein, may hear and determine the suit in his District Court, or (б) may hear and determine it in a Joint Court, or (c) may refer it to the Majlis-el-Urf for decision, or (d) in cases between pearling-masters and divers, may refer it to the Salifah Court, or (e) with the consent of the several parties, may refer the case to one or more Arbitrators for settlement. (2) The judgment of the Joint Court or of the Majlis-el-Urf shall for all purposes be considered the same as if it were that of the District Court. ( 3 ) An appeal from the decision of the Salifah Court shall lie to the Political Agent acting in concert with the Sheikh of Bahrein, and in all Salifah cases their joint decision shall be final. ( 4 ) The award of -the Arbitrator under Sub-Article 1 (e) shall be final, and shall not be open to appeal unless the same shall within a reasonable time have been ordered by the Political Agent to be set aside on the ground that it is not linal or is defective, or that the Arbitrator has exceeded his authority, or has been guilty of misconduct in the matter. ( 5 ) Nothing herein mentioned shall prevent the District Court, the Joint Court, the Majlis-el-Urf, the Salifah Court, or the Arbitrator from referring any matter in the progress of a suit which involves a point of Mahommedan law to a Kazi for decision, or from sending any party or witness, being a Mahommedan, to a Kazi for the administration of an oath.” 11 . At no subsequent stage does the Sheikh appear to have shown any signs of going back on his delegation of responsibility in respect of foreigners other than the subjects of States in the Persian Gulf, to His Majesty’s Government. Difficulties, however, arose in the post-war period in connection with his claim to exercise jurisdiction over Nejdis and inhabitants of El Katr. In 1920 protests were received from Ibn Saud as to the exercise of jurisdiction by the Sheikh over Nejdi subjects. A similar protest appears to have been made at about the same time by the Sheikh of Qatr, both parties requesting the Political Agent to exercise jurisdiction on their behalf. The Political Agent in consequence issued on 20 th November 1920 a notice that all foreign subjects, including Persians and subjects of Arab Rulers and Chiefs other than those of Bahrein, were, while in Bahrein, entitled to British protection. The decision was not well received by the Sheikh ; but it has not been contested by him, and since 1920 jurisdiction over all foreign subjects has rested with the British Political authorities within the limits of the Orders in Council of 1913 and 1922 , as subsequently amended.

My dear Peel, Many thanks for your letter P.Z.3670/39 of the 15th June on the subject of the exercise of British jurisdiction on the Trucial Coast, enclosing a draft of the letter which the Political Resident would send to the Sheikhs in the event of war. 2. We are inclined to agree with Fowle's views. In so far as peace time activities are concerned the problem is not urgent, and if he feels that to ask for a specific grant of jurisdiction would merely lead to refusals in certain cases it is perhaps best not to say anything yet. 3. Even in time of war, though the absence of jurisdiction, even over British subjects, might be a source of difficulty, we feel that, on the whole, if we can rely on the Sheikhs to exercise their jurisdiction in an emergency in accordance with our advice for the purpose of dealing with undesirable activities, this might well prove RECo.POll.DEPr.f 1 3 JUi. 1939 INDIA OFFICE in/ R.

With regard to the draft letter to the Sheikh, we notice that in paragraphs 1 and 2 the expressions 'all the subjects of your State', 'any of your subjects' and 'your subjects' are employed. Strictly speaking, the reference ought to be to all persons in the Sheikh’s territory, but I suppose that such a phrase has not been employed because of the undesirability of raising the question of jurisdiction over foreigners in the territory in question, and that it is thought that, in view of the very limited number of foreigners who are likely to be concerned, the provisions in 'Thirdly' of paragraph 2 and in paragraph 3 should suffice. I expect this is all right, but we thought it desirable to bring the point to your notice. 5.

After consultation with the Political Agent Bahrain, following are my views. (a) It would be impossible to porsuade Sheikhs to cede jurisdiction over Moslem foreigners. (b) Sheikhs at present are under (? wholesome) impression that we have right of jurisdiction over British subjects and non-Moslem foreigners. They would, therefore, I think, hand over to us enemy agents from this class, (e) An approach to Sheikhs however for formal cession would probably destroy this impression and at any rate in the case of some of them would result in refusal to cede jurisdiction.(d) In plaed of n alans n I am in favour of our preparing, for issue in case of need, letters to Sheikhs informing them that, in view of our treaties, we expect their co-operation in war, including suppression of certain hostile activities in their territory. 2. In all the circumstances, therefore, I am not in favour of approaching Sheikhs. Letter follows.Draft Paper.

V coL Could you please refer to your letter No*P.Z.216/39, dated the 16th February 19 39, on the subject of an Order in Council for the Trucial Coast# 2# Under present conditions there is no necessity for an Order in council. If oil is found and oil fields are developed, as at Bahrain, an Order in Council will doubtless be required. Short of that if the Company begin drilling seriously involving the establishment of camps, and the presence of large numbers of foreigners, then also an Order in Council would be advisable# It is quite possible, however that as a final result of their explorations the Company may decide to do no drilling and they will not be in a position, as I understand it, to make any decision on this point until their preliminary work is a good deal more advanced, say until after their next winters explora tion. 3. Briefly therefore the situation is not that an Order in council will be required at some future date, but that one may not be required at all, and if one is required we shall have ample time in which to get one out. In these circumstances I do not think that it is worth while spending our time, which may be wasted, in considering an Order in Council at present. / I R# T.

As regards the preparation of a draft Order-in-Council for the Trucial Coast we agree that this might now be prepared for consideration, and there seems no reason why there should not be only one for all the Trucial Sheikhdoms. Although any possible simplification in its terms will be welcome we doubt wnether in fact much simplification will be practicable, and we think that the Koweit and Qatar Orders will have to be taken as a basis. In the meantime our view is that new Muscat and Bahrein Orders-in-Council are more urgent and we venture to express the hope that efforts will first be concentrated on producing these. J.P.

Sir Trenchard showed this letter to me before he left for London and suggest- -ed that I might express my views briefly* ^ If I ma// say 30 I think it would be a mistake to with- -hold approval to oil concessions until the question of juris- -diction ida been settled. This would very likely cause even more opposition that at present exists on the Coast to the grant of further concessions, since it might appear tot he Shaikhs that the concessions were merely a means to the 'end of obtain- -ing British jurisdiction in their territory. I suggest it would be simpler to take up the jurisdiction question when rather more concrete action has been taken in the way of investigation and drilling by the Oil Company, i.e. when the flow of British and non-Moslem foreign subjects into the Shaikhdoms really begins. Even at present the Shaikhs seem to recognise in some rather vague manner that we have a shadowy jurisdiction over British subjects, and we could make use of this later to approach them in the blandest possible manner with a view to'putting the mat- -ter on a more definite basis n . 3. When the time comes for Orders-in-Council I suggest it J.C.Walton, Esquire, C.M.G*, India Office, Lendon* 4 A pR 1938 PICE2 * it would be advisable to draft something much simpler than the type we have been using.

We realise, of course, that the matter will require careful handling, but perhaps recent developments in connection with oil and the Air Route might provide the necessary opening for an approach to the Sheikhs, and it is for consideration whether it might not be advisable to withhold approval to any further oil concessions (including Sharjah) until the question of jurisdiction has been settled.
