Although Frederick Mercer Hunter provides no description for stick-gatherers, the woman’s ragged clothing and pose may have been intended to demonstrate that she is what Hunter describes on p. 33 as a ‘low-born Somali or [negro] (Jarbarti)’who undertakes ‘scavengers’ work’.The woman, posed in a studio with rocks about her feet and carrying a long walking stick, appears bent over under the weight of the bundle of sticks she is carrying. A twisted rope binds the sticks together and forms a harness about her upper torso. The woman is blind or has an eye condition which has clouded her retinas.Inscriptions:In pencil, upper left corner adjacent to print: ‘12’</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Frederick Mercer Hunter</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Aden</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Ethnographic heritage</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023400730.0x000004#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
