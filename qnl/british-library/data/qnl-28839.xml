BOTH internally and internationally 1932 has been a wretched year for Persia as for other countries, the south being especially afflicted by a drought which over a large area round Bushire entirely destroyed the spring crop and iiecessitated the importation of drinking water, as well as of corn, and then by unprecedented rainfall which caused widespread havoc in the Kerman district. The Lurs, already desperate as the result of the Government’s methods of ££ settling ” them, have been out for trouble and appear to be making quite a fair living by looting lorries, principally on the Dizful-Khorremabad road. No really successful engagement with them has been reported. At the same time the Government can take comfort from the fact that there are no signs of concerted action among the southern tribes. In other parts of the country there have been no sensational developments, just a steady advance towards absolute poverty punctuated by increased taxation, by the National Bank scandal, by the arrival of the Persian ££ fleet,” by a considerable order for British military aircraft, by plans for the acquisition of artillery, armoured cars and tanks and for the rapid completion of the railway programme, by talk of raising the army to 100,000 men, and by the strange and disquieting methods employed by the Shah to add field to field to the Imperial properties in North Persia. 2. Externally, the only solid achievement was the settlement of the long standing frontier dispute with Turkey. Other events were : The ratification of the commercial treaty with Soviet Russia, which has done nothing to prevent a steady deterioration in the commercial as well as political relations between the two countries; the State visit of King Feisal, which was not marred by any untoward incident; the resumption of Anglo-Persian negotiations, which made some slight progress in matters of secondary importance, but were not materially assisted, as they should have been, by the transfer of the Imperial Airways route to the Arab coast, and which, after being nearly brought to an abrupt end by a sudden demand by the Persian Government for the evacuation of Hen jam, were left in a state of suspended animation when, on the 27th November, the Minister of Finance formally announced to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company the can cellation of the D'Arcy Concession; and, in the last days of the year, the fall of Teymourtache. 3. The facts regarding these events are related in full detail, in so far as they are known, in the body of the report. It seems appropriate here to discuss the failure of Teymourtache to bring our general treaty negotiations to a conclusion, the Shah’s decision to cancel the Anglo-Persian Oil Company concession, as the two matters principally affecting British interests, and the dismissal of Teymourtache as an event of outstanding importance and significance. 4. When Teymourtache’s absence in Europe at the beginning of the year became unexpectedly prolonged, Tehran gossips were heard to say that he had exhausted his credit with the Shah and was afraid to return. There was, as subsequent events gradually revealed, probably some truth in this gossip : the administration of the country had for so long been a ££ two man show,” that it seems possible that the Shah was surprised and pleased to find that the machine continued to work without Teymourtache in close attendance. Teymourtache certainly did not appear at the time of his return in January to have any suspicion that “the King’s countenance was changed towards him,” and he undoubtedly believed that in his negotiations with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company he had done an excellent bit of work for his Sovereign (which was true enough). More over, when he left London he certainly seemed convinced that the time was ripe, the commercial treaty with the Soviet Government having been concluded, to reach a political settlement with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India. 5. Looking back on these negotiations, there does not seem to be any moment at which Teymourtache definitely decided that he could not obtain a satisfactory treaty. There is no doubt that from the very beginning of the negotiations five years ago he firmly believed, as a strong nationalist, that Persia was entitled to receive more than His Majesty’s Government were willing to give, but if the negotiations had proceeded more rapidly and he had thus reached the conclusion5 [8706] b 3 is at least some expert support for the view that he achieved a notable success. However, when the agreement in final form reached Tehran for approval and signature, first Teymourtache boggled at it, maintaining that it was unintelligible; then, after the news reached Tehran that the royalty had dwindled to £307,000, from nearly £1,300,000, the company was informed that the Persian Government wished to reopen the entire discussion on a new basis, .^and that proposals would be submitted not by Teymourtache, but by Taqizadeh. **M'he company acquiesced, and then many weeks passed, until, on the 16th November, Taqizadeh informed the company’s resident director that he hoped to hand him the Persian Government’s proposals in about ten days’ time. At / the moment the Shah had not returned from the south, where he had been welcoming his fleet at Bushire. He arrived a day or two later, and attended a meeting of the Council of Ministers on the 26th November, and there and then the letter of cancellation was drafted. There is no reason to believe that either Teymourtache or Taqizadeh knew of his intentions. An intensive exchange of correspondence ensued between His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government, who flatly refused to withdraw the letter of cancellation as an indispensable preliminary to direct negotiations between the company and the Persian Government, both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Taqizadeh, who made no effort to convey the impression that they approved the cancellation, making it plain that &lt;£ the King’s decree ” could not possibly be changed. And so His Majesty’s Government eventually referred the matter to the Council of the League of Nations under article 15, and the Council, at the instance of the Persian Government, deferred the consideration of the question until the January meeting, after obtaining an assurance that the material status quo would not be disturbed. 9. With regard to motives, it can be said, with complete confidence, that auri sacra fames {alias, a wretched royalty) was the finger that fired the explosion of the Shah’s act. It can be guessed, with a fair probability of being right, that the Shah had throughout the year been making up his mind to rid himself of that turbulent Teymourtache; hence, perhaps, his endorsement of Taqizadeh’s opposition to Teymourtache’s settlement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company; and then Taqizadeh failed to get on with the job. Meanwhile, the Shah had, in the south, discussed railway problems, which revolve round money, and in which he takes a fanatical interest, and he returned to Tehran resolved to get money and to tear down Teymourtache’s spider web of negotiation and intrigue, or, a modern Alexander, to cut the Gordian knot. 10. The preceding paragraphs suggest that Teymourtache’s dismissal was due to general causes rather than to any particular reason or any definite act. From the moment of his fall, on the 24th December, the wildest rumours began to circulate, ranging from his being in British or Sovietic pay, to the Shah having sent him a message that his dismissal had been necessary for high reasons of State, but that he must have no misgivings, as the Shah intended to consult him as freely as in the past. Teymourtache’s political obituary notice, if his career is really over, belongs to the annual report for the current year. All that need be said here is that, if the Shah breaks, wfithout showing abundant cause, the man who, for better or worse, has in all matters of civil administration and international relations stood at his right hand for six years, the evidence that there is no room for energy and ability in Persia so long as Reza is on the throne will be overwhelming. II.— Foreign Relations. United Kingdom. &lt; A &gt; British Em 'P ire - 11. Anglo-Persian relations are dealt with in detail in the section on “ General Treaty Negotiations ” and “ Special British Interests,” particularly in the sub-section entitled “ Anglo-Persian Oil Company.” 12. Generally speaking, these relations improved steadily, being especially cordial at the time of the visit of His Majesty’s High Commissioner in Iraq in April, until they were suddenly strained almost to breaking point by the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s concession at the end of November.7 [8706] b 4 22. During the year the Persian authorities appear to have broken up a widespread Sovietic intelligence service, and a number of junior Government employees were convicted of selling information. These investigations directed attention to the question of propaganda, and it appears probable that General Ayrom, the energetic chief of police, has at last succeeded in winning the Shah round to his view that the propaganda menace must be taken more seriously than leading members of the Government have been willing to do. *^,neral Ayrom has, if he is to be believed, taken steps to tighten up the control of all known Communists, and a wary eye is kept on the activities of the Soviet diplomatic and commercial representatives. These steps, so he told the acting oriental secretary, had brought upon him the avowed hostility of the Soviet Embassy. 23. There appears to be little doubt that during the year under review the treatment of refugees from the Soviet Union by the Persian authorities improved considerably. Earlier reports had shown that, though the reception of refugees escaping to Azerbaijan was on the whole reasonably humane, the treatment of those entering Khorassan was frequently deplorable, but, as the result either of unofficial representations made both by His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and by Lieutenant-Colonel Barrett at Meshed, or of the deterioration of relations with the Soviet Government, a marked improvement in the treatment accorded to refugees in Khorassan has been noticed. 24. The situation of the Persian authorities is by no means enviable, since they fear, first, that Ogpu agents may be introduced among the refugees, and, secondly, that if they allow the refugees to enter Persia the Soviet authorities will create frontier incidents as a reprisal. The situation is, moreover, complicated by the fact that the majority of the refugees entering Khorassan are Turkoman tribesmen, uncivilised and unruly, an intrinsically undesirable element in a half-civilised country. 25. In March a frontier incident took place at Bilasavar in Azerbaijan. Details are wanting, but there appears to have been a clash between the frontier guards, probably caused by Soviet troops following up refugees into Persian territory. Both sides were soon reinforced, but the tension apparently died down, though the Russians were reported to be holding a strip of debatable territory on the frontier. T urkey. 26. There was a great improvement during the year in Turco-Persian relations, brought about by the signature of a frontier agreement which removed at a stroke the worst causes of friction between the two countries. 27. Discussions which might evidently have lasted for ever had been in progress for a more convenient definition of the frontier in the Ararat region between the General Stall's of the two countries, but it was not until the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs decided, as he put it, that a moderately satisfactory settlement was better than no settlement that agreement was reached. Tevfik Riistii Bey, accompanied by a small staff of four persons, accordingly arrived in Tehran on the 18th January, and by the 24th January it was possible to issue a communique stating that the agreement had been signed the day before. 28. The agreement provides for three frontier modifications. By the first, which was by far the most important, the control of the whole of Little Ararat (an area of which Turkish troops had, however, been in possession for some time) is given to Turkey; this cession will probably enable the Turks to deal effectively with the Kurds in the area. 29. The second deviation, in the neighbourhood of Kotur, added some 90 square miles to Turkish territory. 30. The third, near Bajirgan, had been the main difficulty. By this modification the Persians gained some 80 square miles of valueless country. 31. On the whole Turkey came better out of the exchange of territory. 32. At the same time a treaty of arbitration and conciliation was signed.■MW 8 33. In October Feroughi, after attending the meeting of the Council of the League of Nations, paid a visit to Angora and exchanged ratifications of these agreements on the 5th November. Three more agreements were signed on this occasion: a treaty of friendship; a treaty of neutrality and of political and economic co-operation; and an exchange of notes recording a piovisional ^ agreement for extradition. 34. The first two are merely intended to renew in two separate docume^’* the treaty of friendship and security of the 22nd April, 1926, and the protocol attached to it of the 15th June, 1928. 35. Tevfik Riistii Bey also outlined a scheme for a mutual pact of non-aggression which should include the limitrophe countries of lurkey, Persia and Iraq and also Great Britain—the latter because “ her frontier was the. sea. The purpose of the Turkish Foreign Minister is apparently to prevent any possibility of Turkey becoming involved in a war, and notably in a wai between Great Britain and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; with this end in view it is apparently proposed to invite both the Soviet Union and Afghanistan to join the pact, which will not, however, contain any form of ‘ sanctions. A fghanistan. 36. The commissioners appointed by the Persian and Afghan Governments to settle the Helmand water dispute (see paragraphs 42-45 of the 1931 annual report) apparently met early in the year and came to an agreement for the continued division of the water on the basis of two-thirds for Afghanistan and one-third for Persia. This agreement has, however, not yet been ratified by the respective Governments. Later in the year it was reported that difficulties had arisen over the line of the frontier in the area lying between the Hashtadan and Sistan demarcations. 37. In October it was reported that a mission from Afghanistan was shortly to visit Persia. It was to be headed by Shah Mahmud, the Minister of War, who is a younger brother of Nadir Shah. In December, however, it was learnt that the visit had been indefinitely postponed. 38. Inayatullah Khan returned to Tehran early in the year and was here in November, when a false report arose that he was leading a rebellion in the Southern Provinces. Germany. 39. The affairs of the National Bank and Messrs. Junkers are dealt with in paragraphs 407-414 and paragraphs 496-500 respectively. 40. In regard to the former, it is sufficient to say here that rumours began to circulate in the spring that all was not well; Dr. Lindenblatt, the general manager, applied for leave of absence, the general understanding being that he had resigned; after some hesitation, the Persian Government granted an exit visa. Shortly afterwards, his confidant, Herr Vogel, who was left in charge, fled the country in dramatic circumstances and committed suicide at Beirut. Dr. Lindenblatt was induced to return to Tehran (presumably under pressure from the German Government) to assist in the investigation of the affairs of the bank, which was still incomplete at the end of the year. 41. Herr Vogel’s escape had one interesting repercussion. His travelling companion, a German dentist named Schreinert (though probably quite innocent), was arrested and detained in prison for over a month before being finally released on bail. The conditions of the prison were revolting, and the counsellor of the German Legation was refused permission to see him on the ground that he was still under examination by the juge cVinstruction. The story is of interest in view of the tendency the Persian Government are now showing, to claim that the “ safeguards ” were intended only to cover an intermediate period, now happily over, when judicial and prison systems still left something to be desired. The general impression was that the German Legation handled the matter with insufficient firmness.9 42. In May the contracts of Herr Hartmann and some fifteen other Germans employed at the powder factory at Parchin became due for renewal and were cancelled. Herr Hartmann, who had been over eight years in Persian employ believed his dismissal to be due to the fact that just at the time his contrac came up for renewal the Persian Government lost a libel action m the Geiman courts against a Persian Communist who had made a personal attack on the Shah. 43. The Persian Government had, however, the satisfaction of winning another action in the German courts against a German newspaper, hhis case was heard in camera and the German press commented somewhat bitterly on “ The Public Prosecutor functioned on this occasion as counsel for the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, who were responsible for cairying it throug . It can only be said that the condemnation of a German citizen for libel m Germany against a foreign ruler will be regarded as a curiosity m the history of the German Republic. The monarch has won, the editor has been condemned, but German justice has suffered a severe blow in that, alter having resisted all pressure in the lower court, it did obeisance in the Court of Appeal to the might of higher officialdom/’ Sweden. 44. In February Captain Nordquist was appointed technical expert to the Military Bureau of the Persian Air Administration. 45. In accordance with the agreement arrived at with a group of Swedish industrialists (see paragraph 53 of the report for 1931), a M. Assarsson, who is the managing director of the svndicate formed under the agreement to barter railway and other material for Persian products, arrived in Tehran in September 1931. He immediately expressed his profound, and even violent, disapproval or Persian trading methods and Persia in general, and relations were soon strained to breaking-point. In order to placate him, the Minister of Finance met his most insistent demand, which was that he be granted export certificates for the Peisian produce he exported. Teymourtache, however, vetoed this proposal, and M. Assarsson thereupon left for Sweden to report to his principals. This was in February 1932, and M. Assarsson has not yet returned to Tehran, the affairs of the syndicate being left in charge of his subordinate, M. Nielssen. Italy. 46 Perso-Italian relations during the year under review were mainly concerned with the arrival of the new Persian war vessels m the Gulf, a subject dealt with elsewhere in this report. A small number of Italian officers and petty officers was retained as instructors in the new navy. 47 In April the new Italian Minister, Count Guido Viola di Campalto, arrived in Tehran. France. 48. There is little to report about French affairs. 49. In March the Majlis passed a Bill authorising the engagement of General Coulogner as Director-General of Public Hygiene The engagement is for three years, subject to three months’ notice. General Coulogner s functions are administrative as well as advisory, and he has wisely devoted the first months of his stay to a tour of the provinces. It is to be hoped that this appointment will lead to some amelioration of the conditions of the various quarantine stations. 50 The permission for the French c Air Orient to use the Peisian shore of the* Gulf expired automatically with that of Imperial Airways on the 30th October. After that date the French company were, however, allowed to continue to fly along the Persian coast on condition that special permission was obtained for each flight. 51. Meanwhile, the French Ambassador in London approached the Foreign Office to ask for the good offices of Flis Majesty’s Government m the United Kingdom in obtaining permission to fly along the Arabian coast. His Majesty s——'■ 10 Government agreed, subject to the condition that the French aircraft should conform to any regulations laid down by the local British political authorities. In November it was, however, learnt that “ Air Orient had, nevertheless, decided to continue for the present to fly along the Persian coast, the Persian Government having been at pains to ensure that the-service functioned smoothly. United States of America. 52. Perso-American relations during 1932 can best be described as havin^pT been characterised by irritability. For this there was, on the American side at least, due cause. 53. In June Mr. A. W. Du Bois, the representative of the Ulen Company in Tehran, presented to the Persian Government a final memorandum refuting the “ technical objections ” to the way in which the company had carried out their contract, which he had at length received privately from the Minister of Commerce, and announced that he had been instructed to leave Persia unless he received a favourable reply. No reply was returned to this memorandum by the Persian Government, but when, at the end of the allotted period, Mr. Bu Bois applied for an exit visa it was refused him on the ground that the Persian Government had, or might find they had, certain claims against the former syndicate and that, if he left, there would be no one responsible for answering^ these claims. The American Minister reported this refusal to the State Department and, meanwhile, efforts were made both by Mr. Du Bois and by the American Legation to secure the visa. Though Mr. Du Bois was twice informed by the Ministry of Communications that the police had received instructions to grant the visa, he found, on visiting the bureau, that no such instructions had been received. The exit visa was only granted after Mr. Hart had, on the instructions of the State Department, presented an extremely stiff note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Mr. Du Bois was then reluctantly permitted to shake the dust of Persia from his feet after a fruitless stay of four years. 54. It may, however, be regarded as certain that this is not the end of the matter, as in the autumn Mr. Hart, to his great delight, satisfied himself during a visit to Khuzistan that the only rails in use on the Southern Railway are those supplied by the company and rejected as defective by the Persian Government. 55. American interests were involved in a dramatic incident early in September, when the American consul at Tehran, who was accompanied by two members of the staff of the United States consulate-general at Jerusalem, was captured by Lur robbers between Kermanshah and Hamadan. They were marched into the hills, but managed to effect their escape when fire was opened on the brigands by a body of troops that happened to be in the vicinity. After a nieht of intense discomfort they succeeded in regaining the road, and thence Tehran by car, arriving very footsore, but otherwise unhurt. Mr. Hart expressed the satisfaction of the United States Government at the release of the prisoners by Persian troops and the hope that their possessions would be recovered. He did not submit any claim for damages. 56. The other main feature of Perso-American relations was the arrival in November of a Persian-born Russian-American Jew, Dr. Friedlieb, accompanied by a veritable circus of American experts in every branch of trade. This large party made a sensational arrival in Tehran in a specially chartered Imperial Airways plane. The object of Dr. Friedlieb is to interest American firms (through his company, the Persian-American Trading Corporation) in monopolies of various imports and exports, including tyres, lorries, skins, fruit and tea. These monopolies are to be obtained through the newly-formed “ Iran Trading Company ” organised by Teymourtache. Full details of Dr. Friedlieb’s activities are to be found in the Commercial Section of this report. N etherlands. 57. The permission from the Persian Government for the Dutch Air Line to use the northern shore of the Persian Gulf expired with that of Imperial Airways on the 30th October. After that date, however, the K.L.M. were allowed to continue to use the Persian route on condition that a special permission was obtained for each flight.11 58. In consequence, the Netherlands Government approached His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom with a request that the latter would use their good offices to assist the K.L.M. to obtain permission to follow the Arabian shore route. It was indicated, in reply, that the K.L.M. could not use Shargah in present circumstances, but that His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to approach the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Sultan of Muscat for the formal permission necessary to enable the Netherlands company to fly via Bahrein and Aadur. (They had hitherto been using the latter on the Persian route without such formal permission.) &gt; 59. Meanwhile the K.L.M. aircraft are continuing to follow the Persian route, but one or two disconcerting incidents have occurred when aircraft have been detained because the necessary permission has not come through from Tehran. The French and Dutch lines are combining to acquire wireless apparatus to replace that removed by the Air Ministry on the transfer of Imperial Airways. Japan. 60. On the 18th October a Treaty of Commerce and Navigation was signed at Tehran. The details of this treaty are not yet available, but it is believed to be quite commonplace. 61. The signature of this treaty w T as the last act of the Japanese Minister, Mr. Kasama, who left immediately afterwards to take up his new post as Minister at Lisbon. Mr. Kasama was hardly troubled during his tenure of the post at Tehran with the protection of Japanese nationals, though the non-official colony was increased by two representatives of the Japanese Opium Monopoly during the year, but he performed valuable work for his country by increasing Japanese trade with Persia to an amazing degree, mainly at the expense of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. 62. The Kazeruni case, of which mention was made in paragraph 73 of the 1931 report, dragged on inconclusively throughout the year. Belgium. 63. In October M. Cuvelier, the Belgian Minister, left Tehran to take up his new appointment at Sofia. His successor, M. Paternotte de la Vaillee, presented his letters on the 27th November. 64. A Belgian group have for some months been negotiating for a contract for a central electric power plant in Tehran, and also for a light railway which is to facilitate the transport of coal from the Shimshak mines to Tehran. Although the Persian Government showed a most reasonable spirit in the negotiations, the new Minister felt doubtful of the ultimate success of the project, especially after the example of the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company concession, and at one time he openly expressed the hope that Belgian money would not be adventured in a country the Government of which had no regard for the sanctity of contracts. The agreement was not signed until after the end of the year. Greece. 65. The protection of Greek interests continued during 1932 to give no little trouble to His Majesty’s Legation and consular officers. 66. The case of M. Dracos Pilides, the origins of which were explained in paragraph 81 of the annual report for 1931, dragged on fruitlessly throughout the year, the Legation being unable, in spite of great persistence, to obtain any satisfaction from the Persian Government. It soon became apparent that M. Pilides’s case had from a legal point of view been seriously prejudiced by the action of the assessors appointed by him to estimate the value of the cocoon-drying shed in concert with representatives of the municipality. These assessois, it is alleged, under threats from the police, gave the value as 300 tomans, and signed a statement to this eflect. It is thus evident that M. Pilides s chances of obtaining the 4,000 tomans claimed by him as compensation are slight indeed. At the end of the year His Majesty’s Legation were still waiting to learn the wishes of the Greek Government in the matter.12 67. In contradistinction to the foregoing, it is hoped that M. Pilides’s other claim—for compensation for the seizure of a tobacco-cutting machine—has been settled. The Tobacco Monopoly have agreed to pay the sum of 1,200 tomans in compensation, but the money has not yet been actually handed over, and until this has been done it is impossible to regard the case as definitely closed. 68. The Perso-Greek Treaty of Friendship (see paragraph 84 of last year’s report) was ratified by the Majlis on the 1st March. Ratifications have not^* yet been exchanged. Czechoslovakia. 69. In January it was rumoured that M. Bata, of shoe fame, was enquiring into the possibility of establishing a factory in Tehran or of combining with a group which was already ordering the necessary machinery. Since M. Bata’s death nothing further has been heard of participation by his firm. 70. In May M. Schubert, the Czechoslovak Charge d’Affaires, left Tehran. The post remained vacant until August, when a M. Vratislav Trcka arrived. Saudi Arabia. \ 71. In March the Emir Feisal, second son of Ibn Saud, went on a mission to Europe. On the completion of his visit, the Emir, who was accompanied by a staff of five, arrived in Persia from the Soviet Union on the 1st July. The Emir, who was the guest of the Shah during his visit, left Tehran for Bagdad on the 5th July. Egypt. 72. In October a new Egyptian Minister, Muhammad-el-Mufti-el-Gazaerly Bey, took up his post at Tehran. (C) Iraq. General. 73. The news of the entry of Iraq into the League of Nations was received in Persia with every appearance of cordiality. The Shah congratulated King Feisal by telegram, and the press devoted much space to the event, frequent allusions being made to the ‘ £ dear brothers ’' who had now obtained their freedom. 74. The Persian Government, at the request of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, had previously renounced in respect of Iraq the capitulatory rights they claimed, somewhat inconclusively, to have possessed in the former Ottoman Empire. 75. In November the Iraqi Government notified His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom that they would be grateful if British consuls could continue to protect Iraqi nationals in Persia, except in places where Iraqi consular officers were already stationed (Tehran, Kermanshah and Mohammerah). Sir Francis Humphrys's Visit. 76. Early in April His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Iraq, accom panied by Lady Humphrys and Miss Humphrys and bv Captain Holt, his oriental secretary, paid a visit to Tehran. The party flew up from Bagdad in a Victoria, escorted by two Wapitis. Sir Francis Humphrys received the most cordial reception from the Persian Government. The Shah entertained him to lunch, the Minister of Court, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and His Majesty’s Minister being also present. The Shah abounded in expressions of goodwill and of his desiie to establish the most cordial relations with Iraq. Two long conversations with I eymourtache and leroughi also took place about Perso-Iraq relations and, particularly, the Shatt-el-Arab frontier (see below). The Bagdad-Haifa Railway was also discussed, and Teymourtache asserted positively that in deciding on the gauge for this railway 'the Iraq Government could rely upon the Persian Government building a railway from Kermanshah to Khanaqin in the next few years.13 77. After a visit of five days, which were fully occupied with officiah and private receptions, Sir Francis Humphrys and his wife and daughter, who had already been delayed two days by engine trouble in the Victoria, left for Bagdad in three Wapitis. King FeisaVs Visit. 78. Sir Francis Humphrys was followed shortly afterwards by King Feisal, who arrived in Tehran to pay a State visit to the Shah on the 28th April. His Majesty, who was accompanied by a staff of eight persons, including Nuri Pasha, his Prime Minister, travelled by motor-car from the frontier. The visit, which lasted until the 1st May, was quite a success, though the Shah, judging by one or two indiscreet comments made by King Feisal, does not appear to have made a particularly favourable impression on his guest. In the course of such business conversations as took place, it was made plain to the Persian Government that no proposal for a frontier rectification would be entertained. 79. His Majesty, who had originally proposed to visit Meshed and who changed his plans at least four times before and during the visit, left Tehran for Khuzistan on the 1st May. He travelled via the Khorremabad road and proceeded direct from Mohammerah to Basra and Bagdad. • Frontier Relations. 80. Throughout the year under review the Perso-Iraq frontier was, as usual, the scene of incidents of varying importance. Many do not merit special record, but a few were of sufficient magnitude to be included in this report. 81. The most important arose out of the bombing of Tawila in December 1931 (see paragraph 114 of the annual report for 1931), in which Persian aeroplanes had dropped several bombs, killing and wounding a number of people. For three weeks the Persian Government did not even answer the original complaint, and when they did so, while expressing regret for the event, disclaimed all responsibility on the ground that the error made by the pilots was pardonable in view of the close proximity of the village to the frontier. The Iraqi Govern- ' ment nevertheless submitted a claim for 20,000 rupees for compensation. This was promptly met by a counter-claim for 100,000 rupees as compensation for nineteen Persian soldiers who had been killed in an action against frontier tribes in which it was alleged that 500 Iraqi tribesmen had taken part. Needless to say, the Iraqi Government contested this claim, but up to the end of the year they had obtained no satisfaction. 82. The Iraqi Government have many permanent sources of grievance against the Persian Government in regard to frontier affairs, and especially in regard to water rights. Near Mandeli, for instance, the local Persians have for many years been diverting from Iraqi territory a larger share of the waters of the River Gangir than the half to which the decision given by the International Commission in 1914 entitles them. A mixed commission appointed in July 1931 to deal with this question submitted a report to the two Governments, but the Persian Government have hitherto refrained from appointing a final commission as contemplated in the report, and so the question, which has been dragging on for over seven years, still remains unsettled. 83. A similar dispute over water rights arose in March 1931 at Zarbatiyah, where the Persian authorities caused a serious water shortage by building a dam across the River Gujam Cham, the median line of which is near the frontier. The Persian Government have so far refused to agree to the Iraq Government’s request for a joint investigation on the spot, insisting that they do not recognise the frontier as delimited by the 1914 commission. 84. A further frontier dispute has occurred in the area known as the Sharis lands, about 50 miles north of Basra. The exact situation is obscure, but there appears to be no doubt that the Persians have established a gendarmerie post on Iraqi soil. The Persian Government have again taken no steps to appoint a mixed commission and have taken refuge behind a cloud of counter-accusations. Finally, Feroughi, when pinned down by the Iraqi Minister at Tehran, remarked that it was useless to attempt a settlement of this and other minor incidents until the main question of the Perso-Iraqi frontier had been settled.14 85. The Persian consul at Khanaqin fell foul of the Iraq Government early in the year owing to his attempts to persuade an Iraqi tribe to migrate to Persia and pay Persian taxes. Remonstrances by the Iraqi Government were met, as usual, by an irrelevant excuse to the effect that the tribe was Persian in origin. The Iraqi Legation at Tehran were thereupon instructed to press for the replace ment of the consul in question. The latter had meanwhile left for Persia and, so far as is known, has not returned to his post. f* 86. In view of these and many similar incidents, it is impossible to escape the conclusion that the obstructive and even offensive attitude of the Persian Government in these questions is deliberate, and is designed to keep in the fore front the question of Persia’s “ right ” to frontier rectification. 87. On their side the Persian Government developed with the utmost vigour a complaint that Iraqi or British planes had made unauthorised crossings of the frontier near Bujaila. Subsequent investigation proved conclusively that no Royal Air Force aircraft had been in this neighbourhood, and the not very convincing suggestion was made to the Persian Legation at Bagdad that the aircraft were Dutch machines en route to the Indies. It so happened that later in the year some Royal Air Force machines did accidentally fly over and photograph Persian territory near Basra, but the circumstances were explained to the Persian Minister in Bagdad and nothing was heard of the incident. Tribal Migrations. 88. There is some hope that the vexed question of the Jaf migration (treated in paragraphs 99 et seq. of the annual report for 1931) has been settled during the past year. The Jaf were permitted by the Government, as the result of an agreement with the Iraqi Government, to spend the summer months in the Persian highlands on the following conditions : Certain selected chiefs were to reside at Bana under the eye of the Persian authorities; grazing taxes were to be paid at the rate of 1 rial for sheep and 5 shahis for goods; to these figures 20 per cent, would be added to cover cattle, horses and donkeys, which would not be counted, and 5 per cent, for customs; no arms were permitted unless specially authorised by the Persian authorities, but bearers of Iraqi rifle licences would be given Persian licences. On the whole the tribe appear to have been well treated during their stay in Persia. It is of interest that the Persian Government were moved to accord these facilities by the drop in revenue in the district in 1931, when few of the Jaf crossed the frontier. 89. Another tribal migration, that of the Harki Kurds, caused some anxiety to the Persian authorities in June. This tribe, which numbers about 15,000, crossed the frontier to Ushnu, south of Lake Urmiah, and refused to allow themselves to be disarmed. The Persian military authorities were too weak to overawe them, but with the aid of the local (Persian) Kurdish chieftains, an agreement was reached, the Harki Kurds giving guarantees of good conduct. Meanwhile, reinforcements of troops were despatched to the area in order to ensure that the agreement was kept to. Jaafar Sultan. 90. Jaafar Sultan (see paragraphs 112-113 of the annual report for 1931) surrendered to the Iraqi authorities early in January, the military pressure against him having proved overwhelming. The campaign was conducted in the depths of winter, and the troops suffered intensely from the cold. The treatment of their prisoners by the Persian authorities appears, according to reports from His Majesty’s consul at Kermanshah, to have been barbarous in the extreme. Jaafar Sultan only gave himself up on receiving assurances that his life would be safe and that he would not be handed over to the Persian authorities. The Persian Minister in Bagdad seems, however, to have misconstrued some remark of King Feisal’s as an indication that he would be surrendered, and to have telegraphed this to Tehran. This led to a strong demand for the surrender to be effected, and, when this was refused, a series of violent protests followed. The Iraqi Government, with the firm support of the Acting High Commissioner, refused to recede from its position. The Persian protests culminated in a note so menacing in tone and offensive in language, that its withdrawal was requested by the Iraqi Government. The unfortunate Persian Minister, who was betweentwo fires and afraid to explain his blunder, was, of course, unable to effect any compromise, and the matter was next taken up through the Iraqi Minister at Tehran. The latest information in the possession of the Legation is that Teymourtache had agreed to the withdrawal of the note on condition that all arms and looted property in the possession of the followers of Jaafar Sultan should be returned, and that the latter should be compelled to leave Iraq for Persia or -Syria. As far as is known, these demands have not yet been complied with, nor iSls the offending note been withdrawn. Treaties and Agreements. 91. A draft frontier agreement is under discussion between the Iraqi and Persian Governments. This provides for the appointment by both parties of frontier commissioners, who, in the event of disturbances or difficulties arising on the frontier, shall settle the matter locally, or, in case of disagreement, submit reports to their respective Governments. The Accord provisoire was prolonged until February 1933. A new Persian Minister, Mirza Seyyed Bagher Khan Kazemi, arrived in Bagdad in October with instructions to press on with the various agreements already under negotiation. These agreements are five in number :— (1) Treaty of Friendship. (2) Treaty of Neutrality. (3) Residence Treaty. . (4) Extradition Treaty. (5) Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. Drafts of all these were communicated by the Persian Government, and are now under examination by the Iraqi Government. Shatt-el-A rab {Political). 92. Early in the year His Majesty’s Minister expressed the opinion that, if the Persian Government came to learn that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had spontaneously advised the Iraqi Government to reject out of hand the request which they, the Persian Government, had made for frontier rectification in the Shatt-el-Arab (see annual report for 1931, paragraph 133), this might not only prejudice the general treaty negotiations on which he was then embarking, but prove detrimental to the best interests of Iraq by leading the Persian Government to take active steps to ruin the trade of the Shatt-el-Arab, by diverting the Anglo-Persian Oil Company tankers (upon which the Basra Port Trust depended for most of its income) to Khor Musa, and, if they realised its capabilities, by making difficulties in the Rooka Channel; the power of the Persian Government to take such steps was absolute already, and could not be increased by any territorial adjustment in the river. He therefore suggested that he should, in anticipation of the visit to Tehran of His Majesty’s High Commissioner in Iraq, explain to the Persian Government that they were wrong in supposing, as they had told the Iraqi Government was the case, that His Majesty’s Government had ever undertaken to secure anything approaching frontier rectification, but that His Majesty’s Government thought any practical disadvantages from which they suffered as a result of the present frontier could be met by a tripartite conservancy board; and should further propose to the Persian Government that they should, while accepting this board, agree to drop their frontier claim for three years and not revive it unless they found that their interests were not adequately safeguarded; the attitude of His Majesty’s Government would then depend upon Persia’s accepting as a servitude the unconditional and unrestricted use of the Persian part of the river by British warships and flying boats, the general state of Anglo-Persian relations, and the wishes of the Iraqi Government, whom there could be no question of coercing. 93. His Majesty’s Government considered, however, that the stakes at issue were too vital to admit of their giving any other advice to the Iraqi Government than that they should refuse to consider rectification, and it in any case became at once apparent that the Iraqi Government needed no such advice. It also so happened that, in the course of the treaty negotiations, the Minister of Court indicated that Persian aspirations in the Shatt-el-Arab might be met by a tripartite conservancy board.16 94. The terms of the draft convention were finally agreed to by all the interested departments in London in March, and were communicated to the Iraqi Government in the same month. On the 29th March the Iraqi Government agreed in principle to the representation of His Majesty’s Government on the Conservancy Board, though they expressed doubts as to whether this would be acceptable to the Persian Government. They hesitated over some of the police provisions, which appeared to derogate from full Iraqi sovereignty, but agre^l^j, that these might be discussed later. 95. This draft provided that the board should, for a minimum of fifty years, control the lighting, buoying, pilotage, dredging and navigation of the river, with powers to levy such dues as were necessary for these purposes; they might also enforce, by fines and otherwise, police and sanitary regulations, and retain vessels which had not fulfilled their obligations to the customs and other authorities of the riparian States; the board was to take over the assets and liabilities of the Basra Port Trust; a report was to be submitted annually to the three Powers, and a copy sent to the League of Nations; the convention was not to affect the rights and duties of the three Powers as neutrals or belligerents. It also provided that the three members should annually elect from among themselves a chairman, who should be eligible for re-election. Subsequent to the communication of the draft to the Iraqi and Persian Governments, it was proposed that an attempt should be made to secure an understanding that the British member should be both chairman and chief executive officer for the first ten years. His Majesty’s High Commissioner strongly recommended that Colonel Ward, the head of the Basra Port Trust, should be the first British member. An article in the original draft providing that the Iraqi Government might terminate the agreement if the volume of shipping using Persian ports fell below a certain figure was dropped by common consent before the draft was communicated to the Persian Govern ment, as likely to revive the territorial issue and be otherwise objectionable. 96. When the question of rectification had first been mooted, one of the counters with which the Iraqi Government had toyed had been an alteration of the frontier near Khanaqin so as to bring the whole of the Naft Khaneh oil-field into Iraq. Shortly after his return from Europe, Teymourtache, when discussing Sir Francis Humphrys’s visit, indicated that one of the points which needed clearing up between Persia and Iraq was this self-same section of frontier; he maintained that the commissioners of 1914 had failed to follow the directions of the Constantinople protocol in this area, and that the whole Naft Khaneh field should by rights be included in Persia. There was no apparent ground for this assertion. He also argued that the work of the commission had never been finished or ratified by Persia, and that the settlement had therefore no juridical force. This thesis is quite untenable in view of the terms of the Constantinople protocol, as Teymourtache virtually admitted immediately after he had advanced it. 97. Sir Francis Humphrys visited Tehran early in April and succeeded in obtaining from the Minister of Court a general acceptance of the principle of a tripartite conservancy board to deal also with the Haffar Channel and the Bahmanshir and with lighting and buoying in the Gulf; it was agreed that negotiations should open shortly at Bagdad and that, in the meanwhile, Mr. Carroll, the American engineer in charge of the southern railway, should visit Basra and study the technical side of the question with Colonel Ward. In the course of these discussions Teymourtache indicated that in his opinion there was a future for both Mohammerah and Bandar Shahpur, and that Bandar Shahpur might never have been developed had the Persian Government seen any prospect three or four years before of establishing friendly relations with Iraq. 98. The question may have been mentioned during King Feisal’s visit to Tehran at the end of April, but no developments of importance occurred. The Persian Government were, however, induced, with the able help of the Resident Director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, to drop their claim to the Naft Khaneh oil-field, and to be content with an arrangement as to the division of the royalty which would be much more profitable than a territorial ad justment, which would render the oil-field valueless.things in it he did not much like; it was, however, agreed that these points should be left for the technical discussions at Bagdad. 100. At this time the Persian Government were being pressed to arrange for Mr. Carroll’s visit to Basra to take place in time for their negotiator, the Minister of Justice, to be able to begin discussions at Bagdad on the 20th May (later altered J^the 27th May, owing to the unexpected retention of Sir Francis Humphrys at . Aieva). The day before the Minister of Justice was due to start, however, they were informed that the Iraqi negotiators, the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, were both ill and wished to postpone the negotiations until the autumn. This request, though eventually accepted, unquestionably dismayed the Persian Government, who suspected some ulterior motive. They had also been anxious that the board should be established before the mandate ended, a point to which His Majesty’s Government also once attached importance. 101. This feeling led the Persian Government early in June to inform the Iraqi Government that if the negotiations were postponed until after the entry of Iraq into the League, Persia would be debarred by article 10 of the Covenant from raising the question of the frontier in the Shatt-el-Arab and near Khanaqin; they therefore proposed, by a communication to the Secretary- General, to reserve the right to deal with these questions after Iraq’s admittance. This attitude was based on a misunderstanding of the effect of article 10, but the Iraqi Government returned a soothing answer that the postponement in no way altered their desire to reach a satisfactory settlement of these questions, and no more was heard of the matter. 102. On his return from Geneva early in November Sir Francis Humphrys wrote to Teymourtache saying that he looked forward to discussing with the new Minister the convention for a tripartite conservancy board, and reminding him of a suggestion made in the spring that his Highness should come for a cruise in the Shatt-el-Arab and study the points at issue for himself. 103. Later in the same month the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs passed through Bagdad and begged Sir Francis Humphrys to carry out the promise made by His Majesty’s Government and use his influence with the Iraqi Government to secure the alteration of the frontier in the Shatt-el-Arab from the left bank to the median line. He was told that His Majesty’s Government, though they had never undertaken to encourage frontier rectification, had certainly expressed their willingness to facilitate a solution of the Shatt-el-Arab problem, and for this reason had sponsored the scheme for a tripartite conservancy board, which would give Persia in practice all that she required, and which had been accepted in principle by the Minister of Court in the spring. Feroughi still seemed unsatisfied, and it appeared that he had also raised the question with the Iraqi Government, who later expressed some anxiety as to their neighbour’s intentions. 104. At the end of the year the question was in abeyance, the Persian Minister in Bagdad confining his attention to the other agreements under negotiation between the two countries. Shatt-el-Arab {General). 105. The only serious case of interference by Persian officials with vessels in Iraqi waters reported during the year occurred in April, when Mr. Bernard, the harbour-master at Abadan Reach, who was travelling in a motor-launch at least 100 yards away from the Persian shore, was called upon to stop by two Persian soldiers on the bank, who threatened to fire if he refused. Mr. Bernard went to the bank, and one of the soldiers jumped into the launch and ordered him to proceed to the Persian police headquarters at Abadan. Mr. Bernard, however, took the soldier to the Hormaq, whence he was later handed over to the Persian authorities. 106. The British employees of the Basra Port Trust living on the Hormaq, the hulk belonging to the trust that is moored just off the Persian shore, but in Iraqi waters, at Abadan Reach, were placed in a most difficult situation owing to the refusal of the Persian authorities early in the year to let them land without visas. As annual visas were unobtainable, and as the employees required to go [8706] c18 ashore each day, both on duty and for recreation, the cost of visas would have been prohibitive. The Persian authorities also made difficulty about the landing of mooring gangs. These new regulations were defended on the quite unjustifiable ground that the Hormaq had been used for smuggling into Persia both goods and persons without visas. The matter was put to Teymourtache during Sir Francis Humphrys’s visit in April, and he promised to arrange immediately for the issue of annual visas. But it was not until September, after five months of constai^^^ reminders, during which the staff of the Hormaq had suffered great hardships the heat of a Gulf summer, that the visas were eventually issued, suitable arrange ments for the points at which the employees might land in the course of their duties being also reached. A condition made by the Persian Government was that the Iraqi Government should grant annual visas for visits to Basra to a certain number of Persian officials. (D) International. League of Nations. 107. A commission of enquiry into the traffic in women and children, which had been visiting most of the countries of Asia, reached Persia in February. A representative of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs was attached to them throughout, doubtless in order to prevent them from seeing anything they ought not to see. The commission had no illusions on this point, but were nevertheless satisfied that, whatever the state of public morality within the country might be, there was no reason to suppose that an international traffic, with which they were solely concerned, existed in either direction. The commission travelled under the authority of the League of Nations, but the expenses were all met by the American Bureau of Social Hygiene. 108. In May the Persian Government communicated the statement of their land, sea and air forces required by the League questionnaire in connexion with the Disarmament Conference. The reply to Tables I and VIII (Land and Air Armed Forces Stationed in the Country) was, in each case, “ In process of organisation.” The answers given to Tables IV and XI (Formations Organised on a Military Basis) were 71,017 and 743 effectives respectively—on the 20th March, 1932. The naval forces were stated without equivocation to be 824 effectives. According to a previous communication made to the League in 1931 the Persian army when organised would number 72,000 men, so that, if the latest figures were correct, the total aimed at had been practically reached. There was strong reason to believe, however, that the figures were greatly exaggerated, perhaps in order to permit of Persia reducing her armaments, if required, on paper, without doing so in reality; the number of effectives was probably 15,000 short of 72,000. 109. The example of the Finnish shipowners’ case gave the Persian Government the idea of bringing before the Council the case of a certain M. Atychides, a naturalised Persian subject of Ottoman origin, who claimed some £900,000 for a ship, the Kara Deniz, condemned by the Bombay Prize Court in 1915. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs were informed that the two cases were in no way parallel, and that, even if the case were revived, His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom could not in any circumstances be compelled to arbitrate. This explanation may or may not have been responsible for the fact that the case was not placed upon the agenda for the September meeting, as the Persian Government had said it would be. White Slave Traffic Conventions, 1904, 1910, 1921. 110. The Paris Conventions of 1904 and 1910 and the Geneva Convention of 1921 regarding the Traffic in Women and Children were ratified by the Mailis on the 13th January, 1932, but the ratifications had not been deposited at the end of the year. International Agreement for the Prohibition of the Use of White Sulphur in the , Manufacture of Matches, 1906. 111. I he accession of Persia was voted by the Majlis, in first readinsf in December 1932. 6 ’19 [8706] c 2 International Air Navigation Convention, 1919. 112. In January His Majesty’s Minister received instructions to concert with his French and Italian colleagues in pressing the Persian Government to sign and ratify the protocols of the 15th June, 1929, and the 11th December, 1929; he was, however, given discretion to postpone his participation if he thought that such action might prove prejudicial to the chances of securing an extension of ~ ^piperial Airways’ permission to use the south coast route. His Majesty’s Minister thought it possible that the Persian Government might see a connexion between the two questions where none existed, and it was also pointed out in the correspondence that the only arguments that could be used in support of the request were those that showed the protocols to be more favourable to Persia than the original convention, in the sense of giving her greater freedom to exclude foreign air services or to exclude one service {e.g., Imperial Airways) while admitting others {e.g., the French and Dutch). Once his French and Italian colleagues had received their instructions, however, he considered it better to co-operate than to show hesitation. 113. A note signed by the three representatives was accordingly sent to the Persian Government under the date of the 22nd March. The note showed that the first protocol met the objections of all those States which had hitherto felt unable to accede to the convention, and that it was therefore most desirable that the Persian Government (with those of Chile and Uruguay) should make the convention universal by accepting the protocol, against which they had never raised objection. The fact that the second protocol benefited the British Empire almost exclusively was slurred over. 114. As a result of this demarche, Persia signed the two protocols, and, in November, His Majesty’s Minister received instructions to press the Persian Government to ratify them. It was understood that the French and Italian Legations would receive similar instructions. 115. It may be noted that, although Persia is legally a State party to the convention, notwithstanding that she has never ratified, and can so hold up the entry into force of amendments like the two protocols, the convention does not figure in an official list of international agreements to which Persia is a party issued by the Persian Government during the year. Obscene Publications Convention of 1923. 116. The Persian ratification of the “ International Convention for the Suppression of the Circulation of and Traffic in Obscene Publications ” of 1923 was deposited with 'the Secretariat of the League of Nations on the 28th September, 1932. Dangerous Drugs Convention, 1925. 117. The Persian ratification was deposited at Geneva on the 28th September, 1932. Arms Traffic Convention of 1925. 118. The attitude of the Persian Government to this convention (see annual report for 1931, paragraph 137) was again raised in October in the committee of the Disarmament Conference appointed to consider the questions of the private manufacture of arms and the convention itself. The Persian representative on this committee had previously stated these views ad nauseam to his British colleague, and, on the latter’s advice, he contented himselfj when the time came, with a formal reiteration of the Persian reservations, to which Mr. Carr was able to return a vague, but sympathetic, reply. Mr. Carr reported at the same time that there was little support among other delegations for the British view about the inclusion of the Persian Gulf in the special zones, and that considerable modifications seemed inevitable if the provisions of the convention were ever to come into force at all. 119. The Persian representative also raised the question of a bilateral arms traffic agreement, but was told that this was hardly a matter for the committee, and that the views of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would eventually be sent to Tehran.20 International Relief Union, 1927. 120. The accession of the Persian Government took place on the 28th September, 1932. General Act of 1928. 121. No steps were taken during the year to submit the General Act to tl^ Majlis, and an official of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs stated privately th® the Persian Government had no intention of ratifying it. Financial Assistance Convention, 1930. 122. The ratification of the Persian Government was deposited on the 28th September, 1932. 123. (E) List of Treaties, &amp;c., Signed, Ratified, Exchanged or .

It has now been ascertained that the exchange took place on June 22, 1931, as recorded above. (F) Propaganda. 124. The budget for 1932-33 makes no mention of press propaganda, but Item XVI includes the following items under “ Special Government Credits ” : Foreseen and unforeseen expenditure, 1,500,000 rials; secret expenditure, 200,000 rials; gratuities, 100,000 rials. Under Item XVIII (Undetermined General Credits) an amount of 3,500,000 rials is inserted for “ unforeseen expenses.” A few hundred tomans for press propaganda could presumably be debited under these heads. 125. The official Persian attitude is that the Persian press is entirely free. There is, however, a Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs named the “News, Press and Translation Department,’*’ and it is thought that this Department has something to say as to what the Tehran papers should publish. It is, however, well known that the police censor newspaper matter and also issue instructions, both permanent and ad hoc, as to what can, or cannot, be published. One of the permanent instructions is that no news of any revolutions in any part of the world must be published. 126. The various outbursts of anti-British sentiment which have been observed, both on the occasion of the announcement of the relatively small annual royalty of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and on that of the cancellation of the company’s concession, have, no doubt, been officially inspired. It does not appear, however, that any subsidy is now paid to either the Habl-ul-Matin at Calcutta or the Chihreh-Namd at Cairo. 127. Certain Persian schools are maintained, or subsidised, by the Persian Government in Iraq; on the 29th December the Majlis passed a law approving the expenditure of 33,000 tomans in this connexion. III.— General Treaty Negotiations. 128. At the beginning of the year the Minister of Court was on his way back from London to Tehran. Before leaving London he had given the Secretary of State an assurance that immediately upon his return he would strive to reach [8706] c 322 an agreement with His Majesty's Minister upon all outstanding questions, including that of Imperial Airways, and had added that, if a settlement were jiot reached before the 31st March, when the company’s permission to use the south Persian coast route expired, he would try to arrange a provisional extension as circumstances might require. Prior to his arrival in Tehran, the Foreign Office sent instructions to His Majesty’s Minister to the effect that the initiative in resuming negotiations for a general treaty should be left entirely to tlw. Minister of Court, but that, if he suggested their resumption, His Majesty^^ Minister should respond in a friendly manner and ask him to put forward definite proposals; in the event of his failing to take the initiative within about two weeks of his return, His Majesty’s Minister was to enquire whether he was yet in a position to arrange for a provisional extension of Imperial Airways’ permission. These instructions were largely based upon the impression which Teymourtache had given in London of being genuinely anxious to reach a settlement. 129. As it happened, Teymourtache, who reached Tehran on the 27th January, lost no time in offering to resume negotiations, and when His Majesty’s Minister paid his first call on the 29th January expressed his intention of submitting proposals at an early date, adding that the conclusion of a treaty should not present any grave difficulty. His immediate interest appeared, how r ever, to be centred in the Zahedan Railway, for when he returned the Minister’s call on the 5th February he suggested that the arrangement for the transfer of the Persian section (described in paragraph 222 of the annual report for 1931), combined, naturally, with the reopening of the railway as a whole, should take effect forthwith in anticipation of the rapid conclusion of a treaty. He reverted to this question at a reception the following evening, when he endeavoured to show that all the “concessions” which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India had made up till then were devoid of real value. His manner on this occasion, though perfectly friendly, gave the unmistakable impression of being adopted with the object of producing an “ inferiority complex ” in his fellow-negotiator; and, in order to discourage such tactics before the negotiations began, His Majesty’s Minister wrote him a private letter, making it unmistakably clear that His Majesty’s Government had no intention of dealing separately with the Zahedan Railway, which was a bargaining factor of some value, seeing that its operation constituted a liability rather than an asset to India, but an unquestionable asset to Persia. In the same letter he drew a comparison with Impel ial Airways, which His Majesty's Government had offered to regard as a counter to the Zahedan Railway, but which the Persian Government desired to link with the general negotiations, and showed that, while the continued existence of the southern route was undeniably important for His Majesty’s Government, its sole importance for the Persian Government lay in the fact that they could terminate it at their pleasure. This letter appeared subsequently to have had the desired effect. 130. The first meeting for the purpose of discussing the treaty took place on the 11th February, the Minister for Foreign Affairs being also present. The conversation was mostly confined to generalities, and Teymourtache gave the distinct impression of being willing to accept the treaty' approximately as it stood, if only some territorial compensation could be found for Bahrein, which, he maintained, might have to be disposed of by reference to some independent tribunal if direct negotiation failed. He was told that there was no hope whatever of His Majesty’s Government giving away Tamb or Abu Musa, which did not belong to them, and that the same insuperable objection existed in the case of the Shatt-el-Arab, which he also mentioned. He then admitted that Persian claims in the Shatt could perhaps be met by a tripartite conservancy board. Henjam, debts and the Bushire Residency were scarcely mentioned, but Teymourtache showed a disposition to make some advance in the question of visits by British warships to Persian ports. The only secondary point to be discussed at all fully was the abrogation of former treaties. Teymourtache stated that the reluctance of His Majesty’s Government to accept a formula wiping out all agreements earlier in date than the 10th May, 1928, had frankly made him suspect that they had up their sleeve some instrument, the existence of which the Persian Government had forgotten, and he also reiterated the objections of23 [8706] c 4 the Persian Government to mentioning specifically the Slavery Convention of 1882 and the agreement of 1919. His Majesty’s Minister replied that he was equally puzzled by the insistence of the Persian Government on so small a point, but that he would go into the question further. 131. A second long discussion took place on the 16th February, the principal feature of which was a suggestion from Teymourtache that His Majesty’s '•^^overnment should voluntarily withdraw their request for a lease at Henjam, a A course which would make it infinitely easier for the Persian Government to meet them over Imperial Airways. He was told that this was the first time during the negotiations that he had raised any objection to the general principle of the grant of facilities at Henjam, and that his suggestion was sure to be badly received by His Majesty’s Government. He did not, however, withdraw it, explaining that the combination of Imperial Airways and tlenjam appeared to Persian public opinion to give His Majesty’s Government a military position in Persia very similar to their position in Iraq, and that, while he personally thought this foolish so far as Imperial Airways was concerned, he fully shared the national dislike to Henjam. In reply, His Majesty’s'Minister dwelt upon the climatic advantages of Henjam, compared to other places in the Persian Gulf, and made it clear that the British warships could not lose the recreational and refuelling facilities which they had hitherto enjoyed there without grave inconvenience. He also asserted that to deny the use of the coast route to Imperial Airways, who could not, for practical reasons, use the route across the plateau, would be mere unfriendliness. The only other subjects of importance discussed at this meeting were the validity of the Perso-Iraq frontier as laid down by the International Commission of 1914, and the Bushire Residency. Teymourtache stated that the Persian Government were dissatisfied with the frontier in the neighbourhood of Khanaqin, and enquired why the Residency had not already been removed from Bushire in accordance with the agreement reached more than a year before. When His Majesty’s Minister explained that the transfer was part and parcel of a general settlement, Teymourtache said he might have misunderstood. 132. A third and a fourth meeting took place on the 18th and 22nd February respectively, at which the draft treaty was considered article by article. Article 1 was accepted by Teymourtache so far as the paragraphs providing for peace and friendship and for non-aggression were concerned; for the third paragraph, extending the effects of the article to the rulers of the Arab coast of the Gulf, he proposed the adoption of a formula describing these as the Heads of States “ whose contractual relations with His Majesty’s Government prevented them from alienating their territory to any other Power,” and the relegation of their actual names to an exchange of notes, a procedure which would, he said, reduce the danger of an awkward debate when the treaty was submitted to the Majlis for ratification. Article 2, regarding diplomatic relations, had already been agreed upon. For article 3 (Visits of Warships) Teymourtache produced a draft after some discussion for an exchange of notes to be attached to the article specifying the procedure to be observed for visits to the ports of the other party. According to this procedure, a request for authorisation had to be submitted through the diplomatic channel, but if no reply had been received by the date of the projected visit it might be assumed that it had been accorded tacitly. Article 3 bis (the Abrogation of Existing Treaties) had been dealt with previously, and in view of the uncertainty about article 4 (Henjam) no attempt was made to discuss the dependent protocol. Article 5 (Basidu) was already agreed, but a better wording was devised for the second paragraph about visits by British officials for the inspection of the cemetery. Article 6 (Wireless Stations) was already agreed upon. The first paragraph of article 7, providing for the recognition by the high contracting parties of the independence of Bahrein, was already agreed upon. Teymourtache now accepted subject to three minor changes, the wording proposed by His Majesty’s Govern ment for the second paragraph, providing for the grant of most-favoured-nation privileges to Persians in Bahrein and Bahreinis in Persia; he had previously jibbed at making this paragraph reciprocal. Article 8 (Tamb, Abu Musa and Sirri) was reserved for later discussion, while the subject of article 9^ Lighting and Buoying, had ceased to be a treaty question. For article 10 (Slave Trade) and the dependent protocol Teymourtache proposed simplified drafts, which24 made no mention of the convention of 1882, but did not affect the degree of co-operation, or the limitation of authority, already decided upon. A paragraph referring to territorial waters was, however, added. Article 11 (Zahedan Railway) was already settled in principle. For article 12 (Claims) Teymourtache proposed a formula providing for the signature at a future date of a protocol defining the manner in which the question should be liquidated; he explained that it was only a rough draft, but that he had in mind the establishment of claims commission with defined functions. No attempt was made to produce draft for article 13 (Debts). The subject of article 14 (Arbitration) was disposed of when the Persian Government signed the optional clause. Articles 15 (League of Nations) and 16 (Ratification) were already agreed upon. 133. A fifth meeting was held on the 28th February, at which Teymourtache and Feroughi agreed to the prolongation of Imperial Airways’ permission for two months until the 31st May, and it was decided to hold no further meeting until the replies of His Majesty’s Government to the various proposals put forward had been received. One more meeting, the sixth, was, however, held on the 13th March, just before His Majesty’s Minister left for a tour of the Persian Gulf. At this meeting Teymourtache explained the Persian dislike of the Bushire Residency, which was admittedly based on the confusion of ideas produced in the minds of the backward natives of those parts by the spectacle of a high British official ruling the Arab coast from a Persian town; he also said that the British proposal that, after the Resident had moved to the Arab coast, the Persian Government should still give him special facilities for supervising the work of British consuls in Persia was even more objectionable than his continued residence at Bushire. When His Majesty’s Minister pointed out that it was in the interest of the Persian Government themselves that the Resident should be of the calibre necessary to keep the more refractory of the Arab rulers in order, and that, if the Residency were removed to the Arab coast, it might prove difficult to find an official of sufficiently high rank and attainments to accept the post, Teymourtache replied that it might be possible to devise a means by which the Resident could spend a portion of the year on Persian soil, provided that his only connexion with the Arab coast during that time was by correspondence. There was also some inconclusive discussion about the treaty in general, Teymourtache stating definitely, as he had done on previous occasions, that much as the Persian Government wanted a treaty, they could not sign one without further concessions. 134. The question of the Shatt-el-Arab discussions which took place during Sir Francis Humphrys’s visit in April is dealt with separately. 135. In the meanwhile His Majesty’s Minister had sought instructions upon the various points as they arose, and an extensive exchange of views, which lasted the whole of the summer, and, indeed, the whole of the year, now began between the interested Departments of His Majesty’s Government and between His Majesty’s Government, the Government of India, His Majesty’s Minister and the Political Resident. The most pressing point requiring attention was that of Imperial Airways, and His Majesty’s Government were disposed to take the view that it would create a regrettable precedent for the operation of air lines elsewhei e if they were to appear to buy at a political price permission for the continued use of the southern coast route. This, in their view, the Persian Government ought to grant as a matter of international comity, and they thought that if I eymoui tache continued to try and use this question as a bargaining countei in the negotiations, the only way to bring the Persian Government to theii senses was to tell them that it had been decided to effect the transfer of Impel lal Airways to the Arab coast forthwith. It so happened, however, that Junkers suddenly ceased to operate at the end of March, and His Majesty’s Minister suggested that the south coast route might still be retained if he were to inform the Persian Government instead that, while His Majesty’s Government wei e unwilling to link Impel ial Airways to the general political negotiations, they were prepared to make a business offer to the effect that, if the Persian Government cared to utilise the services of a British air company to run an internal service in place of Junkers, they would be prepared to make this possible b 7 giving a subsidy for a limited number of years in return for security for25 Imperial Airways. Whether the offer became an accomplished fact was immaterial. The important point was that it should be made. At the same time he deprecated a suggestion that had been made by Imperial Airways that they should offer to fill the breach made by Junkers’ disappearance by running a Bagdad-Tehran service for three months without subsidy. His Majesty’s Government considered, however, that this offer would not only indicate too great — a dependence upon the Persian coast route, and thereby whet the appetite of the i'ersian Government, but would amount to paying a commercial price for the use of the route, which would in its way be as objectionable as paying a political price. His Majesty’s Government were also beginning to incline to the view that the Arab coast route possessed unsuspected advantages, especially as it had been discovered that it could be operated by land machines, and thought that the cost of transfer would be no greater, and probably less, than the cost of a subsidy. 136. His Majesty’s Minister was therefore instructed to deliver the message originally proposed. This was a matter of some delicacy, as Teymourtache had unquestionably thought throughout that His Majesty’s Government were willing to discuss the question of Imperial Airways along with the questions involved in the general treaty, and had probably granted the two months’ extension from the 31st March to the 31st May in the belief that His Majesty’s Government were considering his suggestion for a continuance of Imperial Airways in return for a voluntary relinquishment of Henjam. The question was yet further complicated by the fact that the necessary arrangements for the transfer of the air route to the Arab coast were still incomplete, and that a final extension of Imperial Airways’ permission was required, if possible, to the 1st October. 137. After these difficulties had been considered by His Majesty’s Government, the message was delivered on the 22nd May, a request for a four months’ extension being made at the same time. Teymourtache was told that, though the decision to move was definite, His Majesty’s Government would expect to receive the same facilities as other Powers if in the future the Arab coast route failed to come up to expectations. He received the communication without comment, and undertook to consult the Council of Ministers about the four months’ extension. This was granted three days later. It is possible that the refusal to link Imperial Airways with the treaty in general or Henjam in particular may have convinced Teymourtache that His Majesty’s Government were not so dependent on Persian goodwill as he had supposed. It is equally possible that the fact that he had got rid of Imperial Airways without having to give any sort of promise about Henjam may have encouraged him to think that he could as easily get rid of Henjam in due course. 138. At this meeting (the seventh) the nature of the facilities required by His Majesty’s Government at Henjam was discussed in some detail, and His Majesty’s Minister endeavoured to show not only that these were entirely commonplace, involving nothing in the nature of a base, but also that there was no reason why the Persian and British fleets should not share the advantages that Henjam afforded. Teymourtache made it pretty clear that if something could be done to satisfy Persian amour-yropre over Bahrein (he kept reverting to Tamb, which His Majesty’s Minister kept repeating was out of the question), Henjam should present no difficulty. His Majesty’s Minister in turn made it clear that without Henjam there was no prospect of His Majesty’s Government concluding a treaty. The discussion revolved on these lines for some hours, without any definite result, but, at the end, Teymourtache took a pencil and scribbled what he called “ all sorts of nonsense ” to the following effect:— {a) Frontier rectification in Baluchistan. \b) Payment by His Majesty’s Government to the Persian Government of some of 'the income tax derived from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. (c) Assistance in the purchase of military aeroplanes. (d) A promise of assistance in the purchase of warships, if the Persian Government added to their squadron, which was not their present intention. *i .v. . (e) A promise of goodwill in the event of the Persian Government wishing to raise a foreign loan in the future.vmmmsm 26 139. He wondered whether anything was possible on these lines. He also revived the question of the International Arms Traffic Convention (see annual report for 1931, paragraph 137), and suggested that, as this was never likely to come into force, and was in any case quite unacceptable to Persia, His Majesty s Government and the Persian Government should conclude a bilateral arms tralhc agreement, something like the Slavery Protocol. His Majesty s Minis er ^o' ^ ^ the opportunity of informing Teymourtache that the revised wording o Basidu article was acceptable to His Majesty’s Government. r 140. Shortly after this meeting His Majesty’s Minister suggested to the Foreign Office that an attempt should be made to deprive the Persian Government of the nuisance-value of their Bahrein claim by telling them that it the negotiations failed and Bahreinis in Persia were conscripted or otherwise subjected to annoyance, His Majesty’s Government would have no hesitation m taking them into court. This suggestion was based upon the assumption that it Bahreinis were in fact conscripted, His Majesty’s Government would have no other means of protecting them, and would be compelled m the end to adopt this course if their prestige and reputation for good faith among the Arabs ol the Persian Gulf were not to be seriously affected; and that there was nothing to lose, and something to gain, by making this clear to the Persian Government at the present stao-e. His Majesty’s Government were, however, reluctant to face the risk of bringing what was universally regarded as a worthless claim into general publicity, or of submitting it to decision by an international tribunal. 141. The question of a frontier rectification in Baluchistan was also considered but the Government of India decided that although a fairly extensive strip of country could be surrendered without any material loss or inconvenience, Indian public opinion would be dissatisfied if any part of Indian territory were sacrificed for ends which in India would be regarded as purely Imperial. 142. On the question of article 1, regarding the recognition of the Arab rulers His Majesty’s Government were prepared to accept in principle the proposals made by teymourtache at the fourth meeting, and on the 4th July His Majesty's Minister communicated to the Persian Government redrafts of the preamble, article 1 and the notes attached to article 1, embodying the alterations of form necessitated by the last Imperial Conference. 143. His Majesty’s Government were similarly willing to accept Teymourtache’s form of article 7 regarding Bahrein, and on the 17th August His Majesty’s Minister communicated to the Persian Government a final draft embodying the minor alterations necessitated by the Imperial Conference. The acceptance of this draft by His Majesty’s Government was stated to be conditional on a satisfactory formula being retained for article 1. 144. The Persian proposals for article 3 (Visits of Warships), article 3 bis (Abrogation of Former Treaties) and article 10 (Mave t rade), also formed the subject of correspondence during the summer between the Foreign Office and His Majesty’s Legation, and progress was made in preparing drafts of the articles and dependent notes which it was hoped might prove acceptable to the Persian Government. Teymourtache’s proposals for article 10 and the dependent notes were accepted in principle, and two alternative redrafts embodying corrections of form were sent to His M-ajesty s Minister m August foi communication when he thought fit. An opportunity did not arise at the time. 145. In the meanwhile the treaty position as a whole continued to engage the attention of various Departments of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India. A frontier rectifica tion in Baluchistan having been ruled out and the other four suggestions made by Teymourtache at the meeting of the 22nd being unacceptable for reasons both financial and general, it appeared that &amp; there was no further “sop” which could be offered by His Majesty’s Government, who were in any case averse m principle from offering anything of a substantial nature. The only possible lines of advance seemed to be an offer of docking facilities in India for the new Persian navy, and the conclusion of an anodyne bilateral arms traffic agieement. In addition, His Majesty’s Government were in principle prepared to throw in the last £510,000 of the war and post-war debt, but His Majesty’s Minister did not consider that27 this would prove a conclusive factor. It was generally considered at this time that, while there was little prospect of concluding a treaty, it should be possible, and would be desirable, to let the negotiations remain in suspense or die away in a friendly atmosphere, without any definite and dramatic break. 146. In spite of occasional signs of mild impatience from the Persian Xrovernment, no general reply on the subject of the treaty had been made-to them y the beginning of September, when the Minister for Foreign Affairs was due to leave to attend the Assembly of the League of Nations at Geneva. At a meeting held on the 7th September (the eighth) immediately before Feroughi’s departure, Teymourtache said he feared a deadlock had been reached. Everyone in Persia, from the Shah downwards, desired a settlement with Great Britain, but no Persian Government could accept an agreement that did not give them more adequate compensation for Bahrein than was at present offered. If agreement were impossible the Persian Government would, perhaps, have to seek arbitration over Bahrein, much as they disliked the idea. As regards Hen jam, he stated that the Persian squadron would be based there and seemed on the point of formulating a request for the withdrawal of the British depot when something occurred to interrupt the conversation. His Majesty’s Minister encouraged Feroughi to think that he might have an opportunity of discussing the treaty generally, ^though not in detail, with the Secretary of State at Geneva; and in reporting the conversation to the Foreign Office suggested that if Feroughi could be convinced by reasoned argument of the unsoundness of the Persian claim to Bahrein, this might do some good. 147. As a last effort to save the treaty and to ensure that, even if the treaty died, it should die peacefully, His Majesty’s Minister wrote to Teymourtache another private letter on the 9th September. In this he again reviewed the material advantages which Persia was to gain from the treaty, and invited him to consider whether, even if all these taken together did not seem to him a sufficient makeweight for the withdrawal of the Persian claim to Bahrein, he might not find the satisfaction he required in the treaty as a whole, which would bring about the disappearance of a host of insignificant questions, unworthy the attention of a busy statesman, as well as the consecration of friendly relations with Great Britain. Teymourtache did not reply to this letter in writing, but he later said that he had genuinely made every effort to find satisfaction in the “moral sphere,” on the lines suggested, but without success. 148. The next development was the receipt on the 20th September of a note from the Persian Government stating that the new Persian navy, which would be arriving shortly in the Persian Gulf, would need Hen jam for its own use, and requesting His Majesty’s Minister to arrange for the British naval establishments to evacuate the island without delay. To this His Majesty’s Minister sent an immediate reply, stating that he had transmitted this request to His Majesty’s Government and expressing surprise that the request should have been made at a moment when Anglo-Persian relations were about to be discussed at Geneva. This led to a second note, dated the 22nd September, which merely reiterated the request, adding that Feroughi’s conversations at Geneva were to be of a general nature only, and that as regards Henjam the grant of facilities had always been dependent on the successful conclusion of the negotiations, which had unfortunately not been realised. 149. In the meanwhile His Majesty’s Minister had had an important interview with Teymourtache on the 20th September (the ninth of the series). From this it appeared that the Persian request for withdrawal was not really final, and suggested that a way might still be found for the grant of facilities if only the question of Bahrein could be settled. Teymourtache asked for informa tion about the anchorage and shore establishments, and from this and other indications it began to seem even possible that the demand for withdrawal was not after all a political move, but was mainly due to the anxiety of the Ministry of War, under pressure from the Italian Minister, to find a base for the new navy. The Ministry, who had clearly done nothing to provide a base at Bushire and probably entertained the most exaggerated ideas of the depot at, Henjam, doubtless thought that to take the depot was the simplest solution of their difficulties. The interview concluded with the usual review of the “balance-28 sheet ” without any progress being made, His Majesty’s Minister firmly declining to entertain the various proposals which Teymourtache made for assistance in the purchase of aeroplanes or machinery. In general, Teymourtache seemed much more hopeful about the treaty than he had been at the meeting before Feroughi’s departure. At a further meeting (the tenth) on the 29th September, Teymourtache stated that both notes had been little more than reminders to His Majesty’s Government that the Persian Government wished to speed up the negotiations, a^N explanation which may not have been true, but at any rate made it possible to regard the negotiations as still in being. 150. The request for immediate withdrawal made the worst possible impression on His Majesty’s Government, and before they had heard of the interviews with Teymourtache they had enquired of His^ Majesty’s Minister whether a hint that he might be withdrawn in the event of the request being persisted in would serve a useful purpose. His Majesty’s Minister considered that the time had not come for any threat, and deprecated such a course on other grounds, including the improbability of its being effective and the difficulty of re-establishing full relations later on. As a first step he suggested that the Secretary of State should tell Feroughi at Geneva that, as the Persian Govern ment had never until now raised the question of Hen jam, although the negotia tions had been going on for years, they must have always contemplated the possibility of the two fleets sharing the anchorage, and that in consequence, so long as the negotiations were in being, the question of Hen jam could not be liquidated by unilateral action; if the request for evacuation were not withdrawn, the negotiations must be regarded as at an end : in that event a reasonable delay would be required for the preparation of accommodation elsewhere. This com munication was made by Mr. Eden, in the absence of the Secretary of State, on the 29th September; Feroughi said that he had not known that such a step was imminent, but maintained that the Persian Government still earnestly desired to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion. 151. On the 15th October His Majesty’s Minister received telegraphic instructions to the effect that it was necessary to ascertain at once how serious the demand for evacuation really was, and that, in view of the manner in which the demand had been made and of the fact that Hen jam was the only tangible asset that they stood to gain from a treaty, any continuance of the negotiations on lines implying acquiescence in the Persian demand was quite impossible. They were also impressed by the bad effect upon British prestige in Eastern countries which might be caused if the Persian Government were in a position to take the initiative in breaking off negotiations and so to suggest that His Majesty’s Government were suppliants to whom a treaty was more important than it was to them. They therefore instructed His Majesty’s Minister to present a note of which they sent him the text in a separate telegram. This text stated that His Majesty’s Government had never failed to recognise the legal right of the Persian Government to demand withdrawal, and that if the demand were pressed they would certainly comply as soon as alternative accommodation was prepared; this might take two years. It then went on to say that the demand must nevertheless affect profoundly and adversely the whole range of Anglo- Persian relations, including the negotiations, in which Hen jam was by far the most important of the desiderata of His Majesty’s Government; and that if the demand were not withdrawn and an adequate assurance given that the Persian Government would grant the facilities required, His Majesty’s Govern ment would consider the negotiations at an end and would conclude that British goodwill was of no importance to Persia. 152. His Majesty’s Minister suggested in reply that it would be very difficult to present a note in such terms after the explanations given by Teymourtache on the 29th September, that in any case Bahrein was a more logical and more presentable ground for breaking off negotiations, and that it might be sufficient to make an oral reply to the effect that as His Majesty’s Government could not meet the Persian demand for further compensation for Bahrein) tjhey had no choice but to regard the negotiations as finished, coupled with a thipt that the Persian Government might be content to suspend a final pronouncement on Hen jam until it was seen whether the two navies could not conveniently use it side by side. He was also of the opinion that in common29 courtesy time should be allowed for any communication that Feroughi might have made to his Government, as the result of the conversation at Geneva, to take effect. 153. His Majesty’s Government, though anxious about the early arrival of the Persian navy in the Gulf, expressed their willingness to consider an alternative draft note. A full discussion followed, in the course of which «^fcis Majesty’s Minister expressed the opinion that as few people in Persia, or presumably in England, knew that there were any negotiations in progress at all, and as they would know nothing about a breakdown unless one side advertised the fact, the question of who nominally broke off the negotiations did not appear of material importance. Finally, a formal reply to the Persian notes of the 20th and 22nd September was delivered on the 10th November, by which time the Persian navy had reached Mohammerah without affecting the negotiations in any way. This note stated that His Majesty’s Government had understood from the outset of the negotiations that the Persian Government were agreeable to meeting their wishes over Hen jam, that His Majesty’s Government unhesitatingly acknowledged Persian sovereignty at Hen jam, where they had never sought more than the continuance of certain harmless and modest recreational and fuelling facilities in return for an annual rent, that it was therefore clear that the Hen jam issue was inseparably connected with the negotiations, and that the negotiations could not continue unless the request for immediate evacuation were withdrawn. The note concluded with an assurance of the earnest desire (which they believed to be reciprocated) of His Majesty’s Government to establish Anglo-Persian relations on a basis of cordial co-operation. 154. His Majesty’s Minister was authorised in delivering this note to make it clear that His Majesty’s Government had no further general concessions to offer, but to hint at the possibility of reciprocal facilities for the Persian navy at Bombay or elsewhere. Teymourtache expressed pleasure at the note in general, but took some exception to the statement that negotiations could not be continued unless the demand were withdrawn. This could not, he said, be reconciled with the explanations he had given, but he was told that the note was a reply to a formal unqualified request for withdrawal and no objection to it could be raised on that ground. He repeated that the Persian Government were prepared to meet His Majesty’s Government over Henjam if only the treaty as a whole were of a nature to satisfy Persian public opinion that the Persian claim to Bahrein had not been surrendered for nothing. He went on to maintain that the British concessions, Sirri, Basidu, the Zahedan Railway, were not “ concessions ” at all; he admitted that the remission of three-quarters of the war debt was of importance. His conclusion was, however, that the war debt was not enough and that the refusal of His Majesty’s Government to consider any of his proposals for “ compensation,” even in a veiled form, was most disappointing. 155. In this same interview (the eleventh of the year) he harked back to a bilateral arms traffic agreement and asked whether this had been considered. His Majesty’s Minister replied that after some discussion with the Foreign Office he had submitted a draft convention for their consideration. Teymourtache then said that he too had prepared a draft, and produced a document which was in its main lines very like the Slave Trade Protocol, but had the drawbacks of describing territorial waters as 7 kilom. wide, and of making His Majesty’s Government declare that the Persian Gulf was not in the special maritime zones laid down by the International Convention of 1925. He was told that this would be submitted to His Majesty’s Government. The Legation draft, it may be added, followed the Slave Trade Protocol, but added a provision whereby, subject to certain conditions, warships of the one party might search vessels flying the flag of the other, provided a reply to a telegraphic enquiry had elicited the fact that no warship of the other party was available for the duty. 156. His Majesty’s Minister also took the opportunity of communicating a revised version of the draft notes regarding the visits of warships produced by Teymourtache at the fourth meeting. This version contained a provision ^ the effect that Persian local authorities should receive instructions to the effect that, if a British warship appeared in their port, they should assume in the absence30 of specific instructions to the contrary, that authorisation had been sought through the diplomatic channel and should raise no objection to the visit. At the same time he invited Teymourtache to re-examine the question with a view to accepting simple notification. 157. In reporting this conversation to the Foreign Office His Majesty’s Minister expressed the opinion that neither Teymourtache nor anyone 61^^ attached any real importance to the removal of the Residency from Bushire arr that, if this were the case, it might be possible to secure both Hen jam and the Bushire Residency, thereby saving an outlay of some £150,000, and settle Bahrein, if, in addition to the concessions already made, His Majesty s Government would remit the whole of the war and post-war debt, the payment of which they had long ago ceased to expect, accept an arms traffic agreement, which would cost nothing, and possibly agree to some limited expenditure (certainly less than £150,000) in assisting the Persian Government to buy arms or machinery in England. 158. No final decision had been reached on these points, when on the 27th November the course of the negotiations was dramatically checked by the note from the Minister of Finance to the Resident Director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company announcing the cancellation of the D’Arcy Concession. IV.—Special British Interests. (A) Persian Gidf. General. 159. In August a storm in a tea-cup arose over a foolish article upon British interests in the Persian Gulf by “A Special Correspondent of the Morning Post. This article expressed regret that, after the war, Great Britain, “ exercising the rights of a conqueror,” had not annexed the Persian coast from Bushire to Mohammerah, and the hinterland from there to Masjid-i-Suleiman (the oil-fields); and then went on to show that this misplaced restraint had placed modern Persia in the position of being able to pin-prick the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, build a navy which would probably be used for an attack on Bahrein, interrupt the air route to India, flout international practice in regard to visits by warships and built at Bandar Shahpur a deep-water port which could deflect from the Shatt-el-Arab much of the traffic upon which the port of Basra, a British institution, relied for its revenue. 160. It is unlikely that there are any subscribers to the Morning Post in Tehran, and the article was undoubtedly communicated to the press by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, together with the general line which they were to take in reply. The consequent articles were to the general effect that Persia had always known that Great Britain regarded the countries around the Gulf as parts of her Empire, and it was all to the good that this should be officially stated, as they now knew where they stood. The complaints of Persian obstruction were then examined in detail, and all possible capital made out of various misstate ments by which the writer had unwisely left himself open to attack. The articles, which continued for some days, also insinuated that the views expressed were those of His Majesty’s Government and the whole affair inspired by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company. 161. His Majesty’s Minister protested vigorously to the Minister for Foreign Affairs against the two latter insinuations, which were even less justifiable if founded on genuine belief, than if adopted as a matter of political tactics, and took him to task for provoking a quite unnecessary outburst, the object of which could have been quite well attained by enquiries in London. Feroughi admitted that the whole thing was regrettable, but said that he and his colleagues had been genuinely shocked by the suggestion that Great Britain, whom they had always, regarded as the chief upholders of Persian independence, from motives of selfi-interest as well as benevolence, cast covetous eyes on parts of Persia, and that the poor little Persian flotilla was a menace to the greatest fleet in the world. 162. The storm died down as rapidly as it had begun and left no visible trace on Anglo-Persian relations.31 Arms Traffic. 163. It was reported from San Francisco at the end of 1931 that a sample Thompson gun ordered by the Ghadr party (see annual report for 1931, para graph 161) had been landed in Persia. 164. Towards the end of October 200 rifles which had been brought by some Baluchis to Charbar in a dhow were seized by the military authorities. According different reports, they had been brought from Bombay and transhipped at sea from a foreign steamer. 165. The Persian Government proposed in the course of the year a bilateral arms traffic agreement with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom (see under “General Treaty Negotiations” and “Arms Traffic Convention, 1925”). Bahrein. 166. The Persian claim to Bahrein is dealt with under “ General Treaty Negotiations.” 167. Early in the year some correspondence took place between the Foreign Office and His Majesty’s Legation as to the proper reply to be returned by His Majesty’s Government—or by the sheikh—to a Persian demand for arbitration. It appeared that, even if His Majesty’s Government would be justified in the face of such a demand in replying that the sheikh was the person to whom the Persian Government must address themselves (through His Majesty’s Government), and however justified the sheikh would be in rejecting with scorn a suggestion that he should submit his independence to arbitration, the Persian Government could always find ways and means of bringing their claim before the League of Nations. 168. In the course of further inter-departmental correspondence the legal view was expressed that the article in the draft treaty by which Great Britain and Persia agreed to recognise the independence of Bahrein would constitute an engagement by Great Britain not to annex Bahrein, though it would not prevent the establishment of a protectorate. 169. In July the Persian Government revived, as though it were something quite new, their old complaint that Persian subjects were not allowed to land at Bahrein on “ Elm-o-Khabar ” (documents issued by the Persian authorities for travelling between one Persian port and another); they alleged that Persians had now, before leaving for Bahrein, to obtain permits through their acquaintances; this was alleged to be a breach of the status quo agreement of 1929. His Majesty’s Minister replied that the procedure to which objection was taken was expressly devised in the interests of Persian merchants resident in, or visiting, Bahrein; while all other foreigners, including British subjects, had to have passports and visas before landing, Persian merchants were allowed to land on the strength of “no objection” passes issued by the Bahrein authorities; otherwise, in view of the fact that their Government would not issue passports or recognise visas for Baffrein, they would never land at all. In any case, the procedure dated from before the conclusion of the status quo agreement. 170. In September the Persian Government took exception to the intention of the Government of India, announced in a circular from the Bureau of the Universal Postal Union, to use Indian stamps surcharged with the word “ Bahrein,” instead of plain Indian stamps, at the India Post Office in Bahrein; and they threatened that letters bearing such stamps would not be delivered in Persia. His Majesty’s Minister suggested that, if the stamps were not already in use, their issue should be unostentatiously delayed until the fate of the negotiations was somewhat clearer. This was agreed to by IJis Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. Later, the Political Resident reported that, in the opinion of the political agent at Bahrein, if the Persian Government carried out their threat, the only sufferers would be Persians resident in Bahrein and their correspondents in Persia. His Majesty’s Minister thereupon suggested that nothing should be said to the Persian Government until it were known whether the negotiations had failed or not, and that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should then be told orally that no reply would ever be sent to their note, but that, if the Persian threat were carried out, the only sufferers would be Persian subjects.I 32 171. The Persian Government were much exercised during the year over the affairs of Robabeh Sayyareh, a Persian prostitute deported from Bahrein under an edict closing the ranks of the profession to foreign women, and of a certain Lutfali Khonji, who had for some years been a partner with the sheikh in an ice-factory. N Bahreinis in Persia. 172. In May the Political Resident reported that, although the “ persecu tion ’ ’ of Bahreinis was not for the moment a burning question, it would become so whenever conscription started again in the Mohammerah area. He regarded the inability of His Majesty’s Government to protect these Bahreinis as seriously detrimental to British prestige on the Arab coast, and urged that if it were in any way possible this question should be disposed of as a separate issue. 173. His Majesty’s Minister considered that this could only be done if the Persian Government were warned that if, in the absence of a treaty, they were to go on conscripting Bahreinis in the future, His Majesty’s Government would have no option but to ask the League of Nations to intervene with a view to making them desist. He accordingly put forward the suggestion which is dealt with in paragraph 140 under ££ General Treaty Negotiations.” 174. It was estimated in May that there were 8,100 Bahreinis in the Mohammerah area, including women and children, of whom 2,300 owned agricultural land (which foreign nationals are not allowed to do). The number of Bahreinis outside this area is negligible. Basidu. 175. His Majesty’s consul at Bandar Abbas visited Basidu in January, and later reported that the line of the boundary was so uncertain that it was impossible to state that Persian taxes had been levied on any date gardens indisputably situated in the British area (see annual report for 1931, paragraph 174). 176. The first of the naval guards, which it had been decided in 1931 (see annual report for 1931, paragraph 171) should remain in the area for periods of a few days at irregular intervals, was landed in February, and similar guards were landed throughout the year. The senior naval officer issued instructions to the effect that these guards might be drilled and that the necessary dispositions might be made for the defence of the area, but that firing practices, either with ball or blank, should not be carried out; care was to be taken to do nothing that might give offence to Persian authorities outside the area, and the parading of armed men or posting of sentries near the boundary was to be avoided. 177. The inhabitants of the British area were rendered uneasy from time to time by rumours that the Persian authorities would try to conscript them, especially when a police inspector took a census of the neighbouring Persian territory early in the spring. No attempt seems to have been actually made to interfere with the inhabitants of the British area. 178. In September a new collector of customs at Persian Basidu was reported to be refusing permission for supplies of coffee, tea, &amp;c., to enter British Basidu, which he was logically justified in doing under the Trade Monopoly Law Regulations if he regarded British Basidu as foreign territory. 179. Further complaints of the activities of Persian officials were made by the caretaker to the Commander-in-chief, East Indies Squadron, when he landed there in December. 180. The intrinsic value of the British claim to Basidu was carefully re-examined during the year. The opinion of the Foreign Office legal advisers was that the permission originally accorded by the Imam of Muscat to the British authorities in the Gulf to found a station somewhere on the Island of Qishm would ordinarily have to be regarded as a revocable grant, and that the right of revocation passed from Muscat to Persia in 1855, when the Persian Government acquired or reacquired possession of Qishm. The position was, however, modified by the Anglo-Muscat Telegraphs Agreement of 1864, article 6 of which stated:33 [8706] d “ Nothing in these articles shall be held as invalidating .... the title of the British Government to ... . Bassidore, that station having been freely granted to the British Government by ... . my father, on behalf of himself, his heirs and successors.” This agreement was published at the time, and the fact that the Persian Government never made any protest might be held to have committed them to some extent to acquiescence in the view that the original grant was ^revocable. The value of Basidu as a bargaining counter in the general treaty negotiations was consequently regarded as somewhat higher than had been the case hitherto. Bushire Residency. 181. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Hugh Biscoe, the Political Resident, died suddenly at sea in H.M.S. Bide ford on the 20th July to the universal regret of British officials throughout Persia and the Gulf. His successor was Lieutenant- Colonel T. C. W. Fowle, political agent at Muscat. 182. Early in the year His Majesty’s Minister concurred in a suggestion emanating from the Government of India that the question of the provision of accommodation at Bahrein might be left in suspense until the intentions of the Persian Government became clearer. There were reasons for thinking that, if it became known that accommodation was being prepared at Bahrein before the question of Bahrein was settled, the Persian Government might in the interval make things difficult for the Resident. His Majesty’s Minister also had some hope of being able to arrange for the Residency to continue at Bushire. 183. Teymourtache, however, raised the question as soon as the treaty negotiations began, and, though he showed less interest in the question as the year wore on, he never said anything to indicate that he did not take it for granted that the removal of the Residency was a foregone conclusion. He half offered an arrangement whereby the Resident might spend a part of the year on Persian soil, provided he conducted his relations with the Arab coast exclusively by correspondence during that time. But he did not follow it up, and it is unlikely that it would prove practicable from the Resident’s point of view. 184. In the course of the discussions it appeared that Feroughi had mislaid or forgotten the draft exchange of letters providing for the Resident to receive, as inspecting consul-general, facilities for paying visits to the Persian coast, including the grant of an annual visa and the right of British warships to visit Bushire upon simple notification. A second copy of the draft was sent him, and when this came to be discussed Teymourtache indicated that such a proposal was far more objectionable than the continuance of the Residency at Bushire. 185. When reporting this conversation His Majesty’s Minister observed that for his part he shared Teymourtache’s objections. Though there was to his mind no valid reason why the Persian Government should object to the consul- general at Bushire having a second function as Political Resident for a territory outside Persia, there was every excuse for their objecting to such an unusual arrangement as that proposed in its place. Moreover, he felt considerable objection to the prospect of a British official situated outside Persia controlling the work and reports of consular officers under his superintendence, although he had no objection at all to the official in question receiving copies of such reports as interested him. 186. On two occasions His Majesty’s Minister thought it more prudent, having regard to the general negotiations, not to ask for special facilities for the Political Resident to leave or return to Bushire by flying-boat, as being likely to draw attention to the importance of the Resident on the Arab coast at a moment when the best hope of saving the Residency lay in drawing as little attention to this aspect of his duties as possible. Hen jam {Political). 187. Hen jam again played the leading role in the general treaty negotia tions, and the endless discussions that revolved around it are described in that section. Little need be added here except that the leading role was in this case that of the villain, whether regarded through British or Persian spectacles.34 188. During the year every opportunity was taken of explaining to Teymourtache the modest nature of the naval establishment, which included nothing remotely resembling a naval base. Teymourtache showed that he quite understood the nature of the depot, which he described as a “ gar^onniere,” but explained that the Persian attitude was not based on any material consideration, but on purely psychological factors. In September, after the formal request for evacuation had been made on the ground that the anchorage was needed for th^ Persian navy, His Majesty’s Minister gave him a copy of Admiralty Cha^^- No. 3597, showing “Henjam Sound,” and a plan of the shore buildings based on a sketch-map prepared by direction of the Senior Naval Officer in 1928. 189. In March the Protocol Department asked why the British flag was still flying at Hen jam, where there was no consulate (the fact that it flew from a flagstaff was not specifically mentioned) : and were told that this was a part of the status quo agreement, an explanation to which they demurred. At the same time it was suggested that if the question were to be raised, Teymourtache should raise it with His Majesty’s Minister, who was then in the Gulf. Nothing further was heard of the question, but in the subsequent discussions as to the line to be eventually adopted, the Admiralty expressed the opinion that if the Persian Government made the discontinuance of the flag a sine qua non for the grant of facilities, to comply would be preferable to leaving altogether. 190. In view of the uncertainty as to the continued grant of facilities at Hen jam, it proved impossible to make any progress with details, such as the terms of the suggested lease. His Majesty’s Minister formed the opinion, however, that the prospects of obtaining a formal lease were very remote, and that the most that might be hoped for was some assurance that His Majesty’s ships would be allowed to visit Henjam as in the past for the purposes of refuelling and recreation. His Majesty’s Government, while preferring a lease, appeared willing to accept this if nothing better could be obtained. Henjam {General). 191. Such incidents as occurred during the year were mostly due to the mistaken zeal or malicious perversity of the quarantine medical officer. On the 9th April the Anglo-Persian Oil Company tanker Khuzistan arrived in the anchorage and went straight alongside H.M.S. Fowey without waiting to obtain 'pratique. Although no communication took place between the two vessels, this was a technical breach of the regulations, and the Persian Government would have been quite justified in formulating a complaint through the diplomatic channel. The quarantine medical officer, however, notwithstanding the fact that he found the Khuzistan free from infection, took it upon himself to adopt what were, in fact, disciplinary measures, by refusing the Khuzistan pratique and placing the Fowey in quarantine for twenty-four hours. 192. A little later, on the 20th April, the same official refused to allow the agent of the British India Steam Navigation Company to go aboard the steamship Baroda or to permit members of the crew of H.M.S. Shoreham to collect mail and provisions brought by the Baroda for the Shoreham. He gave as his reason that the Baroda was in quarantine, but he allowed passengers to land and the mudir of Customs and the Admiralty tally clerk to go on board. The next day he explained that the ship had never been in quarantine, and that his orders were due to the fact that the ship’s deratisation certificate had expired. It was subsequently shown that the certificate was still valid on the 20th April, though admittedly due to expire in three days’ time, and that in any case article 28 of the International Sanitary Convention, under which the Persian Government later sought to justify his action, afforded no ground for such action, least of all by an official of a port not scheduled as possessing deratisation facilities. 193. Both incidents formed the subject of energetic protests at Tehran. 194. In June the quarantine medical officer informed the officer commanding H.M.S. Fowey, the only ship then in harbour, that in future all members of the crews of warships must either be distinguishable by their uniform or produce a written pass signed by their commander. The enforcement of such an order would have caused the greatest inconvenience, as the ships’ crews constantly landed in sports kit or in “tropical dress,” with which they wore no badges of rank or35 ships’ ribbons, and the Political Resident was able to secure from the Governor of the Gulf Ports an order for its postponement while the question was referred to His Majesty’s Legation. It seemed that what the quarantine medical officer had in mind was the enforcement of some regulations issued in 1929, one article of which provided for crews of warships to carry identity cards when landing. Sir Robert Clive had pointed out the objections to this article, which was at ^ariance with recognised procedure throughout the world, and orders had been jiven for the order not to be enforced. It also transpired that the immediate cause of the quarantine medical officer’s action was the recent arrival of one of the sloops with a civilian passenger (the Political Resident) on board without having given forty-eight hours’ notice. This was another provision in the same regula tions, but had never been enforced in the case of the Resident. Representations were made on both points by His Majesty’s Minister and no further cases of difficulty were reported. 195. In June also the Deputy-Governor complained to the senior naval officer that a liberty man from H.M.S. Triad had attempted to break into the custom-house and had threatened a policeman who tried to prevent him. At the senior naval officer’s invitation, a policeman was sent on board to identify the man, but failed to do so, so that the senior naval officer could take no action. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs repeated the complaint later to His Majesty s Legation, and this time it was stated that the object of the man in entering the custom-house was to assault the wife of the head of the customs, and that the senior naval officer had failed to take disciplinary measures, although the police man who went on board had identified the offender. Jhe account given was full of conflicting statements, and it was not difficult to show in reply that the lethargy of the Hen jam officials was solely responsible for the failure to identify the offender. 196. In the autumn arrangements were made to replace the eleven Royal Indian Marine ratings, who looked after the coal depot, motor launches, &amp;c., by employees with civilian status. Lighting and Buoying in the Gidf. 197. On the occasion of Sir Francis Humphrys’s visit to Tehran in April the Minister of Court, when accepting the general principle of a tripartite conservancy board for the Shatt-el-Arab, accepted also a proposal that the board should control the lighting and buoying of the Gulf outside the waters of the Shatt-el-Arab. The conservancy board itself is dealt with under ‘ ‘ Shatt-el-Arab frontier.” 198. The suggestion that there should be two boards under one president, or two sub-committees of the board for Persian and Arab waters respectively, had meanwhile been dropped; and the extension of the board s powers to points outside the Shatt was provided for in the draft convention, later communicated to Teymourtache, by a declaration that the board might, at the request of the authority or authorities from time to time responsible for the lighting and buoying of waters outside the board’s control, take over and maintain the lights and buoys in the waters concerned. 199. A certain amount of interdepartmental correspondence took place during the year as to the degree of importance attaching to the aids to navigation situated in Persian territory. It appeared that of the four lights essential for the navigation of the main route up the Gulf, Little Quoin, Tamb Island, Qais Island and the Shatt-el-Arab bar, only one, Qais Island, was in Persian waters, and as it consisted of a light ship, even it could presumably be placed outside territorial limits without difficulty. Jask light was also of use to general navigation, but not essential. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, whose tankers formed the bulk of the traffic using the Gulf, were anxious for additional lights at Farur shoal and Ras-ul-Mutaf; it seemed likely that these could be placed outside Persian territorial waters, at any rate at Ras-ul-Mutaf, but expert opinion differed as to the real necessity of such lights. The Political Resident drew attention to the fact that the amount of British shipping visiting Persian ports, though small in comparison to the amount going straight to the Shatt-el-Arab, was of considerable importance in itself and would be much handicapped it the lights and buoys at the intermediary Persian ports were not properly maintained. [8706] D 236 Naval Visits. 200. Early in January the Ministry for Foreign Affairs sent a reply to the representations made by His Majesty’s Legation in December (see annual report for 1931, paragraph 194), in which they stated that for the last four years the British consul in Khuzistan had applied to the Governor-General whenever a naval visit was to take place and that the latter after obtaining instructions from the capital had always given his consent; no change in the procedure had therefore taken place. The Ministers of Court and Foreign Affairs wer® however, brought to see that they had misunderstood both the terms of the 1928 arrangement for visits by ships permanently stationed in the Gulf and the object of the Legation’s representations. A corrected note was consequently sent saying that the local officials had been instructed to grant permission for visits on their own authority without delay. It subsequently appeared that the promised instructions had at any rate reached the Governor-General by Khuzistan. 201. A communication regarding a proposed visit by H.M.S. Hawkins, a vessel not permanently stationed in the Gulf, was made in the same form as for similar visits in previous years. 202. As regards the post-treaty position, the Minister of Court, in the course of the treaty negotiations, produced a draft for an exchange of notes (as reported elsewhere) specifying that before a naval visit took place ‘ ‘ une demande d’autorisation ” should be made through the diplomatic channel, but that, if no reply was received by the time the visit was due, it might be considered that permission had been accorded tacitly. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were disposed to accept this in principle, though still hoping for simple “notification,” and a revised version of Teymourtache’s draft was eventually given back to him, the chief alterations in which were : (1) An additional paragraph providing that the local authorities should receive instructions that if a warship arrived in their port they should assume, in the absence of specific instructions that the visit was not to take place, that a communication had been made through the diplomatic channel and raise no objection to the visit; (2) omission of the mention of terri torial waters; and (3) the omission of a provision that the object of the visit should be stated. His Majesty’s Government were, however, willing to state the object in practice. At the same time His Majesty’s Government decided that, whatever the Persian Government might do, they would not demand anything more than simple notification for the visits of Persian warships to British ports. Teymourtache was informed of this when the revised draft notes were sent to him. 203. The question of visits by Persian warships to Arab ports is dealt with in the section on “ Persian naval activity.” It may, however, be mentioned that when the vessels were about to leave Italy for the Gulf, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Legation that they would visit Aden and Muscat and other ports in words that amounted to nothing more than simple notification. A reply was eventually sent to the effect that the notification of the Persian Govern ment had been received by the Greek and Muscat Governments, for which the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed his thanks, the word “notification” being repeated. H.M.S. Ormonde and Sirri Island. 204. H.M.S. Ormonde was engaged in a survey along the Persian coast at the beginning of the year, and reported obstruction from the customs officials on the islands of F arur, Sirri and Qais, who had apparently received no instructions as to the landing of survey parties. Much valuable time was lost, while the Persian Government were being urged to send explicit instructions to their local officials. 20q. In October permission was sought for the Ormonde to resume her survey in Persian waters in the middle of November; and the same reservation was made with regard to Sirri Island as in 1931 (see annual report for 1931, paragraph 196). Permission was accorded, but only after an unofficial request had been made for her arrival in Persian waters to be delayed till the end of November. The reasons for this request were never stated, but it was quite evident that the object was to avoid the possibility of her being seen by the Shah, who was visiting the Gulf at about that time. The Ormonde eventually reached Hen jam on the 28th November.37 [8706] d 3 Persian Naval Activity. 206. In January the Italian Government replied to the British communica tion (see annual report for 1931, paragraph 198) about the activities of the Italian-officered Persian navy, asking that they might be supplied with the texts of the treaties governing the relations of His Majesty’s Government with the rulers of the Arab coast of the Gulf, in order that they might carry out their ^'•“^flifritention of regulating as far as possible their own political action in that area so as not to conflict with British interests. These texts were communicated to them in due course. 207. After considerable discussion His Majesty’s Minister was authorised in February to make, in a modified form, the communication to the Persian Government which he had proposed (see annual report for 1931, paragraph 199) should be made with a view both to counteracting the possible ill-effects that might follow if the Persian Government learned that a communication had been made to the Italian Government, and of intimating to them that if their navy visited Arab ports it would be expected to comply with ordinary international procedure. The suggestion for the re-definition of the status quo was not to be made, Tamb was not to be specifically mentioned and the use of words indicating that His Majesty’s Government 'presumed the Persian navy would wish to visit Arab ports was to be avoided. In other respects, however, His Majesty’s Minister was given discretion as to the language he used. At the same time the Political Resident was authorised to obtain from the Arab rulers declarations that they wished to receive notification before a Persian warship visited their ports, and these declarations were in due course collected. The opportunity for making the communication that His Majesty’s Minister originally had in mind had, however, passed, though the matter was broached tentatively with Teymourtache once or twice. The latter showed little interest in the question, though he indicated once that for such visits the Persian Government would follow ordinary procedure. 208. The Persian navy left Italy in September, the Persian Government having previously informed His Majesty’s Minister that they would call on their way at Corfu, Aden and Muscat and certain other ports, in terms that amounted to no more than simple notification. The squadron arrived at Mohammerah. via Charbar, Bushire and Bandar Shahpur—Muscat was, after all, omitted— early in November. 209. Shortly after its arrival the Political Resident suggested that in case the navy were to pay unheralded visits to the Arab coast the warning that the various rulers would require notification before a visit took place should now be delivered. His Majesty’s Minister, though he considered that at the stage which had then been reached a warning would in ordinary circumstances be unsound tactics, expressed his readiness, in view of the Political Resident’s opinion, to use the occasion offered by the receipt of instructions to communicate to the Persian Government revised draft notes regarding visits by British and Persian warships to the ports of the other party, to bring in the question of visits to the Arab coast. Teymourtache was accordingly informed that, though the draft notes made no mention of the ports of Arab rulers, it could be taken for granted that these rulers would at the very least expect prior notification before a Persian naval visit took place. 210. In the meanwhile the Political Resident gave the political agents the following instructions for cases of unannounced visits by Persian warships to the Arab coast:— (a) If no party were landed no action should be taken, though the Persian Government would be informed that the ruler concerned would expect notification another time. (b) Similarly, if a party were landed to purchase provisions, they should be allowed to do so. (c) If a ceremonial visit on the ruler or political agent were sought this should be refused. {d) If a party were landed not with the idea of actual aggression, but to assert a claim to ownership, this should not be resisted by force.Slavery. 211. No cases of slavery seem to have been reported during the year. 212. The Slave Trade Convention is dealt with under “General Treaty Negotiations.’- Tamb and Abu Musa. 213. These islands figured prominently “ incidents ” occurred. in the treaty negotiations, but (B) East Persia. Baluchistan Frontier. 214. In February the Persian Government suddenly announced that a party was on its way to Zahedan to survey the common frontier, and invited the Government of India to send a similar party to assist in the work. As His Majesty’s Minister was then about to reopen the general treaty negotiations, he suggested that the Government of India should comply. 215. The Government of India agreed at once in principle, and the Persian Government were so informed; and after an exchange of views with His Majesty’s Government the instructions that it was proposed to give to the British survey party were communicated to the Persian Government. These were to the efiect that they should co-operate with the Persian party in delimiting the frontier between “the junction of the Rivers Talab and Mirjawa ” and “ the nearest point on the watershed of the Mirjawa range,” the only points at which the agreement of 1896 admitted of any uncertainty. The communication added that, as the Persian party presumably included no plenipotentiary, the duties of the two parties should be to collect information and make recommendations, if possible jointly, to their Governments. The actual instructions given to Captain Bomford, the head of the British party, provided that the proceedings should if possible be limited to demarcation only, on the basis of the ‘ £ Holditch Agreement ” of 1896, but that the area might be extended, if the Persian party so desired, to include the frontier between Mirjawa Kuh and Kuh-i-Malik Siah. If difficulty arose as to the position of the point of junction of the Talab and Mirjawa Rivers (which appeared to be different stretches of the same water-course) he was to report for orders. 216. After some persuasion, the Persian Government agreed to let the British party’s armed escort enter Persian territory on the understanding that the Persian armed escort might, when necessary, enter British territory. 217. Captain Bomford met his Persian colleague, Sartip Abdul Razzak Khan, at Mirjawa on the 13th March, but discovered that he had no authority to do anything more than make a survey; the two parties accordingly limited themselves to this work. 218. Almost simultaneously the Persian Government informed His Majesty’s Minister that it was not their intention to restrict the survey to the north of the junction of the Talab and Mirjawa Rivers, but to survey the whole frontier from the Afghan border to the sea, and “to fix and specify in an agreement all the localities situated on the frontier of Persia.” His Majesty’s Minister suggested to the Government of India that if the Persian Government meant to carry out this survey it was desirable that a British party should accompany them to prevent mistakes, both intentional and unintentional, creeping into their maps and reports; and he went on to suggest that the reply to be made to the Persian Government should be that the Government of India would agree to demarcate the frontier where this had not already been done and to check previous demarcations (i.e., from Kuhak to Gurani : pillar 11), but could not agree to any general alteration of the lines laid down in the ‘ ‘ Goldsmith ’ ’ Agreement of the 4th September, 1871, and the “ Holditch ” Agreement of the 24th March-the 14th December, 1896, and confirmed in the agreement of the 13th May, 1905. His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India consented to continue the survey to the sea and to a reply on the lines suggested by His Majesty’s Minister, but the discovery that the Persian survey party had39 [8706] D 4 no authority to settle doubtful points, and the slow progress made, rendered it unnecessary to make any further communication to the Persian Government during the year. 219. Captain Bomford completed his survey of an area stretching from 7 to 10 miles on either side of the frontier from Kuh-i-Malik Siah to pillar 11 on the “ Holditch line ” (Gurani) by the 11th May, when he suspended his operations fgji view of the approach of the hot weather. His main map was on the scale of inches to 1 mile, and an additional map showed the Mirjawa area on the scale of 2^ inches to 1 mile. In the meanwhile his Persian colleague, who was elderly and not very robust, had begun a much more ambitious map on the scale of 1 :100,000 (about 1£ inches to 1 mile). It showed the flat ground very well, but its author was disinclined to enter the mountains. When Captain Bomford left on the 11th May his colleague had done little more than the area around Mirjawa, but expressed his intention of completing the whole area between Kuh-i-Malik Siah and Mirjawa before the end of May, which Captain Bomford thought impossible. Captain Bomford considered it would be a tactful gesture, as well as some insurance against error, if he were to give his Persian colleague a copy of his own map, and the Government of India approved of this being done. 220. In his subsequent report, dated the 7th June, Captain Bomford made some valuable observations upon the interpretation of the “ Holditch ” agreement of 1896. He considered that the “ junction of the Talab and Mirjawa Rivers,” undoubtedly meant the spot about 300 yards from the British post at Kila Safid (Padaha) where the Ladis watercourse met the main Mirjawa-Talab watercourse, though a more literal interpretation might place the spot further south, with resultant loss of British territory; even the saner interpretation would place Kila Safid just inside Persia. It was almost as difficult to decide upon the “nearest point on the Mirjawa Kuh,” but a point 1 mile north-east of the junction, at the foot of the nearest spur, was probably meant. By the “ water shed of the Mirjawa Kuh ” the commissioners of 1896 probably meant the range of highest peaks, one of which was stated to be on the boundary, though not really on the watershed. A literal interpretation would save the British post of Kacha, which otherwise became Persian territory, the line of peaks being to the east of the watershed, but this might make it difficult to insist on a more rational interpretation in the neighbourhood of Mirjawa. 221. The question of a possible cession of territory in Baluchistan as part of the treaty negotiations was also considered during the year. His Majesty’s Legation suggested tentatively that the frontier might be withdrawn (a) south wards along the old caravan route running to the east of the Mirjawa range and then along a line to the east of the Kuh-i-Rihi to pillar 11, or (b) southwards from a point on the Afghan frontier roughly due north of pillar 11, to pillar 11, leaving Nok Kundi on the frontier. The agent to the Governor-General saw certain objections to both these lines, but thought that the frontier could be withdrawn to a line running roughly northwards from Jizzak (a few miles east of Mirjawa) to the Afghan frontier, without surrendering any territory of the slightest value. The scheme was, however, dropped for political reasons. 222. In November three Persian officials proceeded to a point 2 miles east of Kila Safid and there tried to arrest an Indian who was supposed to have smuggled Persian currency past the customs post at Mirjawa on his way to India. They desisted when the Indian’s companions invoked the assistance of the levy guard at Kila Safid. A more serious incident at Pirau is dealt with separately. 223. The Persian Government had shown no sign of wishing to resume the survey by the end of the year. Extradition. 224. As a result of the case of Haji Nawab Khan (see annual report for 1931, paragraph 216), His Majesty’s Minister suggested that it might help to calm the suspicions of the Persian Government that refugees in Baluchistan were not kept under adequate control if an arrangement of the following kind were offered; whenever the Persian authorities informed the Baluchistan authorities that a “ rebel ” had escaped to British territory the man would be warned that, if he went back to Persia for any reason whatsoever and returned40 without a passport (a passport being proof that he had made his peace with the Persian Government), he would on the demand of the Persian authorities be handed to them. The Government of India agreed that such a suggestion might be put to the Persian Government, but later His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul suggested that such an arrangement might create an embarrassing precedent for similar demands from Afghanistan, and action was deferred. 225. Early in the year the Government of India reprimanded Political Agent at Chagaf for handing over to the Persian authorities without permission a man accused of robbery with murder. His two accomplices were forcibly taken back to Persia by a Persian gendarmerie officer (see paragraph 231). 226. In October the Persian Government asked for the surrender on grounds of courtesy of a certain Khan Mohamed, who had murdered a woman and her child, and in November sent very belated particulars of the crime for which they required the surrender of Lashgar Khan (see annual report for 1931, paragraph 214). The two cases were referred to the Government of India. Frontier Assistant at Mirjawa. 227. In March the Ministry for Foreign Affairs asked unofficially that a certain Abdul Rashid Khan, an ex-railway employee, residing at Mirjawa, might be sent back to India as he indulged in various objectionable activities, including the interception of telegraphic messages. Enquiries of His Majesty’s consul at Seistan revealed that the man in question was not a railway official, but in charge of the British levy posts along the frontier. He lived at Mirjawa because there was no suitable centre for him on the British side of the line; he had done so for some time, but his presence had become more marked since the withdrawal of the railway staff, for one of whom he may previously have been taken. For reasons connected with his telephone arrangements he could and did pick up Persian messages; but they could equally pick up his, though as he spoke in rapid Grahui they derived small information therefrom. No one ordinarily minded this, but one day he had unfortunately quarrelled with a close friend, a Persian customs official; the latter had reported him in a fit of pique, but later repented having done so. Finally, he was of great assistance to His Majesty’s consul, who would almost certainly be obliged to replace him by some sort of agent if he left, and to British travellers. His Majesty’s consul therefore hoped that it might be possible for him to remain on, and thought that as he was once again on the best of terms with the local officials this would prove possible. In consequence no reply was made to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, who seemed to have forgotten the question. Ghadr Party. 228. Amrik Singh, Tajammul Hussein and Nasib Singh remained in Tehran under surveillance until September. They were evidently told by the police that their detention was due to His Majesty’s Legation, so that after constant reminders His Majesty’s Legation were constrained to ask the Persian Govern ment either to make up their minds to deport them, to India or elsewhere, or to let them leave Tehran, where they were destitute. The alternative was to let them know that the Legation had tried to secure their deportation and failed. There was no doubt that the Persian Government were nervous of complying owing to fear that the Soviet Government might start to demand the deportation of refugees from the Soviet Union. Finally, however, all three men returned to India, Amrik Singh and Nasib Singh ostensibly of their own accord. 229. The Ghadr party continued to be active in certain parts of Persia, but did nothing sensational. Passport Control. 230. As a result of a visit that he had paid to the frontier in the autumn of 1931, the agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan recommended that the passport control at Zahedan should be abolished and the examination of passports undertaken at Kila Safid in British territory. The Zahedan control was accordingly discontinued in February.41 Piran Levy Post Incident. 231. In December 1931 three Baluchi robbers (British subjects) murdered two men on the road between Zabul and Zahedan. They fled to the frontier, and were pursued by the head of the gendarmerie at Zahedan, Sardar Juma Khan. Juma Khan, with fifteen men, crossed the frontier in pursuit, and reached the levy post at Lar. He asked the lance-corporal in charge to assist him in finding the murderers, and the lance-corporal willingly complied. Two of the men were ~^&gt;on found near the neighbouring post of ITran. Juma Khan then announced his intention of taking the captured men away to Persian territory, and when the lance-corporal said he could not allow this without reference to his superior officer, threatened to use force. The lance-corporal, being greatly outnumbered, had no choice but to let the men go. They were eventually executed. 232. An energetic protest was made against this high-handed action, and the Persian Government, after attempting to draw a red herring across the trail in the form of a doubt as to the line of the frontier, announced that Juma Khan had been given fifteen days’ hard labour. Post Office at Mirjawa. 233. The^Persian Postal Administration carried on during the year a prolonged correspondence with the Indian Postal Administration about the exchange Post Office at Mirjawa. They complained that this office exceeded the functions allowed it by the Universal Postal Convention, in that it made up bags of its own instead of simply transmitting the bags received by it from elsewhere. The Indian Postal Administration showed that this was perfectly in order, and finally stated, late in the year, that if the Persian authorities were unwilling to let the existing arrangement continue, the Mirjawa office would be closed and all mails sent and received by sea via Karachi. Zahedan (Duzdap) Railway. 234. The railway remained closed west of Nok Kundi throughout the year. 235. At the outset of the general treaty negotiations in February, the Minister of Court made an effort to have the railway reopened to traffic and the Persian section surrendered to the Persian Government, in anticipation of the early conclusion of a treaty. This request was refused (see paragraph 129), but the fact that it was made showed that the Persian Government attached considerable importance to the question. 236. This interest was, no doubt, partly due to the diminution in their customs returns caused by the smuggling which the closure of the railway encouraged, but partly, also, to the personal interest of the Shah. The head of the Railway Administration, when asking the Commercial Secretary at about the same time to obtain some specifications for railway material, explained that the Shah had ordered the immediate operation of the Persian section; while Teymourtache, when attempting in later discussions to belittle the importance of the railway to Persia, and its consequent value as a bargaining factor, said that he had only raised the question in the first place because the Shah, “who liked all railways indiscriminately,” had told him to do so. He had previously offered on behalf of the Persian Government to bear the loss on working the Nok Kundi-Zahedan section if the line were reopened provisionally. 237. The Government of India informed His Majesty’s Minister, in reply to an enquiry, that if at any time it became politically desirable to reopen the railway at short notice, this could be done in a few weeks. They also undertook to prepare in the meantime estimates of the material required for the operation of the Persian section, but, in order to do so, required to know among other technical points whether the Persian Government proposed to operate this section themselves and with their own personnel, whether there would be through traffic, „ and whether the Persian Government intended to undertake their own repairs. 238. A questionnaire was accordingly addressed to the Railway Adminis- ) tration, but the reply eventually received in April from the Minister of Communications threw little light on the Government’s intentions, except for a positive assertion that they meant to operate the Persian section themselves. It42 was however, believed that they contemplated the operation of through trains In the meanwhile, the Government of India had supplied the following provisional estimate:— (a) Value of material, tools and plant, less telephone and telegraph equipment, removed when the Persian section was closed (5) Four locomotives ... ... ••• ••• (c) Other rolling-stock, if all passengers and goods were to be transhipped at Mirjawa (d) and (e) Crane and breakdown equipment Total ... Rupees. 8,400 92,000 80,560 5,000 185,960 These figures were given to the Minister of Communications and there the matter rested till the end of August, when the Government laid before the Majlis a Bil to provide funds for the reopening of the Persian section. 239 This Bill stated that, as there was no provision in the current budget “ f or the working of the Zahedan-Mirjawa-Taftan Railway, built formerly by British officials and transferred to the Imperial Government or for the purchase of rolling-stock, . ...” a sum of 4 million rials was to be placed at the disposa of the Ministry of Communications for these purposes. While the Bill was still under consideration by the Budget Committee, His Majesty s Minister drew the attention of the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs privately to the fact that the transfer of the Persian section would not become effective until the general treaty were signed or a definite agreement reached to that effect, and that iattan was some way inside British territory. 240 The Bill was finally passed on the 13th October, the only fact of interest that emerged from the debate being a declaration by the rapporteur Ihni the sum df 4 million rials was intended to cover the value of the rails and material already on the spot, as well as new material and rolling-stock. If the figures already supplied to the Ministry of Communications were taken as a rough guide to the cost of new material, i.e., 185,000 rupees or some £14,000, the value placed by the Persian Government upon the railway was apparently about i/24,UUU. 241 Shortly after the passage of the Bill the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that the connexion of the railway with the general negotiations did not preclude the Persian Government from using the Persian section in anticipation of the coming into force of the agreement that had been reached. With regard to Taftan, he merely observed that the line of the frontier was already being surveyed by the two Governments. In view of this reply, His Maiesty’s Minister felt it necessary, in a formal note, to make all necessary reservations in respect of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government m the United Kingdom and the Government of India towards the question. 242 At the same time, His Majesty’s Minister expressed the opinion that ignorant though the Persian officials might be as to the political position of the railway, this ignorance, and its manifestations, such as the Bill, could be regaided with equanimity so far as Anglo-Persian relations were concerned, seeing that the reopening of the Persian section was a physical impossibility unless the Govern ment of India allowed the necessary rolling-stock to pass over their lines into Persia He added, however, that the Indian merchants in East Persia, who had at first welcomed the closing of the railway, were now changing their minds, and that it could not remain indefinitely closed without affecting the existing predominance of British trade and influence in South-East Persia. He therefore recommended that it should be considered whether it was worth disposing of the railway by sale and reopening the Indian section as a separate issue m the event of no general treaty being signed. 243. In December the Ministry of Communications wrote that the Persian Government accepted the prices given in the list of material sent to them m April, and asked that a contract of sale might be drawn up : this contract was to state among other points the place, date and method of delivery; the Ministry s letter also asked for information regarding the views of the Government of India in respect of an arrangement for direct traffic. His Majesty’s Minister suggested43 that there would be no harm in supplying a draft contract, but that the date of delivery should be left blank and the Ministry should be told that delivery could be effected at a stated interval after the date on which an agreement was reached between the two Governments for the transfer of the Persian section. 244. The question of a possible extension of the Zahedan Railway to Sistan, either at the same gauge or in the form of a decauville railway, was discussed ~ Airing the year. There was little doubt that these and other schemes were being examined by the Persian authorities, but details were not forthcoming. An official of the Ministry of Communications mentioned on one occasion that an extension to Kerman and beyond was under consideration. (C) Anglo-Persian Oil Company. 245. The annual report for 1931 stated that an agreement designed lo settle various outstanding differences between the Persian Government and the company and to give the former a larger share of the profits was reached when the Minister of Court visited London in December. Under a separate agreement the Persian Government were to receive a lump sum of £1,000,000 in settlement of all outstanding claims. 246. Teymourtache wrote to Sir John Cadman in March that these agree ments had been accepted in principle by the Council of Ministers, but it took some months to draft them in proper legal form, and it was not until the spring that the drafts reached Tehran and were communicated to Teymourtache. The latter first asked for explanations on a number of points and also for a further £50,000. When this sum was refused he abruptly declared the whole thing to be much too complicated, and, indeed, unintelligible, and asked that a representative of the company with full powers should come to Tehran to conclude the negotiations. For various reasons, however, the company could send no representative of the necessary standing, and it was agreed that the company’s proposals should be submitted to experts, named by the Persian Government, for examination, and, possibly, for simplification. This examination had not proceeded very far, how ever, when the general meeting of the company took place in June and the amount of royalty payable for the year 1931 was notified to the Persian Government. 247. This royalty proved to have dropped to £307,000, as compared to £1,288,312( 1 ) for the previous year, solely on account of the decline in oil prices throughout the world. The announcement gave rise to an immediate and intensive press campaign, in which the company were even accused of having deliberately defrauded the Persian Territory. Comparisons were also drawn between the sums received as royalty by the Persian Government and the sum received as income tax by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom; for a time it was not clearly understood that the income tax figure of £800,000 that was generally quoted, referred to the same period as that for which the Persian Government had received the large royalty of £1,288,312. In any case the Persian Government returned the royalty payment to the company and announced their intention of ordering a special, additional audit of the company’s accounts. To this the company replied that no suggestion could be more welcome. The story goes that in reply to a telegram indicating that the Shah was greatly upset at the smallness of the royalty, the board in London telegraphed back: “The shareholders of the company share your Imperial Majesty’s disappointment.” 248. His Majesty’s Minister let the Minister of Court know that the campaign was making a very bad impression, and a little later he wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who had made a singularly spiritless reply to an interpellation in the Majlis in which the company were accused of every kind of malpractice, that he hoped the Minister of Finance, who was to reply more fully in a few days’ time, would be at greater pains to remove what was an entirely false impression. It cannot be said that Taqizadeh’s statement, which was made on the 26th July, was much of an improvement, but he said nothing that was definitely objectionable. The only point of interest in the debate was the (!) This is the final adjusted figure : not £1,450,000 as stated in the annual report for 1931.44 argument used by some speakers that because it had been necessary to revise the Treaty of Versailles, the days when any international agreement needed to be regarded as binding had passed away. 249. At about this time the affairs of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were taken out of the hands of the Minister of Court and entrusted to the Minister of Finance, to whom they had always theoretically belonged. The agreements made with Teymourtache in London appeared to have been set aside, as, in Taqizadel^** opinion, not covering the whole field, but it was understood that counter-proposais were being prepared. On the 29th October Mr. Jacks delivered to Teymourtacha a message from Sir John Cadman, who was about to leave London for the United States, in which Sir John expressed the hope that these counter-proposals would be based on a full sense of realities and of equity, and gave an assurance that in this case they would be given the most careful consideration by the companj. Teymourtache replied that they would be entirely reasonable. 250. This message was repeated to the Minister of Finance on the 16th November, just after the return of the Shah from a visit to Khuzistan, in the course of which he had greeted Mr. Jacks, who was among those invited to meet him at Ahwaz station, in a markedly friendly manner. Taqizadeh replied that he hoped to be able to communicate the counter-proposals of the Persian Government to Mr. Jacks in about ten days’ time. In consequence of this assurance, less importance was attached than might otherwise have been the case to the renewal, following the Shah’s return, of the press campaign, in which it was stated not only that the concession ought to be terminated, but that it would be terminated, and that at an early date. 251. It subsequently transpired that the Shah, immediately on his return from the south, had ordered the Council of Ministers to annul the concession. None of his Ministers dared disobey, but Taqizadeh claimed later to have persuaded the Shah to include in the letter of cancellation an intimation that the Persian Government were in principle prepared to discuss the grant of a new concession. The letter, signed by Taqizadeh on the 27th November, was delivered to Mr. Jacks the same day. It stated that the Persian Government had repeatedly expressed its dissatisfaction with the D’Arcy Concession, which was prejudicial to the interests of Persia and had been granted in pre-Constitution days when such concessions were thoughtlessly given away without regard for the interests of the country. The Persian Government did not in consequence feel themselves legally debarred from annulling the concession; and as the company had never taken any practical step to safeguard the interests of Persia, they had decided to do so. At the same time the Persian Government had no other desire than to safeguard the interests of the country, and they would, therefore, not in principle refuse to grant a new concession that would take these interests into account. 252. The motives that induced the Shah to take this step are difficult to ascertain. He probably gave the order in exasperation at the smallness of the royalty and at the failure of Teymourtache, and later of Taqizadeh, to reach a conclusion after four years of discussion. The fact that Teymourtache, normally the only man capable of standing up to the Shah, was in disfavour probably facilitated its execution. Other theories, such as those that it was a gambler’s throw by Teymourtache to regain his position, and that it was engineered by the Soviet Embassy, are not supported by any of the available evidence. It is difficult to believe that such a decision could have been taken unless all possible consequences had been weighed; and yet it is probably true that the Shah hardly gave a thought to the effect of his action on Anglo-Persian relations generally. 253. The announcement of the cancellation was followed by “spon taneous ” celebrations in all parts of the country and by paeans of exultation in the press, the honour and glory being exclusively ascribed to His Imperial Majesty. The success of the national celebrations was ensured by police visits to every private house and shop, the owners being threatened with three months’ imprison ment if they failed to make an adequate display of decorations. His Majesty’s Minister informed Teymourtache and the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he understood orders had been given for the capital to be decorated. They strenuously denied that this was so, to which His Majesty’s Minister replied that he had certain proof, and that if the action were persisted in it could not fail45 to aggravate an already serious situation. ' The popular mind immediately deduced that the whole affair was a piece of play-acting to which the company were a party, the object being designed to ensure a smooth passage through the Majlis and through a shareholders’ meeting of an agreement that had already been signed. On the day following the cancellation, an Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany agent in Tehran reported that he had been ordered by a policeman to take Jipwn his Anglo-Persian Oil Company sign. His Majesty’s Minister made an ^Jergetic protest to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and two hours later the chief of police issued a general instruction that the company’s agents were not to be interfered with in any way. No similar cases were reported from the provinces, and it seemed probable that the Government had let it be known that for the moment everything was to go on as before. This was certainly the case with regard to the Customs, who were told by the Minister of Finance that no change * was to be made in the treatment of the company’s imports. In Khuzistan itself, the news was received calmly. The Minister of Finance also told a friend a few days later that if the company took no steps to comply with the cancellation order, the Persian Government for their part would take no steps to evict them by force, but would content themselves with “passive resistance.” 254. On the 29th November, Mr. Jacks, on instructions from the board, sent the Minister of Finance a formal reply denying the right of the Persian Government to cancel the concession and refuting the various arguments and insinuations in the note of the 27th November. The Minister of Finance replied very briefly two days later, stating that the cancellation was maintained. In a separate letter he announced that the post of Imperial Commissioner in London had been abolished and the services of Isa Khan Faiz dispensed with. 255. The Majlis met on the 1st December and unanimously passed a resolution congratulating the Government on its action. The Minister of Finance made a statement in which he attempted to justify the cancellation on grounds both moral and legal, and a number of Deputies described at great length the ways in which the company was supposed to have flouted the terms of the concession and sought the undoing of Persia. 256. Shortly after the cancellation had been announced His Majesty’s Minister had suggested that after a short interval he should present a note demanding the withdrawal of the cancellation and an assurance that no inter ference with the company’s operations should take place : a copy of this note would, at the same time, be communicated to the Shah, who would be given a memorandum to show how baseless the accusations against the company were, and would be told that His Majesty’s Government would resist any interference with the status quo, and, if necessary, appeal to the League of Nations. Simul taneously, the East Indies Squadron would move to the Gulf and the fact be advertised. If compliance was not forthcoming within a fortnight, the dispute would be referred to the League. 257. In the meanwhile, he had, on the 29th November, seen the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who had just returned from Geneva, and had impressed upon him as vigorously as possible the folly of the action taken by his Government immediately prior to his own return, and of the publicity and officially-inspired celebrations by which it had been followed. Feroughi attempted to lay the blame on the company, but admitted that he knew nothing about the company’s affairs and professed not to know whether his Department had been consulted. He suggested that as the Persian Government had indicated a readiness to negotiate a new concession, His Majesty’s Minister was taking the matter too tragically, and, finally, begged him to recommend a conciliatory attitude, but was warned to hope for nothing of the kind. 258. In the meanwhile His Majesty’s Government had decided that the original plan of letting the company' carry on the dispute alone could not be carried out, and on the 1st December His Majesty’s Minister received instructions' that a formal note was to be presented forthwith demanding the immediate with drawal of the notice of cancellation. His Majesty’s Minister was also to keep the Commander-in-chief, East Indies, informed of all developments. The note was presented the following day. It stated that the action of the Persian Government was considered by His Majesty’s Government to be entirely46 unjustified, and demanded immediate withdrawal of the notification : indicated that His Majesty’s Government hoped the Persian Government would try to reach a settlement direct with the company, and announced that they would not tolerate any interference with the company’s activities. The Minister for Foreign Affairs was upset and apprehensive, but stuck to the official attitude that the cancellation was fully justified. The Shah left the same day to attend the Turcoman races near Astarabad. ft* 259. In the meanwhile it had become evident, not only that the Persian Government were alarmed at what they had done, but that if His Majesty s Government insisted on literal compliance with their request for withdrawal, the effect might be to cause the downfall of the Government and even seriously com promise the position of the Shah himself. It was also possible that the Shah would only face the humiliation of withdrawal in response to a display of force. In these circumstances His Majesty’s Minister suggested that a bridge might be built whereby the Persian Government would be allowed to avoid the difficulty of literal withdrawal by substituting a note in which they would state that the cancellation was not intended to tie the hands of the company in any way in the forthcoming negotiations, and that the status quo would be fully maintained until such time as a mutually satisfactory conclusion had been reached. 260. On the 5th December a note dated two days earlier was received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs. This note stated that the Persian Government declined to withdraw the Minister of Finance’s letter of the 27th November, but repeated that they were willing to open negotiations with the company. In connexion with the warning given in the British note as to interference with the company’s operations, the Persian Government would not be responsible for any loss incurred by the company. 261. In view of the tone of this note His Majesty’s Government decided that they could not accept anything less than unconditional withdrawal, and on the 8th December His Majesty’s Minister addressed'a second note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs stating that no negotiations for a revision of the concession could take place unless the cancellation were annulled : he added that unless the Persian Government notified their intention to withdraw the cancellation by the 15th December, His Majesty’s Government would refer the question as an urgent issue to the Permanent Court of International Justice under the optional clause : and that in the meanwhile His Majesty’s Government could not accept the Persian Government’s disclaimer of responsibility for any damage that might ensue to the company, and would defend the company’s interests in any way that might be necessary. 262. The Persian reply to this note was dated the 12th December and received the same day. It was an immensely lengthy document, and began by setting out in detail, under nine heads and on lines already familiar, the grievances of the Persian Government against the company. It then intimated that the Persian Government would not have hesitated to accept a reference of the dispute to the Permanent Court of International Justice if the matter had been one which fell within the court’s proper jurisdiction as defined in article 36, but this was not the case. The note reiterated the refusal of the Persian Govern ment to accept responsibility for any losses which the company might suffer. The Persian Government asserted that His Majesty’s Government were preventing, by threats and intimidation and by unreasonable demands, a solution through direct negotiations between the Government and the company. This attitude was incompatible with the spirit that should prevail among members of the League of Nations, and they regarded themselves as within their rights in bringing to the notice of the Council of the League the threats and pressure directed against them. 263. On the following day His Majesty’s Minister had a conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which the latter suggested that negotiations might begin without the Persian Government actually withdrawing the cancella tion, but equally without His Majesty’s Government withdrawing from the position that they did not recognise the cancellation. He also explained that their note meant the Persian Government reserved the right to complain to the League of Nations if His Majesty’s Government were to press the threat to hold47 the Persian Government responsible for losses incurred by the company indirectly in their commercial affairs outside Persia; they now realised that they had mistaken the meaning of His Majesty’s Government; as regards the company s operations in Persia, there was not, and never had been, any intention to interfere. 264. His Majesty’s Minister gave Feroughi no encouragement to expect a &gt;nciliatory attitude, but as a result of this conversation, and of a somewhat similar conversation between the Minister of Finance and Mr. Jacks, he suggested to His Majesty’s Government that, though a crushing legal victory might be expected at The Hague, this would not necessarily serve the best interests of the company (upon whom the Persian Government could retaliate in many ways, such as oppressive income tax laws), and that it might be wiser to seek a solution by immediate direct negotiation, subject to a formula by which it would be agreed that if no agreement were reached by a given date the legality of the cancellation would be submitted to The Hague, and that the Persian Government would throughout afford the company all assistance in its operations. The negotiations would thus take place while the Persian Government were still conscious of their guilt and apprehensive of a court decision if they failed. 265. His Majesty’s Government had already decided, however, that, in view of the Persian attitude towards the Permanent Court of International Justice and of the terms of the Persian reservations to the signature of the optional clause, there was a danger of the proceedings being removed from The Hague to Geneva. In view of this danger, and of the desirability of appearing at Geneva as plaintiffs and not defendants, a telegram had already been despatched to the Secretary-General on the 14th December asking that the question should be placed, under article 15 of the Covenant, upon the agenda of the forthcoming meeting of the Council. The despatch of this telegram was hastened by the receipt of news to the effect that the Persian Minister in London had declared that his colleague in Switzerland was being instructed by his Government to address a “ protest ” to the League. The question was placed provisionally upon the agenda for the 19th December, and a statement of the British case, in which His Majesty’s Government expressed their desire to reach an amicable settlement, was communicated to the Secretary-General on the 16th December. 266. The correspondence with His Majesty’s Legation was read out in the Majlis on the 15th December, but no vote was taken. A statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs was devoid of interest except that it admitted that “ equity ’ should apply to the company as well as the Persian Government. 267. The decision to go to Geneva, inevitable though it was, undoubtedly restored some degree of confidence to the members of the Persian Government, who had hitherto been alarmed at the possible consequences of their master’s action, and, though slightly annoyed at being ££ forestalled,” were relieved to find that they were to be subjected to nothing worse than a discussion before the League. The press, which after its first outbursts had become more moderate, began soon afterwards to surpass its earlier efforts in vituperation. 268. On the 17th December the Persian representative at Geneva addressed a letter to the Secretary-General of the League, asking that the Council should defer its examination of this question pending the arrival of a special Persian representative, who would be sent from Tehran to Geneva with the necessary documents, &amp;c., as soon as the case of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had been considered by the Persian Government. After again protesting against ££ the methods of intimidation, not to say of threats, employed by His Majesty’s Government against the Persian Government, the letter went on to say that, as the Persian Government had not taken, and had no intention of taking, any measures against the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, there was no reason to consider the matter as urgent. 269. In view of this letter, and of the fact that under paragraphs 1 and 2 of article 15 of the Covenant the Persians were entitled to put in their case before the Council dealt with the merits of the dispute, the President of the Council was at first most anxious to postpone the Council meeting until the Persian case should have been considered. It was eventually arranged, however,48 that the president, after sending both parties the usual telegram expressing confidence that neither would allow anything to occur to extend or aggravate the situation, should also direct the Acting Secretary-General of the League to send a special telegram to the Persian Government, saying that the president interpreted the declaration contained in the Persian representative’s letter of the 17th December “as an undertaking by the Persian Government to avoid any modification of the present state of things which might aggravate the dispute/®* ^ and that a formal Council meeting should then be held to take note of ther^ above action. 270. The meeting of the Council duly took place on the evening of the 19th December, and the president read out the telegrams which he had sent to both parties, together with the special telegram to the Persian Government referred to above, at the same time repeating his hope that nothing would be done by either party to aggravate the situation. 271. Sir W. Malkin, who, in Sir John Simon’s absence through indisposition, acted as United Kingdom delegate, explained why His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom regarded the question as urgent; and, having expressed the hope that nothing would occur to render the earlier intervention of the Council necessary, submitted that His Majesty’s Government might fairly expect that the case of the Persian Government would reach the Secretary-General in time to allow the Council to take it into consideration at its next session, which was due to begin on the 23rd January. 272. The Persian delegate, on telegraphic instructions which he had received from his Government immediately before the Council met, made an anodyne statement, repeating his Government’s previous assurances regarding the maintenance of the status quo, and expressing the desire of the Persian Government to maintain friendly relations with His Majesty’s Government. He ended by expressing ‘ £ purely personally ’ ’ some doubt as to whether the matter really necessitated invocation of article 15 of the Covenant. The Council agreed that the question should be placed on the agenda of the session beginning on the 23rd January, the president intimating, in his concluding remarks, that the fact that the dispute had been brought before the Council did not preclude the possibility of discussions between the two parties meanwhile. 273. On the 20th December the Secretary-General of the League received a telegram from the Persian Government acknowledging the receipt of the telegram he had addressed to them on the 18th December, and stating that the Persian Government, in cancelling the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s concession,- “ had no intention of creating a dispute with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom under article 15 of the Covenant.” After repeating the Persian Government’s previous statement regarding its right to cancel the concession and its willingness to reach an equitable settlement with the company, the telegram added that the Persian Government would not fail to send a special delegate to Geneva to submit its case to the Council, and that meanwhile the Secretary-General of the League might be assured that ‘ ‘ the Persian Govern ment would continue to abstain from any act calculated to aggravate or extend the alleged dispute.” 274. In the meanwhile the Persian Minister in London had made more than one attempt, but without success, to induce Sir John Cadman to agree to the resumption of direct negotiations in Tehran and to go there himself. Ansari’s failure in this respect may have been responsible for the fact that he was recalled to Tehran very shortly afterwards, although another explanation popular in Tehran is that he had been suborned by His Majesty’s Government or the Anglo- Persian Oil Company to delay the publication of the Persian case in the London press, and had thus enabled His Majesty’s Government (it is not quite clear how) to get in first at Geneva. (D) Church Missionary Society. 275. At the end of 1931 the society had been successful in securing recognition for their schools in Persia, without which they would have suffered various disadvantages, even if they were allowed to keep open at all, e.g., pupils49 passing their examinations would still have been ineligible to sit for Persian Government examinations and still liable for conscription. There was, however, considerable delay in the issue of the papers confirming this recognition, and it was not until June that they reached Isfahan. Mr. Thompson, the principal of the Stuart Memorial College, then discovered that the recognition applied to his middle school only, and not to the primary school. Furthermore, the girls’ school i^fifelsfahan was not recognised because the Principal, Miss Aidin, was a Persian suoject. The Ministry of Education then explained that in the case of all non- Government schools it was the Principal, and not the institution, that received recognition, and that no Persian subject could be recognised as the Principal of a foreign school. They indicated that the difficulty might be surmounted in this particular case, but only for the middle school. The Persian Government intended shortly, so Mr. Thompson was informed in confidence, to forbid all foreign primary schools in Persia. 276. This prophecy proved correct, for in August a decree was issued forbidding foreign schools to admit pupils, whether boys or girls, who were Persian subjects. Mr. Thompson at once revisited Tehran, and in the course of this and various subsequent visits, during which a number of devices were considered, reached an agreement whereby the primary schools might be maintained under the guise of preparatory classes attached to their middle schools. The letter in which this arrangement was confirmed was dated the 3rd October, and stated that during the current year the Stuart Memorial College might admit into the middle school boys who were already in the primary school and had reached the fifth and sixth classes, even though not possessing primary certificates; in addition, boys already in the middle school who did not possess primary certificates might remain-there provided they passed the necessary examination in two years. A similar arrangement was authorised for the girls’ middle school in Isfahan and for the boys’ middle school at Kerman. The schools at Yezd and Shiraz had already been turned into Persian private schools under Church Missionary Society workers who were Persian subjects (the connexion of the Shiraz school with the society had, indeed, always been of a very tenuous kind). The only difficulty arose over the girls’ school at Kerman, which had no middle school, and consequently no way of disguising itself. The Principal, Miss Woodrofie, was able, however, in the course of a visit to Tehran, to secure permission to carry on until she went on leave in 1934. 277. There is little doubt that the decree was aimed largely, if not exclusively, at the Soviet primary schools, of which there were a large number. His Majesty’s Minister told the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he considered the exchange of notes about missionary work attached to the Tariff Autonomy Treaty of the 10th May, 1928, meant that the society’s schools then in existence would be allowed to continue. The American Minister also made representations to the Minister of Court. But in the end the missionaries arranged their difficulties without further official support. The attitude of the Persian authorities was definitely more friendly to the Church Missionary Society than to the American missionaries, against whose methods of proselytisation the Minister for Foreign Affairs inveighed in conversation with His Majesty’s Minister. (E) Imperial Airways. Political. 278. The negotiations for the continued use of the South Persian coast route after the 31st March are inextricably mixed up with the general treaty negotiations, and are described in the section on those negotiations. A provisional extension until the 31st May was obtained in February, and before it expired His Majesty’s Government had decided to withdraw to the Arab coast of their own accord; a formal communication in this sense was made to the Persian Government, in confirmation of an oral message, on the 26th May. This communication asked for a temporary and final extension until the 1st October, and stated that His Majesty’s Government did not consider themselves debarred, by their decision to withdraw of their own accord, from claiming most-favoured nation treatment on behalf of Imperial Airways in respect of any facilities accorded to other air companies in the future, or from inviting the Persian [8706] e50 Government to re-examine the question if experience revealed unexpected difficulties in operating the route along the Arab coast. Formal confii matron of the grant of an extension to the 1st October was given on the 10th June. 279. Previous to the decision to withdraw being taken, Imperial Airways had indicated that if a new agreement were concluded they would like to receive therein specific permission for extra flights over and above 104 a y e 3*, or establishment of emergency supply dumps at Charbar, Daiym ami Pi lam, for a regular landing-ground at Lingah, as well as some improvement m the issue of permits for the import of their stores. But the point of discussing a new agreement was never reached. 280 When Junkers ceased to operate at the end of March Imperial Airways offered to run a Tehran-Bagdad service for three months free of subsidy m the hope of influencing the Persian Government favourably m the matter or a permanent extension. His Majesty’s Minister considered, however, that such an offer would have no effect on the political negotiations, and might merely give the Persian Government an exaggerated idea of the eagerness ol Imperial Airways to retain the Persian coast route. 281. The stopping-place finally selected for Imperial Airways on the Trucial Coast was Sharjah. The consent of the sheikh, though he was personally well-disposed, was not obtained without difficulty, but an agreement was eventually signed on the 22nd July by Lieutenant-Colonel Dickson, the political agent at Koweit, who had been proceeding to Sharjah with Sir Hugh Biscoe, the I olitical Resident, when the latter suddenly died at sea. 282 The service along the south Persian coast ceased when the last west bound aeroplane left Bushire on the 27th September, but certain of their stores still remained, the company having only applied at the very last minute tor permission to export these stores without the obligation to furnish to the I ei sian Government the equivalent value in foreign exchange. 283. At the same time His Majesty’s Government decided not to give or sell to the Persian Government or to the French or Dutch air companies the wireless sets that Imperial Airways had used at Bushire and Jask; and these were eventually shipped to Basra, the export taking place m the name ot the company, although the sets, in fact, belonged to the Air Ministry. Registration. 284. The delay accorded to foreign companies for compliance with the Company Registration Law expired on the 8th April, but the Persian authorities agreed unofficially not to press for registration, or to penalise the company for delay in registration, until the future of their service, which was then due to terminate on the 31st May, became clearer. The company took no steps to register when the final extension to the 31st September was granted, and the Persian Government made no complaint. The registration fee, as they were a transport company, would in any case have been only a quarter of the usual fee. General. 285. The operation of the company’s service in Persia was uneventful. Fewer complaints were received of the conduct of the Persian Government wireless operators. Owing to the Trade Monopoly Law, great difficulty was experienced in providing the necessary food supplies for the company s passengeis duiing their halt at Lingah. (F) Imperial Bank of Persia. 286. The bank passed a relatively uneventful year, the main feature in which was the withdrawal of its note issue, which began on the 20th June and was completed on the 20th September. 287. The scandals connected with the National Bank enabled them to recover much of their former business. The affairs of the bank are dealt with in greater detail in the Economic Section.51 (G) Indo-European Telegraph Department and Imperial and International Communications Company. G ener al 288. The only remaining Indo-European Telegraph Department property, that at Shiraz, was sold in July. Telegraphs A greement. 289. The agreement recording the withdrawal of the Indo-European Telegraph Department from Persia and providing for the maintenance, by an agent to be named by His Majesty’s Government in the Gnited Kingdom and the Government of India, of cable stations at Bushire, Henjam^ Jask and Charbar until 1945 was signed on the 17th February by His Majesty s Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It was ratified by the Majlis on the 4th May and by the Shah in June; the Kings ratifications for the United Kingdom and India were received in September, but it was not possible to procee immediately with the deposit of ratifications because the Imperial and Inter national Communications Company were not yet ready to effect their registration under the Company Registration Law, as they would have to do as soon as the agreement entered into force, and the Persian Government were officially informed that they were the agents of His Majesty s Government for the operation of the cable stations. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs were finally informed at the end of November that the Legation were ready to proceed but further delav ensued a.s a result of the Legation s instructions to ask for the ratifications to be deposited instead of exchanged. The Shah’s decree apparently instructed his Minister for Foreign Affairs to exchange his ratification for that of the King and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs did not see how this older could be avoided, or understand why the Legation wished to leave with them the copy of the agreement ratified by the Shah. The ratifications were still undeposited—or unexchanged—at the end of the year. 290 In June His Majesty’s Minister informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that in his opinion, the word “station” in the agreement of the 17th February, which allowed the “ agent ” to maintain and operate the cable stations at certain points on the Persian coast, meant the stations as they existed on the 31st March! 1931, including all buildings and lands attached to each, °and that in Consequence,’the action of the Persian authorities in removing boundary posts of the Jask concession area as laid down m 1887 and electing hdldhgs within the area, of which he had just received a report, was contraiy to the agreement. A tths 291. In March His Majesty’s Minister asked that the company might keep the following arms at their stations : Bushire : Nil, Jask : 13 rifles, 1 revolver and ammunition, Charbar : 1 revolver and ammunition, a iW fbp ppmainder of the arms enumerated in paragraph 265 of the m F-f' Government, ..mewbn. surprisingly, gave the necessary permission almost at once. 992 Previous to this, an attempt was made by the Persian authorities to collect the arms’atClask, but the office? sent from Bandar Abb^ for this purpose desisted when told that the matter was under discussion at Tehra . 293 ? The Lady Denison Pender visited the Gulf m February. In asking asked that this cable should be examined a nd any neces y p ^ ^ 18706]52 294. Some difficulties occurred owing to the company having failed to indicate, in the first place, the full extent of the landing facilities required, but these were removed when brought to the notice of the Persian Government. Consular Functions. 295. During the year the Ministry for Foreign Affairs stated that upon making further enquiry in higher quarters they had ascertained that an appli&lt;^^ tion for permission to appoint the clerks-in-charge at Jask and Charbar honora^* vice-consuls would be unlikely to be regarded favourably. They stated, however, that there would be no objection to the officials of the company performing, in a purely private and unofficial capacity, certain simple duties such as transmitting passports, or passport applications and fees, to and fro between British subjects and the nearest consular officer. Official Stores. 296. The Persian Government finally agreed to admit all the items to which they had previously objected (see annual report for 1931, paragraph 268). But the procedure for securing permits under the Trade Monopoly Law still caused vexatious delays, and an unsuccessful attempt was made to obtain an annual quota for these stores, on the lines of that already obtained for private stores (see annual report for 1931, paragraph 269). The permits began, however to be issued more rapidly towards the end of the year. u i^ t '^ ie autumn ^ wa s discovered that the company had been in the ^ ^ °f paying customs duty upon all official stores, notwithstanding the terms ol the Telegraphs Agreement, which in other respects the Persian Government treated as though it were in force. As a result of local representations the customs authorities sought for instructions from Tehran and were told that official stores might be admitted duty-free, provided a special authorisation to this enect accompanied the import licence.

The wireless telegraphy station at Lingah was used for service messages only, an Indo-European Telegraphs Department operator being left in charge. 302. The Persian Government showed considerable interest in these stations dgring the year. At the end of 1931 they had asked whether they might take t^m over in advance of a treaty settlement, and in January the Ministry for Foreign Affairs were told privately that this was impossible. Later they asked for detailed information regarding the stations, and this was supplied. In September the Director of Telegraphs at Tehran asked the telegraph authorities at Karachi direct whether he might operate the unused Lingah station pending a settlement, but was told that this request should be preferred through the diplomatic channel. 303. His Majesty’s Minister expressed the opinion in September that though the Persian Government would be unlikely to put difficulties in the way of the importation by the Imperial and International Communications Company of spare parts necessary for the upkeep of the Bushire and Hen jam stations, a request for such facilities, which were not directly covered by the Telegraphs Agreement, might lead to a demand for the surrender of the stations v/ithout further delay, and, failing this, for this disuse pending a settlement. (H) Claims. General. 304. The mild successes recorded in the annual report for 1931 were not repeated in 1932, no single outstanding claim being settled. The great majority, it is true, remained in cold storage, but four of them, those of the Government of India for the expenses of certain quarantine officers lent to the Persian Govern ment in 1925, of the Persian Railway Syndicate, of the Persian Transport Company and of Mr. Richards for the non-exploitation of his forests in Mazanderan, were brought to the notice of the Persian Government. 305. At the end of the year the dossiers of all outstanding claims were being sorted and listed in order to be sent to the Foreign Office for expert examination. It was suspected that many of the claims would prove invalid in international law. Persian Railway Syndicate. 306. The Persian Government declared in the course of correspondence that they did not recognise this claim because the options from which it arose had never been ratified by the Majlis. This argument had been used orally in the past, but never before put forward officially. It is quite untenable, as no Majlis was in existence at any of the material dates. A vigorous representation in this sense was under consideration at the end of the year. Richards Forest Claim. 307. This enormous claim, which has for years been one of the banes of life at His Majesty’s Legation, was re-examined by the Foreign Office in the light of fresh evidence and found to be devoid of any legal basis. Mr. Richards was accordingly informed that it could no longer be supported. Commutation of Pensions. 308. A Bill that may give rise to “ claims ” in the future was passed in May; it provided for the compulsory surrender of all pensions in return for a lump sum payment of four times the annual value of the pension, and gave until March 1935 for applications to be made. The annual payments apparently stopped with effect from the passage of the Bill, but the Persian Government took no steps to inform British pensioners that this was so until the autumn, when the latter, puzzled at the non-payment of the usual instalments, began to make enquiries through His Majesty’s Legation. The only British subjects known to be affected were the Hon. L. H. Lindley and Lady Houtum-Schindler. [8706] e 354 Persian Transport Company. 309. In order to register under the Company Registration Law, the company were required to mention in their application any Government concession that they owned, and to produce a certificate of validity from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The Minister for Foreign Affairs was accordingly invited to grant a certificate of validity for the company’s concession for the Tehran-Ahwaz and Burujird-Isfahan Roads, but, not unnaturally, declined^o^ do so. His Majesty’s Minister thereupon placed it upon formal record that,^5 view of this refusal, the company would register without mentioning the concession, but that this would not preclude either them or His Majesty’s Legation from upholding the validity of the concession and the claim at the proper time. &lt;I) Debt. 310. Shortly after his return from Europe, the Minister of Court informed His Majesty’s Minister that the Persian Government intended in about two months’ time to repay the pre-war debt of £490,000 out of a payment of £1 million which they were to receive from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in respect of outstanding liabilities. 311. This was in February, and nothing further transpired till June, when the Persian Minister in London enquired whether His Majesty’s Government would agree to his Government drawing on deposits in Germany to the extent of £200,000 in part payment of the pre-war debt. He was informed that blocked deposits could not be accepted, and any repayment should be effected in sterling in London. 312. In December the commercial secretary tackled the Minister of Finance, who promised to look into the matter. 313. The fact that' the £1 million was never received (though due to the failure of the Persian Government themselves to carry through the agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company under which it was to be paid) was doubtless responsible for the non-payment of this debt. 314. In the conduct of the general treaty negotiations it was more or less taken for granted, but never admitted to the Persians, that the war and post-war debt would never be paid, but the remission of the remaining £510,000 of this debt was never actually offered. In March His Majesty’s Minister told the Ministers of Court and Foreign Affairs that the recent voting of £1,500,000 for armaments would inevitably make people abroad say that, if Persia could afford such luxuries, she could afford to pay her debts. They answered, optimistically perhaps, that, if His Majesty’s Government could not be induced to cancel the war and post-war debts, Persia would still have plenty of money in her reserves to pay these debts. V.—Internal Affairs (Political). (A) Court and Officials. Reza Shah Pahlavi. 315. The Shah has travelled in various parts of his country throughout the year. On the 3rd May he went to Mazanderan in order to inspect the vast properties which he owns in Tunekabun and the neighbourhood, as well as to look into the affairs of his spinning factory at Aliabad Shahi. He returned to the capital on the 18th May. He again visited Gilan and Mazanderan in September, leaving Tehran on the 24th of that month and returning soon after. 316. But his longest journey was commenced on the 24th October. He stayed a night at Qum, then proceeding to Isfahan, where he stayed a couple of days. He arrived at Shiraz on the 28th and made a thorough inspection of various forms of activity in the town. He then proceeded to Bushire on the 1st November and inspected the newly-arrived Persian navy. He arrived back in Tehran on the 15th November, having visited Ahwaz en route and inspected the southern section of the railway.55 317. His Majesty then left the capital for the Turkoman races on the 1st December, returning twelve days later. 318. His Majesty, who must be 60 years of age, is said to be suffering from some internal disorder. In outward appearance he has become more corpulent. He did little on his tours except criticise. At Ahwaz he openly insulted and abused the Director of Finance, owing to complaints which had reached tOe ‘ ^oyal ears made by tribal chiefs to the General Officer Commanding concerning the distribution of grain by revenue officials. He upbraided the people of fehiraz for not showing sufficient public spirit to establish native factories m their ci y. He chided the^ officer commanding the troops at Shiraz for having clothed his men with new uniforms. His subjects appear to take the philosophic view that the Royal displeasure is probably richly deserved, or, if it is not, the Shah, being an absolute ruler, is entitled to say and do what he likes. 319. His Majesty’s acquisitive habits have become even more pronounced. A number of landowners in Mazanderan have been forcibly dispossessed of then property, many under circumstances of great hardship. 320 The sudden and arbitrary dismissal of Mirza Abdul Hussein Diba from the post of Court Treasurer, and the equally arbitrary dismissal of Teymourtache, are alluded to below. The Crown Prince. 321 The Crown Prince left Lausanne in the summer, and in September was receiving instruction at an institution near Rolle, in Switzerland, named “ Institut le Rosey,” a very select school principally patronised, on account ot its enormous prices, by Americans. The Shah’s Elder Daughter. 322 It was at one time arranged that the Shah’s elder daughter, Shahdukht Shams-ul-Muhik aged 141, should be taken to Europe by Mme. Teymourtache, in order tobeeducated at a European, preferably an English, school. But the plan was not carried out. Minister of Court. 323 The great event of the year in internal politics was the fall ot Teymourtache. 'immediately after his return from Europe m February various rumours were current to the effect that he had incurred the displeasure of the Shah bv his extravagance in London and Paris, which had depleted to a s® 1 ' 10 ^ 3 extent the funds of the Pahlavi Bank. Similar rumours were revived in March, when numerous arrests took place among the minor employees of various Ministries the supposition being that his private ‘ intelligence system was being routed out. But nothing came of these rumours, and until the early summer his position appeared to be stronger than ever. 094 it is probable, though there is no conclusive evidence that the beginning of the end came with the announcement of the diminished Anglo- Persian Oil Company royalty in June. It is, at any rate certain that the agreement which he had concluded with the company, and which seems to have been accepted in principle until then, was definitely rejected as a result, furthe - more thecontrol of Anglo-Persian Oil Company affairs was taken from his hands soon afterwards and given to his rival, Taqizadeh, the Minister of Finance, the feud between the two being thenceforward one of the “hould in the capital At the same time orders were issued that the Ministries snouia In future conduct their own affairs without referring to the Ministry of Court at every point. 325 These difficulties, effectively aided by a predilection for night life, led to what mav have been atiuite genuine breakdown in the summer. There is at to what may nave Dee 4 &amp; Teymourtache then paid to thJ Ca^an'cioast^as^neces'sitate^by an a'larmingly hig'h blood pressure, and on SJfhestm seemed able, m spite of all f-;—iskaf i^ ^ ' of intervening effectively in most branches of the Administration. [8706] E 456 326. The rumours by this time had crystallised upon the affairs of the National Bank, in which Teymourtache had always taken an active interest and which were clearly in a bad way. An official investigation that took place in the autumn was supposed to have whitewashed everyone concerned, but, in spite of this, there is every ground for supposing that, apart from anything else, he had made money on a rather shady exchange transaction connected with an Anglo- Persian Oil Company loan to the Bakhtiari Khans. ^ 327. The crisis began shortly after the return of the Shah from the south m November. Teymourtache was constantly reported to have resigned, to have been imprisoned, to have been executed, to have been given a post abroad, and so on. His position seemed more assured after an official salaam on the 16th December, at which the Shah treated him with particular cordiality, but on the 24th December it became known that his dismissal, which had been whispered for some days, was an accomplished fact. At the end of the year he was still at liberty, though under close surveillance. 328. Teymourtache’s own downfall was preceded by that of his faithful henchman, Mirza Abdul Hussein Khan Diba, the Treasurer of the Court. The latter, a somewhat odious and certainly corrupt character, is known to have been in disfavour with the Shah for some time, but to have maintained his position through the good offices of his chief. The story goes that one evening Diba won a large sum at cards from Mujallal-ed-Dowleh Doulatshahi, the father of the Shah’s second (Qajar) wife, so large that the loser had a heart attack when leaving the table and succumbed soon afterwards. A day or two later Diba was, on the 17th November, dismissed, and later placed under open arrest at his house. His downfall was regarded at the time as a blow at Teymourtache’s prestige, and the fact that Teymourtache went openly to the cinema with Diba and his wife the evening after the latter’s dismissal may have been regarded by the Shah as an act of defiance. 329. The real reason for Teymourtache’s fall may have been a growing determination to show that no Minister was indispensable, and the affairs of the National Bank and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company mere excuses. Popular belief inclined, at first at any rate, to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, to whom he was supposed to have shown himself unduly friendly. The Cabinet. 330. The aged Mehdi Quli Hedayat continued Prime Minister in name throughout the year, though he had very little to do with the direction of affairs of State. On the 27th February Seyyid Baqir Khan Kazimi resigned from his post as Minister of Roads and Communications, and was succeeded by Mirza Riza Khan Afshar, who was in turn succeeded by General Abdul-Majid Mirza Firuz (Nasir-ed-Dowleh) on the 14th July. In October it was announced that Mirza Yahya Khan Qaragozlu was appointed Persian Minister at Paris, and that his post as Minister of Education would be taken over by Mirza Riza Quli Khan Hidayat (Nayyir-ul-Mulk). But the change did not take place at once, and Mirza Yahya Khan was still Minister of Education at the end of the year. Mirza Ali Akbar Khan Hakimi was relieved of his duties as Director-General of Agriculture in June; his duties were taken over by Seyyid Mehdi Khan Farrukh, in addition to Farrukh’s duties as Director-General of Industry (which includes mines). Mirza Qasim Khan Sur-i-Israfil resigned on the 26th March and was succeeded as Minister of Posts and Telegraphs by Mirza Farajullah Khan Bahrami (Dabir-i-A’zam) on that date.

The following changes took place in the sections of the Ministry :— Director of the Section of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics : Mirza Hamid Khan Sayyah. Department of Economics : Mirza Abdul LIussein Khan Ansari. Treaty Department: Mirza Musa Khan Nuri Isfandiari. Nationality and Passport Section : Mirza Fathullah Khan Nuri Isfandiari. (B) The Majlis. The Elections. 334. A Royal decree was promulgated on the 15th August, 1932, announcing that elections for the ninth session of the Majlis were authorised to begin the following day. Necessary steps have since been taken in various electoral areas for the election of Deputies. A certain number of electoral areas had not arranged their elections by the end of the year. It is, however, hoped that a sufficient number of Deputies will have been elected by the date of expiry of the58 present Majlis term (the 15th January, 1933) to enable, for the first time, the provisions of the Electoral Law to be fulfilled, m the sense that there should be no interregnum between successive sessions of the Majlis. 335. There is no doubt that candidates are selected by the Government in every case, and local Governors are instructed to see that the proper persons are elected. This is so generally known that few people bother to vote, but the Committee of Scrutineers finds no difficulty in returning reasonable numbers (^j| voters, with the proper names at the top of the poll. 336. At Tabriz a significant incident took place. On the night after the usual election notices were posted in the town; a manifesto m leisian, pun e by gelatine process and purporting to come from the National Organisation Azerbaijan,” was freely circulated and posted on doors and windows. It called on “ fellow countrymen ” to remember the oppression and tyranny of the police, which was suppressing the nation’s aspirations; and it summoned all and sundry to boycott the elections as a protest. The manifesto concluded with an appeal to the oppressed proletariat, framed in the usual phraseology of Bolshevik propaganda. All copies were speedily impounded by the police, who have doubtless been trying their hardest to discover the authors of the manifesto It was undoubtedly a symptom of local discontent as well as an example of the well-known methods of Soviet propaganda.

It will be seen from the foregoing list, which only contains the principal measures, that the Majlis has been exceedingly busy during the year, fortunately, an official Majlis Review is now published in Persian giving the texts of all enactments. Wide powers are also given to the Minister of Justice to promulgate regulations approved by the judicial commission of the Majlis. It is becoming increasingly difficult for Persian lawyers to keep pace with this constantly changing stream of legislation. ^ The Taraqqi Party. 339. \\ ith the temporary eclipse of its founder Teymourtache in August, followed by his fall on the 22nd December, the Taraqqi party has to all intents and purposes disappeared. His Majesty, in a speech to certain Deputies, who had come to one of his receptions on the 17th October, alluded to the desirability of forming a national party for the furtherance of national aims in Persia, somewhat on the lines of the Fascist party. The idea may be to replace the defunct laraqqi party by something more universal; or it may foreshadow a genuine attempt to instil into the population at large some of the ideas of duty and responsibility which are being painfully instilled into the official and military classes. Nothing more was heard of the new party by the end of the year. In a Majlis the members of which are all chosen beforehand by the Government it does not appear likely that any party will arise in opposition to the Shah’s expressed desires. Public Feeling. 340. There can be no doubt that during the year dissatisfaction with the present regime, if it did not actually become more intense, became much more apparent, and that a general feeling of malaise persisted throughout. Amonc 1, the people at large this was mainly caused by economic conditions, reflected in the increasingly high cost of living; among the merchants by the senseless restric tions on trade; among the landowning class (and a few peasants too) by the Shah’s increasing land-hunger, manifested in the main bv the expropriation of estates with scarcely a pretext of legality; and among the officers of the army by the suspicion which drove the Shah to supersede any man of ability by inexperienced nonentities. r o41 Reports of plots first became current at the time of the arrest of various Government employees in March. Though the “convictions” which tollowed were for aiding a foreign Power, rather than promoting internal disturbances, further arrests gave rise to further rumours. Among others some leading mullahs were exiled from Tehran for having preached against the marriage laws and other modernising tendencies in the Administration, while retainers of both the Qawam-ul-Mulk and Soulet-ed-Dowleh were imprisoned. Later in the summer Soulet-ed-Dowleh and his son were imprisoned on charges of having incited their Qashgai follows to revolt. Shaukat-ul-Mulk was brought to Tehran during the summer as a guest of the Shah, but was allowed to return to Eirjand later. 342. There were also signs, slight it is true, of an increasing mistrust of minorities to whom the Pahlavi regime has hitherto shown itself well disposed An order forbidding Bahai meetings was issued in June, though it does not seem to have been enforced, while suspicion of the Assyrians was exemplified by the arrest of several of their number who had conversed with a British officer or the Iraq Levies who had visited the Rezaiyeh district. 343. Other signs of the Shah’s uneasiness were the tightening up of the control of persons moving about the country. These were designed principally against Soviet agents (see paragraph 22), but they incidentally caused great inconvenience on occasion to members of the Diplomatic Corps. 344. More than one leading Persian outside the Government expressed the t0 HlS M , ajest ^ s Minister that conditions were such that, though nothin^ might happen so long as the Shah kept his nerve, any noticeable set-back in foreign or domestic policy might cause the downfall of a regime which everyone had come to hate.01 (C) Tribes and Security. Azerbaijan and Kurdistan. 345. Kurdish rebels from the Karalar zone, near Ararat, entered Persian territory in the middle of March and were engaged by regular troops. Fresh trouble of a similar nature was again reported from frontier villages in July -^nd August. Fars. 346. Brigandage on the Shiraz-Bushire route was sporadic during the year; but the Qashgai tribe, with most of their leaders safely at Tehran, gave little trouble. It is significant that, when the Shah visited Shiraz in October, he refrained from carrying out his intention to visit the new town, named Tul-i- Khosrow, which is being built in the Mamassani country near Ardakan; the probable reason being that robbers had attacked and robbed a caravan on the road two days before His Majesty proposed to travel. Mohammad Jan Surkhi, brother of the outlaw Mehdi Surkhi, who was hung in Shiraz in 1931, was at large throughout the year, 'and in October raided two villages in the vicinity of Firuzabad. Ali Khan, half-brother of Ismail Khan Qashgai (Soulet-ed- Dowleh), was also in opposition to the Government towards the end of the year. He had gathered a few Qashgai tribesmen round him and established himself in the mountains south of Shiraz. A force of some 500 men was sent from Shiraz to deal with him. Baluchistan and the Sarhadd. 347. Spasmodic operations against Abdul Hussein of Ramishk went on throughout the year. Two thousand troops under Sarhang Muhammad Ali Khan Nakhjewan were employed against him, the troops being taken from Khwash, Bam and Bandar Abbas. At the end of March the defeat of Abdul Hussein was announced, and the troops returned to Khwash and Kerman by the 18th May. Sardar Saidi and the Nawab of Ab-i-Khurran, however, had certainly not surrendered, and by July it was clear that Abdul Hussein was still to be reckoned with; he was then raiding freely from the hills in Bashakird. Barakat Khan of Bint was, however, arrested and sent to Tehran. Autumn operations made the pace too hot for some of the Yarmuhammadzai Damani, headed by Sardar Jiand Khan, and they fled over the border to British territory. From there they petitioned the Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan, requesting that repre sentations should be made on their behalf in Tehran; the Government of India replied that they saw no reason why representations should be made in a matter which is the domestic concern of the Persian Government. 348. Intercession was, however, made for the unfortunate remnant of Dost Muhammad’s followers (Ali Muhammad Baranzai and Nushirawan Baranzai being the principal ones), who were proving a source of great embarrassment to the Indian Government, as they were entirely destitute. 349. The Ministry of the Interior, by appointing a civil governor to Baluchistan (Mirza Hussein Khan Badi’) in October, showed that the civil side of the Persian Administration was trying to regain from the military some of the control which the latter has exercised over Baluchistan for so long. Luristan. 350. The state of disorder of this troublous province went from bad to worse during the year. The Government’s policy of forcible transplantation of the Lurs to other parts of Persia has met with little success. The Khorremabad Road, though in good condition and carrying a considerable amount of traffic, has been the scene of numerous robberies. In May a band of fifty robbers were holding up cars between Khorremabad and Burujird; and, though fourteen chiefs and eighteen of their followers were publicly hanged at Khorremabad in July, the brigands were not intimidated. In fact, Yadullah Khan Bairanwand kidnapped the Governor of Luristan and the chief of police at Khorremabad at the beginning of August; and only surrendered them on receipt of a ransom. But the rnos? successful raid was effected on the 3rd September, when a large convoy of cars and lorries were held up and looted on the main road betweenKermanshah and Hamadan, at a place near Sahneh, named the Tang-i-Lulak. Among the prisoners were the American consul and vice-consul; they were eventually recaptured, more or less by accident, and reached Tehran unhurt, except for very sore feet. The dissident band were said to be organised by a certain ex-officer in the Persian army named Colonel Gigu. In December a large number of troops were sent to round up the rebels, and operations were placed in charge of Sepahbud Ahmed Agha Khan. | Khuzistan. 351. An Arab outlaw of the Beni Turuf, named Yerow, was at large in May and was causing trouble on the road between Mianab and Dizful. The lawlessness in the outlying districts of Khuzistan increased during June and July. Bushire and the Gulf Ports. 352. Disarmament among the Dashtis and Tangistanis continued as far as circumstances permitted. Sheikh Muhammad-bin-Ahmad Khalfan was reported to have been defeated by the Persian troops in the Shibkuh area in June and his fort at Teben occupied. He himself, however, appears to have escaped, and was still a source of trouble at the end of the year. 353. To sum up : the new Persian army has been engaged pretty strenuously throughout the year in suppressing robbery and banditry. The policy of the Central Government has been to concentrate, as far as possible, all the principal tribal leaders in Tehran. The Persian Government, in this respect, has undoubtedly acted with wisdom, and it is difficult to say how they would otherwise have been able to deal with their unruly subjects, impoverished as they are by high taxation, soaring prices and increased cost of living. A blow was struck at the Qashgai tribe when the well-known Qashgai chief, Ismail Khan Qashgai (Soulet-ed-Dowleh), and his son Nasir Khan were summarily put into prison at Tehran without trial at the beginning of September. The fact that, as members of the Majlis, they were immune from civil process was soon got over by the passing of a special act authorising the arrest. (D) The Qajar Family. 354. The executor named in the will of the late Shah, Sultan Ahmad Qajar, was the Guarantee Trust Company of New York. The London representatives of the company applied in January to the Foreign Office for permission to include in the Legation bag a sealed tin box, said to contain documents of the late Shah, held by the Imperial Bank of Persia, Tehran. The Persian Government’s consent had been obtained. The Secretary of State replied that he was unable to accede to the request, and nothing more has been heard of the matter. 355. Prince Abu’l Path Mirza, Salar-ed-Dowleh, continued to reside in Palestine. His pension, at the rate of 18,000 rupees per annum, is still being paid by the Persian Government in six-monthly instalments, usually in arrear. The Persian Government correspond officially with the Legation on the subject, and no doubt regard His Majesty’s Government as responsible for keeping the mad prince out of Persia. (E) The Sheikh of Mohammerah. 356. The sheikh remains in Tehran, a virtual prisoner. Periodic attacks of a recurrent form of diabetes (glycosuria) increase the bitterness which the failure of the Persian Government to display any serious interest in the settle ment of his affairs must cause. He has quarrelled with his principal wife and with the son in whom he trusted. The Persian Government on their part are suspicious of his every action. An Armenian doctor named Caro Minassian, who used to look after his numerous ailments, went to London at the end of 1931 to take a course of study at one of the London hospitals. The Persian Government, suspecting in some hazy way that Minassian might cause trouble between His Majesty’s Government and themselves, had the doctor carefully watched by detectives in London.63 357. The commission appointed to assess the value of the s.ieikh s lands m Khuzistan under the agreement of December 1930, left Tehran early in the year and arrived at Ahwaz on the 18th February. Their investigations continued un i the hot weather became unendurable; they then returned to Tehran and rendered a report, on which no decisive action has been taken. To judge from the following incident it appears unlikely that the sheikh will receive a fair value for his Properties: a certain building at Ahwaz was valued by the commission at 15,000 tomans; and as it was in the occupation of a branch of the finance Department, a recommendation was made that the purchase-money should, be handed over to the sheikh. The latter, although he did not agree t° the pi ice and was not bound (under the terms of the agreement) to sell, saw that all the members of the commission (including the Persian Government’s own representative) were agreed on the price and made no objection. But no offer was made by the Finance Department for some time; and, finally, a letter arrived suggesting that the sheikh should sell for 5,000. The sheikh on his part appears to have done what he could to facilitate the work of the commission; in April 1932 he sent his son, Abdul Kerim, to Basra to extract the originals of certain firmans for the com mission’s information. The sheikh is incensed to observe that the affairs of Mirza Ibrahim Khan Qawam, who was treated in a similar way (i.e. his lands in Fars were valued and an equivalent amount of land was given to him m other parts of Persia), have been settled within the year, although the affairs of the Qawam have been under discussion for a relatively short time. 358 Meanwhile, the sheikh exists on sums remitted to him by his trusted agent at Basra, Mirza Muhammad, Khan Bahadur. It is not clear whether the sheikh is fully aware of the difference which the newly-proposed istihlak tax on the produce will make to his Iraq revenues. No protest in the matter appears to have yet been made by him. VI.— Internal Affairs (Economic). (A) Finance. Revenue and Expenditure (1931-32). 359 It has been found possible in the past to publish in each annual report, under the above heading, a table supplied by the Ministry of Finance, to which one dubiously pinned one’s faith faute de mieux. The Ministry this year, in spite ot repeated entreaties to revert to ancient practice, broke new ground by furnishing the Legation with the copy of an astonishing document which had been transmitted to the Persian Legation in London, and which was intended to serve as a reply to a questionnaire submitted by the London Stock Exchange Intelligence in respect of the Persian financial year ending the 21st March, 19&lt;L5. This masterpiece unfortunately quotes the revenue and expenditure returns toi 1930-31 instead of 1931-32. Budget 1932-33. 360. This budget was passed by the Majlis on the 13th March. Revenue was estimated at 421,400,000 krans plus £787,000, and expenditure at 421 399,870 krans plus 407,176 pahlavis. The pahlavi is regarded as the equivalent of the gold pound, while sterling during 1932 was officially reckoned for Persian customs purposes as being at a discount of 30 per cenL m tei ^ s o gold. 407,176 pahlavis on this basis of calculation equal £529,329, so tnat a surplus of £257,000 seems to have been budgeted for. 361 It will be remembered that this is no consolidated budget. TJ 16 royalties continue to be credited to the Government’s reserves abroad and do not enter into the budget; likewise the receipts from the bugar and Tea Monopoly, which are paid into the railway fund, and that part of the Road Tax which actually accrues to the road fund. 362 Revenue shows an increase of close on 100 million krans less £75,000 over the previous year’s budget. The most interesting section is that entitled “ Receipts from Monopolies,” which includes two new items : commercial receipts from transactions in sugar 74,713,530 krans and the same for matches 2 540 040 krans—the result of the monopoly of the supply of sugar and matches accorded to the Soviets under the commercial treaty of October 1331, winch04 commodities the Persian Government took it upon themselves to receive from the Soviets and sell to the merchants. On the expenditure side 30 million krans are allowed “for the operation of the Sugar and Match Monopoly,” and 1^ million krans “in connexion with the collection of revenues on sugar and matches,” so that it is clear that the Government hope to clear a profit of 45 million rials from this source during the first year. Though part of this profit will be made at the expense of the merchants who formerly distributed the suga» and matches imported into the country, the bulk of it will probably come from th? pockets of the consumers, whose standard of living for the most part is already wretchedly low. 363. (It should be noted, to avoid confusion, that what is still referred to as the Sugar and Tea Monopoly is no monopoly, but a subterfuge resorted to in 1925 to collect 2 krans on each man of imported sugar and 6 krans on each man of imported tea, to which is now added a gold surcharge, with which to create and maintain a railway fund. The new Sugar and Match Monopoly, on the other hand, is a monopoly in fact as well as in name in so far that the Government is the sole importer.) 364. Receipts from the new sugar refinery at Kerej are put at 4 million krans, but the cost of operation during the first year, which may conceivably cover depreciation, is assessed at 5 million krans. Nothing is said of the capital invested in the old sugar factory at Karizak, which was renovated during the year, perhaps because this is regarded as a private venture on the part of the National Bank. 365. The above items—together with the receipts from the Caspian fisheries (4-5 million krans) which figure in the budget for the first time, together with more than tripled receipts on account of customs storage, due no doubt to the quantities of goods held up owing to the trade monopoly restrictions and the financial difficulty of clearing goods through the customs—^account for almost the total increase in revenue. 366. As regards expenditure, the budget foresees an increase of close on 100 million krans less 451,487 pahlavis. Of this the Ministry of War takes 20 million krans and 3^ millions more for the road guards than were allocated to the Ministry of Finance the year before for the same purpose. The Ministry of Finance takes an additional 12 million krans, which is apparently intended to cover the maintenance of the preventive navy as this year nothing is allowed the Ministry of War under this head. The appropriation of 30 million krans for the operation of the Sugar and Match Monopoly has already been referred to. Financial Situation on December 20, 1932. 367. No statement of the financial situation of the Persian Government was published during 1932, neither was the Legation able to obtain the usual table showing the Treasury-General balances in Tehran and Europe on the one side, and the public debt and floating debt on the other. One should, however, be able to arrive at a pretty accurate idea of the position by collating all available data and working on the basis of the table showing the position on the 21st March, 1931, as given in paragraph 312 of the 1931 annual report. That table gave the figure of the total Treasury balances as £5-56 million, of which £2 -47 (222-5 million krans converted at 90) in Tehran, while the balance was actually held in sterling in Europe. 368. The kran balances, other than the railway fund, are not thought to have changed to any appreciable extent. They are too small to be worth worrying about in any case. 369. The railway fund itself then amounted to 18 million tomans, and the receipts during the intervening period are believed to have totalled 17 million tomans, the two items together representing 35 million tomans. The unappro priated balance in the railway fund in December 1932, according to information supplied privately by competent Government officials, amounted to 7| million tomans, so that expenditure in the intervening period must have amounted to 27-| million tomans. 370. The kran balances taken as a whole—the term “kran” is used throughout, instead of its modern equivalent, the “rial,” to avoid confusion--65 t. /. should, on the above basis of calculation, have been reduced by 27^ million tomans or 275 million krans, but part of this deficit has been made good by the Persian Government’s profits on its purchases of gold. 371. The last of the statements published by the National Bank of the notes issued by it, and the cover held against the note issue, revealed the interesting fact that the Government on the 22nd December possessed 1,235,238-67 miscals ! gold (-975 fine) which, at 20-675 dollars to the troy ounce, works out at 3-7 million dollars approximately, or some 113 million krans. The Treasurer- General, however, is known to have stated in the strictest confidence that this stock of gold only cost 80 million krans. As the export of gold is prohibited, and smuggling has been rendered difficult, its price on the local market is frequently 10-15 per cent, below the world rate, while silver has also depreciated of late, and it was with silver krans from the trust funds that these purchases of gold were effected during the last two years. It is not often that the Persian Government have made a good investment, and they are to be congratulated on this one. 372. The kran balances on the 20th December, 1932, can now be assessed at 222-5 millions (held in March 1931), minus 105 millions (spent on the railway), plus 30 millions (representing the Government’s profits, actually unrealised, on their gold purchases) = 147-5 million krans, or £1-46 million at 101. 373. Now the sterling balance held in March 1931 has to be subjected to the following manipulations :— £ Balance in hand March 21, 1931 ... ... ... 3 088 401 Credits— (i) 1930 Royalty paid after March 20, 1931 ... 1,228,000 (ii) 1931 Royalty refused by Persian Government, but, nevertheless, credited to their account in 1932 ... ... ... ... 307,000 Total Debits— (i) Balance of 1929-30 armament £ appropriation ... 348,000 (ii) 1931 and 1932 appropriations for purchase of gunboats 780,000 ? (iii) Latest armament vote in 1932-33 budget 1,500,000 4,623,401 2,628,000 Unappropriated balance ... 1,995,401 Say ... ... 2,000,000 Note.—T here is some doubt regarding the exact figure of the naval appro priations, three in all. 374. The total balances on the 20th December, 1932, if these calculations are correct, amounted to £1 • 46 plus £2 million = £3 • 46 as compared with £5 • 5 million in March 1931, a fall of just over 37 per cent. 375. Unfortunately for the Persian Government their “ gold reserves,” at the time His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom decided to go off gold (in September 1931), were actually in sterling, and the dollar equivalents of P the sterling amounts just quoted, viz., 11,504,500 dollars and 26,620,000 dollars, show a fall of 56-8 per cent. 376. If one assumes the funded and floating debts of the Persian Govern ment to have remained at the same figure since March 1931, which seems permissible, their financial situation on the 20th December, 1932, works out as follows :— £ Funded Debt .. .. .. 1,600,000 Floating- Debt 6 • 6 million krans at 101 66,000 Credit balance .. .. .. 1,794,000 f Kran balances 147*5 million rials at 101 .. .. .. .. 1,460,000 Sterling- balances.. .. .. 2,000,000 [8706] 3,460,000 3,460,000 F66 377. This credit balance of £1,794,000, or 5,965,050 dollars (at 3 325), compares very unfavourably, of course, with that of March 1931, amounting to £3,885,000, or 18,803,000 dollars (at 4-84), the reduction in the dollar credit being particularly striking, amounting to over 67 per cent. 378. The fact remains, nevertheless, that the Persian Government can consider themselves fortunate in having maintained so liquid a position in of adverse circumstances. There is very little excuse, however, for t^^ extraordinary expenditure incurred or about to be incurred on armaments, the total amount earmarked for this purpose since March 1929 being £2| million, apart from the naval appropriations. Railway Finance. 379. The Tehran newspaper Kushish stated, on the 16th August, 1931, that the Sugar and Tea Monopoly Tax, from its inception in May 1928 to the 22nd March, 1931, had brought in 40-276 million tomans, whilst the expenditure incurred on the railway during that period amounted to 21-925 millions, leaving a surplus of 18-35 millions. This computation appears to be confirmed by the table referred to in the foregoing section, showing the balances held by the Treasury on the 22nd March, 1931, including 18 million tomans in the railway fund. 380. Receipts during the period March 1931 to December 1932 (twenty-one months) appear to have totalled 17 million tomans, averaging 19-5 million tomans for the two years ending the 22nd March, 1933. On the other hand, the unappropriated balance in the railway fund in December 1932 amounted to 7-5 millions. If we add 2| millions for the next quarter’s revenue (the expenditure incurred during that quarter being met out of the amounts already appropriated), the railway fund at the beginning of the next Persian year should show a credit balance of 10 million tomans, or, roughly, £1 million. 381. The position on the 22nd March next can therefore be tabulated as follows :— (In millions of tomans.) Total revenue— Credit balance ... 10,000 40-276 + 19-5 ... 59-776 Expenditure ... 49-776 59 776 59-776 382. This allows for an expenditure during the two years ending the 22nd March next of 49-776 million tomans, less the 21-925 million tomans spent up to March 1931, or 27-85 million tomans—the rate of exchange having gone heavily against Persia—as compared with revenue estimated at 19-5 million tomans only. 383. Where future construction is concerned, the only up-to-date figures in the possession of the Legation refer to the south. When the Shah told the American engineer in charge to estimate the cost and the time it would take to bring the line through the formidable Luristan range, he was furnished with the following figures :— Salehabad-Bahrein (a little south of Khorremabad) : 212 kilom. Cost: 43 million tomans to be expended locally -f 6 million dollars to be spent on foreign material = at present rates of exchange roughly 60 million tomans, or £6 million. Tunnelling alone would account for 23 million tomans at 1 million tomans the kilometre. Time: Three years. 384. The most that can be expected from the sugar and tea monopoly at the present rate of taxation (which includes a gold surcharge of 160 per cent.) is 10 million tomans a year, so that the most the Persian Government would have to spend during these three years—if they are limited to their present source of revenue for railway purposes—is 30 million tomans, plus the 10 millions already in the railway fund in March 1933, or 40 millions in all, equalling £4 million.67 385. The Shah, however, is said on good authority to insist at the moment on the completion of the above 212 kilom. in two years instead of three, which would probably add not less than £1 million to the cost of construction, while revenue would also decrease by another million pounds. 386. Even if the Persian Government were to abandon construction in the jj^rth, therefore, they would, on the basis of the above estimates, be faced with a wficit of £2 million if they built 212 kilom. in the south in three years, and of £4 million if this distance were completed in two years. 387. Where the north is concerned, the Legation is only aware of a five-year plan, elaborated by Swedish engineers in January 1932, to extend the line to Tehran at a cost of 25-30 million tomans, the latter figure then representing £5 million. There is no reason to think that the Shah is likely to be less impatient regarding progress in the north than in the south, and here again a still larger expenditure must be incurred if the rate of construction is to be hastened. 388. Assuming that the Shah wishes the two sections to be extended pari passu in a minimum of time—say, three years—we must allow for an expenditure of £12 million at the very least, whereas the total amount available during those three years, as has already been seen, can hardly amount to more than £4 million. 389. The additional revenue that can be collected locally for railway purposes, in the present state of commercial stagnancy, cannot affect the financial aspect of the railway issue to any appreciable extent. Even the appropriation for the railway of what is left in the oil royalty account, estimated at £2 million, plus the revenue to accrue under this head during the next three years, cannot fill the gap of £8 million. 390. It looks, to sum up, as if two courses were open to the Shah (i) To consent to a six-eight-year programme, in which case the Sugar and Tea Monopoly Tax, plus the oil royalties, would possibly provide sufficient revenue to cover the cost of construction from Salehabad northwards to Khorremabad, or even farther, and from Aliabad southwards to Tehran; or (ii) Raise a loan, presumably secured on the oil royalty—in which case much will depend on the upshot of the negotiations for the revision of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s concession—if the Shah’s determina tion to finish the railway, and finish it quickly, can overcome his rooted objection to a foreign loan policy. Financial Advisers. 391. The Belgian experts at the Ministry of Finance and the Treasury enumerated in paragraph 313 of the 1931 report seem to have worked quietly and efficiently, although the Minister of Court continued to disregard their advice on the rare occasions he asked for it, preferring to go his own way. Currency. 392. In early February Teymourtache charged the Currency Commission with the task of reconsidering the question of Persia’s future currency. His mind appears to have been already made up, however, as he informed the commission before it had really embarked on its labours that he or an economist whom he had consulted during his recent journey to Europe—had evolved the following plan : The pahlavi would nominally be worth 100 rials, instead of the 20 rials laid down in the Gold Standard Law, and the rial would take the place of the kran. It seemed natural to suppose that the pahlavi under these conditions would be no more than a unit of measure—a few gold pahlavis being minted for private purposes only—and that the currency would remain on a silver basis, the task merely being one of substituting rials for krans. Arrangements were also made with the American Bank-note Company to accelerate the completion of the order it had received for the new notes, which it was hoped to put into circulation by the new year (the 21st March, 1932). [8706] F 268 393. The main elements of this plan were incorporated in a law amending the Gold Standard Law (of the 18th March, 1930) which was passed by the Majlis with double urgency on the 13th March. The Persian official mind, however, was not able to bring itself to recognise that the gold standard, which it so idealised and which in the Persian imagination conferred on the Persian Government unilaterally the right to collect customs dues on a gold basis, was altogether a thing of the past. This law, therefore, was used to keep alive t^j fiction that the gold standard still existed. Gold coins were not only to be struck^ but to be put into circulation, while a suggestion in one article (article 2) that the Persian Government were introducing bi-metalism was shattered in another which stipulated that the National Bank, “ pending the return to a normal economic situation,” was under no obligation to pay out gold (article 10). 394. The total note issue is not to exceed 340 million rials (article 5), or 34 million tomans, as compared with roughly 13 million tomans in circulation at the time the law was passed, and 20 millions in periods of greater trade activity. The note issue is to be covered to the extent of 100 per cent., but the silver in circulation, which must amount to not less than 60 per cent, of the notes (article 6), is to be reckoned as cover. The National Bank is bound to give silver rials in exchange for notes presented to it in Tehran, but in the provinces it need only do so within the limits of each branch’s reserve—a clause which aroused a good deal of criticism. 395. Article 9 prescribes the creation of a Currency Board, but it is to be entirely composed of Persian Government officials, so that its announcements are hardly likely to inspire very much confidence. 396. Apart from various absurdities, and viewed from a strictly practical angle, this scheme appeared to offer an eminently sensible solution to the currency problem, and it was actually put into practice without the slightest dislocation of business. The new rial notes, issued by the National Bank, were put into circulation at the No-Ruz, at first in the smaller denominations only and later in the larger; they did not go to a discount, as had been generally prophesied. The withdrawal of the Imperial Bank notes was also effected without a hitch, the responsibility of the bank ceasing to all intents and purposes when it paid the Government the face value of all notes which had not been presented by the 13th September. 397. The Persian currency now consists of— (i) Notes (made in the United States) of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 500 rials. (n) Silver (minted locally) in coins of 5, 2, 1 and 1 rials. (iii) Nickel (minted in Germany) in coins of 25, 10 and 5 dinars. (iv) Copper (minted in Germany) in coins of 1 and 2 dinars. (There are 100 dinars to the rial.) Exchange. 398. The change in currency coincided roughly with the freeing of foreign exchange opeiations by a Bill passed on the 14th February. Control of exchange derived from exports, however, was retained by the Government. Such exchange can only be sold to the authorised banks at rates fixed bv the Government, and the banks can only resell it, at fixed rates, to bona fide importers on production of import licences. The immediate result of the lifting of the control was a rise in rates quoted by the banks from 63 krans to 78 krans to the £, thus coming into line with the de facto rate at which operations were being done in the bazaar. The pound again became the basis for all foreign exchange rates after a brief spell of calculations on the French franc. In consequence the gold surcharge on specific customs duties (fixed at 20 per cent, in April 1930, when the local currency depreciated from 50 krans, the rate obtaining at the time of signature of the Tariff Autonomy treaty, to 60 krans to the pound, and increased to 80 per cent, m February 1931 when the kran further depreciated officially to 90 to the pound) was further raised on the 15th February, 1932, to 120 per cent., as the gold pound69 was then worth 110 krans. This surcharge was automatically raised as the local currency depreciated, and at the end of the year it stood at 160 per cent, (after touching 176 per cent, on the 26th May) based on the gold pound worth 130 rials (or krans), the paper pound being quoted at about 100 rials. 400. The depreciation of the kran, or rial, was due in part to the falling oh ^the value of exports, the proceeds of which did not suffice for the purchase of declared imports, let alone the ever-increasing contraband trade which the Government were materially unable to check. Heavy purchases by the Soviet trading institutions during the summer helped to force the de facto rate as high as 118, from which figure, however, it quickly receded to about 110. 401. In order to curb this rising tendency in the bazaar and to attract business to the banks, the Council of Ministers on the 14th May passed a decree, the essential feature of which was that exchange not derived from exports, such as exchange obtained in any form on the Persian market, would not be accepted in fulfilment of exchange obligations on account of exports. As soon as this decree was published, the banks, in accordance with the wish of the Minister of Court, raised their rates to the level ruling in the bazaar, 104, but as they were not in a position to sell freely the bazaar rate went higher still, and was always a few points higher till the Foreign Trade Monopoly (Amendment) Act was passed on the 10th July. By article 7 (k) of this Act the Government was empowered to fix an official rate for the purchase and sale of exchange derived from exports, and this stable rate was fixed on the 28th July at 28 rials buying and 28-28 rials selling to the dollar, being based on the price of silver on the New York market. This rate was thereafter maintained, all other currencies fluctuating according to their relative New York quotations in Europe. 402. From that date, the 28th July, there have been two “legal” rates quoted by the banks : the official rate for exporters’ exchange, based on the fixed dollar rate (as above), and a rate for “ free ” exchange, based on the premium which buyers were prepared to pay the holders of import licences for exporters’ exchange. This premium was usually in the neighbourhood of 7 rials per £, or roughly 8 per cent. The rates at the end of the year for the two categories of exchange (which were naturally affected by the depreciation of the pound in terms of the dollar from October onwards) were : exporters’ 92-60 rials; free 99 rials to the pound. 403. Bazaar quotations since July were in the main based on the bank rates, and as the banks were able to purchase a fair proportion of the exchange offered and to sell more or less freely, the “ black bourse ” gradually disintegrated. 404. The following table gives approximately the average monthly sterling buying rates of the Imperial Bank of Persia during the year. Those obtaining until the 14th February being the arbitrary and largely inoperative rates fixed by the Government, and thereafter the officially recognised and publicly accepted rates for “ free exchange,” as explained above :— January February March April May June Rials. 62-25 July 67-90 August 88-75 September 94 40 October 98-80 November 104-00 December Rials. 105-30 108-55 102-50 99-60 98- 85 99- 10 giving an approximate rate for the year of 94-15 rials to the pound. Imperial Bank of Persia. 405. Nothing occurred during the year to mar the relations between the bank and the Persian Government. 406. The question of the withdrawal of the Imperial Bank’s notes is dealt with in the currency section. [8706] f 3* t * 70 National Bank. 407. This German-managed bank was shaken to its foundations by the scandals which were brought to light during 1932. 408. In February the Legation learnt that a commission had been appointed under the presidency of the Minister of Justice to examine the books of the bauL^ the attention of the Government having been called to certain undisclosed los^R 1 It could already then be said that the days of Dr. Lindenblatt’s regime were counted, the press campaign and political bias against the Germans having undoubtedly led various denunciators, who might otherwise have kept quiet, to voice their complaints against Dr. Lindenblatt and his methods. The latter about this time received instructions to hand over to the Department of Industries the two sugar factories which had been committed to his charge, and this was regarded as a severe blow to the bank’s prestige, particularly as it was ascribed to the Shah’s intervention. The Minister of Court, who had hitherto protected the German manager of the bank against criticism, was also reported in May to have attacked his former favourite in connection with his ineffective handling of the exchange market. 409. Dr. Lindenblatt left Tehran for Europe ostensibly on leave early in June, his departure having been delayed to allow for the preparation of a balance sheet at the insistent request, it was said, of the chairman of the board of control. It was generally believed, however, that Dr. Lindenblatt had been summarily dismissed, but that the Shah had exacted a guarantee from the German Minister that Dr. Lindenblatt would be available to furnish any explanations that might be called for regarding his conduct of the bank’s affairs. 410. Dr. Lindenblatt, who left his German assistant, Herr Vogel, in charge, paid farewell visits before his departure on the chief manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia and the resident director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, when he held language which was obviously intended to convey the impression that the hostility of His Majesty’s Government and the reluctance of these two British institutions, especially the bank, to co-operate with him had materially contributed to his failure. 411. On the 2nd September Herr Vogel fled the country, having contrived to pass the Iraq frontier on a false passport. The incident, following the rumours which had been diligently circulated in order to impair the Minister of Court’s credit, naturally caused a sensation and a further crop of rumours. According to Teymourtache himself, official examination of the bank’s books had revealed nothing worse than one or two extravangances and unwise trading, such as the purchase of £90,000 worth of carpets which had remained unsold. According to private sources, there had undoubtedly been transactions, which, if not fraudalent, were highly improper. 412. The news then reached Tehran that Herr Vogel had been detained at Beirut by the Syrian authorities, and that the Persian Government had applied for his extradition on a charge of embezzlement, the sum of £6,000 being mentioned. Herr Vogel, according to the official report, chose to commit suicide, but the Persians steadfastly refuse to accept this story as true, maintaining that a corpse dressed in Herr Vogel’s clothes was thrown over the cliffs, while the delinquent himself made his way to Bulgaria, which turned out to be his native country and not Germany. (Reports are also current that both he and Dr. Lindenblatt were G.P.U. agents. Another and more diverting report is to the effect that the former was a G.P.U. agent and the latter a German secret service agent, which would have made them strange bedfellows.) 413. Dr. Lindenblatt was thereupon reported to be on his way back to I ehran, the German Government having probably taken steps to persuade him to return, in the hope that he would be able to restore confidence in the National Bank and its German staff. The Persian Minister in Paris, Ala, who was also due to return to Persia about this time (October), was appointed to take over the presidency of the board of control, and was charged with the choice of Dr. Lindenblatt’s successor. No appointment was actually made before the end of the year, but it was known that the new manager would also be a German.71 V 414. Dr. Lindenblatt was still in Tehran under interrogation at the end of the year. There was little doubt that there was sufficient material to convict him of fraud, but the Persian authorities hesitated to bring him before the courts for fear that they might lose the benefit of a possible private arrangement whereby the doctor would voluntarily return a portion of his illgotten gains. The counsellor of the German Legation actually informed a member of the staff /*His Majesty’s Legation in this connexion that Dr. Lindenblatt had offered the Persian Government 200,000 reichsmarks, or, roughly, £22,000, to be allowed to go free. New Road Tax Law. 415. A new Road Tax Law, to come into force at the end of September and replacing the original Road Tax Law of the 6th February, 1926, was passed by the Majlis on the 30th August. 416. As was the case with the old law, a scale of taxation is laid down on the gross weight of imports and exports. The latter are to benefit by an export bonus system, while the former are to provide the increase in revenue which is expected from the new law. 417. Higher taxes mainly affect the luxuries, the import of which is prohibited under the Trade Monopoly Law, so that the general public remain unaffected, but they will result in an appreciable increase in the cost of living of His Majesty’s consular officers and the employees of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who, in the south, cannot do without a variety of imported food-stuffs and other “ luxuries.” The resident director of the company estimates that this increase in taxation will affect it to the extent of £40,000 a year, in spite of its greatly reduced staff. 418. On the subject of the export bonus His Majesty’s Minister reported as follows in his despatch No. 391 of the 10th September “ I have been in some doubt whether or not to protest against the principle of the export bonus, such a bonus being contrary to the spirit of article 3 of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty of 1928 and not provided for under the exchange of letters enclosed in Tehran despatch No. 238 of the 23rd May, 1928. I have decided not to do so pending an expression of the views of His Majesty’s Government. Past experience shows that the Persian Govern ment are never at a loss to find arguments to satisfy themselves that the action they have taken can be legally justified, and the cumulative result of ineffective protests is not good. Furthermore, the practical effect of export bonuses should be an automatic increase of imports in a country where the whole machinery of government is directed to making the volume of imports depend on that of exports. Teymourtache would undoubtedly maintain that this being theoretically indisputable, we had, as importers, nothing to complain about. .... ^ j i • ^ “As is frequently the case when a measure of doubtful wisdom or questionable legality is introduced, the export bonus is being represented as a weapon to be used against the Soviet Government, the idea being that the bonus will not be given in respect of Russian purchases for export in cases where it is established that the Soviet purchasing agencies have, by the exercise of the means of pressure which they command, obtained their goods unduly cheap.” 419. Article 6 of the law stipulates that the revenue from these road taxes is to be allotted as follows : 2,606,607 rials to public instruction, 724,130 rials to sanitary institutions, 878,800 rials to charitable institutions, 5,000,000 rials to the Tehran Municipality, 3,000,000 rials to provincial municipalities, and the balance, minus 3 per cent, for costs of collection, to the Road Fund. [8706] F 472 (B) Trade. Trade in General (1932). 420. The year opened with all markets desperately dull. Iheie &amp; feeling of hopelessness in the air, resulting from the low volume of business done in the foregoing months, the vexatious nature of the Trade Monopoly iegulations and the further restrictions and disturbances to trade which the (aovei nmert^ were known to be intent on introducing in the near future. The fluctuations in the exchange market contributed to the general feeling of insecunty, while the depreciation in the local currency added to the heavy burden alieady borne by importers and consumers. The Soviets showed no real desire to reach an equitable settlement with the Persian Government, and their purchases of Persian products continued on a very small scale. Ihe winter was exceptionally severe and communications seriously interfered with. January coincided with the fasting month of Ramazan, when trade activity is always at a low ebb. The cumulative effect of these adverse factors was, indeed, most depressing. 421. As shown in the following section, it was only in March that the Government’s sugar and match agreement with the Soviets came into force. The average Persian merchant always dabbled in sugar and looked upon it as his standby in view of its exceptionally “ liquid ” character. The dislocation which resulted from the Government’s monopoly of the import and sale ex customs of this commodity was consequently generally disconcerting. Arrivals from Soviet Russia were both irregular and inadequate, and what with the Government s determination to make a profit of at least 3^ krans a man (equivalent to nearly l\d. a pound) prices rose to extraordinary levels. In Tehran, for instance, the quotation in December was 22J krans to the batman, or over %\d. to the pound. 422. The Government’s clumsy and rapacious handling of the whole sugar question and its effect on prices affords an excellent example of their disregard for the purchasing power and general well-being of the masses of the people, in whose diet sugar is an essential item. It is interesting to note, incidentally, from the following table showing how the landed cost of sugar in Tehran is arrived at, what a comparatively small portion of the total costs is represented by the transport factor, so formidable are the various taxes which the Persian Govern ment now levy on imports :— Cost of sugar at the border : 3-70 rials per man, or (at 102) 1 • 33d. per lb. :— Rials. (a) Customs duty ... ... ... 1*55 (b) Monopoly tax ... ... ... 2-00 (c) Surtax on (a) and (b) at 160 per cent. ... 5-68 (d) Road tax ... ... ... ... 1-30 (e) Government profit ... ... ... 3-50 14 03 (/) Export certificate ... ... ... 1-50 (g) Transport from Mohammerah ... 3 00 4-50 Cost of sugar landed Tehran : 22-23 rials per man, or (at 102) just under 8d. per lb. 423. Although trade was very much restricted, merchants found it increasingly difficult to finance their business. Conditions being generally unsatisfactory, the banks cut down their credit risks. Capital was increasingly withdrawn from commerce and invested in land and industry. The capitalisa tion of the Iran Trading Corporation, the aims of which are discussed below, accentuated the tightness of money, so much so that in August trade credits were reported to cost 15 to 25 per cent, per mensem. 424. In October a slight improvement set in, the fall in exchange being particularly welcome, but the purchases effected by the villagers after the harvest73 led to nothing like the usual seasonal briskness. Dr. Friedlieb’s return in November revived the uncertainty and despondency engendered by the talk of fresh monopolies both of imports and exports. Relations with the Soviets seemed to go from bad to worse. A boycott of the Soviet trading agencies in Gilan was actually introduced on the 22nd December. On the 24th December the Minister of Court, who was chiefly responsible for the new economic and commercial jjJicy, was relieved of his functions. The year having completed its cycle, Ivamazan was back again and the bazaars relapsed into their slumbers, now attended by a stronger element of uneasiness than ever. 425. Even the Persian customs statistics for the six months March- September show an adverse balance of 65-7 million rials as compared with a favourable balance of 57-8 millions for the corresponding six months of 1931. These figures give an idea of how bad trade must have been in 1932, but they indicate even more clearly how fictitious were the figures previously published and how small the measure of success which the customs have met with in their efforts to check abusive undervaluation of imports and equally abusive over valuation of exports—a subject which has been dealt with above in “ the Balance of Trade.” Balance of Trade (1931-32). 426. According to the figures published by the Persian Customs, the balance of Persia’s international trade during the year ended the 21st March, 1932, as compared with the previous year, was as follows :— (In 1,000 krans and sterling.) 1309 1310 Increase or (1930-31). (1931-32). Decrease. Per cent. Imports 810,528 (£12,784,360) 604,000 (£7,299,100) - 25-5 — 42-9 Exports— (Jeneral 458,845 (£7,237,305) 654,800 f 42-7 (£7,912,990) 4* 9*3 Oil 1,004,974 941.200 — 6-3 (£15,851,335) (£11,374,010) - 28-2 Total exports .. 1.463,819 1,596,000 4- 9-0 or or (£23,088,640) (£19,287,000) - 16-4 Total trade 2,274,348 2,200,000 - 3-2 or or (£35,873,000) (£26,586,100) - 25-9 Excess of exports over imports, including 653,291 992,000 + 51-8 oil shipments or (£10,304,277) or (£11,987,900) + 16-3 Trade balance, excluding oil shipments .. - 351,683 + 50,800 or or (£5,547,055) (£613,890) Hates of conversion : 1930-31 63'40 krans to the £. 1931-32 82-75 „ 427. The conversions into sterling, it should be noted, have been made at the average of the official, and wholly inoperative, rates fixed by the Government during these two years. The average bazaar rates, at which business was actually conducted, can be roughly assessed at 85 and 97 krans (or i ials) to the pound sterling. 428. On the other hand, the introduction of the Trade Monopoly Law in March 1931, with a system of import licences and negotiable export certificates,not only stimulated smuggling into the country on an unprecedented scale, but also encouraged Persian merchants to undervalue imports and overvalue exports with the collusion of Persian customs officials. To offset these practices 15 per cent, was added to the official import figures, and 30 per cent, was deducted from the official export figures for March-December 1931 (see paragraph 362 of the 1931 report). Subsequent experience, however, has shown that fully 30 per cent, should probably be added to the official statistics of imports other than those 0*., the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (which are probably accurate enough) in order to allow, in addition to smuggling, for the systematic undervaluation which the Soviet trade organisations are known to resort to, as well as Persian merchants. 429. The following table incorporates these amendments, i.e., 30 per cent, has been added to the 1931-32 official statistics of imports other than those of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and 30 per cent, subtracted from the official statistics of exports other than oil, while the conversions into sterling have been worked out at the average bazaar, instead of the official, rates of exchange. It will be found that the resulting figures are in much closer accord with those of previous years, allowing for the fall in the world price level and the fall in Persian purchasing power :— (Revised table in sterling only.) — 1309 (1930-31). 1310 (1931-32).

Imports— General A.P.O.C At bazaar rate 85. ±7,172,388 £3,186,255 At bazaar rate 97. £6,739,793 £1,042,080 Per cent. - 6*0 - 67-3 Total imports .. £10,358,643 £7,782,165 — 24-8 Exports— General Oil £5,398,176 £11,823,223 £4,725,361 £9,703,093 - 12-4 — 17-9 Total exports £17,221,399 £14,428,454 — 162 Total trade £27,580,042 £22,210,619 — 19-5 Excess of exports (including oil) over imports £6,862,756 £6,646,289 - 3-1 Excess of imports over exports, excluding oil £1,774,212 £3,056,804 + 72-2 430. Various adjustments still remain to be made. In 1930-31 an apparent adverse balance of £4-14 million was to all intents and purposes wiped out by subtracting the imports of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the company’s local expenditure (paragraph 338 of the 1931 report). In the following year, however, a smaller apparent adverse balance, amounting to £3 million, is only reduced by £1-4 million (see below), when these two factors are taken into consideration, leaving Persia with an adverse balance of £1*6 million for 1931-32. 431. This computation is necessarily nothing more than approximate, but it can be said to be unaffected by other invisible items—the expenditure incurred by foreign missions and commercial organisations in Persia, for instance, being probably offset by the growing obligations of the Persian Government abroad, particularly as regards State supported students. It is also confirmed by the Imperial Bank of Persia’s experience of the exchange market and the course of trade generally during the year. 432. The effect on the national economy of the recent restrictions in the operations of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company due to world conditions is well brought out in the following table, supplied by the company’s Tehran office confidentially. It will be seen that the actual shipments of oil from Persia show hardly any change, but this merely emphasises the unfavourable marketing75 conditions with which the company has had to contend, while it is also true that a good deal of the oil shipped in 1931-32 was extracted the year before :—■ 1931-32. 1930-31.

Owing to the fact that, consequent on the introduction of the quota system in June 1931, the economic year now runs from June to June, the Persian Customs do not propose to publish any detailed statistics for the foreign trade of the country during the year ended March 1932. The task of culling figures from the bulletins which are published by the Customs monthly is extremely arduous, and it has only been attempted in the case of textiles, which still form the major imports from the United Kingdom into Persia. The results of this investigation are given below. 434. It will be remembered that for 1930-31 the surprising increase in the trade of the United Kingdom, amounting to 18 per cent, on a kran basis—in spite of a 21 • 5 per cent, fall in the import of Manchester goods—was attributed to the substantial increase in the imports of British machinery, tools, metals, &amp;c., effected by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. As has already been seen, these imports were very much restricted in 1931—32, while imports of British cottons were only very slightly higher on a kran basis than those of the year before, and decidedly lower when’'measured in sterling. According to the figures published in the foregoing section (“the Balance of Trade —cf I able II), the imports of the country as a whole were down 15 per cent., when calculated in sterling, and there is little doubt that (largely owing to the reduced Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s imports) the United Kingdom s and British Empire s peicentage of the total import trade was slightly lower than the year before. (i) Cotton Goods .—Imports during the year ended the 22nd March, 1932, of all denominations of cotton piece-goods, which formed 27-7 per cent, of the total imports, showed an increase of 17'4 per cent, on a kian basis, and on a sterling basis a decrease of 10 per cent. Russia, who increased hei impoits by 24-6 per cent., was the largest importer, with 53-7 per cent, of the total, as compared with 50-6 per cent, in the previous year; the United Kingdom, whose imports were increased by 15 per cent., only accounted for 19-9 per cent., as compared with 23 1 per cent.; India, with an increase of 211 per cent., claimed 15 per cent as compared with 14-5 per cent.; Japan, who increased her imports by no less than 163-6 per cent., took 6-5 per cent., as compared with 2-9 per cent ; Italy’s imports showed a decrease of nearly 33 per cent., her share of the total beimr 4-1 per cent., against 6-4 per cent. A strong attack on the cotton P 1 ^ 6 ' rood's market was made by Japan in 1932. Southern Persia was supplied through the Gulf ports, whilst Tehran was principally fed from Bagdad. Except for the higher grades of shirtings, poplins, &amp;c., which remain a monopoly of the United Kingdom, it seems probable that the Manchester trade will m future be seriously affected by the double menace from Russia and Japan.76 (ii) Cotton Yams. —In cotton yarns India, according to Persian official statistics, accounted for 89-2 per cent, of the total imports, her imports having increased by 58-9 per cent, since last year; Japan lost nearly 62 per cent., her share being just over 6 per cent, this year, but this may be due to a new practice of shipping from Japan to Bombay in the first instance, in which case a substantial portion of the imports returned as Indian may be Japanese. Total imports were nearly 50 per cent, more than last year, possibly due to the loc installation of weaving-mills and encouragement of local industries. (iii) Pure Woollens. —In all woollen goods Belgium, who increased her trade by 82-4 per cent., accounted for 54-2 per cent, of the total imports, which were 20 per cent, less than last year, at the expense of the United Kingdom (loss 75-4 per cent., share of total 4-9 per cent.), France (loss 44-3 per cent., share of total 19-7 per cent.), Italy (loss 32-3 per cent., share of total 10-7 per cent.) and Poland (loss 33-3 per cent., share of total 5-8 per cent.). Here again the formidable Belgian increase may be more apparent than real, being due perhaps to a change in trading practice. It was certainly known that the Persian Customs returns for imports of British woollens covered appreciable Belgian shipments forwarded from United Kingdom ports. (iv) Mixtures. —In cotton and wool mixtures the United Kingdom improved her position by 10-9 per cent, with 41-2 per cent, of the total imports; Belgium, though her imports fell 48*7 per cent., still claimed 28-8 per cent.; similarly, Italy, though dropping 53 1 per cent., retained 15-9 per cent, of the toal, which showed a decrease of over 40 per cent., when compared with last year’s figures. Note. —The above figures have been taken from the monthly bulletins of the Persian customs, and no allowance has been made for undervaluation. The following table for the total imports of cotton piece-goods, which was supplied by the Customs at the special request of His Majesty’s Legation and is more likely to be correct, differs from the figures quoted above mainly in respect of United Kingdom imports, which show an increase on a kran basis of 8*3 per cent., as against 1-5 per cent, only :— 1930-31. 1931-32. Increase Rials. Rials. per cent. 72,404,439 90,000,000 +24-3 U.S.S.R. United Kingdom ... 32,884,811 35,620,000 + 8-3 India ... ... 20,725,821 25,120,000 +21-2 On this basis of calculation Soviet Russia now imports almost 50 per cent, more cotton goods than the United Kingdom and India put together. It should also be remembered that imports from U.S.S.R. are more likely to be consistently undervalued than any other. Exports (1931-32). 435 No figures are available for this year other than those already quoted in the section entitled “ The Balance of Trade.” The Russo-Persian Commercial Treaty. 436. As mentioned in paragraph 356 of the 1931 report, the entry into force of this treaty was conditional on the exchange of ratifications, while this was, in turn, subject to an agreement being reached in the matter of the purchase of sugar and matches, the import of which into Persia was to be a Soviet monopoly. Although the quantities of these commodities to be delivered by the Russians (55,000 tons of loaf, 20,000 tons of crystals and 130,000 cases of matches per annum for three years) were settled in December, as well as the price factor, the question of the intervals at which deliveries were to be effected constituted a serious difficulty owing to the Persian anxiety lest the Russians should ration them as they thought fit. The two parties were finally able to come to terms, however, and a Bill was passed by the Majlis on the 10th March authorising the Government to operate the sugar and match monopolies * c on a commercial basis and to borrow 3 million tomans for the purpose. The profit from this source is estimated in the 1932-33 budget at 45 million rials (say, £450,000), to be credited77 to the general revenue of the country, and it has already been made manifest that it will not be realised without a rise in prices, which must particularly affect the poorer classes of the population. 437. It was not until the 22nd June that ratifications were exchanged in Moscow, but that did not prevent the sugar and match agreements from coming f to force as soon as they were concluded. Import licences, within the quotas laid wn in the treaty, were also issued to the Soviet Trade organisations as from the 1st January. 438. These organisations were overhauled and centralised as the result of the treaty. Owing to the fact that the Russian sugar (as well as the matches) was to be delivered to the Persian Customs at the port of entry, there was no further need for Persakhar, which consequently disappeared. Sharq, the general trading concern, for which Persian officialdom harboured a particular loathing as the very embodiment of Soviet economic oppression, has also been done away with. A clean sweep seems to have been made of inland agencies in Isfahan, Shiraz and Kerman, the intention being to supply these towns from Tehran, Bushire and Bandar Abbas respectively. Kermanshah is also to be controlled from Hamadan, as the result of the great restriction, imposed by means of the quota system, on imports via Bagdad, including all the sugar, tea and matches. Bureauperse (transport), Intourist (travel), Persaznaft (oil), Perskhlop (cotton) and Exportmachine (machinery) have retained their separate entities, but they are now under the direct control of Torgpred, the Soviet commercial repre sentative, who has his headquarters in Tehran and branch offices in provincial towns such as Tabriz and Sistan. 439. The hopefulness with which the Persians conducted the negotiations which ended with the ratification of the commercial treaty with Soviet Russia was certainly not improved by the failure of the Russians to honour the under takings, into which they had entered in the early days of the trade monopoly, to export Persian products to the value of their imports before the end of 1931. Their continued failure to do so, and the growing disparity between their imports and their exports, rendered relations all the more strained as month followed month in 1932, without Torgpred showing any honest desire to adjust accounts. It was this lack of goodwill, possibly more than the actual deficit in the commercial exchanges between the two countries (amounting to 25 million odd rials, or roughly £250,000, for the nineteen months ending the 22nd September, 1932), which so enraged and embittered the Persians. 440. During the course of an interview which took place at the end of September, the Minister of Court informed His Majesty’s Minister that, during his own illness, the Soviet Ambassador and his subordinates had conducted a vigorous propaganda, intended to convince the Persian Government and the commercial community generally that, in the present disastrous economic state of the country, the Soviet Government could not deliver the imports which they were bound to deliver unless the transactions were financed by the Persian Government, and they had apparently been so far successful that the Prime Minister, Minister of Finance and others had given some vague endorsement to this astounding thesis. The result was that on his Highness’s return to work he had to act with considerable energy. In fact, he told the Soviet representatives that, whatever his colleagues might have said, not one rial of credit would be granted by the Persian Government in order to relieve the Soviet Government of their obligations. His Highness went on to say that one of his preoccupations when negotiating the commercial treaty had been lest the Soviet Government, by one means or another, should manage to evade their obligations to import. Such a development would, of course, be absolutely disastrous to the normal economic life of the country, but at the time he had found no means of definitely guarding against it. He had now found himself confronted with this danger, and he had little doubt that the Soviet authorities were seeking to place him in the unpleasant dilemma of having to choose between a shortage of imports, with all the odium that would attach to the Government, and accepting financial responsibility for them, which would strengthen the economic and political position of the Soviets. He had told the Soviet representatives precisely what he though of their bare faced attempt to have it both ways, and had then arranged a meeting with78 Torgpred, which was attended by certain officials on both sides and leading Persian merchants. He had summarised the grievances of the Persian merchants, and then proposed that if the Soviet Government were genuinely short of funds in Persia and were really under the impression that Persian buyers were not in a position to effect payments, the Persian Government would purchase all Russian imports, and deposit in a bank all sums as they became due, the funds thus formed being available for Soviet purchases in Persia. Teymourtache went on to s^\ that the Soviet commercial representative had accepted this proposal, subject, perhaps, to reference to higher authority, but to the Minister of Court’s wrath and indignation, he had denied the fact in an official communique published in Tass soon afterwards. 441. This attitude of the Minister of Court, it should be noted, is in striking contrast with the opinion he expressed to Sir Robert Clive in May 1930, as related in paragraphs 265 and 266 of the annual report for that year. Subsequent developments also proved the fundamental fallacy of the views then held by Teymourtache as regards Soviet Russia’s “ need ” of certain Persian exports. 442. Furthermore, the Persian Government came to realise in 1932 that Russian purchases of Persian products were by no means an unmixed blessing. All was well when the Russians bought for their own needs, e.g., cotton and rice, but when they bought fruits, gum, carpets, &amp;c., for the purpose of realising foreign exchange on world markets, their sales were as often as not below their landed costs, thereby ruining the trade for all other exporters of Persian produce. This has been particularly true for carpets, so much so that the Persian Govern ment themselves profess to be determined to exclude the Russians from this trade altogether. This, however, is only part of a comprehensive scheme which aims at centralising Russo-Persian trade in the hands of a syndicate of Persian merchants (see paragraphs 458-459 below), who would in effect enjoy a monopoly of trade with Russia, among other advantages, and who would consequently only sell to the Russians what was considered good for them. If the Russians refused to deal with the syndicate direct, then they would be invited to deal with the Persian Government, who would appoint the syndicate their buying and selling agents. The Russians in some way or other must be persuaded to guarantee the purchase of minimum yearly quantities of those Persian exports for which no other market than the Russian could at present be found, especially rice and cotton. 443. This policy called for radical amendments to the commercial treaty with the Soviet Government, and in order to bring matters to a head and have some excuse for claiming that the hands of the Persian Government had been forced by Persian vested interests, the Minister of Court set to work during the summer of 1932 to play on the feelings of the Persian merchants, insisting that it must pay them ultimately to show a united front against the Russians and put an end to the economic duresse in which they sought to hold Persia. By a mixture of threats and promises, he succeeded in persuading the merchants of Gilan to enforce an actual boycott of the Russian trading and transport organisations. This set in on the 22nd December, Persian truculence going to the length of picketing the Russian offices and bringing their business to a standstill. The Russian counterblast took the form of three ultimata, which were delivered on the 1st January to the Governor of Gilan, the Director of the Depart ment of Commerce and the Shah’s factotum respectively, to the effect that, if the boycott were not called off before the 5th January— (a) organisations in Gilan would be closed and the The Russian trade personnel sent back to Russia. (b) All Russian purchases of Persian products would cease forthwith. (c) The Shah’s sale of his 1932 rice crop to the Russians would be cancelled. (It may be noted in this connexion that no other part of this year’s crop had been bought up to the end of the year, to the intense distress of the two great producing Provinces of Gilan and Mazanderan.) 444. Once again the Persian cat had scratched the Russian bear. The bear had reacted swiftly, and it remained to be seen whether the cat might stage a not too undignified and perhaps even a strategic retreat, attended by one or two minor tactical successes.79 Reaction of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom to Russian Commercial Treaty. 445. Sir John Simon’s despatch to Mr. Hoare, No. 61 of the 26th January, 1932, contained the following instructions regarding the attitude to be adopted in the matter of the Russian treaty :— ^ “I shall be glad if you will be guided in your future conduct by the views expressed in the Board of Trade’s letter of the 19th January. You will observe that, in their opinion, notwithstanding the difficulty of attaching a precise meaning to the most-favoured-nation clause in its bearing upon quota schemes, His Majesty’s Government would be entitled to protest if Persia allocated to the Soviet Government such a quota in respect of any particular class of commodity (commodities subject to a real monopoly may be an exception) as would involve material discrimination against United Kingdom trade. It appears, however, to the Board that the actual quotas allotted to Russia under the recent Soviet-Persian treaty, though in some cases larger than they should be if strict regard were paid to past trading, nevertheless leave open a sufficient proportion of Persia’s trade for competition by British and other foreign traders to render it unwise to enter a protest which might possibly prejudice your negotiations for the adoption of the scheme defined in your despatch No. 624 of the 3rd November. I request therefore that you will for the present concentrate on an attempt to reach a satisfactory agreement with the Persian Government on the basis of that scheme.” 446. This scheme was originally submitted to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in October 1931 during the absence of the Minister of Court in Europe; it appeared to safeguard the interests of the Persian Government, and, as was mentioned in paragraph 361 of last year’s report, there seemed every chance of it coming into force on the Persian New Year. Subsequently it appeared desirable, from our point of view and at the same time from the Persian, to amend the project in certain particulars, and the final form in which it was put before Teymourtache by the commercial secretary on the 21st February, 1932, was as follows :— (a) Quarterly quotas. (5) Import licences to be issued within a week— (c) Either against export certificates or without discrimination against a bank guarantee to pay the Government a sum equal to 20 or 25 per cent, of the amount involved in the event of the export certificates not being produced within six months. (d) The holder of the licence to be allowed to effect his import within the next six months. (e) In no case, however, would he be authorised to clear the goods before producing the export certificates, whether or not he had been mulcted in the fine foreseen in (c). (/) (An additional sanction.) The Department of Commerce, except where a case of force majeure had been clearly demonstrated, would refuse to issue further licences to any merchant who had failed to make use of a previous licence in the twelve months laid down in (c) and (d) above. 447. The suggestion that bank guarantees should be acceptable in lieu of export certificates was included not so much out of practical considerations, as with a view to press the principle that importers of British goods should, as far as possible, be granted the same facilities as the Russians. But Teymourtache proved both unsympathetic and obdurate. He would only authorise the immediate issue of import licences to British firms if His Majesty’s Government guaranteed that they would take up blocks of import quotas, as the Russians were doing, and export Persian products to the same value—which was clearly out of the question. As for bank guarantees, he was only interested in a form of guarantee which covered 100 per cent, of the value of the imports, so that the Persian Government should themselves be able to export in the event of the importer failing to honour his undertaking to do so. His Highness generally gave the impression that the Trade Monopoly Law was born of his own inspiration and, as such, perfect and not to be trifled with.80 448. On the question of our claim to most-favoured-nation treatment, the Minister of Court proved equally uncompromising, making light of the argument that British interests could not be treated in exactly the same fashion as the Russian by suggesting that all His Majesty’s Government had to do to remedy the situation was to follow the Russian and Persian examples by monopolising the trade of the United Kingdom. 449. His Highness, on this occasion as on many others, propounded TNo' favourite idea that groups of importers and exporters should be formed in each country interested in Persian trade to take up Persian import quotas on a large scale, in which case they would be granted all manner of advantages, not excluding monopolistic rights—as was proved when Dr. Friedlieb came to negotiate with Teymourtache (paragraphs 462-465)—the advantages to Persia being manifold : these foreign associations, by guaranteeing imports, would ipso facto guarantee that they would be legitimately imported and not smuggled into the country; they would at the same time guarantee exports to an equivalent value, and powerful foreign interests could be relied upon to bring their financial resources and technical skill to bear on the improvement and development of the Persian export trade. 450. The absurd lengths to which his Highness was prepared to go in support of this idee fixe was clearly indicated when he suggested to the American Minister in March that the United States might apply for that part of the cotton piece-goods quota (45 per cent.) which the Russians had not already got. Mr. Hart’s reply, to the effect that this proposition seemed to him entirely uneconomic, confirmed the statement made to Teymourtache by the commercial secretary at His Majesty’s Legation, that he could not expect British firms to guarantee imports of any article in which the Russians were interested—and that applied to the great majority of our imports—owing to the well-known Russian readiness to undercut their competitors at any price, even if the other major difficulty of guaranteeing exports (again in competition with the Russians) could be overcome. Amendments to the Trade Monopoly Law. 451. Mr. Hoare found the Minister of Court in a more conciliatory mood on the 12th April, when his Highness stated that he could now see his way to have import licences issued more quickly, and it was to this point that British firms had always attached the most importance. At the end of the month the Council of Ministers issued a decree to the effect that the import quotas for the second economic year (opening on the 22nd June, 1932) should be quarterly instead of half-yearly, four periods being fixed during which applications for the following quarter would be entertained. Import licences would also be issued within twenty days of the expiration of each one of these periods. This arrangement, however, proved of short duration (see paragraph 457 below). 452. The Foreign Trade Monopoly (Amendment) Act was passed by the Majlis on the 10th July. Its main object was to incorporate in a simpler form the former laws and regulations which it superseded, but this particular aim has been defeated by certain obscurities, and the failure of the authorities to publish the regulations which were to interpret the law, where needed, and complement it. 453. Certain new features, however, appear. The basic principle is to ensure the true balance of trade and of exchange operations by making the payment of imports dependent not on customs valuations, which proved grossly misleading in the past, but on the actual prices obtained from exports. Thus, under article 8 (b), applications for import licences will only be accepted if supported by export certificates “ of which the exchange undertaking has been fulfilled,” equal to the amount of the application; while article 7 (1) stipulates that exchange bought on the open market will not be accepted for the purpose. Soviet organisations, being dispensed from this dual obligation of submitting export certificates and “ sale of exchange certificates,” scored once more. 454. It is true that article 8 (/) foresees the acceptance of a bank guarantee as an alternative—in deference, presumably, to the wish expressed by His Majesty’s Legation—but in the absence of special regulations the system has not been put into force. It offers such unpremeditated advantages that it clearlynever will be adopted in its present form, the Government having omitted to notice that the bank was merely being called upon to guarantee the production of sale of exchange certificates within the prescribed six months—no mention being made of export certificates, the price of which has varied between 18 and 25 per cent, (free of exchange obligations) during the year. —* 455. The following points are also of interest:— (1) Under the original Trade Monopoly Law exporters of monopolised goods (opium and tambaku) were only given export certificates, which the} could either sell or use to obtain import licences, to the value of 20 per cent, of their exports. Under article 6 (b) of the new law this was extended to 55 per cent, as a concession to the opium group, who were in difficulties. (2) Under article 7 (k) the rate for exporters’ exchange was fixed at 28 rials to the dollar, other rates fluctuating in terms of the New York exchange market. (3) The valuation to be placed on imports is laid down in article 9 (a) as the wholesale price ruling at the place of entry. “ In the absence of a wholesale price market at the place of entry of the goods, the whole sale price ruling at the nearest market shall be taken as a basis.” However, “customs duty and taxes, and transport charges from the frontier to the place of entry (when the customs post is some distance from the frontier as in the case of Kermanshah and Duzdap) shall be deducted from the wholesale price.” 456. This Persian insistence on a right conferred by treaty (and the disregard of invoices for purposes of valuation which it connotes) is important, as it not only means that the importer requires more comprehensive and therefore more expensive import licences than would otherwise be the case, but it subjects him to higher import duties, and occasionally to the payment of import duties which he would otherwise have escaped altogether. It is only cars valued at £300 and over, for instance, which pay a duty (amounting to 10 per cent.), but even Fords and Chevrolets are being made to pay—a new eight-cylinder Ford in Tehran costing £450, so terrific are the various charges on imports. 457. As already mentioned, no regulations implementing the Trade Monopoly (Amendment) Act had been published by the end of 1932, but in September force was given to a decision of the Council of Ministers that appli cations for a twelfth of any given yearly quota would be considered at any time. The quota system was thereby put on to an annual instead of a quarterly basis, thus accentuating the monopolistic tendency which was already so noticeable in the conduct of Persian trade—it being made easy for merchants, who had formed themselves into a secret association, to apply individually for one-twelfth and obtain in the aggregate such a large proportion of the quota as to enable them to vvj the market. In fact, one is inclined to suspect that this decision can be largely attributed to the Minister of Court’s determination to help his latest creation, the Iran Trading Corporation, in every possible way. The Department of Commerce, thereafter, periodically published lists of exhausted quotas. The Iran Trading Corporation. 458. The Minister of Court’s attempts in 1930 and 1931 to form syndicates of Persian merchants in all the northern trading centres to trade with the Russians “on equal terms” proved a signal failure, because of the coercive measures employed by the local authorities and the conviction of the merchants that the capital they were asked to subscribe amounted to a capital levy. At the beginning of 1932, on the other hand, there were many who thought that a united front against the Russians had become imperative; the new commercial treaty with the Soviet Government already looked as if it might prove of no more avail than its predecessor, while Teymourtache, for his part, w T as desperately anxious to show that the monopoly of foreign trade might prove of some benefit after all. 459. A new syndicate, which was soon to adopt the title of the Iran Trading Corporation, with the Minister of Court himself as president, was formed [8706] g82 In Tehran towards the end of March with a nucleus of thirty to forty of the capital's leading merchants, the main objective of which was given out to be the standardisation and general improvement of the country’s exports. It was said at the time that the corporation would not have a monopoly of exports, but would set up an organisation to control exports, i.e., to pass them as fit for shipment, and the Russians would have to conform to the new regulations in the same way as anyone else. A secondary objective would perhaps be the industrialisation''^ of the country according to plan. There can be little doubt, however, that the Iran Trading Corporation in its founder’s mind was created first and foremost with the idea of wrestling with the Russian problem. 460. The corporation, although estimates of its real needs varied between 10 and 30 million tomans, was to have a capital of 2 million tomans, of which a little over 1 million was alleged to have been subscribed by the Tehran nucleus alone. According to information received at the end of September, only 400,000 tomans had by then been collected in cash, and but one commercial transaction, unprofitable as it proved, put through. This meagre result was achieved in 'spite of the carefully spread reports of the extraordinary advantages to be conferred on the corporation—whose high destiny, it transpired, would be to monopolise the whole trade of the country—and the rumoured participation of 400 merchants all over Persia, each of whom thought it politic to have a finger in the pie while limiting his financial commitments to a minimum. 461. Just about the time of the corporation's foundation a Petrograd Jew, named Dr. Friedlieb (who happened to have been born in Persia, but who had recently adopted Persian nationality for convenience’ sake), appeared on the scene with the idea of doing with the United States direct the trade in Persian products which had hitherto been done through Constantinople, London and other big ports. With this end in view he had formed, under the auspices of the president of the Phoenix National Bank, the Persian American Trading Corporation, with offices in New York, of which corporation he was appointed managing director. He was accompanied on his first visit to Persia by a Mr. Porter, a member of a well-known American firm in the fur business, who forthwith toured Persia with a view to assess the value of its exportable furs and lambskins. 462. Dr. Friedlieb, on hearing that the Iran Trading Corporation was to be charged with the standardisation of exports, must have immediately conceived the idea of taking a substantial share in it. He also found that there was a talk of monopolies in the air—monopolies of the import of sugar and matches had just been granted to the Russians—and he brightly expounded the principle that to make it worth while setting up a first-class organisation to deal with certain exports, both at the Persian and the foreign ends, he and his Persian colleagues must be granted certain monopolistic rights. The balance of trade being the order of the day, it seemed only logical that in return for the monopolies of certain exports, which he hoped to dispose of in the United States chiefly, they should also be granted monopolies of the principal American imports into Persia : motor vehicles and tyres. Whether the idea of import monopolies, which has been strenuously contested by the American Legation in Tehran as a contravention of the American policy of the open door, was first adumbrated by Dr. Friedlieb, Teymourtache, or some Persian member of the corporation, is not known. Dr! Friedlieb himself gives out that it was forced upon him by Teymourtache, who wished to standardise Persia’s means of motor transport. 463. His final proposals appear to have been the following :— (a) That the Iran Trading Corporation be capitalised at 3 million tomans, approximately 1 million dollars, half to be subscribed locally and half by the Persian-American Trading Corporation. (b) That the Iran Trading Corporation be granted the exclusive right to purchase in Persia for export: furs (including lambskins), dried fruits, gum, silk, sheep casings, and perhaps cigarette tobacco (the latter to be traded against machinery required by the Persian Tobacco Monopoly). (c) That the Iran Trading Corporation also be granted the monopoly of the import of motor vehicles and tyres.83 (d) That the Persian-American Trading Corporation be granted the exclusive foreign representation of the Iran Trading Corporation for the sale of Persian products and the purchase of its monopolised imports. (e) That the 50 per cent, participation of the Persian-American Trading Corporation in the Iran Trading Corporation confer upon it the ^ right to appoint half the board of directors and control the technical services of the Iran Trading Corporation. 464. Subsequently gum and silk were withdraw from the list of the proposed export monopolies, owing, apparently, to Russian pressure. Teymourtache, on the other hand, wished to add opium and carpets to the list. Regarding the latter, it had apparently not been decided before the end of the year whether this monopoly would best be handled by the Iran Trading Corporation or by a syndicate of old-established carpet exporters led by the Oriental Carpet Manufacturers (Limited), a firm which is nominally British, but actually Franco-Swiss, with a strong Levantine flavour. 465. Dr. Friedlieb left Persia in May with a seventy-five-day option, on behalf of the Persia-American Trading Corporation, to participate in the Iran Trading Corporation on the terms outlined above. This option was allowed to lapse, but Dr. Friedlieb returned to Tehran in November with a galaxy of American business men, representing the firms to which he proposed to confide the operation of the monopolies to be secured, and which were, it seems, expected to put up a large part of the 500,000 dollars required to buy a half share in the Iran Trading Corporation, viz. : General Motors (all motor vehicles); Goodrich (tyres); American Machine and Foundry (Limited) (tobacco machinery); Charles P. Porter (Incorporated) (furs); Sayer and Co. (Incorporated) (casings); Hills Brothers (dried fruits). 466. Negotiations were forthwith renewed on the basis of Dr. Fried!ieb’s original proposals, with which Teymourtache was understood to be in agreement. It remained, however, for the American business men involved to make a study of local conditions and recommend participation or abstention to their principals, while it took their leader time to re-establish contacts in political and commercial circles. The Persian Government’s difference of opinion with Soviet Russia, furthermore, culminating as it did in a boycott of Russian commercial and transport organisations, obviously required careful handling. On the 24th December the Minister of Court withdrew, or was withdrawn, from the political arena, and it seemed as if many of the children of his busy imagination might follow him in his retirement. Company Registration Law. 467. Following on representations made by His Majesty’s Legation, the Persian Government submitted a Bill to the Majlis, which was passed on the 17th March, reducing the registration tax imposed on shipping and air transport companies to a quarter, and on land transport companies to a third, of the usual scale (see, in this connexion, paragraph 375 of the 1931 report). Anglo-Persian Commercial Treaty. 468. There was no resumption of negotiations for this treaty. (C) Industry. General. 469. The year was notable for the materialisation of various industrial schemes and for a revulsion of feeling against German machinery. This was largely due to the German press campaign against the Shah, which offended Persian national sentiment, but also to the growing realisation that British machinery—now within Persian means as the result of the fall in the value of sterling—was distinctly preferable to German. [8706] H84 Textile Mills. 470. In May the Legation learnt of an order, value at £22,000, placed with Messrs. Fairbairn, Lawson, Combe, Barbour (Limited) of Leeds, for plant to be installed in a jute-spinning and weaving mill in Resht. The same firm, towards the end of the year, looked like securing an order worth £10,000 from the Shah for a jute mill to be erected in Aliabad (Mazanderan). 471. The cotton-spinning mill in Aliabad, which was put up in 1931, and equipped with German machinery under scandalous circumstances, was taken over and extended by His Majesty in 1932, all the orders (to the value of £54,000) going to British firms : Dobson and Barlow and Platt Brothers for spinning and weaving plant, and the General Electric Company and Crossley Brothers for electrical equipment. 472. The Shah, during the year, also expressed the intention of erecting a woollen mill with 3,000 spindles in Kermanshah, and there is reason to hope that the order (worth £20,000 to £30,000) will go to the United Kingdom. 473. Various schemes for putting up cotton-spinning mills in Meshed, Yezd and Kerman hung fire rather—others were spoken of for Qum, Isfahan, Shiraz and Bushire—but in every case there appeared to be a first-class chance of British firms securing the orders for the required machinery in the event of the mills materialising. Sugar Factories. 474. The old sugar factory built by a Belgian group at Kahrizak (about 12 miles south of Tehran) thirty-five years ago, and abandoned because the Russians took care that other crops should pay the peasants better than beet, was renovated with the help of German machinery on the initiative of the manager of the National Bank during 1931—one imagines a hopelessly uneconomic pro position—and officially opened by the Shah at the end of January 1932. It did not, however, start to function until September. 475. The entirely new sugar factory at Kerej (24 miles west of Tehran), finally equipped by a Czechoslovakian factory (Czeska Moravska), after the Persian Government had taken some eighteen months to make up their minds to whom they should give the order, was also opened by the Shah in the autumn. His Majesty is said to have been so pleased with what he saw that he ordered a similar plant to be ordered from the same suppliers for a third factory—with more to follow. 476. The total yearly output of the Kahrizak and Kerej factories together, which appear to have cost about £60,000 between them, is estimated at 7,000 tons, or roughly 8^ per cent, of the quantity imported through the Persian customs in recent years. The policy of the Government is to make Persia self-supporting where this commodity is concerned. Cement Factory. 477. The necessary plant for a factory to be constructed at Shah Abdul Azim, a few miles south of Tehran, was ordered from a Danish-Swedish concern. Details are lacking. Tehran Electric Power Scheme. 478. The Societe de Traction et d’Electricite of Brussels obtained a con cession in September to supply Tehran with electric power, and also, apparently, to introduce an up-to-date tramway system in the capital, to replace the antiquated horse-drawn vehicles run by another Belgian company, and extend it to Shimran, the summer station situated a few miles north of Tehran. The agree ment was finally signed in December or early in the New Year, in spite of the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s Concession and the serious mis givings it caused the Belgian Minister. 485 h 2 [8706] VII.— Opium. 479. The illicit shipment of 1,500 cases, referred to in paragraph 378 of last year’s report, did not materialise, the report that it had been effected having ^roved incorrect. The total exports for 1931, therefore, only amounted to 3,674 cases, as compared with 5,686 cases during the previous year, whereas Haji Amin had undertaken when the export monopoly was granted to him in October 1930 to ship no less than 6,500 cases a year—or in any case to pay the Government taxes on that amount. In 1932 there was a further sensational drop in exports to 1,775 cases (see table below). 480. In February His Majesty’s Legation learnt that Messrs. Ziegler and Co. of Manchester had been approached as early as October 1931 by a repre sentative of the Persian Minister of Finance, who wished to know whether they would take over the monopoly. This implied buying 6,000 cases from the Persian Government a year. Messrs. Ziegler replied that they could not do so as it would involve trading in contraband opium, but they might consider the purchase of 2,000 cases a year. In January 1932 Taqizadeh suggested that if Messrs. Ziegler were averse to a 100 per cent, monopoly they might be willing to undertake a monopoly of legitimate exports only, guaranteeing the Government an offtake of 2,500 cases and a tax payment of £83 per case as heretofore. Messrs. Ziegler, however, after going into the matter, realised that they could not possibly guarantee an annual purchase, as there appeared to be no important legitimate buyers of Persian opium in the market: consumption had been greatly reduced owing to the world crisis, and there was also a growing tendency for importing countries to go to Turkey and Serbia for their requirements, owing to the far higher price of Persian opium, weighted as it was by excessive taxation. In fact a case of Anatolian opium (less favoured by the smoker, it is true) could be had for approximately the same amount as the Persian Government so short sightedly exacted in taxes alone. 481. During the course of these negotiations the Persian Minister of Finance put forward the suggestion that, the world’s legitimate need of Persian opium having been met by exports of 2,500 cases, all the League need do, were it intent on putting an end to the contraband trade in Persian opium, would be to pay the Persian Government £83 a case on another 3,000 cases annually, which could be destroyed under the League’s supervision. The Persian Government would be satisfied with the revenue accruing from these two operations plus the proceeds of the banderole tax on opium prepared for local consumption. 482. It is not known whether Taqizadeh was quite so ingenuous as to expect the League to give such an undertaking irrespective of the size of the yearly crop, but the 1932 season has shown that it may on occasion shrink to very modest proportions as the result, not of official restriction, but of climatic and market conditions. Although it was reported excellent in Khorassan, the estimate in Pars was one-third of the normal, and the aggregate output for the year has been assessed at not more than 2,000 cases. This news delighted Haji Amin and his associates, as they argued that they could not be expected under such conditions to continue to pay the export duty on 6,500 cases as arranged (in spite of their accumulated stocks). On the other hand the grower was the more anxious that his small output should find a market at a greatly enhanced price, and the outcry was all the louder and denunciations of the monopoly all the more bitter when it refrained from buying any part of the new crop. About the end of August, when it was reported to have 6,000 cases on its hands, the monopoly ceased even to manufacture. On the 18th October the Tehran press reported that the con cession had been cancelled by mutual agreement, Haji Amin being obviously only too glad to rid himself of his responsibilities, while the Government had long since been forced to admit that the monopoly, like many of its other economic ventures, had proved an abysmal failure.483. The following table shows the exports of Persian opium during the last three years :— Destination. 1930. 1931. 1932 Licensed— Bangkok 750 200 Singapore Kuching (North Borneo) 50 100 Batavia Saigon ... 10 1,000 Macao 464 500 425 Formosa (Japanese) ... 694 200 150 Dairen (Japanese) 510 100 200 Marseilles 95 Hamburg 175 London 25 New York 100 Total licensed 2,863 1,110 1,775 Unlicensed— Vladivostok ... 2,823 1,762 Canton 802 Total unlicensed ... 2,823 2,564 Grand total 5,686 3,674 1,775 484. The 1932 total represents 31 -2 per cent, and 48-3 per cent, of the 1930 and 1931 totals respectively. The situation would have been truly desperate if the Saigon Monopoly, after its trial shipment of ten cases in 1931, had not decided to purchase 1,000 cases in 1932. 485. The absence of any unlicensed shipments during the year under review does not connote any noticeable change in the actual, as opposed to the declared, policy of the Persian Government, but rather a failure on the part of Haji Amin and his associates to make the most of their Far Eastern connexions. 486. Regarding the dispute over the 2,300 cases sold by Haji Amin to a Japanese firm (Sankyo Mitsubishi), of which mention was made in paragraph 379 of the 1931 annual report, the amount involved was reduced by mutual agreement first to 1,760 and later to 1,200 cases. Of these, 200 cases were shipped to Formosa in August 1931, 200 to Dairen in February 1932, and another 150 cases to Formosa in November 1932, leaving 650 cases on Sankyo’s hands. On the last shipment £60 per case seems to have been lost owing to the refusal of the Formosa Monopoly to pay more than £120 c.i.f., but £30 was made up on exchange differences. If there is any truth in the report that Sankyo (who are primarily piece-goods merchants) were granted exceptional facilities for the import of their cottons against their opium shipments, it is fortunate for British interests that they should have met with this reverse. 487. According to a well-qualified opium merchant, the total stocks held in Persia at the end of the year were :— Cases. Haji Amin and Co., in Bushire 5,100 Haji Amin and Co., elsewhere 500 Sankyo, in Bushire 650 In private hands, elsewhere ... 3,000-3,500 Total ... 9,250-9,750[8706] h 3 87 VIII.— Communications. (A) Aviation. General. 488. The Junkers service ceased to operate in March. For the rest of the “ir the Persian Government had before them the offers made by Airwork (Limited) and Luft Hansa to replace Junkers. The details of these negotiations are given below. The British, French and Dutch companies using the south coast route are dealt with elsewhere. Airwork {Limited). 489. Mr. Muntz, one of the partners in Airwork (Limited), visited Tehran in March in order to investigate the possibilities of establishing a service in Persia in connexion with the service which he was hoping to establish in Iraq. He obtained from the Minister of Court an assurance that if his firm became established in Iraq the Persian Government would be prepared to consider allowing it to run regular internal services in Persia; also that he might count on his aeroplanes being allowed to enter Persia on taxi work at short notice. His plans at that time included taking over from Junkers the activities contem plated by them in Iraq and also the Bagdad-Tehran and Tehran-Bushire services, for which their aeroplanes and experience would be used. 490. Shortly after his departure Junkers ceased suddenly to function, and His Majesty’s Minister suggested that an attempt might be made to take the question of the continued use of the Persian coast route by Imperial Airways out of the political negotiations that were then proceeding by telling the Persian Government that, in return for an extension, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would make it possible for Airwork to fill the breach by giving them a subsidy for a limited period. This suggestion was not, however, adopted (see under “ General Treaty Negotiations ”). 491. Mr. Muntz returned to Tehran in May, and then made the following offer to the Persian Government: he wished his firm, which were then operating in Iraq, {a) to be able to send aeroplanes into Persia on taxi flights at twenty-four hours’ notice; {b) to be allowed to run a service for mail, passengers and freight between Bagdad and Tehran on the following conditions : that the Persian Government should encourage all mail for Iraq to go by air, and pay the firm 85. per kilogramme for all mail carried; that the Persian Government should place the aerodromes at Tehran, Hamadan and Kermanshah at the firm’s disposal free of charge; and that the Persian Government should exempt the firm’s aircraft from all customs or transit charges. In return, the firm were prepared, provided the permission were valid for not less than two years, to examine in conjunction with the Persian Government the possibility of forming a Persian company to operate internal air services in Persia, to construct a service station capable of reconditioning civil and military aircraft and to establish a flying school; no exclusive concession or subsidy would be required, at any rate during the experimental stage. 492. As the Persian Government had made no reply to these proposals by August, when Herr Weil, of Junkers, returned to Tehran, enquiries were made by His Majesty’s Legation, and it was ascertained that the Persian Government had no intention of coming to a decision regarding a civilian air service before October. It appeared that the Minister of Court was leaving the question almost entirely in the hands of the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, who was almost continuously ill. 493. No decision had been taken by November, when Mr. Muntz wrote to His Majesty’s Minister that his firm in Iraq was now known as Iraq Airwork (Limited), and hoped to be appointed managing agents of an Iraqi national aviation company financed by the Iraq Government. Mr. Muntz asked whether permission could be obtained for the operation of a service to Tehran, and whether there was any prospect of obtaining the Persian mail at the rate of 85. 4c?. a kilogramme agreed to by the Iraq Government.88 494. The fact that Mr. Muntz’s firm was now to all intents and purposes an Iraqi firm somewhat altered the situation, but enquiries weie made as to the proposals made by Mr. Muntz in May were being received; and it was learned unofficially that, though an official decision was still awaited, the Ministry ot Posts and Telegraphs had reported favourably on Mr. Muntz s pi oposals, except as regards customs exemption, about which there was some obscme difficulty, thfw also thought the mail charge too high. V 495. By the end of the year Mr. Muntz’s arrangement with the Iraq Government was settled in principle, and he had decided to seek through them permission to run a service to Tehran, without pressing for the moment foi a mail contract. As regards Luft Hansa, he contemplated a profit-shai ing ai lange- ment under which each would act as agents for the other, Airwork in Bagdad and Luft Hansa in Tehran. Junkers and Luft IIansa. 496. At the beginning of the year it seemed certain that Junkers would close down in February, when their five-year contract expired, as neither they nor the Persian Government appeared disposed to give way over the terms of a new contract, and more especially over the question of the construction of an aeroplane factory in Persia, upon which the Shah was believed to set great store. But shortly after the return of the Minister of Court from Europe early in February, it was announced that a three months’ extension had been granted, which would enable the company to operate until Herr Weil, the manager, who had to go to Germany, ostensibly for an operation, was available to continue the negotiations. This decision may have been due to failure by the Persian Government to find a suitable successor to Junkers from some other country. 497. The three months’ period was never completed, however, for on the 24th March the acting manager received instructions from Germany that he was to close down the service at once unless the Persian Government undertook to make good the existing monthly deficit, which was believed to reach £1,000. The Persian Government, who were given until the evening of the 26th March to reply, declined, as was expected, to accept these terms, with the result that the departures of all further aeroplanes from Tehran were cancelled, though those away returned according to schedule. Most of the German personnel left during the following few weeks, and it was at first intended to send the aeroplanes away as well. But, finally, the aeroplanes were left on the aerodrome, with one or two mechanics in charge, and the aerodrome was kept up sufficiently to allow of visiting aeroplanes (including the company’s aeroplane on charter to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company) to continue using it. The departure of Junkers, who maintained to the end their reputation of having never injured a passenger or lost a parcel, was the cause of universal regret among foreigners in Persia. 498. The decision to close down was the result of the financial difficulties of the parent company in Germany, whose creditors seem to have suddenly demanded that all unprofitable enterprises should be terminated forthwith. The situation came as a complete surprise to the German Legation and the acting manager, though Herr Weil may have known what was in the wind. The suddenness of the decision must have annoyed the Persian Government, who for once found them selves hoisted with their own petard, but the cessation of the service caused them little inconvenience, a civil air service having, in Teymourtache’s words, “a vanity value,” but little more, in present-day Persia. 499. Herr Weil himself returned to Tehran in August, this time as the representative of Luft Hansa. His object was to secure permission for Luft Hansa to operate a service between Bagdad and Tehran and perhaps between Tehran, Meshed and Kabul; they had no wish to run subsidiary services, but would do so if subsidised. For this purpose they would take over the aeroplanes in Tehran belonging to the Junkers company, which intended thenceforward to concentrate on aircraft construction. He complained to His Majesty’s Minister shortly after his arrival that Airwork (Limited) seemed determined to exclude him from operating in Iraq, and though he had every desire to co-operate he had no intention of being pushed aside. It appeared from subsequent enquiries that this was not Airwork’s intention ; their apparent opposition was a tactical move ** *- * 4[8706] h 4 designed to ensure that if Luft Hansa were allowed to land in Bagdad, they themselves should be allowed to land in Tehran. The tactics seemed a little clumsy for the object in view, Herr Weil being fundamentally well-disposed, but in a position to obstruct the plans of the British company in Persia. 500. The Persian Government had intimated earlier in the year that they ^vould not come to a decision about civil air services until October, but it was not ^®itil the end of December that Herr Weil came to an agreement with Teymour- tache, who was dismissed a day or two later. The Minister for Foreign Affairs assured Herr Weil that the agreement would stand, but the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs then expressed the intention of examining the agreement for himself, and his examination was not complete at the end of the year. Private Civil Flights. 501. There were some twenty-five private British flights over Persian territory during 1932, mostly along the coast of the Persian Gulf. The pilots included three Indians, one Japanese, one Frenchman and one pilot from the Irish Free State, all flying in machines registered in Great Britain. The most notable flight was probably that of Squadron Leader Hinkler. 502. A few planes flew to Tehran, but the projected visit of Miss Spooner, who with two other pilots proposed to fly three Members of Parliament to Tehran, did not take place. (B) Railways. 503. Early in the year a credit of 72,500,000 rials was voted for the improve ment of the lines already built, including the ports of Bandar Shah and Bandar Shahpur, as well as their extension northwards and southwards. A further 10 million rials were voted in November, immediately after the Shah’s visit to Ahwaz, for the extension of the southern section (see also the section entitled “ Railway Finance ”). 504. In the summer a Swiss engineer, M. Greenhut, was engaged as adviser on all railway questions. His relations with Mr. Carroll, who was unlikely to take kindly to such supervision, were the subject of some speculation, but the Persian Government seem to have been careful not to let the appointment affect Mr. Carroll’s position. 505. Considerable activity was shown in pushing on the northern section. Over 5,000 men were at work throughout most of the year, and parties were even busy upon the preliminary alignment at the top of the Firuz Kuh Pass. The work was mainly supervised by Swedish engineers, who seem at one time to have been dissatisfied with the lack of support given them by the Ministry of Communi cations; at any rate, they, offered their resignations in a body to the Shah, when he visited the railway in the summer, and the Acting Minister was said to have been severely reprimanded as a result. 506. In February, Mr. Carroll came to Tehran and was reported to have secured the Shah’s acquiescence in a scheme by which 500 million to 600 million rials would be placed at his disposal during the following five years, for the completion of the southern section as far as Burujird, or even Hamadan. At that time, he had thirty engineers and 7,000 men at work, and on his return to Ahwaz he announced his intention of raising this number to 20,000. The promised funds do not seem, however, to have materialised. The workmen never increased beyond 9,000, and later in the year considerable staff reductions took place, while Mr. Carroll, who went on leave for two or three months in the summer, returned without having made most of the purchases of railway material that he had intended. 507. Mr. Carroll seemed, none the less, to be still in high favour after the Shah’s visit to Khuzistan in November, judging by the eulogies that he received in the inspired Tehran press on the Monarch’s return. On this occasion, the Shah arrived at Bandar Shahpur from Bushire in one of his new warships, and travelled by rail to Ahwaz; his visit marked, to all intents and purposes, the formal opening of the port of Bandar Shahpur and the southern section of the railway. The estimates which Mr. Carroll gave the Shah of the cost of90 v extending the line to Khorreniabad or Burujird on the plateau are believed to have been greatly instrumental in deciding the Shah to find the money for this project by cancelling the Anglo-Persian Oil Company concession. 508. The Zahedan Railway is dealt with separately (see paragraphs 234 to 244 above). (C) Roads. ^ 509. Work on the Kerej-Chalus road has been hurried forward, and this route, linking Tehran with the Caspian, is nearing completion. Some 7,000 labourers were said to be working upon it, and no expense has been spared to complete it without delay. It crosses a pass 9,600 feet high, and will most certainly be closed from November to April, and require considerable repairs each spring. 510. The large concrete bridge over the Safid Rud on the road from Resht to Lahijan was carried away by the river in flood on the 10th March. This bridge is to be rebuilt. 511. Work is in progress to complete the Resht-Astara road. A fine wooden bridge has been built over the River Kasma, and a similar, but larger, bridge is nearing completion at Jumeh Bazaar. 512. The Bushire-Ahwaz road, via Kazerun and Behbehan, is nearing completion and is fit for motor traffic, though not yet bridged throughout. X 513. The construction of the Bushire-Lingah road has been commenced, and a large number of persons are at work on this new construction. 514. The Bushire-Shiraz road has been considerably improved and most of the danger points have been reconstructed. * •&gt; 515. Large credits have been made available for work on the Javanrud- Paveh-Avruman road and further construction on the Pusht-i-Kuh route (Shahabad (Harunabad)-J )eh Bala), which it is now intended to continue to Jdizful. The tunnel at the Renau range has been pierced. 516. Work upon the bridge over the Gamasiab, near Suleimanieh, on the Kermanshah-Harsin road, proceeds very slowly. 517. The Tabriz-Trebizond road is expected to be completed next autumn, and the work so far undertaken forecasts a first-class all-weather road. 518. The Rowanduz route connecting Tabriz with Mosul and Nisibin was opened to traffic, and during the autumn was regularly used by cars and light lorries. 519. Work on the Khabis-Kerman motor road, via the Sirch pass, is now in progress. 520. A start has been made on the realignment of the Zahedan-Birjand road, which will in future pass through Zabul (Sistan). The road will deviate from the present alignment at Shusp and rejoin at Hormuk, and, when it is ^ completed, the old direct road between Shusp and Hormuk will be allowed to fall into disrepair. Bridges will be built at Mohammedabad and Karbasik and over the Shiela, near Girdi Chah. ^ 7 IX. —Consular. i * (A) General. Status of Post. 521. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom having decided that it was no longer necessary for His Majesty’s Minister to continue to hold the post of His Majesty’s consul-general for Persia, the office of the consulate- general, Tehran, will in future be a consulate, and will be superintending to the vice-consulate at Resht.522.

Owing to the closure of His Majesty’s vice-consulate at Resht since the spring of the year, this work increased somewhat. Eight Greek passports were renewed, and a number of applicants for new passports were assisted towards completing and transmitting the necessary applications to the Greek consulate-general at Beirut. Consular Charge of Estonian Interests. 528. No consular services in this respect were performed. Subordinate Vice-Consulates. 529. Resht. —On the departure early in April of Mr. Vice-Consul Davis to Tabriz, the vice-consulate at Resht remained vacant until the end of the year. The vice-consulate munshi was left in charge of the property and archives, and referred any business that required attention to His Majesty’s consul at Tehran. The death of one British subject of European origin, Mr. John Paterson, an engineer in the service of a Persian bag-manufactuimg him, was lepoited as having occurred at Resht on the 25th October, 1932. 530. Hamadan. —His Majesty’s vice-consulate at Hamadan was definitely closed on the 8th April, the archives being transferred to His Majesty’s consulate at Kermanshah Various inadequate offers were received for the land and buildings but no sale has been effected. During the summer the vice-consulate house was let to a tenant from Bagdad. The ex-vice-consulate munshi has been provisionally retained on a reduced scale of pay as property agent, and a gardener is employed to look after the grounds. 531. Sultanabad. —Although this vice-consulate was not within the Tehran consular district, mention may here be made of the closing thereof on the 10th September. The archives have been deposited at His Majesty s consulate- general, Isfahan. Indian Government Pensions. 532 Consequent upon the closing of the Indo-European Telegraph Depait- ment in March 1931, a considerable increase resulted in the number of pensions mid bv His Majesty’s consul as Treasury officer to the Government of India. The pensions under this head now number fifty-three, of a value of approximately 28,000 rupees per annum.(B) Legislation. Marriage Law, September 24, 1931 (Mehr Mah 1, 1310). 533. Regulations drawn up by the Ministry of Justice under this law provide that no marriage can take place between a foreign man and a Persian woman without the authority of the competent Persian authority. The compet ent Persian authority in Persia is the Governor-General or Governor of the distr?^*^ in which the marriage is intended to take place, and, abroad, the Persian diplomatic or consular officer. A foreigner applying for permission to marry a Persian woman is required to produce— (a) A consular certificate of no impediment. {b) A satisfactory proof of means. {c) An undertaking that he intends to reside permanently in Persia. With regard to requirement (c), insistence thereon is, in practice, confined to cases where the foreigner is of the poorer working-class. Instructions were issued to His Majesty’s consular officers in Persia in the matter of the issue of no impediment certificates. Persian Nationality Law. 534. The failure of a few British subjects of European descent and of the majority of British-protected persons (principally from the Kurram Agency Territory) to take steps to renounce under supplementary article 1 the Persian nationality acquired by them under article 1 of the parent law, necessitated the extension of facilities for this purpose. Eventually representations by His Majesty’s Minister to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs resulted in a promise by the Persian Government to entertain c ‘ sympathetically ’ ’ applications under article 13 of the law by “ Persian subjects,” to be released from their Persian nationality for the purpose of “ acquiring ” a foreign nationality. Instructions were issued to His Majesty’s consular officers in Persia as to the procedure to be followed for the taking of declarations, and the issue of certificates, of British nationality to enable applicants to submit their petitions to the appropriate Persian authority. The matter was somewhat complicated by the fact that the Persian Government formulated objections to the use of the phrase ££ British- protected person,” as applied to certain categories of British nationals, especially in regard to that large colony of natives of the Kurram Agency Territory, and of the State of Jammu and Kashmir, who live in the Caspian provinces. It has now been decided, in the case of these natives, to call them respectively: (1) Nationals of the British Protected Territory of Kurram; (2) subjects of the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir. (C) Processes in the Courts against British Subjects. 535. The proceedings against Philip Penning appear to have faded away, as he has not served any sentence and is at large. It is understood that the Jew merchant whom he defrauded despaired of getting any pecuniary compensation out of Penning, and tired of paying court and other fees, has dropped any active part in prosecuting his case. 536. The case, referred to in paragraph 439 of the annual report for 1931, brought against Dr. V. St. George Vaughan, dragged its course, and on the 6th May the Shiraz Court of Appeal finally acquitted Dr. Vaughan of the charges of negligence brought against him. 537. Various Indian British subjects were prosecuted during the year for smuggling and cognate offences, mostly in East Persia. Narain Singh, a well- known seditionist, was one of these, and was brought to Tehran, where the proceedings were unfinished at the end of the year. The case of an Indian engine-driver, Moses Joseph, who was detained for over five months without being brought to trial on a charge of being responsible for a railway accident at Ahwaz, was the subject of vigorous representations to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 538. A British motor driver named Martin, who had killed a Kurdish boy on the Paitaq Pass, was detained at Kermanshah for about a month, but the public prosecutor finally decided not to bring a charge.93 1 I f , -T-' X.— Military Affairs. (A) Army. General. 539. The Shah continues to interest himself in every detail of army ^ministration. During His Majesty’s periodical tours throughout the length Wd breadth of Persia, the army is his chief concern. In consequence, the moral of the army is high. Training continues to improve and become more practical. Amongst the troops of the Central Garrison this reaches a much higher standard than in the provinces, but throughout the army training for war is carried out on a system, and in a manner which could scarcely have been hoped for four or five years ago. The cavalry and infantry are well equipped, but the artillery remains obsolete and out of date. The construction of new barracks is being undertaken on a large scale in Tehran and the provinces. An even stronger order than that of 1931 was issued forbidding all ranks of the army from having intercourse or social dealings with any type of foreigner. Organisation. 540. The Order of Battle of the Persian army has not altered noticeably, the only change of any importance being that the Asterabad Brigade has been abolished and the command reorganised into two units, the Asterabad Independent Regiment and the Turcoman Sahra Independent Regiment, the latter with headquarters at Gumbad-i-Kabus. 541. A new establishment, under the name of the Inspectorate-General of the Army, was formed at the Ministry of War. It is nominally subordinate to the Chief of Staff, and treated as a branch of the General Staff rather than a separate organisation. Amir Lashkar Amanulla Mirza, Jehanbani, on his return from a two years’ staff course in Paris, was appointed as the first Inspector-General, assisted by eight inspectors, as follows : Artillery, cavalry, aviation, armament and equipment, supply and transport, musketry and medical services. Estimates. 542. The budget allotment for the Ministry of War for the year 1932-33 was 181,689,980 rials. This amount was not sub-divided for the various services, but 160,179,980 rials are shown as a total for the upkeep of the Army, Air Force, arsenals, the travelling and study expenses of service students, and expenses connected with naval and military advisers. The sum of 21,500,000 rials was apportioned to the upkeep of the Amnieh (road guards or gendarmerie). In previous years the allotment for this latter force has been included in the budget of the Ministry of the Interior. The allotment for the Persian navy was not shown under the budget heading of the Ministry of War, but included in that of the Ministry of Finance, and details were not made available to show the exact sum allotted for this purpose. For the above reasons a comparison with last year’s figures is somewhat difficult, but approximately the total grants are the same, some 48 per cent, of the estimated national revenue. 543. On the 17th March the Majlis passed a Bill allowing a special grant of £1,500,000 from the Government reserves abroad to the Ministry of War for “completing the equipment of the army with modern material.” The second part of this same Bill stated that the 6 million tomans allotted for the same purpose in 1929-30 should be considered as the equivalent of £1,200,000. (B) Navy. 544. In 1932 the long expected naval force came into being and arrived in the Persian Gulf in October. It consists of six vessels, built in Italy, as follows :— (a) Two gunboats: Babr and Paldng of 950 tons displacement; {b) four patrol vessels : Karkas, Simorgh, Chabaaz and Sharock of 330 tons displacement. These ships left Italy in September and were inspected by the Shah on their arrival at Bushire in October. His Majesty travelled in one of these ships, escorted by the remainder, from Bushire to Bander Shahpui. 4 he force is undei the nominal command of Major Ghulam Ali Khan, Bayondar.94 (C) Air Force. 545. The past year has been one of preparation for expansion. Early in the year Captain Alis Nordquist, Swede, was engaged as air adviser to the Persian Government, and arrangements were made for the purchase of foreign aircraft. As far as is known at present arrangements have been made for the purchase of forty “Tiger Moths” from the De Haviland Company and thirty from tl^-^L^ Hawker Company, these latter to be fitted with 450 h.p. American Pratt ana Whitney “Hornet” engines. It is understood that ten aircraft, type R. 5, are also being obtained from the U.S.S.R. The “Tiger Moths ” will probably be used for instructional purposes at the new school for pilots, which is being instituted near Tehran. (D) Amnieh (Road Guards or Gendarmerie). 546. The annual allotment for the upkeep of this force was 21,500,000 rials, an increase of 1,490,000 rials over last year. The Amnieh continue to do most useful work throughout the country, but as they are employed in small scattered detachments their work is not spectacular. XI.— Miscellaneous. (A) Diplomatic and Consular Mails. Legation. 547. The conveyance of the Legation bag proved a source of considerable trouble throughout much of the year. Up till the end of March it continued to be carried by Junkers, and on the withdrawal of the company an arrangement was come to with the International Sleeping Car Company, who had just opened a motor-service for passengers between Tehran and Kirkuk, on the Iraq Railway; by this arrangement a seat in one of the company’s cars was placed at the courier’s disposal once a fortnight, this being much more economical than hiring a whole car. This arrangement was not, however, entirely satisfactory, especially as regards days of departure, and when the regular service closed down for the summer at the end of June the chance was taken to sign a contract with Mr. Mackie of the Trans-Persia Motor Service, who had carried the bags on previous occasions. This contract, which provides for a car service on the same lines as that with the International Sleeping Car Company, except that it continues throughout the year, has, so far, proved satisfactory. 548. Meanwhile, investigations had been proceeding into the possibility of acquiring for the Legation an aeroplane (probably a Puss Moth), which, flown by Royal Air Force pilots, could convey the Legation mails. The Foreign Office agreed to this in principle, and a comparison of costs showed a saving over the cheapest competitive method of conveying the bag, while it was at the same time obvious that the air service would have numerous advantages. This scheme was nevertheless not proceeded with during the year owing to the reluctance of His Majesty’s Minister to recommend its adoption until there was less uncertainty about the future of Junkers (or rather the Luft Hansa, which had superseded that company) and Airwork (Limited). 549. The parcels bag continued as before, the only difficulty being an increasing delay in the time taken for licences for parcels to reach the custom house from the General Department of Commerce. v Consular. 550. In March the system of consular couriers sanctioned by the Persian Government in principle in the previous May was at last put into operation, the Persian Legation at Bagdad and the consul-general at Delhi being empowered to grant couriers’ passports. In practice the new scheme only applied regularly to Kermanshah, which lay on the route between Tehran and Bagdad, but it was occasionally used to other consulates. In East Persia the old system of consular couriers continued to function without objection from the local authorities, and since it works well it is not proposed to introduce any change unless the Persian Government protest.551. On the closing down of Imperial Airways it became necessary'to consider what arrangements could be made for bags to Bushire, and the consul- general proposed that the previous system, by which the Persian post was used, with certain precautions, should be adopted. It was not, however, considered wise to entrust secret matter to this route, and the Legation proposed that the captains of British India steamers might, in case of need, be used as couriers. (B) Judicial Proceedings. His Majesty's Consxd at Kermanshah. 552. As foreshadowed in paragraph 539 of the annual report for 1931, Reuben Lalehzar did, in fact, appeal against the finding of the local court, and a notice was served on Mr. Hoyland, stating that the appeal would be heard at Ramadan on the 22nd September. Sanction was thereupon obtained from the Foreign Office for the engagement of a prominent Tehran lawyer to watch the proceedings on behalf of His Majesty’s consul on the lines laid down in paragraph 536 of the last annual report. This lawyer, Dr. Naficy, left for Ramadan as arranged on the 18th September, only to find that the Court of Appeal was in process of being moved to Kermanshah, and that it was therefore impossible for the hearing to be held. It having been ascertained from Mr. Hoyland that he had received no warning of this move, a protest against this discourtesy was addressed by His Majesty’s Minister to the Persian Government. By the end of the year no notice had been received of the date on which the post poned hearing of the appeal would be held. Sir Percy Sykes. 553. Nothing more was heard of the suit against Sir Percy Sykes (see paragraphs 540-541 of the annual report for 1931). (C) Flags. 554. Unfortunately, the policy of inactivity alluded to in paragraph 549 of last year’s report could not be continued, as early in February news was received from Zabul that the police there and at Zahedan had received instructions to remove the consular flags by force. A similar report was received from Bandar Abbas, and at Bushire the Governor asked, quite courteously, that the flagstaffs should not be used. His Majesty’s Minister at once protested strongly against the use of threats of this kind, but, in accordance with the Foreign Office ruling, it was decided to yield if the Persian Government insisted, and all consuls were instructed to make the necessary arrangements, the Minister for Foreign Affairs agreeing to give a period of grace in which poles could be erected on roofs, gate houses, &amp;c., and no interference would take place. The only other posts affected were Ramadan and Kermanshah. When His Majesty’s Minister explained that the necessary alterations at some posts might take longer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who throughout showed a most unfriendly spirit, declined to accept the consequences if they did. No incidents took place, however. 555. Various interesting details emerge from this brief history of events. 556. The original Persian demand appears to have been made at the instigation of the head of the Protocol Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, who based his theories on two notoriously unsund treatises on inter national law by French authors. 557. The Persian Government had up to the end of the year refrained from insisting that their original demand, that flags should only be flown on days of ceremony, be rigidly enforced, the only hint of interest being shown in Birjand. The Governor’s request was not, however, followed up. 558. In the course of the discussions it transpired that the Persian passport officer at Quetta flew a flag daily from a pole erected in his garden. It was decided not to press for the removal of this pole unless the Persian Government reverted to the question alluded to in the previous paragraph.559. No attempt was made by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to press the demand for the removal of flagstaffs in Embassies or Legations. 560. The flying of the White Ensign at Hen jam attracted the notice of the Persian Government, who asked that it should cease to fly, as there was no consulate there. They were given to understand that this was part of the status quo, and seem to have acquiesced, as no more was heard of their request. (D) Quarantine. 561. During 1932 Iraq was free from epidemics, and there were fewer outbreaks of ££ notifiable ” diseases in other neighbouring countries than in 1931; travellers were thus to a large extent spared the horrors of Persian quarantine stations. 562. The British representative on the International Sanitary Commission continued to make private representations to the Persian representative, and the appointment in the spring of a French health adviser to the Persian Government, General Coulogner, would, it was hoped, lead to an improvement in sanitary conditions throughout Persia. This officer has so far spent most of his time on tours of inspection, which cannot fail to open his eyes. 563. In August an outbreak of cholera in British Baluchistan led to the imposition of quarantine at Mirjawa, and the inevitable complaints against the revolting conditions soon started to flow in. The slightly guilty attitude of the Health authorities, when these were brought to their notice, may perhaps be taken as an indication of better things in the future, and certainly immediate steps were taken to remedy the worst causes of offence. This quarantine was of comparatively short duration. In November a tax of 9 rials per head was imposed at Mirjawa on travellers in both directions to provide funds for a quarantine station. (E) Sir Aurel Stein. 564. Sir Aurel Stein arrived in Persian Mekran, as planned, early in January (see paragraph 553 of last year’s report), and undertook his exploration of ancient sites in that region. The Persian Government had apparently agreed to this investigation, but they soon raised the objection that Sir Aurel was “surveying,” and requested that this be put a stop to. It transpired that Sir Aurel had indeed conducted a running plane table survey of his route, which was indispensable, owing to the inadequacy of the existing maps, if the position of his sites was to be accurately recorded, and after some discussion the Persian Government were induced to see his point of view and permit this limited amount of map-making. 565. A further difficulty arose when Sir Aurel endeavoured to send his “finds” (which consisted of many thousand small fragments of shards, &amp;c.) out of Persia via Bushire. However, it ultimately proved possible to appease the thirst for formalities of the customs authorities and the Ministry of Education, and the cases, with the “finds,” were despatched. 566. During the summer Sir Aurel’s Indian surveyor made preliminary investigations in the neighbourhood of Kerman, plotting routes by plane table. 567. In October Sir Aurel returned to Persia, this time via Tehran, where he visited all the officials concerned, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Chief of General Staff, Minister of War and Minister of Education. He was assured that all arrangements had been made for his winter’s work, that an escort had been provided and that no objections would be raised to his surveying his route and making trial excavations. No sooner had he commenced his labours, however, than the officer commanding the escort impounded his maps, refused to allow more than the merest scratches to be made in the ground at any possible site, and became generally obstructive.97 o 568. It should be explained that it had been intended that Sir Aurel should be accompanied by an Inspector of the Antiquities Section of the Ministry of Education, but the director of the section, M. Godard, a Frenchman, whose amiability is only equalled by his vagueness, was in Isfahan at the time and had done nothing about the matter. , 569. On receipt of this news, steps were taken to have urgent instructions it to the local authorities not to interfere with Sir Aurel’s work, and arrange ments were made for a local representative of the Ministry of Education at Kerman to be attached to the party, pending the arrival of M. Godard’s expert. It is to be hoped that these arrangements will remove all difficulties. 570. Throughout the “affaire Stein,” the Persian authorities, notably the head of the English section of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Ghaffar Khan Jelal, proved themselves notably helpful, and the difficulties experienced by Sir Aurel may be attributed to sheer muddleheadedness combined with the terror, common to all subordinates in Persia, of permitting anything not explicitly and fully covered by written instructions; it must also be admitted that Sir Aurel, whose activity is remarkable, probably outdistanced on many occasions the instructions that might have smoothed his path.7460 [10152] B THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT Printed for the use of the Foreign Office.

THE achievement of the year has been the settlement of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company dispute, and the outstanding fact has been that, with the disappearance of Teymourtache, there is no transmuter of the electric force emanating from the Imperial dynamo. The Shah now issues orders which no one dares question or bowdlerise, and the result is that, as these orders are sometimes issued when he is—to quote his Minister for Foreign Affairs—too angry to think, a great fear haunts the capital. To make matters worse, there is every reason to think that the Shah himself is haunted by the fear that he is in the grip of cancer, and that if he came to die, neither the work which he has undertaken for the modernisation of Persia nor even his upstart dynasty would survive. And so we have witnessed feverish activity on the railway, a continued expansion of the armed forces, the death or arrest of Teymourtache and other “ tall poppies,” a neurotic regard for prestige in foreign relations, all symptoms of a mind tortured by doubts and fears for the future, and of an iron, if ill- directed, determination to secure the future even against the hand of death. It is just possible he has a friend or someone he trusts among the General Staff, but of army matters we know nothing. The universal impression is that he confides in nobody, and that the suspiciousness on which Teymourtache once dilated to Sir It. Clive has become a disease. None the less, all foreigners wdio have at rare intervals access to him are invariably impressed by his quickness of apprehension and by his readiness to listen to reasonable arguments. Unfortunately, his mood seems to change almost as soon as the foreigner has withdrawn. 2. A curious fact is that, in spite of the suspension of the Anglo-Persian treaty negotiations throughout the year, and although relations have twice been acutely strained, there has been no renewal of the Persian demand for our evacuation of Henjam, nor have the Persian Government made any attempt to drag Bahrein into the limelight; they have, in fact, neglected the two most obvious points of attack. 3. Another outstanding feature of the year was the stubborn attitude maintained towards the Soviet Government both in commercial matters and in the severity of the measures taken against Soviet propaganda. These measures were partly responsible for the steadily increasing timidity displayed by Persians, who normally frequent foreign society, in visiting foreign Legations. Officially, no orders have been issued, but the general impression is that it is safer to keep away, and this has reached such a point that the English wife of a senior officer is afraid to come to the British Legation. 4. Generally speaking, the year has been marked by a sense of uneasy expectation both in foreign and internal affairs. People are wondering what will happen here when, in the spring, the Shah pays his official visits to Iraq, a country with which he desires to settle a number of important questions, and Turkey, and then goes on to Switzerland to see his son and to consult specialists, and they are asking what will happen next if the verdict of the specialists is unfavourable; will the few people of prominence left in the country be sent to join the Minister of War and others in prison, and will there be an upheaval? Many Persians hold that upheavals do not occur in this apathetic land without a push from abroad, and they would therefore presumably argue that nothing dramatic would occur unless the Soviet Government had decided on a forward policy. II.— Foreign Relations. (A) British Empire. United Kingdom. 5. Twice in the course of 1933 Anglo-Persian relations appeared to the optimistic observer to have reached a point of cordiality which justified a hope that the protracted treaty negotiations might be finally concluded early in 1934, and twice they were strained almost to breaking-point. At the end of the year they were more or less normal, if uneasily so. [10152] 24 6. When the year opened the oil dispute still lay like a cloud over Anglo- Persian relations. But the first excitement caused by the cancellation of the D’Arcy Concession had died down, and though the road to a settlement looked long and tortuous, no one now supposed that the dispute would end in a rupture. Moreover, visits paid by H.M.S. Hawkins to Abadan at the New Year and to Bushire a week later (both of which had been arranged before the cancellation took place) had led to the establishment of cordial relations with the Persian navy and had gone far towards restoring a normal atmosphere. 7. The steps which led to the oil agreement of the 30th April are described elsewhere. Once that agreement was signed, the way was clear for the restora tion of complete harmony, the need for which was recognised on both sides. On the 19th February, while the oil dispute was still unsettled, His Majesty’s Minister had been received in audience by the Shah on the occasion of the departure of Lieutenant-Colonel P. C. R. Dodd, the military attache. The Shah spoke at length on this occasion on the subject of good relations. It was, he said, clearly in the interest of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom that Persia should be stable, independent and strong under a patriotic Government, while the Persian Government, for their part, had no desire to pick a quarrel, as was proved by their attitude to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company since the cancellation. Yet he feared that His Majesty’s Government viewed askance such a Persia as he had described, and that their feelings were unfriendly. His Majesty’s Minister assured the Shah that such suspicions were totally unfounded and that His Majesty’s Government realised as well as His Imperial Majesty where their interests lay. 8. The remarks of the Shah were probably due to recent references to Persia and himself in British newspapers. On the 7th January the British- owned Bagdad Times had reproduced a paragraph from the Evening Standard stating that it was Teymourtache who had taught the Shah to play poker and use a toothpick. At the same time the press in London were describing the preponderant role played by Teymourtache before his fall and wondering how Persia would get on without him. These articles, and particularly one in the Times of the 9th January about “ dropping the pilot,” are known to have made the Shah furious, but he may have discounted them as the natural outcome of the oil dispute, for, though violent representations were made in Bagdad about the “ poker and toothpick ” article, no protest was made to His Majesty’s Government. Subsequent events showed that the Shah firmly believed all such articles to be officially inspired, and it is interesting, in the light of these events, that at the audience in February the Shah professed to regard press criticism with disdain, adding that all persons in prominent positions must expect occasionally to be the butt of ill-natured or ill-informed satire. 9. During the months preceding the oil settlement the Shah, in spite of his anger at the press articles, completed an order for British aeroplanes and cleared the ground for further orders. He also placed extensive orders for spinning-mill machinery with a British firm. The Persian Government at the same time made enquiries respecting the possibility of Persian naval cadets being trained in the United Kingdom, and they gave permission without any hesitation for visits by H.M.S. Enterprise to Bushire, Abadan and Hen jam, to take place in May. 10. Directly the oil agreement had been signed, His Majesty’s Minister suggested that as soon as Sir John Cadman reached London he should be received by the King and give His Majesty a first-hand account of the negotia tions which he had conducted in Tehran, and that this audience should be followed by the despatch of a personal message from the King to the Shah expressing His Majesty s pleasure at the successful conclusion of the negotiations. The message might, he went on to suggest, add that while he himself was on leave during the summer he would receive full instructions regarding the general treaty, so that on his return to Tehran in the autumn the negotiations could be brought to a rapid conclusion, and that the King counted upon the Shah’s personal help if any difficulties arose. 11. This suggestion was accepted in principle, and as soon as Sir John Cadman had been received in audience and the Oil Agreement had been ratifiedby the Majlis, His Majesty s Minister was authorised to deliver a message in the following terms :— ‘ ‘ I have learnt with pleasure of the successful conclusion of the negotiations recently held in Tehran between your Majesty’s Government and the representatives of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and I have just received in audience Sir John Cadman, who has given me a personal account of his conversations with your Majesty. “ His report of the views expressed by your Majesty on the subject of the relations between our two countries has given me keen satisfaction, as they are in harmony with my own views and with those of my Government in the United Kingdom. Advantage will be taken by my Government of the presence in England in the near future on leave of absence of my Minister accredited to your Majesty to review the previous discussions for the conclusion of a general settlement of outstanding questions, in the hope that it may be possible for these discussions to be resumed in the autumn on the return of Mr. Hoare to your Majesty’s Court with the best prospect of a successful issue. I feel confident that your Majesty’s personal help and guidance will on that occasion also be available to remove any difficulties which might arise.” 12. This message was delivered at an audience on the morning of the 3rd June, at which Mr. V. A. L. Mallet, who was to act as Charg6 d’Affaires during the summer, was also present. The Shah expressed keen pleasure at its terms, and said that, though the conduct of His Majesty’s Government during the past few years had at times led him to doubt whether they were in earnest in their professions of friendship, he had put these doubts behind him and was convinced that with the settlement of the oil dispute both countries could look forward to an epoch of friendly co-operation. 13. The Shah’s reply to the Royal message, which was communicated to His Majesty’s Minister by the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the King’s birthday reception, was couched in the following terms :— “ I have received with great pleasure your Majesty’s friendly message, which has been communicated to me by his Excellency Mr. Hoare. The fact that your Majesty and your Government are in accord with my views in regard to the relations of our two countries has been especially gratifying to me, and I am happy to learn that the misunderstandings which had erroneously arisen with regard to my motives and those of my Government have been removed. The happy ending of the negotiations between my Government and the representatives of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is a good proof of the real sentiments entertained here towards your Majesty’s country. [Note. —This could alternatively mean: ‘ Has made clear to the people of your country the real nature of our sentiments.’] “ Your Majesty can rest assured that my enduring aim, as well as that of my Government, is to maintain the friendly and sincere relations which exist between our two countries. Cherishing the hope that your Majesty’s Government will always have in mind the rights and the legitimate interests of Persia, as far as in me lies, I shall use my endeavours to settle the outstanding questions.” During the audience the Shah had expressed the hope that His Majesty’s Minister might be able to deliver this reply in person on his arrival in London. His Majesty’s Minister, who had been promoted in the birthday honours list to be a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George, left for London the same evening. 14. The mention of the King’s birthday reception affords an opportunity for a digression upon the relations of His Majesty’s Legation with non-official Persians. There is good reason to believe that at the very end of 1932 the Shah had issued fresh orders rendering even stricter than before the ban upon social intercourse between Persians, whether official or non-official, and foreign missions. The official explanation of these and previous orders has sometimes been that the orders do not exist at all, and that anyone with reasonable cause for doing so is perfectly free to frequent foreign society; sometimes that the [10152] B 36 19. There were, of course, many other difficulties, but difficulties are endemic in Persia, and after the release of Mr. Townshend-Smith His Majesty’s orders are rendered inevitable by the need for keeping Persians from consorting with the Soviet Embassy, and by the impossibility of making distinctions between one foreign mission and another. At any rate, whether the persons concerned were obeying orders or merely making intelligent guesses about the Shah’s opinions, there can be no doubt that during the opening months of 1933 scarcely any Persian who was not either high up in the Administration or else a ^ member of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs felt able to accept invitations to foreign houses. 15. The immediate occasion for these orders is not entirely clear, though it probably had some connexion with Teymourtache, apprehension as to what his relations with Soviet Embassy might have been, and even greater apprehension as to what the foreign colonies generally might be saying about his downfall But it is almost certain that there had also existed at one time a lively fear of what His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom might do as a result of the oil dispute, and that this engendered a deep suspicion of all things British, which outlasted the motive from which it arose. this suspicion manifested itself in many ways, but particularly in the difficulties placed in the way of the innocent wanderings of Sir Aurel Stein in South Persia, and the sudden cessation in February of all intercourse between His Majesty’s consulate at Shiraz and local Persian society, Shiraz having been until then the one town in Persia where social contacts could still be freely made. Then came the arrest of a Persian named Rashidi, who had for the last twenty years paid regular visits to the oriental secretary of the day in order to retail the gossip of the bazaars. There can be no doubt that Rashidi (who was still in prison at the end of the year) was arrested because of these visits, although this has been strenuously denied by every Persian official, except the chief of police, with whom the question has been discussed. The arrests of Mr. Townshend-Smith and Mr. Parsons, mentioned below, were probably the outcome of the same state of mind. 16. The conclusion of the oil agreement, however, completely changed the atmosphere, and, at the King’s birthday reception, an unusually large number of Persians were present, despite the fact that the reception was held at Gulhek. Thereafter, although it cannot be said that anything like free social intercourse existed between Persians and foreigners, the position was at least no worse than it had been during the past three or four years, and there it remained until the Bakhtiari arrests in November once against created an atmosphere of panic. 17. When His Majesty’s Minister asked for the audience which took place on the 3rd June, only two major questions, apart from those connected with the general treaty, were outstanding. Of these two questions, both of which are dealt with in greater detail elsewhere, the first was an announcement by the Minister of Finance that the Imperial Bank of Persia would not in future receive the customs franchise to which their concession entitled them. His Majesty’s Minister told the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he intended at need to raise the question with the Shah; this sufficed to convince the Minister of the bad impression which such an announcement, made while the ink on the Oil Agreement was still wet, was bound to produce on His Majesty’s Government, and it was withdrawn the day before the audience. 18. The second question was the arrest of two British subjects, Mr. Townshend-Smith and Mr. Parsons, on charges of espionage. Soon after the audience the Minister for Foreign Affairs told His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that, in the interests of good relations, he desired to dispose of these two cases in a friendly manner. That of Mr. Parsons was simple, since no evidence had been found to support the charge, and Mr. Parsons, who was already on bail, would not be prosecuted. That of Mr. Townshend-Smith was more difficult, since, he alleged, ample evidence for a conviction existed; but, in view of the damage that a trial would do to Anglo-Persian relations, he would not be tried, but deported. Mr. Townshend-Smith was subsequently set at liberty, though the threat of expulsion remained hanging over his head until the end of the year.Legation had every reason to look forward to a quiet and, by Tehran standards, uneventful summer. 20. These dreams were, however, rudely shattered when Major Bayendor, the commandant of the Persian navy, hauled down the Union Jack at Basidu on the 31st July. The story of the Basidu incidents is told in a separate section, and it is only necessary to state here that, from the outset, the Shah and the Persian Government repudiated the action of the commandant and gave assurances against the repetition of such incidents. Some difficulty was, however, experienced in inducing them to commit this repudiation to paper, and, in the meanwhile, the First Flotilla destroyer was sent to the Persian Gulf to restore confidence on the Arab coast. When the Persian note was eventualty received it was vague and unsatisfactory. This necessitated further correspondence, during which the trouble was aggravated by the appearance in the British press of reports that the Persian Government had “ apologised,” the mere idea of an apology being sufficient to throw the Shah into one of the rages to which His Majesty’s Legation were soon to become accustomed. 21. The flag incident was still unsettled when an even more serious crisis arose over the arrest at Basidu on the 9th October of the Persian mudir of customs, who had examined a dhow lying off the British area. This arrest was carried out by the officer in charge of the guard which had been landed immediately after the flag incident, and the mudir was eventually conveyed to Bandar Abbas in one of His Majesty’s sloops. 22. Whether the mudir deserved arrest or not, there can be no doubt that, in view of the uncertainty attaching to the British position at Basidu, his arrest proved most impolitic, and placed His Majesty’s Government on the defensive where they had previously held the initiative. His Majesty’s Charge dAffaires was able to deliver a note to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs complaining of the incursion of the mudir into the British area before the Persian Government had heard of the incident, but they quickly retaliated with a vigorous counter protest denying that His Majesty’s Government possessed any rights at Basidu at all. A violent press campaign followed, and a debate was staged in the Majlis. The Persian Government also vented their annoyance in a series of insolent notes in reply to complaints by His Majesty’s Government regarding the conduct of the Persian navy, which would otherwise have certainly been dealt with in a more friendly manner. These complaints related mainly to the searching of Koweiti dhows’ on the high seas, a subject which His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires had at one time almost persuaded the Persian Government to settle satisfactorily in order to end the flag incident. They also included unauthorised visits by a Persian warship to the island of Tamb and a Persian customs launch to Khasab, in Muscat territory. In these notes the Persian Government denied the right of His Majesty’s Government to speak for the Arab principalities, and questioned the interpretation of the status quo agreement. As a final mark of their annoyance, the Persian Government withheld permission for visits by H.M.S. Hawkins to Henjam, Bushire and Abadan, on the ground that these visits were inopportune at such a juncture. Later, however, they consented under pressure to allow unofficial visits to Abadan and Henjam. 23. When the first wave of emotion had passed, the Persian Government concentrated on an attempt to extract from His Majesty’s Government a disavowal of the action of the officer in charge of the guard, similar, they maintained, to their own disavowal of Major Bayendor. Failing this, they were prepared to submit the status of Basidu to an international tribunal, and they indicated that, unless they received some ‘ ‘ compensation ’ ’ for the mudir incident, they would do so. &gt; 24. While His Majesty’s Government were not prepared to go so far as this, they authorised His Majesty’s Minister shortly after his return to Tehran on the 19th November to inform the Persian Government that they were still ready to surrender their rights at Basidu in the general treaty, and that they thought the best way of settling the present diifficulties was to push on with the treaty; in the meanwhile, relying upon the assurances given by the Persian Government, they would withdraw the naval guard from Basidu, although the [10152] * 48 flag would continue to fly there. His Majesty’s Minister was to add that His Majesty’s Government had been obliged to issue their original instructions for the conveyance of the mudir to Bandar Abbas upon telegraphic reports ; that the fuller reports since received had convinced them that their interpretation of the status quo would have been equally well vindicated by the return of the mudir to his post; and that they had never had any intention of humiliating a friendly Government. 25. But before this message could be delivered, and while Anglo-Persian relations already seemed as bad as they could be, news reached Tehran of the appearance in the “Londoner’s Diary’’ of the Evening Standard in November of a paragraph declaring that the “strong but eccentric ruler of Persia was becoming increasingly addicted to opium and therefore unable to make the quick decisions of his early days, and stating that a restoration of the “ legitimate line ” was being keenly discussed both in Tehran and Paris, where the former Shah’s brother lived in much magnificence. This paragraph opened with a statement to the effect that the story emanated from opponents of the present Shah, but in order to dispose of the story even more effectually the Foreign Office had at once persuaded the Evening Standard to publish a further paragraph emphasising the tainted source of the reports and adding that these reports found no echo whatsoever in Persia itself, “where Reza sits firmly in the saddle.” Unfortunately, this paragraph, of which the Foreign Office had merely suggested the general sense, again used the word “legitimate” to describe the former dynasty, and this word proved later to have rendered the whole paragraph valueless in the eyes of the Shah. The fact that the paragraphs were reproduced in the Indian press added fuel to the flames. 26. In any case, when His Majesty’s Minister delivered the Basidu message to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 29th November he found the latter, who had just returned from seeing the Shah at the Turcoman races, in a state of despair. The Shah was in an ungovernable fury bordering on madness, and had caused instructions to be sent to the Persian Charge d’Affaires in London to tell His Majesty’s Government that unless satisfaction were given for the paragraphs in the Evening Standard, diplomatic relations would be suspended. The Minister for Foreign Affairs made no attempt to argue when His Majesty’s Minister told him that such conduct must inevitably lead His Majesty’s Government to conclude that Persia treated her relations with Great Britain with utter levity and that it was useless to deal with a man who changed his mind so violently over the merest trivialities. But he begged His Majesty’s Minister to help him meet the storm. The latter suggested that the message he had just delivered should calm the Shah’s anger, but the Minister thought it would be quite ineffective in the Shah’s present state of mind. He then enquired whether action could not be taken against the editor, but was told that administrative action was out of the question, and that while a prosecution might conceivably be possible the outcome would be exceedingly dubious and would in any case defeat its own ends by attracting immense publicity to a statement which would otherwise pass unnoticed. 27. His Majesty’s Minister saw the Prime Minister later in the day. He made some attempt to justify the Shah’s anger on the ground that this and previous press attacks indicated the existence of some clique that wished ill to Persia and caused doubt as to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government. His Majesty's Minister retorted that if such a clique existed outside the realms of imagination, the Shah was playing straight into their hands. As for the attitude of His Majesty’s Government, this was clearly shown in the message he had just given to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. 28. Upon returning from this interview His Majesty’s Minister found a telegram informing him of the appearance in the Times of the 28th November of an article on Persia by Mr. C. de Bathe, who had just left Tehran after two years as the 1 imes correspondent in Persia. This article commented on the artificial nature of Persian nationalism, the small number of Persian patriots, who are not to be found in the chief places of the present Government,” and the licence accorded to army and police officers as proteges of the Shah. It then gave an account of the “jockey incident” recorded in paragraph 404, and went on to say that the result of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company dispute had seriously damaged the position of foreigners in Persia. The article concluded with9 references to the discontent of the tribes, the closely-guarded life of the Shah hnd the efforts of his advisers to keep from him their own failures in administration and the failure of the army against the tribesmen. Although this article con tained elements of truth, it is permissible to conclude from its style that it was written by Mr. de Bathe in a fit of resentment at certain incidents in which he became involved, largely through his own fault, while in Persia. 29. The Persian Charge d’Affaires, with singular courage, contented himself with telegraphing that an article which contained certain misleading statements had appeared in the Times and that he had published a suitable rejoinder (this rejoinder, in the form of a letter to the editor, appeared in the Times on the 30th November and was followed by the publication on the 7th December of a letter on similar lines from Sir John Cadman). The delay achieved its object, inasmuch as the precise terms of the article did not reach Tehran until the Shah’s anger had had time to cool a little. Moreover, when the Times of the 28th November eventually arrived on about the 10th December, it did so simultaneously with copies of the Daily Telegraph of the same date, containing, by a fortunate coincidence, a eulogistic article upon Persia by Mr. Merton, their Cairo correspondent, who had visited Persia in May and had been received by the Shah. 30. The Daily Telegraph article was reproduced in full in most of the Tehran newspapers, some mild criticism, to the effect that Persia pursued a policy of friendship with all her neighbours, being directed against the concluding sentences, which stated in too unequivocal a manner that Great Britain and Persia should stand shoulder to shoulder against a common foe from the north. It did much to counter the torrent of abuse in which these newspapers indulged against the Times in general and Mr. de Bathe in particular. For obvious reasons the press was not allowed to make any mention of the Evening Standard paragraphs, while the anti-Times fulminations omitted all reference to the jockey incident. No attempt was made to attribute the inspiration of the Times article to His Majesty’s Government. 31. Meanwhile, the Persian Charge d’Affaires had seen Sir Robert Vansittart, in the absence of the Secretary of State, on the 2nd December, and had delivered the message from his Government threatening to break off relations. He added that his Government could not accept the excuse that the press was free from official control, as they knew that articles like that in the Evening Standard were not published without due care and consideration. Sir Robert Vansittart replied that to remonstrate with the editor of the Evening Standard would only make matters worse, and that an action in the courts would have the same effect, even if one were possible. The Shah’s best course was to treat contemptible press articles as too contemptible to be noticed, but, nevertheless, if the Persian Govern ment wished him to do so in spite of his advice, he would be willing to summon the editor and take him to task. He wished it to be clearly understood, however, that his action would be taken out of friendship for Persia and not as a result of the threat to break off relations. Moreover, he was unable to accept the Persian statement that the freedom of the press could not be accepted as an ‘‘ excuse.” The freedom of the press in democratic countries was a fact and not a theory. 32. The Charge d’Affaires then raised the question of the Times article, and was told by Sir Robert Vansittart that this case was different; the Times was a respectable newspaper, and he was prepared to inform the editor of the feeling which this article had aroused and ask him to prevent the publication of similar articles in future. (The editor was spoken to in this sense some days later.) 33. On the 2nd December also His Majesty’s Minister saw the Minister for Foreign Affairs and handed him a personal letter, which he said he hoped his Excellency would show the Shah, recapitulating and expanding the arguments already used by Sir Robert Vansittart and by himself, and expressing regret at the appearance of a scurrilous libel upon the Sovereign of a friendly country. He also offered to write a personal letter to the Shah on the same lines if the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs thought this would ease the situation, but they later decided that such a course would be somewhat unusual. In the same interview it was agreed that the mudir question should be left alone for the time being.34. At another interview on the 5th December the Minister for Foreign Affairs asked whether some action other than the prosecution of the editor could not be taken, such as a complimentary reference to the Shah in Parliament or a leading article in the Tivies. He was told that the threat to break off relations made it difficult to consider any such suggestions. His Majesty’s Minister had already, as a matter of fact, enquired about the possibility of a pronouncement in the House of Lords, and he now suggested to the Foreign Office that if no action on these lines was possible, he should address an official note to the Persian Government, stating once more the arguments against taking action, and adding that it was their concern for the Shah’s dignity which caused His Majesty’s Government to hold such strong views on this subject. The Foreign Office preferred, however, to make no further communication at that stage. 35. The Shah returned to Tehran on the 8th December. In anticipation of this event His Majesty’s Minister had sent the Minister for Foreign Affairs another private letter suggesting additional arguments which might help him to face his master with a true account of the position. Four days later the Shah listened patiently to an exposition of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government. At a second meeting he virtually expressed himself as satisfied, and readily agreed to receive His Majesty’s Minister with a view to the termination of the incident. 36. After this Basidu again took the centre of the stage, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, when informing His Majesty’s Minister that the audience would take place on the 18th December (later changed to the 19th December), asked that the message of the 29th November should be communicated in writing. This was done, but the letter did not satisfy him, as His Majesty’s Minister had only been given authority to deliver the first part of the message in writing. The part of the message to which the Persian Government attached importance was the second part, which gave the explanation that His Majesty’s Government would not have sent the mudir to Bandar Abbas had they then had before them the fuller reports which they received later, and that his arrest was not intended as a humiliation. The Minister for Foreign Affairs eventually agreed, however, to leave the question over until after the audience. 37. The audience itself, at which Major D. G. Pybus, the new military attache, was presented, was a complete success. The Shah scarcely mentioned the press articles, and said that the mudir incident could be closed if His Majesty’s Minister would write in a note all that he had told the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 29th November. He agreed, after a little argument, that this note need not be published, and that, so far as the Majlis was concerned, a simple statement that the incident was closed would be sufficient. 38. The Shah had already stated that an early resumption of treaty negotiations was most desirable. He now went on to say that he was anxious that the most friendly feelings should prevail between the British and Persian navies, and had decided as a proof of his sentiments to send his fleet on a visit to various Indian ports. At the suggestion of His Majesty’s Minister, he agreed that the commandant of the Persian navy should have a frank discussion with the Political Resident about some of the activities of the Persian navy which were causing uneasiness to British officials. 39. The Shah then announced that an order for merchant vessels would almost ceitainly be placed with British yards) this was a sign of his friendly feelings, just as his desiie for a treaty was, but it must not be supposed for a moment that Persia needed anyone’s friendship. 40 In conversation with Major Pybus the Shah intimated that he had it m mind to send a military attache to London. 41 ' J 11 ,® no . te about the mudir incident for which the Shah had asked was sent to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the form which he desired on the 28th December, and, though the official acknowledgment was not received till after the new year, its despatch restored normal relations for the first time since the 31st July.India. 42. In March the Governor of Madras issued orders that the Criminal Tribes Act should not be applied in future to the vagrant tribes known generally as “ Iranis.” In this way one of the few remaining grievances of the Persian Government which have any solid foundation was removed. 43. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Persian consulate-general in Delhi made representations from time to time about the slowness of the Municipality of Bombay in paying the compensation which had been awarded to certain Persian subjects who had suffered in the riots of 1931. 44. The attitude of local authorities in Persia to Indian residents gave rise to numerous complaints and much anxiety during the year. The worst offenders were the authorities in East Persia and Khuzistan. 45. The most common form of complaint concerned the application of the Foreigners’ Residence Law of June 1931. This law gives the police complete discretion as to the period of validity of the residence permits which they grant, and in many parts, and especially in Khorassan, the police used this discretion as a means of harassing British Indian subjects. They would call upon them to apply for re-registration three or four times in a year, the registration fees, which are quite heavy for persons in humble circumstances, being levied on each occasion, and fines being levied on those who failed to appear in person at the proper date, even though they might live at a great distance from the headquarters of the province. 46. Apart from the question of residence permits, the Customs authorities at Zahedan gave much trouble to Indian traders, high-handed action involving breaches of the safeguards being taken on more than one occasion. The authorities in Khuzistan, on the other hand, seem to have specialised in the creation of difficulties for Indian doctors, of whom there are a number in the province, and for Indian employees on the railway. The difficulties in Khuzistan were largely due to a venal chief of police, whose conduct was the subject of an enquiry by military officers in the summer. 47. The Iran-i-Bostan, an illustrated newspaper of pronounced Nationalist views, was started in January. The editor, Saif-i-Azad, was formerly the organiser of a Tehran society formed to promote close relations with Parsees in India. The editor started off by paying special attention to India, but later transferred his allegiance to the Nazi movement in Germany, even adopting a swastika as part of his title-page. (B) Iraq. General. 48. Few of the questions at issue between Persia and Iraq came any nearer to solution during 1933, and many incidents calculated to embitter feeling on both sides took place. Yet it cannot be said that Perso-Iraqi relations were at any time really strained. 49. From time to time guesses were made as to the date which the Shah would choose for the visit which King Feisal had invited him to pay to Bagdad, but it was not until the autumn that the Shah asked King Ghazi whether the spring of 1934 would be convenient and received a reply welcoming the suggestion. 50. The death of King Feisal was followed by suitable expressions of regret by the Persian Government, Majlis and press, but it is doubtful whether much genuine public interest was aroused. Probably the Shah, whose greatest fear is that he himself may die before his work is finished, was more deeply affected than any of his subjects. 51. In September the Persian Minister at Bagdad, Mirza Seyyid Bagher Khan Kazemi, became Minister for Foreign Affairs. Bagdad Times. 52. On the 7th January the British Bagdad Times published a paragraph to the effect that it was Teymourtache who had taught the Shah to play poker,12 eat with a fork and use a toothpick. All three statements were foolish, while the first at any rate would probably be truer if the supposed roles of pupil and teacher were reversed. The Persian Government took energetic action at Bagdad with the result that the newspaper was suspended for fourteen days, in spite of the fact that the editor had published an apology. The statements had originally appeared in the Evening Standard of the 1st and 2nd January, and, though the Persian Government did not complain about this to His Majesty’s Government at the time, it may have increased the force of the explosion which occurred later over the “ Qajar restoration ” paragraphs in the same newspaper. Jafar Sultan and the A woman Rebellion. 53. The Persian Government were involved in operations in Kurdistan, and particularly in the Avroman district, during most of the year, and, although the situation was never really dangerous, the amount of opposition encountered was sufficient to make the Persian authorities ascribe their difficulties to influences outside their own country. 54. In February the Persian Charge d’Affaires mentioned, in the course of an unofficial conversation at the Foreign Office, that among certain circles in Persia there was a tendency, which he himself knew to be absurd, to regard His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom as somehow responsible for the activities of Jafar Sultan in Persian territory. At about the same time the Persian press accused the Iraqi Government of having released Jafar Sultan from internment and thereby enabled him to create mischief in Persia. The whole question was apparently bound up in their eyes with British resentment at the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s concession. The Persian Minister in Bagdad also made strong representations. 55. As it happened, Jafar Sultan was quite blameless, having been under supervision at either Mosul or Hillah throughout the troubles. A certain colour was, however, given to the story by the fact that his nephew, Afrasiab Beg, who had never been in Iraq at all, and two of his sons, over whom the old man had no control whatsoever, were among the leading insurgents. This mistake was later, admitted by the Persian press, who swept it aside as an irrelevant point of detail. 56. The Iraqi Government undertook, however, to close their frontier to refugee rebels and to prevent Iraq from being used as a base of operations against Persian troops. For this purpose a battalion of infantry was specially stationed along this part of the frontier. The Iraqi Government also compelled Jafar Sultan to write to Afrasiab Beg telling him to desist from fighting, but the letter had no effect. In fact these measures laid them open to charges of undue subservience to Persian interests from their own subjects near the frontier. 57 In April a party of Persian troops entered Iraqi territory near Kowela apparently in ignorance. The matter was settled by the Persian and Iraqi frontier commissioners, and the Persian troops withdrew after about a fortnight. 58. ^ In July a still more intensive press campaign was opened, in which the Iraqi Government weie accused not only of laxity, but of deliberate incitement to rebellion and of refusing to surrender Jafar Sultan for ulterior purposes of their own. The Iraqi Minister in Tehran published a statement denying the facts and declaring that the conclusions and comments of the newspapers concerned were nuls et non avenus. The newspapers dismissed this denial as being a mere matter of form. 59. On the 4th August the Persian Charge d’Affaires conveyed to the Foreign Office a message from his Government complaining bitterly of the failure of the Iraqi Government to control brigands and rebels on the Kurdistan frontier, and arguing that it was His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom who were responsible for the existing state of affairs, since, in view of the treaty of alliance and other factors, Iraq was not really an independent country. He was told that His Majesty’s Government could not for a moment accept this imputation, and no more was heard of it. 60. The Iraqi Government for their part declared that a number of raids into Iraq which took place in August and September between Khalabja and13 Khaniqin were organised and led by Persian officers as reprisals for the help supposed to have been given by the Iraqi authorities to the rebels in Persia. 61. The special infantry battalion was withdrawn from the frontier in November. Frontier Relations. 62. Except in the Avroman and Shatt-el-Arab sectors of the frontier, there seem to have been few incidents, possibly because of the direct contact between frontier authorities established by the exchange of notes of the 6th December, 1932. 63. Very few of the Jaf tribe entered Persia during the year. Naft Khaneh. 64. Early in the year the Persian Government communicated to the Iraqi Government the text of a draft agreement for the settlement of the Naft Khaneh oil-field dispute. This dispute arose from the fact that the field lay athwart the frontier, that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company declined to work the Persian side of the field on the ground that to do so would be hopelessly uneconomic, at any rate in the absence of an arrangement for the entry of the oil into Iraq without payment of customs duty, and that the Persian Government believed that the working of the Iraqi side had the effect of draining away Persian oil to earn royalties for the Iraqi Government. On top of this the Persian Government had a general grievance about the “ transferred territories ” (see paragraph 96 of 1932 report). 65. The general purport of the draft agreement was that the area lying between the actual frontier and the 1913 frontier should be regarded as a “special zone.” In this zone technical operations should be carried out with a view to the possibility of exploiting the whole field in common and sharing proportionally the profits arising therefrom. The investigations and the exploitation were to be carried out by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Pending a final agreement the Iraqi Government were to pay to the Persian Government half of the royalties received by them from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company or its subsidiaries on account of the exploitation of the Iraqi side. 66. The one-sided nature of this bargain was obvious, especially as the provisional period was likely to last indefinitely. The proposals went beyond the agreement reached when King Feisal visited Tehran (see paragraph 98 of 1932 report), and altogether there was little chance of the Iraqi Government accepting it. But shortly afterwards the Persian Government succeeded in inducing the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to undertake the exploitation of the Persian side as part of the price of their new concession, and for the time being they may be assumed to have lost interest in their proposals. Treaties and Agreements. 67. No progress was made in the negotiation of any of the five instruments mentioned in paragraph 91 of the report for 1932, but they formed the subject of consultation between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Iraqi Government. The Persian Government did, however, express anxiety for the early conclusion of a treaty of neutrality, and this was also, owing to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance, the most important of the five instruments from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government. The Iraqi Government were advised that, while it was for them to decide whether a treaty of this kind was politically desirable, the most suitable form for such a treaty would be a text based upon article 1 of the model bilateral treaty of non-aggression drafted by the Third Committee of the League of Nations and the treaties of non-aggression concluded by France and Poland respectively with the Soviet Union. 68. An exchange of notes respecting the settlement of frontier matters took place on the 6th December, 1932, with a validity of six months. The period has since been extended to the 6th June, 1934. 69. The cc Accord provisoire ” of 1929 was duly renewed each six months, and the present renewal is valid till the 11th February, 1934.14 — A ssyrian Immigration. 70. In March Captain Rassam, the pro-Assyrian propagandist, visited Tehran with the object of securing permission for landless Assyrians from Iraq to settle in Persia. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs subsequently stated that, as a result of his representations, the Persian Government had consented to lift the ban upon the entry of Assyrians into Persia in large numbers, and had also undertaken to provide land for any who came. They had, however, made it clear that they did not in any sense invite the Assyrians to immigrate, and that they would only admit them if the Iraqi Government approved. They had also stipulated that once in Persia the Assyrians must become Persian subjects and abstain from all forms of politics. They must settle where they were told to do so, and the settlement would be so arranged that large numbers of Assyrians would never be together in one area. Shatt-el-A rab (Political). 71. At the beginning of the year there was still little prospect of the negotiations for the establishment of a tripartite Conservancy Board, which should have started in June 1932, starting in the early future. As the months passed, the prospect grew even smaller, and it became increasingly clear that, although the Persian Government might possibly not object to the Conservancy Board in itself, they had ceased to regard it as in any way a sufficient substitute for frontier rectification. 72. This view was made plain by the Persian Minister in Bagdad in interviews with the Iraqi Foreign Minister and King Feisal on the 12th March and the 12th May respectively. On each occasion he pressed strongly for the cession to Persia in full sovereignty of half the stream of the Shatt-el-Arab, but was told that the Iraqi Government could not contemplate such a surrender for an instant. Nuri Pasha added that he considered the question to have been definitely settled when he visited Tehran with King Feisal, and that this fresh demand amounted to a repudiation of the agreement then reached; the Iraqi Government would, however, gladly consider any arrangement short of territorial adjustment that might be necessary for the removal of genuine Persian grievances. When the Persian Minister subsequently saw the King, he said that there were only three solutions: (a) A voluntary cession by Iraq; (b) arbitration; and (c) the suspension of all discussions on this and other outstanding questions until the Shah visited Bagdad. The King replied that (a) and (b) were out of the question; to (c) there was no objection, although he regretted the delay. 73. There the matter rested until King Feisal visited London in July. During this visit Nuri Pasha drew the attention of the Foreign Office to the serious situation that had arisen owing to the habitual disregard by the new Persian navy of the rules made by the Port of Basra authorities for the safety of shipping in the Shatt-el-Arab and the territorial ambitions of Persia in this region. He was advised that the best way to meet this situation was for the Iraqi Government to press the Persian Government to accept the Conservancy Board scheme without further delay. This scheme was a practical remedy for any grievance which the Persian Government might harbour at having no voice in the control of the waterway; it was also essential to secure unified control of the river before many years elapsed if the Shatt were to remain a waterway at all; finally, even if the Persian Government rejected the scheme, the fact that the Iraqi Government had made the offer would enormously strengthen their position in the event of the Persian Government appealing to world opinion. Nuri Pasha appeared disposed to accept this advice. 74. During August opportunities occurred of recalling the scheme to the notice of the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Persian Charge d’Affaires in London, in the course of discussions regarding the behaviour of Persian warships in the Shatt-el-Arab, but no attempt was made to press it upon them, as it was felt that the Persian claim was primarily the concern of the two limitrophe States and that, tactically, it was desirable that the Iraqi Government, rather than His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, should take the lead in suggesting a solution.15 75. In November the Iraqi Prime Minister told His Majesty’s Ambassador that during the past few months the Iraqi Government had addressed eleven notes to the Persian Government about the behaviour of the Persian navy, without producing the slightest effect. He asked whether His Majesty’s Government would join the Iraqi Government in their protests on the ground of the danger which this behaviour caused to British life and shipping. It did not appear that up till then the Iraqi Government had taken any steps to press the Conservancy Board upon the Persian Government. 76. In December the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Minister that the Persian Government intended to embark on negotia tions about the Shatt-el-Arab at once, as the Shah wished them to be concluded before he visited Bagdad in the spring of 1934. Shatt-el-Arab (General). 77. Some mention has been made above of the misbehaviour of the Persian navy. This usually took the form of passing up and down the river at excessive speeds, even in haze or sandstorms; of taking up berths at Abadan Reach without reference to the port officer, and so causing general confusion; of manoeuvnng in Abadan Reach to the danger of other vessels and of entering the one-way Rooka channel from both directions without waiting for word from the control officer. Major Bayendor, the commandant of the navy, made it clear that he did not recognise the authority of the Port of Basra in any way; and even intimated indirectly to the local officials of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company that, while he would always be willing, if approached privately, to avoid action likely to inconvenience the company’s shipping, it was immaterial to him how much inconvenience he caused to the port authorities. 78. The situation was brought to a head by the arrest on the 23rd June of Captain Macleod, a harbour-master at Abadan Reach. Captain Macleod had gone on board the Persian warship Palang in order to place his sei vices at the disposal of the commander while the vessel.was going alongside one of the jetties at Abadan. This was in accordance with the usual practice by which trie services of harbour-masters were invariably offered to foreign warships, which were free (unlike merchant-vessels) to accept them or not at their discretion, and the commanders of Persian warships used, in fact, frequently to accept a haiboui - master’s services, in spite of their general attitude, whenever the operation on which they were engaged was at all difficult. Moreover, in this case, Captain Macleod had already arranged with one of the junior officers to come on board as soon as the vessel started to go alongside. Once on board he was allowed to proceed to the bridge, and it was only when he tried to leave that he was detained and subsequently placed under arrest by Major Bayendor. From the Palang he was removed to Mohammerah and kept under arrest in the naval barracks, where he seems to have been well treated. 79. Energetic protests were at once made by His Majesty s Charge d’Affaires against the illegal arrest of a British subject and by the Iraqi Minister against the arrest of an Iraqi official in Iraqi waters. The protests of the former led to the issue by the Persian Government of urgent orders for Captain Mac eod s release, and he was set at liberty on the 30th June. The protests of the latter led to little, except an acrid exchange of correspondence, m the course oi which the Persian Government officially claimed Abadan Reach as a Persian port. As regards the actual incident, the Persian Government explained that Captain Macleod had been arrested because he had boarded the Palang after being warne not to do so, and it transpired that he had, in fact, seen a seaman making some signal with his arms which he took to be a warning to keep clear of the pi ope eis. A nice legal point, which was not, however, discussed with the I ersian Govern ment, was that, when Captain Macleod went on board, the Palang had already passed a rope ashore, so that it was arguable whether she was in Persia or Iraq at the time. 80 After this incident the behaviour of the Persian navy certainly showed no improvement, and in October a serious accident was narrowly averted when the Persian warship Chahbaaz suddenly passed across the bows of the tanker British Captain as they were passing each other at the Inner Bar, causing the tanker togo aground. In this area special local conditions have led to the adoption of a special rule whereby vessels are required to pass starboard to starboard instead of port to port. The general manager of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company drew the attention of Major Bayendor to this special rule, supposing that the Chahbaaz might have sinned in ignorance. But Major Bayendor replied that he recognised only the ordinary rule of the sea, and that special rules made by the Port of Basra would be systematically ignored by his ships. 81. The resident-director of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company subsequently mentioned this and similar cases to the Minister of Finance, and represented the serious loss which the Persian Government as well as the company would suffer if a tanker were to run aground or explode, or if the Rooka Channel were to be blocked for a prolonged period. Similar representations were made later by His Majesty’s Minister to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but it is doubtful whether either Minister had the courage to state the truth to the Shah or the military authorities. 82. Apart from the Persian navy, the Persian customs authorities gave much trouble in the river. On the 6th December, 1932, a Koweiti dhow pro ceeding from Koweit to Fao with a consignment of sugar was arrested by a Persian customs launch. The crew of the dhow maintained that they were lying in midstream at the time. The Persian authorities maintained that the dhow was ashore on the Persian bank, and that the intention to smuggle the sugar into Persia was obvious. They admitted that the master had a manifest for Fao, but professed to regard this as a blind. The crew managed to escape after nine days, but the master and the dhow itself were detained. In spite of protests from His Majesty’s Legation, the master, who was claimed as a Persian subject, was kept in confinement for twelve months and then brought to trial. He was sentenced to one month’s imprisonment and a fine. The dhow was still detained at the end of the year. 83. On the night of the 5th July an Iraqi boatman was shot at and killed while crossing from the right bank to the Persian island of Muhalla. The other occupants of the boat reported that he had been shot by a Persian customs guard on the island. This was at first denied by the local Persian authorities, but later justified by the Tehran press on the ground that the man was probably smuggling, doubtless with the connivance of the Iraqi authorities, and that smugglers were fair game for any customs guard. However, on the morning of the 6th July, a Persian customs guard, who had gone on board the Japanese steamer Sato Maru, which was lying in the stream below Mohammerah, was arrested by Iraqi police on the charge of having shot the boatman. This action was probably taken in retaliation for the arrest of Captain Macleod, especially as the man was released later for lack of evidence connecting him with the murder of the boatman. It seems that the Japanese steamer was outside the limits of the port of Mohammerah and therefore in Iraq water at the time of the arrest. 84. On the 21st August a Koweiti water-dhow was hailed in midstream by a party of Persians in a launch and made to sail to a point on the Persian shore. The Persians were apparently police officials. Whatever their original intentions, they ended as simple robbers, and, having taken all their belongings from the crew, left them free to sail away. A complaint was later made to the chief of police at Gusba, and as a result of his investigations the principal culprit was discovered and sent under arrest, together with the stolen goods, to Mohammerah. The goods have not so far been returned to their owners. (C) Other Countries. U.S.S.R. 85. At the end of 1932 the dissatisfaction of the Persian Government at the methods of the Soviet trading organisations had found a vent in the imposition of an embargo upon trade with the Soviet Union in the Caspian Provinces. This embargo soon became general, and for most of the year trade between the two countries was at a standstill. During the winter and spring the Persian Govern ment showed no sign of being willing to withdraw the embargo unless the Soviet Government conceded their demands for a real balance of trade, as stipulated by the commercial treaty of 1931, and for the establishment of a central Persian17 buying and selling agency which alone should deal with the Soviet organisations. There was even talk in March of the denunciation of the commercial treaty, which was technically valid for three years. But although they made desperate efforts to dispose of the Caspian rice-crop through the ports of the Persian Gulf, and to find other markets, notably in Japan, for their cotton, it became apparent as ^ the months passed that Persia was the principal sufferer from the embargo, which would eventually have to be withdrawn unconditionally. The Soviet Government, for their part, showed that they were ready for a lengthy struggle by closing or reducing the staffs of their trading organisations in the north, thereby continuing a process which had already begun, largely on account of Japanese competition, in the south. 86. On the 20th March the Soviet Ambassador, M. Petrovski, who had only recently returned from sick-leave and would probably have remained in Tehran had a settlement of the deadlock been in sight, left to take up a new appointment in Vienna. His successor, M. Pastoukhoff, arrived some three months later and presented his letters to the Shah on the 6th July. M. Pastoukhoff’s arrival evidently gave the Persian Government a shadow of an excuse for making the first move, and on the 3rd August it was announced that the Association of Tehran Merchants, acting on the advice of the Government, who had “given them reason to hope for a settlement of existing difficulties,” had decided to resume trade with the Soviet Union. This example was followed elsewhere throughout the country. The Persian Government were doubtless impelled to this decision by the knowledge that the Caspian Provinces were on the brink of ruin, but the Soviet authorities showed no haste to come to the rescue, the trade representative explaining that on account of the embargo no provision had been made for purchases from Persia in the current year’s plans, and that he would have to go to Moscow to see whether quotas could be secured. 87. Soon afterwards, however, it became known that M. Karakhan, the Assistant Commissar for Foreign Affairs, would shortly come to Tehran on a visit, and the Persian Government may have hoped that their difficulties were at an end. If so, they must have had a rude awakening. The visit took place between the 29th September and the 7th October. It may have been a social success, and the Persians certainly tried to make it so, but its tangible results were meagre in the extreme, even allowing for a present of tanks and other weapons of war which M. Karakhan brought with him. In fact, the official communiqueTssued at the end of the visit could find nothing more encouraging to say than that commercial, economic, frontier and other matters had been discussed and that M. Karakhan had made “ certain promises,” which only meant, it appeared, that he had promised to consider the Persian requests when he returned to Moscow. The Persian press subsequently denied indignantly that one of the matters under discussion had been a 10 million dollar loan from the Soviet Union to Persia. 88. Nevertheless, negotiations continued in Tehran, and on the 10th December an exchange of notes took place between the Director-General of Commerce and the Soviet trade representative. These notes will probably not be published, and only the briefest account of them has been given to the Majlis and the press. According to a statement made in the Majlis, both Governments have agreed to abandon their mutual claims and pretensions and have settled the questions of the Persian rice-crop and the quantities of goods to be exchanged, the Soviet Government having undertaken to purchase the 1932 crop at 8 rials a pood and the 1933 crop at 9 rials. The Persian Government have also agreed to purchase annually 40,000 tons of sugar from the Soviet Union. Conversations are proceeding regarding other political and economic questions. According to the treaty section of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the notes modify the commercial provisions of the treaty of 1931. 89. The outcome of this trial of strength can only have increased the anti- Soviet sentiments of the Shah and his advisers. The voice of the Soviet Govern ment was heeded when the tone was sufficiently imperious—when, for instance, it threatened to prevent the delivery at Bandar Shah of rails for the northern section of the railway, unless all rails, for the north and the south alike, were purchased from the Soviet Union. But in other respects it may be said that Soviet influence not 52] c18 in the councils of the Government was dead, while the tracking down of Communist agents continued with vigour. 90. In April an agreement was reached between the Persian Fishery Company and the Soviet Government for the purchase by the latter of the year s output of the Caspian fisheries. This agreement took the place of a more ^ extensive agreement, which it had been hoped to reach, by which the Soviet^^ Government would have undertaken to purchase the whole available output for ten years. The distribution of the profits of the company between the I ersian and Soviet Governments remained unaltered. 91. In June ten bombing aeroplanes which the Persian Government had ordered in the Soviet Union, no doubt as a set-off to their purchases of British aeroplanes, were delivered at Pahlavi. 92. On the 3rd July Persia and the U.S.S.R. signed the Eight-Power Pact for the Definition of the Aggressor in War. 93. On the 26th September a number of armed Soviet citizens are supposed to have crossed the frontier at Gumbad-i-Kabus and cut off the head of a Turcoman called Araz, as well as killing his brother. The news was^ published in the press with expressions of assumed incredulity at the time of M. Karakhan’s departure, but was not mentioned again. 94. The Soviet consulates at Maku and Muhammadabad (near Sarakhs), and the Persian consulate-general at Tashkent, were closed during the year. 95. The number of refugees from the Soviet Union increased enormously, both into Khorasan and Azerbaijan. Many thousands were reported to have crossed between Julfa and Astara in the last part of July alone, while, between February and October, some 45,000 persons are estimated to have entered Khorasan, mostly Turcomans or Persians previously resident in Turkestan. As in the past, the treatment of those crossing the Khorasan frontier left much to be desired, while at one time great distress was caused in Tabriz by the issue of orders for all refugees, no matter how long established, to be moved to places further south. This order was, however, modified later, and on both frontiers the refugees seem on the whole to have been well treated once they reached the big cities. At the end of the year orders were said to have been issued that no further refugees should be admitted across the Khorasan frontier. Such orders have been issued before without much effect. Turkey. 96. After the tension of the last few years Turco-Persian relations were devoid of incident. 97. The delimitation on the ground of the frontier laid down in the treaty of the 23rd January, 1932, is understood to have proceeded quietly and satisfactorily. 98. In September the Persian Government revived the idea of a quadruple non-aggression pact between the United Kingdom, Turkey, Persia and Iraq, originally proposed by the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs (see paragraph 35 of 1932 report). The Turkish Government replied that they could not enter into such a pact unless they knew that the Soviet Government approved, and they suggested that the Soviet Government should be invited to join. The idea was accordingly discussed with M. Karakhan when he came to Tehran, and he is reported to have declared that his Government would welcome such a pact. A fghanistan. 99. Perso-Afghan relations made little noise during the year, although frontier difficulties arose from time to time. 100 100. In March the Ministry for Foreign Affairs asked His Majesty’s Legation for information regarding Major-General Maclean’s arbitral award in the Hashtadan Valley frontier dispute in 1891 (see paragraph 36 of 1932). The information required was given, but there do not seem to have been further developments.19 101. The Shah stopped the allowance which he had previously paid to Sardar Inayatullah Khan at the Persian New Year (the 21st March), thereby reducing the latter to great financial straits. Later on, his friends made efforts through His Majesty’s Legation to interest the Government of India in his fate, but without success, the Afghan Ambassador is known to have suggested to His Highness shortly before King Nadir Shah’s death that he ought to make his peace with the new regime and return to Afghanistan. 102. The Persian authorities made much trouble for Afghan residents in East Persia, by declining to renew their residence permits, and in other ways. They apparently suspected the Afghan subjects as a class of being active smugglers. Germany. 103. Dr. Lindenblatt, the former general manager of the National Bank, who had returned to Persia at the end of 1932 (see paragraphs 40 and 413-414 of 1932 report), was placed under arrest in April, having until then been kept under close observation. The charges against him were made known in August, and the trial took place in the first part of October. He was found guilty of misappropriating sums amounting to £7,000 and 46,000 rials, and not guilty on charges of having falsified the balance sheet of the bank and speculated on his own account with the bank’s funds, as well as on a minor charge of having paid an unnecessarily large gratuity to a German member of the bank whom he had dismissed. Live of Dr. Lindenblatt s German assistants who were tried with him were all acquitted. He himself was sentenced to undergo eighteen months’ correctional imprisonment on each of the two counts and to restore the sums which he had embezzled. The mildness of the sentences caused some surprise. The court explained in their judgment that they had taken into account the fact that the accused had been influenced by others (scilicet Herr Vogel), but as Dr. Lindenblatt’s peculations are generally believed to have amounted to' much larger sums than those mentioned in court, it is possible that he has partly compounded for his sins by a payment behind the scenes, and that, when he has served his sentence, he will retire to Germany to enjoy what remains. Meanwhile, however, both he and the public prosecutor have appealed against the verdicts. 104. Dr. Lindenblatt’s place as chief manager of the National Bank was taken in March by another German, Herr Horschitz-Horst, a former director of the Disconto Gesellschaft, and Germans still occupy most of the more important positions. A number of German experts of various kinds are also still in the employ of the Persian Government. 105. Dr. Schreinert (see paragraph 41 of 1932 report) was sentenced to six months’ correctional imprisonment in June, an Italian chauffeur and a Hungarian chauffeur, who were also accused of having aided Herr Vogel’s escape, being convicted at the same time. Sweden. 106. During the summer two Persian flying officers and four mechanics were sent to Sweden for instruction. In addition, an assistant to Captain Nordquist, Lieutenant Ekman, arrived in January, and four other Swedish instructors in aviation were engaged towards the end of the year. 107. The Swedish Minister in Moscow paid a visit to his Tehran post in April. M. Eric Carlberg (see paragraph 52 of 1931 report) returned to Tehran in May as consul-general, but this time without any commercial occupation. 108. The number of Swedish engineers in Persia is now very large as a result of the activities of the Kampsax Consortium. Denmark. 109. In April the Kampsax Consortium entered into a contract with the Persian Government to supervise the construction of the remaining portion of the Trans-Persian Railway. 110. As a result, large numbers of Danish and Swedish engineers found their way to Persia. This increase in their interests led the Danish Government [10152] c 220 to appoint a consul in April in the person of M. Toubro, the representative of a Danish firm engaged in installing a cement factory near lehran his appointment was followed by the arrival in December of M. Blechingberg, a member of the Danish diplomatic service, as a prelude to the establishment ot diplomatic relations whenever the Danish Minister in Moscow could find time to visit Tehran and present his letters to the Shah. Italy. 111. Perso-Italian relations can hardly have been cordial^ during 193d, although no serious matters were in dispute. Count \ iola di Campalto, who went on leave in August and did not return, persuaded the Italian Government to treat the Persian Minister in Rome in the same way that foreign Ministers are treated in Tehran in such matters as customs privileges, cartes d identite, &amp;c. At about the same time, the Persian press indulged in an outburst of indignation against a certain Count di Bonzi, who visited the Bakhtiari country during the summer with a party of Italian scientists and sportsmen, and later had the temerity to suggest in the columns of several European newspapers that wolves and bears existed in the Bakhtiari highlands, and that brigands were not unknown in Persia. The Imperial displeasure was so great that at one moment there was talk of all tourists being excluded from Persia in the future. 112. Some Italian officers and petty officers were still employed as technical experts in the Persian navy, but were all discontented. Out of twenty-five Persians who completed courses in electricity, wireless, &amp;c., in Italy during the year, only one passed. The rest were sent to France for fresh instruction Rumours were once current that the Persian Government intended to order further warships in Italy, but so far as is known they have so far only placed orders for a floating dock, an oil barge, and two small vessels. 113. Almost alone among foreign firms, Italian firms showed eagerness to accept contracts for the construction of sections of the Trans-Persian Railway, and it was supposed that they would receive subsidies from their Government. Large numbers of Italian workmen came into the country as a result, and it is anticipated that, by the end of 1934, no less than 1,000 Italian workmen will be employed in Persia. France. 114. The contract of M. Godard, the Director-General of Antiquities, was prolonged for a further three years. 115. The Air Orient (now merged in the Societe centrale pour E Exploitation des Lignes aeriennes) continued to use the Persian coast route throughout the year, but His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had under consideration the conditions on which foreign air services might use the Arab coast route. 116. Six French officers were expected in December to arrive shortly as instructors in the Persian army. They have been engaged on individual contracts and are not a mission. It is understood that the Persian Government desire to establish an “ Ecole de Guerre.” United States. 117. The claim of the Ulen Company still throws it shadow over Perso-American relations, and during the last month of the year the United States Charge d’Affaires delivered a stiff note to the Persian Government reopening the whole question. Earlier on a slightly comic incident occurred when the Persian police sought to arrest Mr. Dubois, the company’s representa tive, in connexion with the counter-claim which they maintain they have against the company, only to remember afterwards that he had left Persia some months before. 118. Mr. Carroll handed over the control of the South Persian Railway to Swedish engineers representing the Persian Government in March, and left the country shortly afterwards. On the 7th March he and another American engineer were captured by Lurs in the neighbourhood of Salehabad. A ransom of 200,000 rials was demanded and was promptly despatched by Mrs. Carroll21 At the same time, the local military authorities took energetic action on the Shah’s direct orders. In the meanwhile, however, the Lurs concerned had decided to surrender Mr. Carroll voluntarily in return for certain.assurances regarding their future treatment by the Persian Government, so that neither the ransom nor the military measures proved necessary. It seems that the Lurs mistook ^ Mr. Carroll for the railway paymaster. 119. The schemes of Dr. Friedlieb for securing various trade monopolies on behalf of the Persian-American Trading Corporation ended in smoke (see paragraph 543), even his tobacco monopoly falling through in the summer. He himself left for Europe in August, but returned in November. 120. Towards the end of the year the American Presbyterian Mission were engaged in discussions with the Persian Government regarding proposals for the closing of their mission and schools at Rezaiyeh, the recognition of the “ university ” degrees granted by the college in Tehran, and certain subsidiary questions, including that of the right of the mission to move its doctors from one post to another without the prior sanction of the Persian Government. The results of the work at Rezaiyeh, which is mainly among Assyrians, have for some time failed to repay the money and the energy expended there, and the mission are not sorry to close down. They expect to give some of the buildings to the Assyrian community and to sell the rest to the Persian Government. Rezaiyeh is the oldest existing mission in Persia. 121. Colonel Theodore Roosevelt passed through Persia in June on his way home from the Philippines, and was received in audience by the Shah. Mr. Hart resigned his appointment as American Minister when President Roosevelt came into office, and eventually left Tehran in November. Japan. 122. The commercial treaty of the 18th October, 1932, remained unratified. 123. Japanese trade with Persia continued, however, to expand, although there were signs that Persian dealers were beginning to be dissatisfied with the quality of Japanese goods, especially textiles. Large quantities of Persian cotton were bought and shipped to Japan in exchange for textiles, china, &amp;c. Japanese trade flourished as before mainly at the expense of the Soviet Union. 124. A new Minister, Mr. Okamoto, arrived in March. Belgium. 125. The Societe de Traction et d’Electricity de Bruxelles signed a contract for the erection of an electric power plant for Tehran on the 13th January. The contract was not, however, ratified, the reason being, according to the Belgian Minister, that the allowance for profits had been cut to so fine a point as to leave no margin for unforeseen damage. The contract was eventually put up to tender in October, the tenders to be submitted in January 1934. Netherlands. 126. The Royal Dutch Air Lines (K.L.M.) continued to use the Persian coast route throughout the year. The difficulties placed in the way of this ser\ice by the Persian authorities decreased as the year went on, but the Netherlands Government nevertheless pursued their enquiries as to the possibility of using the Arab coast route if need arose. Greece. 127. No progress was made with the claim of M. Dracos Pilides. A numbei of other cases engaged the attention of His Majesty s Legation and consulates, mostly cases in which difficulties arose over the administration of the estates ol deceased Greek citizens. 128. A Greek mission visited Persia in September to investigate the possibility of relieving unemployment among Greek engineers by taking up contracts for the construction of sections of the 1 rans-Persian Railway. I he mission left without forming definite plans, but their investigations had disposed them to proceed with caution. [10152] c 322 129. In December His Majesty’s Government asked the Greek Government to find some other country to protect their interests m 1 ersia owmg S volume of work with which His Majesty’s Legation were already obliged to cope. 130. The ratifications of the Perso-Greek treaties of the 9th January, 1931, were still not exchanged at the end of the year. Czechoslovakia. 131. The Skoda works continued to receive orders from the Persian army, and also engaged in the construction of various bridges m the Caspian provinces, including the ill-fated bridge over the Sefid Rud, the foundations of which were again washed away in September. Switzerland. 132. M. Brunner, the counsellor of the Swiss Legation in Turkey, spent a month in Tehran in the autumn negotiating a treaty of establishment. If js understood that this treaty will shortly be signed in Switzerland. A commercial treaty was also discussed, but little progress made. A ustria. 133. The honorary Austrian consul, M. Ehlers, found himself in difficulties with the authorities through administering the estate of a deceased Austrian citizen without the intervention of the Persian courts, and was finally obliged to make a payment of some 7,800 rials in order to satisfy various persons who alleged that they had claims upon the estate. 134. The Persian Government engaged some Austrian forestry experts during the year. In addition large numbers of Austrian workmen came to work upon the railway. Lithuania and other Countries. 135. The Lithuanian Minister in Moscow, M. Baltrusaitis, came to Tehran in May to present his letters to the Shah as the first Lithuanian Minister to Persia. 136. The ratifications of the treaties of Persia with Estonia of the 3rd October, 1931, and Finland of the 12th December, 1931, took place at Moscow on the 21st February, 1933. (D) International. League of Nations. 137. The report of the committee of enquiry into the traffic in women and children in the East (see paragraph 107 of 1932 report) caused an outburst in the Persian press, who proclaimed with one accord that Persian w^omen were patterns of modesty and quite unlike the notoriously frail women of the West. The reason for the outburst was not apparent, as the observations of the committee upon such matters as prostitution and temporary marriages were of the mildest description. The views of the press were not shared by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, who considered the report perfectly harmless. 138. In December the press inveighed violently against the proposals made in certain quarters for changes in the statutes of the League designed to give a preponderating influence to the great Powers. The Minister for Foreign Affairs made a statement in the Majlis on the 24th December expressing the firm opposition of the Persian Government to these proposals. Disarmament Conference. 139. On the 20th May the Shah sent a reply to President Roosevelt agreeing cordially with the tenets and purposes of his circular message about disarmament of the 16th May. 140. In the course of the discussions in the Technical Committee on Effectives, the Persian delegate explained that the figure of 72,000 men returned by his Government under “ formations organised on a military basis ” (see[10152] c 4 paragraph 108 of 1932 report), should none of them be included as effectives for military purposes. His contention was that they were all occupied in internal security work, being scattered over the country for the purpose of keeping watch on the tribes, and so counting as police and not as an army. Other members of the committee were clearly sceptical, and pointed out that if this proposal were accepted Persia would be shown as having no army at all. I he Persian delegate agreed that 12,000, representing artillery and machine-gun units, should be shown as effectives, but would not consent to a larger number. I he committee eventually decided to show the whole 72,000 as effectives, with an explanation of the special position in Persia. 141. The Persian army is, as a matter of fact, definitely a military force, organised, trained, and for the most part used as such (it is, for instance, kept- together in large units and not scattered in small posts). It is true that it could not be concentrated for offensive or defensive purposes without leaving the tribes dangerously uncontrolled, but that is a matter of internal politics, and if an understanding were reached with the tribes, there would be nothing to prevent the use of the army for purely military purposes. 142. On the 27th May the Persian delegate at Geneva communicated to Rear-Admiral Roger Bellairs the following particulars of the naval progi amme envisaged by the Persian Government, explaining that these particulars related to vessels covered by the definition in the British draft disarmament plan, and that the construction of this programme was without prejudice to the real needs of Persia :— Caspian Sea— Tons. Four destroyers ... ... ... 4,400 Persian Gulf— Three cruisers, class 1... ... ... 15,000 Two cruisers, class 2 ... ... ... 6,900 Ten destroyers ... ... ... 10,000 Four submarines ... ... ... 3,200 39,000 The effectives necessary for this fleet were given as 325 officers and 4,887 ratings. 143. The Persian Government threatened at one time to leave the Disarmament Conference unless the Persian Gulf were excluded from the special maritime zone proposed in connexion with the control of the traffic in arms. This question is dealt with under £&lt; Arms Traffic.” Optional Clause. 144. Some doubt arose at the time of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company dispute as to the exact meaning of the Persian acceptance of the optional clause (see paragraph 138 of 1931), which was declared to cover t£ tous les differends qui s’eleveraient apres la ratification de la presente declaration au sujet de situations ou de faits ayant directement on indirectement trait a Tapplication de traites ou conventions acceptes par la Perse et posterieurs a la ratification de' cettc declarationT^ After a study of the original Persian text of the declaration, it was decided that if some other country were to wish to bring a dispute between themselves and Persia before the Permanent Court of International Justice, it would be necessary for that country to show not merely that the dispute related to a situation or fact arising subsequent to Persia’s ratification of the optional clause, but also that it related to a treaty or convention concluded subsequently to that ratification. International A greement for the Prohibition of the use of White Sulphur in the Manufacture of Matches, 1906. 145. The second reading of a Bill sanctioning Persia’s accession to this instrument passed the Majlis on the 15th January, 1933. International Air Navigation Convention, 1919. 146. The Persian Government notified the French Government of their intention to withdraw from the convention on the 19th April, and the French24 Government took note of this decision on the 20th April. Ihe withdiawal of the Persian Government will consequently become eilective on the 20th April, 1934. A rms Traffic Convention, 1925. 147. This subject is dealt with under “ Arms Traffic.” International Convention for the Limitation of the Manufacture of Narcotic Drugs, 1931. 148. The ratification of Persia was deposited at Geneva on the 28th September, 1932. Eight-Power Pact for the Definition of the A ggressor in War. 149. This pact was signed in London on the 3rd July by Persia, the U.S.S.R., Poland, Roumania, Turkey, Lithuania, Afghanistan and Estonia. The pact was signed by Fathullah Khan Noury-Esfandiary, the Persian Charge d’Affaires in London, on behalf of the Persian Government. It was ratified by the Majlis on the 17th September. The Royal Assent was given on the 21st September, and the instrument of ratification was deposited in Moscow on the 16th October. (E) Treaty Table. 150.

These difficulties, and similar difficulties encountered by the German Legation, led to much discussion as to the validity of the “ safeguards as a whole. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs never stated to His Majesty s Legation in so many words that they regarded the “ safeguards as out of date, and t e y even indicated in one of their notes that they accepted their general validity, but they took the line that there could be nothing in the “ safeguards incompatible with Persian law, and that in a case of conflict a law passed subsequently to the “ safeguards ” would override them. With other Legations the Ministry were more explicit and stated that the “ safeguards were a unilateral undeitaking intended to cover a transitional period which had passed away with the perfection of the Persian judicial system and codes of law. 153. After careful consideration the Foreign Office decided that if a dispute arose, it would be impossible to show that the exchange of notes of the 10th May, 1928, constituted an international engagement in the sense that the Persian Government were bound by the notes not to change the legal provisions embodied therein without the consent of the foreign Governments concerned; but that, politically and diplomatically, the notes constituted assurances of great value which the Persian Government could not, consistently with comity, disregard unless they were in a position to show that the situation had altered radically since the assurances were given or could show good cause for disregarding them in any particular case. 154. Apart from the questions of visits to prisoners and of domiciliary visits, the interpretation of “ safeguard ” No. 12 (in so far as it related to the administration of estates) seemed likely to prove the most fruiful source of difficulty. The attitude adopted by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs when discussing the question with other legations showed that in their view this “safeguard” only meant that the estates of deceased foreigners should be administered in accordance with their national laws, but did not mean that the administration should be carried out otherwise than under the direction of the Persian courts and, in the absence of natural heirs, by the Persian authorities. Passport Law {January 10, 1933). 155. This law came into force on the 21st May, 1933. Article 3 makes the delivery of a passport dependent on the production of documents proving the identity and Persian nationality of the applicant, a stipulation which conflicts with the underlying principle of the Nationality Law, by which all persons in Persia are deemed to be Persian subjects unless they produce proof that they are not. Article 6 makes it possible for passports valid for four years instead of only for a single journey to be issued. Article 11 makes the issue of passports to women conditional on the consent of their husbands. 156. A circular issued on the 12th October stated that on grounds of reciprocity a separate visa fee would be charged to holders of British passports for each member of their family over 18 years of age. This order, if interpreted literally, would entail a separate visa fee for a wife travelling on her husband’s passport. There was evidently some misunderstanding, as the British regulations provide for a single visa fee to be charged to cover a man, his wife and children under 16 when travelling on a Persian passport. Law relating to Foreign Physicians {August 30, 1933). 157. This law provides that all foreign physicians, dispensers, dentists and midwives wishing to practise in Persia must, in addition to producing their diplomas, produce evidence that they have been in independent practice for at least five years before coming to Persia. An exception is made for doctors and others already in the country. The General Department of Health is authorised, when issuing licences, to specify the locality in which the applicant may practise, and the Council of Ministers is authorised to suspend the issue of licences altogether whenever it is considered that the numbers of foreign doctors is sufficient. Foreign physicians must pav a fee of 2,000 rials when receiving their licences and foreign dispensers, dentists and midwives a fee of 1,000 rials. These fees are additional to the taxes levied on all physicians in Persia, whether Persian or foreign. Regulations issued under the law in November specify the27 procedure to be followed by applicants for licences, the documents to be attached to each application and the foreign institutions whose diplomas are recognised by the Persian authorities. Income Tax Law (November 20, 1933). * 158. The principal changes introduced by the new law are higher rates of 'tax on profit-earning companies and the levy of a progressive income tax on merchants and traders, according to their net profits, in place of a licence tax graded according to their annual sales. The categories of taxpayers are also reduced and simplified. Exemption is explicitly accorded to membeis o diplomatic missions, and also, on condition of reciprocity to consular officers and employees of Embassies, Legations and consulates, provided they are nationals ol the country concerned. The two principal British institutions are not affected, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company having compounded their taxes in the agreement of the 30th April and the Imperial Bank of Persia being exempt under their concession. (G) Miscellaneous. Flags. 159. In April the “ chef du protocole ” sent a circular letter to heads of missions expressing regret that foreign diplomatic missions and consulates still flew their flags every day, and pointing out that there was no justification for this practice when complete security reigned throughout the country. 160. This request was debated by the Diplomatic Corps, and it was agreed that each mission should seek instructions from its Government. The doyen had previously told the IVlimster for Foreign Allan's that the Diplomatic Coips could not recognise the right of the Persian Government to interfere in the flying of flags by Embassies and Legations, though they might possibly be willing to comply with a request to reduce the amount of flag-flying if asked to do so as a favour. The Diplomatic Corps recognised that it would probably be necessary to comply unconditionally in the case of consulates. 161. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was authorised to adopt any course that commended itself to the majority of the Diplomatic Corps. No further meeting of the corps took place before the end of the year, but the Soviet Embassy, as the result of representations made in Moscow by the Persian Ambassador, have ceased to fly their flag except on special occasions. The Belgian Minister, on the other hand, states that his instructions are that he is not in any circumstances to stop flying his flag daily. 162. The Persian Government were much incensed at an article in a June number of the Neai' East which stated that the Diplomatic Corps had taken exception to the fact that the circular mentioned above had been signed by the “chef du protocole” instead of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and suggested that in the eyes of the Persian Government the daily flying of flags was a sign of a capitulatory regime. Quarantine. 163. Quarantine against plague was imposed for short periods in January and again in May on persons arriving from Iraq, while certificates of vaccination were required for some weeks in the autumn. 164. The quarantine tax at Mirjawa was discontinued early in the year (see paragraph 563 of 1932). Propaganda. 165. There is again no mention of appropriations for press subsidies in the budget for the current year 1933—34. i he items ” Foreseen and Unforeseen Expenses” (1,500,000 rials), “Secret Expenditure” (200,000 rials) and “Gratuities” (100,000 rials) remain the same as reported in the last annual report. “ Official Entertainments,” costing 300,000 rials, may also provide material for propaganda.166. At least two members of the Persian Government (the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the head of the police) have during the past year been honest enough to confess, in conversation, that the newspapers in Persia do not publish anything which is not in conformity with the desires of the Government. The idea of an independent press is so foreign to the present official mentality of Persia that it appears useless to insist that the press in the United Kingdom, is not, and cannot be, controlled. As the head of the police remarked : “ You must measure us with our own yard-stick ’ ’; any Government, said he, which is worthy of the name of Government must be able to impose its views on its press; therefore, when they saw criticisms of Persia in the press of Great Britain, they thought, and should go on thinking, that His Majesty’s Government was criticising them. 167. The spate of anti-British articles during the Basidu crisis, and in refutation of the observations of Mr. de Bathe in the Times, have been mentioned elswehere in this report. The fact that laudatory articles on Persia appeared in the Times after the Persian objections was regarded by the head of the police as a sign that our press is not independent. 168. The campaign against the Qajar dynasty, which was just beginning at the end of 1933, appears to be based on a hazy theory that the more mud is thrown at the previous Royal family now, the more difficult it. would be for a Qajar to usurp the throne during the Shah’s projected voyage to Europe. III.— General Treaty Negotiations. 169. No negotiations took place during the year, but their resumption was the goal to which both His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Persian Government looked forward whenever such obstacles as the oil dispute and Basidu should permit. 170. His Majesty’s Minister went on leave in June, and the opportunity was taken of reviewing, in the light of his opinion, the terms upon which His Majesty’s Government might conclude a general treaty. But although various suggestions, such as a voluntary withdrawal from Hen jam, were considered, and many minor points settled as the result of inter-departmental correspondence in London, definite instructions had not reached His Majesty’s Legation before the end of the year. It was, however, decided that the idea of giving the Persian Government a present of arms and machinery roughly equivalent in value to the cost of providing a new Residency and naval depot outside Persia, on condition that the Residency and the depot were allowed to remain where they were, was impracticable (see paragraph 157 of 1932 report). 171. In August His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires suggested that considera tion should be given to the desirability of attempting to secure the addition of a paragraph to the draft article about Basidu which should safeguard the position, especially in such matters as the ownership of land, of any of the inhabitants of the British area who might be British subjects or British-protected persons. 172. Towards the end of the year the arrival in Tehran of M. Atychides (see paragraph 109 of 1932 report) led His Majesty’s Minister to review the drafting of the claims article. He thought it possible that, although the Persian Government wished to exclude “war” claims from consideration under the treaty, they might change their minds when they discovered that the exclusion of “ war ” claims would exclude the claim of M. Atychides. Moreover, if His Majesty’s Government declined to discuss this claim on the ground ’that it involved the reopening of a case already decided by a prize court administering international law, the Persian Government might decline to discuss any claims at all. He had learned that the Persian Government were keeping this claim as a counter to the numerous claims of British subjects, but that, if the claims question was not settled in the treaty, they were ready to take it to the League of Nations. In the circumstances, he suggested that, as a preliminary measure, the facts of M. Atychides’s claim, as well as its legal aspects, should be carefully re-examined.29 173. The events of the year may have somewhat increased the value of Basidu as a bargaining factor by making the Persian Government more anxious than before to see the last of the British occupation, but they also disclosed the fundamental legal weakness of that occupation. I he Zahedan Railway also assumed added importance in Persian eyes, to judge from the efforts of the Minister of Communications to secure its reopening in advance of the treaty. 174. The question of a bilateral arms traffic agreement, which is closely concerned with the general treaty, is dealt with in paragraph 179 onward. IV.—British Interests. (A) Persian Gulf. General. 175. As a result of the numerous representations which His Majesty’s Legation were obliged to make on behalf of the Arab rulers of the Gulf, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs displayed some curiosity during the summer as to the exact relations between these rulers and His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. There were various objections to referring the Ministry directly to Aitchison's Treaties, since these volumes, although available to the public, contained much information that might suggest to the Persian Govern ment new ways and means of being tiresome. His Majesty s Charge d Affaires suggested as an alternative that he should be authorised to communicate to the Persian Government the texts of the leading agreements with the Arab rulers, as communicated to the Italian Government in 1932 (see paragraph 206 of 1932 report), and, after some discussion, this suggestion was accepted. The exclusive agreements of 1892 with the Trucial Sheikhs had already been communicated to the Persian Government, in 1928. 176. But, in the meanwhile, the Persian Government, who were seriously annoyed at the arrest of the Mudir of Customs at Basidu in October, took the opportunity, when replying to a complaint about the searching on the high seas of a Koweiti dhow by a Persian warship, to state that all discussions which had previously taken place between His Majesty’s Legation and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs respecting the affairs of the Arab rulers were regarded by them as having had a purely private character, and that they did not recognise the right of His Majesty’s Government to address them on behalf of these rulers. This was stated to be a reaffirmation of the attitude adopted by them in 1928, when they had declared that they could not recognise any agreements between His Majesty’s Government and the Arab rulers which affected the interests of Persia. 177. Some discussion also took place in the autumn between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and His Majesty’s Charge d’Affairs regarding the origin and effect of the status quo agreement. Subsequently, when replying to a complaint about the visit of a Persian warship to the Island of Tamb, which His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires had described as a violation of the agreement, the Minister for Foreign Affairs declared (without being more specific) that this interpretation of the status quo was not accepted by his Government. This was probably not intended as a complete repudiation of the agreement, but as an assertion of the right of the Persian Government to attach their own interpreta tion to the status quo in specific cases. 178. In April the commandant of the Persian navy issued regulations requiring all foreign merchant vessels to fly the Persian flag when calling at Persian ports. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs were informed privately that it was most unusual to make regulations on such a point. Arms Traffic. 179. During the early part of the year the difficult problems created by the objection of the Persian Government to the inclusion of the Persian Gulf in the special maritime zone of the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925, or any successor to the convention, were the subject of prolonged departmental examination.180. It was common ground that special measures of control were required in the Persian Gulf, and that the principle of the special zones ought, if possible, to be maintained. The main question for decision was whether it was essential to keep the Persian Gulf (and the Gulf of Oman) in the special zones, or whether control of the traffic in arms could be assured by other means, such as a bilateral arms traffic agreement with Persia. 181. If His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were to succeed in securing the inclusion of the Persian Gulf in the special zones (which was problematical in view of the half-hearted interest of the other Powers), the Persian Government would, it was known, refuse to be a party to the agreement in which this provision was embodied. Their abstention would have the disadvantage that His Majesty’s ships would be unable to “ investigate ” vessels flying the Persian flag. On the other hand, it would have the compensating advantage that Persian warships would not acquire the right of “ investigating ” any vessels, including Indian and Arab vessels, which did not fly the Persian flag. This advantage was, however, qualified by the fact that Persia might always change her mind and adhere to the agreement at some future date, thereby acquiring rights which might prove very damaging to the prestige of His Majesty’s Government. It was, moreover, considered that, generally speaking, the Persian Government would not in any case acquire the. right of searching Arab vessels, the Arab rulers not being parties to the agreement, so that the question of Persian abstention lost some of its importance. 182. The alternative to the inclusion of Persia in the maritime zones was a special bilateral agreement with Persia, to cover the Persian Gulf, together with a general agreement to cover all other maritime areas. The Persian Government were known to be ready to conclude an agreement by which the control of Persian vessels would be reserved to Persian warships, and the control, or at least the “ investigation,’ of all other vessels to British warships. It would clearly be necessary for the Powers who were parties to the general agreement to acquiesce in the control of vessels flying their flag, when in the Persian Gulf, by His Majesty’s Government. But there was reason to think that the other Powers generally would welcome any arrangement which His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government might reach between themselves to cover the Persian Gulf, and that their acquiescence might be forthcoming. 183. The mam objection to a bilateral agreement was that His Majesty’s Government would thereby lose their right of searching Persian vessels for arms. But as this right was based upon a permission (commonly, but inaccurately, called the firman of 1897 ) accorded by the Persian Government thirty-six years before to meet circumstances which no longer existed, and as there was nothing m the terms of the note m which this permission was accorded to prevent the Persian Government from revoking it at a moment’s notice, it was doubtful whether its loss would be a very substantial disadvantage. Moreover, the mere inclusion of the Persian Gulf m the special zones would not confer any rights on anyone so far as Persian shipping was concerned. The shadowy nature of the light was admitted in some quarters, which nonetheless maintained that there was a general though possibly mistaken, impression in the Gulf that the British navy possessed certain powers of control with regard to the traffic in arms, and that any action likely to destroy this impression, such as a public surrender of e principle of the special zones or a public disclaimer of the right to search avoided VeSSe S ’ mi » ht lead to a recrudescence of the arms traffic and ought to be 184 In other quarters again, it was held that while this might be true in a general way, the possibility of a serious recrudescence of the armf traffic in the Gulf was very remote. There was, finally, the political aspect which was that e Persian Government illogical as it might seem if the implications of inclusion were carefully studied, objected to the inclusion of the Persian Gulf in he specM zones on grounds of national pride, and that if His Majesty’s Government were ^ m f et \ them t0 the extent of concluding a bilateral agreement, to which thev attached a curious importance, they would not only vastly improve their Disarmament 1 Conference! aV ° ,d ^ ° f the ° ther Powers at31 185. With little except these conflicting principles to guide him, the United Kingdom representative on the sub-committee of the Disarmament Conference dealing with the traffic in arms exchanged views from time to time with his Persian colleague. The latter told the sub-committee on the 13th March that his Government regarded the special zones as an infringement of the sovereignty of the country whose territory was concerned. The United Kingdom representative could only reply that his Government did not consider that the arms traffic danger could be met by any bilateral agreement between themselves and the Persian Government. At the same time, he suggested that the removal of the word “native” from the term “native vessels” wherever it occurred in the draft convention, which had the result of making the vessels of all contracting Powers alike subject to control if under 500 tons, would go far to meeting the Persian objections. The Persian representative indicated that he did not attach much importance to the abolition of the category of £ £ native ’ ’ vessels because the Persian Government objected to the special zones on moral ” grounds. The sub-committee subsequently decided on the 15th May to refer the question of the Persian Gulf to the Plenary Committee. 186. Meanwhile, at the special request of the Persian Government, the Secretary of State had on the 24th April received Anushirvan Khan Sepahbodi, the Persian Minister in Switzerland (and later under-secretary at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs) in order to discuss this very question. The Minister set forth the Persian case on familiar lines and pressed either for a bilateral agreement, which other Powers could be asked to recognise, or else for a modification of the special zone scheme, by which the boundary of the zone would pass down the centre of the Persian Gulf. He indicated that if the whole of the Gulf were included in the special zones, the Persian Government would be obliged to withdraw from the Disarmament Conference. 187. The plan of dividing the Gulf was thought to be impracticable, but after much discussion a note was sent to the Persian Charge d'Affaires in London on the 3rd June accepting in principle the idea of a bilateral agreement, subject to international acceptance of its terms, the conclusion of the agreement within the framework of the Disarmament Conference and the inclusion of safeguards against the misuse of the Persian flag. The form of safeguard proposed was an article empowering both British and Persian warships to verify the flag of any vessel suspected of illegally flying the Persian flag. The Persian representative on the sub-committee later remarked to his United Kingdom colleague that this proposal was most one-sided, and it may have been owing to the difficulty of accepting such a proposal, as well as to the series of crises which arose soon afterwards in Anglo-Persian relations, that the note of the 3rd June was still unanswered at the end of the year. 188. The constant searching on the high seas by Persian warships of Arab vessels suspected of carrying contraband led His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in October to suggest the desirability of considering whether some addition should not be made to the draft slave trade and arms traffic agreements which would prevent Persian warships from searching non-Persian vessels on the plea that they were looking for some other form of contraband than arms or slaves. 189. It was decided during the year that there was nothing to be gained by publicly cancelling the Muscat arms proclamation of 1898, which accorded the Persian Government the right, inter alia, of searching Muscat vessels for arms in Muscat, Indian or Persian waters. The Persian Government had probably forgotten about this proclamation, and if anything were to bring it to their notice it could immediately be cancelled by the Sultan. If, however, public cancellation ever became necessary, it would, it was agreed, be necessary to make an official notification to the Persian Government ex 'post facto. Bahrein. 190. In May the Ministry for Foreign Affairs returned to the charge in the matter of the travel documents required by Persian subjects proceeding to Bahrein (see paragraph 169 of 1932 report), but no reply was sent. 191. At the same time they made various complaints about the treatment of Persians in Bahrein by the ‘ £ British adviser ” and the Political Agent. Apart32 from individual cases, they complained that the former had stopped the entiy of all Persians into Bahrein for a period of a month, that the Bahrein Government were dismissing all Persians from posts under the Bahrein Petroleum Company and that all Persian subjects were compelled to register at the British agency. 192. The first of these complaints was imaginary. As regards the oil ^ company, the Ministry were told in due course that the engagement and dismissal ^ of the company’s employees was carried out by the company, which was a private concern, and not by the Bahrein Government (although, as a matter of fact, the company’s concession included a clause, analogous to that in the new Anglo-Persian Oil Company concession, obliging them to employ Bahreinis as far as possible). As regards registration, it was explained that orders for the registration of all foreigners at the British Agency had originally been issued on the 27th February, 1929, but republished on the 30th March, 1933; registra tion was an advantage to Persians as well as to other foreigners, since their status as foreigners was thereby recorded and they thus enjoyed the privileges accorded to foreigners in Bahrein. 193. The case of Lutfali Khonji was settled during the year. The Persian Government and Robabeh Sayyareh herself continued to agitate for her to be allowed to return to Bahrein. 194. On the 26th January the International Postal Union circulated the text of a letter they had received from the Persian post office protesting against the use of Indian stamps surcharged with the word “ Bahrein,” on the ground that Bahrein was Persian territory; the letter also announced that envelopes arriving in Persia from Bahrein with any stamps except Persian stamps would be regarded as unstamped, and only delivered on payment of double the inland postage. It was agreed that the Indian postal administration should address a letter to the Union rebutting the statement that Bahrein was Persian territory and making it clear that the sheikh was within his sovereign rights in using any stamps he liked. This was done on the 24th March. 195. Meanwhile, it was becoming increasingly difficult to delay any longer the issue of the surcharged stamps, and, after some discussion as to the best moment for effecting the change and the explanations, if any, to be given to the Persian Government, the stamps were brought into use on the 10th August without any further communication to the Persian Government. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was prepared to tell the Minister for Foreign Affairs, if he raised the question, that the Persian Government might have noticed that the surcharged stamps were still not in use some months after their protest of September 1932, and that the intention of His Majesty’s Government had been to let the matter remain in suspense in the hope that a treaty would soon be concluded; but that the letter to the Union had rendered the continuance of such a policy impossible, and a definite decision to bring the stamps into use had been taken at that time. The Persian Government did not, however, revert to the question. 196. It had originally been suggested that the Political Agency should continue to use unsurcharged Indian stamps for letters addressed to Persia, but this proved undesirable and impracticable when it came to the point, and arrangements were made for such correspondence to be posted in Koweit or elsewhere. 197. During the summer and autumn trouble of a new kind arose, when the Persian authorities started refusing visas and exit visas to holders of British passports bearing endorsements for travel to Bahrein or Koweit. The idea underlying this attitude was fairly obvious in the case of Bahrein, but less obvious in the case of Koweit, for, though Persia did not recognise any of the Arab principalities, it was only Bahrein that she openly claimed as Persian territory. His Majesty’s consul at Basra, where many visas for Bahrein were given, was authorised to retaliate by refusing visas for Bahrein or Koweit to holders of Persian passports unless the passports were specifically endorsed for these places. Later in the year, however, the Persian Government abolished the system of specific endorsements, at any rate in the case of passports issued for use in the Persian Gulf, so that this method of retaliation broke down. Other suggestions, including one to the effect that the specific endorsement of British33 [10152] D passports for Bahrein and Koweit should be discontinued, seeing that a visa from a British consular officer was in any case necessary for persons travelling to these places, were under consideration at the end of the year. Bahreinis in Persia. 198. No special cases involving the ill-treatment of Bahreinis in Persia came to the notice of His Majesty’s Legation during the year. Basidu. 199. In March a protest was addressed to the Persian Government respecting certain incidents that had occurred in September and December 1932, when Persian officials had entered the British area and collected taxes from persons owning date gardens there. In April the caretaker reported that the Persian Mudir of Customs was habitually using the British area as a point of observation and searching dhows anchored in the adjoining waters. 200. The protest made in March was followed in May by a private letter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, informing him that the chief of police of Kishm Island has been heard to talk of establishing a police post in the British area, and asking him to see that the actions of subordinate officials did not, as in the past, lead to difficulties. 201. In June the Mudir of Customs informed the senior naval officer that he had orders from his superiors at Lingah to enter the British area whenever he wished in the course of his duties. 202. On the 7th July the Governor of the South Ports visited Basidu and asked the caretaker whether he did not know that the whole area was Persian territory. 203. In the middle of July another protest was sent to the Persian Government regarding attempts which had been made by Persian officials to intimidate some of the owners of date gardens whose taxation had formed the subject of the protest made in March. 204. These matters were mere forerunners of the storm that was to break on the 31st July, when four officers from a Persian warship hauled down the Union Jack from the flagstaff in the British area. 205. This outrage was discovered by H.M.S. Bideford, who found the flag lying at the foot of the flagstaff when she visited Basidu on the 5th August, and promptly rehoisted it. The caretaker was away, but, from the accounts of the coolies charged with the duty of hoisting the flag each day, and from careful enquiries made subsequently by the senior naval officer, it appeared that a Persian warship, probably the Palang, had visited Basidu on the 31st July. Several persons came ashore, and four officers, including the commandant of the Persian navy, Major Bayendor, had walked towards the flagstaff. One of them was seen to haul down the flag, and it was later found at the foot of the mast with a tear in it; there was, however, no entirely conclusive evidence that the Persian officers had torn it. An Italian, no doubt one of the engineers employed in the Persian navy, and a Frenchman, probably M. Benard (see paragraph 264), were among those who landed, but did not go to the flagstaff. The Palang steamed away the same evening. 206. The main facts of this incident were never disputed by the Persian Government. 207. On the 6th August a permanent naval guard was landed. 208. On the same day His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires happened to meet the Minister for Foreign Affairs and told him that a serious incident had occurred at Basidu. He asked him to obtain full information from the Ministry of War so as to be able to discuss the question when his instructions arrived. A week later the Minister sent word that no orders about Basidu had been given to the Persian navy, and that the Ministry of War did not even know there was a flag there. The action of the naval officers (who had not, however, deliberately torn the flag) was entirely spontaneous, and they would certainly take no such action in future without referring to Tehran.34 209. Meanwhile, His Majesty’s Government were considering what course to adopt. The Acting Political Resident (Lieutenant-Colonel Loch) and the senior naval officer were of the opinion that the incident has been e iierately staged, probably with the approval of the Persian Government, and that, in order to restore British prestige on the Arab coast, some \isible lepaiation was required. The most fitting form of reparation would be the rehoisting and saluting of the British flag by the Palang, or, failing that, the immediate and genuine dismissal of the officer responsible. His Majesty s Chaage d Anaires had, however, formed the opinion from further conversations with the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Persian Government were genuinely shocked at the behaviour of the Palcing, which had come as a complete surpi ise to them, and that their explanation that the officers of the Palang had been unaware of the position at Basidu, and had, on finding the British flag flying there, for no apparent cause, and without anyone in charge, taken what had then seemed to them the obvious, though admittedly foolish and improper, course of removing it, was, incredible as it might seem, made in all good faith. ^ 210. He believed that, though a ceremony of the kind proposed by the Acting Political Resident might be forthcoming as the result of extreme pressure, insistence upon it would destroy the whole fabric of conciliation built up on the exchange of Royal messages, and alienate for all time the sympathy and confidence of the Shah. The first result of insistence upon a ceremony would, moreover, be a new demand for the evacuation of Hen jam. Insistence upon the dismissal of the responsible officer would probably have almost as bad an effect, and there would be no guarantee that the culprit would not be rewarded and promoted in another branch of the service. 211. In the circumstances, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires recommended that he should address a formal protest to the Persian Government and ask for : (1) a written assurance that the action of the Persian navy was neither instigated nor approved by the Persian Government; and (2) the issue of stringent orders against the recurrence of such incidents. At the same time he would deliver a warning to the effect that such forbearance could not be repeated, and suggest orally that the officer responsible ought to be punished. If the Persian Government refused even this moderate degree of satisfaction, they should be told that the negotiations for the general treaty could not be resumed and steps would be taken for the shadowing of the Persian fleet. 212. A prolonged exchange of views followed between London, Tehran and Bushire, during which the situation was aggravated by the visit of a Persian warship to lamb (see paragraph 282). Before the exchange was complete the Persian Government, whom His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires had been urging to offer some spontaneous reparation for the insult to the flag, made, on the 26th August, a formal, though oral, communication in the following sense :— (a) The Minister for Foreign Affairs could and did assure His Majesty’s Charge d Aflaires emphatically that the Basidu and Tamb incidents occurred without orders from the Persian Government, who entirely disapproved. (b) Categorical instructions had been sent to the Persian navy that, in future, when confronted with an unusual situation of an international kind, they were to report for orders before taking action. (c) Similar instructions had been sent to the Persian navy that they were to avoid all interference with British naval arrangements and to collaborate m all possible ways. This communication was at first made to Mr. Baggallay by the head of the Lnghsh section. It was confirmed in general terms by the Minister for Foieign Affairs himself to Mr. Mallet a day or two later. The Minister or oreign Affairs also indicated that Major Bayendor had been severely f u dl Tr hed ^ ^ ie who had been much upset by the incident, and hoped that the present assurances would suffice to close it. '2Y6. -p p m V taneously with the receipt of these assurances the Acting o i ical Resident reported that wild rumours were circulating on the Arab coast, and expressed the opinion that the Arab rulers should be informed of the c s o e mci ent. He added that the communication would naturally carry35 more weight if the rulers could be told that the Persian Government had offered satisfactory reparation or apologies. His Majesty’s Charge d’Afiaires suggested that the assurances he had just received should suffice as a basis for such a communication, since they implied regret and a promise of good behaviour in future, even though they did not amount to reparation. 214. A further general exchange of views ensued, during which the senior naval officer reported, on the 31st August, that Persian propaganda was rife on the Arab coast, and that rumours of the withdrawal of the British from the Gulf were being actively spread. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires expressed his conviction that the Persian Government were not responsible for this propaganda, and strongly, deprecated a suggestion that they should be asked to stop the rumours, since such a request would be a far greater confession of weakness than a failure to extract visible reparation. 215. The orders of His Majesty’s Government were finally issued on the 5th September. They were to the effect that no demand should be made for a ceremony at Basidu, but that His Majesty’s Charge d Affaires should endeavom to extract from the Persian Government a note confirming the oral assurances already given. At the same time, the First Destroyer Flotilla was to visit the Gulf, arriving at Hen jam on about the 15th September, in order to show the flag on the Arab coast. If all went well, this flotilla might later pay a courtesy visit to some Persian port. Finally, a circular was to be addressed to the Arab rulers giving the true facts of the incident, including the rehoisting of the flag by H.M.S. Bide ford, and indicating the nature of the explanations and assurances received from the Persian Government. If a written confirmation of the assurances was received, a further circular would probably be authorised. 216. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires accordingly saw the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 9th September. His Highness was very reluctant to furnish a written note, and particularly to mention that disciplinary action had been taken against Major Bayendor, but he promised to consult his colleagues. He then tried to retaliate by objecting to the landing of the armed guard, and its retention at Basidu, after he had given assurances that the flag would be respected in future. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires replied that the question of Basidu was to be settled in the treaty, and that any attempt to jump a claim to the British area in advance of the treaty could not be tolerated He also told the Minister about the visit of the destroyer flotilla to the Arab coast, in which his Highness professed to take no interest, and urged him to settle the outstanding questions connected with the Gulf, and especially the dhow incidents, as the surest means of restoring good relations. 217. On the 12th September a note was received from the Persian Government. It embodied points (b) and (c) of the oral assurances, but contained no specific mention of Basidu, no expression of regret or disapproval at the flag incident, and no reference to disciplinary action against the responsible omcer. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires suggested that a reply recapitulating the assurances as His Majesty’s Government had understood them should be sent to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in reply. 218 At this point the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mirza Mahomed Ali Khan Feroughi, became Prime Minister, and the charge of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs devolved temporarily upon the Under-Secretary Mirza Anushirvan Khan Sepahbodi, pending the arrival from Bagdad of the new Minister Seyyid Bagher Khan Kazemi. Just as the new Cabinet was m process of formation, a paragraph appeared in the British official wireless news on the 16th September stating that, in response to a protest by His Majesty s Legation, the Persian Government had expressed regret at the flag incident and given assurances against its repetition. This paragraph was inserted as a correction to more sensational accounts of the incident in the British press, which had just learnt about it. The incident had in fact been a secret until then to anyone outside official circles either in London or Tehran, although it was common knowledge all over the Gulf. 219. The Persian press immediately seized upon the word protest, and denied that one had been received. But the fulminations of the press were followed by more serious developments. On the 20th September the Prime [10152] D 2—— 36 Minister informed His Majesty’s Charge d Affaires that the Shah was furious with him (Feroughi) over tne publicity which the flag incident and the 1 ersian assurances had now received. He particularly objected to the suggestion that the action of his Government had followed on a protest, and to the use of the phrases ‘ ‘ apology ’ and ‘ ‘ British possession in certain British newspapers. The Shah was also upset at reports of building activity at Basidu, and at the continued retention there of the naval guard, but His Majesty s Charge d Aflaires made it clear to the Prime Minister that a request for its removal would probably have the opposite effect to what was desired. 1 he interview ended with an appeal from the Prime Minister for some action which would save his face with the Shah. Without some action he was ruined. Both the Prime Minister and the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was also present, admitted on this occasion that His Majesty’s Government had “certain rights’’ at Basidu and that there was a British concession. 220. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires thereupon suggested to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom :— (1) The possibility of a further communique avoiding the particular phrases to which the Persian Government took exception. (2) Some reassuring statement regarding building at Basidu. (3) An early reply to the Persian note of the 12th September on the lines he had already suggested, with an additional statement that the incident was closed. 221. But, before any decision could be taken, a further note, dated the 21st September, was received from the Persian Government asking that the British troops which had landed at Basidu in disregard of Persian sovereignty should be withdrawn without delay. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires instantly visited the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs with the intention of returning the note. The latter made no attempt to defend it, but stated that if he were to take it back he would have to tell the Shah, and would undoubtedly be sent straight to prison. The Shah was in a furious temper on account of the press notices, and only the day before had had the Prime Minister dragged from his presence, publicly reviling him the while as a silly old fool, who, at his age, had let himself be tricked by the British Charge d’Affaires. If only the note could be kept for a few days until the Shah cooled down, it could then be returned quietly as non avenue. Meanwhile, he urged that something should be done about the naval guard in order to save Anglo-Persian relations from complete shipwreck, the Shah, in spite of his rage, still wanted good relations, and expressed his inability to understand why the British navy should pursue this vendetta against the Persian navy because of a foolish act born of ignorance and inexperience. 222. His Majesty s Charge d’Affaires did not express any opinion to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, but, on his return to Gulhek, he suggested to the Foi eign Office that, in addition to the three points he had already lecommended, the 1 ersian Government might be told orally that the guard would soon be moved in the ordinary course of duty, although His Majesty’s Govern ment letamed the light to replace it whenever they wished. In makin 0, this recommendation he added that, in a second conversation with the Acting Minister oi Foieign Affairs, he had gathered that the Shah now realised that he had gone t? 0 ^ 11 rvS &lt; ^ ei i in f no ^ e a bout the guard to be sent, and was satisfied that the oreign Office had acted for the best in inserting the paragraph in the British official wireless news. He also realised that the fact that the incident had been witnessed by two foreigners made it impossible that it should have remained a ^etmdefimtely. The Prime Minister was out of danger for the moment, but, m older to restore complete harmony, the action he had recommended should vfit nf vTk-' 7 ' 11! 1 W !n f ' rtl ? ernl 4 0re ; desirable to close the incident before the Ibout a week s tTme ' S ° Vlet ASS1Stant C “^ ^ Foreign Affairs, in 223. In reply His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom wns seTtn Ibe A e r? a M f &amp; 'T 0r leSS on the lines recommended, and it was sent to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 23rd September In addition to recapitulating the oral assurances received on the 26th August, it37 [10152] D 3 declared the incident closed and asked for an early settlement of other incidents arising from the activities of the Persian navy. At about the same time the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs was told unofficially that no building had taken place at Basidu, but only a few minor repairs. 224. His Majesty’s Government did not favour the issue of a further ^ communique, but the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs stated a few days later that the Shah had lost all interest in this point. His Majesty’s Government also stated that the question of the withdrawal of the guard could not be considered until the reaction of the Persian Government to the note was known. 225. The Persian Government were very reluctant to accept the categorical terms of the note of the 23rd September, and His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires more than once felt it necessary to urge members of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs not to prolong the incident by returning a reply that was anything but a simple acknowledgment. Their reply, however, which was signed by Kazemi (who had meanwhile taken over the Ministry) and was dated the 8th October, after expressing pleasure at the closing of the incident, raised two points. The first concerned the exact wording of assurance (c), and was of minor importance. The second was a complaint regarding the publicity given to the incident, doubtless added from a desire to have the last word. 226. This reply was still being considered when news was received of the arrest of the Persian Mudir of Customs by the naval guard on the 9th October, and the Basidu crisis entered on its second phase. 227. The mudir had, it appeared, on the evening of the 9th October, gone on board a dhow (a Persian dhow as it happened) lying at anchor off the British area, and had asked to see the master’s papers. On coming ashore he was asked by the officer in charge of the guard to explain his conduct. He replied that he considered “ British ” Basidu and its waters to be Persian territory, and that he had acted in accordance with his instructions, which were to carry out his duties in any part of Basidu. The mudir, who had been warned on previous occasions not to trespass in the ‘ ‘ British ' ’ area, was then taken with his ferrash on board H.M.S. Lupin. At an enquiry held on board the following morning, he went back on his statement of the previous evening, and alleged that he had°merely paid a private visit to the dhow. Later, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom decided that he should be taken to Bandar Abbas and handed over to his superior authorities there. 228. It was generally agreed that whatever justification or lack of justification there might have been for the arrest of the mudir, it was desirable to enter a protest against his intrusion into the ££ British ” area before the Persian Government could enter a protest against his arrest. 229. A note was accordingly sent to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 14th October, complaining of the incident and stating that the mudir’s action was a clear breach of the status c[uo, under which His Majesty’s Government exercised exclusive rights in the ££ British ” area. 230. At the same time His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires expressed to the Foreign Office the utmost concern at the effect which this arrest might have on Anglo-Persian relations and the results which might follow if the Persian Government raised the whole question of the status of Basidu. 231. These apprehensions were soon justified, and on the 19th October a note was received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs protesting vigorously against the pretensions of His Majesty’s Government, which had' they said, grown from a claim to keep a coal depot to a claim to exercise jurisdiction; the note also denied the relevance of the status quo agreement, in view of the fact that the Peisian Government never had, and never would, recognise any British proprietory rights at Basidu, and asked for the punishment of the officers responsible for the arrest. 232. At the same time a series of exceedingly unsatisfactory notes were received regarding the visit to Tamb and the various dhow cases. The tone of these notes were undoubtedly prompted by extreme annoyance at the mudir incident.38 233. On the 22nd October a debate was staged in the Majlis, m the course of which the Minister for Foreign Affairs read out the texts of the notes exchanged with His Majesty’s Legation, omitting only a passage m the British note which referred to the complaints—which had been accepted without remonstrance—made during the early part of the year about the activities of Persian officials in the “British” area. He also suggested that the Persian Government had made many protests about Basidu in recent years, whereas m reality they had only made a single oral enquiry, in the year 1920, as to the origin of the rights which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom enjoyed there. He ended by declaring that the Persian Government would defend their rights to the full. 234. This debate was followed by an intensive press campaign, the articles all taking the line that His Majesty’s Government had no standing whatever at Basidu and that the arrest of a Persian official on Persian soil was a most amazing act on the part of a Power that did lip service to the League of Nations. 235. The Persian Government also declined to give permission for H.M.S. Hawkins, flying the flag of the Commander-in-chief, East Indies, to pay visits to Henjam, Bushire and Abadan. As a result of the general atmosphere, the idea that the First Flotilla destroyer might pay a courtesy visit to a Persian port was abandoned. 236. The consideration of the immediate action required in the face of this display of Persian truculence was complicated by the discovery on the 24th October that His Majesty’s Minister, who had been expected in Tehran that day, was still in London, having been detained for the discussion of certain proposals connected with the treaty negotiations. On the 30th October, however, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires addressed a further note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs reaffirming the view that, under the status quo agreement, His Majesty’s Government enjoyed in the British area all the rights which they had enjoyed there during the last 110 years, including that of exclusive jurisdiction. 237. In the course of subsequent conversations with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and other Persians, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires gained the impression that the Persian Government would have been far less upset if the mudir had been merely returned to Persian Basidu instead of being taken to Bandar Abbas. They thought that, in the circumstances, the least His Majesty’s Government could do was to disavow the naval officers concerned, just as they themselves had disavowed the officers who hauled down the flag, and they indicated that if such a disavowal could be made, all would be well. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was obliged to point out that there was no comparison with the flag incident, as in each case the trouble had started from the Persian side, and that disavowal was out of the question. Moreover, the publicity given to the mudir incident by the Persian Government was in blatant contrast to the patient attitude of His Majesty’s Government over the flag incident. The Minister for Foreign Affairs admitted that the publicity had gone far enough (and, in fact, the press campaign was restrained for a time after the presentation of the note of the 30th October), but indicated that the mudir incident had touched the nation to the quick, and that unless it could be settled the Persian Government would have no option but to bring the whole question of Basidu before an international tribunal. 238. ^ Ihe only action which appeared feasible at this stage was to give the Persian Government some sort of assurance that His Majesty’s Government were still ready to surrender their rights at Basidu as part of a treaty settlement; but as it had recently been suggested in inter-departmental discussions in London that His Majesty s Government should retain Basidu unless they could obtain a satisfactory lease of Henjam for at least twentv-five years, it was difficult to offer even this assurance. 239. On the 4th November another note was received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs stating that the Persian Government understood from the note of the 30th October that the status quo was the only ground on which His Majesty s Government relied in defending the arrest of the mudir. It then went on to reassert, quite incorrectly, that Persian officials had always carried out their duties m the British area, a term to which the Persian Government in any case39 took strong exception. It repeated the request for the punishment of the officers, and hinted at a reference to an international tribunal. 240. On the same day the Persian Government indicated their willingness to allow purely unofficial visits by H.M.S. Hawkins to Abadan and Henjam. This was the sequel to a good deal of plain speaking on the subject by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires. 241. On the 13th November His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was informed that the Law Officers of the Crown had expressed the opinion that the historical and documentary evidence in support of the British occupation of Basidu was insufficient to enable His Majesty’s Government to maintain that the rights they had hitherto enjoyed there need only be surrendered by agreement, while the value of their prescriptive title, though difficult to appraise, would probably be insufficient to turn the scale if the question came before an international tribunal. 242. His Majesty’s Minister returned to Tehran on the 19th November and, after an interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs a few days later, recommended that he should be authorised to inform the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government had been obliged to issue orders for the disposal of the mudir on telegraphic reports, and that having now received full reports by mail, they were satisfied that their interpretation of the status quo would have been equally well safeguarded had they simply ordered that the mudir should be taken back to his post and had then protested to the Persian Government; and that it was entirely absent from their intentions to humiliate a friendly nation. He thought that if the message went on to say that Basidu would be returned to Persia if a treaty were concluded, and the guard were simultaneously withdrawn, the Shah would probably drive his Government into a general settlement. 243. On the 28th November the inspector of customs at Bandar Abbas visited Basidu and went alongside a dhow lying in the waters off the British area. On being asked by the officer in charge of the guard to withdraw, he did so without demur. 244. On the 29th November His Majesty’s Minister, who had just been asked by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come and discuss a matter of great urgency, received authority to tell the Persian Government, either orally or in writing, that His Majesty’s Government thought the best solution of the Basidu controversy was the conclusion of a general treaty in which the British rights at Basidu would, inter alia, disappear, and that, meanwhile, relying on the assurances of the Persian Government, they had ordered the naval guard at Basidu to be withdrawn. He was also authorised to add, by word of mouth only, that His Majesty’s Government had formed a less grave view of the mudir’s conduct after receiving fuller reports, and had had no desire to humiliate a friendly nation. 245. The “matter of great urgency” proved to be the appearance of offensive articles about the Shah in the British press, and, although His Majesty’s Minister delivered the message, Basidu was forced into the background for the next few weeks, except that the press campaign was revived. 246. In the meanwhile orders had been conveyed to the senior naval officer for the withdrawal of the guard and of the guardship, which had remained in the vicinity since August. These orders added that the flag should be left flying, and that occasional visits should be paid by His Majesty’s sloops. In view of the weakness of the British position, as disclosed by the Law Officers’ opinion, a blind eye was as far as possible to be turned to Persian efforts to find smugglers. When it proved impossible to ignore their efforts altogether, force was not to be used. The officials concerned were to be invited to withdraw from the British area, and if they declined, the matter was to be reported. At the same time no avoidable action was to be taken which might lead the Persian authorities to suppose that His Majesty’s Government intended to withdraw from Basidu. (The previous orders, issued in 1928, had been that in the last resort Persian aggression against the British area was to be resisted by force.) 247. There was clearly a possibility that in their present mood the Persian Government might consider themselves absolved from the guarantees they had [101521 d 440 given about the flag, while the effect of inviting Persian officials to withdraw from the British area when there was no intention of making them do so might prove more derogatory to prestige than doing nothing at all. In any case, the Political Resident, who had returned from leave in October and had already suggested that, in view of the Law Officers’ opinion and of the danger of the Persian Government appealing to arbitration, the desirability of withdrawing from Basidu altogether (which would include the withdrawal of the flag) should be considered, now expressed his views afresh. He added that so far as the Arab rulers were concerned, the withdrawal could be explained on the ground of the inconvenience of Basidu and the extent to which the guard had suffered from malaria. 248. His Majesty’s Minister supported this suggestion, with the addition that the Persian Government should be told that a British warship would go to Basidu from time to time as in the past, and land parties, in order to preserve the rights claimed by His Majesty’s Government and so retain Basidu as a bargaining factor in the treaty negotiations. He also suggested, after consultation with the Political Resident, that a sum of about £300 should be placed at the latter’s disposal to assist in compensating or removing elsewhere any of the inhabitants who were likely to suffer as the result of coming under Persian administration. This point had already been raised by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in the summer in connexion with the treaty negotiations. 249. The Commander-in-chief, East Indies, thought that immediate withdrawal would be inopportune, and the suggestion was still under consideration when the mudir incident was finally liquidated at the end of December. 250. By the 12th December it appeared that the press articles crisis was well on the way to solution, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs thought the Basidu incident could be settled, too, if His Majesty’s Minister, who was to see the Shah on the 18th December, would before then confirm in writing the message he had delivered on the 29th November. His Majesty’s Minister did so in a private letter, but the Minister for Foreign Affairs complained that the part of the message about His Majesty’s Government having taken a different view of the incident after receiving fuller reports and having had no intention of humiliating a friendly nation was not given in the letter. These were the points which His Majesty’s Minister had only been authorised to make orally. The Minister for Foreign Affairs eventally agreed to let the question wait until after the audience. 251. At this audience His Majesty’s Minister managed to convince the Shah that if the written communication which he and the Minister for Foreign Affairs desired were to be read out in the Majlis or published, further comments might appear in the British press, with the result that the mudir incident, so far from being closed by the communication, would be revived and rendered more serious. The Shah agieed, and said that if His Majesty s Minister would write the whole of the message, a simple statement in the Majlis that the incident was closed should be sufficient. 252. His Majesty’s Minister accordingly recommended to His Majesty’s Government a draft based on the original message, with certain alterations of torm designed to make it additionally attractive to the Shah. This draft, with some turther alterations^ was approved, and a note embodying it was sent to the mister for Foreign Affairs on the 28th December. The official acknowledgment was not received before the end of the year, but with its despatch the mudir incident may be said to have ended. 253. lowards the end of December the Political Resident learned that the Belgian Inspector of Customs at Bushire might go to Basidu in the course of a vis! he was about to pay to Bandar Abbas. M. Dekerckheer, the Belgian Administrator-General of Customs, assured His Majesty’s Legation that the journey had no connexion with Basidu. He added that the activities of the mudir a been instigated by the local Governor and not by his superiors in the Customs dl l not , b . e ^ leve , a y, smu gg lin g was now taking place through British Basidu, though there had been a good deal four years previously. He promised to inform His Majesty’s Legation of any revival.41 Bushire Residency. 254. No developments occurred in the matter of the possible transfer of the Residency. 255. In August the local post office indicated that they could not accept any packets sealed with a seal in which the word “ Residency ” occurred. Hen)am (Political). 256. An echo of the events of 1927 and 1928 was heard when the former Sheikh of Henjam, Sheikh Ahmed, who had made his peace with the Persian authorities in 1928 and had since been living in Henjam, was summoned to Bandar Abbas and detained for eight days. It appeared that the widow or mother of the Mudir of Customs murdered in 1927 had appealed to the Governor of Bandar Abbas for blood money, for which Sheikh Ahmed denied liability. After being interrogated, the sheikh was released on security of 20,000 rials. Henjam (General). 257. Just before the close of 1932 a note was received from the Persian Government admitting that if the deratisation certificate of the steamship Baroda (see paragraph 192 of 1932) had still three days to run when she reached Henjam, the quarantine medical officer had been wrong in preventing people from boarding her. The note added that the officer had been removed. This proved to be correct, though it was learned later that he had received a better appoint ment in the Kermanshah area. 258. In May two slaves from Ras-ul-Khaimah took refuge at Henjam. They went on board H.M.S. Bide ford, but later went ashore again of their own accord. His Majesty’s Minister at once mentioned the matter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and instructions were sent to the Deputy-Governor to let the slaves depart in one of His Majesty’s ships if they wished to do so. They were eventually conveyed to Bahrein. 259. With the important exception of the visit of the First Flotilla Destroyer in September, no difficulties seem to have arisen during the year between His Majesty’s ships and the Henjam authorities over such matters as quarantine, identity cards, &amp;c. 260. On the occasion of the visit of the flotilla, however, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the local authorities were bent on making unnecessary difficulties. As the vessels of the flotilla were not permanently stationed in the Gulf, the Persian Government had been notified of their visit. It is known that the latter sent the necessary instructions to the Governor of the South Ports not later than the 14th September, and the Deputy-Governor is known to have received urgent telegrams from both Tehran and the Governor on the same day. But, when the flotilla arrived at midday on the 15th September, the Deputy-Governor stated that he had no instructions and forbade the quarantine medical officer to grant 'pratique. &gt; In view of the political aspect of the cruise (see the section on “ Basidu ”), the senior naval officer felt that it was impossible to accept such treatment at the outset and, having assured himself of the health of the flotilla, he sent the bills of health to the Deputy-Governor with an oral intimation that he had assumed pratique. It was only on the 17th September that the Deputy- Governor admitted having received his instructions. 261. On the 5th June Mr. Morton, one of the staff of the Imperial and International Communications Company at Henjam, was assaulted and badly wounded by a gang of three persons. The local authorities acted with considerable energy, and a number of arrests were made. Eventually, three men were detained, two of them being former servants of members of the company’s staff who were believed to have a grudge against Mr. Morton either on their own account or on account of some friend. The dossier of the case was sent to Bandar Abbas, and it was understood that the three men, who were in the meanwhile released on bail, would be sent there for trial in September. At the end of the year His Majesty’s Legation were still endeavouring to ascertain the intentions of the Persian authorities with regard to bringing them to trial.42 Liqhtinq and Buoying in the Gulf. j xria 9 262 On the 3rd June the Ministry for Foreign Affairs informed Kis Majesty's Legation that the Persian nav y h ?d /ngaged an exp t t draw up plans and estimates for the management of the , na I 1 f H a \ 1 ?”‘fifgXials shores of the Shatt-el-Arab and the Persian Gulf, and asked that the omciais in charge of the lights might give the expert any necessary gmd^ when he embarked on his ta D sk. His Majesty's Legation rephed thatthey would seek; .. instructions from His Majesty’s Government in the Lmted Kingdom, ana wo , in the meantime, be glad to learn the expert s name. 263. After some rather protracted inter-departmental discussion the Ministry were informed on the 5th August that, so far as the ig ® 0 ^ e S p of the Persian Gulf were concerned, these were managed by B asia Jort ^ Directorate on behalf of the Government of India, and His Majesty s Government would gladly approach the Iraq Government in order to secure the release of any officials who might be required to assist or They hoped, however, that the examination might be deferred until Colonel Wa rd, the Director, who was then on leave, was available to assist the expert in perso . His Majesty’s Government hoped that in any case the Persian Government wou consult J them before making any new arrangements, owing to the inter dependence of the lighting system throughout the Gulf, and would bear m mmd th^ proposals already made for placing the whole of this lighting under the •management of the Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Board. As for the lights m the Shatt-el-Arab, the Persian Government should approach the Iraq Government direct. 264 A day or two after the despatch of this note it was learned that a Frenchman, who stated that he had been engaged as a lighting and buoying expert, had on the 3rd July asked permission to inspect the lights on the telcnaphs building at Henjam. He had previously visited Qais Lightship, and later in the month he inspected the lights at Jask and Charbar. He also visited the lighthouse on the non-Persian island of Tamb (see paragraph 282). At Heniam he stated that he had been travelling in the Persian warship since the beginning of June, was heartily tired of his work and had no illusions as to the ability of the Persian Government to manage their own lights. The Persian Government had hitherto been most secretive as to their expert’s identity, but it transpired from private sources that his name was Jacques Benard, and that he represented the firm of Benier, Barbier, Turenne et Cie. 265. Towards the end of August the Ministry for Foreign Affairs were informed that His Majesty’s Government thought it discourteous of the Persian Government to have proceeded with the examination of the lights without waiting for a reply to their request of the 3rd June, but that in any case His Majesty’s Government considered it essential for the safety of navigation that there should be a uniform lighting system throughout the Gulf, and were most anxious that the Persian Government should make no changes without first consulting the Port of Basra directorate. 266. In October His Majesty’s vice-consul at Mohammerah reported that the Persian Government were believed to have cancelled M. Benard’s contract and to have handed his work over to a Danish engineer named Kendt. * 267. On the 13th November the Ministry for Foreign Affairs sent a reply to the representations of His Majesty’s Legation. The precise sense was obscure, but the gist was that while no immediate changes were contemplated to the lights on the Persian coast, the Persian Government would in future manage these lights themselves. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires considered that until the position of the Conservancy Board was clearer, there was no object in pressing the Persian Government to explain their exact intentions. Naval Visits. 268. No difficulties or changes occurred in connexion with the routine arrangements for visits by His Majesty’s ships to Persian ports. 269. In September the Persian Government agreed to an arrangement whereby His Majesty’s ships permanently stationed in the Gulf should fire a43 salute at Bushire, and the Port of Bushire should return the salute, on the occasion of the first visit paid by each ship each year to the Inner Anchorage. The Outer Anchorage and Reshire were not to count for saluting purposes. For some time previously no salutes had been fired at Bushire, although the port of Bushire was scheduled as a saluting station, because the Persian authorities had no authority to return salutes, or, indeed, any means of doing so. On the occasion of the visit of H.M.S. Hawkins in January, however, two guns were placed in front of the Governor’s house for the purpose of returning her salute, and salutes were also exchanged when H.M.S. Enterprise visited Bushire in May. HM.S. Ormonde and Sirri Island. 270. Permission was sought during the summer for H.M.S. Ormonde to continue her survey work in Persian waters during the winter of 1933-34. The same reservation was made as regards Sirri as in 1931 and 1932. The necessary permission was given in November, the Persian Government taking the opportunity to assert that Sirri was Persian territory de jure as well as de facto. Persian Naval Activity. 271. The orders prescribed for the reception of Persian vessels visiting the Arab coast (see paragraph 210 of 1932) were modified somewhat in January. It was decided that if a visit were to take place without prior notification and the commander were to seek to pay a ceremonial visit on the ruler concerned, he should be received, except at Bahrein, and a protest against the absence of notification lodged subsequently at Tehran. At Bahrein the answer was to be left to the discretion of the Political Agent, on the understanding that ordinary courtesies should not be withheld provided the behaviour of the commander and crew was in all respects correct. 272. In May His Majesty’s Minister repeated to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the warning he had given to Teymourtache the previous autumn (see paragraph 209 of 1932) to the effect that the Arab rulers would expect prior warning at the least before units of the Persian fleet visited their coasts. 273. As the result of visits paid by H.M.S. Hawkins to Abadan and Bushire in January, excellent relations were established between the British and Persian fleets. The subsequent behaviour of the Persian fleet was, however, calculated to destroy those relations altogether. The incidents at Basidu and Tamb and in the Shatt-el-Arab have been dealt with elsewhere. Apart from these incidents, the principal cause of complaint against the Persian navy was their constant interference with Arab dhows on the high seas. 274. On the 10th April the Babr stopped a Koweiti dhow, the Fath-ul- Khair, near Hen jam, and forced her to follow to Bandar Abbas. The vessel was certainly more than 4 miles from the Persian coast when first hailed, and the incident was aggravated by the lack of consideration and bad seamanship of the Babr, which made the dhow heave to in a heavy sea and then crashed into her bows, doing damage to the extent of 300 to 400 rupees. The dhow and her crew were subsequently released by the Director of Customs at Bandar Abbas. 275. On the 21st May a Persian warship, probably the Simorgh, hailed another Koweiti dhow, also called Fath-ul-Khair, while at anchor about 10 miles from Bushire, but having searched the dhow, which was suspected of smuggling opium, and interrogated the master, allowed her to proceed. 276. On the 10th September a boat from the Trucial Coast was boarded and searched by the Babr about 17 miles off the Persian coast near the Island of Sheikh Shuaib. The Babr made off on sighting H.M.S. SJioreham approaching in the distance. 277. In addition to the activities of the navy, an armed Persian customs launch anchored for two days off Khasab, a port belonging to the Sultan of Muscat, with a captured Persian vessel in her charge; the launch must also have used Muscat waters as a base for affecting the arrest, although there was nothing to show that the arrest itself had occurred in Muscat waters. 278. Each of these cases formed the subject of a protest to the Persian Government, any suggestion that the mere passage of the launch through Muscat44 waters was in itself an offence being avoided in the fourth case. In the first case the Persian Government took the line that the vessel was not on the high seas at the time; in the second they ignored the high seas point and simply said that if a vessel was suspect, it was only natural that a warship should search it; in the third no reply had been received by the end of the year; in the fourth they replied that no visit by a customs launch to Muscat waters at the date mentioned could be traced. 279. The Persian navy was also active against Persian dhows. One of the more sensational incidents was an encounter between the Shahrokh and two dhows which fired upon her off Shibkuh in March and later proved to contain a gang of organised smugglers. This may have been the occasion of a story told by the Italian Charge d’Affaires, who alleged that in one encounter the Persian officers and men went to ground in the engine-room when the firing started, and that the warship only escaped capture because two Italian engineers, fearing that the smugglers might be too excited in the confusion of the moment to distinguish between Persians and foreigners and, consequently, kill them in the general massacre, rallied to her defence (but not out of any love for the Persians). 280. These and similar incidents were the outcome of the decline in the customs revenues which had been making itself felt for some time, much to the Shah’s annoyance. This decline was attributed by the Persian Government to the prevalence of smuggling, which the Trade Monopoly Law and high tariffs render inevitable, although in reality the Trade Monopoly Law restrictions were sufficient by themselves to account for a large loss of revenue. However this may be, there can be no doubt that the Persian official world is slightly hysterical on the subject of smuggling at the present time. Slave Trade. 281. No cases of slavery were reported during the year. Tamb and Abu Musa. 282. On the 23rd July the Persian warship Palang visited Tamb, and a party which included the commander and a French lighting expert (see paragraph 264) landed and inspected the lighthouse. They remained about ten minutes, drew a sketch plan and gave the lighthouse keeper a signed certificate that all was in order. 283. A vigorous protest was addressed to the Persian Government in the name of the Sheikh of Ras-ul-Khaimah, to whom the island belonged. Exception was taken to the visit of the warship without prior notification through the diplomatic channel, and to the official inspection by Persian officers of a lighthouse that was neither Persian property nor on Persian soil. Attention was also drawn to the breach of the status quo involved. 284. The Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed regret at the time, but it was not until the 21st October that a written reply was received. This reply sought to vindicate the action of the Palang on the ground that the Persian Government regarded Tamb as their property, not only de jure but de facto (which was absurd), and on the latter ground swept the status quo argument aside. Up to the end of the year no reply had been sent to this note, the tone of which was undoubtedly inspired by the mudir incident at Basidu. 285. In September the Sheikh of Ras-ul-Khaimah told the senior naval officer that he had received from Tehran a letter asking him to lease the Island of Tamb to the Persian Government. He was unable to produce this letter when called upon to do so, and it was probably mythical. . ( B ) East Persia. Baluchistan Frontier. 286. In the spring the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on several occasions took exception to the fact that the Government of India were repairing the levy post at Qila Sefid (they thought at first that the Government of India were building a new post altogether). They took the line that this post lay in45 disputed territory, and that as the rectification of the frontier would probably be accomplished in a few months any repairs were not only a waste of money to the Government of India, but also in some manner not very clearly explained prejudicial to the Persian claim. 287. The Persian Government made no attempt during the year to resume the survey of the frontier districts, perhaps because their surveyor was occupied on the Perso-Turkish boundary. Extradition. 288. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were able to inform the Persian Government in the course of the year that Muhammad Khan had gone to Afghanistan and that Lashkar Khan had died of measles, thereby postponing a discussion of general principles. 289. In June the Persian Government informed His Majesty’s Legation that a certain Taj Muhammad Reki, who had attacked a customs official and thereafter taken to a life of brigandage in the Kuh-i-Bampusht, had fled to India with some followers after being defeated by Persian troops. They carefully avoided making a request for extradition, but asked that he should be removed from the neighbourhood of the frontier. His Majesty’s consul for Sistan reported later that Taj Muhammad was still in the Kuh-i-Bampusht, and only crossed into Kalat territory when hard pressed by Persian frontier guards or Baluch Sardars. 290. A few cases of raiding across the frontier occurred during the year. Land Customs. 291. The practice of sending silver and other valuable goods into Persia for the express purpose of re-exporting them to India over the land frontier assumed alarming proportions in 1933. It is also possible that this route was used for sending Soviet money and literature into India. Towards the end of the year His Majesty’s Minister suggested that some means should be devised to stop this re-export trade, but that at the same time the mild advantages of deferring the imposition of a land customs barrier until the expiry in 1936 of the Trade Autonomy Treaty should not be left out of account. Zahedan Railway. 292. Inter-departmental discussions took place during the year as to the conditions on which the Zahedan Railway might be transferred to the Persian Government on a commercial basis, that is to say, in the absence of a general treaty (see paragraph 242 of 1932 report). In April the Government of India stated in this connexion— (1) That the annual loss on working the section between Nok Kundi and Mirjawa would probably be about 1 lakh of rupees (say about £7,500). (2) That the value of exports from India to Persia was greater in the year following the closing of the railway than in the previous year. (3) That the reopening of the railway might assist the maintenance of a land customs barrier, if one were introduced. (4) That the break-up value of the section in Persian territory was about 22^ lakhs (say £170,000). But since the material could hardly be removed in the face of Persian opposition a lower offer would be considered. (5) That the operation of any section of the railway in India by the Persian Government could not be considered. 293. Their conclusion was that the only conditions on which India could reopen the railway would be— {a) If they received a good price which would recoup them for some of the money spent on its construction. (b) If the Persian Government made some commercial concession to stimulate Indian trade.46 They also required— (c) A satisfactory arrangement for separate exchange stations at Mirjawa. They added that they could not agree to through trains, at any rate at first. 294. In general the Government of India were disposed to wait for offers from the Persian Government and consider them on their merits e on y i element of urgency was that if there was no immediate prospect ot reopening, the Railway Administration desired to withdraw from Nok K,undi, wheie t ere was no water, to Dalbandin. 295. In response to further enquiries the Government of India stated in September that they could not fix their minimum price for the Persian section in advance of an offer by the Persian Government, and that the commercial concessions they would desire would be the complete exemption of all goods ot Indian origin from the operation of the Trade Monopoly Law. They added that if the Persian Government proposed to extend the railway to Sistan they should not receive any encouragement, as the fact that such encouragement had ‘^n given might prove embarrassing if it were subsequently desired to close the Indian section. It also appeared that there was no possibility, owing to lack ot water, of having the two exchange stations on Indian soil, an aiiangement which otherwise would possess many advantages. Finally, the Government of India were unwilling to consider any arrangement on the lines that the Persian section should be transferred and the Indian section kept running for a period of ten years, on the understanding that the Persian Government made good the annual deficit up to a fixed sum, say 1 lakh. 296. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Communications had been pressing for a reply to their request for a specimen contract of sale for the railway material they required. This was eventually sent to them in August. Drawings of the various types of locomotives and rolling-stock recommended were attached, but without prices. Estimates of the cost of the locomotives had, however, been furnished to the Persian Government in 1932 (see paragraph 238 of 1932 report). Detailed lists of supplementary equipment were also furnished on this occasion. The covering letter indicated that the contract could only be put into force when an agreement had been reached for the transfer of the railway. 297. The Minister of Communications, in reply, repeated in writing a request that he had already made orally more than once that the transfer of the railway should be effected without further delay and without regard for political difficulties. 297a. It was evident that if the railway were to remain as an item in the general treaty it would be impossible to insist on the extensive commercial concessions which the Government of India desired as a pre-condition of a “commercial” settlement. But the eagerness of the Persian Government to have it reopened added to its value as a bargaining factor. After reviewing the whole situation, His Majesty’s Government decided in September that the Persian Government should, if necessary, be told that the suggestion that the railway should be transferred apart from the general treaty could not be accepted. Zahedan Vice-Consulate. 298. In May the Persian Government complained to His Majesty’s Legation that a muzzle-loading gun belonging to the Persian army, which had been brought to Zahedan from Zabul in order to be fired at sunset and sunrise during Ramazan, had been found to be missing one evening. It had, however, been tracked to the British vice-consulate and recovered by the military authorities after a request by the vice-consul to be allowed to keep it had been refused. On enquiries being made, it appeared that the gun in question consisted of the barrel of an ancient cannon; it had lain in the desert near the vice-consulate for anything up to twelve years and could not possibly have been fired by anyone. The vice-consul, thinking that it would decorate his garden, in which nothing less hardy than bronze would stand the Zahedan summer, had, with the permission of the Governor of Zahedan, had it placed in front of his house. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires protested strongly against the transmission of such frivolous reports.47 299. On another occasion customs guards entered the servants’ quarters of the vice-consulate and found a bag of smuggled sugar. The servant concerned was dismissed by the vice-consul, who only learnt of the search after it had taKen place. A protest was made later by His Majesty’s Legation against the fact that the search had been carried out without the permission of the vice-consul haying previously been obtained and without a search warrant from a competent judicial authority. (C) A nglo-Persian Oil Company. 300. On the 27th November, 1932, the Persian Government cancelled the D’Arcy Concession. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom brought the dispute which then arose between themselves and the Persian Government to the notice of the League of Nations, and at a meeting of the Council of the League on the 19th December it was decided that the question should be placed upon the agenda of the session beginning on the 23rd January, 1933, in order to give the Persian Government time to prepare their case. 301 During the interval an exchange of views took place between the Foreign’Office and His Majesty’s Minister as to the desirability of asking the Persian Government, in advance of the hearing before the League, to subscribe to a formula which would enable them to embark upon direct negotiations with the company for a new concession and at the same time leave the two Governments free to pursue their respective cases before the League if the negotiations failed, it was decided, however, that any action of this nature had better be left until the two sides had met at Geneva. The main object of His Majesty’s Government both then and later, was to ensure that the dispute should not be taken out of the hands of the League until a new agreement had been reached and put into operation. 302 The Persian reply to the memorandum which His Majesty’s Govern ment had submitted to the League on the 16th December reached the Secretary- General on the 18th January. The first part contained a number of random accusations against the company about such matters as the amount of royalty paid by them in former years, their alleged refusal to submit certain former disputes to arbitration, &amp;c. It denied the validity of the Armytage-Smith Agreement, and ‘mve a misleading account of the negotiations which had preceded the cancellation of the concession. It then developed the main Persian argument, which was that the companv had not exhausted their legal remedies in Persia, and that, in consequence' the dispute lacked an international character and was outside the province of the League. 303 In view of this argument it was clearly of great importance to determine whether the cancellation of the concession had been an act of sovereignty, and whether the resolution of the Majlis of the 1st Decembei had been an act of legislation which would be binding upon the Persian courts or merely a vote of confidence in the Government. The question was carefully investigated by His Majesty’s Legation and, later, by Dr. Idelson the international lawyer who accompanied the Company’s representatives to Iehram The view that the resolution had legislative effect was supported by the fact' that it had received the Royal assent and had been published as a legislative decision in the Official Gazette of the Ministry of Justice. On the other hand, the normal parliamenary procedure for the introduction of a Bill had not been followed. Upon the whole it seemed that a convincing counter-case could be made out if the Persian Government attempted to argue that the Persian courts would be free to deliver an independent judgment upon the legality of the cancellation. 304. The Persian Government were represented at Geneva by Mirza Ah Akbar Khan Davar, the Minister of Justice, and Mirza Hussein Khan Ala, formerly Minister in Paris, as well as by Mirza Anushirvan Khan Sepahbodi, then Minister to Switzerland and permanent representative at the League of Nations. The United Kingdom delegation was assisted by Sir John Cadman, Dr. Idelson and various of the company’s officials. 305 The question was placed upon the agenda for the 24th January, when M. Benes, the representative of Czechoslovakia, was appointed rapporteur, and the 26th January was fixed as the date for the main hearing.48 306. On the 26th January, accordingly, the Secretary of State made a long speech controverting all the points in the Persian memorandum and exposing its numerous misstatements. He also asserted that no remedy was open to the company in the Persian courts, seeing that the cancellation had become part of the law of Persia, while the act of cancellation had destroyed not only the concession itself, but also that clause of the concession which provided for arbitration , thereby depriving the company of their normal means of redress. Dayar, in reply, reverted to various points in the memorandum submitted by His Majesty’s Government and repeated that the company should have had recourse to the Persian courts. He also made further misstatements about the company’s conduct in the past, which the Secretary of State subsequently disposed of without difficulty. He made no reference to the possibility of conciliation, and did not withdraw his challenge to the competence of the Council to deal with the dispute. At the conclusion of the speeches M. Benes asked for time to consider his report. The day’s proceedings completely changed the atmosphere in the Council Chamber, which had hitherto been hostile to our case. 307. During the following days M. Benes was busily engaged with the representatives of both sides in an effort to find a formula which would allow direct negotiation to proceed under the ultimate control of the Council. After much argument, the Persian representatives agreed on the 31st January to a suitable formula, and the formula, of which the text was as follows, was approved by the Council on the 3rd February :— “ (1) The two parties agree to suspend all proceedings before the Council until the session of May 1933, with the option of prolonging, if necessary, this time-limit by common agreement. “ (2) The two parties agree that the company should immediately enter into negotiations with the Persian Government, the respective legal points of view being entirely reserved. “ (3) The two parties agree that the legal standpoint of each of them, as stated before the Council in their memoranda and in their verbal statements, remains entirely reserved. If the negotiations for the new concession remain without result, the question will come back before the Council, before which each party remains free to resume the defence of its case. ‘ ‘ (4) In accordance with the assurance given by the Persian Government in its telegram of the 19th December, 1932, to the President of the Council, it is understood that, while negotiations are proceeding and until the final settlement of the question, the work and operations of the company in Persia will continue to be carried on as they were carried on before the 27th November, 1932.” 308. The only important point of procedure not laid down in the formula was the place where the negotiations were to take place. M. Benes hoped at one time that the Persian representatives would accept a neutral capital like Prague, where he himself would be accessible to both parties. But it soon became apparent that the Persian Government would only agree under the strongest pressure to the negotiations taking place outside Tehran. In addition, His Majesty’s Minister and the company themselves came round to the opinion that the best hope of success for the negotiations lay in their being conducted under the immediate supervision of the Shah. 309. By about the 13th February the company had decided to send their representatives to Tehran. Before this a number of meetings had taken place at Geneva and Paris between the Persian representatives and officials of the company. The result of these meetings was quite inconclusive, as the Persians clearly had neither the authority nor the knowledge necessary for the negotiation of a new agreement. Such as they were, the discussions centred around a statement setting forth under ten headings the requirements of the Persian Government in the matter of profits, control, &amp;c., which were so vague that neither the company’s officials nor the Persians themselves could understand them. 310. On the 19th February His Majesty’s Minister was received in audience by the Shah on the occasion of the departure of the military attache. The oil dispute was discussed, and His Majesty’s Minister formed the impression that as a result of this discussion the Shah had begun to realise that the attitude adopted49 [10152] E by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom when the concession was cancelled had some justification. His Majesty’s Minister further considered that if a memorandum setting forth the legal basis of the company’s case were communicated to the Shah, this would, by bringing him to a full sense of realities, increase the chances of a satisfactory issue to the negotiations. The Foreign Office preferred, however, to leave it to the generosity of the terms which the company were known to be prepared to offer to achieve the same result. 311. Sir John Cadman, together with.Mr. Fraser, the vice-chairman, and Dr. Young, the company’s principal medical officer, who possessed an intimate acquaintance with the company’s political affairs, arrived in Tehran on the 3rd April, various assistants and experts, including Dr. Idelson, having arrived a few days earlier. A number of foreign jurists and other experts engaged by the Persian Government also reached Tehran at this time, but they took no part in the subsequent negotiations. 312. Sir John Cadman had an audience of the Shah on the 11th April, but otherwise kept in the background during the early stages, the negotiations being conducted by Mr. Fraser with the assistance of Mr. Jacks, the resident director. The Persian negotiators were Mirza Seyyid Hassan Khan Taqizadeh, the Minister of Finance, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Davar and Ala. Serious negotiations began on the 13th April, when sixteen of the clauses of the Persian draft proposals were communicated to the company’s representatives. Mr. Fraser declined to discuss these proposals until the whole of the Persian desiderata were before him, and on the 17th April the remaining clauses were produced. On the following day Mr. Fraser subjected all these proposals to a devastating criticism, and on the 21st April he sent to the Minister of Finance a draft counter-agreement which he invited the Persian Government to accept. The Persian representatives declared this draft to be quite unacceptable, and it was decided on the 23rd April to tell the press that the negotiations had failed, a farewell audience being at the same time arranged for Sir John Cadman for the following morning. 313. At this audience Sir John Cadman convinced the Shah that no oil company could possibly exploit the oil-fields on the basis of the Persian proposals. The Shah for his part treated the impending departure of the company’s repre sentatives as a joke, and undertook, at Sir John Cadman’s suggestion, to attend in person a meeting between the British and Persian negotiators. 314. When this meeting took place on the afternoon of the following day (the 25th April) the Shah consigned the Persian proposals to the waste-paper basket, lectured his bewildered Ministers on the need for statesmanship and broad views in the conduct of the negotiations, and accepted the company’s draft on all essential points. 315. The detailed drafting of the agreement took five more days, during which Sir John Cadman had a final audience of the Shah, who was leaving Tehran. The agreement was eventually signed at 2-20 a.m. on the 30th April. 316. The new agreement did away with the 16 per cent, royalty on profits, and substituted a royalty on production of 4s. per ton, with an annual minimum of £750,000. The Persian Government also became entitled to 20 per cent, of the profits remaining after a dividend of 5 per cent, had been paid upon the ordinary shares. Internal taxation was commuted for thirty years by additional royalties on production, with a minimum of £225,000 for the first fifteen years and £300,000 for the second fifteen. In addition, the company undertook to pay £1 million in settlement of all outstanding claims and to pay the royalties for 1931 and 1932 and internal taxation since the 30th March, 1930, on the basis of the new agreement. The company also undertook to exploit the part of the Naft Khaneh oil-field lying in Persia, to sell petrol within the country at minimum world prices and to reduce by progressive stages its non-Persian employees. The concession area was to be limited to 100,000 square miles in one or more areas to be selected by the company before the 31st December, 1938. The agreement was to be valid for sixty years, i.e., a prolongation of the D’Arcy Concession of thirty years.317. This agreement was regarded by both sides as a fair and equitable settlement; the company recognised that, although they had had to pay heavily for a settlement, the prospects of peaceful co-operation, together with the absence from the new concession of any points likely to lead to future dispute, was worth the cost; the Shah and the Persian public generally, though perhaps not all the members of the Government, recognised that Persia had made a good bargain. The Persian press, which had carried on a strenuous campaign against His Majesty’s Government and the company during the opening months of the year, welcomed the agreement, but without making any attempt to claim a Persian victory. Opinion in Persia was upon the whole endorsed by public opinion in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. It is worth noting that, in the opinion of the company’s local representatives, the only clause which contains the seeds of future trouble is that which provides for “ Persianisation.” 318. On the 26th May M. Benes told the Council of the League that he had heard from the two parties that a settlement had been reached, and asked to be given an opportunity of submitting a final report at the next ordinary session. The Council adopted this proposal. The Persian Government had, as a matter of fact, as M. Benes stated in his report, informed the Secretary-General direct on the 31st May that the dispute was over. They had, however, consented, when asked to do so, to act in concert with His Majesty’s Government in submitting the text of the agreement to the rapporteur, in accordance with the usual practice, as soon as it was ready. 319. The new concession passed its first reading in the Majlis on the 23rd May and its second on the 28th May. It received the Royal assent on the 29th May, and was published in the Official Gazette of the Ministry of Justice on the 6th July. The proceedings in the Majlis were devoid of interest, being mainly confined to points of detail and grammar in the text. 320. On the 6th June the company paid to the Persian Government (a) £1 million on account of outstanding claims; (b) £1,286,000 on account of extra royalty and taxation for the years 1930 and 1931; and (c) £1,502 000 as royalty and taxation for the year 1932. 321. The dispute was finally and officially terminated on the 12th October, when the Council of the League took note of a report by M. Benes, the relevant part of which ran as follows :— Since then (i.e., the 26th May) there has been another communication from the Persian Government, dated the 5th June (Document C 371 M 182 1933, VII), announcing that the Persian Parliament has ratified the new concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. ‘‘ The text of the new concession is appended to this report. , J n , T^ es ?- c i rcum stances, I am happy to say that the Council may take it that the dispute between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Imperial Government of Persia, which was brought before it last December, is now finally settled.” The Secretary of State and the Persian representative both made statements expressing the satisfaction of their Governments and their gratitude to the TCL'J) r pOTt6&gt;UT. 322 On the 21st October the registrar of the Permanent Court of Inter national Justice informed His Majesty’s Government that the court would be W1 .j the occasion arose, to undertake certain arbitration function^ conferred upon it by article 22 of the agreement.

Mirza Isa Khan Feyz was removed from the post of Imoerial Commissioner ,n London in December 1932, and died very shortly afterwards November 1933 SShar Khan Zannkafsh was appointed to succeed him ’ in(D) Imperial Airways. 325. The export of the stores mentioned in paragraph 282 of 1932 report eventually took place without any other condition than the payment of a large sum in respect of road tax upon the furniture exported from the rest-house at Task. 326. In April the Ministry for Foreign Affairs complained privately that Imperial Airways aeroplanes were regularly passing over Persian territory at Jask on their way up and down the coast. Instructions were accordingly given to the company’s pilots not to fly within 3 miles of the Persian coast, except when the safety of the aeroplane was involved. 327. From the discussions preceding the issue of these instructions, it appeared that there was no generally accepted right of innocent passage over, as well as through, territorial waters; but that, until the 20th April, 1934, when Persia’s membership of the International Air Navigation Convention came to an end, the company’s aeroplanes, like all British aeroplanes, enjoyed in theory the right of making occasional flights over Persian territory. 328. In May Imperial Airways approached His Majesty’s Government with a view to secure permission from the Persian Government for the use of the aerodrome at Jask in case of emergency. The reason for this request was that no suitable emergency landing-ground had yet been found on the eastern side of the Musandim peninsula, and that their aircraft occasionally encountered strong head winds on their westward flights, which made it very difficult to reach Sharjah from Gwadur without running short of petrol. His Majesty’s Govern ment in the United Kingdom considered, however, that it would be undesirable to suggest to the Persian Government that the company were not entirely independent of their goodwill in the operation of the Arab coast route, and that if an aeroplane were ever driven by stress of weather to make a forced landing on the Persian coast, the Persian Government could not, as a supposedly civilised Power, make difficulties. (E) Imperial Bank of Persia. Political. 329. It was generally supposed that, when the Anglo-Persian Oil Company dispute was settled, the Persian Government might make some attempt to modify the concession of the bank also, although, since the note issue had been withdrawn, there was little in the concession to excite the envy of the Government, except possibly the clauses exempting the bank from all forms of taxation and authorising them to engage in all forms of business (a provision invoked at the time of the exporters’ exchange dispute in 1931). 330. Viewed in this light a letter which the Administrator-General of Customs, acting on the instructions of the Minister of Finance, sent to the bank on the 11th May (eleven days after the signature of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s agreement), informing them that in future it would not be possible to exempt articles imported by them from the payment of customs duty, may have been a ballon d'essai, to be followed by further encroachments if it met with success. 331. The bank, in reply, quoted article 5 of their concession, which stated that they would be exempt from every kind of tax and duty. At the same time His Majesty’s Minister informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that this disregard of the bank’s rights was bound to create a deplorable impression in London, and pressed him to intervene with the Minister of Finance. These representations were repeated during the following days, and His Majesty’s Minister informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that if no satisfaction were obtained he would raise the question at an audience of the Shah, which had been fixed for the 3rd June. On the 1st June, however, the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed him that the instructions had been withdrawn. It is probable that the Minister of Finance was only induced to go back on his decision by fear of annoying the Shah with another dispute at a moment when he was particularly well disposed to His Majesty’s Government. [10152] '' E 24 332. In the letter in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Minister of the withdrawal of the instructions, he explained that the Persian Government did not question the validity of the bank’s concession, and that a question of interpretation and not of principle was involved. The views of the Government were further developed in a memorandum communicated privately to His Majesty’s Legation in July. This memorandum argued from the fact that the bank had in fact paid customs duty up to 1923, and from certain other references to taxation in the concession, that article 5 referred to internal taxes and duties only. It added that the Government, while reserving the right to reverse their decision at any future time, had decided not to collect customs duty for the present on the bank’s imports, in the hope that the bank would assist them in every way in matters relating to the interests of Persia, even when they were not expressly required to do so by the terms of their concession. 333. This may have been a hint that the Persian Government expected the bank to be conciliatory in another dispute then under discussion connected with the payment of United Kingdom income tax. The Government contended that the bank ought not to have deducted United Kingdom income tax from their net profits before paying to the Persian treasury the royalty of 6 per cent, on those profits to which they had been entitled up to 1930, when the note issue was withdrawn. They therefore claimed the payment of a sum equivalent to 6 per cent, on all sums paid by the bank as United Kingdom income tax from 1889 to 1930, except for those years when the minimum royalty of £4,000 had been paid. 334. The bank argued that the terms of the concession contemplated that they would be incorporated outside Persia, and that they could not be incorporated anywhere without paying the local taxes. Consequently, the payment of United Kingdom income tax was a normal banking charge, and, in fact, an inevitable pre-condition of their being able to earn any profits at all. The Persian Government had, furthermore, accepted the deduction of United Kingdom income tax for over forty years, and they could not raise the question at this late date. The bank’s counter-arguments were highly technical, but the bank were satisfied that their legal case was unassailable and were prepared to go to arbitration if necessary. 335. The exchange of views had begun with a letter from M. Clavier, the Belgian economic adviser, to the bank on the 5th April, 1932; this was followed by a memorandum from the bank, dated the 8th June, 1932. The Persian Government had taken a year to reply, and it was only on the 18th June that the Minister of 1 inance sent the bank a counter-memorandum; on the 28th November the bank furnished a reply to the counter-memorandum. 336. 1 he bank s difficulties over its holdings of foreign exchange are dealt with in paragraph 503. General. Zahedan in Persia, and at Bagdad, Basra and Bombay (F) Imperial and International Communications Company. Telegraphs Agreement53 340. On the 22nd April His Majesty’s Minister formally notified the Persian Government that the Imperial and International Communications Company had been nominated as their agent by the Governments of the United Kingdom and India for the purposes (the operation of the Gulf cables) contemplated in -article 4 of the agreement. Cable Ship. 341. The Persian Government were informed in November that the Lady Denison Pender would visit the Gulf during the winter, and asked to give facilities for parties to go ashore at the various cable stations. When informing His Majesty’s Legation that the necessary instructions had been given, the Persian Government added that no repairs were required to the Henjam-Bandar Abbas cable. Wireless Stations. 342. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs made private enquiries in April as to the possibility of securing the use of the station at Lingah in advance of the general treaty, but were not encouraged to pursue their enquiries. General. 343. In July the Persian Government complained that the telegraph station at Jask possessed a 4-inch muzzle-loading gun, and asked that it should be removed in accordance with the agreement about arms which was come to in 1932. The piece proved on enquiry to be an ancient and obsolete brass cannon. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs were informed privately that it was hoped no more would he heard of the matter. 344. On several occasions during the year His Majesty’s legation had occasion to complain that the customs authorities at Charbar were collecting duty on official stores imported by the company, in contravention of the terms of the Telegraphs Agreement of 1932. In December the Persian Government replied that tools and material were always admitted free, but that imports such as medicines did not fall within the scope of the agreement. As some doubt existed as to the exact nature of the stores which had so far been subjected to duty, enquiries were addressed to Charbar as a preliminary to further argument with the Persian Government. 345. In January the company instructed Dr. Naficy, the Tehran lawyer, to complete their registration under the company registration law, and this was duly completed. The Persian Government raised no difficulty on account of the delay. 346. In June His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires learned that the encroach ments by the local military authorities on the telegraphs concession at Jask, which had formed the subject of a protest to the Persian Government in 1932, were still continuing. A further preliminary protest was sent to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, while at the same time additional information was sought as to the geography of the concession. This information was received in December. It showed that the buildings which the military authorities were appropriating for their own use were part of the barracks formerly occupied by the Jask detachment and of no use to the telegraph officials. What the latter objected to was the presence of Persian soldiery in the middle of the concession, especially as the latter washed in their water tanks and were generally most unpleasant neighbours. The company agreed that an attempt might be made to reach a compromise on lines suggested by His Majesty’s Legation, whereby a part of the concession, including the buildings which the military authorities needed, would be surrendered in return for the building of a wall shutting off the telegraphs area from the military area. (G) Arclmology. 347. At the beginning of the year Sir Aurel Stein was travelling westwards along the coast from Bandar Abbas, having previously made his way southwards from Kerman. It was his intention to strike inland from Tahiri and travel through Laristan to Shiraz. At this point, however, the Persian Government seemed to have become suspicious of his movements, and instructions were issued that his [10152] E 3r ''i- V 54 journey in Fars was to be postponed for a year. Sir Aurel consequently came to Bushire, and after some difficulty permission was obtained for him in Maicn to make a restricted journey from Shiraz to Jahrum and Niriz. By this time the season was too far advanced, and Sir Aurel was obliged to return to India. 348. In June a further application was made for permission for Sir Aurel to make a journey through Fars and Laristan in the winter of 1933-34. Permission was given for a journey along a defined route in Fars, but not for Laristan. It seemed possible, however, that a journey through Laristan might be allowed when the time came, provided that all were then quiet. 349. Sir Aurel reached Shiraz on the 11th November, and set out on the 21st November, after failing, owing to the opposition of the general commanding the troops in Fars, to have his programme extended to cover Laristan. Further more, permission to visit the Darab district in Fars, which had been included in the authorised programme, was now withdrawn, at any rate for the time being. (H) Claims. General. 350. The dossiers relating to the claims of British subjects against the Persian Government were sent to the Foreign Office in February for expert examination. The approximate grand total of the scheduled claims amounted to between £600,000 and £700,000. 351. No progress was made with any of the claims in Tehran, although those of the Persian Railways Syndicate and the Persian Transport Company formed the subject of correspondence with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Commutation of Pensions. 352. After much correspondence the Ministry of Finance declared in February that as the Hon. L. H. Findley’s pension had been granted to him in virtue of a recognised contract (as physician to a former Shah), he was not obliged to commute it. But as the pension of Lady Houtum-Schindler (the widow of General Schindler, who for many years held important posts, including that of Treasurer-General, under the Persian Government) depended not on a contract, but on an administrative decision of insufficient constitutional validity, this pension had to be commuted at four times its annual value according to the law of May 1932. The money was eventually paid in November. (i) Consular. Consular Mails. 353. Considerable difficulties were encountered in arranging for the conveyance of consular mails to Bushire after Imperial Airways had ceased to go there, and between India and East Persia. 354. In the case of Bushire the difficulty arose from the refusal of the Persian Government to empower their consul at Basra, where the mail for Bushire was transferred from Imperial Airways to the captain of some British steamer, to visa “courier’s passports.” This meant that the “courier’s passports” had to be sent to the Persian Legation at Bagdad, but His Majesty’s Embassy were eventually successful in evolving a modus operandi by which the Persian Legation vised these “ courier’s passports ” without insisting that the name of the courier should be inserted in advance. Mails from Bushire presented no difficulty, as the Governor was empowered to give visas. 355. In East Persia the difficulty arose from the fact that the Persian authorities suddenly put a stop in April to the practice, unofficially approved by the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs in 1930, by which the different consulates sent their mail to each other and to the Indian exchange post office at Mirjawa by the hand of their own messengers. The present Minister of Posts and Telegraphs eventually agreed to issue instructions that if the consulates wished to despatch mail on days when no post was leaving they might take the packets, fully stamped, to the local post office, which would cancel the stamps and return the packet to theconsulate for despatch by their own messenger. In this way the consulates were able, by carefully avoiding post days, to continue their own courier system. 356. In the interval couriers’ visas were sometimes obtained from the local Governors, but this system proved very complicated in practice, and, apart from the restrictions which it imposed on the weight of mail carried (2 kilog. to or from each consulate by any one messenger), it had the disadvantages that the Persian authorities would not issue visas for couriers to carry mail between one consulate and another, but only between the consulates and the Legation or the Government of India, and that visas for the carriage of bags from the Govern ment of India, which went under special arrangements as far as the Indian exchange post office at Mirjawa, could only be obtained at Delhi or Simla. The ] problem of these incoming mails was still under discussion with the Ministry for ^ Foreign Affairs at the end of the year. Consular Reorganisation. 357. During the year arrangements were completed for the amalgamation of the Meshed and Sistan consular districts under a single consul-general for Khorasan, having his principal headquarters at Meshed, but spending the winter months at Zabul, with a vice-consul to assist him at Meshed and subordinate vice-consuls at Zabul, Birjand and Zahedan. It was also decided to confirm the arrangement which had been in force for the two previous years, by which the vice-consulate at Bandar Abbas was merged in the consulate at Kerman, the consul paying occasional visits to the coast. These amalgamation schemes had not been accepted by the Persian Government up to the end of the year. 358. The post of consul-general at Isfahan fell vacant in April, and was not filled pending the conclusion of arrangements for the abolition of the post and the amalgamation of the consular district with that of Shiraz. Nationality Law. 359. At the end of 1932 the Persian Government had promised to consider sympathetically petitions from British subjects and protected persons who had failed to renounce at the proper time the Persian nationality imposed upon them by the law and now wished to remedy the omission. It soon became apparent that they had either repented of this concession or had granted it with mental reservations. From all quarters, but particularly from Meshed and Charbar and from the Kurrami communities in the Caspian provinces, reports reached His Majesty’s Legation of pressure brought to bear on those who had, in accordance with this agreement, submitted petitions under article 13 of the law to the police for transmission to the Central Government. The pressure was sometimes mere persecution, but it generally took place under a faint colour of legality, in one of two main forms. 360. In the first place, the police used to insist upon all petitioners giving undertakings to dispose of any immovable property they might possess within one year of their petitions being accepted. This was in accordance with the provisions of article 13, but these provisions had clearly been framed to meet the quite different case of an ordinary Persian subject washing deliberately to acquire a new nationality. Moreover, if the present petitioners had taken steps to renounce their Persian nationality at the proper time no such undertakings would have been required of them. 361. In the second place, an even more serious condition wms imposed to the effect that those whose petitions were accepted would have to leave the country. 362. His Majesty’s Legation pointed out to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the intention underlying the agreement had been that those concerned should have a second chance, that is to say, be given a further period in which they might obtain the advantages which they could have obtained if they had been less stupid or ignorant when the law was first passed, and that if they were now to be forbidden to own immovable property, and a fortiori if they had to leave the country, they would clearly fail to obtain those advantages. The concession ceased to be a concession at all, and the Legation could only suppose that the Persian Government had either gone back on their w-ord or else staged an elaborate joke. [10152] E 456 363. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs explained in reply that the concession had never been intended to apply to persons of Asiatic race and of the Mahometan religion, but only to British subjects of European descent, among whom a few “ hard cases ” might be found. They expressed their inability to make any exception about the surrender of immovable property, and denied that any conditions were attached to the acceptance of petitions : all that happened was that the police, in the exercise of the discretion which they possessed regarding all foreigners, might in many cases think that a foreigner who deliberately cast aside Persian nationality was not a desirable person to have in Persia. Finally, they maintained that most of the persons who had submitted petitions had no connexion whatever with the homes of their ancestors, were completely identified with Persia and ought by all standards to be Persian subjects. 364. His Majesty’s Legation admitted that there might be some force in the last argument, but repeated that if these were the views of the Persian Government they should never have pretended to grant a concession. 365. This attitude forced His Majesty’s Legation to warn all petitioners in v July that the conditions with which the police had threatened them as regards their property and deportation were confirmed by the Central Government, and to suggest to them that they should consider carefully whether they would not serve their interests best by retaining Persian nationality. It was explained that their British nationality or protection would remain unaffected. 366. Many of those concerned declared that they would sooner leave the country than become Persian subjects, but it is probable that in the end most of them decided to remain. It proved impossible, however, to extract from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs any list showing the number of petitions received and the result of each, probably because the section dealing with the question was in such confusion that no list existed. 367. During August and September it appeared that the Kurrami communities, who are usually ignorant and thick-headed, had failed to understand the warning conveyed to them in July, and were still involved in numerous difficulties with the police. The oriental secretary in consequence made a special journey to the Caspian provinces to explain in effect that the Capitulations no longer existed and to compose as far as he could the difficulties with the local authorities, a task in which he was largely successful. (J) Debt. 368. On the 6th June the Persian Government received a windfall of some £3,500,000 from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. On the 7th June the Imperial Bank of Persia in London paid to the Treasury the sum of £490,000 in repayment of the pre-war debt. The Treasury receipt specified that the payment was for “ that part of the Persian debt to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India which was advanced in the years 1912, 1913 and 1914.” 369. Later the Imperial Bank of Persia, acting on behalf of the Persian Government, asked the Treasury for an assurance that the sum of £490,000 was a full and final settlement of the advances made in the years 1912 to 1914, and that henceforward there was no charge on the southern customs receipts in respect of either the principal or the interest of those advances. The Treasurv replv, dated the 1st July, gave the assurance required, but added that this assurance in no way affected the present position in respect of the assignment of the southern customs as security for other obligations of the Persian Government to His Majesty’s ^Government. This caveat was rendered necessary, first, by the fact that the floating advances which composed a large part of the war and post-war debt were secured on the southern customs, and, secondly, by the fact that part of the arrangement made in 1926 with Feroughi for the reduction of the debt to £2 million was that the security for its repavment was to ho tho southern customs or the revenue derived from oil in the south57 (K) Legation Property. 370. A strip of land about 10 yards wide on the south side of the town Legation was surrendered to the municipality during the summer for the purpose of street widening. By the terms of the agreement the municipality rebuilt the wall (in fact a larger and better wall) and relaid the pavement; they also paid for the land at the nominal rate of 25 rials a zar ordinarily paid to expropriated landowners. The sum thus realised was sufficient to cover the expense of rebuilding the only one of the Legation houses affected by the change. 371. In the meantime the municipality had, through the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, asked in a rather peremptory manner for the surrender of a similar strip on the west side of the Legation, which was also needed for street widening. The surrender of this strip would have involved the virtual rebuilding of the gate-house and the oriental secretary’s and military attache’s houses, and the municipality were told that the change could not possibly take place that summer and that His Majesty’s Government would be asked whether it could take place at all. 372. His Majesty’s Government decided that it would be undesirable to refuse altogether, especially if the street widening were a genuine attempt at improving the town; but that they had already surrendered enough land at a courtesy price, and that this time they would require the full market price of the land surrendered, about 110 rials a zar, as well as a sum large enough to cover all the rebuilding which would be involved. In addition, the municipality would have to rebuild the wall and relay the pavement. These terms had not been communicated to the municipality before the end of the year. 373. The German and Belgian Legations had previously been asked to surrender a strip about 7 yards wide on the front of their properties, both of which are situated on the other side of the street from His Majesty’s Legation. They replied that the surrender of a strip of any width would completely ruin their properties, the houses being built right up to the street, but that they would gladly move out altogether if the Persian Government would give them the money with which to secure suitable quarters elsewhere. The municipality thereupon abandoned the idea of widening that side of the street. (L) Missionaries. Church Missionary Society. 374. The number of boys enrolled in the middle school of the Stuart Memorial College was 137 in 1933, as compared with 166 in 1931, but there was a large increase in Persian boys as opposed to Armenians and others. The primary classes, for which the Ministry of Education had given special permission in 1932, had 82 boys, as compared with 92 in the former primary school. The school at Kerman had 15 boys in place of 26 in the middle school, and 24 boys in the primary classes in place of 115 in the former primary school. The girls’ school at Isfahan became a Persian private school under a Persian subject, so that, nominally, the girls’ school at Kerman is the only girls’ school remaining to the society, although their money continues to support those at Yezd and Isfahan, and the principal of the one at Shiraz receives a personal allowance from the society. The numbers in the Kerman girls’ school fell from about 160 to about 40 after the closing of the primary school. 375. In comparison with these figures, the pupils at all the American missionary schools combined fell from 1,022 in 1931 to 813 in 1933, so that they suffered less than the Church Missionary Society schools. The Soviet schools suffered the most, the number of Persian pupils having fallen from 160 in the middle schools in January 1932 to 36 in June 1933, quite apart from the loss of 358 Persian pupils from their primary schools. The Soviet primary schools have, however, sufficient pupils of Soviet nationality to enable them to keep open. No figures were available for the French missionary schools. 376. In December three Persian converts who had taken a prominent part in a church service at Kerman were summoned by the police and made to undertake not to preach against Islam. The police told them that preaching on behalf of&gt; wmm 58 any otlier religion would be a breach of this undertaking and might also be treated as an act of espionnage ! The mission also had trouble over the demands of the police for admission to the communion services, to which only confirmed members of the Church are admitted. The police argued that any gathering from which their officials were excluded was an illegal assembly, but Dr. Dodson, the senior medical missionary, later persuaded the chief of police not to press the point. Roman Catholic. 377. Two English Dominican Fathers, Father Rice and Father Blencowe, came out to Persia in the autumn with the intention of establishing a mission at Shiraz, where they hoped to get in touch with Persian dervishes. They took two bungalows in the former telegraphs compound and set to work, but just before the close of the year a report was received that they had met with some opposition and that their chapel had been closed. Their intention was to keep the mission, if they could, exclusively staffed by English priests. Father Rice, who was formerly in the Levant consular service, was attached to the Apostolic delegation in Tehran for some years previous to 1931. (M) Proceedings against British Subjects. General. 378. The following list is not exhaustive. Only those cases which present special features have been recorded. Mr. F. C. Deacon and Mr. G. F. Fiinde. 379. On the 9th November Mr. Deacon and Mr. Hinde, employees of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, visited a tanker lying at one of the jetties at Abadan. They came ashore after an interval and then went on board again. As they were coming ashore the second time, a customs official searched Mr. Deacon and found 500 cigarettes on his person. Another 500 cigarettes were found in Mr. Hinde's motor car on the jetty. The two employees admitted the charge of smuggling, and Mr. Deacon was fined 669 rials. 380. The customs authorities stated, in addition, that both Mr. Deacon and Mr. Hinde assaulted the man who made the search, and that, subsequently, while he was proceeding with them to customs headquarters, he was violently pushed from the step of Mr. Hinde’s motor car, on which he was riding, and left unconscious in the road. Mr. Deacon and Mr. Hinde denied all knowledge of these proceedings. It was understood that they would be brought to trial in due course. Mr. P. A. E. Penning. 381. Mr. Penning was again tried for issuing worthless cheques and condemned in June to four months’ imprisonment. On his release he was repatriated to the United Kingdom with funds left by the Indo-European Telegraph Company with His Majesty’s consulate in 1931 to cover his eventual passage home. Mr. Penning was the first European British subject in Persia to be condemned to imprisonment. Karim Dad and Sahib Jan. 382. In July 1932 two gatherers of asafoetida, named Karim Dad and Sahib Jan, both in very poor circumstances, were arrested at Zahedan on a charge of smuggling cloth. After they had been in prison at Birjand for six months, and then only as the result of constant complaints by His Majesty’s consular officers in East Persia and, later, by His Majesty’s Legation, Karim Dad was released without a charge being preferred. Sahib Jan, having been tried and sentenced to six months’ imprisonment, was released about the same time. His Majesty's Consul at Kermanshah. 383. The appeal of Reuben Lalezar was heard at Kermanshah on the 19th March. Dr. Naficy was present, and again used the line of argument set forth in paragraphs 535 and 536 of the 1932 annual report. The court held that, though consuls were not entitled to diplomatic privilege, actions performed by them in59 their official capacity and by the direction of their Governments could not be the subject of legal proceedings directed against them personally, but should be the subject of proceedings against the Government concerned through the diplomatic channel. In any case, a complaint about the acts of a former consul could not be preferred against his successor. The appeal was therefore dismissed. Reuben “Lalezar took no steps to appeal to the Court of Cassation. Mr. D. J. Lewis. 334. Mr. Lewis, an employee of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Abadan, ran over a Persian workman in January, and the workman subsequently died, after having refused, until it was too late, to have an operation to his leg as recommended by one of the company’s Persian doctors:* The coroner’s court brought in a verdict of manslaughter, and in’ September it was understood that Mr. Lewis would eventually be placed on trial. The father of the dead man, who was anxious for a settlement out of court, had meanwhile signed an official state ment absolving Mr. Lewis of all blame. T ; I Meso'potamia-Persia Corporation. 385. In 1931 a Bushire merchant named Kazeruni brought a suit in the courts against the corporation, as the agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company, for the price of 100 cases of opium, valued at about £22,000 and consigned to the Opium Monopoly at Dairen, which the steamship company had accepted for shipment to Dairen. The opium had, however, been transhipped at Hong Kong to a German steamer, which had later called at Shanghai, and while at Shanghai had been boarded by Chinese customs officials, who had seized and retained the whole of the opium. The corporation denied that they were responsible for the acts of the steamship company, but, after three hearings before the Court of Appeal in Shiraz and two hearings before the Court of Cassation, it was held that they might be responsible. The lower court at Bushire was consequently directed to try the main issue. 386. The case was heard in August, and in spite of the fact that the bill of lading had been issued in the name of the Bank of Taiwan and of other circum stances showing that Kazeruni had no title in the opium, a judgment was given against the corporation. At the hearing before the court of appeal at Shiraz on the 31st December, further evidence showing that Kazeruni and the Bank of Taiwan had been paid in full by the underwriters was produced, and the court allowed the appeal. Moses Joseph Rohekar. 387. As the result of constant pressure from His Majesty’s Leoation, Moses Joseph was sent back to Khuzistan in the spring and set at liberty the authorities having decided not to prosecute. Narain Singh. 388. Narain Singh, the seditionist, was sentenced to twelve months’ impi isonment in February for bribing a customs official at Zahedan, attempting to smuggle silver out of the country, and conspiring to tamper with the customs records. Nanak Singh and Gulab Singh received smaller sentences as accomplices. A fourth Indian, Chet Singh, was acquitted. Abdul Faiz, the Peisian director of customs at Zahedan, received twelve months’ imprisonment. Mr. G. S. Parsons. 389. On the 13th March Mr. Parsons, a chauffeur who had at one time been employed by the Shah, was arrested. After considerable difficulty His Majesty’s Legation learned that he was accused of espionage, and on the 6th May they secured permission for him to be visited by the Oriental Secretarv the same difficulties being encountered as in the case of Mr. Townshend-Smith (see paragraph 395). At this interview the examining magistrate admitted that Mr. Parsons had not been informed of the charges against him, as he should have been within twenty-four hours, although “he knew very well what they were.” Moreover, a request made by him to be allowed to see the British consul had never been transmitted. These and other irregularities were at once brought ■J60 to the personal notice of the Minister of Justice, with the result that, on the 15th May, Mr. Parsons was released on bail. 390. The Minister of Justice subsequently admitted that the charges against Mr. Parsons had no foundation, and that there had been serious delay in the examination of his case once he was under arrest. But his bail had still, not been removed at the end of the year. 391. The possibility of preferring a claim on behalf of Mr. Parsons for wrongful imprisonment was considered, but no suitable occasion for doing so presented itself. Mr. E. C. Shirley. 392. In August an Armenian acquaintance of Mr. Shirley, the military attache’s clerk, obtained a judgment in default for a small debt which he alleged Mr. Shirley owed him. The order of the court was sent to His Majesty’s Legation by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, with a request that the sum named in the order, which included various court fees, might be transmitted to the court. The order was returned with an intimation that no such proceedings could be recognised. The message added that His Majesty’s Legation were satisfied that the claim was a complete fabrication, and that they would furnish further details if so desired. No reply was received to this communication. Mr. W. Townshend-Smith. 393. On the 28th February six police officials in plain clothes visited the residence in Tehran of Mr. Townshend-Smith, the owner of a coal mine in the neighbourhood, seized his papers, and took him to police headquarters. Here he was told that he was suspected of smuggling gold out of the country. After some hours he was released, but was summoned for further investigation on several succeeding days. During his absences his house was again searched twice and his Persian wife cross-examined. A protest was addressed to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the 7th March against the entry of the police officials into the house without the production of a warrant from a competent judicial authority, and against the searching of the house in Mr. Townshend-Smith absence. 394. The reply of the Ministry, dated the 28th March, declared that Mr. Townshend-Smith was accused both of gold smuggling and of espionage, and that the proceedings of the police officials had been authorised in due course of law by the public prosecutor. The production of a warrant appeared from the reply to be unnecessary under the law, though necessary under the “ safeguards.” 395. On the 5th April Mr. Townshend-Smith was placed under arrest, and on the 10th April His Majesty’s Minister asked officially that arrangements should be made for him to be visited by the oriental secretary the following day The Ministry replied that arrangements would be made, but several days passed, and, in spite of constant reminders, no time for the visit was fixed. On the 13th April the Ministry stated that the public prosecutor could not authorise a visit until the enquiries were finished, which he hoped would be in three or four days’ time. A lengthy exchange of views on the meaning of “ Safeguard ” No. 7 then ensued, and finally, as the result of continuous pressure from His Majesty’s Minister, permission was given, on the 19th April, for a visit in three days’ time. 396. On the 5th May His Majesty’s Minister, who had been urging the Minister for Foreign Affairs to bring the enquiries to a finish, pointed out that Mr. Townshend-Smith had now been in prison for five weeks, that the original evidence must have been confirmed or disproved by that time, and that the only possible conclusion was that the police were keeping him in prison while they searched for fresh evidence. 397. For five more weeks constant efforts were made to expedite the examination, but, although the Minister of Justice was induced to give the case his serious personal attention, it was not until the 15th June that Mr. Townshend- Smith was released from prison.61 398. In the meantime, a further interview with the prisoner had disclosed the fact that, while he was on the whole well treated, inexcusable delays had taken place in the delivery of letters or messages sent by him to the Legation or his wife, while in some cases the messages had been suppressed altogether. It also appeared that, although he knew in a general way that he was accused of ^^espionage, he had never been told of the exact charge against him. 399. The possibility of Mr. Townshend-Smith’s release was first mooted by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs just after the exchange of Royal messages on the 3rd June. His view was that a public trial could not fail to harm the excellent relations then established between the two countries. At the same time he maintained that the Persian Government had conclusive proof of Mr. Townshend-Smith’s guilt, and could not possibly let him stay in- the country. He therefore proposed that Mr. Townshend-Smith should be released on the understanding that, after a sufficient interval for the disposal of his coal-mine, he would be deported. This scheme was approved by the Shah, and His Majesty’s Charg4 d’Affaires accepted it as the best solution in view of the fact that the Persian Government could not be relied upon to give Mr. Townshend-Smith a fair trial, and could in the last resort require any foreigner to leave the country if they so desired. 400. Once Mr. Townshend-Smith was at liberty, the efforts of His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires were directed, first, towards securing him an adequate interval for the settlement of his affairs, and, secondly, towards securing him some compensation for the loss of his coal-mine. The second demand was justified by the fact that, in the circumstances, he could obviously not find a purchaser who would pay anything like its proper price. But the Persian Government showed no disposition to buy the mine (which was regarded as one of the best in Persia), being doubtless confident that they would eventually secure it for nothing. 401. A series of short postponements were arranged, but, when the last of them expired in August, the police showed no sign of wishing to hasten Mr. Townshend-Smith’s departure. It subsequently transpired that he had been summoned to the headquarters of the secret police and to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and told that the Shah had granted him a free pardon. The exact reasons for this change of front were not apparent. Unfortunately, the change did not last long, for, on the 25th November, he was again summoned by the secret police, told that the Shah regarded him as a master spy, on the level of Colonel Lawrence, and ordered to leave the country in a month. A further short postponement was obtained, but at the end of the year his fate was still uncertain. V. —Internal Affairs (Political). (A) Court and Government. The Shah. 402. The Shah paid several visits to the Caspian provinces, but his only long journey was one through Azerbaijan, Kurdistan and Pusht-i-Kuh in the autumn. 403. Whether in his capital or on his travels, he showed himself more suspicious and worse tempered than ever before. The sections on Anglo-Persian relations and Basidu afford some indication of the ungovernable fury into which he allowed himself to fall at any slight, real or imaginary, to his personal position; and of the impossibility of conducting business with Ministers who went in physical terror of their hidden master. His everyday temper was little better. Stories had long been current that the Shah kicked his subjects freely when they displeased him, whether they were Ministers of State or scullions, but it was not until the spring of 1933 that the foreign community were privileged actually to see him do so. 404. The incident occurred at the races. A Persian officer and a Turcoman boy of about 16 were riding a close finish. During the last 150 yards the race took on the appearance of a bout of vigorous riding-off between two determined polo players, until finally the officer struck the Turcoman with his whip. The02 Turcoman struck back savagely, and was still slashing when they passed the winning-post. The young jockey was immediately hauled before the Shah, who, in the full view of the crowd, kicked him hard in the lower part of the stomach and ordered him to be belaboured by the soldiers who were holding him. It is only fair to record the sequel, which is, according to the common belief, that the Shah subsequently learned that the officer had been in the wrong and rewarded the_^ jockey with a present of 100 tomans. V ' 405. The Shah’s bad temper and his suspicious nature may both have been largely due to ill-health. It was commonly believed that he was suffering from some incurable complaint, possibly cancer, and rumours that he was on the point of leaving for Switzerland to consult a specialist cropped up from time to time. There was no doubt that the Shah was unwell on several occasions, nor that a journey to Switzerland, where the Valiahd was at school, was in contemplation. But no details were forthcoming until the autumn, when the Shah asked the King of Iraq whether it would be convenient for him to visit Bagdad in the spring of 1934 on his way to Turkey. From Turkey it was assumed that he would visit Switzerland and possibly other countries. 406. The Shah acquired new estates at Fariman, south-east of Meshed, from the heirs of Ain-ud-Dowleh, and roads, telegraphs and other amenities were at once provided for the favoured district. According to a reliable estimate, the Shah’s annual income from all his properties in 1932-33 was about 1 million tomans. 407. The Imperial prerogative was exercised in the case of certain gold plaques, recording the foundation of Persepolis, which were discovered by Professor Hertzfeld’s assistants during the year. Two of these were taken for the Shah’s private collection and the remaining two left for the new National Museum. 408. In spite of the Shah’s ill-health and megalomania, his powers showed no signs of failing, and fear of his displeasure continued to infuse life and energy, though not always intelligence or honesty, into every branch of the Administration. The Crown Prince. 409. According to his father, the Crown Prince made remarkable progress in his studies, being, in fact, top of a class of eighty boys. The appointment of Mirza Abul Hassan Khan Feroughi, the brother of the Prime Minister, as Minister to Switzerland, in spite of his lack of previous diplomatic experience, was probably due to the Shah’s desire to have a reliable guardian near his son. Ministry of Court. 410. No appointment was made in the room of Teymourtache, and the Shah’s private secretary, Mirza Yahya Khan Shukuh (Shukuh-ul-Mulk) acquired in consequence some added importance. He dealt with all internal matters, while Nizam Khan Qaraguzlu (Amir Nizam) dealt, as Grand Master of Ceremonies, with all matters affecting the foreign world generally. When the latter was ill during the summer his place was taken for a time by Ali Akbar Khan Bahman, formerly Minister in Brussels and later Director-General of Commerce. Teymourtache. 411. Abdul Hussein Khan Teymourtache was placed under domiciliary arrest on the 17th January and transferred to the prison at Qasr-i-Qajar on the 16th February, being immediately admitted to the prison hospital owing to the state of his heart. 412. The reasons for the Shah’s anger were the subject of continual speculation during the early months of the year. The theory that Teymourtache was being punished for his failure to settle the Anglo-Persian Oil Company dispute gradually lost the field, especially after the publication in February of the official charges, which were almost entirely concerned with his dealings with the National Bank. But these charges, though sufficiently scandalous, hardly accounted for the relentless animosity of the Shah towards his former favourite03 For this other explanations had to he found. The most probable was that there had been^ some sort of a plot (or that the Shah thought there had been a plot) between Teymourtache and the Soviet Government, possibly with the object of setting up a republic with Teymourtache at its head when the Shah died. The mere possibility that Teymourtache aspired to be more than the most powerful of Ministers*would be sufficient to wipe all other considerations from the mind of a ruler whose only fear was that he might die before his son was old enough to succeed him on the throne without an upheaval. 413. If this suspicion did not exist already, it must inevitably have been created by an article entitled “ Dropping the Pilot,” which appeared in the Times of the 9th January. This article stated that the Shah was growing old and was in poor health; the question of a regency must in the circumstances have often occupied his thoughts, and he must have concluded that his young son would stand little chance with a man like Teymourtache, ambitious and unscrupulous, at the head of affairs. 414. For about a fortnight before this article reached Tehran there had been persistent rumours that the Shah had received an appeal for mercy from the Valiahd, who was at school with Teymourtache’s son in Switzerland, and had decided to pardon Teymourtache and exile him to his estates in Khorasan. The rumours stopped soon afterwards, and the Minister of War, who himself was later to fall a victim of the Shah’s suspicion, believed that this article had sealed Teymourtache’s fate. 415. The trial took place on the 16th and 17th March before the court for the trial of Government servants. Teymourtache’s leading counsel, Shariatzadeh, was, according to his own story, “ obliged to withdraw from the defence ’ ’ a few days beforehand. The proceedings took place in camera. The prisoner was condemned to three years’ solitary confinement and the restitution of a sum of 200,000 rials on account of a bribery charge, and concurrently to two years’ correctional imprisonment and the restitution of sums of 385,020 rials and £1,712 on account of embezzlement (presumably irregular transactions with the National Bank). The bribery charge was said to have some connexion with the sale of shares in the Kevir Khourian Company, formed for the exploitation of the Semnan oil-field. Shariatzadeh, who is a reputable lawyer, maintained that the charges were pure fabrications, but this seems unlikely. Whether fabrications or not, they were not the real cause of Teymourtache’s punishment. 416. Teymourtache was tried again in June on a charge of having accepted a bribe of &lt;£9,000 and 200,000 rials from Haji Mirza Habibullah Khan Amin (Amin-ut-Tujjar), the holder of the Opium Monopoly Concession, as a reward for his help in securing the concession. The Haji was simultaneously accused of offering the bribe and defrauding the Opium Monopoly of 300,000 rials, feymourtache maintained that the sum in question, which was said to have changed hands as the result of a fictitious operation in exchange, was not a bribe but a loan, which he needed in view of his heavy debts and equally heavy expenses. He was, however, found guilty, and condemned to five years’ solitary imprison ment and to the restitution of the sums received. The Haji was found guilty of offering the bribe, but acquitted on the other charges. He received six months’ correctional imprisonment, but contrived to avoid serving his sentence. 417. Teymourtache did not apparently feel it worth his while to appeal against any of his sentences. 418. Even before his downfall Teymourtache’s health was known to be precarious, and, apart from this, it was taken for granted by the public that he would never leave prison alive. Rumours that he was dead were therefore constantly cropping up even before he really died, which was on the 3rd October. There is no reason to suppose that the Shah did more than assist the course of nature, but he seems to have done this fairly effectively, by forbidding during Teymourtache’s last illness the visits by members of his' family, which had previously been allowed, and by removing all the furniture, even 'including the bed, from the sick man’s cell. An official communique announced that he' had died of angina pectoris.Diba. 419. Abdul Hussein Khan Diba was condemned in March to ten months imprisonment on a charge of having received a sum of 2,000 tomans from a certain Amir Mansur on the understanding that he would secure the latter’s election as a member of the Majlis, without having any reasonable expectation of being able to carry out his undertaking. An intermediary named Mushar received four months. Diba’s sentence was, however, increased to eighteen months on appeal. Subsequently, Diba was sentenced to three months’ correctional imprisonment for libelling Seyyid Mehdi Khan Farrukh, the former Director-General of Industry, whom he had accused during the earlier trial of taking bribes from the Skoda Company. The Skoda Company also brought a suit for libel, but for some reason dropped it. Cabinet Reconstruction. 420. In January Mansur was transferred from the Ministry of the Interior to that of Roads and Communications, and was more fortunate than his immediate predecessors in holding the post, in spite of the Shah’s impatience at the slow progress made on the Chains road, for more than a few short months. The Ministry of the Interior was taken over by Mirza Ali Asghar Khan Zarinkafsh, afterwards Imperial Commissioner with the AngloJPersian Oil Company in London, as Acting Minister. Mirza Abdullah Khan Yassai, a follower of Teymourtache, was relieved of his post of Director-General of Commerce in May, and spent a few weeks in gaol. His offence is said to have been that he dared to object to the way in which the whole of the Shah’s rice-crop was sold to the Soviet Union without the interests of other landowners being considered. He was tried (for what is not clear), but eventually released without being sentenced. His place was taken on the 24th May by Mirza Humayun Khan Sayyah. Yahya Khan Qaraguzlu, after several false starts, finally abandoned the Ministry of Education in June, and his place was taken by an Acting Minister, Dr. Ahmed Khan Mohseni, Director of Education at Tabriz, who soon showed himself a martinet in his department. 421. On the 14th September it was announced that Feroughi had been made Prime Minister in the place of Mehdi Quli Khan Hedayat, A full list of the new Cabinet, which took office on the 17th September and remained unchanged, with one exception, until the end of the year, is given in paragraph 428. The former Prime Minister was appointed, after a short interval, to be Governor- General of Khorasan, a post for which his advanced age must have rendered him singularly unsuited. The appointment was subsequently cancelled before he had left Tehran. 422. The chief reasons for the reconstruction of the Cabinet were probably the desire of the Shah to have a real Prime Minister now that Teymourtache was no longer there to hold the threads of the civil administration, and his desire to get rid of Taqizadeh, whose triumph over Teymourtache, if it was a triumph, was of short duration. The exact reasons for the Shah’s discontent with Taqizadeh are uncertain, but it was said at the time to have some connexion with a scheme for the purchase of gold from abroad which has since been put into operation. It was even said that he had gone so far as to rally various Deputies in opposition to the proposals. On the other hand, Taqizadeh himself is believed to have wished to retire for some time, and as he was soon afterwards appointed to be Minister at Paris, the Shah’s displeasure cannot have been very great. Apart from the Prime Minister and Taqizadeh, the only important retirements were those of Mirza Farajullah Khan Bahrami from the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs, and of the Directors-General of Commerce and Industry. 423. The most notable newcomers were Kazemi at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and Ali Akbar Khan Bahman, until recently Minister at Brussels and later Acting Master of Ceremonies at the Court, at the Department of Commerce. 424. The retirement of Taqizadeh left Davar, who took his place at the Ministry of Finance, as the outstanding member of the Cabinet and probably the one with the most influence with the Shah after Feroughi. 425. The only change in the Cabinet before the end of the year was caused by the arrest of Sardar As’ad, a complete nonentity but an intimate companion05 of the Shah. Whatever the reasons for his arrest, which is dealt with in paragraph 446, they can have had nothing to do with his functions as Minister of War. Public Feeling. 426. Discontent was probably as general throughout the population as in the previous year, but it was rather less vocal, the reign of terror having silenced even the elements among the upper classes who formerly talked vague sedition. Although the restrictions on trade were slightly loosened during the autumn, the economic position of the individual citizen continued to be bad, and prices remained high. Moreover, although the individual citizen enjoyed more security than ever before, he also suffered to an increasing extent from the interference of the State in his every-day life, and in Persia State interference, still leads to abuses by the State’s officials. 427. But apart from tribal brigands, great and small, there was no open opposition to the government of the Shah. The arrest of the Bakhtiari Khans and of Kawam-ul-Mulk, and the murder of Soulet-ed-Dowleh (if he was murdered) may have been indications that the Shah was uneasy about his position, but they may equally well have been part of a deliberate plan to clear the poppy fields for the future. Other repressive measures, such as the constant arrest of persons accused of espionage and the execution of numerous alleged G.P.U. agents at Meshed in the summer, as well, perhaps, as the persecution of Teymourtache, were probably indications of a growing fear of foreign, and especially Soviet, influences and ideas, rather than of fear of indigenous treason. 428.

The following well-known Persians died during the year :— Haji Hussein Agha Amin-uz-Zarb. Haji Muhammad Ali Rais (Rais-ut-Tujjar), C.I.E. Mirza Sadiq Khan Akbar (Sardar Mu’tamid). Mirza Suleiman Khan Meykedeh. (C) Majlis. Elections. 437. The eighth Majlis came to an end on the 15th January, but it was not until the 15th March that a sufficiently large number of the new Deputies had reached Tehran to make the opening of the ninth Majlis possible. 438. The new Deputies were almost all the same people as the old ones, and as much as ever the puppets of the Shah. Nevertheless, they were often men of position and local influence, and as a body might prove capable, in the event of a demise of the Crown or some similar emergency, of ensuring that the Majlis was not an entirely negligible factor. Opening of the Ninth Majlis. 439. The Shah’s speech at the opening ceremony was chiefly notable for its insistence upon the need for rapid industrialisation, which was already being carried out at a pace which the country could hardly stand, and for a reference to a scheme for the division of the Crown lands. This scheme undoubtedly owed its inception to the Shah’s known desire to change the nomad tribesmen of the Empire into peaceful cultivators with all possible speed. A beginning had already been made in Sistan, where the lands of the Baluch Sardars had been divided among the peasantry. Large numbers of Lurs and Kurds had also been settled in distant parts of Persia. 440. Muhammad Hussein Khan Dadgar was again elected President of the Majlis. Legislation. 441. The following list of enactments is taken, in chronological order, from the Official Review of the Ministry of Justice. It includes only those enactments which are of general interest, and does not include certain laws alluded to elsewhere in this report:— (1) Law authorising the Ministry of Finance to assign to certain khans of the Shah-sevan tribe certain Government land in Azerbaijan.

Although there remained many areas in which insurgent leaders defied the troops sent against them with more or less impunity, none of these leaders was in any sense a danger to the stability of the Central Government, and although reports of raids and robberies came in regularly from all parts of the country, the year 1933 saw upon the whole an increase in security and an extension of the69 [10152] f 3 Government’s authority. The suppression or conciliation of the Lurs, in particular, rendered safe for travel the last of the great main roads of Persia, that from Tehran to Khuzistan. Bakhtiaris. 443. The economic condition of the tribes was reported during the year to be very bad. Heavy taxes were exacted with unfailing regularity, and the Khans, who were themselves in desperate financial straits, were unable to help their followers. For lack of money the flocks and crops were decreasing, and the introduction of conscription in the more accessible areas aided the process by creating a shortage of labour. 444. A further difficulty arose from the Shah’s desire to make the tribesmen settle in villages, and orders were in force at the beginning of the year which effectually interfered with their seasonal migrations. The Ilbeggi, Murteza Quli Khan, was able, however, to persuade the Shah that their settlement could only be effected slowly and with financial assistance from the State, and the orders were relaxed. A commission was sent instead to the Bakhtiari country to study building sites. 445. The visit of an Italian scientific expedition to the Bakhtiari mountains and the effect caused by subsequent articles in the European press has been described elsewhere (see paragraph 111). These articles were much resented by the Khans who had entertained the expedition, and when an application was made in September to the Minister of War, Jafar Quli Khan Asad (Sardar Asad), for introductions, such as he had given to all prospective visitors to the Bakhtiari country during recent years, for Mr. Watkinson, His Majesty’s consul at Ahwaz, he asked that the introductions should be obtained from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. He admitted that this attitude was partly due to the irritation of himself and other Bakhtiaris at the articles in the European press, but it is also possible that he already had some inkling that he and other Bakhtiari Khans had fallen under the suspicion of the Shah, more especially as the articles had said that large numbers of rebel tribesmen had been encountered by the expedition. 446. The blow fell two months later. On about the 28th November Sardar Asad was sent home under arrest from Mazanderan, where he had accompanied the Shah to the Turkoman races and had even distributed the prizes in the Shah’s name, and placed in the prison at Qasr-i-Qajar. Simultaneously, most of the other leading Bakhtiari Khans in the capital, to the number of about sixteen, were also arrested. The only exceptions were the Ilkhani, Lutf Ali Khan (Amir Mufakam) and two other elderly Khans, Ghulam Hussein Khan (Sardar Muhtashim) and Haji Khusrau Khan (Sardar Zafar). The Ilbeggi, Hormuz Khan (the head guard at the oil-fields), Khan Baba Khan and other Khans resident in the Bakhtiari country were not molested at the time. 447. The only official indication of the reason for these arrests was given by the Minister of the Interior when asking the Majlis to remove the parliamentary immunity of two of the Khans who happened to be Deputies. He said that certain persons, among them the two Deputies, had considered the security and development of the Pahlevi regime to be contrary to their personal interests and had been guilty of conduct detrimental to the interests of the State, which had necessitated strong Government action. 448. It is improbable that the easy-going Minister of War, who had nothing to gain by a change of regime, would have lent himself to any plot. Moreover, although the Khans may have disapproved of conscription and of compulsory settlement, it is improbable that they would ever have contemplated active resistance or that the disarmed tribesmen could have effectively supported them if they had done so. 449. There is reason to think that a letter writteu by Sardar Asad to a relation in the Bakhtiari country was intercepted by the Governor of Isfahan, and that some harmless phrase in this letter was interpreted as a proof of sedition. It is also possible that Sardar Asad may have been the victim of an intrigue by Murteza Quli Khan Samsam.450. A side issue of the Bakhtiari arrests was the arrest ot Ibiahim Khan Kawam (Kawam-ul-Mulk), the only reason for which can have been that he was, by the Shah’s own orders, on friendly terms with the Minister ol Wai and visited him frequently. 451. There was a little raiding on the Bakhtiari or Lynch during the year by Kuhgilu tribesmen. The Shah is known to have given orders in the summer that funds were to be provided at once for the work ol making this road lit for motor traffic. Baluchistan and the Sarhad. 452. The post of Civil Governor of Persian Baluchistan, which had been created in October 1932, was abolished in February 1933, and the province reverted to military rule. 453. Abdul Hussein Khan of Remishk remained at large throughout the year and gave much trouble from his mountain fastnesses. His family were sent to British territory early in the year. Some fighting against him took place in April, but without success. After that the heat compelled the troops to withdraw from the field. On the 8th July the commander of the Government troops met Abdul Hussein at Minab and tried to come to terms, but Abdul Hussein refused. Operations were expected to begin again in October, but no decisive results had been achieved before the end of the year. The Government plan is apparently to scatter small columns throughout Biaban and Bashakird in order to harry Abdul Hussein’s supporters and prevent him drawing upon the villages for supplies. The troops are perhaps about 2,000 in number. 454. Idu Khan, a Baluch Sardar who had given valuable assistance to the British forces which occupied East Persia during the war and, subsequently, to the Persian Government in their operations against Dost Muhammad, was arrested at the end of April with his brother, Lashgar Khan, and sent to Tehran, where he was still detained at the end of the year. The reasons for his arrest were obscure, but the local military authorities announced that he had concealed the fact that he had a large number of rifles in his possession, and that he had been responsible for the refusal of Jiand Khan (see below) to return to Persia. He was also accused, as a matter of course, of being a British agent (he received a pension for his services during the occupation). The real reason was probably to be found in the personal hostility of the general commanding the local troops. Idu Khan had been the right-hand man of the former general, Muhammad Khan, but the present general, who from the start set out to reverse the policy of his predecessor in all directions, had always treated him with disfavour. His rival, Habibullah Khan Reki, took the opportunity of his arrest to appropriate such of his property as had not been removed to British territory or taken by the Persian authorities. 455. The Persian authorities made many attempts to induce Sardar Jiand Khan Yarmuhammadzai to return to Persia from India. In October the Govern ment of India took security for the good behaviour of him and his family. 456. As the result of representations by His Majesty’s Legation, the Persian Government stated in January that Ali Mahomed and Nushirawan Baranzai might return to Persia in safety if they undertook to come straight to Tehran, where the question of their future maintenance would be considered. The Baranzais do not seem to have availed themselves of this offer. Fars. 457. Ali Khan Qashgai, the half-brother of Soulet-ud-Dowleh, was active in the Firuzabad district in the early months of the year. In February he surrounded the troops at Firuzabad itself, and the authorities were constrained to seek the aid of various Dashti and Dashtistani chiefs in their operations, including Hussein Rustam Tangistani, who was allowed to return home from Tehran for the purpose. In April 1,800 gendarmes were sent from Bushire to assist the troops, and a column of about 2,000 troops also took the field. In June Ali Khan suddenly disappeared from the fighting zone, while his followers, who had at one time been estimated at 15,000 men, scattered or gave themselves up. In the following month Ali Khan surrendered after his wife and children had been captured and after71 [10152] F 4 receiving the usual promise of a free pardon and an honourable reception by the Shah in Tehran. He reached the capital in due course, but was apparently still alive at the end of the year. An unconfirmed report stated that he had been granted a monthly allowance of 1,000 rials. 458. Soulet-ed-Dowleh (see paragraph 341 of 1932 report) died in prison in August, apparently of heat-stroke, which may or may not have been artificially engendered. It was believed at the time that he and his son were about to be released. His lands in Fars were later confiscated. His death had few repercussions among the Qashgai tribes. 459. Some of the Khamseh tribes were supposed to have given help to Ali Khan, but it is unlikely that this had any connexion with the arrest in November of Kawam-ul-Mulk, who at that time had no property in, or connexion with, the Province of Fars. 460. During the second half of the year security in the Shiraz district was very good, but in December the districts further south were sufficiently unsettled for a journey by Sir Aurel Stein to Darab and Lar to be vetoed by the local military authorities. Gulf Ports Area. 461. A son of Mustafa Khan, named Chiragh, returned to the Mekran coast from the south side of the Gulf in June and carried out a number of raids. 462. In March a German lady was assaulted by a Persian youth while walking near Bushire, and this was followed by an incident in which an English lady was stopped by some muleteers, who refused to let her go until her groom came up. These incidents, combined with the assault on Mr. Morton at Hen jam, caused much uneasiness among foreign residents in the Gulf Ports. Kurdistan. 463. Afrasiab Beg, a nephew of Jafar Sultan, began hostilities against the Persian troops in the Avroman and Zohab districts in December 1932. He was helped by Hameh Sultan, of the Wahid Begi, and his lieutenant, Sufi Yusuf Beg, their combined forces being estimated at about 800 men. Special troops were sent from Kermanshah and even from Tehran, but in spite of the issue from time to time of reports of military successes, neither the main body of the rebels nor any of their leaders, except a brother of Sufi Beg, were brought to book. During the early summer, in particular, they inflicted numerous casualties on the Govern ment troops, and their exploits included a raid on the Government Treasury at Paveh and the capture of 12,000 tomans in cash. Efforts were believed to have been made later to induce them to come to terms by means of offers of free pardons. But, although the rebels raided freely in their own district, and although acts of brigandage occurred at intervals m the Kermanshah region, the state of security upon the Kermanshah-Khaniqin road, and even upon the Kermanshah-Senneh- Tabriz road, was upon the whole very good. Luristan. 464. At the beginning of the year Yadullah Khan had at his disposal, according to some reports, a force of about 3,500 men, not all of them Lurs. Another &amp; party, under Ali Murad Khan, operated independently. As a rule Yadullah Khan confined his attention to the traffic on the Khorremabad road, but even so only about one lorry in twenty was held up, and the drivers were rarely injured. He was supposed to have offered to desist from brigandage and guarantee the safety of the road if all troops were withdrawn and an allowance of 50,000 rials a month were paid him. In January he captured a party of 120 soldiers, but the Government troops began to take active measures in February under Sepahbod Ahmed Agha Khan, who had about 15,000 men in Khorremabad. A number of successes followed, and in April Yadullah Khan capitulated and was sent to Tehran. In June the road was reported to be quite safe, and the Government were assisting the former outlaws to settle on lands provided by the State in the Khorremabad area. It would, however, be rash to assume that all risk of future trouble has been eliminated.n (E) Minorities. 465. Distrust of the minorities again seemed slightly on the increase. In the cosmopolitan atmosphere of Northern Tehran there were few signs of this tendency, apart from the issue of a police order, of which little notice was taken, that all shop signs, &amp;c., had to be displayed in the Persian language in future. ^ But from Azerbeijan, in particular, came reports of restrictions upon the^ performance of Armenian plays, and of other measures, such as a campaign against the use of Turki, designed to hasten the process of “ Persianisation.” 466. The Assyrians were viewed with increasing suspicion, partly no doubt on account of the troubles in Iraq. This suspicion manifested itself in the proposals made to the not unwilling Presbyterian mission that they should close their mission and schools at Rezaiyeh, and in many restrictions upon the move ments of Assyrians. 467. The anti-Jewish campaign in Nazi Germany found an approving echo in Persia, where there were signs of increasing anti-Jewish feeling, partly fostered by the highly Nationalist, though relatively unimportant, Iran-i-Bastan. But this feeling did not manifest itself in any serious form. 468. An example of anti-Christian feeling at Kerman has been recorded in the section on “ Missionaries.” (F) Qajar Family. 469. The instalment of the pension of Abul Path Mirza (Salar-ed-Dowleh) due on the 21st March was not paid at the proper time. After many reminders, the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that difficulties had arisen over the provision of funds for this pension, and that no payments whatever would be made in future; but that the instalment for the current six months would be paid from special funds in order to obviate any inconvenience that might arise from the lack of previous notice. O n the 6th September His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires informed the r' i 1S Tv? r *° r Forei S n A ft’ air s that, in view of the cessation of his pension, Abul lath Muza would naturally be absolved, with effect from thp pvnirv nf tVtA mn’ronf (G) Sheikh of Mohammerah. which., icgarueu tne agreement of August 1931 which made it clear that the as so much waste paper.73 475. A little later his confidential agent, Muhandis-ul-Mamalik, was told at the Ministry of Finance that all the lands in Khuzistan which the sheikh held under firmans, as well as all the lands which he had bought and which had been Crown lands (“ khaliseh ”) previously, were the property of the State and would be confiscated. All lands and properties which were being occupied by troops or Government Departments would be confiscated without compensation. Any other properties would be valued and their price deducted from the Ministry of Finance’s unpaid claim for arrears of taxes amounting to 4 million rials (see annual reports for 1924 and 1925). If the sheikh did not accept these proposals he would get nothing at all, and the claim would stand. Muhandis-ul-Mamalik asked that the proposals should be set down in writing, but this was refused. 476. Subsequently, notices were inserted in the Khuzistan newspapers stating, inter alia, that the sheikh had no rights on certain properties, and that any title deeds held from him were worthless. The sheikh then appointed a lawyer named Fazil-ul-Mulk to defend his claim to his properties in the tribunal of the Ministry of Finance, but the only result so far has been that he has had to pay 15,000 rials in stamp fees. 477. The sheikh was rendered practically penniless by these measures, and now relies entirely on the sums remitted to him from Basra on account of his properties in Iraq. 478. The Iraq Government continued to insist on levying Istihlak taxes on the produce of the sheikh’s properties in spite of the representations of His Majesty’s Embassy. VI.— Internal Affairs (Economic). (A) Finance. Budget 1933-34. 479. The budget for the Persian year 1312, ending the 20th March, 1934, was passed on the 21st April, 1933. Revenue and expenditure items this year are shown in rials only, whereas last year some revenue items were shown partly in rials and partly in sterling, and some expenditure itejns partly in rials and partly in pahlavis (gold pounds). An exact comparison of the two budgets is thus somewhat difficult. 480. The current budget provides for a revenue of 506,912,227 rials, and for expenditure amounting to 506,904,460 rials. 481. As compared with last year, revenue is higher by 85,500,000 rials, but from this increase must be deducted sterling revenue last year amounting to £787,000. The net increase in revenue, assuming the rate of exchange to be 80 rials to the pound sterling, is thus rather less than 22,500,000 rials. The principal increases in revenue were in respect of customs receipts (42 million rials); indirect taxes (9-5 million); concessions (9 million) and posts and telegraphs (4-5 million). Opium monopoly and tobacco monopoly receipts in rials were higher by 12 million rials and 8 million rials respectively, but from these increases must be deducted the sterling revenue under these heads last year, which amounted to £500,000 and £60,000 respectively. The yield from direct taxes is estimated at 2 million rials and £200,000 less than last year (say, a total decrease of 18 million rials), the yield of the tax on cultivated lands being lower by 15 million rials. Receipts from the Sugar and Match Monopoly are lower by 4-7 million rials, but as the operating expenses of this monopoly are reduced by oyer 29 million rials, the net revenue from this source is estimated at 72 million rials as compared with 47 million rials last year. Only a small proportion of the estimated income of 3 million rials from the working of the sugar factory at Kerej is likely to materialise. 482. Estimated expenditure is higher than last year by 85-5 million rials, but last year’s expenditure included items amounting to 40'7,176 pahlavis (gold pounds). The net increase in expenditure is thus about 22-6 million rials. The Ministry of War, with a vote of 183,729,980 rials, accounts for a little over 36 per cent, of the total expenditure. Increased expenditure is also estimated for road guards (4 -7 million rials), the Ministry of Interior (7 -5 million) and Ministry of■BP — 74 Justice (3*8 million). Expenditure in respect of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Public Instruction, and Posts and Telegraphs, was last year shown partly in rials and partly in pahlavis, but there is a net increase in terms of rials in connexion with each of these departments. Provision is made for the expenses of the Opium Monopoly (4-7 million rials) and of the Tobacco Monopoly (2 165 million). Large reductions are made in the budgets for the Ministry of Finance (approximately 12-8 million rials) and for the Department of Industry and Agriculture (7'1 million). The appropriation for the working of the sugar and match monopoly, as stated above, is reduced from 30 million rials to 790,000 rials. 483 A supplement published with the budget contains two important items : (1) The allocation from cash reserves of an unspecified sum in rials for the purchase of foreign exchange for Government requirements and for. the protection of foreign exchange rates from artificial fluctuations; and (2) the authorisation of the repayment to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom of the pre-war loans, amounting to £490,000. 484. The following important revenue items do not appear in the budget: Anglo-Persian Oil Company royalties, which are added to the Government foreign exchange reserves held abroad; that part of the road tax which is devoted directly to road construction and maintenance; and receipts from the Sugar and Tea Monopoly, which are paid into the railway fund. Financial Situation. 485. As has been indicated above, the annual budget gives no more than a partial insight into the finances of the Persian Government. Unfortunately, it is most difficult to fill in the missing parts of the picture, since the authorities are very reticent on the subject, and repeated reminders from His Majesty’s Legation have failed to elicit a reply to the standardised questions concerning revenue, expenditure, debts, &amp;c., required for the Stock Exchange Official Intelligence. 486. Last year an attempt was made to appraise the financial situation on the 20th December, 1932, but it is not possible with the meagre information on hand to make so detailed an estimate this year. From the Anglo-Persian Oil Company about £4,500,000 was received during 1933 in respect of royalties, taxation, and general settlement as a result of the revision of their concession. No credits were voted last year in respect of purchases of military supplies, and it is assumed that the appreciable purchases of military aircraft, mainly from the United Kingdom, were effected from the large appropriations made in 1932-33 shown in the annual report for 1932. Payments made or authorised during the year included £490,000 for repayment of the pre-war loans due to His Majesty’s Government, £400,000 on account of two new sugar factories ordered, £150,000 for the purchase of railway rolling-stock, and £100,000 as the first annual subsidy to industries established in Persia (vide “ Agriculture,” below). 487. If one may assume that no payments other than those mentioned were made, the Government’s holdings of foreign exchange abroad would show an increase of about £3,360,000. In view of the uncertainties of the foreign exchange market, the Government were naturally concerned to reduce as far as possible the risk of loss on these considerable holdings, and in the latter part of 1933 more than £2 million worth of gold was acquired in London and shipped to Persia. In view of the subsequent depreciation of sterling and appreciable increase in the price of gold, this would appear to have been a very wise and timely action on the part of the Persian Government. 488 Silver bullion to the value of £139,000 was also acquired in London for the purpose of providing additional cover for the note issue. 489. Fiom such knowledge as is available, it seems reasonable to assume that, as a result of the favourable financial results of the settlement of the dispute with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and of the increase in the gold reserve to about £3,400,000, the financial position of the Persian Government at the end of 1933 was appreciably stronger than at the same period of 1932.75 Railway Finance. 490. According to a publication in the local press of the 24th June, the total revenue collected by means of the Sugar and Tea Monopoly Tax since its inception (the 30th May, 1925), up to the 20th March, 1933, amounted to 579,841,090 rials. Expenditure amounted to 402,967,786 rials, of ^ which 366,420,732 rials for administration and construction of the North to South Railway. The balance in hand on the 21st March, 1933, was therefore 176,873,304 rials! 491. On the 24th April the Majlis discussed a Bill authorising a credit of 30 million rials to cover expenses on the railway during the two months ended the 21st May, 1933, and expenses on the cement factory during the year 1312 (ending the 20th March, 1934). 492. The Majlis passed on the 8th June a Bill authorising the Ministry of Finance to hold at the disposal of the Ministry of Roads and Communications the sum of 115 million rials for railway construction, and 60 million rials to pay for the balance due for the 600 Idiom, of rails and accessories purchased from the Soviets. 493. A further credit of 10 million rials was voted on the 9th July for the exploitation of the metalled sections of the railway during the last ten months of 1312, as well as for the installation of a plant in Mazanderan for tarring wooden sleepers. 494. A Bill was passed on the 1st October authorising the Ministry of Finance to credit the Sugar and Tea Monopoly Fund with the receipts obtained from the exploitation of the metalled sections of the railway. No details of these receipts are as yet available, and it is impossible to gauge to what extent the Sugar and Tea Monopoly Fund has benefited from the exploitation of the railway. His Majesty’s consul at Ahwaz, however, reported that the income of the Railway Exploitation Department for the month ending the 21st November last was said to be 700,000 rials, exclusive of payment for the transport of rails, cement, &amp;c., from Bandar Shahpur to Salehabad by the Kampsax Consortium. The bulk of the freight is undoubtedly made up of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s products, and so may be of a regular nature. On this basis, the income (presumably gross) of the southern section would be some 6,300,000 rials for the nine months ending the 21st December. The complete lack of any details regarding the northern section, and the meagre information from the south, make it impossible to hazard more than a very rough guess as to the state of the railway fund at the end of the year. 495. Information from a reliable source gives the amount paid out to contractors up to the end of 1933 as 72 million rials, presumably out of the credit opened on the 8th June of 115 million rials. If one may presume, perhaps optimistically, on the Sugar and Tea Monopoly Tax providing the usual income amounting to about 100 million rials per annum, the position at the end of 1933 may be somewhat as follows :— In 1,000 In 1,000 rials. rials. Balance at March 31, 1933 176,873 Expenditure from credit Sugar and tea tax for nine of June 8 ... ... 72,000 months ... ... ... 75,000 Credit of April 24 ... 30,000 Exploitation, south, nine Credit for rails and acces- months 6,300 sories 60,000 Exploitation, north, rough Credit for exploitation ... 10,000 estimate 3,000 Balance available ... ... 89,173 261,173 261,173 496. From the balance available there should presumably be deducted the sum of £150,000, which, according to the Iran of the 7th November, the Budget Commission decided to authorise the Ministry of Finance to hold at the disposal of the Ministry of Roads and Communications, out of the Sugar and Tea Monopoly revenues, for the purchase of railway trucks and locomotives.7() Financial A dvisers. 497. M. R. Lefebure arrived at Tehran in the autumn as assistant to M. Clavier, bringing the total number of Belgian advisers up to four. Currency. 498. No further steps have been taken to implement the amendment of March 1932 to the Gold Standard Law of March 1930. The pahlavi exists as a shadowy entity in Government accounts, and usually signifies 124 French francs, but no attempt has been made to attach the rial to this unit. The rial has a lower proportion of fine silver than the kran, which it has displaced, but is somewhat larger, and there is actually no difference in value between the two coins. 499. There was a steady increase in the number of notes put into circulation by the National Bank, the last available return showing 235 million rials on the 26th December, 1933. The minting of new silver coinage continues at a rate reported to be 150,000 rials daily, and at the end of the year 90 million rials, or more than 10 per cent, of the total silver coinage in circulation, had been issued. 500. During the latter part of the year the Persian Government acquired in London gold bullion to the value of over £2 million, and silver bullion valued at £139,000. The object of the gold purchases is understood to have been mainly to effect an insurance against depreciation of its considerable holdings abroad of foreign currencies, particularly sterling. It is understood that the Persian Government now hold in Tehran gold to the value of about £3,400,000 (taking the price at 130,9. per ounce, of which about £112,000 is held as cover against note issue. The purchase of silver bullion was made with the object of providing additional cover for note issue, and it is anticipated that a further increase in the issue of notes will shortly be effected. New notes up to the value of L000 rials have been received from the American Bank-Note Company, and have been put into circulation. 501. The gold surcharge for customs purposes was maintained at 160 per cent, throughout the year. Llis Majesty’s Legation again suggested an exchange of notes providing for a decrease (or increase) in the surcharge if at any time there was an increase (or decrease) of not less than 10 per cent, in the value of the rial in terms of gold pounds, but no reply was received from the Persian Government. Exchange. 502. Exchange on London, which was well over 100 rials to £1 at the beginning of the year, started a serious decline in April, when the United States of America abandoned the gold standard, and fell steadily to 82 rials at the end of May. On the 29th May the control of exporters’ exchange was raised by a decree of the Council of Ministers. It was anticipated that the abolition of this last restriction on dealing in foreign exchange would result in a decrease m the value of the rial in terms of foreign currencies, and the rate in fact fell to about 86, but the improvement was short-lived. One of the aims of the Foreign Trade Monopoly had been to improve the value of the rial, and, by drastic reduction of imports and bringing trade almost to a standstill, this aim had been lealised to the extent that the rial stood so high that it became more and more difficult to sell Persian products abroad. 503. An unfortunate inheritance after the freeing of exporters’ exchange was the large amount of this exchange, including about 1,500,000 United States dollars, which had accumulated at the banks on Government account, and whose value had considerably diminished as a result of the unexpected appreciation of the rial and the contemporaneous depreciation of the dollar. Various devices were considered by the Persian Government for ridding themselves without loss of this unwelcome hoard, and it was finally decided to make the importation of cars and lorries dependent on the purchase, by importers, of dollars at the gold rate (28- 28 rials), the actual rate having declined to about 16 to the dollar. Other imports were similarly made conditional on the purchase of foreign cm i encies other than dollars at the gold rate. This manoeuvre was only partly77 successful, since importers could not afford to lock up capital for indefinite periods in this way and immediately resold, at the free and much lower rate, the exchange acquired, thus creating an excessive supply of foreign exchange on the market and further depressing the rates. The motor industry was unfairly handicapped, to the detriment of the much-needed development of motor transport in the country, imports were further curtailed, and, at the end of the year, the unwelcome fund of exporters’ exchange held by the banks on Government account was only slightly diminished. Some anxiety was felt by the Imperial Bank of Persia, which, together with the National Bank, was still in possession of a considerable amount of this exchange at the end of the year, but an explicit guarantee against loss on this account was given by the Government. The latter are still faced with the predicament of either themselves bearing the loss or of finding other devices to pass it on to the trading community and eventually to the consumer. There was some improvement in the rates of exchange towards the end of the year, due largely to the considerably increased import quotas, but the rate on the 31st December was only 82-| rials to the £, as compared with over 100 until April. National Bank. 504. A new ££ conseil d’administration ” was formed at the National Bank in March, consisting of Mirza Hussein Khan Ala, C.M.G., Mirza Muhammad Ali Khan Farzin and Herr Walter Horschitz-Horst, the new German manager appointed by the Persian Government to replace Dr. Lindenblatt. 505. The annual report of the bank, together with the balance sheets for the two years 1310 and 1311 (the 21st March, 1931, to the 20th March, 1933), was submitted to the general meeting held on the 22nd October, 1933. The last balance sheet published was for the year 1309 (ending the 20th March, 1931). The report mentioned the fact that the balance sheet for 1310 is a corrected ope, the “ Conseil de Surveillance ” having felt misgivings as to the accuracy of the balance sheet submitted in Khordad 1311 (May-June 1932), under the direction of Dr. Lindenblatt. As a result of the irregularities committed by the latter, the working of the year 1310 showed a loss of 8,737,456-65 rials. This loss was passed to the debit of the Government in virtue of article 25 of the statutes of the bank, in a special account. According to a new article 26, approved at the general meeting held on the 15th October, 1933, this special account has to be liquidated by crediting it with 80 per cent, of future net profits. The gross profits for 1311, ending the 20th March, 1933, were shown as 5,898,367-90 rials, with net profit, after allowing for various reserves and writings off, of 2,392,849-75 rials. Of this amount, 1,914,279-85 rials was credited to the special Government account, 239,284 -95 rials placed to reserve and 239,264,-95 rials carried forward. A gricultural Bank. 506. The agricultural section of the National Bank of Persia was made a separate establishment in May, to work in future independently with its own capital. The Minister of Finance proposed in Parliament on the 1st June that the capital in shares should be fixed at 20 million rials (about £245,000 at the rate of exchange then ruling). A Government measure providing for an extension of the functions of this bank is referred to below in the section dealing with ££ Agriculture.” Road Tax. 507. The Road Tax Law passed by the Majlis on the 30th August, 1932, remained in force, with a few modifications published in the monthly customs’ bulletins. 508. The possibility of entering a formal protest against this tax as an infringement of the spirit of the exchange of notes attached to the Tariff Autonomy Treaty was again the subject of an exchange of views with the Foreign Office. After legal opinion had been obtained and the Board of Trade consulted, it was decided not to take immediate action. 509. Although dissatisfaction was natural and general, no serious complaints of discrimination were reported. The additional burden wasshouldered as passively as all the other existing difficulties put in the way of international trade and individual prosperity. (B) Trade. Trade in General (1933). 510. Many factors combined to render the state of trade during the year very dull and unsatisfactory. These included the restrictive nature of the trade monopoly laws, the continuance practically throughout the year of the Soviet- Persian trade dispute, and the decreased demand abroad for Persian products. In the northern provinces trade during the greater part of the year was practically at a standstill, but in the south a certain amount of activity developed with increased imports of sugar and cotton piece-goods to compensate for the decreased imports from the Soviet Union. 511. Transport suffered badly from the trade stagnation, rates falling to most unprofitable levels. Transport interests were suffering at the same time from the increased burden resulting from the saddling of imports of motor vehicles and accessories with the obligatory purchase of exporters’ exchange at artificial rates. There was, however, a noticeable improvement later in the year, when heavy imports of sugar from the south coincided with increased activity in railway construction. 512. Exports decreased considerably during the economic year ended the 22nd June, and in spite of the elaborate regulations of the foreign trade monopoly laws devised to ensure an approximate balance of trade, or even a favourable balance, there was, in fact, an adverse balance (excluding oil shipments) equivalent to over a million pounds sterling. The appreciation of the rial in terms of foreign currencies which set in at the end of April made it even more difficult to dispose of Persian produce abroad, notwithstanding an improvement in respect of some products, particularly cotton, wool and casings, and exports continued to decrease. The preliminary returns for the first three months of the current economic year (the 23rd June to the 22nd September, 1933) show that imports were valued at 142,280,000 rials, and exports—excluding oil shipments— at only 104,867,000 rials. 513. The monetary market was naturally affected by the trade stagnation, and bazaar rates for accommodation ranged from 15 per cent, to 25 per cent. Ihis tightness was also partly due to the lack of adequate currency in circulation, and to the fact that a large proportion of the currency available flowed away from the commercial centres to the more prosperous areas of the oil-fields and of railway construction. Steps were being taken towards the end of the year to remedy this situation by providing additional currency backing and increasing the amount of currency in circulation. 514. Considerable speculation took place in the purchase and sale of export certificates, this being almost the sole activity of many merchants who found ordinary trading unprofitable, the price of these certificates varied from a high level of 21 per cent, to a low level of 6 per cent., but its general trend during the year was downwards, the rate at the end of December being only about 12 per cent. This fall was unwelcome to the Government, since higher prices provided greater inducement to exporters, and there was talk of Government intervention to stabilise the price, or, alternatively, to reduce the amount of goods which could be imported against a given value of export certificates. Nothing had been done in this connexion by the end of the year. 515. Trade continued dull throughout the year, and rumours of monopolies in the earlier part of the year and expectations of Government action in the latter part created a sense of uncertainty which was increased by exchange fluctuations. In November the long-awaited Government action was forthcoming in the shape of a decree of the 14th November increasing the import quotas for the economic year June 1933 to June 1934 by more than 600 million rials, or more than 100 per cent. The principal increases were in respect of cotton goods (304 million rials), paper and cardboard (46 million), tea (40 million), and machinery and tools (35 million). Provision was also made for increased imports79 of formerly prohibited goods, against partial purchase of exporters’ exchange at official rates, and for their sale by merchants in their own shops, the Government depot established earlier in the year for selling these goods being closed down. Balance of Trade (1932-33). ^ 516. According to the preliminary and approximate figures published in the Persian customs bulletins, the balance of Persia’s international trade during the year ended the 20th June, 1933, as compared with the previous year, was as follows :— (In 1,000 rials and sterling.) — 1310-11 (1931-32). 1311-12 (1932-33). Increase or Decrease. Imports 669,220 (£7,887,102) 660,277 (£6,719,009) Per cent. - 1*3 — 14*8 Exports— General Oil 718,024 (£8,462,283) 1,017,948 (£11,997,037) 535,591 (£5,450,198) 1,133,662 (£11,536,196) - 25*4 - 35*6 •f 11*3 - 3*8 Total exports .. 1.735,973 (£20,459,320) 1,669,253 (£16,986,394) - 3*9, - 16*9 Total trade 2,405,193 (£28,346,422) 2,329,530 (£23,705,403) — 3*1 — 16*4 Excess of exports over imports, including oil shipments 1,066,753 (£12,572,218) 1,008,976 (£10,267,385) - 5*4 - 18*3 Trade balance, excluding oil shipments .. + 48,804 (£575,181) - 124,686 (£1,267,792) Rates of conversion : 1931-32 84-8.’) rials to the £. 1932-33 98*27 „ 517. The serious decline in exports, resulting in an adverse balance of nearly 125 million rials, when, as is customary in Persia, oil exports are disregarded, shows to what extent the trade monopoly laws failed in their principal object. As the general tendency is to over-estimate exports and undervalue imports, the actual adverse balance was probably considerably larger than is shown by the statistics. 518. The following figures, supplied confidentially by the Tehran office of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, show the activities of that company during the year ended March 1933. Comparative figures for the previous year are also given :— Non-dutiable imports ... Dutiable imports 1931-32. £ 478,229 563,851 1932-33. £ 331,149 76,509 Total imports Local expenditure 1,042,080 397,500 407,658 220,140 1,439,580 627,798 Royalties paid to Persian Government ... 1,095,874 2,004,483 Oil shipments (in tons)— Cargoes Bunkers 4,995,308-5 416,155-9 5,646,759-8 438,414-2 5,411,464-4 6,085,174-080 Imports. 519. Statistics compiled from the preliminary monthly reports, which will require adjustment when the annual Tableau general is published, show a considerable fall in imports from the Soviet Union as the result of the trade dispute, their percentage of the total trade dropping from 41 per cent, to about 25 per cent. Imports from the United Kingdom fell from 93 million rials to 79 million rials, or about 12 per cent, of total imports, whilst those from India fell more considerably from 110 million to 67 million rials. In the same period Japanese imports rose from approximately 25 million to 55 million rials. A considerable decrease in imports of cotton piece-goods was largely due to the shrinkage of Soviet trade. Soviet imports of cotton piece-goods declined from 124 million to 71 million rials, United Kingdom imports from 42 million to 30 million, and Indian imports from 33 million to 12 million rials. Japanese imports of these products increased from 19 million to 34 million rials, and Italian from 10 million to 14 million rials. Japan also deprived India of her preponderating share in the imports of cotton yarn, the Japanese imports being 4-7 million rials in 1931-32, and 16-8 million rials in 1932-33, and Indian imports 27 million rials in 1931-32 and 16 4 million rials in 1932-33. 520. Imports of woollen goods increased, Belgium, France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany all showing improvement on their last year’s figures. 521. The United States retained their position as the principal suppliers to the motor trade, but there was at the same time a distinct improvement in imports of cars and lorries from the United Kingdom. Exports. 522. Exports to the Soviet Union showed naturally a considerable decrease, her percentage of Persia’s exports falling from 37 per cent, to 19 per cent. There was a small decrease in exports to the United Kingdom, but the percentage was slightly larger at 12-9 per cent. Exports to India fell bv more than 50 per cent., and to Germany by nearly 36 per cent. The United States bought Persian produce to the value of 79 million rials, of which carpets alone accounted for almost 73 million rials. Exports to Japan amounted to only 6 million rials. 523. The Soviet Union continued the main buyer of raw cotton, though in vastly decreased amount, and smaller quantities were shipped to Hamburg and India. Towards the end of the economic year (June 1933) Japan entered the market as a buyer of cotton, and has since bought considerable quantities. Considerable efforts are being made by the Department of Commerce to extend Persia’s exports, and orders have been issued to the provinces to send to Tehran samples of commodities which may be exportable with improved treatment and good packing. Soviet-Persian Trading Relations. 524. Ihe manifestation of discontent with Soviet trading methods in Persia, which began with a boycott and picketing of Soviet trading concerns in Gdan m December 1932, rapidly extended throughout the country. Negotiations m Tehran with Soviet commercial representatives were unsuccessful, the Persian proposal to centralise all trading transactions in the hands of one organisation, probably the Iran Irading Corporation, being completely unacceptable to the Soviets. Beginning with the Tehran Chamber of Commerce, provincial chambers oi commeice and merchants, obviously directly inspired from official sources in lehian, sent m resolutions urging a boycott of Soviet trading concerns until their desiderata were obtained, and, at the same time, tentative negotiations were undertaken with Japanese concerns for the exchange of Persian raw cotton opium and other products for Japanese cotton piece-goods. 525. The Soviet Ambassador, M. Petrovsky, left in March on his transfer to Vienna, having failed to settle the dispute before his departure, and it was reported that he had insisted, as a preliminary to any negotiations, on the cassation of the boycott and the abandonment of the plan to set up a centralised office to deal with all Persian-Soviet trade. In April the situation became more acute, all negotiations appeared to be suspended, and the council of Persian81 chambers of commerce passed a resolution urging the Government to denounce the existing treaty with the Soviets. Meanwhile, the Soviets reacted strongly to the boycott by closing down or reducing to a minimum their trading establish ments in all parts of Persia, and by discontinuing purchases of Persian produce. The Soviet commercial representative, M. Shevtsoff, was recalled to Moscow in May. 526. As the dispute showed signs of being a protracted one, the Persian Government began to take energetic steps to diminish as far as possible its dependence on the Soviet Union both as a purchaser of Persian produce and as a supplier of necessities. Persian raw cotton was shipped in increasing quantities to Hamburg and India, and, with the subsequent Japanese boycott of Indian cotton, an important new outlet was found in Japan. Increased imports of Japanese cotton piece-goods arrived in the Persian markets and replaced or displaced the Soviet product, as well as making inroads into that of other competitors. Schemes for the erection of cotton mills in Persia came rapidly to fruition with Government encouragement, and valuable orders were placed with a British concern for the necessary equipment. Machinery for six new beet-sugar factories was ordered in Czechoslovakia, and large imports of sugar from non-Soviet sources were sanctioned via the southern ports. Prohibited goods of a cc luxury ” type were allowed to be imported against exports of rice, which had formerly found a market only in the Soviet Union, and there was even discussion, which came to no result, of awarding a monopoly of rice export to Dr. Friedlieb in exchange for a monopoly of importation of prohibited goods. 527. Persian dependence on transit through the Soviet Union was amply demonstrated by the successful Soviet insistence on the supply of the whole order for 600 kilom. of rail for the Persian railway, under threat of holding up all the supplies for the northern section of the railway if part of the order were given to any other country. At the same time, the transit charges through the Soviet Union on goods consigned to or from Russia were raised to prohibitive levels. This action stimulated new interest in Persia in the possibilities of the Rowanduz route from Tabriz to Mosul, on the improvement of which considerable work was carried out, and of the Trebizond route, the latter being, however, more dependent on adequate action being taken on the Turkish side of the frontier. Considerable quantities of petrol and kerosene were despatched during the summer via Rowanduz to Azerbaijan by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to relieve the shortage caused by the Persian-Soviet dispute, and trial consignments of carpets and other Persian produce for Europe were sent by both the Rowanduz and the Trebizond routes. It remains to be seen whether either of these routes can be economically developed when the Soviet route to Batoum is again open and competitive transit rates in force, but in the meantime the advantage to Persia of having alternative, even if not wholly satisfactory, routes available will no doubt be kept in view. Further confirmation of the advantages of proceeding with the construction of the new north-south railway will no doubt be derived by the Persians from the present situation. 528. There appears to have been no weakening of the Soviet attitude and no further negotiations, but at the beginning of August it was announced that, “ guided by the advice of the Imperial Government,” the Association of Tehran Merchants had decided to resume trading relations with Soviet commercial establishments. Similar advices were received from other parts of the country, and so the boycott was called off and the Soviets had won one of their two desiderata as a prelude to negotiations. The dispute was by no means settled, however, as not only were there few stocks of Soviet goods available for sale in Persia, but also no provision had been made in the Soviet import quotas for imports from Persia. 529. A new Soviet Ambassador, M. Pastukhof, was appointed to Tehran in August, and M. Shustak was appointed Soviet trade representative. At about the same time it was announced that Karakhan, Assistant Commissar for Foreign Affairs, would shortly visit Persia, and considerable hopes were built on a settlement which would result from this visit. The visit took place at the end of September and produced no immediate results, the official communique [10152] a82 published after his departure stating that: Concernant les questions commerciales et economiques, M. Karakhan a donne des promesses, but that detailed discussions had been left to the Soviet trade representative and the Persian Department of Commerce. 530. About the middle of November it became apparent that the situation was improving, as Soviet trading establishments again began to make purchases and rumours were current of negotiations for extensive purchases of rice m Gilan. Finally, on the 10th December it was announced that notes had been exchanged between M. Bahman, Director of the Department of Commerce, and the Soviet trade representative. Details of the notes were not given at the time, but it subsequently transpired that they provided for a mutual renunciation of claims. The Soviets were to purchase the available rice crops, paying 8 rials a pood for last year’s and 9 rials for this year’s crop, and the Persians undertook to purchase annually from the Soviet Union 40,000 tons of sugar for consumption m the northern provinces whilst reserving liberty to obtain their sugar requirements for the south from other sources. Information has also been received to the effect that the Persians have secured appreciable reductions on transit rates across the U.S.S.R., and also the useful concession by the latter country to pay cash for purchases made in Persia. It is evident that the agreement is only a partial one, and the Foreign Minister announced in the Majlis on the 17th December that negotiations were continuing in respect of economic and political questions still outstanding. 531. The causes of this dispute were outlined in last year’s annual report, and, in brief, lie in Persia’s desire to balance her trade with the Soviet I nion. The immediate result has been to curtail Persia’s exports to the Soviet Union almost to vanishing point and to reduce considerably her imports from that country. Both in amount and in proportion to total trade Persia was the loser, as Soviet retaliation for the Persian boycott was very severe. It is not improbable that any final agreement reached between the two countries will produce some sort of formula for an approximate balancing of trade, but it seems unlikely that the Soviets will now agree to the proposal for a centralised office in 4 ehran to regulate all trading transactions. Persia has learnt once again how dependent she is on the Soviet Union economically, and how expensive it is to quarrel with her. But in the process she has also discovered new markets for some of her products, alternative routes for some of her imports and exports, and has taken certain definite steps, in the creation and expansion of her sugar-producing and cotton industries, to reduce her dependence on the Soviet Union. Further progress along these lines seems likely in the future, perhaps together with an effort to establish more satisfactory economic relations with her Soviet neighbour. Japanese Trading Activities. 532. Profiting by the Russo-Persian dispute, the Japanese intensified their efforts to increase their sales on the Persian market, and achieved a considerable amount of success. The preliminary customs statistics for the year ended June 1933 show a very large increase in imports of Japanese piece-goods, and Japanese cotton yarn made very serious inroads into imports of Indian yarn. The Japanese competition was made more effective by their willingness to take Persian goods in exchange, and a large proportion of the Persian cotton crop was purchased for Japan. Wool, dried fruits and red oxide were also bought for Japanese account, and there was talk of a project for exporting Persian salt in quantity to Japan. Considerable attention is being devoted to trade with the southern ports, where United Kingdom and German interests have previously been dominant. Japanese ships made frequent visits to Gulf ports and Japanese agents were appointed there. Enquiries were made in Basra as to the feasibility of a regular service of Japanese ships to that port, whence both the Iraq and Persian markets could be served, but it is not known yet whether it was decided that the service would be profitable. 533. Customs statistics are not yet available to show the progress made by the Japanese during the latter half of last year, but it is believed to have been considerable. No longer confining themselves to cotton piece-goods and yarn, all kinds of commodities are now being offered. Cement reported to be of good quality is being delivered at the southern ports at prices which defy competition. * i 1 I « ‘83 apanese voiles are on sale here at prices said to be 50 per cent, less than the Manchester product of equivalent quality, and mercerised cotton is also offered at about half the price for United Kingdom goods. Cheap bicycles are being sold, and m Meshed ‘ Bridge Stone ” motor tyres of Japanese manufacture are being onered. Imports of tea have also been made from Japan. More recently ‘ l ^ em Pf s h av e been made to enter the market for chemicals and explosives at very low prices, and it remains to be seen whether inroads will be made into this market, which is at present shared mainly by United Kingdom and German interests. 534. Ihe extension of Japanese trade has been achieved as a result of continuous and ruthless price-cutting, a policy which has been unwelcome to .Persian merchants, who have incurred considerable losses as a result of deprecia- t J on of P 16 value their stocks. Improving commercial relations of Persia and the boviet union will no doubt signify an intensification of the competition for the Persian market, particularly in respect of cotton piece-goods, though it is doubtful whether even the Soviets can compete with the prices and qualities oliered by the Japanese. The outlook for Manchester goods in such circumstances is not very promising. Amendments to the Foreign Trade Monopoly Law. 535. The regulations implementing the Trade Monopoly (Amendment) Act of the 10th July, 1932, were eventually published at the end of February. The bulk of the regulations, comprising thirty-six articles, consisted chiefly of instructions to officials and the banks regarding the issue of import licences, valuation of merchandise and exchange transactions and accounts. There was an evident desire to speed up the issue of import licences, for which applications i an now be made without the interruptions caused by the &lt;£ close ’ ’ seasons formerly observed. Some licences were actually issued within ten days of application. ^ 536. Monopolistic possibilities still exist as no mention is made of any restrictions as to the proportion of particular import quotas that may be applied for by any party. 537. The bank guarantee clause, differently worded, again figured in the regulations, import licences being issuable against export undertakings on the part of one of the solvent banks. As no such guarantees were given, or likely to be given, by the banks, the continuance of this clause was an empty formality. 538. In the early spring certain prohibited goods were allowed to be imported against exports of rice, the object being to find an outlet for this commodity, whose natural market in the Soviet Union was closed as a result of the Perso-Soviet trade dispute. The price of a rice export certificate quickly rose to about 75 per cent, (the ordinary export certificate being at the time quoted at about 17 per cent.), but this fantastic price fell about 50 per cent, when the Government collected all prohibited goods into a central selling depot as a check to the contraband trade. Such goods were sold under control of the Government, who took 10 per cent, on all sales. Rice certificates were abolished in the autumn and m December the Government selling depot closed down, unsold goods bein^ returned to the original owners (against payment of 5 per cent, for expensesf who were allowed once more to sell them freely in their own shops. 539 In November the import quota list for the current economic year ending the 20th June, 1934, was more than doubled by the trebling of various quotas, the principal of which were cotton piece-goods, paper and machinery, and the doubling of others, including cars and lorries, tyres and tubes, and tea. ^a 1 in ?P ort list for goods previously prohibited was subsequently published. Applications for import licences for these goods were to be supported by certificates of export of Persian produce of equivalent value and by bank certihcates of the purchase of dollars from the authorised banks at the 'official rate ot 28-28 rials to the dollar (actual rate being about 16 rials to the dollar) to the value of 10 per cent, of the amount of the application. An exception was made m the case of cotton and wool mixtures with a wool content of not less than 50 per cent., m respect of which foreign exchange other than dollars had to be purchased at the official J ’ rates for the full amount of the application f 101 52] c l2 *84 541. The raising of the control of exporters’ exchange is reported undei the heading of “Exchange,” as also the attempts of the Government to iic themselves of foreign exchange accumulated as a result of the conti ol and since; depreciated. Import permits in respect of cars, lorries, tyres, tubes, leathei goods and woollens would only be granted on production of export certificates, accompanied by bank certificates to the effect that exporters exchange, at the previously fixed rates, had been purchased. This obligation was a serious handicap to the motor trade, and conferences and discussions between Iff 0 Department of Commerce and motor dealers were still continuing at the end of the year without any satisfactory result being arrived at. Some alleviation was, however, granted in the case of automobiles, which were to be valued by the Customs on invoice prices (c.i.f. port) converted into rials at the free rate of exchange for assessment purposes, instead of valuation at the wholesale selling prices. This appreciably reduced the amount of exporters’ exchange to be purchased and also the value of the export certificate to be produced. 542. During the year there were three successive Directors of the Depart ment of Commerce. Yassai was dismissed in May, supposedly on account of his failure to settle the Perso-Soviet trade dispute. Mirza Homayoun Khan Sayah, who replaced him, lost the post in the autumn when Mukhber-es-Saltaneh’s Cabinet resigned. The present incumbent, Mirza Ali Akbar Khan Bahman, was previously in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and recently Minister in Brussels. M ono'polies. 543. The activities of Dr. Friedlieb in conjunction with the Iran Trading Corporation received a check when Teymourtache was definitely put aside. Dr. Friedlieb informed Mr. Lingeman in March that he had abandoned all idea of obtaining import monopolies. He was, however, actively negotiating for a comprehensive tobacco monopoly and, in fact, some agreement appears to have been reached in June. Dr. Friedlieb, however, failed to convince his American supporters, in spite of a special trip to Europe in order the more easily to communicate his views and to ensure the forthcoming of the necessary capital. He subsequently returned, but obviously an unsuccessful negotiator deserted by all his former associates, who either left Persia or carried on their own businesses independently. 544. The Tobacco Monopoly in June invited proposals from other concerns. Dutch, German and French interests continued negotiations, but nothing was heard of any progress. 545. In September the Ministry of Finance sent a mission, under the leadership of Mirza Seyed Ali Khan Nassre, the Director of the Monopoly, to Europe, ostensibly to look into the tobacco question, but subsequent reports indicate that tobacco was not the real objective of the mission. 546. In December a Boumanian, M. Victor Kendler, representing the Societe europeenne d’Etudes et d’Entreprises of Paris, arrived at Tehran, and appears to have started negotiations for the Tobacco Monopoly—with what degree of success was not known at the end of the year. 547. Dr. Friedlieb remained at Tehran, possibly in the hope of obtaining something from the successful negotiators if the scheme ever materialised. 548. During the summer the Government were known to be again consideimg the possibilities of creating import monopolies of motor cars, lorries and tyies. This was in connexion with the schemes for disposin 0, of exporters’ exchange without loss, and would have involved such regulation of selling prices and dealeis piofits as would have been unacceptable to the latter. The monopoly proposals were later abandoned, and imports of these articles were made conditional on the purchase of exporters’ exchange at the “ official ” rates thus imposing a very heavy burden on the motor trade Iran Trading Corporation. n ^ rom ^ ts instigator and president, the late Minister of Gourt, naturally put a brake on the previously professed enthusiasm for this syndicate but it survived the adverse criticism which was evident early in the year, at which time its very existence appeared to be imperilled.85 550. The first balance sheet, published in July, showed net profits of some 700,000 rials, probably as a result of operations in sugar when the Government allowed the import of other than Soviet sugar, a certain quantity of which importation was effected by the corporation. Purchases of cotton, gum and dried fruit, and lending of money, probably to its own members, for trading purposes, appear to have been its principal activities apart from the sugar transactions. Negotiations were reported to have been in progress with exporters of silk cocoons, but no result has been made known. Incidentally, the Gilan cocoon dealers experienced a bad season, and stocks have apparently remained on hand and are deteriorating badly. (C) Industry and A aviculture. General. ^ 551. Persia is progressing, like many other Eastern countries, along the path of industrialisation, and her progress would undoubtedly be much faster if so much of her time and money were not devoted to the construction of the north- south railway. The urge to increasing self-sufficiency is intensified by growing nationalism and by the desire to be less dependent on the Soviet Union for manufactured goods, among which textiles and sugar predominate. A decision to advance annually £100,000 to assist recently-created industries is reported under the heading of “ Agriculture ” below. 552. Soap factories at Resht and Mian Pushteh started production during the year, with output capacities of 1,200 and 2,000 poods a month respectively. Other soap factories established within the last two years in Tehran, Tabriz, Kazyin and Meshed provide a large proportion of the local requirements. A tar making factory is being built at Tehran, and a plant for tarring railway sleepers at Khar Khoon in Mazanderan. His Majesty’s consul at Tabriz reported in December that a consignment of half-dressed skins prepared at the Khosrovy leather factory at Tabriz had been exported to New York, and also that a bale of socks manufactured in Tabriz had been exported to Iraq. A new boot and shoe factory at Tehran and a leather factory at Meshed started production during the year. A company was formed at Kerman for the erection of a wool and cotton carding mill, and the wool carding machinery was ordered from Germany. A small factory for producing gramophone records and buttons has been constructed in Tehran. Tobacco and cigarette factories are established at Resht and Isfahan, and it is reported that the tobacco industry provides employment for 15,000 persons. Tea production is being extended in Gilan and Lahijan, and’ an optimistic forecast, not likely to be realised, suggests that all Persia’s needs of tea will be satisfied within the country in five years’ time. Four additional tea drying plants have been established in Mazanderan. 553. A trial shipment of antimony from the neighbourhood of Isfahan was sent to Hamburg during the year. It was reported that the out-turn was satisfactory, averaging about 60 per cent., but that, with prevailing rates of exchange, shipments of this product could not be made at a profit. A report of the discovery of hard coal in the neighbourhood of Tehran has been made and if accurate, arrangements will no doubt be made for its exploitation to supply local requirements. A project is reported from Kerman to erect a plant foi the extraction of liquorice juice from the liquorice plant growing in the province. 554. Some extension was reported during the year of the Californian system of drying fruits, whereby it is hoped that Persian exports of dried fruits,' with improved quality, will be increased. 555. The pearl-fishing industry in the Persian Gulf was reported to be enjoying a good season. Textile Mills. 556 Considerable activity in the development of the cotton industry was shown during the year. A British firm (Messrs. Platt Brothers) secured orders U ?f, e ln lpmen J t , ° f th e s P in ning mills at Shiraz (5,200 spindles), Isfahan and Yezd (4,200 spindles each), and for supplementary machinery for the Shahi mills in Mazanderan, which have 11,000 spindles. The same firm were hopeful of [10152] G ,obtaining the contracts for the equipment of a mill at Bushire, as well as for one at Meshed, where a company is being formed by Meshed merchants m association with a Parsee group for the erection of a mill with 20,000 spindles and 672 looms. A cotton mill at Semnan is reported as intending to order, probably in the United Kingdom, an additional 1,000 spindles. This mill is equipped with second-hand British spindles, and the new order, if placed, would bring the number of spindles in use in Semnan to about 5,000. 557. A call for tenders for the erection of a cotton factory at Ashraf in Mazanderan for Government account was published in December. Ihis factory would include spinning, weaving and printing sections, and the value of the order would probably be at least £200,000. Some surprise has been expressed at the decision to instal the factory in Mazanderan, since the cotton grown in the neighbourhood of Veramin is said to be much superior, and it is not impossible that even at this stage there may be a change of plans. The former Director- General of the Department of Industry and Agriculture informed the commercial secretary that the Government intended eventually to erect eight factories of a similar type to that for which tenders were being invited. 558. Sentiment is at present strongly in favour of United Kingdom textile machinery, and it is to be hoped that this sentiment will be translated into further useful orders in the near future. The cotton goods which these new factories will produce will be of the cheaper varieties, and more likely to compete with Japanese or Soviet than with United Kingdom imports. 559. The jute mill at Resht, referred to in paragraph 470 of the report for 1932, has started production of high quality twine, and expects to achieve an output of 18 cwt. of twine per working day of ten hours. The forty looms with which it is equipped are capable of producing 2| million sacks a year. All the machinery for spinning and weaving is of British manufacture, and the factory is under the management of a British subject, a native of Dundee. Sugar Factories. 560. The Shah’s intention to instal more sugar factories (see paragraph 475 of the 1932 annual report) was substantiated in the spring, when a call for tenders for six new plants was published in the local press. The orders, as anticipated, went to Czechoslovakia, the contract, according to the local press, being signed with M. Chalupa, the director of Skoda, on the 27th April. 561. The cost of the six factories was stated to be 1,700,000 dollars, payable in six instalments, of which the first two, amounting to 420,000 dollars, were reported as having been paid by the 13th July. The last payment is to be made two years after all the factories will have commenced functioning. 562. The first two are already under construction, one near Shahi in Mazanderan, and the other at Veramin. The remaining four will probably be erected in Azerbaijan, Khorasan, Isfahan and Khuzistan. 563. The Government’s programme includes the construction of six more factories, so that by 1945 there should be fourteen in all, including the existing ones at Kerej and Kahrizak. ° &amp; o64 The wisdom of this extensive programme, as also the probability of its ever being carried out in its entirety, is open to question in view of the fact that the beet crops for the two existing factories at Kerei and Kahrizak were almost entirely destroyed by insect pests during the year. The Kerei factory is stated to have been engaged for only ten days on sugar production instead of the four months said to be normal, and, according to bazaar reports received at the commercial secretariat, there is no demand for the sugar now placed on the market A supply of vert de Paris ’’has been imported for combating the pests, and the Government are again considering the possibility of supplying a proportion of their sugar requirements by cane cultivation in suitable localities In the event of this possibility materialising, the factories now built or ordered wou d probably be useless, and new factories equipped to deal with sugar cane would have to be installed. G87 Cement Factory. 565. The cement factory a few miles south of Tehran was officially inaugurated by the Shah on the 29th December. The factory, it is stated, is capable of a daily output of 100 tons, which could be increased by the addition of one or two extra furnaces. 566. The machinery and tools were obtained from Denmark and Sweden, and the installation was effected by the Danish firm of Messrs. F. L. Schmidt and Co. Tehran Electric Power Scheme. 567. The agreement with the Societe de Traction et d’Electricite of Brussels, mentioned in paragraph 478 of the 1932 annual report, was never ratified. According to the Belgian Minister, one of the principal reasons was the fact that profits were cut down to so fine a point as to leave hardly any margin to cover unforeseen damage to expensive machinery. Much was written in the local press during the year urging the necessity of improving the town’s electric current, and in October a call for tenders for a central power plant was published. Tenders are to be examined on the 22nd January, 1934. So far as is known, no British firm submitted offers, but numerous tenders were submitted from foreign, including Soviet, concerns. 568. In the meantime, it was reported that the son of the late holder of the existing concession, Amin-i-Zarb, has purchased a 1,000-h.p. engine for lighting the northern section of Tehran, the plant to be installed just outside the old ramparts near the Gulhek Gate. The existing electric light, apart from being cut off at about midnight, is so poor and uncertain that it is hardly used in any private houses. A griculture. 569. At the end of the year a scheme for the sale of crown domain (“ khaliseh ”) lands in the villages and for the extension of the functions of the Agricultural Bank was approved by the Majlis. The proceeds of the sale, together with other credits amounting in all to 150 million rials, would be used by the Agricultural Bank for extending loans at a low rate of interest to cultivators. A condition of the loans would be the adoption by cultivators of more up-to-date agricultural methods. 570. It was decided at the same time to make an annual advance of £100,000 for subsidising industrial establishments recently created in the country. As a justification for this measure, it was stated that the existence of these industries was of great assistance to agriculture, from which it may be assumed that the industries in question are probably mainly the sugar beet and cotton industries, although others will no doubt receive consideration. 571. An acute shortage of wheat and barley occurred in Azerbaijan, the crops being considerably below average, and measures had to be taken by the authorities to control prices. There was also a shortage of wheat in Tehran, where it was rumoured that the erection of a grain mill and silo was under consideration. VII.— Opium. 572. Presumably on account of the small quantity of opium exported in 1932 and of the continual complaints against the high tax on exports of the product, the Government decided to grant some facilities to exporters. The local press of the 16th January published the decision of the Ministry of Finance to the following effect:— 573. The basic rate of taxation for a case, which was previously £83, was changed to 270 dollars, which at the rate then current reduced the sterling tax to £80. Reductions on the tax would be allowed on exports of over 100 cases at a time as follows :— 100 to 199 cases : Reduction of 10 dollars per case of 160 lb. 200 to 499 cases : Reduction of 25 dollars per case of 160 lb. 500 to 999 cases : Reduction of 50 dollars per case of 160 lb. 1,000 cases upwards : Reduction of 75 dollars per case of 160 lb. [10152] a 4—Bar 1 88 574. An additional incentive to export was later afforded by the ^ ecl sion to issue export certificates for the full value of opium exports, inelu mg e ax. In accordance with the regulations of the foreign trade monopoly law, certificates for only 55 per cent, of monopolised exports had been previously issued to Haji Amin Isfahani, who held the opium export monopoly until October 1362. 575. During the year shipments of opium for the Far East from Bushire amounted to 4,111 cases of 160 lb., of which no less than 3,^81 cases were shippe clandestinely, without licences, but apparently with the full knowledge or le Government. 576. Details of the shipments during the last three y ears are as follows :•— T . i Destination. Licensed— 1931. 1932. 1933. Bangkok 200 Batavia 100 Saigon 10 1,000 Macao 500 425 499 Formosa 200 150 Dairen 100 200 150 Keelung 181 Total licensed 1,110 1,775 830 Unlicensed 2,564 ... 3,281 Grand total 3,674 1,775 4,111 577. The area under cultivation last year was undoubtedly less than normal, reports from Isfahan, one of the principal opium-producing districts, giving the area planted as about one-third of normal. VIII. —Communications. (A) Aviation. Airwork (Limited). 578. Mr. Muntz made arrangements to come to Tehran in March with a view to obtaining permission for Iraq Airwork (Limited) to run an air service between Bagdad and Tehran. An accident to one of his aeroplanes in Iraq prevented this visit taking place. In August Iraq Airwork were reported to have every expectation of establishing a service between Bagdad and Tehran by the end of October, but no more was heard of it. The service was to have been bi-weekly and no subsidy was to be demanded from the Persian Government. Luft-Hansa. 579. A representative of Luft-Hansa came to Tehran in March to sign a contract for a new air service with the Persian Government, but some difficulty arose and he and Herr Weil returned to Germany in April. Later, the way seemed clear for an agreement by which Luft-Hansa should run a service to Tehran from Bagdad as part of a through service from Berlin. But this time difficulties occurred over the Turkish section, and there was no sign of the service being started at the end of the year. Private Civil Flights. 580. Permission was given for thirty-eight British civil flights along the south Persian coast, most of which took place. (B) Railways. Trans-Persian Railway. 581. Mr. Carroll, the American engineer in charge of the southern section of the railway, returned to Ahwaz in January after a brief visit to Tehran. According to the general report, the Shah had told him that no funds were available for further construction and that he must await the outcome of the89 Anglo-Persian Oil Company negotiations. Meanwhile, he was to reduce his staff and commitments. At the same time, it was announced that the existing railway would be handed over to the Government at the end of the year (z'.e., in March). 582. In March reports began to circulate that the northern and southern sections of the railway were both to be placed under the direction of Messrs. Nordquist and Holm, a Swedish firm, and that Mr. Carroll and M. Lindahl, a Swedish engineer in charge of the northern section, would leave when they took over. 583. These reports were soon confirmed, and on the 21st April the Minister of Communications signed a contract with the Kampsax consortium, combining the firms of Kampman, Saxild and Co. A.S., of Copenhagen, Nordquist and Holm A.B., of Trollhatten in Sweden, and Saabye and Lerche, of Copenhagen. Under this contract the consortium undertook to supervise the construction of the entire railway. For this service they were to receive an honorarium of 5 gold dollars for each metre of line. This honorarium was to cover their administrative expenses both in Persia and abroad, including salaries and wages, rent of buildings, &amp;c. The northern section of the railway, from Shahi to Tehran, an alignment of about 331 kilom., was to be completed in four years and the southern section, from Salehabad to Tehran, an alignment of about 770 kilom., in six years. For the purpose of actual construction, the railway was to be divided into a number of sections or lots, which would be put up to tender and awarded to suitable firms of contractors. The contracts would be signed by the consortium on behalf of the Ministry of Communications. The consortium would be responsible for seeing that the contracts were properly executed. 584. The Government were understood to have felt that the previous system, by which the two sections were being built as separate enterprises, was unscientific and wasteful. They may have also considered the schemes of Mr. Carroll to be too ambitious, although his estimates were smaller than any previous estimates. They evidently intended, however, to keep the ultimate control in their own hands, as it was laid down that all contracts were to be passed by a board on which the Ministry of Communications and the consortium would both be represented. They also retained the services of two Swedish engineers previously employed by them, as a check on the consortium. 585. The firms in the consortium had recently been engaged in railway construction in Turkey and their principal rival for the contract was the German firm of Julius Berger and Co., by whom the railway in lurkey was taken over. 586. M. Greenhut, the Persian Government’s Swiss railway adviser, left in the summer, but returned in December for a short visit. Before leaving he expressed the opinion that the consortium had made a good bargain, even though he had been instrumental in cutting their price from 6 gold dollars a metre to 5 gold dollars, but that the contract would not last simply because the Persian Government would find before the expiry of the six years that it would pay them better to cut the contract after a certain point in construction was reached and would then end it in the way that they ended every obligation that failed to suit them. 587. Mr. Carroll handed over the part of the southern railway already in operation to representatives of the Persian Government on the 21st March and the construction work to M. Blach, a Danish engineer, on the 30th May. Before leaving Persia he received a telegram from the Minister of Communications thanking him for his services to Persia, and it is probable that, if he had had any strong desire to remain, he could have done so, though in a much moie subordinate capacity. 588. The Kampsax consortium, of which M. Saxild is the director in Persia, having established themselves in well-appointed offices near the Shah’s palace, took over their duties on the 22nd May and in due course put various sections of the railway up to tender. The terms* of the contracts offered were, however, of a nature to deter many foreign firms, among whom only one British firm, Sir Lindsay Parkinson and Co., displayed any interest, and competition grew less and less keen.— 90 589. Towards the end of the year Persian firms had obtained the contracts for lots 1, 2 and 4 in the south, and an Italian firm (Angiolini-Balocca) the contract for lot 3, the four lots covering the section from kilometre 250 (Salehabad) to kilometre 340. The same Italian firm had obtained contracts for lots 6 and 7 in the north; another Italian firm, represented by a M. Pizzagalli, the contract for lot 8; yet another Italian firm (Mottura Zacchero, believed to be under the control of Angiolini-Balocca) the contracts for lots 9 and 10, and an Austrian firm (Briider Redlich) the contract for lot 11. A group of Swedish engineers, under M. Lindahl, had obtained separately a contract for the construction of four bridges. The Italian firms all quoted prices with which no other foreign firm could compete, and it was generally supposed that they were subsidised by their Government. 590. From the first there were reports that Kampsax found their task far from easy, and in July there were strong rumours that the contract would be cancelled. Even if the contract were ended, they should not lose very heavily, as they have sunk no great amount of capital in the country, and their administrative expenses have not been great owing to the fact that many of their staff had only to be brought from Turkey. Nevertheless, they may need all the help they can get from the new Danish Legation before their six years are finished. 591. A contract for the supply of 600 kilom. of rails, for both sections, was signed with the Soviet Union in April. The International Railmakers’ Association and other competitors were driven out of the business by the prohibitive freight rates which had been imposed just previously between Batoum and Bandar Shah, rendering it impossible for anyone but the Soviet authorities to deliver the material required for the northern section. Further more, the Soviet authorities insisted on supplying the requirements for the southern as well as the northern section, and threatened that otherwise they would not allow any rails for the northern section to reach Bandar Shah. The delivery of the rails from the Soviet Union began in the autumn 592. In October confirmation was received of the fact that the alignment of the railway between Burujird and Tehran had been altered so as to avoid Hamadan, and would pass by way of Sultanabad and Kum. The change seemed likely to render the construction of a line to Khanikin even more remote than before. 593. In the autumn the Anglo-Persian Oil Company arranged for Mr. Hall, an expert lent by the Great Western Railway, to visit Persia and give the Government a general report upon the railway and its requirements. As a result of this visit an order for three locomotives and sixty trucks was placed in the United Kingdom, with a possibility of further orders to follow. 594. At the end of the year the length of line in operation was the same as in 1932; from Bandar Shah to Shahi, about 127 kilom., and from Bandar Shahpur to Salehabad, about 250 kilom. 595. The question of the railway has been treated in some detail, for it is unquestionably the most important object in Persia to-day. An unbelievably large portion of the national wealth is expended upon it, so large that the payment of wages alone causes a constant shortage of silver currency in provinces other than Mazanderan and Khuzistan. The sight of so much money acts like a magnet to engineers and contractors, and the hotels and pensions of Tehran overflow with foreigners of all nationalities bent upon securing some portion of the pickings for themselves. The Scandinavian population alone has grown from about twenty to about 200, and there must, in addition, be scores of German, Italian and other engineers. If the railway is ever finished it will at least be a fine piece of engineering, and it is a pity that it will probably be quite useless. Other Railways. 596. ^ The remaining railways of Persia are of little interest. That from Julfa to labriz, with its branch from Sufian to Sherifkhaneh, continues an even, but not very active, career. Concern for its interest and those of the steamer service on Lake Rezaiyeh is believed to have held the Persian Government back91 ‘f t at one time from developing the section of the Rowanduz route between Tabriz and the southern port of Haidarabad to the full extent of their resources, but it is to be hoped that they have now passed this phase. The Zahedan Railway has been dealt with separately. The light railways from Tehran to Shah Abdul Azim and from Dar-i-Ghazineh to Masjid-i-Suleiman (the oilfields) call for no comment. The light railway from Resht to Fir Bazar was pulled up during the year. (C) Roads. 597. The budget allotment under this head for the year 1933-34 is 865,400 rials, which is an increase of 15,400 rials over last year’s figures. 598. This sum is designed, presumably, to defray the cost of the Ministry of Roads and Communications, and not to meet the cost of road construction. Road construction is paid for out of the road tax, from which grants are also made towards public instruction, sanitary services, charitable institutions, and to municipalities, as described in paragraph 419 of the annuel report for 1932. 599. The total income from the road tax is not disclosed in the budget, and hence no calculation can be made to show how much is actually spent on road construction. 600. Considerable work on the roads has been done during the past year both in repair of existing roads and in the construction of new roads. 601. The Ministry of Roads and Communications has published a Route Book of the Motor Roads of Persia, which shows sixty-six motor routes to be in existence, with a total mileage of approximately 11,500 miles. The publication errs on the side of optimism, and some of these routes should be regarded rather as projects than facts, while others are only passable in fine weather by light motor transport. 602. The following are the chief roads constructed or started, or made passable to motor transport during the year under review (the numbers of the relevant “ million ” sheets are given in brackets) :— (i) Kerej-Chalus-Habibabad (Deh Nau) (8 and 9). (ii) Fumen-Masuleh-Hirabad-Mianeh (8 and 1). (iii) Shiraz-Firuzabad-Bushire (17 and 10). (iv) Kuchan-Muhammadabad (Soviet frontier) (22). (v) Sauj Bulagh-Nagadeh direct (omitting Haidarabad) (1). (vi) Kerman-Ravar-Duhak (24). (vii) Shahabad-Eilam (Husseinabad, Pusht-i-Kuh) (2). (viii) Qasr-i-Shirin-Mansurabad (2). (ix) Kermanshah-Nausud (2). IX.— Military Affairs. (A) Army. General. 603. The Shah has not forgotten the instrument by which he rose to power, and continues to take a deep and personal interest in every branch of his army. That the army holds first place in his affections is borne out by the demeanour of the soldiery. They profit by their importance in the eyes of their Royal master, and, though naturally timid, adopt a swashbuckling attitude and strut about the streets of°the capital shouldering their civilian brethren into the gutter. 604. His Majesty continues to make unheralded descents at dawn upon units, arsenals and military schools, and engenders, by these impromptu inspections, alertness in the garrison of the capital. His instruction is imparted by the direct method, and mere seniority will not save the victim of his displeasure from chastisement with a cane in full view of his subordinates. 605. The anti-foreign feeling in the army still runs high. The military attache is not invited to attend parades, manoeuvres or demonstrations. He isWMMPMHI 92 not supplied with military information, nor is he permitted to call on any officer. The Minister of War he was permitted to approach, but this last link between him and the Persian army was rudely snapped in December when Sardar Asad was thrown into prison. 608. Training continues to improve, and as regards drill and specialist and weapon training reaches a far higher standard in the capital than in the provinces, where semi-trained troops and almost raw conscripts are engaged on field service conditions, in road protection duties and operations against the tribes to the detriment of their rudimentary instruction. The equipment of the army continues to improve, but the artillery lags far behind the other arms. An officer has been sent to India to inspect artillery equipment in the arsenals with a view to purchase, but the Persian Government is disinclined to pay the prices asked, and it is probable that a further delay in the rearming of the artillery will result. 607. The air force has made the biggest strides in development, and many new machines have been bought. 608. The adequate housing of the troops in sanitary buildings has engaged the attention of the army authorities, and many new barracks have been constructed. These are well designed, up to date, well built, airy and weatherproof. 609. As might be expected in an oriental army of rapid growth, those services ‘ ‘ who only stand and wait ’ ’ are not developed so highly as the combatant, and hence more spectacular elements, and the Persian army’s ancillary services have been woefully neglected. 610. Mechanical transport is being purchased on a large scale, but medical and sanitary establishments are hopelessly inadequate. Estimates. 611. The budget allotment for the Ministry of War for the year 1932-33 was 183,729,980 rials, or about 36 per cent, of the total budgeted expenditure. This amount includes expenditure on the navy, travelling expenses of naval and military students and the salaries of foreign naval, military and air advisers. No separate sub-headings for the various arms, branches or departments are given. 612. Other items of a military nature are 26,205,000 rials for the Amnieh (road guards); 350,000 rials for expenses in connexion with military conscription and 4,500,000 rials for frontier guards battalions. These make a total of 214,784,980 rials spent on defence services, representing over 42 per cent, of the total budgeted expenditure. Comparison with last year’s figures is not possible as the grant for the navy in last year’s budget was included in that of the Ministry of Finance. 613. During the past two years additional grants amounting to £2,700,000 were made to the Ministry of War by the Majlis from the Government reserves abroad for the purchase of war material. This grant has not been exhausted and, presumably, war material bought in 1932-33 was also paid for from this grant. Organisation. 614. It is believed that considerable changes in the order of battle of the Persian army have occurred resulting in a considerable increase of strength. Previous estimates placed the total of strength as low as 51,000. A more recent conjecture is that the Shah aims at maintaining a strength of 100,000 men. 615. Two new battalions of frontier guards have been raised for service on the Perso-Iraq frontier, one in Khuzistan and the other in Kurdistan. They have been styled “ Dizhban ” (literally “ guardians of forts ”). They perform police functions, furnish escorts and are employed on preventive duties in connexion with smuggling.93 Conscription. 616. A sum of 350,000 rials was provided in the budget under this head. A similar sum was provided last year. 617. This sum appears inadequate, but it must be borne in mind that in reality nearly all the work entailed in registration is performed by the “ Department for the Registration of Documents and Properties,” which has a 4BTbudget provision of its own, and, in the course of its investigations, collects statistics wanted alike for the purposes of conscription and census. 618. The net of conscription is being more widely thrown ever year, and evasion, even by bribery, is becoming more difficult. 619. Conscription has not, as yet, been applied to the tribes, the necessary preliminaries to which must be their subjugation, their disarmament and the functioning of the Central Government in their areas. At the present rate of progress several years must elapse before the tribesmen can be conscripted. Armament and Equipment. 620. Over 200 motor transport vehicles have been sold to the Persian army by the Ford Motor Company during 1933. 621. There have been frequent reports from the southern ports of the arrival and despatch to Tehran of lorry loads of arms and ammunition. 622. It is known that the Eastern and Western Azerbaijan Armies have been re-equipped with the Brno rifles and twenty shot automatic rifles purchased in Czechoslovakia. 623. Heavy machine guns have been issued to the cavalry of the Tehran garrison, their light automatics being transferred to the artillery. 624. An officer of the Persian army is at present in India inspecting arsenals with a view to purchasing military stores, mostly artillery equipment. 625. An unconfirmed report states that orders for 20,000 automatic pistols, model 902, and 5,000 rounds per pistol have been placed with the Uncete Company of Guernica, Spain. 626. The Persian army has discarded the pahlavi hat. For field service a soft khaki felt hat is worn, and for drill order a stiff hat of more or less British army pattern, with a coloured band denoting the arm of the service. Training and Manoeuvres. 627. The annual manoeuvres of the Tehran garrison were much curtailed in scope and duration. Originally planned for the 20th October, they were postponed until the 31st October. They only lasted twenty-four hours. The ground selected was in the vicinity of Kerej (26 miles west of Tehran). Two brigades of infantry and six aeroplanes took part. No invitations to attend were issued to foreign military attaches, nor was any report published in the press. 628. The usual review of troops of the Central Garrison was held on the 22nd February, the anniversary of the coup d’Etat of 1921. The review was very much on the same lines as those held in previous years, when, after a military display, some 10,000 troops marched past the Shah. 629. During the review eighteen of the recently acquired “ Tiger Moth ” aeroplanes flew over, three of which gave an exhibition of aerobatics much in advance of last year’s performance. No invitations were issued to members of the Diplomatic Corps, nor were military attaches invited to attend. 630. Six French military instructors were engaged, on private contracts, for the Ecole militaire in Tehran. They were due to arrive early in 1934. 631. Training in the Central Garrison is carried on intensively. Though weapon training and elementary tactical training are not neglected, most of the time seems to be spent on squad drill, presumably the elementary recruit training of the conscripts. 632. From what could be seen from a distance the standard of drill is reasonably good, but the turn out and bearing of the men when off duty is very slovenly. The turn out of the officers is uniformly good.94 A rsenals. 633. As far as is known, the two arsenals at Tehran and Parchin have been functioning well. They do not seem to have been augmented in scope as the Persian Government continues to buy arms and ammunition from abroad. (B) Air Force. 634. The year under review has seen a large increase in the number o machines in the possession of the Persian Air Force. 635. From the meagre number of seventeen only partially airworthy aeroplanes, it has been increased in size until in December the total establishment was fifty-four machines. 636. Orders have also been placed with the Hawker Engineering Company for thirty machines of the &lt;&lt; Audax ,, and “ Furytypes, fourteen of which were due to arrive at Bandar Shahpur on the 2nd January, 1934. These aircraft are fitted with American Pratt and Whitney “ Hornet ” 450-h.p. engines and are of the day bomber reconnaissance and single-seater fighter types respectively. 637. In addition, orders for a further ten of the “ Moth ” type of machines have been placed with the De Havilland Aircraft Company. 638. Colonel Alls Nordquist^ a Swede, remains in his capacity as air adviser to the Persian Government, while Sartip Ahmed Khan Nakhchevan retains his appointment as Inspector of Aviation, with Colonel Khosravani in charge of flying duties. 639. M. Ekman, a Swede, has been engaged as flying instructor, and it is understood that a further five Swedish airmen are shortly proceeding from Sweden to Persia to act in a similar capacity. 640. In January the De Havilland Company delivered twenty “ Tiger Moth ’’ machines, fitted with Gypsy-three engines, 120-h.p. This consignment was shipped to Bandar Shahpur and thence sent by train to Ahwaz, where they were assembled under the supervision of the company’s representative and flown to Tehran, with the exception of one, which, after taking the air, crashed, killing the pilot and becoming a total loss. 641. On arrival in Tehran nine of the machines (later increased to fourteen) were allotted to the flying school, which is situated at Mehrabad, 4 miles from Tehran on the main Tehran-Kazvin road. Here forty pupils (of which twenty- three eventually qualified) underwent instruction as pilots under the guidance of the above-mentioned instructor. 642. The remainder were based on the aerodrome at Qila Murgha, 2 miles south-west of Tehran, and formed into what is known as the “ Regiment.” Here the existing eighteen pilots carried out their flying duties. 643. During the review held on the 22nd February, the anniversary of the coup d'Etat of 1921, eighteen of the “ Tiger Moth ” machines flew over, after which three gave an exhibition of aerobatics. This display was much in advance of that of previous years, the looping, spinning and nose diving being a quite creditable performance. 644. On the 17th March, while sixteen of the “ Tiger Moth ” planes were practising formation flying, two collided in mid air and crashed, one of the pilots being killed and the other severely injured and the machines damaged beyond repair—thus leaving seventeen only of the original twenty. 645. Duiing June ten aeroplanes ordered from the U.S.S.R. were shipped to Pahlavi, assembled and thence flown to Tehran. Details of these machines are lacking, but it is known that they are night bombing aircraft, type R 5 and fitted with engines of German B.M.V. design and of 600-h.p. They carry one fixed machine gun in front of, and to the side of, the pilot's cockpit, and another is mounted on a gun ring on the observer’s cockpit. Provision is made for twelve bombs to be carried. 646. These machines are not proving entirely satisfactory and a performance test showed very poor results. They are on the strength of the Regiment of the air force.95 647. During July Colonel Nordquist visited Major Arfa, who has been in Europe for some three years as head of the Persian mission engaged in the purchase of war material for the Persian Government. While on this visit an order for a further nine “ Tiger Moth ” machines, to be fitted with Gypsy Major 130-h.p. engines, was placed with the De Havilland Company. 648. These machines were shipped to Bandar Shahpur, assembled in Ahwaz and flown to Tehran towards the end of December. They are fitted for, and were accompanied by, four sets of floats, for conversion to seaplanes when required. 649. Colonel Nordquist also made arrangements with the same company for the supply and erection of workships for the building complete of the fuselages, and the repair of engines, of the “Tiger Moth” and “Hawker” type of aircraft. The shops are to be in production in 1935, and will be under the direction of two experts from each of the companies and one from the American firm of Pratt and Whitney. 650. On the 28th August three of the Russian R. 5 machines gave a display of bombing in the presence of His Imperial Majesty the Shah. The target was a 25 metres circle for a “ direct ” hit and 75 metres for a “ hit ” and the bombs were dropped from a height of 1,200 metres. Out of a total of thirty- six bombs dropped, twenty hit the target. 651. During the manoeuvres of the Tehran garrison held during October, and which lasted twenty-four hours only, six machines were based on Kerej, but, beyond making an early morning reconnaissance over the Tehran headquarters, took no part in the operations. 652. It will thus be seen that during the past year the Persian air force has been augmented (excluding casualties) by twenty-seven “Tiger Moth” machines and ten Russian aircraft, and in the near future will be further so by the arrival of thirty “ Hawker ” and ten De Havilland machines. 653. Great activity has been shown in practising all forms of flying and with the passing out of the students at the school of instruction the air force should have at its disposal approximately forty trained pilots. (C) Navy. 654. No additional ships have been acquired by the Persian Government during the year under review. It has been reported that orders for a floating dock, an oil-fuelling ship, one tug and one additional gunboat have been placed in Italy. 655. The Persian Government has informed the League of Tsations that in their naval programme they ultimately aim at the following strength :— In the Caspian— 4 destroyers of total tonnage of ... ... 4,400 In the Persian Gulf— 3 cruisers, 1st class, of a total tonnage of ... 15,000 2 cruisers, 2nd class, of a total tonnage of ... 6,900 10 destroyers of a total tonnage of ... ... 10,000 4 submarines of a total tonnage of ... ... 3,200 with a total personnel of 325 officers and 4,887 petty officers and men. 656. Twenty-one of the forty Italian officers, petty officers and men who accompanied the ships which arrived from Italy last year had returned to Italy by September 1933. Unconfirmed reports state that most of the remainder have since taken their departure. 657. In April the Persian Charge d’Affaires in London made enquiries through the Foreign Office regarding the training of Persian naval cadets. Details as to the cost, duration and place of training were furnished by the Admiralty, but up to the date of the submission of this report nothing further has been heard of the scheme.96 o 658. Naval offices are in process of construction at Mohammerah on the site of the former quarantine buildings near the Shah’s statue at the confluence of the Karun River and the Shatt-el-Arab. 659. The ship Homai (formerly the Ivy, owned by Sheikh Khazal) has been turned into a training ship for naval personnel. 660. A Danish engineer, by name Kendt, has been engaged by thepfSs Persian Government to construct jetties and wharves for the Persian navy at Mohammerah. 661. A report was received in October that the two gunboats Babr and Palang would proceed on a three months’ cruise in Indian waters early in 1934. 662. That the existence of the Persian navy in the Persian Gulf would produce unpleasant incidents was obvious. 663. Such incidents have been the insult to the Union Jack at Basidu, the action of the customs mudir at Basidu, the illegal searching of dhows by Persian men-of-war outside the limits of Persian territorial waters, and the dangerous antics of Persian warships in the congested waterway of the Shatt- el-Arab. 664. These may be put down to Persian nationalism, their exuberance with a new toy, their ignorance of international law and of the principles of navigation. (D) Amnieh {Road Guards). 665. The budget provision for this force was 26,500,000 rials, which shows an increase of approximately 5 million rials over last year’s figures. 666. The force continues, on the whole, to work unobtrusively and well. 667. The men are distributed in detachments—in some cases as small as one n.c.o. and two men—over 12,000 miles of roads. They are badly housed, poorly paid and ill-equipped. They are inspected at long intervals, their pay is frequently in arrears. Their duties are arduous and necessitate exposure in all climates. It is not surprising that, dispersed as they are, they should suffer casualties in the execution of their duty when they come into contact with marauding tribesmen in superior numbers. 668. During the past year several individuals belonging to this force have been court-martialled and shot for connivance at, and even complicity in, acts of brigandage and highway robbery. Such cases are, happily, rare and their number is small in relation to the size of the force. 669. Though, in some cases, individuals voluntarily adopted a life of crime and plundered the very caravans they were paid to protect, it is probable that in the majority of cases the culprits were subjected to threats of death by the robbers if they failed to co-operate. (E) British Officers in Persia. 670. Lieut.-Colonel P. C. R. Dodd, D.S.O., M.V.O., 13th Lancers, proceeded on leave on the 22nd February, 1933, and vacated the appointment of military attache to this Legation. 671. Major G. D. Pybus, 1st Battalion the Sikh Regiment (King George’s Own), arrived to take up the appointment on the 1st July, 1933. Mr. A. C. Trott, the oriental secretary, officiated as military attache in the interval between Lieut.-Colonel Dodd’s departure and Major Pybus’s arrival. 672. Major J. Teague, O.B.E., M.C., 2/10th Baluch Regiment, arrived in Isfahan on the 9th April on nine months’ language study duty. His period of study duty was subsequently increased by three months. 673. Major H. J. Underwood, l/15th Punjab Regiment, arrived in Shiraz on the 10th December for one year’s language study duty.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT Printed for the uee of the Foreign Office.

AS far as Anglo-Persian relations are concerned the year has been unproduc tive. In January His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom seriously expected to resume general treaty negotiations and detailed instructions were drawn up for His Majesty’s Minister. No move, however, was made on the Persian side, and a series of unfortunate incidents brought matters to a state of stagnation. By the end of the year His Majesty’s Government had decided to make no further move, but to await advances from the Persian Government and aim, meanwhile, at maintaining the status quo while avoiding all danger of a renewed demand to evacuate Hen jam and Basidu. The year passed in a more or less strained atmosphere, punctuated by incidents of which the visits of Persian warships to Tamb in August and September were the most troublesome.[115391 b 2 2. The chief event of the year from the Persian point of view was the Shah’s visit to Turkey in June and July. In September and October also a number of prominent litterateurs and men of science from all parts of the world visited Persia in connexion with the Firdausi millenary celebrations. In November the Crown Prince of Sweden visited Tehran, Isfahan and other centres, accompanied by the Crown Princess. 3. At the close of the year the Persian Government found themselves involved in difficulties with their immediate neighbours; Iraq having appealed to the League of Nations over the Perso-Iraq frontier dispute, and trouble of a somewhat serious nature having arisen on the Afghan frontier in connexion with tribal affairs. They were also having difficulties with the tribes in Baluchistan. 4. Internally no special feature is noticeable. The work on the Trans- Persian Railway continues as actively as ever and many new factories are being built. The condition of the masses of the population seems to vary inversely with these modern developments. II.— Foreign Relations. (A) United Kingdom and India. (1) General Treaty Negotiations. 5. No progress was made in the negotiations during the year. 6. In January His Majesty’s Minister received his detailed instructions and a few days later he reported that the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that he was working “two or three hours a day’’ on the treaty. After a month had passed His Majesty’s Minister again enquired the position and was informed by Kazemi that he was still at work. Sir R. Hoare considered, and the Foreign Office concurred, that it would be bad tactics to show any undue eagerness, so matters were allowed to stand. 7. Meanwhile His Majesty’s Minister was becoming more and more convinced that until the ghost of Persian pretensions to Bahrein was laid, our position would become increasingly difficult. Persian activity in the Gulf was growing, and in the circumstances he felt that he should be instructed to make it clear to the Persian Government that, if they wished to resume the negotiations, they must furnish a formal assurance that they would act in the spirit of the status quo agreement. If no such assurance were given, His Majesty’s Govern ment in the United Kingdom would consider the negotiations abandoned and would take such steps as they thought fit to safeguard their interests. In the last resort this policy would mean the reference of the Bahrein question to the League of Nations. 8. The Foreign Office, who were of the opinion that these proposals involved a reversal of the policy of His Majesty’s Government, requested Sir R. Hoare to state his views at greater length. In his despatch No. 176 of the 7th April, Sir R. Hoare pointed out in reply that, in spite of successive assurances by the Shah that he desired friendly relations with His Majesty’s Government, relations were steadily deteriorating and no progress was being made in the treaty negotia tions. In these circumstances Sir R. Hoare felt that there was no hope of obtaining a treaty until the Shah was forced to believe that His Majesty's Government were 'determined to settle the Bahrein question once and for all. With the situation as it then was His Majesty’s Minister could see no certainty of avoiding a conflict occasioned either by the necessity of protecting Arab interests or by the Shah’s hypersensitiveness, particularly to foreign press articles. In these circumstances Sir R. Hoare considered that our interests might lie in choosing a suitable occasion for presenting an ‘ £ ultimatum ’ ’ on the lines indicated in the previous paragraph. 9. His Majesty’s Minister later submitted a draft of the note he suggested should be addressed to the Persian Government. In this he sketched the events of the previous eighteen months, emphasised the disquiet of His Majesty’s Government and embodied the “ultimatum.’’4 10. While these proposals were being considered by the Foreign Office, a letter, dealing mostly with other matters, was received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the course of which he stated that so long as the negotiations for a treaty were not based on equality, the balance of interest of both parties and real reciprocity between them, they would not have a firm foundation. As soon as Kazemi felt that such a solid basis really existed, he would be prepared to enter into negotiations. 11. It seemed clear from this that the Minister for Foreign Affairs considered the negotiations to be in abeyance and His Majesty’s Minister suggested that he be instructed to request Kazemi to amplify his views for the information of His Majesty’s Government. 12. Early in July His Majesty’s Minister was informed that his suggestion had been considered, but that the Cabinet had decided that for the present the objective of His Majesty’s Government should be to maintain the existing position in general and the status quo in the Persian Gulf in particular, in spite of the fact that it must be assumed from Kazemi’s letter that negotiations had been abandoned. Owing to the delicacy of the position at Henjam and Basidu it was therefore considered necessary to refrain from any action likely to provoke the Persian Government to demand our withdrawal from either place. This decision had, of course, many repercussions in the Persian Gulf, which are dealt with in the succeeding section of the report. 13. For some weeks no further word was heard of the treaty negotiations, though Mirza Hussein Khan Ala stated, before proceeding to take up his post as Persian Minister in London, that the Persian Government, having examined the draft treaty, found several points agreed to by Teymourtache inacceptable. In particular, they considered the position as regards the islands in the Persian Gulf unsatisfactory. 14. At the end of September the silence was broken by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who informed the Secretary of State at Geneva that Ala had instructions to reopen the negotiations in London. The Secretary of State replied that he had received the impression that the Persian Government did not wish to proceed with the discussions, but Kazemi denied this and reiterated the desire of the Persian Government to come to an agreement with His Majesty’s Government on all outstanding points. 15. Almost simultaneously, two visits were paid to Tamb by Persian war ships (see section II (A) (2) (m)), and His Majesty’s Government were compelled to make it clear in no uncertain terms that the complete cessation of such tactics was an essential preliminary to any negotiations. When this note was presented by His Majesty’s Minister to the Prime Minister, his Highness admitted that the draft treaty had, in fact, been re-examined, and that it was considered that Persia was being asked to give away a great deal and receive little in return. Feroughi added that he was virtually certain that if we had agreed to surrender Tamb and Abu Musa, when Teymourtache first suggested it, the treaty negotiations would have gone through. 16. Almost simultaneously with the Tamb incidents, the Persian Govern ment made the request that officers of the Indian Political Service should not in future be proposed for consular posts in Persia. (This question is dealt with in detail in section II (A) (4) {a)) The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs happened to be in London at the moment and the occasion was taken to make plain to him the views held by His Majesty’s Government with regard to this inoppor tune and discourteous request. It was emphasised that the resumption of the treaty negotiations was rendered almost impossible by such incidents. 17. In October the Prime Minister replied to His Majesty’s Minister’s note about Tamb and took the opportunity of stating that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had taken up the question of the treaty negotiations in London, and that he (Feroughi) would be pleased to see these lead to satisfactory results. It was decided not to reply to this note. 18. Beyond one or two vague references on the part of the Persian Govern ment to an intention to resume negotiations, no further mention was made of this question during the year.(2) Persian Gulf. (a) General. 19. In 1934 the situation in the Persian Gulf was quieter than in the preceding year and no incidents occurred comparable with those at Basidu in 1933, though the visits of Persian war vessels to Tamb finally led His Majesty’s Government to state their views to the Persian Government in no uncertain terms. 20. On the Persian side, a general process of ‘ k tightening up was to be observed, laws regarding territorial waters and ships’ visits were passed and the Persian Government announced their intention of taking over all lights and buoys in Persian territory. 21. The Persian Government continued to refuse to recognise the Arab sheikhdoms and were reluctant to reply in writing to communications affecting these sheikhdoms. 22. In an endeavour to clarify this situation the Minister for Foreign Affairs was informed privately in March that, since he and members of his staff had at various times expressed doubts as to the precise nature of the relations between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Arab sheikhdoms, His Majesty’s Minister had been authorised to draw attention to the various treaties (a list of which was appended) between His Majesty’s Govern ment and the Sheikhs of Koweit, Bahrein, Qatar and Muscat. The treaties with the remaining sheikhdoms had been communicated to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 1928. 23. In reply, the Minister for Foreign Affairs denied that either he or other officials of the Ministry had ever expressed ignorance as to the nature of the relations between His Majesty’s Government and the Arab sheikhdoms. He added that the Persian Government were under no obligation to recognise treaties to which they were not a party, and that they did not consider such of the treaties in question as were prejudicial to Persia’s interests to be valid. Furthermore, the Persian Government considered the conclusion of agreements relating to places ‘ £ such as Bahrein, &amp;c.,” which were inseparable parts of Persia, to be an unfriendly act. 24. The phrase “&amp;c. ” seemed to imply that Persia laid down to other of the Arab sheikhdoms, such as Koweit, and His Majesty’s Minister suggested that it might be advantageous, when replying to the letter, to try and draw the Persian Government further into the open. 25. The Foreign Office, however, decided that no useful purpose would be served by this, and Sir R. Hoare was instructed to reply that the only effect of persistence by the Persian Government in their attitude would be to render all communication between them and the Arab sheikhdoms impossible. This was no concern of His Majesty’s Government, who were, however, bound to carry out their obligations, however‘much the Persian Government, or any other Govern ment, might object. 26. No reply was received to this note. 27. The Bahrein question dragged on and a further circular setting forth the Persian claim was addressed to all members of the League. 28. It was evident that all Persian missions abroad had received instruc tions to bring before the world the claim of Persia to a paramount position in the Persian Gulf. Examples of this occurred at Washington, where the Persian Minister induced the Senate to attach an undesirable reservation to their ratifica tion of the Arms Traffic Convention; at Tokyo, where protests were made against the sale of Bahrein oil in Japan; and in Afghanistan, where Persia’s claim to j Bahrein was ventilated in the local press. 29. These matters are dealt with in detail in the succeeding sections of the report. 30. In this connexion it should be recorded that the Persian Minister at Bagdad informed the Director-General of the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs that Persian activities in the Shatt-el-Arab and elsewhere on the Perso-Iraqi frontier were only part of the Shah’s plan to oust the British altogether from the Persian Gulf. [11539] b 331. Trouble still continued (see paragraph 176 of the annual report for 1933) over the issue of visas by the Persian authorities on passports bearing the endorsements “Bahrein” or “Koweit.” His Majesty’s Minister broached the matter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but was unable to obtain any satisfac tion, and in August his Majesty’s consular officers were instructed to issue to travellers, who might become involved in difficulties with the Persian authorities, a separate passport to enable them to proceed to Bahrein, this passport to be surrendered after the journey had been made. In some cases the Persian Govern ment showed themselves willing to grant visas on a separate sheet when a passport bore the endorsement Bahrein. (b) A rms Traffic. 32. No reply was received during 1934 to the note addressed to the Persian Charge d’Affaires in London on the 3rd June, 1933 (see paragraph 187 of the annual report for 1933), and the whole foundation of the British proposals was destroyed by a note addressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in April to Sir R. Hoare, in which Kazemi stated that the Persian Government “ withdrew ” the draft exchange of notes originally submitted by Teymourtache in 1932. The reasons which had led the Persian Government to take this step were not at the moment clear, but the situation was clarified a month later, when a further note was received enclosing a new draft agreement. 33. This document contained the offer to allow His Majesty’s ships to verify the Persian flag in the case of vessels of under 500 tons, but, as had been foreseen, only on the basis of reciprocity. In the case of vessels flying the flag of third parties or no flag at all, the Persian Government would collaborate “ on a footing of equality ” in preventing the traffic in arms. This draft was obviously unacceptable to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, and after interdepartmental discussion in London, a reply was addressed in November to the Persian Minister in London. In this note it was explained to Hussein Khan Ala that the Persian proposals would give the Persian naval authorities rights of control over vessels, amongst others, belonging to the Arab States of the Persian Gulf; that the Persian Government had hitherto not recognised these States or abandoned their claims to the territory of some of them; and that they had not seen their way to recognise the special treaty relations between His Majesty’s Government and these rulers. In these circum stances, the rulers in question could not be expected to acquiesce in a situation by which their ships would be subject to interference by the Persian naval authorities and His Majesty’s Government could not advise them to do so. For these reasons, His Majesty’s Government regretted that they were unable to accept the Persian proposals. 34. This note provoked a reply from the Persian Minister at the end of the year. He stated that he had referred to Tehran for further instructions and expressed his regret that the attitude of His Majesty’s Government should be so unhelpful. 35. Meanwhile, a further example of Persian activity had come to light. In June the United States Senate ratified the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925, but with a reservation providing, among other things, that adherence to the treaty should not be construed ‘ ‘ as denying any right of sovereignty which the Kingdom of Persia may have in and to the Persian Gulf or to the waters thereof.” 36. Enquiries in Washington elicited the information that the Persian Minister there (Ghaffar Khan Jelal) had approached the State Department with a request for their assistance in obtaining the insertion by the Senate of this reservation. When this request was refused, he applied to Senator King, who promised to help him. Unfortunately, the State Department’s efforts to block the reservation broke down, and it was passed without explanation, discussion or debate. 37. Steps were at once taken to explain the British point of view to the American Embassy in London and to the State Department, and at the end of the year some hope was entertained that the President would withdraw the reservation, since he now realised that it was an “ interpretative reservation ”7 [11539] B 4 which would require the assent of all signatory parties. As this assent could obviously not he obtained, the whole treaty must lapse unless the reservation were withdrawn, since the adhesion of the United States Government to the convention was necessary before the principal anus-exporting countries would consent to adhere to it. 38. For the first time for many years news reached the Legation that a large consignment of rifles, alleged to bear German markings, had been run between Jask and Charbar for the Khan of Remishk, who is in revolt against the Central Government. This question is dealt with in section III (D). (c) Bahrein. 39. Early in the year His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom bought sufficient land at Bahrein to provide for a combined naval and air base. The negotiations were carried through with great secrecy and, as there was no comment on the Persian side, it is probable that the Persian Government remain jn ignorance of this fact. 40. Various articles in British and foreign newspapers dealing with the activities of the American Oil Company at Bahrein, which had just struck oil and was commencing production, aroused considerable outbursts in the Persian press and provoked a statement in the Majlis by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In the course of his speech, he reiterated the Persian view and stated that he had addressed a note to the American Minister in Tehran pointing out that the Standard Oil Company’s concession was null and void, since it had not been obtained from the Persian Government, whose claim to Bahrein was incontestable. Copies of this note were subsequently circulated at the request of the Persian Government by the Secretariat of the League of Nations to all members of the League. In reply, His Majesty’s Government requested the Secretary-General of the League to draw the attention of all members of the League to the British notes of the 18th January, 1928, and the 18th February, 1929, which had been previously circulated. These notes rebutted the Persian claim. 41. Meanwhile, the suspicion arose that the Persian Government had at last determined to bring the question before the League of Nations at its next session in September. 42. In the view of the Foreign Office, it was desirable that the United Kingdom delegation should be prepared for such an eventuality, and it was pointed out that there were two lines open to the Persian Government: (a) The Minister for Foreign Affairs might raise the matter generally in his opening speech; {h) he might bring the question before the Council either under article 11 or under article 15 of the Covenant. 43. The Foreign Office considered, and the India Office subsequently concurred, that, in the event of the Persian Government adopting course {a), it would suffice for the United Kingdom delegate to explain the point of view of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in a brief and summary manner. 44. Discussion further took place as to the attitude which His Majesty’s Government should adopt in the event of the Persian Government raising the question under articles 11 or 15 of the Covenant, but the matter ceased to be urgent when no action was taken by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to bring the issue before either the Council or the Assembly. (d) Bahreinis in Persia. 45. Considerable trouble was caused in the first half of the year by the oppression by the local authorities in Khuzistan of a large number of Bahreinis resident in the neighbourhood of Gusbah. 46. Many of these individuals had not taken out sij ills and found them selves involved in difficulties with the police and registration authorities, who, as usual, behaved in an exceedingly high-handed manner, beating and ill-treating the men concerned.8 47. Complaints were made by the Bahreinis to His Majesty’s vice-consul at Mohammerah and also to the Sheikh of Bahrein, who expressed great concern at the way in which his subjects were being treated and asked the Political Resident to do what he could to alleviate the position. 48. It appeared on investigation that two main classes of Bahreinis were involved : those born at Bahrein, or at any rate outside Persia; and those born m Persia. These classes were again divided into those who owned land and those who did not. As in the case of the Kurramis in North Persia and British- protected persons at Charbar, it was fairly certain that the Bahreinis at Gusbah were endeavouring to avoid all the responsibilities of Persian nationality, while at the same time escaping the disabilities suffered by foreigners. 49. It was obvious that the Legation was unable to protect Bahreinis born in Persia, since they had dual nationality, and it was equally evident that those who owned land, even if born outside Persia, would do well to accept sij ills, i athei than lose their land, hven the remainder (those born outside Persia who owned no land) would be well advised to accept si j ills in the last resort, as this would not affect their status as Bahreinis should they subsequently choose to leave Persia. 50. Advice on these lines was tendered to the Bahreinis by His Majesty’s vice-consul after His Majesty’s Minister had failed to persuade the central authorities not to press the question of registration. 51. Some discussion ensued as to the merits of retaliation, but, as in 1932, it was agreed that no useful purpose would be served by restrictive measures against Persians in Bahrein. 52. 1 he question of the treatment of Bahreinis in Persia is bound up with the main Bahrein problem considered in the previous section of the report, and no settlement of the minor issue seems possible until the major question is solved. On this occasion the trouble died down slowly, and it is not unlikely that by now almost every Bahreini who has elected to remain in Persia has taken out a si j ill. (e) Basidu. JJarly in January the Minister for Foreign Affairs’ reply to the note of the 28th December regarding the arrest ol the Mudir (see paragraph 252 of the annual report for 1933) was received. It proved to contain a statement that even had the Mudu been sent straight back to Basidu, the Persian Government would have protested against his arrest, since they recognised no British rights at Basidu. Nevertheless, in view of the desire for friendly relations expressed in the Legation s note, the Persian Government did not wish the dispute to be continued. 1 ^4. All difficulty was, however, not yet at an end. In his statement before the Majlis (see paragraph 251 of the 1933 report) the Minister for Foreign Affairs went much further than had been expected. The arrest of the Mudir was explained as being due to a misunderstanding, and it was stated that the naval guard had been withdrawn and that the institutions which the British had latelv set up there without permission had been abolished. 55. His Majesty’s Minister considered, however, that it would be unwise to leopen the argument, and after consultation with the Foreign Office he was instructed merely to indicate verbally to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty s Government were unfavourably impressed with his statement, which went beyond what had been agreed at his audience with the Shah, but that, as the statement was obviously for internal consumption, he was willing to drop the matter. It was decided to make no mention of the possibility of re-establishing 56. I his exchange brought the Mudir incident to a close. n IK h? ^ ^stion that arose was the future of the inhabitants of V® 1 U ’ 7 10 been brought up to consider themselves as British subjects and who would undoubtedly suffer if the concession was surrendered to the Persians. investl , g oVnn ’ t ^ e F olltl ?j l ResideR t suggested that he be authorised to spend the sum of £400, which would probably suffice to transport elsewhere such9 [11539] b 5 of the inhabitants as preferred to emigrate rather than live under the Persian flag. Official sanction for this expenditure had not been obtained by the end of the year, but the decision of the Cabinet not to adopt any new line of policy towards Persia placed this question somewhat in the background, since it was obviously impossible to encourage the inhabitants of Basidu to emigrate so long as we hoped to maintain the status quo. 58. Meanwhile, some visits to the island by Persian officials had occurred and led the Political Resident to suggest that evacuation was the only solution. His Majesty’s Minister did not, however, share this view and urged that qur attitude should be examined in connexion with the whole question of British policy towards Persia, which is dealt with in section II (A) (1). As has already been stated in the foregoing paragraph, His Majesty’s Government decided to continue the existing line of policy as far as possible and to maintain the position at Basidu. In these circumstances a blind eye was to be turned to the activities of Persian officials, but sloops were to visit Basidu at frequent intervals. His Majesty’s Minister contended that there would be less risk of an incident if sloops only called at rare intervals or, alternatively, if a sloop was permanently stationed at Basidu. The matter was still under consideration at the end of the year. 59. Visits of Persian officials continued, but no protests were made except in regard to the first, when the Legation’s note elicited a reply reiterating that the Persian view of the status quo differed from that held by His Majesty’s Govern ment and taking exception to the use of the word ‘ w British ” in connexion with Basidu. 60. At the end of the year a slightly different aspect of these visits was disclosed by an official of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, who complained that, when police officers went to Persian Basidu to collect conscripts, the latter fled to British Basidu and took shelter in buildings or under the British flag. The official asked that no support be given to such behaviour. Since the risk of an invasion of British Basidu by Persian police in search of deserters might have to be faced at any moment, His Majesty’s Minister suggested that the senior naval officer take an early opportunity of warning the inhabitants that such attempts to avoid conscription could not be countenanced, and that those living in Persian Basidu, or those inhabitants of British Basidu who had taken out sijills, should surrender themselves to the police if demand were made. (f) Charbar. 61. Considerable trouble occurred at Charbar during the year over the desire of various Indian British subjects and British-protected persons to relinquish the Persian nationality which had been imposed on them by the Persian Nationality Law. They were in much the same position as the Kurramis on the Caspian coast, whose difficulties are dealt with in paragraphs 359-363 of the annual report for 1933. 62. In order to assist them to make out their applications for the renunciation of Persian nationality, His Majesty’s consul at Kerman had already paid a visit to Charbar in 1933. In January 1934 he paid a further visit and was assured by the local authorities that they would do their best to assist these people. 63. Meanwhile, the Legation had been endeavouring to persuade the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to expedite the examination of the various applications already submitted, and in June it was learnt that the local authorities had orders to examine those persons who desired to revert to British nationality. In the circumstances, it was considered advisable that the Munshi from the consular office at Bandar Abbas should proceed to Charbar to assist in the examination. 64. This man, Muhammad Khan Gelladarry, who had already been at Charbar with Major Lincoln, spent a rather fruitless three weeks there and was then lured aboard the mail boat and deported to Bandar Abbas. 65. On receipt of this news His Majesty’s Minister addressed an urgent protest to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and instructed the head clerk of the Bandar Abbas office to proceed to Charbar, which he did.10 66. Alter considerable delay, the Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that Gelladarry had not been introduced to the local authorities at Charbar and that he had interfered in matters beyond the scope of his duty. A report from Major Lincoln enabled His Majesty’s Minister to refute these arguments vigorously. 67. Meanwhile, the head clerk reported from Charbar that the Khoja community were being victimised by the police and that they were not allowed to visit him. Force and threats were being used to induce them to sign documents renouncing all intention to revert to British nationality. It was then suggested to the Ministry lor Foreign Affairs that a joint commission, of which Major Lincoln should be one and the local Governor another member, should examine these applicants. This suggestion was turned down, but the Ministry stated that an official of the census department would be sent to look into the matter. The Legation would be informed of his departure for Charbar, and any unofficial assistance or information which His Majesty’s consul at Kerman could give him would be welcomed. 68. Two months later, in November, Major Lincoln reported from Kerman that such an official had, in fact, proceeded to Charbar. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs at first denied that the visit of this official had anything to do with this matter, but later admitted that he was, in fact, specially instructed to go into the question of the British community. 69. Since reports were, moreover, being received that the persons concerned were being subjected to improper pressure at the hands of the police, Major Lincoln was at once instructed to proceed to Charbar, and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs were informed of his impending arrival. In spite of this warning he was delayed for three hours on landing, and the local Governor stated that he had received no intimation of the visit. Major Lincoln found that practically all the Khojas had been forced to take out sijills, but he was unable to communicate with them, as the building in which he was staying was watched by secret police. 70. After telegraphic consultation with Major Lincoln, it was decided to address a note to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in which it was proposed that the men in question should be summoned before the Governor in the presence of Major Lincoln, and that any who expressed the desire to renounce Persian nationality and emigrate should be allowed to do so. A request was further made that Major Lincoln should, meanwhile, be allowed to see the persons involved to explain the position to them, and the Ministry were asked to see that no obstacles were placed in the way of anyone desirous of visiting him. 71. Major Lincoln was instructed to explain to the Khojas that no difficulties arose over those persons who decided to take out sijills'rather than emigrate, since they would be given British documents in the event of their wishing to travel outside Persia; that those who desired to retain their British nationality and yet remain in Persia were choosing a risky course, and that His MajestySfGovernment could not assume responsibility for the consequences; and that the Legation would do its best to ensure that those who chose to emigrate were not further intimidated. &amp; 72. No reply had been received to this note by the end of the year. 73. Meanwhile, Major Lincoln remained at Charbar, since it was felt his presence served as a brake on the actions of the local authorities. that (g) Flag Incident at Bushire. 74. Early in December news was received from the Political Resident tha a Persian naval officer had caused the red ensign flown by the Mesopotamia I ersm Corporation launch, Garmsir, to be loWered. This officer, Lieutenan ^tP^ ya Ty ada ’ y h ° n aS m uniform ’ was a passenger on board the British Indi; tondpr y aVlgatl ° n P- 0 ^? an J steamship Varna when she arrived at Bushire Thi side in ^usual waft^tM^ re ? stered at Calcutta, came along A f i th A Y to take off P a ssengers, and Lieutenant Darayazada whos* attitude was threatening and abusive, and who was believed to'be under th, influence of drink went far as to strike a clerk of thf Brit sh indi' Stearn Navigation Company. In face of this, the crew lowered the C Th incident took place at the outer anchorage, some 31 miles from shore and there fore outside territorial waters according to the views of His Maiestv’s Govern ment, though within them according to Persian law. Majesty s Govern11 [11539] B 6 75. On receipt of this news His Majesty’s Minister instructed the Political Resident to bring the matter to the notice of the Governor of the Southern Ports, and suggested to the Foreign Office that he be authorised, to begin with, to speak to the Minister for Foreign Affairs as from himself and request that the matter be dealt with promptly. 76. The Foreign Office concurred in this suggestion, and His Majesty’s Minister duly saw the Minister for Foreign Affairs and left with him a brief memorandum detailing the essential facts of the case. Next day Kazemi stated that he had taken up the matter with the Ministry of War, but there was no further news before the end of the year. (li) Hen)am. • 77. The efforts of the Legation to ensure that the assailants of Mr. Morton (see paragraph 261 of the annual report for 1933) were brought to trial were in some sort successful. They were acquitted by the lower court at Bandar Abbas, but the public prosecutor was not satisfied and sent the case to the Appeal Court at Kerman. After some months it was learnt that the case had been heard, this time in absentia, at Kerman, and that the accused had again been acquitted. His Majesty’s Minister expressed his surprise at the procedure adopted in a case where the accusation was of such a serious nature, and enquired what further steps the public prosecutor proposed to take. No reply had been received to this communication by the end of the year. 78. During the year difficulties arose over the importation into Henjam of stores destined for use in the Royal Indian Marine depot. There had been onlv one previous example of such importation since the establishment of the Trade Monopoly Law. This was in 1931 when, after some discussion, the Persian Government agreed to permit the entry of the stores free of customs dues and Trade Monopoly Law restrictions. 79. On this occasion, however, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, while admitting the 1931 example, insisted that there was no “ juridical basis ” for exemption. 80. The matter was referred to the Foreign Office, and His Majesty’s Minister was instructed to abandon his request for exemption from customs dues on the ground that such dues had in fact been paid in the past. As regards Trade Monopoly Law restrictions, he was authorised to make the best arrangement he could orally. 81. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs were approached in the above sense, and by the end of the year had shown a disposition to admit that, since the stores were the property of a Government, were not procurable locally, and had been purchased with money from outside Persia, it should be possible to secure exemption from Trade Monopoly Law restrictions. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs approached the Ministry of Commerce in this sense. 82. Two incidents occurred at Henjam during 1934 in which British sailors were involved. 83. The first incident happened when H.M.S. Ormonde was coaling. A petty officer saw a coolie snatch a piece of bread from a boy and intervened to restore it to the boy. The coolie pushed the petty officer aside, whereupon the latter hit him on the face with the back of his hand, causing his lip to bleed. The coolie complained, but when the facts were investigated he was told he had no grounds for complaint. The petty officer was, however, admonished for acting hastily. 84. On the Ormonde's next visit to Henjam the Deputy Governor requested that the petty officer be sent ashore for an investigation. He was informed that, as the incident had occurred on board a man-of-war, this request could not be acceded to. 85. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs subsequently sent in a note of protest, but His Majesty’s Minister was by then in possession of the facts of the case and returned a detailed reply expressing his regret that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should have been troubled by this incident, but upholding the principle that the captain of H.M.S. Ormonde was within his rights in refusing to sendthe petty officer ashore for interrogation. Sir R. Hoare added that it was a pity that the Deputy Governor did not accept the captain s invitation to discuss the matter on board. 86. Xo further communication was received from the Ministiy for foreign Affairs in reply to this note. 87. The second incident involved some liberty men from H.M.S. honey. 88. At the end of November a note was received from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs stating that these men had beaten two policemen, that an officer from the ship admitted that they were under the influence of drink, and that the captain had refused the Deputy Governor’s request to send the men ashore for investigation. 89. On enquiry it transpired that the men, who were not drunk, were returning from the canteen and had accidentally broken a water-carrier s pitcher. The men, who were set on by armed police, knocked two of these down. Stones were then thrown at them by bystanders. The captain of H.M.S. /* owey sent an officer to see the Deputy Governor and express his regrets. 90. These facts were brought to the notice of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, who were also informed that the senior naval officer’s staff officer had subsequently called on the Deputy Governor and that measures had been concerted between them whereby a repetition of such incidents should be avoided. 91. Subsequent reports made it fairly clear that the whole affair was an organised piece of trouble on the Persian side. 92. The Persian Government did not revert again to the matter. 93. An element of comic opera was introduced into official relations in the question of three ancient muzzle-loading guns which had been brought to Henjam in 1928 to be used as moorings. After having been used for this purpose for some years they were landed at Henjam. In October 1934 they were again required as moorings, but the Deputy Governor refused to allow them to be embarked on the ground that the export of fire-arms was forbidden. 94. All efforts to persuade officials of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the guns should come under the law regarding antiques, rather than the law about weapons, failed, and in December His Majesty’s Minister left a memorandum explaining the facts with the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, who stated, somewhat astonishingly, that the question was one of “ prestige,” but promised to do his best with the Ministry of War. 95. The question had not been settled by the end of the year. 96. One further source of trouble was disclosed during the year in connexion with the registration of the Royal Indian Marine launches and small boats used at Henjam. 97. The question was first raised in August, when the senior naval officer said he would be glad to discuss the matter with the Deputy Governor, who, however, merely referred to Tehran for further instructions.' The point was again raised in November, but it was not until a month later that the matter became pressing, when the Deputy Governor threatened to arrest the clerk in charge if Persian registration numbers were not given to the boats. He later said that the boats were not to be used until numbered. 98. I he captain of H.M.S. Hidefovd reasoned with him, but the Governor had received direct orders from Tehran and was unable to withdraw his demand. 99. His Majesty’s Minister reported the facts of the case to the Foreign Office and asked for instructions. At the same time he spoke to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and urged that orders be sent to Henjam to allow matters to go on as hitherto until the question could be settled between them. His Majesty’s Minister also asked for a copy of the regulations under which the orders had been given. 100. After a week of continual pressure on the IVlimstry for Foreign A.ffairs it was learnt that orders had in fact been sent to Henjam, as requested, that no further action should be taken pending discussion in Tehran.13 [11539J . B 7 101. The Foreign Office had meanwhile ascertained that there were no reliable precedents in other parts of the world, and in view of the delicacy of the position at Hen jam, the matter was left to the discretion of His Majesty s Minister, who was authorised in the last resort to agree to number the vessels so long as “ registration” did not imply that they were registered as Persian vessels, and so long as they were still allowed to wear the white ensign. 102. In view of the approaching visit of the Commander-in-chief, East Indies Squadron, to Tehran, which was due to take place early in the new year, it was decided to postpone discussion with the Persian authorities until his arrival. 103. The Admiralty had meanwhile suggested that the boats be numbered R.I.N.l, R.I.N.2, &amp;c., as a compromise. 104. The regulations under which the orders had been issued were not received in the Legation till after the close of the year, when they were found to be totally inapplicable. (i) Lighting and Buoying. 105. Almost a year passed after the receipt of the Minister for Foreign Affairs’ note, referred to in paragraph 207 of the annual report for 1933, before the Persian Government took any further action in the matter of the surrender of lights and buoys on Persian territory. 106. In September, however, the Legation was notified verbally that a note might be expected shortly, though it was not until the end of November that it arrived. 107. This referred to the previous verbal warning, and stated that the Persian Government’s experts had now completed their examination of the lights and buoys in the Persian Gulf, and that arrangements were being made not only to keep up the present marks, but to instal new ones. The Ministry requested that instructions might be sent to the stall in charge of existing lights to hand over to Persian officials the management of lights and buoys situated on Persian territory and in Persian waters, as soon as the necessary arrangements had been made. 108. A brief reply was returned to this note, merely stating that the question had been referred to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. 109. Interdepartmental discussion ensued in London, but it proved impossible to reach a decision by the end of the year as to the exact tei ms of the reply to be returned to the Persian request. 110. Meanwhile, Colonel Ward who, apart from his duties as port officer at Basra, acts as agent for the Government of India in superintending the Persian Gulf lights, had been consulted by His Majesty’s Aunbassador at Bagdad, and had stated that it would be practicable to move the Qais Island light vessel outside Persian territorial waters and to change the main shipping route in the Gulf. The only difficulty would be that a light would be required on Sirri Island. (j) Naval Visits. 111. No changes or difficulties occurred in connexion with the routine arrangements for visits by His Majesty’s ships to Persian ports, but a new aspect was given to the question by the publication in September of some lengthy regulations laying down the conditions of passage and anchorage of foieign warships in Persian waters and ports. These regulations were drawn up undei article 4 of the law regarding territorial wateis, which is dealt with m section II (A) (2) {n). 112. The new regulations are obviously based on a draft presented by Teymourtache to Sir R. Clive in 1929, but are much amplified. They contain a mass of trivial rules about such matters as salutes, calls, the use of wireless, &amp;c., some of which are highly unusual. The essential clause of the regulations is, however, one which, though not at all clearly phrased, apparently lays down that ‘ ‘ notification ” is necessary in the case of two ships or less passing through14 Persian waters. In the case of more than two ships “ permission ” is required. A further clause states that the regulations are not to apply in cases in which warships “ possess special permission.” Finally, it was not clear whether the regulations were to be applied at Hen jam. 113. After interdepartmental discussion in London, His Majesty’s Minister was instructed to inform the Persian Government in a formal note that, in the view of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, in so far as the regulations made the innocent passage of either belligerent or non-belligerent foreign warships through Persian territorial waters conditional on ^prior notification, they were contrary to established international law and practice 114. This note was sent in on the 1st December, and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs had not replied by the end of the year. 115. It was furthermore agreed, after discussion in London, that it should be presumed that the clause about “ warships having special permission ” was intended to cover the sloops maintained in the Persian Gulf, which by special agreement do not notify the central authorities of their visits to Persian ports. 116. Finally, it was presumed that the regulations were not intended to apply at Hen jam. 117. It is always possible that these two presumptions may prove to be / incorrect, but it was agreed that it was preferable to leave it to the Persian • Government to raise the matter. So far nothing has occurred to show that the presumptions are wrong. (k) Persian Naval A ctivity. i ,ia . Throughout the year under review Persian war vessels continued to harass Arab dhows, and a number of cases were reported in which they had ehaved m a most high-handed manner. The most important incident is' dealt with in section II (A) (2) (m), under “ Tamb and Abu Musa,” and the others need not be detailed here. It suffices to say that it was found impossible to prevent these incidents and almost equally difficult to obtain any redress after they had occurred. The Legation’s task in this, as in other matters was not rendered easier by the refusal of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to reply in writing to complaints. This habit is based, somewhat obscurely, on the refusal of the I ersian Government to recognise the Arab sheikhdoms. ' ii • V' February, the two larger Persian warships, Babr and Palana made atBombay 0118 their armal in the ^sian Llf, m o, dm ^refitted T ft to be «mrrni/out 6 T spHe oTtU UTT “ ^ the exact natnre of ^repairs matjon, it proved possible to arrange° the^refit wiJn amo^th Ind'inFebluary the I eisian sloops arrived at Bombay, having called at Karachi en route' * =i “sr saws*. 3 ~ Perdan'sailor ^deserted'^t^^Jombay^aml^alf efforts fruitless. - ana al1 elto1 to trace him have proved Trinchomali, where the^LmLderdn^iie^^tT 0 ^ 6 ' 1 '^ t0 i Colombo and Hawkins was awaiting then Lientena. t L. i “ ? c l uadron * ln wife, who behaved wit^ great tact throughout he 6 !. ^' 1, and hiS EngHsh Commander-in-chief, and at the institratfon of M, Ti’ Wer n en( ? rtalned b .V the of the Persian navy had a lono- talk with iiV' Bay an dor the commandant relations in the Gulf ingeneraf and the C H ommander - in - chief about naval mention was made of the^MudirIncident ’ ag mCldent in P arti ™lar. No15 [11539] » 8 123. The Commander-in-chief stated that he regarded the incident as ofhcially closed, but that he would, of course, be glad to hear any explanations that Lieutenant-Colonel Bayandor cared to give. The latter then declared that the flag had been pulled down by a junior officer who did not know what he was doing and that it was all a mistake. He concluded by expressing his deep regret. 124. On the subject of the Shatt-el-Arab, Lieutenant-Colonel Bayandor said that, while he was unable to recognise the Port of Basra regulations, he would nevertheless do his best to see that no incidents occurred. In view of this conversation, it is worthy of note that no serious complaints against the behaviour of Persian war vessels in the Shatt were brought to the notice of His Majesty’s Legation during the year. 125. After a lavish round of entertainments to the officers and crews of the Persian sloops, the Babr and Palang left on the return voyage to Mohammerah. The visit had undoubtedly achieved a useful purpose and, in view of the natural feeling in the East Indies Squadron, the manner in which the meeting was arranged was deserving of the highest praise. 126. Good relations between the two navies were further cemented by a round of festivities at Mohammerah, where the senior iiaval officer was awaiting the return of the Persian sloops. (l) Slavery. 127. Five escaped slaves landed at Hen jam during 1934. The Governor gave them work and refused to hand them back to their owners, who appeared in search of them. (m) Tamb and Abu Musa. 128. Tamb in 1934 occupied the same position in the limelight as Basidu in 1933, though fortunately the question never reached the same fever-heat. ' 129. In April a Persian customs launch visited the island and a party landed. No protest was made, however, since it was the policy of His Majesty’s Government to avoid anything in the nature of a needless challenge to Persia, especially in matters connected with the Gulf. 130. The next two visits were, however, too serious to be overlooked. 131. At the end of August the Palang was sighted at Tamb by His Majesty’s ships Shoreham and Bideford. Lieutenant-Colonel Bayandor said that he merely wished to anchor for the night. He claimed that it was the first time he had heard that the island belonged to the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah, and that he did not know the sheikh wished for notification of visits. Next day it was discovered that the Palang had found a Debai dhow at Little Tamb, taken it to Tamb and there searched it. The search took place on the side of the island opposite to that on which the British sloops were. 132. The story of this visit had hardly reached the Legation when news arrived that a second visit had been paid to Tamb, this time by the Chahrokh, the captain of which denied all knowledge of the intimation given to Bayandor regarding the need for notification of such visits, although it was later discovered that he had met Bayandor in the meanwhile. The captain further stated that he considered Tamb to be Persian territory and that he was looking for a deserter. It later transpired that a party had landed and asked the headman where the custom-house was and other questions. The lighthouse was not visited. 133. It happened that, before learning of these incidents, the Secretary of State had had a conversation with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs at Geneva, in which the latter had referred to the earnest desire of the Shah that Anglo-Persian relations should be on a friendly footing, and had expressed the hope that the treaty negotiations would shortly be reopened. This interview proved an admirable peg on which to hang a protest, and His Majesty’s Minister was instructed to inform the Persian Government in a formal note that the Secretary of State was very pleased to have had the opportunity of discussing Anglo-Persian relations with Kazemi, but that he was disquieted to learn on his return to London that, in spite of these protestations of friendship, a Persian warship had paid yet a further visit to Tamb without notification. This could16 only mean either that the Persian Government desired to create a fictitious value for their claim in future treaty negotiations, or that they were attempting to attain their end by methods incompatible with their position as members of the League of Nations. The total cessation of such tactics was an essential preliminary to the resumption of negotiations. 134. At the same time, His Majesty’s Minister was instructed to read to the Prime Minister the text of a note which was not being sent in in writing on the present occasion, but which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would reluctantly have to address officially to the Persian Government in the event of another such visit. Nevertheless, they felt it necessary to leave the Persian Government in no doubt as to the position that would arise in such an event. 135. The second note contained the instructions sent to the senior naval officer as to the steps which he should take if a Persian gunboat were again discovered by a British sloop at Tamb or Abu Musa. The instructions were to the following effect: If the Persian vessel had already landed a party which endeavoured to perform any act of territorial jurisdiction, or subsequently landed a party without permission from the British vessel, or attempted to perform any act of jurisdiction in territorial waters, the officer commanding His Majesty’s ship was to demand the withdrawal of the landing party and/br insist on the Persian vessel leaving within a reasonable period. If the Persian officer commanding declined to comply with this request his action would be regarded as an act of aggression against the sheikh. In that event, and if no other measures sufficed, the officer commanding His Majesty’s ship would in the last resort be obliged to use force. 136. The first note was presented and the gist of the second note duly read to the Prime Minister by His Majesty’s Minister. As was only to be expected. Jberoughi protested his ignorance of the matter and endeavoured to persuade His Majesty s Minister that action was often taken at a distance from Tehran without the knowledge of the Central Government, a suggestion which oil It. Hoaie was able to treat with polite incredulity. His Majesty’s Minister went on to add that he was unable to understand why the Persian Government could not adopt the same procedure as regards Tamb and Abu Musa as we did in regard to Sirri, and concluded by reading the second note, which resulted in a rather painful silence. 137 - . Meanwhile, a similar communication was being made to the Persian Minister in London. Some days later the latter called again at the Foreign Office and stated, on instructions from his Government, that the Persian Government regarded Tamb and Abu Musa as Persian territory, and therefore could not but regard His Majesty s Government’s communication as an unfriendly gesture JNo reply was made to this verbal statement. at • 1 c 011116 ^ 0 . 11 it is of interest to note that Feroughi informed His Majesty s Minister at the interview recorded above that he was virtually certain that, H His Majesty s Government had agreed to surrender Tamb and Abu Musa when Teymourtache had first suggested it, the treaty negotiations would have been crowned with success^ The Persian idea of success may, however be asswat G ”“— »&lt; *• Government on the subject of Tamb and that'there was no need to reiterate them marivHrMa^vG Po MaJeSty ’ S t MiniSter WOuld admit that the assumptions made by His Majesty s Government were not in accordance with the facts No reply was returned to this nebulous communication. 140. No further visits of Persian vessels to Tamb took place during- the vear but a curious incident occurred at the end of December wiLn ii wn a- that the Sheikh of Ras-al-Kha.mah had had hTs flagstaffTm the island l”d At the close of the year no further information was available Vmt if &gt; n possible that he had been negotiating secretly with the Persian Government^As ‘ r ™ eed ““ (17 [11539] B 9 (n) Territorial Waters. 141. In June the Majlis passed a law defining the territorial waters claimed by Persia. This law was'obviously based on a project shown by Teymourtache to Sir R. Clive in 1929, which the latter was able to persuade him to drop. The main difference was that, while Teymourtache’s draft only claimed a 3-mile limit plus 5 miles “adjacent waters,” the new law claimed.G miles of territorial waters plus a further 6 miles “zone of naval control.” 142 His Majesty’s Minister was at once instructed to inform the Persian Government formally,'' on behalf of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Arab sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf, that no claim to territorial waters outside the 3-mile limit could be recognised. 143. In reply to this note the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that the limits fixed were in accordance with the needs of the country and that any State is entitled to fix the limits it deems necessary for its territorial waters. 144. It seems certain that the claim to what is virtually a 12-mile limit is due to the urgent need of controlling smuggling which, owing to the high Persian tariff, is assuming serious proportions in the Gulf. 145. At the end of the year detailed examination of the law disclosed that the Persian Government claimed a single belt of territorial waters for a group of islands. In the view of His Majesty’s Government, each island possesses its own belt of territorial waters and His Majesty’s Minister was instructed so to infoim the Persian Government. 146. Being in doubt as to whether the protest should he addressed on behalf of the Arab Sheikhdoms as well as on behalf of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, His Majesty’s Minister referred the matter again to the Foreign Office. In consequence, no note on this subject had been addressed to the Persian Government by the end of the year. (o) Visit of Persian Official to Gwadur. 147 In March the Persian passport officer at Quetta paid an unannounced visit to Gwadur, possibly to inspect the Imperial Airways emergency landing o-round at Jiwni, or more probably to investigate stories that the Government ot India were supplying arms to the insurgent Persian tribesmen. A minor I ersian official from Bandar Abbas had already visited Charbar with this object. 148. His Majesty’s Minister suggested that he be authorised to address a protest to the Persian Government, on behalf of the Sultan of Muscat, against this unnotified visit. 149. While this proposal was being considered, it was discovered that the Persian passport officer had been instructed to investigate the tribal situation, in consultation with officers on the Persian side of the frontier. He had been afforded every facility by the authorities at Quetta and it is interesting that he should have informed the Political Agent, Kalat, that the charges of intrigue against the Government of India were groundless. 150 In August His Majesty’s Minister was instructed to take courteous exception, on behalf of the Sultan of Muscat, to the Persian passport officer s unnotified visit to Gwadur. The Minister for Foreign Affairs made no reply to this note. (3) East Persia. (a) Baluchistan Frontier. 151. As far as is known, no attempt was made by the Persian Government during the year to complete their survey of the Baluchistan frontier and no communication on the subject was received from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. (b) Extradition. 152 During the latter part of the year, one written and a number of verbal requests were made by an official of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs for the extradition of persons who had escaped from East Persia into Bntis Baluchistan. Details of these cases were forwarded to the Government ot India18 with a request that Ilis Majesty’s Minister be instructed as to what reply he should make. No instructions had been received by the end of the year, except in regard to one case where the Government of India stated that they were unable to agree to extradition in the absence of an extradition treaty. (c) Land Customs and Embarcjos. 153. After some further discussion (see paragraph 291 of the annual report for 1933) it was decided to impose an embargo on silver on the whole western land frontier of India. At the same time an embargo was placed on the entry into India through Las Bala or Kalat of the following goods : piece-goods of cotton, silk, artificial silk or mixtures, sugar, alcoholic liquors, cigarettes, saccharine. Ihese goods were, however, still allowed to enter via Nok Kundi and, since some ol them were produced in Persia, there was thus no infringement of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty of 1928. It is true that silver has, at any rate up to 1926, been mined in Persia, but only in the smallest quantities and as it happened the Persian Government never invoked the Tariff Autonomy Treaty. 154. The Nok Kundi route had been much used by merchants who wished to avoid the Indian customs duty on silver and who shipped it across Persia in transit. At the moment the embargo was established, considerable consignments vvere actually lying at Zahedan or on their way across Persia, and the Persian Charge d Affaires in London represented that in view of the fact that the embargo had been established without warning, much hardship was being caused to exporters and asked that the embargo be raised for six months. After some discussion he was informed that the Government of India could not agree to the temporary suspension of the embargo owing to the loss that would result to Indian revenues. Ihe difficulty was, however, met by an agreement reached Yvith the I eisian consul-general at Delhi, by which importers of silver were to pay an amount equal to the sea customs duty when the silver was entrained at Nok Kundi. 155. In October it was disclosed that there was a considerable traffic in precious stones across this frontier and as diamonds are not a product of Persia, ^ ov A eriimen ^ I n dia considered that an embargo would not infringe the Tariff Autonomy Treaty. After consultation with London, the embargo was established in November with the proviso that diamonds confiscated in the first inrporte? by °se 1? ^ Iedeemed 011 P a y ment of the duty payable had they been n 15 u 6 i ^ eanw il 1 e a fc ? ta ^ embargo had been placed on the importation over the whole western 1 arid frontier of Japanese piece-goods, unless covered by a certificate issued by the Department of Commerce and Industry in Japan This embargo was part of the general embargo on all Indian land and sea frontiers. fU f ^ ec T etar y of State : f° r India approved in November the proposal that a limited and customs regime be established. It was considered best to appi} this to all land frontiers and not merely to the Persian frontier. The Governments of Nepal and Afghanistan were warned that this measure was in contemplation but His Majesty’s Minister stated that, in his opinion the past behaviour of the I ersian Government absolved the Government of India’from any obligation to warn them. any 158. At the end of the year an official of the Ministry of Finance approachec the commercial secretary verbally with a suggestion that the Persian Governmenl would be willing to prohibit the transit trade through Persia of any articles whicl the Government of India wished to exclude, provided normal and local trade ir I ei si an products was left free. This suggestion was communicated to the the ™ ’ but n ° f0rmal P ro P° sals ha d been received by the close of (d) Zahedan Railway. ■ A 5 . 9 , Th f Fenian Government did not revert to the question of the reopen ing of the railway until the very end of the year. The Minister of Finance then approached His Majesty s Minister privately through the Anglo-Persian Oil Company with the suggestion that they might meet and discuss the matter He tradrwith^InX 111 K A° rasan al j d had been impressed with the need of increasing tiade with India. Moreover, he suggested that the reopening of the railway10 [11539] B 10 would help the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. On enquiry it was learnt that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company now supplied Meshed from Tehran, owing to the high cost of transport from the south, where prices had been increased by 2 to 4 rials a tin by the closure of the railway. The Minister of Finance’s demarche was reported to the Foreign Office and Government of India, but no immediate reply was returned to him. (e) Brigandage in East Persia. 160. A large number of hold-ups occurred on the roads in East Persia, a British vice-consul being involved in one. Mr. and Mrs. Hart, with their son and servants, were shot at near Turbat-i-Haidary while proceeding from Meshed to Birjand. Mrs. Hart, the driver and another servant were wounded, the two latter seriously. They were robbed of most of their possessions and maltreated by the brigands, who held up several lorries at the same time. 161. Mrs. Hart and her son succeeded in reaching Meshed about midnight, Mr. Hart remaining on the road with the wounded men. In spite of energetic action by the secretary to the consulate-general, he was unable to procure assist ance from the General Officer Commanding troops at Meshed for over three hours. He finally proceeded in his own car with two soldiers to the scene of the hold-up and brought back Mr. Hart and the wounded men. No further assistance was rendered by the military. A particularly glaring example of inefficiency and cowardice was furnished by the gendarmes at a post 16 miles from the hold-up. These men, though informed the same afternoon of what had occurred, refused to start in pursuit of the brigands. 162. Regret was expressed verbally to the Legation and also to the Foreign Office by the Persian Minister in London, but no written expression of regret was ever received. 163. When the conduct of the military authorities was known, an energetic protest was addressed to the Persian Government. On the Minister for Foreign Affairs’ return from East Persia, whither he had gone in connexion with the Perso-Afghan frontier dispute, he expressed to His Majesty’s Minister personally the regret of the Persian Government. He stated that everything possible was being done to capture the brigands and added, spontaneously, that the Persian Government would compensate Mr. and Mrs. Hart for their losses. 164. Meanwhile, one of the wounded men had died, and it was discovered that he claimed to be an Indian British subject who had come into Persia without any papers. His claim was being investigated at the end of the year. 165. His Majesty’s Minister proposed that, in view of the Minister for Foreign Affairs’ statement that compensation would be paid, the incident should be considered closed, a view in which the Foreign Office concurred. The Govern ment of India, however, felt that the incident should not be considered closed until the question of compensation should have been definitely settled. At the end of the year His Majesty’s Minister had in his possession a list of the losses sustained by Mr. and Mrs. Hart, and discussion was proceeding as to whether he should request compensation for shock and injury to Mrs. Hart and claim the hospital and burial expenses of the man who had died. (f) Police Search of Zahedan Vice-Consulate. 166. Early in the year a reply was received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Legation’s protest referred to in paragraph 299 of the annual report for 1933. In this, Kazemi merely stated that the building searched “ was not considered part of the vice-consulate.” 167. The Zahedan vice-consulate occupies a large area and the buildings are somewhat scattered, but the whole is surrounded by a barbed-wire fence and it seemed impossible that any mistake should have been made. Colonel Daly was, however, instructed to send a plan of the enceinte, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs was informed that, while His Majesty’s Minister was prepared to believe that the local officials had acted under a misapprehension, he could not regard their statement as sufficient to close the incident.mi W! 20 168. In reply to this note, the Minister for Foreign Affairs repeated that the building searched was not considered part of the vice-consulate and that there was, therefore, no discourtesy. He added that the circumstances were such that, even if the building had been part of the vice-consulate, there was no call for any courtesy to be extended. Finally, he drew attention to the fact that a “ courtesy was not to be confused with a “ right.” 169. His Majesty’s Minister expressed his surprise at the second statement, and, in reply to the third, pointed out that he had made no mention of “ rights.” He followed up this note by transmitting a plan of the vice-consulate, showing conclusively that the building searched, while 250 yards from the vice-consul’s house, was within the enceinte and close to the office. 170. After several reminders, the Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that renewed enquiries established that there had been no breach of international law. To this His Majesty’s Minister answered that he had never relied on international law, but rather on the courtesy common between nations. He added that the house searched was indisputably part of the vice-consulate and that there was no case of hot pursuit. In England, even in a case of hot pursuit, the police would first have sought permission for a search. (g) Tribal Unrest. 171. During the year tribal unrest in Fast and South-East Persia assumed serious proportions. There was also trouble on the Afghan frontier in the north; this is dealt with in section II (C) (1). Owing, however, to the lack of reliable information in the area, it was not easy for the Legation to obtain details. 172. In February His Majesty’s Minister received a note containing the accusation that two British “ secret agents ” had crossed the frontier and con ducted intrigues with a leading Baluchi chief. It was implied that their object had been to seduce Persian subjects from their allegiance. 173 His Majesty’s Minister did his best to persuade the Minister for Foreign Affairs that this note was not one which could be presented to a friendly Power, but he was unable to get Kazemi to withdraw it. Needless to say, enquiries on the spot confirmed that there was no truth in this story. His Majesty’s Minister was instructed so to inform the Persian Government in a curtly-worded note, and to add that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were surprised that any such report should have been taken seriously. 174. Rumours of persistent trouble continued to reach the Legation, culminating in a report from a well-informed and reliable source that the Khan of Remishk, who was one of the ringleaders, had run 2,000 German-made rifles. The senior naval officer failed by the end of the year to find any evidence substan tiating this report, but from remarks made by a Persian official it may be taken as certain that gun-running on a considerable scale had in fact taken place. 175. At the close of the year, it was evident that the Persian Government were becoming seriously alarmed at the inability of the forces in East and South- East Persia to cope with the tribesmen (see also section II (A) (2) (o)). (4) Special Indian Relations. (a) Consuls from the Indian Political Service. 176. In September a minor official of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs brought to the oriental secretary an official note in reply to one from the Legation iequesting exequaturs for Colonel Daly in his new position as consul-general at Meshed and foi Major 1 yper as vice-consul at .Zabul. This note itself merelv requested that other persons be selected for the posts; the official, however, explained that the I oisian Government had decided to request that in future no officers from the Indian Political Service be chosen as consuls in Persia. He stated that these officers were accustomed to deal with a subject race and brought these methods with them to Persia. He did not wish to make any personal com plaints; it was the traditional outlook of the “ Indian ” consuls to which the Persian Government took exception. The oriental secretary was unable to persuade the official not to deliver the note.21 0 177. His Majesty’s Minister merely replied that he was not free to with draw the request for the exequaturs and asked the Foreign Office for instructions. 178. As was to be expected, the Government of India took a most serious view of this move, which coincided with the visit of the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to London. The Government of India requested that an immediate protest he addressed to the Persian Government and suggested that reciprocal action should be taken against Persian consuls in India. 179. An early opportunity was taken of bringing home to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs in London the views of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. It was made clear that the action of the Persian Govern ment was considered discourteous and inopportune, that objections to individual consuls could only be justified on the strongest possible grounds and that objections to a whole category of officials could not be admitted. It was explained that officers from the Indian service were particularly well qualified to look after the interests of the large Indian colony (amounting to at least 4,000 persons) in East and South Persia, and emphasis was laid on the fact that all efforts to improve Anglo-Persian relations were doomed to failure so long as the Persian Govern ment behaved in such an irresponsible manner. 180. His Majesty’s Minister was instructed to deliver a note to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, stating that, in the view of His Majesty’s Govern ment, the undisputed right of any Government to refuse to accept particular individuals as consuls could only be exercised in very exceptional cases, where strong and definite reasons for refusal could be given. No adequate reasons were given in the present instance, and the action of the Persian Government was rendered even more discourteous by the fact that, in both cases, the requests for exequaturs had been in their hands for a considerable time. It was therefore earnestly hoped that the matter would be reconsidered. The views of His Majesty’s Government were also explained to the Persian Minister in London, who had been instructed to take up the matter. 181. The strength of these representations had the desired effect, and about ten days later the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs handed to His Majesty’s Minister a note in which the Persian Government agreed to the appointments of Colonel Daly and Major Pyper, while reserving the question of principle. He added that this step had been taken, first, because His Majesty’s Minister had complained that no warning had been received by His Majesty’s (Government, and, secondly, because His Majesty’s Minister had stated that administrative difficulties would be caused if the appointments were not agreed to. In point of fact, His Majesty’s Minister had only mentioned the administrative difficulties incidentally. 182. Ala subsequently stated in London that, while these two exequaturs had been granted, the Persian Government adhered to their views in principle. He was informed that the Persian Government’s methods had rendered all discussion of the subject virtually impossible and had greatly increased the difficulty of bringing about any change in the present system. Ala begged that the Persian Government’s views should be kept in mind, but was given no encouragement. 183. Three points in connexion with this affair are deserving of interest. 184. First, at the Firdausi celebrations at Meshed, when Major Gastrell (acting consul-general at Meshed) was presented to the Shah, the latter enquired of the Prime Minister if this was the man of whom he had spoken, to which the Prime Minister replied that he was only an acting officer. This incident seems to establish that the whole affair was inspired by the Shah. 185. Secondly, before his departure for London, Ala enquired of Colonel Loch, who was then in Tehran, how T the Indian Political Service was recruited and trained. Ala, therefore, probably already knew of the projected note, and this gives point to the surprise expressed by Suheily, when His Majesty’s Minister presented his protest, that the matter had not been mentioned by Kazemi before he left for Geneva. 186. Thirdly, some weeks later the first secretary of the American Legation was informed by an official of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty’s [11539]’ ' ^ b 11Government had agreed to send no more “ Indian ” consuls to Persia. He was disabused by His Majesty’s Charge d’Afltaires. This tale has presumably been put up to save Kazemi’s face, and it is possible that it had even been told to the Shah. 187. The matter was left at this stage, and since no other consuls from the Indian Political Service were introduced during the year, it is not known whether the Persian Government have decided to drop their request. (b) Criminal Tribes. 188. No complaints were received during the year from the Persian Govern ment about the working of the Criminal Tribes Act (see paragraph 42 of the annual report for 1933). (c) Bombay Riots. 189. Compensation was slowly paid out to the sufferers in the Bombay riots (see paragraph 43 of the 1933 report), and no further communications were received from the Persian Government. (5) A nglo-Persian Oil Company. 190. After the difficulties of 1933 the company enjoyed a quiet year. Work on the pipe-line between the Naft Khanah field, which is to be known henceforth as Naft-i-Shah, and Kermanshah was pushed on rapidly and the final welding was completed in December. Work was still proceeding on the three pumping stations and on the refinery, which, it is anticipated, will be opened in June 1935. (6) Imperial Airways. 191. Complaints continued to be received from the Persian Government at intervals during the year that Imperial Airways aircraft had flown over Jask. this question was complicated by the claim of the Persian Government to what amounts to a 12-mile limit of territorial waters. The complaints were investigated and appeared to be groundless. (7) The Imperial Bank of Persia. 192. In 1933 the bank were faced by a demand for municipal taxation on the chief manager s residence. Correspondence on this subject continued in 1934, the bank claiming that the sentence in their concession'(“ La banque, ses etablissements et ses succursales” would be exempt from all taxation) covered the residences of the staff, while the municipality held that it did not. 193. The question was referred to the Foreign Office, and the Legation was informed that it was one on which divergent views might legitimately be held. The Foieign Office pointed out that, even if the hank were exempt, the munici pality might well claim that the occupants of houses owned by the bank were liable. In these circumstances it was considered advisable not to resist if the municipality pressed their demand, which they had not done by the end of the year. J 194. The Ministry of Finance also raised the question of income tax which is at present not paid by the bank in Persia. This matter was under discussion with tiie Hoard in London at the end of the year. (8) Imferial and International Communications Com-pany. 19.1 The question of the duty levied by the Persian Government on th&lt; company s importations (see paragraph 344 of the annual report for 1933 continued to be the subject of discussion during the year. 196 The Persian Government maintained that such items as medicine' and clothing could not be claimed as “necessaire au bon fonctionnement de k igne, and after months of futile discussion His Majesty’s Minister felt thai it was hopeless to press the claim The Foreign Office were therefore asked fo, instructions, which had not reached the legation by the end of the year.23 [11539] B 12 197. The cable ship Lady Denison-Pender again visited the Persian Gulf during the year. The Persian Government accorded the necessary iacilities and initimated that no repairs were required to the Henjam-Bandar Abbas cable. 198. After discussion with the Imperial and International Communication Company’s agent at Task, a note was addressed to the Minister lor horeign Affairs complaining of the encroachments by the military authorities into the company’s area. It was proposed that the company should surrender various buildings for which they had no use and which were apparently needed by the military authorities. In return for this the Persian Government would cause a wall to be built round the area, thus delimiting it in a satisfactory manner. 199. No written reply has been received to this note by the end of the year, but the Legation were informed orally that, while the Ministry for Foreign Affairs admitted that there was something in the Legation’s arguments, nothing could be decided until a commission had examined the buildings and site. r I his commission would report as soon as possible and the matter would then be discussed further with the Legation. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs also refused to admit that the area of the concession to-day must be that fixed in the agreement of 1887. This aspect of the question was under discussion with the Foreign Office at the close of the year. (9) Claims. 200. No progress was made with any claims at Tehran during the year, and the files of the British claims were still under examination in the foreign Office. 201. The claims of the Persian Railway Syndicate and the Persian Trans port Company formed the subject of correspondence with the Ministry for foreign Affairs. The latter was the object of intensive examination during the year, as a result of which a lengthy note was addressed to the Minister for foreign Affairs rebutting the Persian Government’s defence (made in 1932) of their action in cancelling the company’s concession. This note pressed for an impartial examination of the company’s claim to compensation. 202. The American Minister was unable to obtain any satisfaction in the matter of the Ulen Company’s claim against the Persian Government, in which the British firm of Stewart McDonnell are interested. His efforts merely resulted in a new campaign against the company in the Tehran press. 10 (10) Consular Affairs. (a) Mails. 203. During the year the courier system between Bagdad and Bush ire worked smoothly, though considerable labour was thrown on His Majesty’s Embassy at Bagdad and His Majesty’s consul at Basra, on whom fell the onus of obtaining the necessary visas and handing the mail to the captains of the British India Fast Mail. At the end of the year a scheme for a weekly service (the present one is fortnightly) was under discussion. This was to be run in connexion with the new Imperial Airways service. No decision has been reached by the end of the year. 204. During most of the year mails to His Majesty’s consulates in East Persia reached Tehran in the bag and were sent on to Meshed by special courier. This method obviously resulted in much time being lost, and in September a dummy run was staged, a courier bringing mail from Quetta to Zahedan. The trial succeeded, but 'difficulties were raised by the Governor of Zahedan, who felt unable to give a courier’s visa to a messenger delivering mail to the Foreign and Political Department, on the ground that he was only allowed by the regula tions to give visas to couriers carrying mail to Ministries for Foreign Affairs. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs were informed that the Foreign and Political Department were, in fact, the “ Ministry for Foreign Affairs ” of the Government of India, and were requested to authorise the Governor to grant visas. No reply had been received to this note by the end of the year.24 (b) Consular Reorganisation. 205. After a year's delay the Persian Government at last signified their agreement to the amalgamation of the Bandar Abbas and Kerman districts and the Meshed-Birjand-Zabul-Zahedan districts. In the case of the latter, the question of the refusal of exequaturs to Colonel Daly and Major Pyper (see section II (A) (4) {a)) was involved and was probably responsible for the Persian Government’s delay in replying. (11) Legation Property. 206. During the year discussion continued as to the terms on which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would surrender a strip of land for street-widening purposes on the east side of the Legation. The municipality’s plan involved the demolition of two houses, the gate house and consulate office, and His Majesty’s Minister therefore proposed that the Legation should only surrender a triangular strip of ground which would avoid the necessity of any rebuilding, though it would necessitate some slight modifications in street planning. 207. After some discussion the municipality turned this suggestion down, and work was begun on the detailed plans and estimates for the larger scheme. In October the latter were received from London and were communicated to the municipality. 208. His Majesty’s Minister’s note made it plain that His Majesty’s Government were only prepared to agree to cede the land on condition that all the expenses were paid for in advance, and that only the estimates and plans drawn up by His Majesty’s Office of Works were used. 209. The estimates included 414,000 rials for the sale of the land at 120 rials a square metre, 469,970 rials for rebuilding the houses and further items for cost of supervision and rent for two members of the staff who would have to take houses outside for some months. The total estimate was 931 970 rials which is equivalent to about £12,500 at 75 rials to £1. 2 10 The municipality were further informed that they would be expected to rebuild at their own expense the outer wall and street pavement and were requested to reply by the 1st January in view of the fact that it would be necessary to include the work in the Office of Works’ estimates if it was to be carried out during 1935. 211. No reply had been received to this note by the end of the year.

(a) Mr. E. C. Brewster. 215. When this gentleman, who is a senior employee of the Amrlo-Persh.n fl Company, was crossing the Karun from Mohammerah to Abadan Island tote m c&lt;.25 &lt; night with some friends, he found a Persian naval launch tied up at the jetty blocking the steps. Though it was not admitted at the time, he used some violence (not amounting to assault) in awakening the crew and abused them. Next day he was summoned to the office of the naval commandant and there detained, only being released on the personal guarantee of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s manager at Abadan. 216. Lieutenant-Colonel Bayandor was inclined to take a serious view of the incident, which was complicated by the untruthfulness of the British subjects concerned to His Majesty’s vice-consul, but he finally received authority Horn Tehran to settle the matter locally, and, largely as a result of Captain Chauncy s tact, the incident was closed by Mr. Brewster shaking hands with the sailor whom he had abused and apologising in the presence of Lieutenant-Colonel Bayandor and other officers. 217. Mr. Brewster’s detention was a clear breach of the Safeguards, but in view of the weakness of his position, it was perhaps fortunate that the naval authorities, with whom Captain Chauncy was on intimate terms, dealt with the matter throughout and did not call in the police. 218. In the circumstances, it was deemed wise for His Majesty s Legation to take no part in the question. (b) Mr. D. J. Lewis. 219 The trial of Mr. Lewis for manslaughter (see paragraph 384 of the annual report for 1933) took place early in the year. He was sentenced to sixty days’ imprisonment with the option of a fine, and as the weight ot the evidence was heavily against him, he may be considered lucky to have got oft so lightly. He made no appeal against the sentence. (c) General Hay and Party. 220. Early in June His Majesty’s Legation learnt that General Hay, the head of the British military mission to Iraq, accompanied by his wife, daughtei, another British officer and His Majesty’s vice-consul at Diana, had inadvertently crossed the Persian frontier beyond Rayat on the Rowanduz route, and had been detained by the Persian authorities at Khaneh. 221. His Majesty’s Minister requested the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make urgent enquiries, and later ascertained that the party had been released after twenty-four hours’ detention. 222. It later transpired that the party had crossed the frontier in ignorance of its whereabouts, and had been detained at Khaneh, since they had no passports. After twenty-four hours’ delay, occupied by the local authorities in getting into touch with their superiors, the party were released, after having sl ^ necl a V roces ~ verbal setting forth the facts (in Persian, which they could not read). 223. It was incontrovertible that the party had, in fact, committed a breach of the passport regulations, but His Majesty’s Minister continued to pi ess foi an investigation. In August the Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that they had crossed the frontier without passports, and that after investigation they had been released. To this His Majesty’s Minister replied that there was no boundary mark, and that, as the party had obviously crossed the frontier unwittingly there was no justification for detaining them for so long. He requested that the officials concerned be admonished for their discourtesy. 224. Kazemi then replied that the officials had acted in accordance with their instructions and that there could be no question of admonishment. 225. It was obviously futile to pursue the matter further, but His Majesty s Minister decided to express his surprise that the detention of respectable foreigners should not be regarded as a discourtesy. The correspondence was closed by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, who stated, not without justification, that as none of the party possessed passports, their respectability could not be taken for granted. Suheily added that, if the enforcement of regulations pertaining in a country is a discourtesy, such discourtesies aie committed every day and everywhere in the world. [11539] B 13•9W 26 (d) Jehan Khan. 226. Early in January 1934 it was discovered that the police had, some months earlier, entered and searched the house, outside His Majesty’s Legation, occupied by Jehan Khan, one of the Indian pensioner orderlies employed in the Legation. They removed certain articles as security for a debt which it was alleged Jehan Khan’s son-in-law owed to a third party. 227. An immediate protest was made by His Majesty’s Minister, which elicited from the Minister for Foreign Affairs a reply to the effect that diplomatic immunity could not be recognised for the servants of Legations. The question was then referred to the Foreign Office. 228. His Majesty’s Minister, was later duly instructed to inform the Persian Government that, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, official servants of the Minister were entitled, by the law of nations, to full diplomatic immunity. At the same time, he submitted lengthy quotations from recognised authorities on international law in support of this view. 229. As was to be expected, the Minister for Foreign Affairs took six months to answer this note. His reply, which was couched in unusually courteous and restrained terms, stated that this was one of the problems of internatibnal law which was not the subject of unanimous agreement. The view held by the Persian Government was shared by some other Governments, and they regretted that they could not agree with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. 230. This note was referred to the Foreign Office with a request for instructions, which had not arrived at the end of the year. 231. Meanwhile, Jehan Khan was still endeavouring to secure the restitu tion of his confiscated property. (e) Mesopotamia Persia Corporation. 232. This case (see paragraph 385 of the annual report for 1933) was brought to a successful conclusion during the year. The Mesopotamia Persia Corporation obtained a verdict in their favour from the Court of Appeal at Shiraz and from the Court of Cassation at Tehran. 233. They were awarded costs, but had not succeeded in obtaining them from Kazeruni by the end of the year. The task is likely to prove one of considerable difficulty. (f) Mr. Parsons. 234. It was not until the end of April that Mr. Parsons bail was withdrawn (see paragraph 391 of the annual report for 1933), and it was then decided that a claim for compensation should be preferred. 235. His Majesty’s Minister wrote privately to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and recited in detail the various abuses that had occurred. He asked for £100 as a slight compensation for Mr. Parsons’ sufferings. 236. In spite of constant reminders, no reply was received to this letter until the end of September, when an official of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs stated that the fact that the bail had been withdrawn did not mean that Mr. Parsons was innocent. The charge was still hanging over his head and he might be brought to trial at any time. As regards compensation, the official admitted in so many words that none could be paid, since this would establish a precedent foi so many Persians who had been the victims of wrongful imprisonment. 237. His Majesty s Minister refused to take this verbal statement as an answer ^pd left with the Minister for Foreign Affairs an a)ide-memoire to this cliect, which at la.st piovoked a written answer, which confirmed what the Legation had learnt orally; namely, that the cancellation of the bail did not establish Mr. Parsons’ innocence and that no claim for compensation could lie. , T . , 238 - His Majesty’s Minister decided to argue the case personally with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but no suitable opportunity had presented itself by the end of the year.27 (g) Mr. Townshend Smith. 239. As stated in paragraph 401 of the annual report for 1933, Mr. Townshend Smith’s fate remained uncertain at the end of the year. It soon became apparent, however, that the Persian Government were determined that £ . a, he should leave the country and on the 16th January a note was received giving him six weeks’ notice. 240. His Majesty’s Minister pointed out that it would be impossible for him to settle his affairs in such a short period and made every effort to secure a prolongation. In this he was unsuccessful, the Minister for Foreign Affairs pointing out that it was several months since Mr. Townshend Smith had first f been warned to leave Persia and that he ought to have spent that time in settling his affairs instead of developing his mine still further. 241. Just before his departure Mr. Townshend Smith formed a partnership with a Mr. Jones, who runs a leather factory in Tehran. Mr. Jones was to manage the mine for Mr. Townshend Smith. 242. On the 1st March Mr. Townshend Smith was at last sent from Tehran to Khaniqin under police surveillance and from thence proceeded to Bagdad, where he was joined by his Persian wife and children. He has remained in Bagdad ever since, efforts to find him employment elsewhere having proved fruitless. (h) Mr. A. C. Stocks. 243. This gentleman, an engineer employed by Crossley Brothers, was refused an exit visa on the ground that the company had not fulfilled completely a contract to erect two engines and switchboards in the Shah’s cotton mill at Shahi. 244. It appeared that one switchboard, for which the General Electric Company were responsible, was not in fact ready, but that it was not yet needed. In spite of this the Persian authorities refused to appoint the commission who were to examine the work before taking over the Crossley engines. 245. His Majesty’s Minister protested energetically against what amounted to a restriction on the liberty of movement of a British subject, but for some days it was impossible to shake the Persian authorities. Crossley Brothers finally agreed to appoint another engineer as their representative after the departure of Mr. Stocks and in return the Persian authorities agreed to send the commission to Shahi. The commission was duly satisfied and Mr. Stocks left Persia after nearly a month’s delay. 246. The chief difficulty in this case was that the Shah himself was concerned, and in his absence in Turkey no one dared assume the responsibility of appointing a commission to take over work which was not, in their view, completed—even though neither Crossley Brothers nor Mr. Stocks personally were responsible for the delay. (14) Legation Wireless. &lt; 247. The question of the Legation wireless and the dissemination of news is dealt with in section III (D) (4), since it is bound up with the formation of the Pars News Agency. •r (B) Iraq. (1) General. 248. Perso-Iraqi relations are so bound up with the question of the common frontier between the two countries—including, of course, the Shatt-el-Arab—that it is not only impossible, but inadvisable, if a clear picture is to be gained, to divide up the section on Perso-Iraqi relations into different sub-sections. A general review has, therefore, been preferred. 249. Incidents on the frontier were neither as frequent nor as grave as those that occurred in the preceding year, but the series of pin-pricks still continued. Persian officials continued to misconduct themselves on the Shatt-el- [11539] b 14 iwarn 28 Arab and, while the commandant of the Persian navy promised verbally to do what he could to observe the Port of Basra regulations, minor incidents continued to occur. On the land section of the frontier there was no serious tribal trouble, but the Persian Government continued to complain that rebels were receiving Iraqi support and Persian officials made frequent incursions over the frontier and police posts were established on Iraqi territory. All Iraqi protests remained unanswered or provoked the reply that the Peisian Government did not recognise the existing frontier. Moreover, the inability of the Persian forces to deal satisfactorily with the rebels, led to the publication of complaining articles in the Tehran press. 250. As the year progressed, however, the tone of the press changed and the general sense was that Persia desired Iraq to be powerful and independent of imperialistic Governments. It was felt that the Shah had given orders that a settlement must be reached, but before any negotiations could take place the Iiaqi Government became alarmed at the cancellation of the Shah s visit to Iraq and at the attempts which he was believed to be making at Angora to win over 1 urkey to the Persian side. 251. In July the Persian Government invited Nuri-es-Said to Tehran, but this invitation was refused on the ground that if he returned empty-handed Iraqi prestige would suffer. Meanwhile the Tehran press continued to be very friendly in tone. 252. When the Council meeting opened at Geneva in September, Kazemi informed the Secretary of State that a formula might be found by tracing the land frontier southwards to a definite point and then saying that from this point it would follow a course as prescribed by the rules of international law; this course would, in fact, be the thalweg, but there was no need to say so and Iraq would continue to have full opportunities for using the channel. The Secretary of State returned a non-committal reply to this suggestion which was not, of course, acceptable to the Iraqi Government. 253. The next move came from the Persian Minister at Bagdad who proposed that as far as the land frontier was concerned, a preamble might state that, while Iraq recognised the 1913-14 protocol, Persia did not; the main body of the agreement would then trace the existing land frontier. In the view of the Foreign Office, any agreement redefining one part of the frontier would weaken Iraq’s case in contending that the whole 1913-14 definition was legal and binding. 254. At this juncture the Persians established yet another police post upon Iraqi territory, possibly in the delusive hope that this would make the Iraqi Government more willing to come to an agreement. 255. On his way back to Persia via Bagdad, Kazemi informed Nuri that he would shortly put forward proposals for the settlement of the frontier question. It was not known what these proposals were, but it was probable that they were identical with those of the Persian Minister at Bagdad, already referred to. Kazemi added that he did not want to take the case to the League of Nations. 256. Meanwhile, during his visit to London, Nuri Pasha had sought the views of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom as to the advisability of bringing Persia before the League under article 11 of the Covenant. He was warned that this might not result in a clear cut decision and that the Council might have to interpret the frontier by the Hookah channel, an eventuality that was not without risks. Nuri Pasha, however, discounted these dangers and a tentative draft of a letter to be addressed to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations was prepared. This letter recited the Iraqi grievances under four main heads : the behaviour of the Persian navy in the Shatt-el-Arab; the establish ment by the Persians of six police posts at various points on Iraqi territory; the seizure of the Sarkushk lands by Persian villagers; and the diversion of the waters of the Gunjan Cham river by the Persian authorities, thus starving the Iraqi town of Zarbatiyah which is entitled to half the water. These complaints were supported by quotations from correspondence between the two Governments. 257. On his return to Bagdad Nuri Pasha learnt, as has been stated above, of fresh Persian encroachments. These he was unable to settle by means of a29 [11539] b 15 mixed commission, which was refused by the Persian Government. At the same time he was faced by the unacceptable proposals already referred to. In view of this and increasing difficulties on the Shatt-el-Arab, the Iraqi Government felt that no other course was open to them but reference to the League. When informed of this, His Majesty’s Government stated that the Iraqi Government could count on all proper assistance and support, and the draft of the lettei to the Secretary-General was finally approved. It was presented on the 4th December, and a copy was simultaneously sent to the Persian Government. 258. When the news was published, the Persian press assumed a pained tone and efforts were at once made to canvass for all available support. 259. The Persian Minister in London, in an interview with the Secretary of State, enquired whether His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had been consulted by the Iraqi Government about the step which they had taken, and expressed the hope that His Majesty’s Government would give to his Government in advance some assurance that when they dealt with the matter as a member of the Council, Persia might count upon a favourable consideration of her case. The Persian Minister was informed that, while His Majesty’s Government were, of course, aware of the importance which the Iraqi Govern ment attached to the frontier question, their action in appealing to the League had been taken entirely on their own initiative. M. Ala was at the same time informed that His Majesty’s Government could not in any way commit themselves in advance in respect of a case which would obviously have to be decided on its merits when the time came, and he was warned that the Persian Government would do well to consider very carefully the legal aspect of their position. 260. In Tehran, the Minister for Foreign Affairs argued that His Majesty’s Government had in 1929 promised to use their good offices vis-a-vis the Govern ment of Iraq to assist Persia to obtain her reasonable demands. Such a communication had, in fact, been made to Teymourtache by Sir R. Clive. His Majesty’s Minister took an early opportunity of making it clear that this letter dealt with a practical issue and not with a juridical matter. The Prime Minister admitted that Persia had never followed up any of the proposals made to her (including the Conservancy Board). 261. At the end of the year the Persian Government replied to the Iraqi note. It denied the validity of the instruments on which Iraq relied and added that the Persian Government would welcome immediate direct negotiation with the Iraqi Government, though they would acquiesce in the submission of the question to the League if necessary. 262. The Iraqi Government was not behind the Persian Government in canvassing for support. Nuri Pasha passed through Angora on his way to Geneva and according to his own account secured an oral assurance from the Ghazi that Turkey would not support the Persian case, in spite of the fact that the Turkish Government found itself in a difficult position because they had, in negotiation about the Perso-Turkish frontier, always denied the validity of the 1913-14 protocol. Nuri Pasha was destined to be followed to Angora by Kazemi early in the new year. 263. During the year some interdepartmental discussion took place in London on the subject of the Conservancy Board Convention, but no attempt was made to persuade the Persian Government to agree to it. It was hoped that once the main question of the frontier had been settled by the League of Nations, it would be possible to persuade the Persian Government to accept the convention as giving them all they required for practical purposes. 264. In this connexion, it should be recorded that the Persian Minister at Bagdad informed the Director-General of the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs that Persian tactics in the Shatt were only part of the Shah’s plan to drive the British from the Gulf. The Persian Government would sign no agreement in which His Majesty’s Government were partners. 265. Discussion of the Fao Bar Dredging Agreement continued during the year, and it was finally decided to endeavour to obtain from the Iraqi Government an assurance in writing that they would adjust the harbour dues to the actual cost of dredging. This assurance had not been obtained at the end of the year.impw'T 30 (2) Treaties and Agreements. 266. The “Accord provisoire” of 1929 and exchange of notes respecting frontier matters of 1932 were both renewed at six-monthly intervals. (C) Other Countries. (1) A jghanistan. 267. Perso-Afghan relations occupied a far more prominent place in 1934 than during the previous year. 268. In March it was learnt that the Turkish Government had been invited and had agreed to arbitrate on the disputed section of the frontier near Musabad, which lies to the south of the area delimited by General Maclean in 1891 (see paragraph 100 of the annual report for 1933). The area claimed by the Persian Government had been in Afghan occupation for very many years. 269. The Turkish commission, which was headed by General Fahrettin Pasha and consisted of nine members, arrived in Tehran in October and proceeded at once to the frontier. After an examination on the spot, Fahrettin Pasha went to Kabul to discuss the question. During his absence some raiding appears to have taken place which gave rise to considerable tension. No doubt as a result of this, the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs proceeded unexpectedly early in December to Meshed, whence they went to the frontier for a conference with the Turkish arbitrator. 270. Meanwhile news reached the Legation of considerable trouble on the frontier and the Tehran press announced that an Afghan force had pillaged twenty-five villages and carried off 2,000 Persian peasants. The Afghan Ambassador alleged that the latter were voluntary emigrants who were only following the example of 200 families who had emigrated in July to avoid taxation and conscription. It appeared probable that this was the more correct version. 271. The Persian Government suggested and the Afghan Government agreed that a mixed commission should be appointed to examine the various incidents. Simultaneously, the local press published a dementi from the Afghan Embassy stating that the reports of Afghan raiding were devoid of truth. The newspapers replied that the dementi was not convincing and that the facts were as stated. 272. When this news reached Kabul, the Afghan Government insisted that the mixed commission should consist of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Ambassadors of the two countries. Kazemi was unable to go as he was due at Geneva, and finally Persia was represented by the Governor-General of Khorasan and the Under-Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior. 273. At the close of the year no news had been received of the results of the mixed commission, nor had the decision of the Turkish arbitrators been published. (2) Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. 274. Perso-Soviet relations during the year were almost entirely commercial and are dealt with in section IV (B) (7). 275. Large numbers of refugees continued to cross the frontier and their treatment gave rise to complaints by bodies formed to assist them. There is no doubt that the Persian Government is seriously embarrassed by this influx and that the way in which the refugees are treated leaves very much to be desired. (3) Turkey. 276. At the end of December 1933, the Turkish Ambassador in London explained to the Foreign Office that the project for a Near Eastern Pact (see paragraph 98 of the annual report for 1933) had again been revived. It was hoped that Great Britain, the U.S.S.R., Turkey, Persia, Iraq and Afghanistan31 would join it. He was informed that in the view of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom enough pacts of this nature already existed, and that it was felt that the project would add nothing to the Covenant of the League and the Kellogg Pact. It nevertheless appeared possible that the Turkish Govern ment still have hopes that the pact may be signed. 277. During the year the joint commission for the delimitation of the Turco-Persian frontier, which had started work in 1932, at last completed its task. 278. In May it was officially announced that the Shah would pay a State visit to Turkey. He duly left early in June and was absent for about a month. He travelled via Tabriz, Erzerum and Trebizond, where he embarked on the battleship Yavuz (ex-Goeben) for Samsun, where a special train was waiting to bring him to Angora. 279. Immense efforts were made by the Turkish Government to ensure the success of the visit; 600 miles of road were repaired or rebuilt, houses on the route were refitted and furnished and elaborate catering arrangements were made. 280. On his arrival at Angora he was greeted by the Ghazi, and a round of entertainments followed at which fulsome speeches were exchanged. 281. The Shah then proceeded to Smyrna, where he attended manoeuvres, visited the Dardanelles and then spent a week at Constantinople. He finally left by sea for Trebizond and returned to Persia by the same route. 282. The importance of the visit has been dealt with in section III (A) of this report, and little more need be added here. The visit has probably done something to strengthen the bonds between Turkey and Persia, and, quite apart from officially inspired enthusiasm, it is fair to say that it aroused great interest in Tehran. The Minister for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Minister that economic questions had been discussed, and that the chief decision was to put the Trebizond route in order, thus, it was hoped, making available a new outlet for Persian goods independent of the U.S.S.R. 283. One minor result of the visit is of interest. On the outward journey the Shah was accompanied by Husrev Bey, the Turkish Ambassador, but while at Angora it was arranged that Husrev Bey should not return to Tehran, and that his place should be taken by Enis Bey, then Turkish Minister at Athens. No reasons were given for this sudden step, hut it is probable that Husrev Bey’s forceful conduct as Dean of the Diplomatic Corps, in which position he fought hard in the interests of his colleagues, had embarrassed and irritated the Persian Government. Enis Bey accompanied the Shah on his return journey. (4) Sweden. 284. The only event of importance in Perso-Swedish relations was the visit in November of the Crown Prince, who was accompanied by the Crown Princess, Prince Bertil, Princess Ingrid, the Swedish Minister at Moscow, Baron Gyllenstierna (who is also accredited to Persia), and other members of their suite. 285. The Royal party reached Tehran from Bagdad via Kermanshah and Hamadan, and underwent a series of formal entertainments. They visited various factories and inspected archaeological diggings and museums in which His Royal Highness is particularly interested. 286. His Royal Highness, leaving the rest of the party in Tehran, paid a hurried visit to Mazanderan, after which the whole party, with the exception of Princess Ingrid, who was ill with tonsilitis, proceeded to Isfahan and Persepolis. They finally left the country via Isfahan, Sultanabad, Hamadan and Kermanshah. 287. The chief characteristic of the visit was the intense formality to which the Royal party were subjected, and the inefficiency, in spite of great effort, of the arrangements made for them, from which they were not permitted to deviate by a hair’s breadth. The visit served as a further example of the notorious inferiority complex of the Shah and Persian officialdom as a whole.(5) Germany. 288. In April the Court of Appeal upheld the verdict of the lower court under which Dr. Lindenblatt (see paragraph 103 of the annual report for 1933) was convicted of peculation and his five German assistants acquitted. 289. Herr Walter Horschitz-Horst, who had succeeded Dr. Lindenhlatt, did not long survive him. The circumstances of his departure were tantamount to dismissal, but were disguised as the non-renewal of his contract, though the press explained that Tie left the country without a stain on his character. The reason generally given for this step was that the Shah considered £5,000 a year to he more than any foreigner was worth. 290. Herr Horschitz-Horst’s place was taken by Colonel Reza Quli Khan Amir Khosrovi. The German chief accountant was also replaced by a Persian. (6) Belgium. 291. In pursuance of the policy of getting rid as fast as possible of foreign advisers, regardless of whether Persians are capable of taking their place, the Persian Government dispensed with the services of several Belgian officials during the year. 292. The first to go was M. Leon Smets, the Treasurer-General. No reason was given for this step which came as a surprise to M. Smets himself, who on his departure expressed himself as pessimistic on the subject of the financial future of Persia. Four Belgian officials are still employed in the Ministry of Finance. 293. The axe then fell on the Belgian customs officials, who have for so long run the Persian customs. It was announced, without warning, that the contracts of the eight officials would not be renewed, and they left the country almost immediately. At the same time it was learnt that the Persian Government were endeavouring to obtain the services of four Belgian advisers, who were, however, not to act in an executive capacity as in the past. 294. The press paid considerable tribute to the work of the Belgian officials “ who had trained Persians capable of succeeding them,” and M. Dekerckheer, the senior official, was granted a pension of some £280 a year. 295. This happy atmosphere was spoilt by the action of one of the officials, who, on his return to Europe, published an article in a Paris newspaper dealing with the abrupt dismissal of the Belgians, which he attributed to the rage of the Shah when shown a minute by M. Dekerckheer, in which the latter stated that no Persian officials were sufficiently trained or sufficiently honest to run the customs, and that they never would be until they were properly paid. 296. This article raised the inevitable storm in the Tehran press, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs suggested that the Belgian Minister express his regrets in writing to the Shah, which he duly did. Kazemi went on to say that while the Persian Government had publicly expressed their satisfaction with the services of the Belgian officials, they had in fact been guilty of serious irregu larities. M. Paternotte replied that if this were so, the Persian Government ought to insist on an investigation which might be conducted by the president of the Swiss high court as an impartial judge. Kazemi then dropped the subject. 297. M. Paternotte also confirmed that M. Dekerckheer’s minute had in fact been one of the causes of the dismissal of the Belgian officials. After this incident there was, needless to say, no further talk of the engagement of Belgian advisers for the customs, which are now entirely staffed by Persians. 298. In November a special embassy to announce the accession of His Majesty King Leopold III arrived in Tehran. The special ambassador, M. Ithier, who is the head of Electro-Beige, was accommodated with his party in a private house taken over hastily by the Persian Government. After five days of official entertainments the Ministry for Foreign Affairs made it clear that they had no funds left and that bills would be presented for any further expenses.33 299. In other ways, the course of the mission was not smooth. M. Ithier declined to give a reception, so the Persian Government, with their usual reciprocity, also refused to give one. It appeared that M. Ithier, who hoped to secure orders, was paying for the whole mission himself, so his desire to avoid expense is comprehensible. His tactlessness towards the Persians and his own Minister left a bad impression. (7) Japan. 300. Japanese interests during the year were entirely commercial, and are dealt with in section IV (B) (8) of this report. (8) United States of America. 301. A new United States Minister, Mr. W. H. Hornibrook, arrived in the early spring. He was considerably embarrassed, and Tehran society astonished, by the return of his predecessor, Mr. C. C. Hart, who surrounded himself with an atmosphere of mystery and seclusion. 302. It was finally learnt that Mr. Hart, together with Mr. Clapp, the American oil expert, who assisted the Persian Government during the Anglo^ Persian Oil Company dispute, represented the Inland Exploration Company ol New Jersey, and was endeavouring to obtain a concession for the bemnan oil-held. His offer of a royalty in the neighbourhood of 1,500,000 dollars produced a reply from the Persian Government suggesting 13 million dollars and after weeks ot discussion Mr. Hart left the country in August in the hope that time would bring the Persian Government to their senses. He announced his intention of returning to Persia after a few months via Afghanistan, where he is believed to be also negotiating for oil concessions. 303 Mr Hornibrook was further embarrassed during the year by the presence among the orientalists assembled for the Firdausi celebrations of Mr. Gunther, formerly the United States Minister at Cairo, who he believed, not without evidence, was endeavouring to queer his pitch. 304 The Ulen Company’s claim is dealt with in section II (A) (9) of this report. No progress was made during the year. (9) Italy. 305 During the year Italian firms secured contracts for some sections of ,he railway, and Italian workmen continued to arrive in Persia in large numbers. A&gt;ssiblv as a result of this the Lloyd Triestino Company decided to start a two- nonthly service from Italy to ports in the Persian Gulf. The first ship arrived n January It was not anticipated the British steamship companies would -uffer much from the competition of this new service, which was probably subsidised by the Italian Government. 306 The Italian Ambassador in London informed the Foreign Office that he Persian Government had ordered three scouting vessels of 28 tons each from Italian yards. 307 A new Minister, Signor V. Cicconardi, presented his letteis in April. (10) Netherlands. 308 The K L.M. continued to use the Persian coast route during the year md made no further suggestion that they might fly on the Arab side of the Gult. (11) Denmark. 309. The Danish Legation continued to be much occupied with the affairs )f the Kampsax consortium. 310. In February the Minister, M. Ove Engell, who is normally resident in Moscow arrived in'Tehran to present his letters. He spent some three weeks m PersTand then returned to the U.S.S.R., leaving the Legation m charge of M. Dinar Blechingberg.34 311. During the Minister's visit, a Perso-Danish treaty of friendship, establishment and commerce was signed on the 20th February. (12) France. 312. “Air France” continued to use the Persian coast route during the year, and no suggestion was made that they might transfer to the Arab side of the Gulf. 313. In December 1933 a Deputy asked in a parliamentary question in the French Chamber what steps the French Government were taking to safeguard the interests of the French shareholders in the Julfa-Tabriz Railway. He was informed, in reply, that the representations of the French Legation has as yet achieved nothing, but that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs were occupying them selves with the question. 314. The tenor of these observations did not escape notice in Tehran. A Deputy was put up to enquire the Minister for Foreign Affairs' views, and Kazemi replied that the original concession for the railway had never been approved by the Majlis, and pointed out that the Soviet Government had ceded all their rights in it. It was obvious that railways on Persian soil were the concern of Persia alone and that the Persian Government were under no obligation to foreigners. 315. Not content with this, the Persian press published a series of articles expressing surprise at the temerity of the French Government in pressing claims that were obviously untenable. One French paper having suggested that no French capital should be invested in Persia until these claims were settled, the Tehran press were at pains to point out that no French capital was in fact invested in Persia, which w r as perfectly capable of running its affairs without financial assistance from abroad. 316. In August the French consulate at Bushire, which was also charged with Dutch interests, was closed. 317. The French Minister, M. Gaston Maugras, was transferred in October, the Legation being left in the charge of M. Claude Clarac pending the arrival of M. Pozzi, the new Minister, who was expected early in 1935. (13) Greece. 318. On the 18th July, 1934, the charge of Greek interests in Persia, which had been assumed by His Majesty’s Legation on the 1st May, 1931, was formally handed over to the Turkish Embassy (see paragraph 129 of the annual report for 1933). The Turkish Embassy were supplied with all current files, eight in number. His Majesty’s Legation and consulates, in particular His Majesty’s consul at Tabriz, were thus relieved of a considerable volume of particularly tiresome work. (14) Other Countries. 319. The occasion of the Swedish Royal visit (see section II (C) (4)) was seized by two Ministers accredited to Persia to present their letters of credence. The Austrian Minister, Herr Buchberger, usually resides at Angora. The Finnish Minister, Baron Yrjo-Koskinen, is normally resident in Moscow. Owing to the absence of the Shah, he found himself in the unfortunate position of having to wait a month in Tehran before he could present his letters. Both Ministers left shortly afterwards. 320. Austria continued to be represented permanently by an honorary consul, Herr Ehlers (see paragraph 133 of the annual report for 1933). 321. Finland has no permanent representative and cannot be said to need one. 322. Dr. Fric took over the charge of the Czechoslovak Legation in March. His predecessor, Dr. Trcka, remained in Tehran as president of the (Persian) Skoda Company.35 (D) International. (1) League of Nations. 323. Early in the year a society for the support of the League of Nations was founded in Tehran. For some months the press published lengthy accounts of its meetings, but the enthusiasm soon died away. 324. In August the Persian Charge d’Affaires in London called at the Foreign Office to request the support of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom for the candidature of Persia for a seat on the Council. He was informed that His Majesty’s Government never pledged themselves in advance in such matters. In fact, His Majesty’s Government had no intention of supporting the candidature of Persia. A later newspaper report stated that Persia had withdrawn her candidature in favour of Turkey. 325.

III.— Internal Affairs (Political). (A) General. 327. Apart from those aspects of internal affairs dealt with elsewhere in the report, the internal history of Persia in 1934, as in any other year, is 80 bound up with the Shah’s doings that it is almost impossible to treat it undei various heads. 328. At the beginning of the year rumours persisted that the Shah had cancer, but as he did not proceed to Europe during the summer, it may be taken as fairly certain that if he is suffering from some disease it is not one that need or can be treated by specialists. 329. Apart from a visit to Meshed to inaugurate the Firdausi memorial, the Shah’s only long journey was to Turkey, his visit to Iraq having been cancelled. It is probable that he did not care further to prolong his first period of absence from his country since his accession. He was actually absent from Persia for about a month. 330. The Turkish visit, details of which are given in section I (C) (3), was important more for its effect on Persian internal affairs than for any great stride forward in Perso-Turkish relations. It is, however, probable, as has already been noted, that the Shah endeavoured to enlist Turkey’s support in his dispute with Iraq over the frontier. 331. As regards the effect of the visit on Persia, it must be remembered that for all practical purposes the Shah had never before left his country, and the impact on his mind of an intensely nationalist and half-westernised I ui key was inevitably immense. His nationalistic ideas have probably still furthei stiffened since his return, and it is certain that the frenzy of Western European window-dressing has increased to fever point. In general, the main effect of the visit was to quicken the tempo of every undertaking in which the Shah is interested. As he has a finger in practically every pie, the whole movement towards westernisation is faster and more hectic than it was before. T he visit was made the occasion of countless articles in the I ersian pi ess, extolling the Shah as the father of his country and eulogising Turkey and things Turkish. 332. It was said by some that the Shah’s manner had softened since his return, and that contact with an outside world which owed no submission to him had opened his eyes. It is, however, probable that these eftects soon wore off, and it is certain that his touchiness and irascibility, where foreign press comments (with the possible exception of Russian articles) are concerned, are as great as ever. Strenuous efforts by the Foreign Office and a certain modicum of good luck prevented any really serious outbursts, but the Royal indignation was aroused by an article in the Times in which Mr. Robert Byron, who had lately been in Persia, referred en passant to the 1907 agreement. The new Persian Minister in London had just arrived, and, in order not to render his position impossible at the outset of his tenure of the post, the Foreign Office decided to depart from their usual practice and persuaded the Times to insert a laudatory leader, the ostensible cause of which was the Firdausi millenary. The mention of a Qajar princeling in the British press was the cause of a considerable campaign of vilification in the Tehran newspapers just before the visit to Turkey. 333. The Shah’s tendency to take over personally industrial undertakings of every kind and to increase his estates was particularly noticeable during the year The most striking example is the Royal mill at Shahi, in which the Shah takes an immense personal interest and which is run by what is practically indistinguishable from slave labour. Quite apart from the railway, money is beino- poured out in Mazanderan and Guilan, which are now largely owned by37 the Shah. The coast road and bridges are justifiable expenditure, but the wastage on such items as the Chalus Road, the new port at Deh Nou and the huge hotels in course of erection along the coast is immense. 334. The financial stringency and the stagnation of trade must have increased the general discontent in the country, but this is not yet vocal and cannot be considered to have reached dangerous proportions. Except in East and South-East Persia the country was quiet and security good. It was probably this feeling of strength and of the weakness of the now almost disarmed tribes that had led the Shah late in the previous year to order the arrest of the Bakhtiari Khans (see paragraphs 443-451 of the annual report for 1933). These unfor tunates languished in jail during most of the year, though Mirza Ibrahim Khan Qawam (Qawam-ul-Mulk), who was incarcerated at the same time, was released early in the year without trial and, so far as is known, without explanation. The ex-Minister of War, Sardar Asad, died in prison in March. Nothing further was heard of the other victims until the end of November, when the press announced that eight persons had been executed for treason and rebellion. Twenty others were condemned to varying terms of imprisonment and eight acquitted. Of those sentenced to death, only four were Bakhtiaris, the remainder being members of the Boir-Ahmedi, Qashqai and Mamassani tribes, who had taken some part against the Government in the troubled year 1929-30. 335. None of the proceedings of the military tribunal were published, so no light has been thrown on the accusations or the trials. On the whole, however, it appears certain that this wholesale punishment was not the result of any recent plot, but was due to the fact that the Shah at last felt himself strong enough to deal drastically with all who had had any part in the 1929 rebellion, pardons notwithstanding. The most independent of the tribes has now been drastically punished, without, be it noted, any repercussions and, while the Shah has shown that no reliance can be placed on his safe-conduct, the security of the dynasty has perhaps been furthered. 336. Throughout the year the Valiahd remained at school near Lausanne. He was visited during the summer by his mother, the Queen, who travelled via Russia, Poland and Germany. She was accompanied by her two daughters and her youngest son. (B) Officials, &amp;c. (1) Cabinet. 337. Feroughi’s Cabinet continued in office throughout the year, the only ministerial changes being as follows :— Muhammad Khan Nakhjevan (Amir Muvassaq) was appointed Acting Minister of War on the 5th August, thus filling the vacancy caused by Asad’s imprisonment and death. Nizam-ud-Din Khan Hikmat (Mushar-ud-Dowleh) became Minister of Posts and Telegraphs on the 2nd October, in succession to Doulatshahi, who died at his post. (2) Governors-General and Governors. 338. The principal changes during the year were as follows :— Khorasan .—Mirza Fathullah Khan Pakravan (Amir-i-Arfa) was appointed in October. Azerbaijan.-^MivzSi Khalil Khan Fahimy (Fahim-ul-Mulk) was appointed in February. Mazanderan. —Mirza Agha Khan Divan-Begi was appointed in October. Kurdistan .—Asadullah Mirza Shams-ul-Mulk Arai was appointed in October. (3) Diplomatic Appointments Abroad. 339. The following changes took place :— London .—Mirza Hussein Khan Ala (Mu’in-ul-Vizareh) was appointed Minister in July.V”.TUW 38 Pai 'is .—Seyyid Hasan Khan Taqizadeh was recalled in February, but no successor bad been appointed by the end of the year.

Moscow .—Mirza Muhammad Khan Saed (Said-ul-Vizareh) was appointed Charge d’Affaires in February. (4) Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 340. The principal changes were the following :— The Russian section of the Ministry was taken over by Mirza Massoud Khan Moazed when Said-ul-Vizareh left for Moscow. Mirza Ali Khan Mutamedi was appointed acting head of the section which deals with British and American affairs. Mirza Jawad Khan Sineki was put in charge of the Eastern section which deals with Iraq, Turkey and Afghanistan. (5) Obituary. 341. The following well-known Persians died during the year :— Haji Khusraw Khan Ilkhan (Sardar Zafar), K.B.E. Haji Mehdi Khan Nasir-Isfandiary (Nasir-us-Saltaneh). (C) Legislation. 342. The following list gives the more important enactments passed during the year; it is taken from the Official Review of the Ministry of Justice (1) Law exempting from customs and other dues gold and silver imported on Government account. (2) Law assigning 450,000 rials’ credit for expenditure on convicts in prison. (3) Law regulating the competence of the courts of justice and the tribunal of the Ministry of Finance, in cases where their jurisdiction overlaps.

The millenary of the birth of the Persian epic poet Firdausi was celebrated during the month of October. More than forty foreign orientalists of varying degrees of eminence accepted the Persian Government’s invitation to attend the celebrations in Persia. After a week’s congress at the capital the orientalists who could afford the time were transported to Meshed, where further ceremonies took place. A costly mausoleum of marble had been erected at the poet’s supposed birth-place at Tus, and the Shah unveiled it in person in the presence of the distinguished foreign guests. 344. No expense was spared by the Government in ministering to the needs of the orientalists, and on the whole the millenary was a great success. The learned visitors survived, without a single casualty, the orgy of feasts, speeches, and sight-seeing, in spite of long and tiring journeys on Persian roads. As was to be expected, the millenary was turned into an excuse for advertising the glorious resurrection of Persia under the rule of Reza Shah, and the press excelled itself in fulsome adulation. (2) Nomenclature. 345. The Persian Government announced during the year their decision to name their country “ Iran ” instead of “ Persia,” “Perse,” &amp;c. From a circular issued to their foreign representatives it appears that the proposal emanated from the Persian Legation in Berlin. The arguments employed were (1) that “ Perse ” &amp;c., refers to only one part of the vast “ Iranian ” area; (2) that, Iran being the birthplace of the Aryan race, the fact should be recorded in its name; (3) the name “Perse” recalls the days of servitude and shame suffered by the country before the Pahlavi dynasty. Foreign countries have been requested to bring the new name into use as from the beginning of the Persian year 1314 (22nd March, 1935). (3) Bahai Schools. 346. On the 9th December the Persian Government closed the Bahai “ Tarbiat ” schools at Tehran; and subsequently Bahai schools at Kashan, Kazvin, and other towns were similarly closed. The official announcment issued by the Ministry of Education attributes the closure to the fact that the schools did not obey an order not to close their schools on the 6th December, the anniversary of the death of the Bab. 347. It appears that the Bahais had referred to their spiritual head, Shauqi Effendi (who lives at Haifa), the question whether the orders of the Ministry of Education were to be obeyed on this day. The answer was that in the matters of school administration the Ministry was always to be obeyed, but that the celebra tion of the Bahai holiday on the 6th December was one which did not concern the Ministry of Education. The schools therefore celebrated the day as a holiday in defiance of the Ministry. 348. More than 1,500 boys and girls in Tehran are affected; and a much greater number in the provinces. The Ministry of Education seem to have endea voured, in various ways, to find places for the students, and employment for the teachers, in other non-Bahai schools. (4) Pars News Agency. 349. In April the Ministry for Foreign Affairs warned the Legation verbally that a note would shortly reach them to the effect that foreign Legations might not, in future, circulate their news sheets outside the Legation itself. They would be allowed to retain their receiving sets on condition of reciprocity. “Radio-concerts,” i.e., broadcasting receivers, were not included in this ban. 350. Three weeks later the establishment of a national news agency, to be called the Pars Agency, was made public. This agency was to receive the wireless bulletins of foreign news agencies and deliver them direct to the local newspapers, which were henceforth forbidden to publish the Legation news sheets.■■ Mi 40 .^^1- This step was reported to the Foreign Office and His Majesty’s Minister was informed that great importance was attached to the dissemination of the British Official News as opposed to Keuter’s and that he should make every endeavour to ensure that it received a wide circulation. The Legation news sheets were, therefore, still forwarded to subscribers. It was learnt privatelv that, as was only to be anticipated, the new agency was run so inefficiently that the greatest difficulties were experienced by the newspapers. 352. Only in August did the threatened note reach the Legation. It was stated that foreign Legations could only maintain wireless sets on condition of reciprocity and on condition that they had prior permission from the Persian Government. His Majesty’s Legation was, therefore, requested to give details ot their installation and to state the conditions obtaining in Great Britain. The Legation were also requested, in view of the formation of the Pars Agency, to cease circulating their news to the public. The Pars Agency would nevertheless be glad to receive any interesting news. 353. In reply to this note His Majesty’s Minister stated that the Minister tor Foreign Affairs would be aware of the position in London since the Pprsian Charge d’Affaires there had made enquiries on the point some months previously. He continued that he would be glad to arrange that copies of the British news reached the Pars Agency and alluded to a conversation with Kazemi at which the latter had stated that the news would be issued to the public in extenso. 354. In his reply, Kazemi thought fit to deny that he had ever made anv such statement. He indicated that the Persian Charge d’Affaires had not yet reported to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs the result of his conversations in .ondon, and made it clear that the Pars Agency would use its discretion as to what news it published. It also appeared probable that the Ministry for Foreign Allairs were going to press for an application for permission by the Legation 5 &amp; to maintain a wireless set. &amp; 355. His Majesty’s Minister expressed his regret that the Pars Agencv would not even go to the trouble of collecting the British news and announced that he would send it round to them. At the same time he informed the Minister for roreign Affairs that foreign missions in London were allowed to maintain receiving but not transmitting sets. Details of the Legation set were also lurnisned, but no application was made for permission to maintain it 35b. Some weeks later the Ministry for Foreign Affairs enquired whether this last note was to be construed as an application for permission and His Majesty s Minister referred to the Foreign Office, who had been kept m eourarU tor instructions. ’ 357. He was informed that in London the maintenance of wireless installa tions was regarded as being covered by diplomatic privilege and that no formalities were required. No objection would be raised if the Persian Legation distributed the I ars Agency bulletin. His Majesty’s Minister so informed the Minister for loreign Affairs and expressed the hope that the Persian Government would behave in a reciprocal manner as regards the wireless set maintained by IDs Majesty s Legation, the Persian Government did not revert to this matter and the Legation continued to circulate its news to the foreign colony as before. 358 The question of the publication in the press of the British News remained open as His Majesty’s Minister preferred to allow some time to elapse after his last note before pressing the Persian Government further. 359. Meanwhile the Persian Government had taken the precaution of regularising the position by passing a law laying down the conditions on which wireless sets might be imported and installed. (5) Foreign Doctors and Midivives. 360. During the year regulations of the utmost complexity were passed by the 1 ersian Government, laying down the conditions under which foreign doctors and mid wives might practise m Persia. The Legation found itself, in conse quence, fully occupied with the task of obtaining for British doctors and midwives41 the necessary licences. The difficulties and complications that arise in almost every case were innumerable, but they were largely due to red tape rather than to deliberate obstruction. (6) Flags. j &amp; 361. Not until late in the year did the Persian Government revert to the question of flag-flying by foreign missions and consulates, referred to in para graph 161 of the annual report for 1933. Kazemi then approached the Afghan Ambassador, as dean of the Diplomatic Corps, and enquired whether heads of missions were prepared to fall in with the views of the Persian Government, lie made it plain that he was asking a favour and not formulating a demand. A meeting was held to discuss this question, at which it transpired that the Turkish Government, who had no doubt been approached during the Shah’s visit, had-instructed their Ambassador not to fly the Embassy.flag every day. After some discussion it was agreed that, as a favour, flags would only be flown on national holidays, such days to be decided by each head of mission independently. The flags of His Majesty’s Legation and consulates are therefore now flown only on Sundays and certain British, foreign and Persian holidays. (E) Sheikh of Mohammerah. 362. The sheikh continued to live at Tehran throughout the year. The Ministry of Finance made no further communication to him concerning the scheme for the exchange of his properties in Khuzistan. The sheikh’s one desire appears to be to obtain permission to leave Persia and receive treatment in Europe for his diseased foot, which keeps him a prisoner in bed. 363. Towards the end of the year it was decided by His Majesty’s Govern ment in the United Kingdom that the advance of 50,000 rupees which the sheikh made some twelve years previously to the Government of India for the construc tion of the Ahwaz consulate on what is known as the “ sheikh’s site ” should be repaid to him in return for a release from the sheikh waiving all further claims in connexion with the site. It appeared, however, that the sheikh still regarded himself as the true owner of the site, and was therefore not prepared to sign away his claim thereto. 364. Negotiations have meanwhile been proceeding at Bagdad and London concerning compensation payable to the sheikh in respect of the “ istihlak ” tax; an annual payment to the sheikh by His Majesty’s Government being suggested. IV.—Internal Affairs (Economic). (A) Finance. (1) Budget 1934-35. 365. The budget for the Persian year 1313 (ending the 21st March, 1935), was passed on the 4th March. The current budget provides for a revenue of 621,413,417 rials (£7,767,668), and for expenditure of 621,307,865 rials (£7,766,348). These figures show an increase over the previous budget of about 114,500,000 rials (£1,431,265). The principal increases in revenue estimates are in respect of direct taxation 32 million rials (£400,000), indirect taxation 11 million rials (£137,500), customs receipts 18 million rials (£225,000), and monopoly revenues 24 million rials (£300,000). 366. The Ministry of War again accounts for the largest item of expendi ture with about 230 million rials (£2,875,000), about 37 per cent, of the total and 20 million rials (£250,000) more than last year. This item does not include a special credit of £2 million for the purchase of military supplies referred to below. 367. A new item of interest is a credit of 40 million rials (£500,000) for public industrial undertakings. 368. The single article approving the budget authorised the Ministry of Finance to pay from reserve funds for the purchase and improvement of military equipment the sum of £2 million.&gt;: •c ■ &lt;1 42 369. It should be noted that the national budget does not include the following items: royalties received from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, revenue from the sugar and tea monopoly tax, and that part of the road tax which is devoted directly to road construction and maintenance. (2) Taxation. 370. By a decree of the Council of Ministers dated the 25th February, excise taxes on locally-produced wines and spirits were increased. Imported drinks were not affected by this regulation. 371. In December the Majlis approved three new measures proposed by the Ministry of Finance. The first abrogated the registration tax on vehicles and imposed a tax of about 11^. per four-gallon tin on paraffin and petrol. Ihis tax is beneficial to owners of private cars, but will constitute an added burden on the motor transport industry. The paraffin tax will also constitute a hardship for the poorer classes, who use paraffin for lighting and heating. 372. The second measure, amending the Income Tax Law of November 1933, also adversely affects poorer people, and is an indication of the Govern ment’s urgent need of funds. By it the minimum taxable annual income is reduced from 5,000 rials (£62 10s.) to 2,400 rials (£30). 373. The third Bill abrogates previous legislation on the subject of the taxation of agricultural land, and substitutes therefor a uniform tax of 3 per cent, of the value of all produce actually marketed or exported. This measure has been well received, and will give relief to landowners, from the lowest to the highest. (3) Financial Situation. 374. An analysis of Persia’s total revenue and expenditure, including such items as are not usually shown in the national budget (e.g., Anglo-Persian Oil Company royalties, road tax, proceeds of sugar and tea monopoly tax and expenditure on railway construction), was given in the June issue of the bulletin of the National Bank. Total revenue is shown as 893,232,680 rials (£11,165,408) and expenditure 836,611,465 rials (£10,457,643). A surplus is thus shown of approximately 56-6 million rials (£707,755), and the conclusion is drawn that the present situation of Persian public finance is very healthy. Foreign obligations are negligible, and considerable liquid funds are held in addition, so that there is no need for foreign borrowing. 375. This statement of accounts is very helpful as far as it goes, and helps one to form a fuller picture of the national finances than is possible merely from the national budget. The credit balance of some £700,000 is achieved, however, by not taking into account the following important items of expenditure :— £ March 1934, vote for military supplies... ... 2,000,000 June 1934, vote for railway construction, (See. ... 400,000 July 1934, vote for industrial constructions ... 250,000 Recurring credit for agricultural industries ... 100,000 Total ... ... ... ... 2,750,000 If these items are taken into account, the excess of expenditure over revenue, and, consequently, the depletion of the national reserves, amounted to rather more than £2 million. The present amount of the Government’s foreign holdings is not known, but is generally considered to be about £3 million. Expenditure on railway construction alone in 1935 will amount to between £4 million and £5 million, but part of this will be met from the new bank notes which are to be printed. 376. The gold reserve has increased in value since last year owing to the higher price of gold, and now exceeds £3,500,000. Further purchases of gold were made in Persia, where the price was below the world price of the metal. The gold reserve is not at present available for meeting expenditure, as it has been transferred to the National Bank as backing for the increased note issue.43 377. The statement was current in the summer that in future the whole of the royalties from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were to be used for railway construction and military supplies. Any shortage, together with any other expenditures in foreign currencies, would therefore have to be drawn from the Government’s reserves. (4) 1911 Loan. 378. In August the Persian Government requested the Imperial Bank of Persia to agree to the receipts from the southern customs being credited to the Persian Government as and when received, against an undertaking by the Government to pay one month in advance the money required for the service of the loan. The bank agreed to release the customs receipts as they came in after the payment to them by the Treasury-General of a cheque for the full amount of the service of the loan due during the succeeding month. (5) Railway Finance. 379. During the summer it was generally understood that, owing to financial stringency, new construction on the southern section of the railway would be deferred for about eighteen months. There was a rumour of the possibility of a foreign loan, and then of payment for future work by a deferred payments system. These rumours were not confirmed, and it is understood that the Shah intervened and ordered that construction was to go ahead without any outside financial assistance. The contract for the important lot No. 6, in the south, was accordingly awarded in November to a Belgian group at a price approaching £1 million, a British firm failing by a narrow margin to secure this contract. 380. According to a private estimate made in the summer, the cost of the completion of the line, together with the acquisition of the necessary rolling-stock, would be about 1,080 million rials (£13,500,000), in addition to commitments in respect of work already in hand. 381. The National Bank bulletin in June gave the total income from the sugar and tea monopoly tax from its inception on the 30th May, 1925, until the 20th March, 1934, as 677,035,196 rials, and expenditure during the same period as 642,917,562 rials. There was thus a credit balance on the 20th March, 1934, of 34,117,634 rials (£426,470). This does not take into account a sum of £150,000 voted in November 1933 for the purchase of rolling-stock. 382. For the year 1934-35 two credits of 180 million rials (£2,250,000) and £400,000 were passed by the Majlis. Assuming an income of 95 million rials from the sugar and tea monopoly tax, and taking into consideration the two votes mentioned as well as the £150,000 vote referred to above, there will be a deficit in March 1935 exceeding £1 million. The peak year of expenditure will be 1935, when between £4 million and £5 million is to be spent on construction, besides further sums for the purchase of rolling-stock. 383. It is obvious that from now on the proceeds of the sugar and tea monopoly tax will meet only a small part of the cost of railway construction. Some of the additional funds required will no doubt be provided from the huge increase in note circulation already authorised, and the balance will have to be drawn from the royalties accruing from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company or from the national reserves of foreign currency held abroad. (6) Currency. 384. On the 11th September a Bill was passed authorising an increase in the note circulation beyond the previous legal maximum of 340 million rials (£4,250,000) to 800 miliion rials (£10 million). To this end the National Bank was authorised to order the printing of new bank notes to a value of 635 million rials (£7,937,500). In addition to the circulation of 800 million rials, the bank must keep in reserve, “ for replacement of worn notes,” additional notes to a value of 300 million rials (£3,750,000). Pending the receipt of the new notes, the bank was authorised to put into circulation additional notes to a value of 100 million rials (£1,250,000) previously held in reserve.&lt;— 44 » 385. By the new law the cover against the note issue must be not less than 60 per cent, in gold bars and silver, or 480 million rials (£6 million), against a maximum issue of 800 million rials bank notes. The present cover is understood to consist approximately of gold bars valued at 280 million rials (taken at £7 an ounce), silver bars and coins 423 million rials, and foreign exchange 37 million rials—^a total of 740 million rials (£9,250,000), or 92-5 per cent, cover. 386. Up to the end of the year the order for the new notes had not been placed, although negotiations were proceeding with several firms, including one British firm. The new notes are said to be intended mainly for the financing of public works. In view of the more than adequate cover, the official view was that exchange rates would not necessarily be affected, although there might be some appreciation in internal prices. During the year the circulation of existing notes increased continuously from 235 million rials on the 26th December, 1933, to 382 million rials on the 22nd December, 1934. (7) Exchange. 387. Exchange movements were rather less violent than in the previous year, the rate varying approximately between 74 and 82 to the £. For a considerable part of the year the prevailing rates bore little relation to that indicated by the world price of silver, nor were they fixed by the normal process of supply and demand. The new Persian director of the National Bank, Colonel Amir Khosrovi, pegged the rate for weeks at a time at whatever figure he thought suitable, bearing in mind the needs of the export trade and other considerations (e.g., purchase or sale of silver bullion) best known to himself. Thus, when the price of silver was 25s. an ounce and the rial rate ought to have been in the neighbourhood of 67 to the £, a rate of about 80 to the £ was fixed. The result was that a considerable amount of silver coins were smuggled abroad towards the end of the year, when the rate was suddenly altered to 76 to prevent further loss of silver. 388. The sharp rise in the world price of silver was, in fact, unwelcome to Persia, as was pointed out in the March issue of the National Bank bulletin. Fluctuating exchange rates, and particularly an unwanted appreciation of the rial in terms of foreign currencies, were jeopardising Persia’s struggling export trade. Towards the end of the year the National Bank, in its annual report for the financial year 1933-34 (March to March), reverted to the topic of the unwelcome dependence of Persia’s currency on the world price of silver, and recommended to the Government the adoption of the gold standard. Notwith standing this recommendation, it is not thought likely that action will be taken in this sense in the near future. The existence in circulation of very considerable quantities of silver coins would alone make this step very difficult. Smuggling of silver abroad would undoubtedly increase if the rate were fixed at some figure acceptable to the export trade, whereas the latter would suffer considerably if a value in the neighbourhood of the present silver point were taken as the basis for the new rate. 389. The customs gold surcharge continued in force, and the Persian Government were again notified in August of the view of His Majesty’s Govern ment in the United Kingdom that the surcharge was an infraction of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty. A reply was received in September denying that there was any breach of the treaty stipulations. (8) National Bank. 390. At an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders of the bank held on the 11th March, Colonel Reza Guli Khan Amir Khosrovi was appointed managing director in place of Herr Walter Horschitz-Horst. Though the circumstances of Herr Horschitz-Horst’s departure were tantamount to his being dismissed, it was merely stated officially that his contract, which expired on the 12th March, 1934, was not being renewed. The new managing director had previously occupied the position of manager of the Pahlavi Bank, and had since been studying banking at Barclay’s Paris branch.45 *391. 1 he annual report of the bank, together with the balance sheet and profit and loss account for the year 1312 (March 1933 to March 1934), was submitted to the general meeting held on the 2nd October. The gross profits for the year were shown as 4,722,692 rials (£59,000) as compared with 5,898,367 rials (£73,730) in the preceding year. Net profit was somewhat smaller at 2,158,708 rials, and was distributed in the proportion of 80 per cent, to the credit of the special Government account, 10 per cent, placed to reserve and 10 per cent, carried forward. 392. I he report stated that the bank proposed to apply during the current year for the elaboration of new statutes enabling them— (a) 1 o acquire property abroad for their own or Government purposes and to establish branch offices abroad. (b) To fix the gold cover against the note issue at 33 per cent. (c) lo rediscount the bills of other banks under special conditions, in accordance with the bank’s position as a note-issuing bank. 393. It was also proposed to request the Government to pay the remaining 60 per cent, of unpaid shares and to increase the authorised capital. The Govern ment would be asked at the same time to pay a sum of 5,096,209 rials (£63,703) as ci final contribution towards the expenses of the bank during the first two years of its existence. Other important proposals contained in the report were the definite adoption of the gold standard and the organisation of a bourse. So far as is known, no decisions had been taken on these recommendations by the end of 1934, though the adoption of the gold standard, as already stated, now appears unlikely. (9) A gricultural Bank. 394. Branches of the Agricultural Bank were opened at Tabriz, Resht, Shiraz, Meshed and Isfahan during the year. The Shafagh Surkh of the 8th November published details of the proposed activities of the bank in the direction of encouraging agriculture and industry in the country. Credits will be granted for the improvement, development’ and extension of industrial projects, and co-operation will be afforded to producers with a view to improving agricultural products, particularly such as are suitable for export, or for replacing imported products. (B) Trade. (1) Trade in General. 395. I he state of trade continued to be unsatisfactory throughout the year. During the summer several bankruptcies were reported from various parts of the country, and other firms closed down as business became less profitable. Increasing Government intervention in trade, and the creation of monopolies or negotiation of barter arrangements, made the position of individual traders more and more difficult. 396. Transport was somewhat better, as the active construction of the railway and the prosecution of various public works provided a fair amount of employment. The motor trade benefited by the decrease to 20 per cent, (and 10 per cent, for spare parts and tyres) of the amount of exporters’ exchange which had to be bought against imports. A considerable increase in imports of motor vehicles took place, in spite of considerable uncertainty as to the Govern ment’s intentions regarding the constitution of an import monopolv. The monopoly scheme was, in fact, revived in December, but was again dropped. The tax on petrol at the end of the year created further hardship for motor transport, and some anxiety was also felt regarding the effect on the industry of the proposed bulk transport of Anglo-Persian Oil Company products in tank lorries owned by the company. 397. Exports continued to decrease in spite of all the efforts made to stimulate them, and the adverse trading balance (excluding oil shipments) grew considerably. Imports were higher in terms of rials and still more so in terms*9-F“ 46 of sterling, a large part of the increase being apparently due to huge impoi s on Government account. A certain amount of overvaluation of impoi ts an undei- valuation of exports may account for some, but by no means all, or ic wide margin between the two figures. 398. The increased import quotas introduced in November 1933 weie, for the most part, retained for the economic year 1934-35, with the impoi ant exception of cotton piece-goods, for which an import monopoly was cieated. 399. Some alleviation of the tightness of the money market was produced by a large increase in the note circulation, and considerable quantities ot the newly coined silver rials were also put into circulation. (2) Municipal Activity. 400. In Tehran considerable activity prevailed, particularly after the return of the Shah from his visit to lurkey. Streets are being widened, old buildings torn down and new ones erected with incredible rapidity. Appreciable progress has been made in street paving and asphalting, some of the latter being of very poor quality. Orders are being placed for road-making machinery, and tenders were called for for further asphalting and paying on a large scale. Shop window displays are improving, more adequate electric lighting is to be provided and a municipal flour mill is planned. Much of this activity is presumed to be window-dressing for the anticipated official visit of Mustapha Kemal in 1935, but no progress has been made towards providing such essential requirements as a sewage system or the canalisation of the drinking water supply. (3) Balance of Trade (1933-34). 401. According to preliminary and approximate figures published by the Department of Commerce, and the Persian customs bulletins, the balance of Persia’s international trade during the year ended June 1934, as compared with the previous year, was as follows : — (In thousand rials and sterling equivalent.) — 1932-33. 1933-34. Increase or Decrease. Imports 660,277 847,149 Ker cent. + 2H • 3 (£6,719,000) (£10,471,557) 4 55*8 Exports— General 535,591 460,000 14*1 (£5,450,198) (£5,686,032) 4 4*3 Oil 1,133,662 1,337,615 4 18*0 (£11,536,196) (£16,534,178) 4 43*3 'total exports .. 1,669,253 1.797,615 4 7*7 (£16,986,394) (£22,220,210) 4 30*8 Total trade 2,329,530 2,644,764 4 13*5 (£23,705,403) (£32,691,767) 4 37*9 Excess of gross exports (including oil 1,008,976 950,466 6*0 shipments) over imports (£10,267,385) (£11,748,653) 4 14*4 Trade balance, excluding oil shipments .. - 124,686 (£1,267,792) — 387,149 (£4,785,525) Kates of conversion: 1932-33 rials = £1. 1933-31 80*90 rials = £1. 402. The official explanation of the large adverse balance is that it consists entirely of goods imported on Government account (including gold bullion to a value of 143 million rials) or by the various concessionnaires entitled to import goods without corresponding export obligations. If these items are excluded, it is claimed, the trading account would approximately balance at about47 460 million rials. This explanation is unsatisfactory, but as the whole basis of calculation for assessing the balance is unreal, it is not worth while to discuss it here. (4) Anglo-Persian Oil Company's Trade. 403. I he following figures, supplied confidentially by the Tehran office of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, show the activities of that concern during the year ended June 1934. Comparative figures for the preceding year are also given :— 1932-33. 1933-34. £ £ Non-dutiable imports 331,149 720,159 Dutiable imports 76,509 57,970 Total imports 407,658 778,129 Local expenditure 220,140 124,350(‘) Royalties paid to Persian 627,798 902,479 Government Oil shipments (in tons)— 2,004,483 (not available) Cargoes 5,646,759-8 6,362,427-3 Bunkers 438,414 2 485,970-7 6,085,174 6,848,398 0) This figure shows a net decrease in exchange sales, presumably due to larger receipts in rials accruing from augmented sales of oil products within Persia. (5) Imports. 404. The Customs tableau general for the economic year has not yet been published, and such figures as are given are preliminary and approximate only. Although the value of total imports given above include non-dutiable goods, those given for imports and exports by countries are exclusive of non-dutiable imports and of mineral oil exports. 405. Imports from the Soviet Union declined to 17 per cent, of the total, as compared with about 25 per cent, last year. Imports from the United Kingdom further fell from 10 per cent, to 7 4 per cent, of the total. The value shown, 63 million rials (rather less than £800,000), is, of course, only a part of actual United Kingdom exports to Persia, which probably include the larger part of the non-dutiable imports of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company recorded above. Imports from Japan again rose sharply, and constituted 9-7 per cent, of the total, and those from India fell from 10 per cent, to 7-4 per cent. 406. Imports of cotton piece-goods declined from 168 million rials (£2,100,000) to 140 million rials (£1,750,000), Soviet, United Kingdom, Indian and Italian goods all losing ground to Japanese. The cotton goods imports are— 1932-33. Rials. O &gt; approximate figures of 1933-34. Rials. Japan 32,957,000 57,760,000 U.S.S.R. ... 71,384,000 37,403,000 United Kingdom 32,674,000 21,287,000 India 12,497,000 11,247,000 Italy 14,178,000 3,196,000 407. Imports of cotton yarn were lower, no doubt largely as a result of the activity of the new spinning mills which are now operating in some districts. Woollen goods imports were also smaller by about 21 per cent., but the United Kingdom share was only very slightly less, those of Belgium and France showing larger declines. The bulk of the motor trade was again handled by the United States, United Kingdom imports taking second place with a very much smaller value.~r- 1-8 (6) Exports. 408. Exports to the Soviet Union were about 19 per cent, of the reduced total, about the same proportion as last year. Those to the United Kingdom were slightly lower than last year at 12-3 per cent., and to India also 12-3 per cent.—somewhat better than last year. Germany took 14-4 per cent, of the total, as against only 84 per cent, last year; and Japan’s share also was higher at 31 per cent., against 0-8 per cent, last year. 409. Exports of woollen carpets fell from 181 million rials to 141 million rials. These went mainly to the United States, 57-9 million rials (£724,450); United Kingdom, 24-9 million rials (£311,525); and Turkey, 19-9 million rials (£248,750). Germany was the largest buyer of cotton, the Soviet Union, Japan and India following in that order. (7) Soviet-Persian Trading Relations. 410. As a result of the exchange of notes of the 10th December, 1933, Soviet trade with Persia, began to revive. Much ground had been lost, however, and Japanese encroachments on the market for cotton piece-goods had been most severe. In order to recover some of this ground and to compete with Japanese prices, Soviet trading institutions began to offer discounts varying between 15 and 25 per cent. 411. In May a M. Iliava, of the Soviet Foreign Trade Commissariat, visited Tehran, but it was denied that trade negotiations were taking place. Towards the end of September, however, it became known that a commercial agreement had been reached between the two countries. The following are understood to have been the main terms of the agreement:— (1) The Soviet Union undertook to purchase the rice crop at a price of 10 rials per pood, as compared with 9 rials the previous year. The Persian Government, however, agreed to make a rebate of 1 rial per pood, thus, in effect, subsidising the rice export to that extent. (2) The Persian Government undertook to purchase from the U.S.S.R. up to 50,000 tons of sugar during the present economic year, or 10,000 tons more than last year. (3) The Persian Government undertook to purchase from the U.S.S.R. cotton piece-goods up to a value variously stated as 75, 60 and 50 million rials, the latter figure being more probable. This purchase was to be effected in accordance with the new cotton goods monopoly, the monopoly tax of 15 per cent, being charged in the same way as on imports from other countries. This undertaking protects Soviet cotton goods to a certain extent against further Japanese encroachments. 412. Further details are now known, although none have been published, regarding the previous agreement of December 1933. In addition to the under takings by Persia to buy 40,000 tons of sugar, and by the Soviet Union to buy rice at an agreed price, an agreed basis was fixed for the calculation of the c.i.f. and f.o.b. prices of certain stipulated commodities entering into trade between the two countries. The Persian Government undertook to supplement the Soviet import quotas of such goods as had been or might be removed from the prohibited list of imports. An agreed basis was fixed for the adjustment of the trade balance between the two countries for the two and a half years from June 1931 to December 1933. The agreement was to have a life coterminous with the validity of the 1931 treaty, and was to be recognised by both Governments as constituting a settlement of all trade differences between the two countries. 413. Taken together, these two agreements seem to settle most of the legiti mate grievances of both countries, and are likely to lead to a considerable development of commercial exchanges which must benefit Persia. Nothing more has been heard during the year of the inspired protests and complaints of Persian merchants and chambers of commerce against Soviet trading methods, and they no doubt now realise, if they had not done so before, that their individual prosperity and that of the country as a whole is largely dependent on satisfactory trading relations with the Soviet Union.49 (8) Japanese Trading Activities. 414. Japanese activity continued unchecked throughout the economic year (June 1933-June 1934), and as a result mainly of increased sales of cotton piece- goods, Japan rose for the first time to second place in the list of exporters to the Persian market. In respect of cotton yarn, however, sales were reduced, partly as a result of local production and partly owing to a certain recovery in Indian sales. 415. Japanese trade with Persia was again very one-sided, imports being 82 million rials and exports little more than 14 million rials. In addition to cotton piece-goods valued at 57-7 million rials, Japanese imports to 1 ersia included cotton yarns valued at about 8 million rials, earthernware 2 million rials, glassware i million rials, woollen goods 760,000 rials and tea 528,000 rials. 416. Having made her peace with the Soviet Union, Persia is no longer content to allow the Japanese to sell so much and buy so little. The import monopoly for cotton piece-goods is believed to have been designed largely to reduce imports of these goods from Japan. With normal development of poviet- Persian trading relations, it is likely that Japanese enterprise m Persia will suffer a set-hack, but their low prices will probably enable them to compete advan tageously with non-Soviet goods, unless Persian measures to ensure a more favourable balance of trade with Japan are made much more effective. 417 Four Japanese ships visited Persian Gulf ports during the eleven months ending November 1934 and in December it was reported that the Nippon Yusen Kaisha and Shoshen Kaisha combine had commenced the operation of a monthly service from Japan to the Persian Gulf, the first vessel being due at Basra in January 1935. Outward and homeward freights are to be only between Far Eastern and Persian Gulf ports, competition with the British Imba trade between India and the Gulf being thus avoided. 418 Negotiations for a Japanese concession to exploit salt deposits near Charbar were reported to have fallen through. A rumour that the Japanese were negotiating for the concession of the red oxide deposits at Hormuz was not confirmed. (9) Italian Activities. 419 Italian participation in railway construction was reported in paragraph 589 of the report for 1933. Large numbers of Italian workmen arrived in Persia in the course of last year in connexion with these contiacts. A soeech bv Signor Mussolini early in the summer expressing keen Italian interest i„ and affinities with the Near and Middle East was not particularly well received in Persia and it was rumoured at the time that no more Italian workmen would be allowed to enter the country. This rumour was not substantiated and further parties of Italians have since arrived, but no further railway contracts have been awarded to Italian firms during the year. 420 An Italian group headed by a Signor Eibenstein visited Persia during the summer representing Italian financial and export interests They weie under” to be interested in the market for electrical equipment, cotton piece- goods (mainly gabardines), woollen yarns and mercerised cotton yarns, and the exnort from Persia of raw cotton, rice and skins. They were also interested m the call for tenders for the construction of a silk mill at Deh Noe, but the order was given to a French concern. 421 Renresentatives of the Levant Fair at Bari visited Persia in July in the course of a tour of the Near and Middle East, but it was stated at the time that Persia did not intend to be represented at the 1935 lair. 422 An Italian shipping line started a regular service of small cargo steamers to Gulf ports, but it was understood that this service was not likely to nreiudice or compete seriously with British shipping interests in the Gulf. It was later understood that the line was not a paying proposition, and that mysterious negotiations had been proceeding to obtain some form of 1 ersian assistance to enable the service to continue.50 (10) A mend merits to Trade Monopoly Law. 423. In January the importation of motor vehicles was authorised against purchase of only 20 per cent, of exporters’ dollar exchange (at 28-28 rials to the dollar), and tyres and spare parts against 10 per cent., plus 6 per cent, interest from the 22nd June, 1933. This measure represented a considerable alleviation of the excessive burden placed upon the motor trade. 424. On the 27th February the Majlis approved a law reducing from 95 per cent, to 85 per cent, the value for which import licences would be issued against export certificates, the reason given being the continued adverse balance of trade and the excessive fall in the price of export certificates. The decline in the price of the latter continued, however, and reached the low level of 7-5 per cent, in March. 425. In July a law was passed whereby the Government undertook to buy all export certificates at a fixed price. The National Bank was subsequently authorised to perform this function, and announced that it would buy the certificates at a fixed price of 9 per cent, and would sell them to persons desiring to obtain import licences at 13-5 per cent. The new measure, while increasing the cost of import licences, put a stop to excessive speculation in export certificates as we\\ as to the steady decline in their price. 426. The import quotas announced for the economic year 1933-34 showed little change from the previous year, except that no quota was authorised for the import of cotton piece-goods and cotton yarns. The institution of an import monopoly for cotton piece-goods was later announced, details of which are given in another section. No import quotas were sanctioned for sacks, sacking, rope, &amp;c., on the grounds of sufficient production within the country, nor of boot polish, presumably for similar reasons. In the case of some imports, a specified amount of exporters’ exchange had to be purchased at the official rates. 427. Signs were apparent of a change in the foreign trade policy of the Persian Government. That the foreign trade monopoly law had not succeeded in one of its main objectives, viz., the balancing of imports and exports by increasing the latter, became increasingly apparent. The National Bank even suggested, in its bulletin of March 1934, that import quotas might be abolished altogether whilst retaining the necessity for import permits based on equivalent exports. The weapon of the foreign trade monopoly law was, too useful to be abandoned, but a change in the method of its application could be tried. Thus a slump in the export of cocoons was met by awarding a monopoly of silk goods imports to a group formed to sell cocoons on a monopoly basis. The rice crops were disposed of to the Soviet Union against a Persian undertaking to buy certain quantities of cotton goods and sugar. Barter or clearing arrangements were discussed, and in some cases foreign firms undertaking important public works on behalf of the Persian Government or Tehran Municipality were obliged to give undertakings to export Persian produce. The cotton goods monopoly was said to be framed with the object of encouraging Persian exports to certain countries on a more or less barter system. An attempt, which appears to have been abandoned later, was made towards the end of the year to revive the flagging export of carpets by forming a carpet export monopoly and making the import of motor cars—also to be monopolised—dependent on export of carpets to an equivalent amount. 428. Thus while retaining the protection of the foreign trade monopoly law, the Government attempted to secure its better working by forming specific import monopolies with the object of artificially reviving certain specific drooping exports, and for the same purpose encouraged the development of barter schemes. The effect of all these restrictions built up on other restrictions was to make ordinary import and export trade also impossible, and many merchants abandoned the fruitless struggle. No signs of an impending change in the Government policy were, however, evident at the end of the year. (a) Cotton Piece-Goods. Monopolies. 429. In an attempt to improve the foreign trade balance it was decided towards the end of the summer to form a monopoly for the importation of cotton51 piece-goods. The idea is to import cotton goods on a barter basis against exports of Persian produce. In November a company called “ Societe par Actions des Cotonnades ” was set up under the auspices of and in the premises of the National Bank with a capital of 20 million rials (£250,000),' part of which has been subscribed by the bank. Applications for permits to import cotton goods must be submitted to the company, together with some indication of the nature and value of Persian produce which the applicant undertakes to export. A monopoly tax of 15 per cent, on all imports of cotton goods is levied by the Government, and in addition a commission of 5 per cent, is charged by the company. (b) SUk and Cocoons. 430. In September the Iran Trading Corporation were granted the monopoly of the purchase and export of silk cocoons as well as of the importation of silk cloth from abroad. In order to stimulate the flagging export of cocoons, the corporation were authorised to import 2^ metres of silk cloth against every kilogramme of cocoons exported. For the operation of this monopoly, the corpora tion have formed a company under the name of Silk Share Company with a capital of 3 million rials (£37,500), one-third of which is subscribed by the corporation and the remaining two-thirds made available for the public. (c) Tobacco Monopoly. 431. Dr. Friedlieb called on the commercial secretary in February and said that he was once more interested in the tobacco monopoly. He was aware that a French group had an option on the monopoly, but did not think that agreement would be reached. In this he was correct, as the Government finally decided to set up the monopoly without foreign capital, and Dr. Friedlieb was himself appointed technical adviser to the Government tobacco monopoly. A call for tenders for the construction of a cigarette and tobacco factory at Tehran was published in September. Two British firms have submitted tenders, but the result of the adjudication was not known at the end of the year. (d) Sugar. 432. At the end of October a notice issued by the Ministry of Finance provided for the establishment of special companies in all the principal towns of Persia for wholesale dealing in sugar. These firms would obtain their sugar from the sugar monopoly, and no other wholesale dealers in sugar would be permitted to function in the districts covered by the new companies. The latter had to undertake to purchase a definite amount of sugar annually, selling prices would be fixed, and a definite minimum amount of stocks was to be maintained. The monopoly were to have the right to inspect the books, stocks, &amp;c., of the companies. I he measure is intended to reduce illicit imports of sugar as well as to minimise price fluctuations. (e) Motor Imports and Carpet Exports. 433. About the middle of December it was announced that a monopoly company was to be formed for the importation of motor vehicles, together with a company for monopoly exportation of carpets and a third company for the operation of motor transport services. Imports of motor vehicles were to be regulated according to exports of carpets, which had fallen off considerably during the last few months. The National Bank was to take up 51 per cent, of the shares of the new companies, and the motor dealers were invited to take up the remaining 49 per cent, of the shares of the motor import company. This they were not disposed to do. One of the objects of the proposed monopoly was to reduce the excessive profits alleged to be made by motor dealers, to reduce prices and to apply some of the profits of the motor trade to assist the export of carpets. After prolonged discussions between the Government representatives and motor dealers, it was announced at the end of the month that the monopoly scheme had been abandoned for the time beine. and orders were sent to the customs to release consignments which had been held up pending a decision being reached on the monopoly question. Dealers were warned to be more careful in future about the amount of profit they tried to make, as the Government would keep a watchful eye on the motor trade. The fact that the motor trade in Persia is largely in the52 lands of foreigners, employs large numbers of foreigners and “'I® if its profits has long been a source of annoyance to the Government but the trade t . ,L,,,,1;,,.,t„,l and any hasty attempt to take it ovei might lead to £ g-, is .a complicated one and oi/~1 or»o I'il r»r^Ti i n Gl OTI (f) Red Oxide. 434 The concession for the exploitation of the red oxide at Hormuz, granted to the late Hajji Moin Bushiri in 1923-24 for a period of fifteen years, was rescinded in October, on the grounds of alleged non-payment of loyalt es c heirs of Bushiri appealed against the decision without success and a call toi tenders for the exploitation for three years of the Hormuz deposits was published in October. So far as is known, no tenders were received but the lepresentatiye of a British firm interested in the commodity visited lehran and is believed to have arrived at a tentative working agreement with the Ministry of Finance regarding the exploitation of the oxide. The same representative had previously secured an option on a concession for the working of the red oxide deposits on the island of Abu Musa. The Persian Government are not aware of the existence ot this option, and some form of protest from them is not unlikely if and w icn ley learn the news. (12) / ran Trading Corporation. 435 The corporation’s balance-sheet for the year ended the 20th March, 1934 showed a net profit of 2,141,440 rials (£26,768), and the average profit paid to shareholders was stated to be 25 per cent. Imports of sugar and exports of cotton and rice constituted the main activities of the corporation dui mg the yeai. 436. That the corporation’s importance is in the ascendant is shown by the grant to it in October of the monopoly of the export of cocoons and import pf silk coeds reported in a preceding section. It also participated, directly or indirectly, in other monopolistic or semi-monopolistic ventures instituted with Government support or encouragement. (C) Industry and Agriculture. (1) Industry : General. 437. Further progress is being made along the line of industrialisation, and there is an increasing tendency for all the more important new enterprises to be for Government or municipal account. All Government industrial undertakings have been placed under the control of the Department of Industry. By a regula tion issued in October, the permission of that Department must be obtained before any new privately-owned factories may be established. The object of this regulation was no doubt to prevent unnecessary competition between private enterprises, as well as to avoid excessive competition between private and State undertakings. 438. In addition to the specific developments referred to below, tenders were called for towards the end of the year for the equipment of a cigarette and tobacco factory at Tehran for the Government Tobacco Monopoly, and of a flour mill for the Tehran Municipality. Two tea-drying factories are to be acquired shortly for erection in Gilan for the Agricultural Bank. 439. The Government coal mine at Shemshak, near Tehran, was provided with additional equipment, and aerial ropeways are being obtained for another coal mine at Zirab in Mazanderan. Other coal mines in different parts of the country are being developed, but not on a large scale. A glass-making factory was established during the year at Tabriz, and a brewery at Tehran. 440. A well-arranged exhibition of Persian natural and industrial produce was opened at Tehran in the autumn, and is to remain open indefinitely. Similar local exhibitions were arranged in Meshed, Tabriz, Isfahan and other centres, and these apparently are also to be of a permanent nature.A V 53 AW- (2) T extile Mills. 441. The important order for a large cotton mill for Government account at Ashraf, mentioned in paragraphs 557 and 558 of the annual report for 1933, was awarded early in December, after protracted negotiations, to the German firm of Union Matex. The final price quoted by this concern was understood to be about 8 per cent, lower than that of their British competitors, and, in addition, they undertook to receive payment within the terms of a barter agreement, whereby Persian produce to a value equivalent to the amount of the order would be exported to Germany. The loss of this valuable order considerably weakens the possibility of British textile machinery firms building up a very strong position in Persia, as well as of obtaining the orders for additional mills on the same scale as that at Ashraf, which the Government intend to acquire in the near future. 442. The spinning mills at Shiraz, Isfahan and Yezd equipped by Messrs. Platt Brothers started work during the year, and an extension to the Isfahan mill has been ordered from the same firm. A licence to erect a spinning mill at Kashan has been granted by the Department of Industry. The scheme for a mill at Bushire did not materialise, and negotiations are still continuing concerning the Meshed project {vide paragraph 556 of the annual report for 1933). 443. The jute mill at Resht is working satisfactorily, and is considered capable of supplying the whole present needs of Persia in respect of sacks and sacking material. 444. An order for a silk spinning and weaving mill at Deh Noe, at the Caspian terminus of the Chains Road, was placed in the autumn with the French concern of Ateliers Guillaume Diederichs, Sainte-Colombe-les-Vienne, Lyons. (3) Sugar Factories. 445. Two of the projected six new sugar factories were completed and started production in October, one at Shahi in Mazanderan and the other at Veramin. Construction of a third factory at Shahabad, near Kermanshah, and of a fourth at Mervdasht near Shiraz, was begun in the summer. These two factories are expected to start production next year. FAperimental cultivation of sugar cane is being carried out in the Karun Valley, where it is possible that a fifth factory, at Ahwaz, may be erected. It is also stated that the Shahi factory, though made for dealing with sugar beet, is also capable of treating a certain amount of sugar cane. 446. Reports on the autumn beet crop were favourable. The four factories now built or in course of erection will be able to supply a fair proportion of the needs of the country in present conditions, although in the absence of the crushing taxation on sugar levied in the interests of railway construction consumption would be from two to three times the present amount. (4) Match Factories. 447. A new match factory was erected at Zenjan and started production during the year. A company was formed at Tabriz with the object of establishing a new match factory in that town and a branch factory at Nisnapur. The equip ment of a match factory at Isfahan is also projected. 448. The important factory already existing at Tabriz belonging to Hajji Bagher Khoyi was destroyed by fire on the 2nd and 3rd December. Insurance of this factory had only been completed on the 1st December. Fifty per cent, of the insurance had been taken out with the Soviet concern of Gosstrakh, 25 per cent, with German firms, and the remaining 25 per cent, with three British firms. (5) Cement Factory. 449. A call for tenders for the extension of the cement factory near Tehran, with a view to doubling its capacity, was published in October. British firms appear to have shown little interest in this project, and the order will possibly go to the Danish firm of F. L. Schmidt and Co., who equipped the existing factory.(6) Tehran Electric Power Scheme. 450. The contract for the central power plant at Tehran is understood to have been placed, after protracted negotiations, with the Skoda group, which undertook to export Persian produce to a value equivalent to the amount ol the order. (7) Agriculture. 451. Attention is being concentrated on the technical crops forming a basis for industries, viz., sugar beet, tobacco, tea, jute. Branches of the Agricultural Bank were set up to encourage these productions, as well as silk, and financial assistance was given as well as encouragement for the formation of companies for development. 452. The sugar beet crop was more successful, the area under cultivation being 4,800 hectares, and production stated to be about 70,000 tons. In order to provide raw material for the new sugar factories under construction or planned, it is hoped to increase the area under beet to about 15,000 hectares by 1937. 453. To a certain extent the increase in beet cultivation is being effected at the expense of that of rice . The professed reason for this is a desire to combat malaria, but the real reason is believed to be that of finding a market in the interior of the country for the rice of Mazanderan, grown mainly on the Shah’s estates, and so to reduce the dependence on the Soviet Union, at present the only considerable buyer for the rice crops. 454. The area under tea in Gilan continues to increase under Government encouragement, and four Chinese experts are still employed for this purpose by the Government. A company with a capital of 3 million rials (£37,500) has been formed to develop tea plantations, and factories for drying the tea are being acquired. The encouragement of the Department of Agriculture is to a certain extent being undermined by the excessive zeal of the Ministry of Finance, as it was reported towards the end of the year that new taxation was discouraging further planting. Tea producers were also adversely affected by the new regula tion regarding packing of imported tea and of locally-grown tea. Previously they had mixed their tea with foreign tea, imported in bulk, in order to improve the flavour, but they are now being compelled to take their own tea to be packed under official supervision. Similar complaints regarding the taxation of locally-grown tobacco were also reported. 455. Press reports stated that the date crop in 1934 was 50 per cent, larger than that of 1933. His Majesty’s consul at Shiraz, however, reported that distress was being experienced in the Jahrum-Darab-Fasa area owing to the failure of the local date crop. 456. Owing to late and heavy rains in the spring, the wheat and barley harvests were well above average in most parts of the country. V.—Opium. 457. Early in the year the exclusive right to export opium was granted, as from the 2nd February, to the Persian Opium Export Monopoly Company, which was formed in Tehran with a capital of 20 million rials (£250,000). Of this sum 18 million rials (£225,000) was subscribed by the Government, provision for this sum being made in the budget for the current year. For shipments to Europe it is understood that a special rate of £112, delivered at destination, has been fixed, presumably for the chest of the usual size of 160 pounds; the export certificates for such shipments belong to the Monopoly Company. For shipments to the Far East a price of 6,500 rials (£81 5.9.) per chest is quoted, to which must be added a Government export tax of £60, making the price delivered at Bushire about £141 5s. Export certificates for these shipments, calculated on price plus tax, accrue to the exporters.458. Shipments from Bushire during the last three years were as follows (in cases) :— Destination. Licensed— 1932. 1933. 1934. Saigon 1,000 Macao 425 499 700 Formosa 150 Dairen 200 150 Keelung Amsterdam 181 100 Czechoslovakia 1 Hamburg 415 London 30 Marseilles 100 Total licensed 1,775 830 1,346 Unlicensed 3,281 600 Grand total ... 1,775 4,111 1,946 459. Nearly one-half of the licensed exports went to Europe, which suggests that some success is attending the Persian Government’s attempt to concentrate on the European rather than the Asiatic market. Total exports last year were small if compared with the statement of M. Pilossian, Director-General of the Persian Opium Monopoly, that Persia had at the beginning of 1934 export stocks amounting to 7,400 chests, which would increase by the end of the year to 11,400 chests. 460. M. Pilossian informed His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in February 1934, that the Persian Government were willing, provided the British, French, Japanese and Siamese opium monopolies in the Far East would guarantee to take up 4,000 chests of Persian opium annually, to ratify The Hague Convention and the Geneva Convention of 1925, and endeavour entirely to stop the export of opium for purposes of illicit traffic to China, Manchuria and elsewhere. 461. In December the Ministry of Finance informed the commercial secretary that, with the object of increasing their legitimate exports of opium to Western Europe, the Persian Government would be glad to consider an exchange of opium with some large British concern against imports of medical or chemical products. VI. —Communications. (A) Aviation. (1) Private Civil Flights. 462. During 1934 some forty private civil flights were made across Persia by aircraft registered in Great Britain. This figure does not include aircraft participating in the Melbourne air race (see below) which numbered nineteen. Many of the latter failed to reach Persia. 463. The Persian Government showed a disposition during the year to tighten up the regulations governing private civil flights. It was probable that they were led to take this course by the considerable number of pilots who arrived much later than originally specified and by the increasing number of demands for permission at short notice and changes of programme. At the end of the year discussions were proceeding with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs with a view to find a reasonable system. (2) The Melbourne Air Race. 464. His Majesty’s Legation were entrusted with the task of obtaining permission for the participants in this race, whether British or foreign. Theie were sixty-four entrants, but of these, only nineteen started, and many of the latter failed to reach Persia.56 465. The Persian Government showed themselves most accommodating, and made every effort to ensure that competitors were not delayed. None of the aircraft that landed on Persian aerodromes on the course reported any difficulties or delays. Of those that landed off the course, one, a British aircraft, was well received, everything possible being done for the pilots; the other, an American entry, was held up for some time, and the pilot complained vigorously of the delay to which he had been subjected. It subsequently transpired, however, that the delay was largely his own fault, and that, in any case, the aeroplane was in no condition to leave until it had been repaired by Anglo-Persian Oil Company mechanics. This did not prevent the State Department from instructing the American Minister to enter a protest against the difficulties experienced by the pilot. (3) Persian Civil Air Line. 466. It was rumoured during the year that an order had been placed with the De Havilland Company for ten aeroplanes to be operated by the Persian air force as a civil air mail service on the following routes : Tehran-Pahlavi, Tehran-Bushire, Tehran-Khaniqin and Tehran-Meshed. 467. No confirmation of this rumour had been obtained at the end of the year. (B) Railways. (i) Trans-Persian Railway. 468. During the year contracts for lots 12 to 15 in the northern section were awarded to Persian firms and lot 16 to a Graeco-Persian firm formed by Georgopoulos. In the southern section lot 5 was awarded to a Russian engineer named Kosakovsky, who is now backed by the French group Regie des Chemins de Fer. Lot 11 was given to the Belgian firm Societe coloniale de Constructions, whose tender was only ^ per cent, better than that submitted by a British firm. The remaining lots, 17 to 20 in the north (to Tehran), and 6 to 10 in the south (to Burojird), are expected to be given out during 1935. 469. The length of line in operation remains the same as at the end of 1933, i.e., from Bandar Shah on the Caspian to Shahi (about 127 kilom.), and in the south from Bandar Shahpour to Salehabad (about 250 kilom.). Track has actually been laid up to kilometre 190 in the north and 300 in the south. 470. It is anticipated that the northern section will be completed as far as Tehran by May 1937, and the southern section about two years later. Between Qum and Tehran the line will make a detour westward to tap the grain-producing area near Saveh; this will add about 30 kilom. to the alignment previously planned along the Qum-Tehran road. 471. The station at Tehran will be at the southern end of the Pahlavi Avenue on the site decided upon by the Poland mission in 1927. Work on the station will probably be started in 1935. 472. A British firm obtained an order for five locomotives and another for sixty covered trucks, both these orders being placed through the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. (2) Port Constructions. 473. The contract for the construction of a new port at Deh'Noe, the Caspian terminus of the recently completed Chalus Road, was obtained by the Dutch firm of Netherlands Port and Harbour Works, Amsterdam. 474. The Swedish firm Gas Accumulator Company were awarded the contract for the lighthouse, light buoys, &amp;c., required for the port of Bandar Shahpour. (C) Roads. 475. The budget allotment under this head for the year 1934-35 is 834,000 rials, or 31,380 rials less than last year’s provision.57 476. This sum is provided to defray the cost of the Ministry of Roads and Communications, and not to meet the cost of road construction. Road construc tion is paid for out of the road tax receipts and the amount received from the registration of motor vehicles. 477. In 1933-34 the receipts under these two heads amounted to 60 million rials, of which 12 million rials were expended in grants to municipalities, charitable institutions and public instruction and the balance of 48 million rials was spent on road construction. Supplementary grants were also made, and no less a sum than 72 million rials was actually spent for this purpose. 478. For the year 1934-35 the Persian Government has budgeted for a sum of 50 million rials for road construction. Their receipts from the road tax are estimated at the same figure, z.e., 50 million rials. 479. Most of the money has been spent in the improvement of existing roads rather than on the construction of new routes. The more important of the roads newly constructed are :— (i) Shiraz-Tul-i-Khusrow. (ii) Kermanshah-Harsin-Khorremabad. (iii) Senneh-Merivan. (iv) Fariman-Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam. (v) Kerman-Firdaus (Tun). VII. —Military Affairs. (A) Army. (1) General. 480. The Shah continues to take a deep interest in the fighting forces and, virtually, to administer them. Matters of comparatively small importance are still submitted to him for disposal. Owing, perhaps, to the incompetence of his Ministers or, more likely, to the inevitable trend of a dictatorial Government, he is called upon to settle more and more of the routine business of the civilian departments, and hence finds less and less time to spend with his troops. 481. It is not thought, however, that his influence over the army or the army’s loyalty to his person have diminished thereby. During a year of economic depression and widespread poverty it is the army which has come off best, and every year some thousands of time-expired conscripts return to their homes and, seeing the destitution therein, are convinced and convince others that a roof, a bed, clothing and a full stomach easily compensate for the irksome restrictions of military discipline. 482. No improvement in the relations of the Persian army with foreign military attaches can be recorded. Social intercourse with Persian officers is still prohibited, and no invitations to foreign military attaches have been issued for such parades and manoeuvres as have taken place. 483. From brief, and usually distant glimpses of the army, their training seems to have improved, but there is a marked difference between the troops of the central garrison and those located in the provinces both in equipment and efficiency. 484. Great strides have been made in the re-equipment of the army during the past year, and their total purchases, chiefly in the form of aeroplanes, artillery, machine guns and mechanical transport, have not fallen far short of £2 million. 485. Little or nothing appears to have been done to improve supply, medical or veterinary services. 486. These shortcomings seriously hamper tactical dispositions and move ments. The Persian army can only move after a sufficiency of civilian motor transport has been commandeered, and its line of advance must perforce be restricted to areas in which food supplies are obtainable.58 Command. 487. The only change in the higher appointments has been the appointment of General Mohammad Khan Nakcnevan as Acting Minister of War in place of the late Sirdar Assad, and of General Azizullah Khan Zarghami, Comman dant of the Gendarmerie, as Acting Chief of the General Staff. (2) Expenditure. 488 v The budget allotment for the Ministry of War for the year 1933-34 was 203,/29,980 rials. This included the navy and air force votes for which no separate headings are given. This shows an increase of 20.010,000 rials over last year's figures and, when 29,205,000 rials for the gendarmerie, 5,500,000 rials for the frontier guards, and 350,000 rials for conscription expenses are added, the sum arrived at (238,784,980 rials or about £3,183,666 at the present rate of exchange) represents nearly 38-5 per cent, of the total budgeted expenditure of the country. 489. During the year an additional £2 million was voted by the Majlis for purchase of war material. This sum was found from the Persian Government’s holdings abroad. Strength. 490. The strength of the Persian armv has increased slightly since last year and is not far short of 80.000 men. Organisation. 491. Last year the General Staff planned a considerable reorganisation scheme, which entailed extensive regrouping of the independent formations in the centre, south and east of Persia. Owing, however, to their preoccupation with tribal risings, they have not been able to put this scheme into effect, and no note worthy changes have taken place since the submission of last year’s report. C onscription. 492. Conscription is working smoothly and extensively, though the Persian Government has not felt itself strong enough to attempt to impose it on the tribes as yet. The more settled state of the country has rendered its operation more extensive and effective, and the prospect of clothing, food and shelter has done much to popularise—or at any rate to render less hateful—^compulsory militarv service among the inhabitants. (3) Arms and Equipment. 493. These have been extensively purchased. In the main the light auto- matics are of Czechoslovakian manufacture. The artillery, comprising mountain medium guns and howitzers, have been bought chiefly from Sweden. The aircraft have been of British manufacture. America has supplied some heavy tractors tor artillery, and Germany some heavy lorries. (4) Training and Manoeuvres. Lt ..Twining has necessarily included a high proportion of elementary squad drill for the newly conscripted, but field work has not been neglected and training in fire and movement for formation up to a battalion has been'very regular Manoeuvres for the troops of the central garrison took place in November and lasted three days. The Eastern and Western Azerbaijan divisions took part in a combined exercise in October. No details or account of these manoeuvres were published by the General Staff or appeared in the press. (5) Arsenals. 495. Increased output of small arms ammunition is aimed at but owino- to delay m the installation of new machinery, has not been achieved. r59 (6) Personnel. 496. Major G. D. Pybus proceeded on 107 days’ leave on the 30th September and returned on the 14th January. ^ 497. Mr. A. C. Trott, the oriental secretary, officiated as military attach^ ysA'ing the period. 498. Major H. J. Underwood, officer language student, left Isfahan for India on the termination of his period of study duty on the 12th November. (7) Foreign Colleagues. 499. Captain Neshati Nasif Bey arrived on the 29th April to take up the appointment of Turkish military attach^. 500. Captain Nuri Bey, assistant military attache, has left and the appoint ment will not be filled. (B) A ir Force. 501. The year under review has seen a further increase in the number of machines in possession of the Persian air force. From an establishment of 54 machines in 1933, it has increased in size until in December the total establish ment was 68 machines. 502 Of the order placed with the Hawker Engineering Company in 1933 for 30 machines of the “Audax” and “Fury” types, 18 machines have been delivered to the Persian Government, leaving 12 machines still to be delivered to complete this order. Of this number, 8 have arrived at Ahwaz to be assembled and flown to Tehran. A further order for an additional 30 machines of the “Audax” and “Fury” types has been placed with the Hawker Engineering Company to be delivered during 1935. In addition, orders for a furthei 20 D.H. Tiger “Moth” machines with Gipsy Major 130 h.p. engine has been placed with the De Havilland Aircraft Company; 10 of these machines ha\e arrived at Ahwaz to be assembled and flown to Tehran. Thus, apart from further casualties, when all machines now on order have been delivered the number of machines in the possession of the Persian air force will be 148. 503. Colonel Alls Nordquist, Swede, air adviser to the Persian Government, tendered his resignation, which has been accepted. He left Tehran on the 18th April. It appears that one of the chief reasons for Colonel Nordquist’s resignation was that he insisted on direct access to His Imperial Majesty the Shah. This was refused. 504. Colonel Bever, a Belgian air force officer, succeeded Colonel Nordquist as air adviser to the Persian air force. He took up his duties on the 1st July. 505. Five Swedish air force officers were engaged by the Persian Govern ment as pilot instructors to the Persian air force. They arrived during January 1934 and resigned in July 1934. It is understood that the reason for their resignation was that while one of tneir colleagues (Second-Lieutenant J^kolais) was instructing a pupil the wheels of the machine struck the mound of a qanat while landing, causing considerable damage to the under-structure of the machine. Later Second-Lieutenant Skolais received notification that his services had been dispensed with. Representations were made to the Persian Government through the Swedish Charge d’Affaires protesting against Second-Lieutenant Skolais's dismissal, and pointing out that three months’ notice was required by contract under which these officers were engaged. Satisfaction was not forthcoming. The officers were dissatisfied over other incidents and at the geneial tieatment accoided them and, realising that they could not work under such conditions, tendered their resignation. 506. Six Belgian pilot instructors have been engaged by the Persian Govern ment to replace the Swedes. Four of this number have already taken up their duties and the remaining two are expected to arrive during January. 507. Five machines of the Hawker “Audax ” type, under the command of the General Office Commanding the Persian Air Force, left the capital for Angorao 60 via Tabriz and Diarbekr on the 24th October in order to be present at the celebra tions of the anniversary of Turkish independence. The outward and homeward journeys were completed without mishap. 508. Thirty-eight pupils (of which fourteen eventually qualified) underwent instruction as pilots at the flying school at Mehrabad and were posted to 1st Regiment of the air force. a/ - 509. The Persian air force took a prominent part in the manoeuvres carried out by the troops in the Tehran garrison during November, which lasted three days. No invitations to witness the operations were issued by the Persian Government to foreign military attaches. 510. The erection of a factory for the assembly of aircraft is being proceeded with at Tehran. It is estimated that the factory will turn out eight machines annually. 511. Of the establishment given above 5 D. H. Tiger “Moths”; 1 Hawker “Audax”; 1 Soviet “R.5” and 1 “Junker” are undergoing repairs and are not airworthy. 512. It will thus be seen that in the near future the Persian air force will be augmented by 8 Hawker machines and 10 D. H. Tiger “ Moths,” and later will be further so by the arrival of 34 Hawker and 10 He Havilland machines which complete outstanding orders. (C) Navy. 513. No new vessels have been acquired by the Persian navy during the year under review. 514. The vessels on order—all from Italy—are as follows :— (i) A 7,000-ton floating dock. (ii) A lighthouse tender of 1,100 tons. (iii) Three motor vedettes of about 65 feet length for service in the Caspian Sea. (iv) A tug and some lighters for service in the Persian Gulf. 515. The Persian sloops Babr and Palang paid a return visit to Indian waters in the spring. They called at Karachi, Bombay and Colombo. In Bombay they underwent an extensive overhaul in the Royal Indian Marine Dockyard. 516. The Majlis has voted 800,000 rials for the construction of a marine workshop, rest house and naval officer’s sporting club at Mohammerah. 517. Major Bayendor, Commandant of the Persian Navy, was promoted lieutenant-colonel in March 1934. 518. Commandant Campaynolli—Italian naval officer lent to the Persian navy—sent in his resignation in June and returned to Italy. 519. Unpleasant incidents in the Gulf, due to the truculence or ignorance of the Persian navy, have occurred, but on the whole 1934 has been a quieter year in this respect than 1933. The unauthorised visit on two occasions of a Persian sloop to the island of Tamb were probably the most noteworthy of these incidents. (D) Gendarmerie. 520. Colonel Ghulam Ali Khan Zand was appointed Commandant of the Gendarmerie in August 1934 in place of General Azizullah Khan Zarghami, appointed Acting Chief of the Central Staff. 521. During the past year the force continued to work unobtrusively and, on the whole, efficiently. o22. Some ten casualties were reported, most of which occurred in Kurdistan, where, as in other parts of Persia, gendarmerie posts of three men are frequently left to fend for themselves in areas where tribal risings calling for prompt military action have broken out.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT Printed for the use of the Foreign Office.

THE path of progress in what was previously Persia is a thorny one, and those who tread it would dearly love smoother and gentler going, perhaps even an occasional halt by the wayside. It is, indeed, permissible to ask whether progress itself is not contrary to nature in this picturesque country. But there is a driving force behind it all which never tires, and during the past year the path has been trodden towards the still distant goal with the same determination and the same disregard of all obstacles and possible complications. Work on the railway has been pressed on and trains are now running in the south between Bander Shahpour and Galeh Sheikh, a distance of 307 kilom., and in the north between Bander Shah and Pul-i-Sefid, 175 kilom. The Tehran terminus has been started at the huge cost of nearly £500,000, and will in due time take its place with a bourse, an opera house, a university, new Government offices and other municipal buildings in wide and solidly paved streets worthy of a 20th century capital. Electric light, water and a proper telephone system are under contemplation; the whole is to be crowned with a marble palace which the Shah is constructing for himself at huge cost. Nor has modernisation stopped short at these material activities. The number of schools for both sexes is steadily increasing, and athletic sport is being encouraged. The language is to be purified, and a society on the lines of the Academic frangaise has been formed to separate the Persian wheat from the Arab chaff; names have already been changed, Persia has become Iran, Mohammerah Khorramshahr. It has been the year of the abolition of the Pahlavi hat, and at its close the Shah’s female subjects were trembling behind their veils with joy or fear at the prospect of being forced to cast off these ancient coverings. 2. There is undeniably a directness of purpose about Reza Shah which cannot but command admiration. Whether his work survives or not, his place in history will be with men like Peter the Great, and there is much in his rugged character and simplicity of life which compels the analogy. His faults are faults without which he could not govern this country and his justification of them is the universal admission that no one understands Persia as he does. This in itself explains his determination to keep all sources of power in his hands, financial, military and political, his ruthlessness, the ready awakening of his suspicions, his injustices and often his brutality. These are vices inherent in the race and cannot be left out of the make-up of the Sovereign. But behind these unattractive qualities there is behind Reza Shah an ardent and driving patriotism which makes him hate the idea of his country’s backwardness and long passionately to urge it forward. He confessed to me on one occasion quite spontaneously that he could never go to Europe because he could not bear to see the contrast between Europe and his own country. 3. There has been the usual speculation upon the Shah’s health, that essential factor in the stability of the State. As far as is known, His Majesty has suffered from no illness during the year except on one occasion, when he was reluctant to receive the newly appointed Netherlands Minister. Otherwise, His Majesty has led his usual life, and the Afghan Ambassador, who saw him at the turn of the year, reported that he was in robust health. 4. But if progress has maintained its regular pace it has left behind it an increasing trail of social distress, while before it it is piling up an ominous barrier of financial difficulties. The ugly affair in the Shrine at Meshed, though largely[12998] b 3 have complaints of injustices done to commandeered lorry drivers, unnecessary difficulties caused to pilgrims, illegal arrests, detentions and expulsions, and, most important of all, the almost complete paralysis inflicted upon British consular officers by the refusal of practically all local officials, except the Governors, to have any dealings with them, whether official or private. 7. The fact is that, however willing the Ministry for Foreign Affairs may be, their word is not law with the other departments, nor is the word of those departments law in the Eastern provinces. There is room for endless abuse and misrepresentation, an advantage of which the authorities on the spot avail themselves to the full to cover up their misdoings and shield themselves from the Imperial wrath. In such circumstances it seems hardly reasonable to hope for improvement until the root cause of the evil has been removed. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs have more than once admitted that the real trouble is the absence of any adequately educated class from which to draw for their minor officials, most of whom are entirely ignorant—and ignorant, it may be added, with an ignorance which makes them fierce both in the execution of the duties and the misinterpretation of their instructions. Their zeal is the zeal of the murderers of St. Thomas of Canterbury. Once the wrong is done, the protest lodged and the report called for, these local officials have everything in their own hands. It is a simple matter to produce a report which throws the blame on the innocent victim of the accident. Skin-saving, even more than face-saving, is their trivial round, their common task. It is to be doubted whether better conditions can be hoped for until a more educated rank and file has grown up to fill these small administrative posts, and until more rapid means of communication exist in the remote parts of Eastern Iran. 8. These minor difficulties, where it has proved impossible to secure the satisfaction which is obviously due, continued as thorns in the side of His Majesty’s Legation throughout the past year. In wider issues it would be difficult to trace any consistent policy on the part of the Iranian Government, beyond that of getting all they can out of us. At the time of my arrival and for some months afterwards, allusions were made to the desire of the Iranian Government to clear up the various outstanding questions which had figured in the earlier treaty negotiations. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Prime Minister and the Shah himself mentioned this, and after M. Kazemi’s return from Geneva in March he announced his definite intention of opening negotiations. Then came the evacuation of Hen jam and Basidu. When I informed his Excellency of this step on the 2nd April, he at once took occasion to make some preliminary observations on the subject of general negotiations. It was then that he made his statement of the Iranian views regarding Bahrein and the Arab rulers, adding that, in return for so great a sacrifice, he expected to be met on two points, first, assistance in the Iranian claims on the Iraq frontier and, secondly, recognition of their pretensions to Tamb and Abu Musa Islands. After that date no further mention whatever was made to me during the rest of the year of general negotiations. For some weeks I was careful to miss no opportunity to emphasise the standpoint of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the islands, and after May, or June at the latest, no further allusion was made to those claims. It seems possible that the Iranian Government are awaiting the final result of the long-drawn-out negotiations on the Iraq frontier question in order to judge whether our assistance has been adequate to justify the confirmation of M. Kazemi’s admissions. 9. In point of fact certain piecemeal progress was made in the course of the year with questions which figured on the old draft treaty. The questions of Hen jam and Basidu (articles 4 and 5) have been disposed of; that of Bahrein (article 7) has been advanced by M. Kazemi’s declaration; the impending agreement regarding the cession of lights and buoys should settle article 9. The question of ships’ visits (article 3) seemed to be nearing a solution by the end of the year, while that of the wireless stations (article 6) had been considerably advanced by the decision to close the telegraph stations at Charbar and Hen jam and, in due course, that at Task. This slow and careful progress with individual questions would seem to be preferable to an attempt to revive the omnibus process, and in any case it appears preferable to leave all initiative to the Iranians. 9a. In her relations with other countries the chief preoccupation of Iran has been the frontier dispute with Iraq. This quarrel, which is entirely of Persian6 picking, dragged on indeterminately throughout the year, at Geneva, at Rome, at Tehran and at Bagdad, and by Christmas the only concrete contribution that had emerged was the Shah’s proposal to Nuri Pasha for an anchorage off Abadan. Both sides seemed to be to blame for vagueness, for not daring to come to the point and for tortuous procedure in general. It seemed, however, certain that the Shah definitely desired a settlement, though by the close of the year none was in sight. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, in the position of honest broker, allied to one side and friendly with the other, did what was possible to bring the parties closer together, but certain evident interests of their own in the Shatt may have created a suspicion that there was a British axe to grind. The suspicion is unjustified as such interests as His Majesty’s Government possess in the Shatt are likely to accord and not conflict with those of the riparian States and a happy association of all three countries in the control of these waters would be as much in the interests of Iran as of the other two parties. 10. Iranian feelings in the Italo-Abyssinian question have been definitely against the aggressor. This is quite intelligible as the accusations levied by Italy against Abyssinia were such as to strike home to the mind of the Iranian Government. Moreover, they had only recently had an example of Italian intrigue in the handling of the Iraq frontier question at Geneva. British prestige rose high and support of the League was universal in public opinion. Iran ranged herself readily on the side of the ‘ ‘ sanctionist ’ ’ countries. 11. A frontier settlement with Afghanistan based on the award of a Turkish arbitrator, and commercial agreements with the U.S.S.R., and Germany complete the tale of Iran’s major activities in the realm of foreign policy. The non-aggression pact between Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan cannot be included as a definite achievement of 1935. It had been initialled by the parties, but final signature had not taken place and seemed indeed dependent on a satisfactory solution of the Perso-Iraqi dispute. 12. One new departure was taken. The Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs visited India in November on his homeward journey from a stay as guest of the Afghan Government at Kabul. His Excellency spent three days as the guest of the Viceroy at New Delhi, and subsequently visited other parts of India, including certain of the Indian States. The visit was one of courtesy only, and no official matters were discussed. It is to be hoped, however, that it may have done much to remove certain misconceptions as to conditions in India which have in the past stood in the way of frank and friendly relations between the Government of India and the Iranian Government. II.— Foreign Relations. (A )—United Kingdom and India,. (1) General Treaty Negotiations. 13. On several occasions during the early months of the year His Majesty’s Minister discussed the general question of treaty negotiations with various members of the Iranian Government; but as it was not the policy of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to hurry matters, he always left it to the Iranians to take the initiative. At one moment in the spring it seemed that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was about to propose a definite, though limited, agreement on Gulf matters, but he then let the question drop and during the last seven months of the year treaty negotiations were never so much as mentioned. 14. Early in January the Prime Minister, in the course of a general conversation on Anglo-Iranian relations, expressed his conviction that with good will on both sides all points of disagreement could easily be settled, and he added that the Iranian Government hoped to resume negotiations when the Minister for Foreign Affairs returned from Geneva. A few days later the Shah touched on the question in a frank and friendly manner during the course of the audiencewhich he gave to His Majesty’s Minister and the Commander-in-chief. He expressed himself as being opposed to omnibus negotiations anti agreed with His Majesty’s Minister that it would be better to tackle the various questions one by one, embodying the result later if need be in a general treaty. 15. The Minister for Foreign Affairs was still absent when His Majesty s Minister left for the Gulf in February, but soon after the latter s return M. Kazemi informed him of his desire to begin negotiations, adding that he agreed to a piecemeal procedure. 16. M. Kazemi’s next reference to the question was at the beginning of April when His Majesty’s Minister called on him to inform him of the decision taken to evacuate the naval bases at Hen jam and Basidu. M. Kazemi then embarked on a general discussion of Gulf questions and made the suggestion that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom should (a) assist the Iranian Govrenment to obtain the recognition of Iran s rights in the Shatt-el-Arab, and (b) recognise Iranian sovereignty over Tamb, Abu Musa and Sirri. In return the Iranian Government would be ready to recognise (fi) the independence of Bahrein, and (b) the special treaty relations of His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom with the Arab sheikhs. 17. In reply, His Majesty’s Minister used the usual arguments over the islands and pointed out that it was impossible to reach a practical solution of the Shatt-el-Arab question until the juridical issue raised by Iran had been cleared out of the way. 18. M. Kazemi reverted to the matter again about a month later. On this occasion he laid much more emphasis on the Shatt-el-Arab than on the islands. As regards the latter he stated that Iran claimed only sovereignty over the islands and that he would see no objection to leaving the ownership of the land in the hands of the sheikhs. 19. M. Kazemi also raised the matter on similar lines with Mr. Eden at Geneva towards the end of May. -20 As the general situation in Europe made it impossible for His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to give immediate consideration to the above proposals, it was the policy of His Majesty’s Minister to maintain a general resistance to the Iranian claims and to endeavour to slow down negotiations. But as it happened, not much action was needed on his part, for M Kazemi never alluded to the matter again on his return from Geneva and the whole question remained in abeyance for the rest of the year. The possibility must not, however, be excluded that M. Kazemi was merely waiting until the Irano- Iraqi dispute had been finally settled. 21 In this connexion it is perhaps worth inviting special attention to the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, when protesting in the spring against the ^rant of the red oxide concession on Abu Musa (see Section II (A), 2 (m )), made a definite appeal to the status quo agreement in support of his arguments, thus showing that the Iranian Government were not only still prepared to recognise it, but were ready to cite it themselves. 22. Though not directly connected with the general treaty negotiations, it may be convenient to mention here the denunciation by Iian in the autumn of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty of the 10th May, 1928. No mention was made by the Iranian Government of the notes attached to the treaty, as piinted in Command Paper 3606/Persia, No. 1 (1930), and it did not seem to be clear whether the denunciation of that instrument affected them. Certain of them, notably No 7 relating to judicial safeguards, and No. 8 regarding British missionary work,’fall more naturally within the sphere of general, rather than of commercial, questions of interest to the two Governments. His Majesty’s Legation were awaiting instructions at the end of the year as to whether the question of the notes should be raised with the Iranian Government. (2) Persian Gulf. (a) General. 23 The outstanding event of the year in the Gulf was the transfer in April of the British naval bases at Hen jam and Basidu to Bahrein and Khor Kuwai. While this move was carried out primarily for reasons of administrative [12998] B 4convenience and represented a further stage in the policy of concentration of British interests on the Arab coast of the Gulf, the evacuation of Hen jam and Basidu also served to remove a number of points of friction with the Iranian Government. 24. This policy of withdrawal of British interests from the Iranian coast was carried still further in the autumn, when Cables and Wireless (Limited) effected a considerable programme of reorganisation. Their stations at Hen jam and Charbar were handed over to the Iranians, and it was decided that their station at Task should only be maintained until such time as the Iranian authorities had linked it up with their own internal system. 25. For the rest, the year was pleasantly free from incidents. No new cases occurred of Arab dhows being searched by Iranian warships, no serious correspondence took place with the Iranian Government in regard to any of the Arab sheikhdoms, and even Tamb and Abu Musa made only fleeting appearances in the limelight. 26. Such other questions as arose were all of a nature that could be discussed calmly and amicably at Tehran, the most important of these being the desire of the Iranian Government to take over the system of lighting and buoying on Iranian territory and in Iranian territorial waters, their regulations regarding the visits of foreign warships and their regulations concerning the flying of flags on ships in Iranian waters. Only in their attitude over ships’ visits did the Iranian Government seem to be behaving in an unfriendly manner, but even on this question there was still room for hope at the end of the year that they would finally accept the very conciliatory proposals suggested by His Majesty’s Govern ment in the United Kingdom. 27. The position of a number of British Indian subjects resident at Charbar, who also possessed Iranian nationality, formed the subject of voluminous correspondence and strong representations during the early part of the year; but the Ministry for Foreign Affairs proved to be unusually conciliatory and the question was well on its way to final settlement by the end of the year. 28. In general it is safe to say that during the year the Gulf lost its position as the main storm-centre in Anglo-Iranian relations. 29. His Majesty’s Minister carried out a tour in the Gulf in February and March in H.M.S. Shoreham, visiting Abadan, Koweit, Tamb, Basidu, Muscat, Henjam, Elphinstone Inlet, Khor Kuwai, Bahrein and Bushire. (b) Evacuation of Henjam and Basidu. 30 The desirability in principle of evacuating Henjam and Basidu as soon as was practicable had been admitted in the autumn of 1934, but a final decision was postponed pending the receipt of further information regarding the practicability of securing additional accommodation on the Arab coast by supplementing Bahrein with Khor Kuwai. This difficulty was disposed of by the receipt of a satisfactory report early in the year from the Commander-in-chief, Last Indies Squadron, and early in March the Admiralty gave their agreement to evacuation at the earliest possible date. a i 31 ' ^ rSt essent ^ a ^ was to reach a preliminary agreement with the Sultan of Muscat regarding Khor Kuwai, but this presented few difficulties and after the Sultan had been taken in H.M.S. Shoreham to inspect the place, he wi mgly ga\e his consent to its use by the navy subject to one or two unimportant reservations. r J h6 ne g otaat i° n ^is agreement was not, however, concluded until the 28th March, and meanwhile a number of other details had to be decided It was agreed that no hint should be given the Iranian Government in advance that Henjam and Basidu were being evacuated, as it was felt most desirable that they should have no opportunity to demand our withdrawal, and thus create the impression that we were being forced to leave instead of leaving of our own LGTu | herefore ^ was decided that no announcement of our intentions should be made on the Arab coast, and no steps should be taken to begin the actual evacuation until after our communication had actually been made to the Iranian Government. It was further decided that all buildings at Henjam and Basidu should be handed over to the Iranian Government, and that planks, doors and9 windows should not be removed, as had at first been suggested. Stores, furniture and heavy gear of various sorts would, however, be taken away, as also the flagstaff from Basidu. 33 A further problem arose over the future of those inhabitants of Basidu who had been especially useful to the Navy. It was felt that if they were left . , behind they might be ill-treated by the Iranian authorities after our departure, and it was therefore decided to give them an opportunity of leaving the place and settling on the Arab coast. A grant of £400 was made available for this purpose. It was originally decided that these persons should not be evacuated on board a sloop but that a dhow should be chartered; but for various reasons this plan had to be abandoned and thirty-one of the inhabitants were finally taken to Bahrein in a sloop. 34. These details having all been settled by the time it was learnt that the Sultan of Muscat had given his consent to the use of Khor Kuwai, His Majesty’s Minister was able to make the announcement of our evacuation to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 2nd April. His note stated that the transfer of the naval stations was being undertaken for reasons of administrative convenience, that all stores and portable property were being removed, but that His Majesty’s Government would hand over the buildings at Hen jam and Basidu to the local Iranian authorities, who would be free to make whatever use of them they wished. The note concluded with the request that the British cemeteries at Hen jam and Basidu would be respected, and that all necessary facilities would be accorded to any person whom His Majesty’s Minister might authorise to visit them from time to time to ensure their proper upkeep. Enclosed in the note was the text of a communique which was being issued on the Arab coast and which explained the if s reasons for the transfer of the naval stations to Bahrein. (Khor Kuwai was not mentioned.) 35 M. Kazemi received this announcement unexpectedly well and remarked * y that the decision of His Majesty’s Government represented a good step forward in eliminating points of disagreement with the Iranian Government. He added, however, that he would probably have to send a written reply in regard to certain statements in the communique, but that he must first consult the Council of Ministers. He then embarked on a long discussion of our general relations in the Gulf, of which mention has already been made in the section dealing with general treaty negotiations. 36. As soon as this interview had taken place, all posts concerned were informed and the communique, which was only issued officially on the Arab coast, was reproduced in London, Delhi, Bagdad, Jerusalem, Cairo and Aden. 37. The evacuation of Hen jam was completed on the 5th April. At Basidu the Mudir’s ferrash and the headman of Iranian Basidu came over and forbade any of the inhabitants to leave, threatening them with the confiscation of their property, but their action was later disavowed by the Mudir himself and the evacuation was completed on the 11th April without incident. All due ceremony was observed in hauling down the flag and transferring it to H.M.S. Shoreham. 38. M. Kazemi’s reply to His Majesty’s Minister’s note, which was received on the 8th April, stated that the Iranian Government “ viewed with pleasure ” the decision of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and gave an assurance regarding the maintenance of the British cemeteries at Hen jam and Basidu. The note concluded with the inevitable reservations about Iranian rights P over Bahrein and the relations between His Majesty’s Government in the United , Kingdom and the Arab sheikhs. The whole matter only received one incon spicuous reference in the Iranian press. 39. The evacuation automatically solved one or two outstanding questions e . in regard to Hen jam. During the course of 1934 the Iranian authorities had objected to the export of three old muzzle-loading guns that were used as moorings. As it was impossible to induce them to modify their attitude, it was decided at the time of the visit of the Commander-in-chief to Tehran in January to give up our intention of removing them, and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs were accordingly informed that they would be left where they were. At the moment of the evacuation they were therefore abandoned.10 40. The other outstanding question from 1934 was that of the numbering of the Royal Indian Marine launches used at Henjam. It was agreed that as a last resort they might be given the numbers R.I.N. 1, R.I.N. 2, &amp;c., but His Majesty’s'Minister made a final effort during the month of January to induce the Iranian authorities to abandon their demand. He pointed out to the Prime _ Minister that the regulations which had been cited were totally irrelevant to the present issue, and suggested that, as the Shah at the audience which he had accorded to the Commander-in-chief had laid stress on the desirability of co-operation between the British and Iranian navies, steps should he taken to prolong the present temporary suspension of the demand for numbering and registration. His Majesty’s Minister later made it clear to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs that he did not wish to press for any reply so long as the matter continued to remain in abeyance, and no reply was, in fact, ever received. The evacuation of Henjam, however, solved the question for good and all. (c) Naval Visits. 41. H.M.S. Hawkins, flying the flag of Vice-Admiral F. F. Rose, C.B., D.S.O., Commander -in-chief, East Indies Squadron, carried out a cruise in the Persian Gulf in January, visiting, amongst other ports, Henjam, Abadan and Bushire. 42. Vice-Admiral Rose was also able to pay a short visit to Tehran, arriving on the 9th January and leaving on the 11th January. He was received in audience with His Majesty’s Minister by the Shah on the 10th January. (Details of their conversation have been given in the section of this report devoted to General Treaty Negotiations.) 43. Captain V. S. Butler, D.S.O., who succeeded Captain J. V. Creagh, D.S.O., as Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, at the beginning of May, paid a visit to Tehran in August. (d) Iranian Naval Activity. 44. I he warships Babr and Palang again visited Bombay at the beginning of the year for a refit. 45. Endeavours were made during the course of the year to discover where the Iranian authorities proposed to install their floating dry dock which was on order in Italy. Early reports showed that a site wms being prepared in the River Karun below Mohammerah, but His Majesty’s vice-consul at Mohammerah reported in November that an expert engineer had visited the place in September and had advised the authorities that, in his opinion, no suitable site existed in the Karun. The best place would be in the Shatt-el-Arab, a short way below the mouth of the Karun, but Henjam was a possible alternative. The question was then referred to Tehran by Colonel Bayendor, who pointed out that the site in the Shatt-el-Arab would be in Iraqi waters. As far as is known, no definite decision in the matter has been reached by the end of the year. 46. In general, little was heard of the Iranian navy during the year under review. (e) Flag Incident at Bushire. 47. No satisfactory settlement was ever reached of the incident which occuned at Bushire late in 1934 when an Iranian naval officer caused the Red Ensign flown by the Mesopotamia Persia launch Garmsir to be lowered. 48 * * * * * 48. Repeated representations by His Majesty’s Minister brought no answer befoie his departure for the Gulf early in February, and it was only on the day be foie his return in March that any reply was received from the Ministry for Fqieign Afiabs. It was then explained by the head of the English Section that Lieutenant Darayazada had done no more than express his personal opinion that it was a pity that the launch did not fly the Iranian flag, seeing that it was the ordinary launch used for taking off passengers and mails in an Iranian port. M. Motamedy admitted, in reply to some pressure, that Lieutenant Darayazada had probably acted with more violence than he now admitted, since it was quite incredible that the crew of the Garmsir should have hauled down the flag in response to such a mild expression of opinion, but he stated that it was clear that11 I the officer had had no desire to provoke an incident or insult the British flag. He eventually added an expression of regret that the officer’s conduct should have led to an incident. 49. It being clear, however, that even this faint hint of an apology came from M. Motamedy alone and could not be regarded as official, His Majesty’s Minister returned to the charge with M. Kazemi and M. Soheily, but though the latter said that Lieutenant Darayazada had, in fact, been seriously taken to task and that for his own part he was quite prepared to convey to His Majesty’s Minister some expression of regret, he was unable to say anything officially without the approval of the Ministry of War. 50. The matter was subsequently taken up with the Iranian Minister in London, but with no greater success. It was therefore finally decided that, to close the incident, His Majesty’s Minister should address an official note to the Iranian Government reviewing the facts and stating that, while His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom did not propose to pursue the matter further, they felt obliged to place on record their disappointment at the manner in which their representations had been received. 51. A note on these lines was addressed to M. Soheily on the 1st November It remained unanswered. (f) Iranian Regulations regarding the Visits of Foreign Warships. 52. A reply was received in January to His Majesty’s Minister’s note of the 1st December, 1934, in which he stated that, in the view of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, in so far as the recently published Iranian regulations made the innocent passage of either belligerent or non-belligerent foreign warships through Iranian territorial waters conditional on prior notifi cation, they were contrary to established international law and practice. In their reply, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs argued that no provisions existed in international law with regard to the passage of foreign warships through coastal waters. Each State was thus free to consider its own needs. Nevertheless, in the interests of international intercourse, the Iranian Government did not ask for more than notification when not more than two ships were sailing together. 53. After interdepartmental discussion in London, it was decided that nothing would be gained by pursuing the matter further with the Iranian Govern ment, but that, as His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom continued to maintain their view of the right of innocent passage, His Majesty’s ships in the Persian Gulf would still follow their accustomed course near Farur Island and, if necessity arose, would pass through Iranian territorial waters without notifying the Iranian authorities. 54 55 * * * 54. An official of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs informed a member of the staff of His Majesty’s Legation in February that the Ministry of War wished to draw attention to the regulations regarding ships’ visits that had been issued in the autumn of 1934, and to request that in future notification of visits by ships of the Persian Gulf Squadron to Iranian ports should be made through the diplomatic channel. The Ministry of War wished to be in a position to issue the necessary instructions to the local authorities, and this they were unable to do at present as notification was made locally. It was pointed out to M. Motamedy that another article in the regulations provided exemption for ships that possessed “special permission,” and that His Majesty’s Legation had assumed that this article covered the Persian Gulf Squadron, in respect of which a special arrangement already existed. M. Motamedy at once agreed that such special arrangements were possible, but implied that the Iranian Government regarded the existing one as out of date, since it had been concluded before the promulga tion of the above regulations. It was finally agreed that His Majesty’s Minister, who was then in the Persian Gulf, should^ be informed of the above demarche, and that further consideration of the.question should be postponed until he had had an opportunity to discuss it with the British naval authorities there. 55. On the return of His Majesty’s Minister it was decided that it would be best to avoid possibly awkward discussions over the visits of His Majesty’s ships to Hen jam, and that nothing more should be said until after that base had been evacuated. It was therefore not until the middle of April that it became12 possible to pursue the matter further, when His Majesty’s Minister wrote privately to M. Kazemi and expressed the hope that the Iranian Government would agree to the continuance of the existing system. In that event he would be happy to make application for special permission in accordance with article 3 of the regulations. 56. Nothing further was heard until the end of May, when M. Motamedy reverted to the matter and outlined what may be regarded as a typically Iranian standpoint. The Iranian Government would gladly agree to the continuance of the existing system if reciprocity could be granted. Unless they had this they would find it difficult to refuse similar requests for special permission from other Governments, and especially from the Soviet. The only reciprocity desired by the Iranian Government, however, was for visits by Iranian warships to ports on the Arab coast of the Gulf, and this they could not officially ask for since they did not recognise the special treaty relations of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom with the Arab sheikhs. In reply it was suggested that if the Iranian Government merely wanted some arrangements that would safeguard their position with the Soviet Government, it might be possible to arrange for reciprocity for Iranian ships in Indian ports. 57. This suggestion was not, however, accepted by the Ministry of War, who stated, according to M. Motamedy, that reciprocity in Indian ports would be of no practical value to them, and that they could only agree to give the Persian Gulf Squadron special permission if and when it became possible to arrange for reciprocity for Iranian ships to visit Arab ports in the Gulf. 58. When M. Kazemi finally replied to His Majesty’s Minister’s letter at the end of July, he made no mention of the above arguments, though his letter referred to the conversations on the subject which had taken place. He merely stated that, for the reasons already explained, the Iranian Government had difficulty for the time being in accepting His Majesty’s Minister’s proposal, but that they would readily continue to grant all assistance and facilities in accordance with the regulations. He finally asked that instructions should be issued that these regulations should be observed from then on. 59. To this His Majesty’s Minister replied that he was unable to cause fresh instructions to be issued until the matter had been considered by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, and that he trusted that meanwhile the Iranian Government would agree to the continuance of the existing system. 60. The question was subsequently discussed with the senior naval officer when he visited Tehran in August, and, after further reference to the Foreign Office, His Majesty’s Minister was authorised to propose the following arrangement:— (1) Visits would henceforth be notified through the diplomatic channel, but for the sake of convenience the local authorities would simultaneously be informed direct. It would be understood that the latter, in the absence of any communication from the Iranian Government, would then raise no objection to the visit. The Iranian Government on their part would issue general instructions to this effect to their local authorities in the Gulf. (2) Local notification only would, however, be made when one of His Majesty’s ships proposed to visit Abadan for the sole purpose of fuelling. It would be understood that visits thus notified would not constitute official visits involving exchanges of calls and that no officer or member of the ship’s company would be landed. 61 * * * * * * 61. The Iranian reply, when it reached His Majesty’s Legation in December, proved most unsatisfactory, since it insisted as to (1) that the local authorities must await confirmation from the Imperial Government before they could take official cognisance of our notification, and refused the suggestion in (2), using the false argument that several days’ notice had to be given to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and that His Majesty’s ships coufd therefore without inconvenience follow the same procedure as for visits to other ports.13 62. His Majesty’s Minister returned to the charge shortly before the end of the year, and urged strongly that the Iranian Government should reconsider the matter and accept his proposals. 63. Correspondence also took place with the Iranian Government during the course of the year over the scale of naval salutes laid down in the above- mentioned regulations. These provided that an officer of the rank of ‘ ‘ sarhang (which is generally taken as the equivalent of c&lt; colonel ”) should receive a salute of eleven guns, whereas it was international practice to accord this salute only to an officer of the rank of commodore, which is equivalent to the rank of brigadier- general and in the French navy to an officer of the rank of Capitaine de Vaisseau, Chef de Division. This -fact was brought to the notice of the Iranian Govern ment in a note dated the 15th February, and it was suggested that they would doubtless wish to adhere to the existing international scale. 64. The reply of the Iranian Government was to the effect that the rank of commodore did not exist in the Iranian navy, and that a 1 ‘ naval colonel commanding a division ” should be regarded as being of the same rank as a “Capitaine de Vaisseau, Chef de Division” in the French navy. It was therefore proper that a salute of eleven guns should be accorded to him. 65. The matter was not pursued further with the Iranian Government. (g) Regulations regarding the Flying of Flags on Ships. 66. It was learnt at the beginning of July that the Ministry of War had issued certain regulations in regard to the flying of flags on ships in Iranian waters. Their wording was somewhat obscure, but enquiry at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs elicited the following interpretation : Articles 1 and 2 provided that Iranian-owned craft should not ordinarily fly the national flag, but might do so on national holidays. Article 3 laid down that foreign vessels when calling at Iranian ports might continue to wear their national flag, but that foreign-owned craft which plied for hire exclusively in Iranian waters must obtain a licence to operate and must not fly their national flag. Article 4 exempted boats belonging to foreign diplomats from the scope of the regulations. Probably as a result of the enquiries made by His Majesty’s Legation, supplementary regulations were issued in September which made it clear that article 3 did not apply to foreign- owned vessels which plied between Iranian and foreign ports on condition that they did not remain for more than four months per annum in Iranian waters and that they did not transport cargo in the internal waters of Iran. 67. Enquiries showed that launches, &amp;c., belonging to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company did not fly the British flag when navigating in the Karun, though they did so in the Shatt-el-Arab, and that the vessels belonging to the Mesopotamia Iran Corporation which plied up the river as far as Ahwaz had not worn the red ensign for years. The only British vessels to be affected therefore seemed to be the now notorious launch Garmsir at Bushire. 68 * * * * * * * * 68. As there was no time for the regulations to be studied by the competent departments of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom before their entry into force, His Majesty’s Minister recommended that the Garmsir should, for the time being, wear no flag. At the same time he urged the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that she should be exempted from the regulations on the ground that she did not ply for public hire but operated privately in the interests of her owners and certain other steamship companies, that she operated as a link in the service of international traffic and performed no purely local work, and that she was a sea-going vessel which proceeded occasionally to ports outside Iran. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs replied, however, that the Garmsir could not be exempted from the regulations unless she plied regularly to ports outside Iran. Shortly afterwards, instructions were received from the Foreign Office to the effect that the Iranian regulations, though possibly unusual, were not contrary to any provisions of international law and that the Garmsir would not contravene any British law by conforming to them. The matter was, therefore, allowed to drop.14 (h) Territorial Waters. 69. Acting under instructions, His Majesty’s Minister addressed a note to the Iranian Government on the 16th February stating, with reference to the Iranian law on territorial waters of the 15th July, 1934, that it w T as the view of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and of the Arab sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf that where a group of islands existed, each island possessed its own belt of territorial waters and that a single belt could not be claimed, as in the Iranian law, for the whole group. 70. In their reply, the Iranian Government maintained that this question was not covered by the provisions of international law, and that any State was, therefore, free to lay down such regulations as its needs might require. They further argued that the draft project drawn up at The Hague Conference of 1930 for the Codification of International Law fully supported their attitude. The note also made the usual reservations about the right of His Majesty’s Legation to make communications to the Iranian Government on behalf of the Arab sheikhs. 71. The matter was not pursued further. (i) Arms Traffic. 72. Careful investigation was made into the report which reached His Majesty’s Legation in the autumn of 1934 that a large consignment of rifles had been run between Jask and Charbar for the Khan of Remishk. Enquiry seemed to show, however, that no gun-running was taking place on a large scale, and that such small volume of traffic as existed was being carried on by Iranian Baluchis who had emigrated to the Trucial Coast and the Batineh coast of Muscat. 73. Nevertheless, further reports were received during the course of the summer that a large number of Belgian rifles were being smuggled across from Debai, and that not less than 5,000 had been landed during the past twelve months. It proved impossible, however, to obtain more than fragmentary information on the subject. 74. No serious discussions took place with the Iranian Government in regard to an Arms Traffic Convention during the course of the year, though the Prime Minister mentioned in conversation early in the year that this was one of the questions to which the Iranian Government would attach importance. 75. In March the Foreign Affairs Committee of the United States Senate voted against the inclusion of the so-called King reservation in the ratification by the United States of the Arms Traffic Convention. The Senate later upheld the attitude of the Committee and approved ratification of the Convention without the above reservation. (j) Lighting and Buoying. 76. After considerable interdepartmental discussion in London instructions were despatched to His Majesty’s Minister at the end of February as to the reply to be returned to the request of the Iranian Government, that lights and buoys situated on Iranian territory and in Iranian waters should now be handed over to them (see paragraph 107 of the annual report for 1934). 77 77. It was decided that the Iranian Government should be informed that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom willingly agreed to their proposals that they should assume responsibility for lighting and buoying within their own territory and territorial waters in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman. Nevertheless, it was felt that, as the lights in question had hitherto been managed as part of a unified system in common with other lights throughout the two Gulfs, careful preliminary consultation would be necessary between Colonel Ward, head of the Persian Gulf Lighting Service of the Government of India, and the new Iranian lighting authorities. It was, therefore, suggested that permission should be obtained from the Iraqi Government for Colonel Ward to come to Tehran to assist His Majesty’s Minister in the necessary conversations. Pending these discussions the Iranian Government should be asked to ensure that their maritime authorities took no steps to secure control of the lights and buoys in question.15 78. A note on these lines was addressed to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the 21st March, and as the Iranian Government at once accepted the suggestion that Colonel Ward should come to Tehran, and themselves agreed to summon Lieutenant-Colonel Bayendor, it became possible to hold detailed discussions by the middle of April. 79. Briefly, it was the object of His Majesty’s Minister and Colonel Ward :— (a) To negotiate a comprehensive business settlement for the transfer at a fair price of the lights and buoys belonging to the Government of India, and (b) To obtain, if possible, some form of undertaking that the Iranian Government would levy dues for the maintenance of their new system on a reasonable scale. 80. Meetings were held with the Iranian representatives on the 16th April and the 20th April, and all went smoothly. The list of lights and buoys which the Government of India were prepared to hand over was communicated to Colonel Bayendor and though he drew attention to the omission of both the Tamb lighthouse and the lights in the Hooka Channel from the list, no awkward discussions arose as he at once withdrew over Tamb, when His Majesty’s Minister explained that it could not come within the scope of the present discussions, and over the Rooka Channel, when it was pointed out to him that the lights there were the property, not of the Government of India, but of the Iraqi Government. 81. Colonel Ward and Colonel Bayendor also met privately one afternoon and discussed some of the technical questions involved. The latter then made it clear that the Iranian Government intended eventually to establish a number of fresh lights, e.g., on Farur Island and off Ras-ul-Mutaf. 82. Agreement was finally reached on the following lines :— (1) The Iranian Government agreed to purchase all the lights, &amp;c., at the prices named, with the exception of the Qais Island Lightship; (2) The Iranian Government desired to rent the lightship until such time as they had erected on shore a lighthouse to replace it, a proposal which His Majesty’s Minister accepted subject to reference to the Government of India; (3) The question of the lights on the buildings belonging to Cable and Wireless (Limited) at Hen jam and Charbar was to be held over until His Majesty’s Minister received instructions as to their value; (4) His Majesty’s Minister agreed that His Majesty’s consulate-general at Bushire would continue to maintain the lights situated within the property of the consulate-general until such time as the Iranian authorities had installed other lights; (5) Colonel Ward agreed to supply any necessary spares at cost price; (6) Colonel Bayendor asked that, as from the date when the Iranian Govern ment purchased the lights, &amp;c., Colonel Ward should maintain them on their behalf until such time as the Iranian authorities were in a position to take over the service themselves. During this period the Iranian Government would refund to Colonel Ward all costs incurred by him on their behalf. (7) The Iranian delegates stated that the Ministry of Finance had given a formal assurance that dues would not be levied at a rate greater than was necessary to cover the costs of operation and the amortisation of the capital invested. 83. A draft provisional agreement on these lines was later drawn up in His Majesty’s Legation and accepted by the Iranian delegates, subject to final reference to the Ministry of War. His Majesty’s Minister also made it clear on his side that the approval of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India would equally be necessary. 84. The general conclusion to be drawn from these meetings was that Colonel Bayendor himself was by no means keen to take over the lighting service, but that for reasons of prestige the Iranian Government were now determined to assume responsibility for it themselves. Colonel Bavendor showed himself to be most eager to co-operate closely with Colonel Ward during the transitional period, and the negotiations in general were conducted in the most friendly spirit.16 85. The terms of the provisional agreement having been studied by the competent Departments of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India, His Majesty’s Minister was able early in August to inform the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he had been authorised to conhrm the general principles of the agreement, subject to two reservations :— (1) It had not yet proved possible for His Majesty’s Government in the^^ United Kingdom to send final instructions regarding the Henjam and Charbar lights, as it had been necessary to consult Cables and Wireless (Limited), whose property they were. It was suggested that this question should be disposed of separately at a later date. (The real reason for the delay on this point was that no instructions could be issued until a final decision had been taken on the company’s programme of reorganisation); and (2) The Government of India’s readiness to rent the Qais Island light-vessel was dependent on the condition that any losses or damages sustained by the crew or vessel should form a charge against the Iranian Government and was, further, without prejudice to the use of the lightship in a chain of independent route lights outside Iranian waters after the conclusion of the transitional period. 86. It was now learnt that Colonel Ward would shortly be arriving in Tehran again in connexion with the Irano-Iraqi negotiations over the Shatt-el- Arab, and when the Ministry for Foreign Affairs were informed, they at once agreed to summon Colonel Bayendor for a further meeting. This meeting took place on the 20th August after an oral assurance had been received from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the Iranian Government were ready to agree to the provisional agreement as modified, subject to further discussion with regard to their responsibility for any losses or damages incurred by the lightship or its crew. 87. No difficulties arose over this point, however, as Colonel Ward was able to give an assurance that the risk could be covered by insurance and that the premium would not be a heavy one. 88. The question of the Henjam and Charbar lights was then unexpectedly disposed of by Colonel Bayendor saying that he took no interest in them whatsoever and that it would cause him no concern if they were to be extinguished at once. He did not think they were worth discussing further. 89. In reply to an enquiry from M. Motamedy, the meaning of the Govern ment of India’s second reservation over the Qais Island lightship was explained at some length. The Iranian delegates accepted it without question, but discussion of the point prompted Colonel Bayendor to say that it had occurred to him that it might eventually be worth the while of his Government to purchase the lightship and move it elsewhere, possibly to Stiffe Bank. As this move seemed likely to form part of our own eventual policy, Colonel Ward endeavoured to dissuade Colonel Bayendor from such thoughts, but without success. 90. It was also suggsted to Colonel Bayendor that, when he came to take over the running of the system, he should keep in close touch with a committee of interested shipowners. This idea did not seem to appeal to him, however, and he hastened to suggest that their views should be represented not to himself, but to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Whether he was later moved by Colonel Ward’s eloquence on the virtues of co-operation, it is hard to say. 91. A few days later a draft protocol in French was received from M. Motamedy and forwarded to the Foreign Office and to the Government of India. It included a clause which would enable the Iranian Government to purchase and move the Qais Island lightship at a later date, but contained nothing on the subject of dues. 92. The protocol was subsequently redrafted in the Foreign Office and communicated to the other Government Departments concerned. Most of the changes involved points of drafting only, but others (notably the eventual sale of the lightship and the question whether a clause about dues should or should not be included in the protocol) required decision on matters of principle. Inter departmental discussions were still proceeding at the end of the year.93. During the course of the summer (after the first discussions with the Iranian Government) the press published calls for tenders for lighthouses at Bushire and on Qais Island. It was evident that the Bushire light was intended to guide aircraft as well as shipping, and Colonel Ward took advantage of his meeting with Colonel Bayendor in August to express his personal view that the light proposed would be of very doubtful utility and that Colonel Bayendor would do well to re-examine his specifications. Later it was ascertained that the Iranians seemed to be following this advice. 94. When Cable and Wireless (Limited) closed their station at Hen jam shortly before the end of the year, it was suggested to the Iranian Government that they should instruct an Iranian petty officer stationed there to attend to it in future. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs had not replied by the end of the year. (k) Bahrein. 95. Very little was heard about Bahrein during the year. The communique issued at the moment of the evacuation of Hen jam and Basidu contained a reference to the fact that the naval stations in the Gulf were being moved there, and M. Kazemi’s reply to His Majesty’s Minister’s note regarding the evacuation accordingly contained a reservation in regard to c ‘ the right of the Imperial Government in connexion with Bahrein both for the present and for the future. M. Kazemi qualified his reservation, however, by stating, that he did not wish at this juncture to embark upon a discussion of the question. 96. At the same time, M. Kazemi, in conversation with His Majesty’s Minister, expressed the view that the Iranian Government were quite prepared to recognise the independence of Bahrein, which, he indicated, was really of no interest to Iran. But in face of Iranian public opinion, the Government could not abandon their claim without something to show in return. (The substance of this conversation has been more fully recorded in the section dealing with General Treaty Negotiations.) 97. Bahrein did not subsequently form the subject of any correspondence with the Iranian Government. (l) Correspondence with the Iranian Government regarding the A rab Sheikhdoms. 98. While the Iranian Government refuse to send any official reply to communications from His Majesty’s Legation in regard to matters affecting the Arab sheikhdoms, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs are willing to give oral replies to requests for information on such questions as, for instance, the detention of Arab dhows in connexion with smuggling charges. 99. During the course of the year M. Motamedy twice asked His Majesty’s Legation to obtain information in regard to cases in Koweit in which the interests of Iranian subjects were involved. After some correspondence, His Majesty s Minister and the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf eventually decided that we should forward any such complaints to the Govern ment concerned for whatever reply they might return. 100. It was felt that even such oral requests for information constituted a slight admission of the special position held by His Majesty’s Government with the Arab sheikhs, and that refusal on our part to forward them would probably only lead to a stalemate, in which neither side would agree to investigate the other’s complaints. (m) Tamb and A bu Musa. 101. Some mysterious happenings took place at Tamb in the early part of the vear following on the action of the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah at the end o 1934 in having his flagstaff removed (see paragraph 140 of the annual report for 1934). There being grounds for suspicion that the sheikh had been mtiigumg with the Iranians, the senior naval officer landed a small guard and, though t us was later withdrawn, for some weeks a sloop visited the island at liequent intervals. [12998] c18 / 102. Enquiries seemed to show, however, that it was uniikely that the sheikh had offered the island to Iran, and that it was more probable that his object was to force His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to purchase it from him, or at any rate pay rent for it. 103. While the above matter was still under consideration by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, a report was received that a native of Tamb^N* had been approached by the Mudir of Iranian Basidu, and later by the Sheikh of Qishm, to take to Tamb a letter from Tehran. This he refused to do. He also said that the Mudir of Customs at Bander Abbas would arrive at Tamb at the beginning of February to collect customs duties and probably hoist the Iranian flag. 104. While these later events tended to lend colour to the original suspicion that some intrigue might be afoot between the sheikh and the Iranians, it nevertheless seemed hard to believe that the Iranian Government were designedly planning a couf at Tamb, though it appeared by no means unlikely that local Iranian officials in the Gulf were acting on their own initiative and were trying to take advantage of the opportunity offered by the removal of the sheikh’s flag. 105. Meanwhile, the Sheikh of Sharjah was showing himself only too ready to hoist his own flag on the island and, though doubts were felt as to the advisability of our facilitating a change of ownership at the present juncture, it was eventually decided to inform the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah that he would be required to rehoist his flag and replace a guard on the island within ten days, failing which the Sheikh of Sharjah would be allowed to hoist his flag. 106. Faced with this ultimatum, the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah replaced his flag at the beginning of April. 107. The final series of events took place in the middle of April. On the 13th April a dhow came to Tamb from Lingeh and landed an Iranian who was believed to have been in the Iranian Customs Service. He inspected the flagstaff and expressed surprise that the sheikh’s flag had now been replaced. Apparently he expected to find the British flag flying. He left again in the evening. 108. Two days later another dhow arrived, bringing Sheikh Abdullah from Iranian Basidu, who had with him a letter which he gave to Mahmoud, the headman of the village, and for which he endeavoured to obtain a receipt. Early next morning H.M.S. Lupin, having obtained advance news of this visit, arrived at the island, and the commanding officer interviewed both Abdullah and Mahmoud. Abdullah was then told that he could go, which he did that afternoon without having obtained his receipt. The letter, when opened, proved to contain copies of a decree in regard to elections to the Majlis. They were signed by an official from Bander Abbas. 109. It was decided, after consideration in London, that this matter should not be taken up with the Iranian Government, partly because there was no evidence to show that they, as opposed to their provincial officials, had been responsible for the despatch of these notices to Tamb, and partly because the means by which we obtained possession of them were not such as to facilitate a protest. U0. Concurrently, a different series of events brought Abu Musa into the hmelight. in 1934 a British company had obtained a concession from the Sheikh ot Sharjah to exploit the red oxide deposits on the island. Early in 1935 an official of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs stated, in conversation with the oriental secretary, that the Iranian Government desired that no steps should be taken, and that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would permit nothing to be done which would affect the proprietory interests in the island claimed by the Iranian Government. Nothing more was heard for two months, but on the 19th March the same official stated that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had instructed him to convey a formal protest against the grant of the above concession on the ground that it was a violation of the status quo. On the instructions of His Majesty s Minister an oral reply was returned the following da} that he could not agree that the grant of the concession was in any way a breach of the status quo, since the sheikh was merely exercising rights which he had long held. ° G[12998] c 2 111. The effect of this reply was to produce, a week later, an official note of protest, reserving the rights of the Iranian Government in respect of any profits or losses arising out of the concession, and requesting His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to prevent further operations, failing which they would take the necessary action to preserve their rights. 112. To this note His Majesty’s Minister was instructed to reply that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom could not accept the Iranian protest nor agree that Iran had any grounds for complaint. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were not prepared to modify their refusal to recognise Iranian claims to the island, and they felt equally unable to agree that any question arose of the infringement of the status quo. 113. The views of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were also explained at length to the Iranian Minister in London, when the question was raised by him under instructions from Tehran. 114. At the end of April a further note of protest was received by His Majesty’s Minister. It was of considerable length and its argumentation was hard to follow. No reply was returned to it, except for a simple acknowledgement stating that a copy was being forwarded to the Foreign Office. 115. Both Tamb and Abu Musa were mentioned in a number of conversations which His Majesty’s Minister had with various Iranian Ministers on the subject of Gulf questions'in general. These conversations have been dealt with in the section on General Treaty Negotiations. (n) Charbar. 116. As a result of frequent and vigorous representations, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs agreed in writing on the 21st January to the following solution of the problem of the nationality of certain Khojas, Katris and Baluchis resident at Charbar. Those of them who could show that their fathers had possessed British nationality, and who wished themselves to retain it, would be allowed to submit fresh petitions for the renunciation of their Iranian nationality under article 13 of the Nationality Law. Such petitions must be handed in to the Governor before the 21st March, and the petitioners would have to agree to leave Iran within a time-limit to be determined later. At the same time, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Minister that instructions had been sent to the local authorities to allow Major Lincoln to see the individuals concerned and to assist them in drawing up their petitions. It was also an understood thing that the Iranian Government would accept all bona fide petitions, and Major Lincoln was accordingly instructed to use every care in seeing that all the petitioners had indisputable claims to British nationality. 117. There then followed a period of some weeks, aggravating for all concerned but especially trying for Major Lincoln, during which nothing could succeed in making the local authorities act on their instructions. Giving a masterly display of all the arts of prevarication, they succeeded triumphantly in making it impossible for Major Lincoln to achieve anything, and for a long time it seemed that not even the most categorical instructions from Tehran would suffice to move them. The Governor, perhaps, took rather a coward’s course in departing at the critical juncture for the interior, where he was out of range of all telegraphic communications, but his deputy proved to be a more spirited adversary and effectively checkmated the Chief of Police when the latter showed some signs of weakening after about a month. Even when explicit orders were sent to him not to interfere with the Chief of Police, he succeeded in ignoring them on the ground that they were addressed to him in his capacity as commander of the local garrison and not in that of Acting Governor ! To cut the story short, his resistance remained unbroken to the end, and it was only when the Governor returned in the second week in March that Major Lincoln was at last allowed to see the individuals concerned (of whom there were twenty-seven) and help them with their petitions. He was eventually able to leave on the 19th March after a stay of three and a half months at Charbar.118. In July His Majesty’s Legation were informed that the petitions had been accepted by the Council of Ministers, but further enquiry showed that (a) the petition of Haji Abdul Hussein, the leader of the Khoja community in Charbar and the principal merchant in Charbar, had not been granted; (b) the remaining petitions had only been accepted in respect of the men themselves and their wives and families remained Iranian subjects; and (c) eight of the petitioners were expected to perform their military service before they would be allowed to leave the country. 119. Representations were made to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on all three points with the result that satisfaction was obtained on (b) and (c ); but nothing definite had been heard by the end of the year in regard to the petition of Haji Abdul Hussein. 120. Major Lincoln also discovered, when at Charbar, that ten natives of British Baluchistan, who could in no way be claimed as Iranian nationals, had had their passports seized by the police and that some of them had even been forced to take sij ills. The matter was referred to the Iranian Government early in April, but, despite numerous reminders, it proved impossible to extract a reply before the end of the year. (o) Cable and Wireless (Limited). 121. At the time of the removal of the naval depot from Henjam, Cable and Wireless (Limited) were informed that it was no longer essential that they should maintain the cable station there. They replied that they had in fact already prepared for submission to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom a comprehensive scheme of reorganisation in the Persian Gulf, under which their stations at Henjam, Jask and Charbar would be closed. The main reason for this proposal was economy, though the company were doubtless influenced by the difficulties which they experienced in maintaining their stations in the face of Iranian import restrictions, &amp;c. 122. Consideration of the various questions raised by this proposal pro ceeded in London during the course of the summer and at the end of August His Majesty’s Minister was informed that the company’s plans had been approved and could be put into operation at short notice. Final instructions were received a month later and on the 27th September His Majesty’s Minister addressed a note to the Iranian Government stating that the company had decided to close the three above-mentioned stations. The existing cable communication between Iran and India would not, however, be affected as the station at Bushire would still be maintained. It was proposed that the work of reorganisation should be begun in approximately a week’s time. 123. Friendly but firm representations were then, however, received from the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs that the closure of these stations at such short notice would involve the complete telegraphic isolation of Jask, Charbar and South-East Iran generally, since there was no land-line from Bander Abbas to Jask. He stated that his Department were only too ready to assist the company and that they would raise no objection to the closure of the stations at Henjam and Charbar; but it was of vital importance that the station at Jask should be maintained until it could be connected up by land-line with Bander Abbas. 124. In deference to these representations and because also the French and Dutch air lines agreed to pay for the maintenance of the station so long as they continued to use the Iranian route, the company agreed to remain at Jask for a further period not exceeding two years, provided that no objection was raised to the rest of their programme. 125. The Iranian Government’s acceptance of the proposal was, however, qualified by a reservation that, if the land-line to Jask were not completed within two years, they would expect the company to remain there until such time as it was finished. This condition the company were not prepared to accept, but they agreed that, if the Iranian Government met with unforeseen difficulties, they would be ready, when the time came, to discuss the question of their remaining at Jask for a further period.21 [12998] c 3 126. The company’s reorganisation accordingly proceeded on this basis. The stations at Hen jam and Charbar were closed forthwith and the land-hne between Jask and Gwatar was handed over to the Iranian authorities. J he company’s cable ship at the same time carried out free repairs to tlm cable between Bander Abbas and Henjam, which is the property of the Iranian Government, in return for a promise by the latter to settle a long-overdue account for repairs carried out to the same cable in 1932. 127. The question of duties payable on the company’s importations con tinued to form the subject of discussions during the year. The attitude adopted by the Iranian Government proved to be not altogether unreasonable and they even agreed to a refund of certain taxes claimed by the company; but they had not disclosed by the end of the year exactly what categories of stores they were prepared to admit duty free. 128. At the time of the evacuation of Henjam the Ministry for Foreign Affairs stated that they understood that the wireless installation there was being removed, and they enquired whether His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would be prepared to sell them the wireless plants at Henjam, Lingeh and Bushire. No reply could be returned to this enquiry until after a decision had been taken in regard to the cable reorganisation, but His Majesty’s Minister was then instructed that, while the sets at Henjam and Lingeh were the property of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of of India, the plant at Bushire belonged to the company, who were anxious not to see it pass into Iranian hands. As the sets at Henjam and Lingeh were in any case considered to be valueless and as the Iranians seemed by then to have forgotten their earlier request, it was decided not to revert to the matter for feai of causing an awkward situation, should the Government press their request in regard to the station at Bushire. 129. A commission met at Jask at the very end of 1934 to discuss with the company’s local manager the question of the area to be occupied by the company s station (see paragraphs 198 and 199 of the annual report for 1934). A new boundary line was decided on, but the commission did not agree with the manager s request that a proper fence should be erected along the new boundary line in order to safeguard the water supply from encroachment and pollution. The commission also argued that one of the bungalows claimed by the company was unnecessary for the requirements of the station. It is not known what was the final outcome of these discussions. (3) East Iran. (a) General. 130. In previous years matters affecting the Gulf had played a preponderant part in all discussions with the Iranian Government. During the year under review it was the situation in East Iran that caused His Majesty s Legation the greatest concern. 131. The prime cause of the trouble lay in the fact that all power in East Iran was in the hands of the military authorities, with whom His Majesty s consular officers were not allowed to communicate. Protests addressed to local Governors proved quite unavailing, and there was consequently no way of checking the high-handed manner in which the military treated British Indian subjects. A further cause of difficulty was the fact that the militaiy, having pioved singularly unsuccessful both in their dealings with Baluchi tribesmen and in their handling of the Meshed riots, endeavoured to divert blame from themselves by spreading reports of British machinations. 132. Individual questions, such as the requisitioning of Indian lorry drivers, the expulsion of British subjects, and the attitude of the customs and other authorities towards pilgrims, are dealt with in later sections of this report. Here it is only necessary to say that the harsh manner in which Indians were treated caused His Majesty’s Legation grave concern and that the unsatisfactory situation represented by this state of affairs was seriously aggravated by the impossible position in which His Majesty’s consular officers were now placed. 133. The situation was frequently represented to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs throughout the year and the opportunity of Colonel Daly’s two visits to22 lehran was taken to arrange informal meetings between him and M. Soheily, at which matters were very frankly discussed. It was also decided that the question should be raised with M. Kazeini in Delhi. This proved impossible, however, as his Excellency stated on arrival that he wished his visit to be treated purely as one of courtesy and that he did not desire to discuss any questions affecting Indo-Irano relations. It was, nevertheless, found possible for his Excellency the Viceroy to indicate to him in a private conversation the disquiet with which the Government of India viewed the existing situation, and for the Deputy Foreign Secretary to raise the matter in more explicit terms with M. Motamedy. 134. Just prior to M. Kazemi’s arrival in Delhi a deplorable impression was created by a number of arrests in the Meshed area. The first sufferer was the headman of a village where Mr. Mallet and Mr. Reilly had recently camped (in company with an escort of Amnieh) during the course of a shooting trip. He was arrested on the ground that he had been used as an intermediary between the British and a local brigand, and it is believed that he was subsequently forced to sell his property and move to Azerbaijan. Another unfortunate victim was the owner of a small country house near Meshed which was rented by Major Hamber. This man was arrested and sent to Tehran after having been closely interrogated on his relations with the British. It appeared that Major Hamber’s visits to the house (he used to go there regularly for the week-ends) had aroused the suspicion of the military. The third arrest was equally connected with Major Hamber and arose out of a request from him to be allowed to shoot in the Bujnurd area. His request was refused and the Turcoman landowner under whose auspices he had proposed to shoot was arrested. 135. In the absence of His Majesty’s Minister these cases were taken up very strongly by Mr. Mallet with M. Soheily. The latter seemed genuinely horrified and said that he would mention the matter to the Shah. Later he said that he had taken it up with the Ministry of War and the Ministry of the Interior. He had not yet received replies, but he thought that all would be well. In any case he undertook to do his best. This latter conversation took place on the 9th December, but nothing further had been heard by the end of the year. (b) Discussions with the Iranian Government on Baluchistan Frontier Questions. 136. At the very beginning of the year the Prime Minister informed His Majesty’s Minister in the course of a general conversation on Anglo-Iranian relations that the Iranian Government were having difficulties with their Baluchi tribes, and appealed for greater support from the Government of India. Could the lattei not make it clear to the tribes that they would receive no encouragement on the Indian side of the frontier and could not more effective steps be taken to disarm tribesmen who crossed the frontier and to control local arms traffic? M. Feroughi’s language was extremely vague, but he implied that local tribesmen felt certain that they would always enjoy support or at the very least lenient treatment on the Indian side of the frontier. 137. His Majesty’s Minister vigorously countered the implication that Baluchi tribesmen were m any way encouraged by the British authorities, and he later sent the Prime Minister a letter in which he referred to the denials given by former British Ministers of similar charges made in the past, but stated that he would be prepared to examine M. Feroughi’s suggestions further, if the latter would furnish him with more precise details. 138. The Prime Minister in reply made it clear that the Iranian Govern ment brought no accusations against the British authorities, but that the point they wished to make was that ignorant tribesmen might believe and mioffit be encouraged by interested persons to believe in the existence of a certain decree of British sympathy. What his Government sought was that such tribes should not only not be encouraged, but should be discouraged. The Prime Minister finally stated that further facts could be furnished at Zahidan and said that he would be willing to instruct the local authorities there to put themselves in touch with a British representative, should His Majesty’s Minister desire to go into the matter more closely. 139. As Plis Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Govern ment of India both agreed that discussions on the spot might do much to dispel23 existing suspicions and misunderstandings, it was arranged that a meeting should take place at Zahidan at which the British representatives would be the military attache to His Majesty’s Legation, His Majesty’s consul-general for Khorasan and Mr. Skrine, Political Agent, Kalat and Chagai. It being an understood thing that all accusations against the British authorities were dropped, the object of % ^^ l the meeting would be to examine the possibility of measures to assist the Iianian Government in future. 140. Discussions were accordingly held at Zahidan between the and the 21st February, the delegates on the Iranian side being General Jehanbam, Inspector-General of the Army, and a Colonel Arfa (who is half-English ^ n d is married to an Englishwoman). The general, who is an old friend of both Colonel Daly and Mr. Skrine, was, however, only present at one or two of the meetings. 141. It unfortunately soon became clear that Colonel Arfa’s primary object was to present a formidable list of indictments against the British. Many of these were easily disposed of, but others were so vague that it was impossible to produce any actual evidence to disprove them. The British delegates therefore tried to transfer discussions from the past to the future and were considerably surprised to hear that Colonel Arfa’s instructions precluded him fiom eithei making suggestions himself or listening to any proposals which the British representatives might put forward. 142. When at last Colonel Arfa succeeded in obtaining fresh instructions, the British representatives communicated to him orally the measures which t e Government of India had adopted or were prepared to adopt to assist the Iranian authorities. These were— (1) Armed bands of refugees were, and would continue to be, disarmed and required to furnish security for their good behaviour; (2) Any arms found in the possession of refugees which had been stolen from the Iranian armed forces would be returned to the latter; (3) Arms would not be restored to refugees if they desired to return to Iran whilst hostilities were in progress against the Government; (4) Specific tribal leaders whose presence near the frontier might embarrass the Iranian Government w^ould be removed to the interior; (5) The Government of India would proclaim to Baluchi tribesmen in British territory that any form of assistance to or intrigues with Iranian Baluchis in revolt against the Iranian Government would be severely dealt with; . . (6) Levies on duty near the frontier would at all times be m uniform; (7) In order to minimise clashes with Iranian patrols, levies would not, except in cases of emergency, patrol up to the limits of the frontier; (8) Arrangements would be made that the majority of the personnel of frontier levy posts should consist of men from tribes other than those of the locality in which the posts were situated and that the commanders of these posts should not be men of such local tribes. In return the Government of India would ask the Iranian Government on theii side to make an important contribution to this policy of co-operation by arlanging for closer relations between the responsible military authorities m the frontier areas and the local British consular officers. 143. Colonel Arfa unfortunately received these proposals with very ill-grace and, after stating that they represented only the bare minimum of assistance which the Iranian Government had a right to expect from a friendly Power, advanced three additional suggestions :— (1) A system of frontier commissars should be established; (2) The Government of India should refuse to restore to refugees returning to Iran any arms which might have been confiscated from them on their entry into British territory; and (3) The Government of India should remove from the frontier area not merely individual tribal leaders, but all refugees whose presence there might be regarded by the Iranian Government as undesirable. [12998] c 424 144. The cause of the ultimate breakdown of the conference was not, however, disagreement over future policy, but the refusal of the Iranian delegates to drop the accusations of the past by furnishing a written statement that they acknowledged the goodwill and intentions of the British Government and accepted the assurances of the British delegation that responsible British authorities were^ not implicated in any of the incidents mentioned by the Iranian delegates. The British delegates felt that they could not communicate in writing the above- mentioned proposals of the Government of India unless they first obtained an assurance from the Iranians that they withdrew their accusations against British authorities, and the refusal of Colonel Arfa to furnish such an assurance accordingly put an end to the conference. 145. On the return of Major Pybus to Tehran, His Majesty’s Minister addressed a letter to the Prime Minister deploring the attitude which had been adopted by the Iranian delegates, and stating that, while ready to continue discussions, he must first receive a categorical assurance that all accusations and insinuations against British authorities were definitely abandoned. The Prime Minister’s reply was somewhat evasive in its terms, but it reiterated his former statement that he was making no accusations, and it was accordingly decided that conversations might be allowed to proceed. 146. The first idea was that a series of meetings might take place between His Majesty’s Minister and Major Pybus and the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs and General Jehanbani. But for various reasons, and chiefly because of the frequent absence of the general from Tehran, no formal meetings were ever held and all subsequent discussions were carried on with officials of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs alone. 147. His Majesty’s Minister first communicated to M. Soheily a memorandum explaining the position of the Government of India and indicating the measures which they were prepared to take. It also contained their reasons for not being able to agree to the institution of a system of frontier commissars, which they regarded as unworkable in any case and which had, further, the great objection that it would completely side-track British consular officers in East Iran. 148. The Iranians then made a number of suggestions, the principal one being that arms confiscated from refugees should not be restored to them when they recrossed the frontier. The Government of India felt unable, however, to commit themselves further than they had already done, but agreed to a number of minor points raised by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. On their side, the Iranians seemed ready to abandon their proposal for frontier commissars. 149. Finally, however, the Iranians appeared to lose interest in the whole matter, and, though His Majesty’s Minister communicated to M. Soheily in September the draft of a note which he would be prepared to address to him officially to confirm the proposals of the Government of India, matters had not advanced a single stage further by the end of the year. The probability is that the Iranian Government, seeing that they could not obtain all their desiderata, preferred to nurse their grievances rather than acquiesce in an arrangement which they could not regard as wholly satisfactory. 150. During the course of the year M. Motamedy made a number of oral requests for the extradition of robbers and others who had fled across the frontier, and for the return of arms stolen from Iranian guards. He was always informed that requests for extradition could not be entertained, but it more than once proved possible to trace and restore property stolen from the Iranian forces. (c) Demarcation of the Baluchistan Frontier. 151. This question was considered afresh at the time of the Zahidan Conference in February, but it was decided that it was not in the interests of the Government of India that the sector from boundary pillar No. 11 to Koh-i-Malik Siah should be demarcated. No mention of it was therefore made. 152. M. Kazemi, however, raised the matter with His Majesty’s Minister in September, though he made only a passing allusion to it. He said that the Iranian Government desired to see all their frontiers demarcated, and in enumerating them mentioned Baluchistan.25 153. In view of M. Kazemi’s remarks, it was therefore considered desirable to review the question when His Majesty’s Minister reached Delhi, lest M. Kazemi should raise it himself when he arrived. The position was that in the northern undemarcated sector British patrols patrolled up to what is known as the McMahon line. No claim to this line could, however, be supported by written agreements, and a retreat to the undoubtedly correct Bomford line would involve the sacrifice of two, if not three, British posts and would prove inconvenient in a number of other ways as well. It was therefore decided that, if the Iranians raised the question of demarcation, efforts should be made to divert their attention to the much longer southern undemarcated sector, pointing out at the same time, however, that there appeared to be no practical necessity to incur the heavy expenditure that would be entailed by demarcation in such difficult and desolate territory. / 154. But while this question was not mentioned by M. Kazemi in Delhi, it seemed not improbable at the end of the year that the incident at Gorich Kalag (see section II (A) (3) (i)) would cause the Iranian Government to revive it. (d) Commandeering of Indian Lorry Drivers. 155. Reports were received at the beginning of the year that the Iranian military authorities at Zahidan had recently commandeered a number of Indian drivers with their lorries to transport rations to Kwash. Hostilities were at the time in progress with insurgent Baluchis and two of the drivers had been killed and several wounded. 156. The matter was at once taken up by His Majesty’s Minister, who pressed strongly for the immediate cessation of such commandeering and for the payment of compensation in respect of all injuries and losses sustained. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs at first attempted to argue that all supplies for the garrison at Kwash were carried under contract by two Zahidan merchants, that the latter were responsible for all arrangements, and that the military had not intervened in any way. His Majesty’s consul-general for Khorasan confirmed definitely, however, that commandeering had taken place, and the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, when pressed, was quite unable to uphold the above argument. 157. M. Soheily then stated that stringent orders had been sent to Zahidan that no more Indian drivers were to be sent into the disturbed area. This was satisfactory, but there remained the question of compensation, and it was decided that this point could best be raised at Zahidan at the moment of the conference on Baluchistan frontier questions. 158. The matter, though not raised at the actual conference, was accordingly discussed by Colonel Daly with General Jehanbani, who admitted that drivers had been commandeered by the military and that the escorts provided had been quite inadequate. He also adopted a sympathetic attitude with regard to the claims for compensation and advised Colonel Daly to submit them direct to the Governor-General at Zahidan. This Colonel Daly did on the 15th February, and he later learnt that the claims had been forwarded to Tehran with a recommen dation from General Jehanbani that, compensation should be paid. 159. Details of four more claims which it had not been possible to submit with the others, as the drivers had all left for Meshed, were later forwarded to His Majesty’s Legation by Colonel Daly, and on the 23rd May His Majesty’s Minister transmitted them to the Iranian Government with the request that they should be settled with the others. Details of yet another claim reached the Legation in June. This was also forwarded to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and the grand total claimed as compensation then reached the sum of nearly 75,000 rials (about £850). 160. Meanwhile, His Majesty’s Minister mentioned the matter to M. Soheily at frequent intervals and pressed strongly for an early settlement. The latter eventually promised to raise it with the Shah, but later said that, when he had done so, His Majesty had made no very articulate response. In order to assist him, therefore, His Majesty’s Minister sent him early in July a comprehensive memorandum, of which he undertook to make the best use he could.26 161. Still no answer was received on the main question, though in August the Ministry for Foreign Affairs sent an unsatisfactory reply in regard to the four lesser claims which had formed the subject of His Majesty’s Minister’s note of the 23rd May. His Majesty’s Minister therefore spoke most seriously to M. Kazemi and M. Soheily, urging the deplorable effect that would be produced if the matter w T ere not soon settled. In spite of frequent reminders, however, and of periodical assurances from M. Soheily that developments were taking place, nothing further was achieved by the end of the year. 162. In the autumn it was necessary to repatriate to India one of the drivers concerned. He was by then quite destitute, being unable to drive a lorry owing to the loss of the use of his right hand. 163. Soon after the receipt in December of the Iranian complaint over Gorich Kalag (see section II (A) (3) (i)), information was received that the military authorities at Zahidan had again commandeered a number of Indian lorries and forced them to transport troops and material to Kwash. The matter was at once strongly represented to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, but no developments had taken place by the end of the year. (e) Pilgrims. 164. Much correspondence took place during the course of the year in regard to the treatment of Indian pilgrims by the Iranian authorities. The Government of India had previously decided that it would be inexpedient for them to proceed to measures which might be interpreted as calculated to restrict or prohibit the flow of pilgrim traffic to Meshed, but they agreed that representations might be made to the Iranian Government in regard to the manner in which pilgrims were treated, and that it might further be hinted to them that excessive zeal on the part of the customs authorities and harsh police methods could in the long run only tend to dry up the stream. 165. His Majesty’s Minister accordingly handed privately to M. Soheily in October a memorandum outlining the existing unsatisfactory state of affairs. Pilgrims entering the country at Mirjawa frequently had their luggage searched as many as four times before reaching Meshed, and in general they were exposed to numerous petty annoyances at the hands of the customs and the police. Often articles were confiscated and fines levied on them. Individual complaints could seldom be followed up, as pilgrims were not willing to delay, possibly for a considerable time, while their cases were investigated, and the situation was therefore now being represented to the Iranian Government in general terms in the hope that they would agree that nothing but good would result from a more sympathetic treatment of pilgrims by the authorities concerned. 166. A few days later information was received that a party of pilgrims has recently been held up by the customs at Damghan for twenty-four hours, that all the ladies’ saris had been confiscated and that they had been fined the sum of approximately £35. The case was, in fact, such a shocking one that it was decided to take it up separately, and an official note was therefore addressed to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs asking that the confiscated articles should be returned and the fine reimbursed. 167. The general question of the treatment of pilgrims was also strongly represented to M. Motamedy during his visit to Delhi in November. He was generally sympathetic, but offered the excuse that, despite the great progress made by Iran under the segis of the Shah, there were still many officials who did not know their job properly and therefore behaved unreasonably. He seemed fully to appreciate, however, that it was strongly in Iran’s own interest that foreign visitors to this country should depart with pleasant recollections of their stay. 168. No replies had, however, been received by the end of the year in regard either to the main question or to the above-mentioned incident at Damghan. (f) Expulsion of British Subjects. 169. Reports were received from time to time during the course of the year that the authorities (chiefly at Meshed and Zahidan) were proposing to expel certain individual British subjects. I he reasons for their decision were seldom27 given. When it appeared in any particular case that a miscarriage of justice was taking place or that the proper procedure had not been followed, the matter was taken up with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. No satisfaction in such cases was, however, ever received. 170. The question of expulsions assumed quite different proportions, however, after the riots which took place in July in the shrine at Meshed. Although the local authorities assured His Majesty’s consul-general that no British subjects were involved in the disturbances, notices of expulsion were served on about a dozen British Indian subjects, mostly Berberis, one of them being Colonel Daly’s cook. The authorities declined to give any reason for their action, and Colonel Daly feared that it was only a prelude to the expulsion of all British Berberis from the Meshed area. 171. His Majesty’s Minister at once referred the matter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, emphasising the refusal of the police to give any explanation of their action, and the great inconvenience that would be caused by the expulsion of any of the servants employed in His Majesty’s consulate-general. He also reminded M. Kazemi of the admission made by the Meshed police that no British subjects were suspected of complicity in the riots, and requested that he might be informed immediately of the reasons for such arbitrary orders of expulsion. 172. To this note M. Kazemi replied at the end of August, stating that the authorities had decided to banish all Berberis of foreign nationality who were implicated in the recent incidents at Meshed, and that, should any Berberis of British nationality be among them, they would naturally come under the general order. His Excellency then went on to maintain that any Government had the right to expel foreigners from its territory, and that no necessity existed for the authorities to give the reasons for their action in any given case. 173. At the same time, however, it was learnt from Colonel Daly that the orders of expulsion have not been proceeded with and that they were generally understood to be cancelled. Moreover, no fresh orders of expulsion have been issued against any other British subjects. 174. As it thus appeared that the authorities, though refusing to admit it, had, in fact, climbed down, His Majesty’s Minister replied in a conciliatory vein, arguing only that it would conduce to the avoidance of misunderstanding if the authorities in such cases were to inform His Majesty’s consular representative of the reasons for their action. It was the duty of every Government to protect the interests of its own nationals, and the refusal of such information could only have the effect of creating difficulties and impairing good understanding. 175. M. Kazemi had by this time left for Geneva, and M. Soheily’s reply, which contained a friendly assurance of the desirability of co-operation, made it possible to regard the incident as closed. 176. In November five Indians were expelled from Meshed, one of them being a petty mullah from the Kurram who had been among those ordered to leave in August. Consideration of these cases showed that great exception could be taken to the operation of the existing procedure. In the first place, the persons concerned were given no reasons by the police for their action. It was thus quite impossible for them to draft appeals to the Ministry of the Interior which would have the faintest chance of success. Secondly, no written reply was ever received to those appeals, the men receiving merely an oral intimation from the local police that they had been rejected. Finally, no period of grace was given them to settle up their affairs, but they were put across the frontier immediately. It was accordingly decided at the end of the year to raise the whole question of procedure with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and to urge the adoption of a fairer system. (g) The Hart Case. 177. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, having examined all the circumstances of the hold-up of which Mr. and Mrs. Hart were the victims (see paragraphs 160-165 of the annual report for 1934), decided that a claim should be made against the Iranian Government for the reimbursement of all losses and expenses (which the Minister for Foreign Affairs had already statedwould be paid) and for the sum of £500 as compensation for Mrs. Hart in respect of her serious injuries. 178. A claim on these lines was accordingly presented to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs early in February, the total sum asked for being m the region of £775. 179. As usual, frequent reminders proved necessary before a reply could be extracted, and when the latter arrived at the end of May it was seen that the Iranian Government were only prepared to reimburse the actual losses and expenses incurred. The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs at the same time explained orally that the reason for the refusal of the Iranian Government to pay the £500 asked for as compensation was that they were afraid of creating a precedent. 180. The matter was then further considered, and when it became known that Mrs. Hart’s arm was still partially disabled and that an operation by a specialist in England followed by prolonged electrical treatment was now regarded as essential, it was decided that the soundest course would be to put forward an immediate request for £250 to cover the cost of such treatment and of any other future expenses. Payment of this sum by the Iranian Government would be regarded as closing the incident. 181. This further request was submitted to the Iranian Government on the 14th July and was accepted by them a month later. Their promise to pay the sum asked for was, however, accompanied by a number of observations designed to show that no responsibility fell on the Iranian Government and that payment was solely an act of grace. 182. His Majesty’s Minister made it clear to M. Soheily that it was extremely difficult for him to accept some of the assertions made by the Iranian Government, but that, as the case was now satisfactorily closed and the money paid, he did not propose to engage in further polemics. The Foreign Office subsequently expressed approval of this attitude. (h) Brigandage. 183. A state of insecurity still continued to prevail on the Meshed-Birjand road. A postal lorry was fired on during the course of the summer, and one day in August a party of bandits held up all traffic from 9 a.m. till sunset. One Iranian was killed and two wounded, and a British Indian doctor was robbed of all his effects. 184. His Majesty’s Minister mentioned the matter privately to M. Soheily early in October, and said that he felt particularly concerned at the state of affairs in view of the forthcoming move of His Majesty’s consul-general from Meshed to Zabul. M. Soheily replied that he was aware of the existing unsatis factory situation, but that some action had already been taken to improve it. He promised to make further enquiries. 185. Colonel Daly was provided with an escort of Amnieh for his journey to Zabul at the beginning of December, and the same escort accompanied Mr. Loxley a week or so later from Zabul back to Meshed. 186. A state of insecurity was also held by the authorities to prevail on the road from Meshed to Turbat-i-Sheikh Jam, and escorts were provided on two separate occasions in October for members of the Legation travelling along it. 187. Towards the end of the year serious steps were taken to capture the chief brigand who was causing so much trouble. Apparently he had latterly taken to robbing villages and the villagers had sent a telegram of protest to the Shah, who was believed to have issued orders that he must be apprehended without further delay. Despite considerable activity on the part of the authorities, however, he was still understood to be at large at the end of the year. 188. In February a caravan travelling from Kwash to Iranshah was looted by Baluchi insurgents and two British Indian subjects were killed. Some of the robbers fled to British territory and were arrested and imprisoned.29 (i) Incident at Gorich Kalag. 189. A note was received from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the 12th December alleging that on the 29th November a British officer with eighty armed men had occupied two farms at a place called Gorich Kalag, which lay within Iranian territory, and had dug trenches round them. The note went on to express the amazement and astonishment of the Iranian Government at this encroachment on the part of British armed forces and requested that early steps should be taken to evacuate Iranian territory. 190. Information received a few days later from the Government of India showed, however, that Gorich Kalag was indisputably situated in British territory and was over a mile within the frontier. It has recently been regularly visited by British patrols and a detachment of thirty-one men of the Mekran Levy Corps had been sent to occupy it, as it was locally rumoured that the Iranian forces at Kulak were preparing to seize it. In consequence of this and the Iranian protest, the strength of the Iranian forces at Kulak had now been raised to 290. 191. On the 19th December His Majesty’s Minister, who had not as yet official instructions, informed M. Soheily .unofficially of the above facts. Four days later he saw him again and showed him a map on which the position of Gorich Kalag had been indicated in accordance with the information received from India. M. Soheily then sent for the map based on the boundary delimitation agreement of 1896 and bearing the signature of Sir Mortimer Durand and the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, and found that on it Gorich Kalag was marked by name and appeared even further inside British territory than His Majesty’s Minister had indicated. 192. There seemed little more to be said, but His Majesty’s Minister, never theless, raised the matter on Christmas Eve with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, intending to say that the Government of India feared that the concentration of Iranian troops might lead to an incident and to ask that stringent orders might be sent to the local commander to take no action which might lead to a clash. M. Kazemi interrupted him, however, to say that he understood that His Majesty’s Minister had agreed to a mixed commission to examine the locality. Needless to say, no such idea had ever been mentioned before. 193. Two days later M. Kazemi sent M. Motamedy round to propose that the Iranian Government should send representatives, including a member of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, to examine the place, and to ask that the British force at'Gorich Kalag should be reduced or withdrawn. His Majesty’s Minister replied that both suggestions were quite unjustifiable. The position of Gorich Kalag had been determined beyond all doubt, while it was absurd to ask that the British forces should be withdrawn while Iranian troops were still concentrated at Kuhak. 194. Next day, the 27th December, His Majesty’s Minister received a letter from M. Kazemi, despatched before M. Motamedy’s call. This letter said that it had been “ decided that representatives should be sent to the place,” and made the same request for the withdrawal of the British forces. 195. A telegram having been received that same day showing that the Iranian Minister in London had raised the question on similar lines, His Majesty’s Minister at once sent a reply to M. Kazemi, repeating in substance what had already been said to M. Ala, namely: — {a) That His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom could see no case for a mixed commission; (b) That there was no reason why the local Iranian authorities should not go up to the clearly defined frontier line and thus see for themselves that the place was not in Iranian territory; but (c) That they must on no account cross the frontier or risk an incident. His Majesty’s Minister finally stated that the further retention of the Iranian force at' Kuhak could not fail to produce the worst possible impression. Once it was withdrawn, however, he felt confident that the British force would be reduced to normal. 196. A further letter, written in a more conciliatory tone, was received from M. Kazemi before the end of the year. In this he again said that two or three30 officials were being sent to the frontier to obtain accurate information, but added that he had no wish to doubt the statement made by His Majesty’s Minister or the goodwill of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. 197. The origin of the trouble probably lay in the fact that the one family living at Gorich Kalag had always paid taxes to the Iranian Government. The v Government of India were naturally previously unaware of this, but they stated that the Chief of Kharan, in whose territory the place lay, had probably never thought it worth while to collect taxes there as it lay fully a week’s march from his headquarters. (j) Zahidan Railway. 198. No reply was returned to the suggestion made privately at the end of 1934 by the Minister of Finance through the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company that he should meet His Majesty's Minister and discuss the question of the Zahidan Railway. In March, however, M. Davar made fresh overtures by instructing the Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Finance to inform the oriental secretary that the Iranian Government would be very pleased if the section as far as Mirjawa could be reopened. 199. The matter was again raised in July by the head of the Economics Section of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, who informed the Commercial Secretary that the Iranian Government were anxious to develop more satisfactory trading relations with India and that they regarded the Zahidan-Nok Kundi route as the only practicable one for goods imported into or exported from East Iran. The link between Mirjawa and Nok Kundi was, however, a very unsatis factory one at present, and the Iranian Government would therefore be very glad if the railway could be put in order again as far as Mirjawa. Should this be impossible, they wondered whether steps could be taken to put the road in a more reasonable state of repair. 200. The matter was also raised on similar lines by the Iranian Legation in London and by the Iranian consul-general at Delhi. 201. It being the policy of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India not to relinquish the bargaining counter which the railway represented except in return for a substantial quid fro quo, no definite replies were returned to any of the above enquiries, as the moment did not seem opportune for discussions. When it became known, however, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs proposed to visit Delhi in November and that he was anxious to discuss commercial matters, the matter was reviewed afresh, and it was decided that a departure might be made from the policy of linking the reopening of the railway with a corresponding concession by Iran in the Gulf to the extent of discussing the question with M. Kazemi on general terms. 202. After consultation with His Majesty’s Minister, the Government of India decided that, while no formal decision could be taken during M. Kazemi’s visit and while any definite proposals would have to be referred to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, the matter might well be represented to M. Kazemi on the following lines :— (a) The reopening of the railway in the present circumstances of inter national trade would inevitably involve the Government of India in considerable financial loss. Such loss they could not even be prepared to consider incurring, unless and until the Iranian Government on their side undertook to accord much better treatment to the Indian community in East Iran than they had recently been giving; (b) Subject to a satisfactory response on the part of the Iranian Government under (a), the Government of India would be prepared to consider the matter on its financial merits, but they would certainly demand some relaxation of the restrictions which hampered Indian exports to Iran; and (c) Certain technical points, such as the question of separate stations at Mirjawa, would have to be satisfactorily settled before any general agreement could be reached.203. As is stated elsewhere in this report, M. Kazemi refused himself to discuss any questions while in India, but the position was explained on the above lines to M. Motamedy by Mr. Caroe. On his side M. Motamedy abstained from going into details, and stated simply that his Government were anxious to see the present system of communication improved and that, if there were difficulties over reopening the railway, they would be almost equally satisfied if something could be done about the road. He seemed anxious to give the impression that the Iranian Government were not sufficiently interested in the railway to be willing to make any special concessions in return for its being reopened. (k) Visas for lorry drivers on the Zahidan-Nok Knndi Road. 204. The question of the treatment by the Iranian authorities of Indian lorry drivers working on the Zahidan-Nok Kundi road formed the subject of much correspondence during the course of the year. 205. Under the arrangement reached in 1931, long-term visas valid for three months are issued to both Iranian and Indian drivers working on the route. Such visas are, however, only granted in Zahidan, and Colonel Daly reported in the spring that the Iranian authorities were obstructing the working of this arrangements by refusing to Indians who had no previous connexion with the route entry visas which would enable them to go to Zahidan for the purpose of obtaining long-term visas. Thus only Indians who already possessed such long term visas were able to work on the route. Further, if any driver in the possession of a long-term visa proceeded beyond Nok Kundi, his visa was cancelled, and he was not allowed to return to Iran. 206. While the matter was under consideration, Colonel Daly reported that visas to work on the road had been requested for fifteen drivers of the newly formed East Iran Transport Company, a subsidised concern that was virtually controlled by the Government. Fearing that the company, by operating at uneconomic rates which no private owner could afford to charge, would drive the Indian drivers off even the Indian section of the road, the Government of India decided that these visas should not be granted. This step brought matters to a head as the Ministry for Foreign Affairs at once proceeded to complain, and it was then decided that the question could most profitably be discussed further while His Majesty’s Minister and M. Kazemi were in Delhi. 207. After certain preliminary discussions it was accordingly represented to M. Motamedy that, while the Government of India had no desire to exclude Iranian drivers from the Indian section of the route, they were not satisfied with the operation of the existing system, inasmuch as Indian drivers suffered certain disabilities to which Iranian drivers were not exposed. Furthermore, they were not prepared to see Indians driven off the Indian section of the route by competi tion from an Iranian concern working at uneconomic rates. They would gladly negotiate a fresh arrangement that would secure equal treatment for both Iranian and Indian drivers, such arrangement to include some provision for the fixing of rates of transport, but failing this they had no alternative but to maintain their existing restrictions on the lorries of the East Iran Transport Company. In reply to this M. Motamedy argued that the company in question had as its object to make a profit like any other concern and that the Government funds invested in it represented capital and not a subsidy; moreover, he did not see how it would be possible to reach an agreement to regulate freights, since they were constantly fluctuating. He agreed, however, in general terms that the best plan would be to devise a system that would be fair to both sides, and it was finally decided that Mr. Loxley should discuss matters further with Colonel Daly on his way back and that consideration of the matter should be resumed after his and M. Motamedy’s return to Tehran. 208. Mr. Loxley accordingly went into the matter at some length with Colonel Daly at Zabul and the position at the end of the year was that His Majesty’s Legation were awaiting the latter’s detailed recommendations. (4) Special Indian Relations. (a) Land Customs and Emhargos. 209. A protest was received from the Iranian Minister in London in December 1934 against the embargo imposed during the previous month on the32 importation of cut diamonds from Iran into India across the land frontier. While his note was under consideration, evidence was received that cut diamonds weie now entering India via Afghanistan and the Government of India theretore took steps to extend the prohibition to the Indo-Afghan frontier also. It tnus became possible to reply to M. Ala that this latest step should make it cleai beyond all doubt that it had never been the intention of the Government of India to^^ discriminate against Iran and that the sole object of their action had been to prevent the evasion by importers of the duty that would have been levied had the diamonds entered India by the normal sea route. 210. In March the head of the Economics Section of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs called on the Commercial Secretary to His Majesty’s Legation and said that his Government understood that the Government of India intended shortly to establish customs posts on their land frontier. He added that, while the transit trade was beneficial to Iran, it was a matter of comparative indifference to the Iranian Government if customs duties were levied on foreign products on the arrival at the Indian frontier. He was, however, very anxious that Iranian produce, more especially natural produce and, above all, dried fruits, should continue to be admitted into India free of duty. Mr. Simmonds told him in reply that, while he did not think that the Government of India would ever give an undertaking not to levy customs duty on imports from Iran, it was not, as far as he was aware, their intention at the moment to subject Iranian natural produce to such duties. 211. It was the intention of the Government of India to introduce a limited land customs regime on the 1st June, but the Quetta earthquake rendered it impossible to pursue the question, and further consideration of the matter was, therefore, indefinitely postponed. 212. Meanwhile, the rapid growth of exports of tea from India through Iran into other markets had led to representations from the tea interests in Ceylon and the Netherlands East Indies that India’s obligations under the tea restriction scheme were being evaded. The Government of India therefore felt it necessary to prevent the flooding of these markets by uncontrolled Indian exports at the expense of the other partners to the scheme, and they accordingly issued on the 31st August a notification extending the export licensing system to exports across the Iranian land frontier. At the same time India’s export quota was increased by approximately 2^ million lb., a figure which represented India’s basic exports to Iran. 213. Protests against this measure were received from the Iranian consul- general in Delhi and the matter was also raised by M. Motamedy during his stay there in November. It was explained to him that it had in no sense been the desire of the Government of India to restrict exports to Iran but that they had been forced to take action in view of their obligation under the international scheme and in view of the abnormal growth of exports via Zahidan since that scheme had come into force. The recent notification did not mean that exports via Zahidan would be restricted to any specified amount; all that was required was that such exports should henceforth be covered by a licence. With this explanation M. Motamedy seemed satisfied, especially when he was assured that no tax was levied on exports of licensed tea beyond a nominal due designed to cover the costs of administration of the licencing scheme. 214. The final weeks before the imposition of the licencing scheme saw a remarkable tea rush, Indian and Iranian lorries working at full speed to carry exports from Nok Kundi to Mirjawa. It was believed that by the date the system entered into force, huge quantities of tea were lying in the warehouses at Zahidan. (b) Visit of His Majesty's Minister and of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to Delhi. 215. It was decided during the course of the summer that it would be of great advantage if His Majesty’s Minister could discuss with the Government of India a number of questions affecting Indo-Iranian relations, and he was therefore authorised to pay an official visit to Delhi in November.216. Later, the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Mr. Knatehbull- Hugessen that he was going to visit Kabul in November and would return via India. The Government of India at once offered to provide him with all possible facilities for his journey and his Excellency the Viceroy invited him to stay, should he be able to extend his journey, and pay a visit to Delhi. This invitation ^ he promptly accepted. 217. M. Kazemi then stated that he was anxious to bring experts with him to discuss commercial matters, but it was agreed that it would not be possib e to hold more than preliminary conversations on general lines. M. Motamedy, head of the department in the Ministry which deals with British affairs, later ampli ed M. Kazemi’s remarks and said that the questions which he particularly wished to discuss were the Zahidan Railway, Indian tea exports via Zahidan visas tor Iranian drivers to operate on the Zahidan—Nok Kundi road, and the impoi duties on Iranian wines and turquoises. 218. His Majesty’s Minister arrived in Delhi on the 16th November, and on the following days held a number of discussions with members of the Govern ment of India. Decisions were taken on the attitude to be adopted on all questions likely to come under review during M. Kazemi’s visit and numerous questions of mutual interest were also discussed. Great benefit should undoubtedly result from the direct liaison established between His Majesty s Legation and the Government of India. 219 M. Kazemi himself arrived on the 21st November, and it was then learnt with some surprise that he desired that his visit should be treated as one of courtesy only. But, while it thus became impossible to hold any detailed discussions with him, a meeting was arranged between M. Motamedy, M - No ^ r ^’ the Iranian consul-general in Delhi, Mr. Caroe, the Deputy Foreign Secretaiy, and Mr Loxley. At this meeting M. Motamedy raised the questions enumerated above, and Mr. Caroe, on the British side, spoke of the serious view which the Government of India took of the manner m which British Indian subjects weie treated by the Iranian authorities. Further details of the conversation are given in the relevant sections of this report. 220 In general it may be said that M. Kazemi appeared greatly pleased with the reception accorded'to him in Delhi. Very little publicity was however given to his visit in the Iranian press, in contrast to his visit to Kabul, which obtained considerable prominence in all the papers. (c) Consuls from the Foreign and Political Department. 221. It remained uncertain at the end of 1934 Whether the Iranian Govern- ment had or had not withdrawn their objections to consular °fheers fr °“ the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India. The appc ment In the spring of Captain Woods Ballard as consul at Bushire therefore seemed likely to prove somewhat of a test case. 222 After consideration had been given to the various alternative methods of raising the question afresh with the Iranian Government it was decidedthat the best course would be to apply for Captain Woods Ballar T d u S “ Zved ordinary way without giving any further explanations. These tactics proved Successful for, though tie head of the Protocol Department was-nt -und by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to enquire unofficially of His Majesty s Minute whether* no means coSld be found of meeting the Iranian point of view his approach was made very half-heartedly and no serious attempt was made to press the old objections. This appointment having been agreed to, no difficult es arose in obtaining the consent of the Iranian Government to the various other appointments of consuls from India that were made later m the year and the Iranian Government even agreed without demur to the appointment to Zahida of an officer on the active list of the Indian aimy. (d) Confiscation of an Indian Newspaper. . 223 In response to a complaint made by the Iranian consul-general m Delhi, the Governmen^of India confiscated two issues of an Indian - wspap- publmhed in Lucknow which contained poems defamatory of the Shah, t he Iranians wnne expressing considerable gratitude for this action, were at first anxious that the [12998] D34 editor should also be prosecuted or that the paper should be suspended for a period, but it was explained to them that the law did not provide tor suspension and that prosecution would result in considerable publicity in which attention would inevitably be drawn to the Meshed riots and the measures taken to suppress them. The matter was then tacitly dropped. (e) Flags on Iranian Consulates in India. 224. After discussion with His Majesty’s Legation, the Government of India requested the Iranian consul-general in Delhi at the end of August to restrict the days when the Iranian flag was flown on the consulate-general and on other consulates in India to Fridays, Iranian holidays and the gazetted holidays of the Government of India. 225. M. Nourzad forwarded this request to the Iranian Government, who agreed to it without demur. In November, however, he attempted to reopen the question, basing his arguments ostensibly on reciprocity, but claiming in fact most-favoured-nation treatment. (5) The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company {Limited). 226. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company enjoyed a year free from any serious disputes with the Iranian Government. Their new refinery at Kermanshah was opened on the 10th October, the ceremony being performed by the Prime Minister, who was presented with a gold and marble inkstand valued at £600 in honour of the occasion. It is understood that the cost of the whole installation, including the pipe-line, refinery and distribution depots in Northern Iran, was in the neighbourhood of £750,000. The throughput of the refinery is estimated at 20 million gallons per annum. (6) The Imperial Bank of Iran. 227. A settlement was reached in October of the Bank’s long-standing dispute with the Ministry of Finance in regard to the payment of royalties. The Iranian Government accepted a sum of £30,000 in full and final settlement of all royalties claimed, and in consideration of this payment confirmed that for the duration of their concession the bank would be exempt from the payment of all taxes and would have the right to obtain permits to import their requirements free of charge without the purchase of export certificates. In return the bank agreed to waive all claims against the Iranian Government on account of losses and damages occasioned to the property during the war. (7) Imperial Airways. 228. Only one complaint was received from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs during the year that an Imperial Airways machine had flown over Iranian territory. On enquiry it was learnt that visibility on the day in question had been very bad and that the pilot might have navigated over Jask, although he had no recollection of having done so. Suitable apologies were conveyed to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 229. Permission was obtained in April for an Imperial Airways machine to carry out a special charter flight in Iran, landing at Bushire, Shiraz, Isfahan, Tehran and Kermanshah. The American tourists who had chartered the machine later decided, however, to cancel their trip. (8) Claims. 230. The general examination and editing of the dossiers relating to British claims against the Iranian Government was completed during the year, and it was then considered what steps could usefully be taken in the hope of securing a settlement of such of the claims as His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom could support. No instructions had, however, been received in His Majesty’s Legation by the end of the year.[12998] 231. The Persian Railways Syndicate took legal advice during the course of the year with regard to the effect on their claim of the Iranian law of prescription. The period of prescription is ten years from the date on which payment became due, or on which liability was last acknowledged by the debtor ; and Dr. Naficy was inclined to hold, from a study of the papers submitted to him, that liability was last acknowledged in 1926 or 1927. He added, however, that the law of prescription would not be applied by the courts unless it was invoked by one of the parties to the case. The syndicate s statement of accounts was forwarded to the Iranian Government as usual at the end of the year. 232. A reply was received in May to His Majesty’s Minister s note of the 15th December, 1934, pressing for an impartial examination of the Persian Transport Company’s claim to compensation. The contention of the Iranian Government was that the arguments contained in that note involved an admission that the company had violated its concession. His Majesty s Minister was later instructed to reply that the object of his earlier note had on the contrary b ee ii to show that the company had not committed a breach of its concession, but had been constrained by force majeur. He accordingly suggested that the matter might be reconsidered. His note remained unanswered. (9) British Subjects in Difficulties. (a) General. 233. His Majesty’s Legation were constantly called on during the course of the year to intervene with the Iranian Government on behalf of British subjects who were the victims of arbitrary and often illegal action by the military authorities or the police. In general it seemed that the numbei ol such cases reported by His Majesty’s consular officers varied in proportion to the power of the military in the district concerned. 234 The task of securing justice for British Indian subjects proved especially hard; but, while unfortunately it was seldom possible to obtain redress for wrongs done in individual cases, it is to be hoped that the policy pursued of raising all the worst cases with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs will gradually lead to an improvement in the present unsatisfactory state of affairs. (b) Jehan Khan. 235. His Majesty’s Minister received instructions in February to inform the Iranian Government that, while he did not desire to pursue the case o Jehan Khan further (see paragraphs 226-231 of the annual report for 1934), he nevertheless adhered to the views expressed to them on the question oi principle that had been raised in regard to the diplomatic immunity of Legation servants. 236. Jehan Khan later secured the return of his confiscated property. (c) Mesopotamia Iran Corporation (Limited). 237 The corporation, in their capacity as Lloyd s agents, experienced considerable difficulties after the fire in the Mohammerah Customs-House at the end of July owing to the refusal of the authorities to furnish them with a full list of goods destroyed or damaged. The latter demanded that the corporation should first produce documentary evidence (a) that any given consignment was insured, and (b) that they were the agents of the underwriters concerned I he corporation maintained, on the other hand, that they were agents for underwriters all over the world and that the only way to proceed was to submit a full list ot all goods lost or destroyed to Lloyds for the information of underwriters. corporation experienced further difficulties owing to their inability to obtain for Lloyds any statement from the authorities in regard to the findings of the official commission appointed to enquire into the origin of the fire.36 (10) Legation Property. 239. It took His Majesty’s Legation the whole year to convince the Municipality of Tehran that they could not expropriate Legation piopei y in the same way as they acquired the property of private persons, giving on y derisory compensation in exchange, and that the Legation would not give up e ^ land required for their street-widening schemes except on paymen 0 6 rebuilding and other expenses and of a modest price for the actual land ce e . 240. As it seemed highly improbable that the Legation would ever succeed in obtaining, except perhaps at the cost of endless friction, the 120 rials w ic was the price asked for the land per square metre, they sought, and obtained, authority from His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom early m the year to reduce the price, if necessary, to 60 rials, provided that the municipa i y would agree to all their other terms. (The actual commercial value oi the land may be taken as being 240 rials.) This reduction in price was not, however communicated to the municipality at the time, but the latter were merely told that the question of the price of the land could not be discussed fuithei u^hd they had agreed to defray all expenses on account of rebuilding, &amp;c. ihe municipality’s first written offer, received in April, was that th e y would P^y 150,000 rials as a lump sum to cover everything; their subsequent offers steadily improved, and the position at the end of the year was that the Legation were awaiting written confirmation of an offer of 724,970 rials (about £8,000 at the then rate of exchange) on condition that they would rebuild the outer wall at their own expense. 241. This offer His Majesty’s Minister was in a position to accept, as the above sum represented the price originally asked, less the reduction in the price of the land, and as he had received authorisation to make a final concession over the rebuilding of the wall. (11) Consular Affairs. (a) Mails. K 242. The direct courier service between Delhi and His Majesty s consulates in East Iran via Quetta and Zahidan worked smoothly throughout the year. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs stated in January that the local authorities concerned had been instructed to grant courier’s visas to messengers carrying mail to the Foreign and Political Department, and a further difficulty which arose out of the fact that different couriers carried the mail in stages was solved when the Iranian consul-general in Delhi was authorised by his Government to issue courier’s visas on which the name and number of the passport of the courier did not occur. (b) Closure of His Majesty's Vice-Consulate at Resht. 243. The death in April of the munshi raised as an immediate issue the future of the vice-consulate at Resht. The post had been unfilled for over two years, but the munshi had addressed periodical reports to His Majesty’s Legation, and the system had been found to work well enough. But whereas no difficulties had arisen so long as the munshi was an old and trusted Government servant, it was felt that it would not now be possible to engage a new munshi who would be able to perform the same services. The alternatives of appointing a new vice-consul and reopening the post, or of closing the post altogether, were then considered, and His Majesty’s Minister finally recommended the definite closure of the post on the ground that there seemed at present no real need for a consulate in the Caspian area. His recommendation was approved and he was later instructed to take steps to dispose of the property. t (c) Consular Reorganisation. 244. Early in the year the Iranian Government signified their agreement to the amalgamation of the Isfahan and Shiraz consular districts. * 245. Owing to this and similar amalgamations which had taken place in previous years, and in consequence also of the reorganisation of the administrative divisions of the country, an attempt was made during the year to redefine all consular districts so as to cover the whole country. A complete list was therefore communicated to the Iranian Government in July for their approval. No definite reply to this note had, however, been received by the end of the year.(12) British Cultural Propaganda. 246. Modest beginnings were made during the year with a scheme of British cultural propaganda. Owing to the extreme suspicion wit 1C ^ British activities were regarded in Iran, it was necessary to proceed with great ^ caution; but the Minister of Education proved to be sympathetic ^d said that ^ he would greatly welcome a gift of books to be made to libraries m Tehran by the British Council for Relations with Other Countries. He also showed great interest in an offer from the Council of a selection of gramophone records ot lectures in English, asking, in fact, for an embarrassingly large number. 247. It was also suggested that a prize for English should be presente by the Council to the Church Missionary Society College at Isfahan. It was thought that an offer of prizes to Iranian schools would not be welcomed. (13) Closure of Iranian Honorary Consulates. 248. In consequence of a decision taken by the Iranian Government at the end of 1934 to abolish the appointment of all honorary consuls abroad, the 11 an ^ consulates at Manchester, Hull, Cardiff, Glasgow, Dublin and a ngoon w closed at the beginning of the year. It was agreed, howevei, that the consulate at Manchester would later be reopened under a consul de carnere. (B)— Iraq. (i) General. 249. The history of Irano-Iraqi relations in the year 1935 ^ the history of the developments arising out of the appeal addressed by Iraq to the Leagu Nations in December 1934. 250. When the dispute came before the Council on the 14th January, i appeared that the question to be dealt with was that of the validity of the Treaty of Erzerum and of the 1913-14 protocol, and although S ^ ld A ^ b M. Kazemi made references to the navigational problems in the Sh att-el-Arab they devoted the greater part of their speeches to legal arguments. But while it seemed that the obvious way out of the impasse be /° ^ to to the Permanent Court of International Justice, Iran firmly refused to a &amp; iee this course, in spite of the fact that Iraq, which was the party in possession, agieed at once and unconditionally to abide by the Court s decision. 251. Efforts were then made to establish a temporary modus vivendi on the disputed frontier, but it proved extremely difficult to And a formula, and matters were not rendered easier for Iraq by the behaviour of the ™VV°rteur Baron Aloisi, whose partiality in favour of Iran appeared to be dictated by ulterior motires of Italian policy. It was finally decided that bo h parties should make a declaration that they would refrain from action hkeiy to cause a deterioration in the local situation, and that discussions between them should subsequently be pursued in Rome under the auspices of the ra VV orteur. 252. Meanwhile, the Iranian delegates were lobbying actively for the support of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, and it needed numerous interviews to convince them that, while His Majesty s Government were 11 wavs ready to use their good offices to further a settlement of the practica difficulties that arose, no progress could be made m this field until the barrier represented by the juridical issue had been overcome. Meanwhile, they could only act as a good member of the League. . 253. The subsequent negotiations in Rome constitute a page in the histoiy of Iraq rather than in that of Iran, for their chief feature consisted of the difficulties encountered by Nuri Said in consequence of the manifest bias of Baron Aloisi in favour of the Iranian case. It therefore only seems necessary to mention here that at the beginning of February Nun Said as a result of advice given him in London in the course of a hurried visit which he paid during the Rome negotiations, made a direct approach to the Iranians by offering the immediate conclusion of agreements for a Conservancy Board, for the disposal of the transferred territories’ oil-field royalties and for a bon voismage arrangement on the understanding that Iran would recognise the existing frontier M Ala agreed to refer these proposals to Tehran, and it is just possible that they might have borne some fruit had not Baron Aloisi shortly afterwards [12998] D 338 produced a provisional agreement for the regulation of navigation on e Shatt-el-Arab, under which Iran would have obtained her chief desiderata m the practical sphere without the necessity of having to recognise 1913-14 me. This latter proposal was rejected by Nuri Said, and after Baron Aloisi a produced various other schemes, all of them unfair to Iraq, negotiations weie adjourned. On his return to Bagdad Nuri Pasha on the 17th February addressed a letter to Baron Aloisi repeating that Iraq could accept no frontier rectincation except under the ultimate direction of the Permanent Court, but was willing to offer Persia a series of practical remedies, including a Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Convention. 254. There then followed a period of quiescence which was broken in April by a series of tentative suggestions, made to His Majesty s Minister by M. Kazemi and M. Soheily, that the two parties should endeavour to reach a settlement by direct negotiations, aided by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, and by some desultory correspondence between the Iraqi Government and the rapporteur. M. Kazemi also made a direct appeal to His Majesty s Minister that His Majesty’s Government should assist Iran to obtain her desiderata in the Shatt-el-Arab, in return for which the Iranian Government would be ready to make certain corresponding concessions in the Gulf. Shortly afterwards he informed the new Iraqi Minister that he desired to avoid pressing the juridical question to an issue at Geneva as he was anxious to avoid a moral defeat for either Government. 255. There happened to be a certain advantage in these proposals so long as they would render it possible to side-track the Italian rapporteur, but there was little time to examine them before the next meeting of the Council, and considerable doubts were still felt as to whether the Iranian Government were yet ready to acknowledge the existing frontier. In any event, it was not found possible to pursue them further before M. Kazemi and Nuri Said left again for Geneva. 256. On this occasion Baron Aloisi delegated his functions to two of his subordinates, one of whom, the Marchese di Soragna, proved to be much more reasonable. Progress remained in many ways unsatisfactory, not least because of an unexpected deficiency in Nuri Pasha’s instructions which precluded him from communicating officially to the rapporteur full particulars of the draft Conservancy Board Convention and of the other 1932 proposals. Nor had M. Kazemi advanced far towards a realist viewpoint, as was shown when he produced a draft of a bipartite Conservancy Board Convention which incidentally assumed a median line frontier. Nevertheless, some advance was made when the Marchese di Soragna produced a “ pro jet de recommendations,” providing for the acceptance by Iran of the greater part of the 1914 frontier in return for an anchorage off Abadan. The “projet” also contained, however, some features which Nuri Said could not accept such as a five-Power Conservancy Board, and it was in no sense pleasing to the Iranians, who rejected it with indignation. 257. The rapporteur accordingly decided that he could do nothing but recommend that he be given further time in which to find a basis for a settlement, and that the two parties should also employ this time in direct discussions. The Iranians were clearly eager for an adjournment of this nature, and the Iraqis were too unprepared with proposals of a practical nature to be able to oppose it, so the rapporteur was easily able to secure the consent of both sides to his suggestion. The only noteworthy feature of the proceedings of the Council was, in fact, an entirely unexpected speech by the Turkish Foreign Minister, who appealed to both parties to settle the dispute, as in the case of the Turco-Iranian frontier, not on the basis of former treaties, but in a friendly and practical manner, and recalled the part played by the Shah in the Turco-Iranian settlement. 258. The next phase in the story also belongs primarily to Iraqi history, since it was mainly taken up with efforts made in Bagdad to induce the Iraqi Government to reach a definite decision on the practical issues at stake. Mention must, however, be made of an audience accorded to His Majesty’s Minister by the Shah on the 12th June, in which His Majesty, after expressing very friendly sentiments towards Iraq, declared that the juridical aspect of the matter was not important and that he relied on His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to find a solution of the whole question. Later, the Prime Minister gave the39 impression that, while the Iranian Government did not seem to have aban one hopes of securing recognition of their “rights” to the thalweg, it migi &gt;e possible to induce them to accept the 1913-14 frontier so long as some sateguar could be introduced under which Iran would always enjoy the undisturbed usufruct of the entire waterway. 259. It having been decided that the direct negotiations should take place in Tehran, Nuri Pasha, accompanied by the Iraqi Minister of Justice, Mr. Edmonds and Colonel Ward, arrived there on the 5th August. JNun s instructions had only been drawn up at the last minute and, in effect, th e y limited him to doing little more than make an extended enquiry designed to secure acceptance of possible heads of agreement, the details of which would be woiked out later. In particular, he had no authority to seek Iranian agreement to the complete draft Conservancy Board Convention, nor to make any definite proposal in regard to the Abadan anchorage. • * ♦ *■ 260. The Tehran negotiations pursued a course so tortuous that they almost defy summary. They opened with an oral statement made by M. Kazemi on the 8th August that— (a) The Iranian Government accepted the existing land frontier, (b) They asked for no alteration in the Shatt-el-Arab frontier, but did not wish this fact to be stated in any written document, and (c) The 1932 Conservancy Board draft would need further study by him before the next meeting. M. Kazemi implied, however, that the Iranian Government would not object to British participation. The following day M. Kazemi spoke to His Majesty’s Minister about point (b) above and, after stating that the Iraqis found difficulty m agreeing to this conspiracy of silence, asked whether the Foreign Office could ui gently suggest some formula that would satisfy both parties. 261. On the 12th August, however, M. Kazemi executed a typical volte face and put forward written proposals for a Treaty of Friendship and a bipartite Conservancy Convention, the terms of which presupposed a thalweg or median line frontier. Under the latter convention, moreover, each side would appoint two members to the board, which might then co-opt a fifth membei of anothei nationality. 262. Nuri Pasha’s reply to this was to hand to M. Kazemi a proces-verbal, containing proposals for the recognition of the 1913-14 line and for the establish ment of a conservancy board, the third member of which would be nominated by His Maiesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. Nuri Pasha at the same time explained to His Majesty’s Minister that his instructions did not permit him to suggest definitely that His Majesty’s Government should also be a signatory of the convention. 263. The next act opened with the receipt on the 15th August of a telegram from the Foreign Office stating that a formula of the kind suggested by M Kazemi was probably unattainable, and suggesting that the only satisfactory solution was a redefinition of the whole frontier. It might, however, be possible so to dress up the wording of the Conservancy Board Convention and the other subsidiary agreements that the whole transaction might seem on the face of it to be an Iranian success. Nuri Said proved willing enough to accept this suggestion, but M Kazemi declared that it was quite unacceptable, though he and the 1 rime Minister later implied that they would be willing to redefine the entire frontier on condition that Iran should be permanently safeguarded against the with drawal by Iraq of privileges accorded under the Conservancy Convention and allied agreements. The atmosphere of qualified optimism created by this advance was, however, short-lived, for M. Feroughi and M. Kazemi soon retreated again and'once more began talking about sovereignty. 264. Nuri Said was by now thoroughly despondent and accordingly sent M. Kazemi a letter summing up the position, stating that his presence was now required at Geneva and asking for an audience to take leave ot the Shah. M Kazemi’s reply either denied or took back every previous statement made on the Iranian side which seemed at all hopeful, and generally misrepresented the situation. [12998] D 4265. The situation thus seemed to have reached a complete deadlock, but at Nuri Said’s farewell audience the Shah, to the discomfiture of M. Feroughi and M. Kazemi, agreed to recognise the whole frontier in return for an anchorage oi one or two kilometres at Abadan. He went on to urge Nuri Said to remain and conclude certain heads of agreements, but the latter explained that he must leave in order to go to Geneva. It was arranged, however, that negotiations should be continued there forthwith on the above basis. 266. Nuri Said had still, however, to obtain clear instructions from the Iraqi Cabinet in regard to the Conservancy Board Convention, and the latter s eventual decision involved a fairly considerable departure from the existing scheme. Briefly it was that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom should be invited to participate in a tripartite convention, which should give the Iranians an equal voice in executive matters affecting navigation, but should accord them only supervisory powers in regard to dredging and other conservancy operations. 267. It was with these instructions that Nuri Said arrived at Geneva; but for various reasons the Irano-Iraqi question remained for some time in abeyance there, and when negotiations were resumed the Conservancy Convention was rather relegated to the background. Instead discussions seem to have centred primarily on the draft of a proposed Treaty of Friendship, one article of which was intended to redefine and finally establish the whole frontier line. No settle ment was reached, however, as the Iraqis had not yet decided on the limits of width to which they would attempt to restrict the Abadan anchorage, while M. Kazemi continued to press for its extension to the thalweg. It was eventually agreed that further negotiations should take place in November in Bagdad (a) for a Conservancy Board Convention, and (b) regarding the limits of the Abadan anchorage. Meanwhile, Nuri Said and M. Kazemi contented themselves with initialling a Turco-Irano-Iraqi Non-Aggression Pact and a bilateral treaty for the pacific settlement of disputes, drawn up in accordance with the model prepared by the League of Nations in 1928. 268. The following weeks were occupied by His Majesty’s Legation in endeavouring to secure the definite acceptance by the Iranian Government of the principle of a tripartite Conservancy Board Convention. M. Soheily seemed svmpathetic towards the idea, but said that he could not commit himself until the return of M. Kazemi towards the end of October; the latter was, however, evasive and attempted to put all the blame for the delay on Nuri Said, though he subsequently informed the Iraqi Minister that he was prepared to agree to British participation in the board. Shortly afterwards it emerged that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs had lost the 1932 tripartite draft and had not even got any later one in their possession. Noury Esfandiary, the Iranian expert who was to go to Bagdad for the negotiations, was accordingly working on the basis of the bilateral draft communicated to Nuri Said in August. Mr. Mallet there fore explained to him the arguments in favour of a tripartite convention, and added that a further objection to the existing draft seemed to be its omission of any reference to the Karun and Bahmanshir. Noury Esfandiary replied that he was still without instructions regarding British participation in the negotiations. 269. Later Mr. Mallet was authorised to communicate to him the latest 1935 draft, explaining the technical arguments in favour of the inclusion of the Bahmanshir, and adding that the draft had been put forward as a basis for discussion. On this second occasion Noury Esfandiary confirmed what M. Soheily had recently told the Iraqi Minister, namely, that the Council of Ministers had agreed to British participation in the negotiations, but that they still awaited the Shah’s approval, and had meanwhile telegraphed to M. Kazemi in India for his views. 270. Meanwhile, the Iraqi Minister had an audience with the Shah, and on instructions from his Government requested His Majesty to confirm that he had only asked for an anchorage one or two kilometres long at Abadan. The Shah seemed affronted at this request, and after some hedging took the line that he had asked for a frontage unspecified in length but roughly covering the whole port.41 271. Negotiations eventually only began in Bagdad in the latter part of December, and even then the Iranian Minister in Bagdad said that he was still without definite instructions in regard to British participation. 272. His Majesty’s Minister therefore called on M. Kazemi just before —.Christmas and enquired what the actual position was. The latter replied that M. Samii had been informed that the Iranian Government had no objection to British participation in the negotiations, but later admitted in answer to a direct question that this did not include their consent to the signature of the convention by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. He added that it had been agreed between himself and Mr. Eden at Geneva that the convention would only be an annex to the main Treaty of Friendship, and could therefore only be signed by Iran and Iraq. He had agreed, however, that the third member of the Board should he British. On His Majesty’s Minister’s replying that he knew that the view of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom was that negotiations should take place on the basis of the 1935 draft tripartite con vention, M. Kazemi said that he had never seen it and that his Government had not got it. 273. At the very end of the year His Majesty’s Minister received a telegram from the Foreign Office stating that M. Kazemi’s allegations were quite untrue and instructing him to explain the position to the latter, leaving him under no illusion as to the unpleasant impression which his adherence to his present attitude would produce on His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. 274. Meanwhile a meeting took place in Bagdad on the 30th December between Yasin Pasha, Nuri Pasha and M. Samii, at which M. Samn produced the story which M. Kazemi had told His Majesty’s Minister, and suggested that there was now no need to invite British delegates to take part in the negotiations. To this Yasin Pasha replied that the Iraqi Government had decided only to negotiate a Conservancy Convention on condition that His Majesty’s Govern ment in the United Kingdom were a signatory, and that they could not alter their decision unless His Majesty’s Government intimated that they did not wish to participate. 275 M Samii then read a passage from M. Kazemi’s telegram conveying strong advice to the Iraqi Government not to betray their interests into British hands by allowing His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to participate on an equal footing with the riparian States in the control of the Shatt-el-Arab This provoked an outburst from Yasin Pasha that the Iraqis were nottuch fools as to prefer to share control with the Shatt with the Iranian Government, who coveted some of their territory, rather than with His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom, who were their allies and had common interests to safeguard. 276. The year thus ended stormily. (2) Iraqi Legation in Tehran. 277 In March 1935 the Iraqi Government decided to appoint a new inister to the Iraqi Legation in Tehran which had for some time been m the nds of an amiable^but Sot very forceful Charge d’Affaires. At the same time ey appointed as counsellor the then Director-General m the Iraqi Ministry foi ireign Affairs. 278 Both the new Minister and his counsellor showed themselves to be very friendly to His Majesty’s Legation and consulted them constantly on questions of mutual interest. (3) Treaties and A greements. 279 The Provisional Agreement of 1929 was renewed in February, but was 'll,owed to lapse in August. The attitude of the Iraqi Government was that the Iranian Government should take the initiative and that, unless and until ey proposed a renewal, the Iraqi Government would take no action in the matter.42 280. The 1932 exchange of notes for the settlement of frontier disputes was duly renewed in June, though the Iraqi Government felt that it was of very i e use to them in view of the unhelpful attitude of the Iranian authonties. (C) Other Countries. (1) Turkey. 281. Relations with Turkey remained cordial throughout the year. 282. Early in the year the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs made somewhat tactless attempts to mediate in the Irano-Iraqi dispute and on two subsequent occasions the Turkish Ambassador at Tehran was instructed to ur t upon the Shah the desirability of reaching an early settlement. It cannot be said, however, that Turkish intervention produced any noticeable eftect. 283. Turkish nervousness about the possibility of Italian aggression later led the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs to press on with a scheme with which he had long toyed for some form of Middle-Eastern . n ° n ' a S8 r ®;f lc |? P c ^ ct - A pact between Turkey, Iran and Iraq was accordingly initialled by the Foreign Ministers of the three countries at Geneva in the autumn, Turkey havm 0 previously sought and obtained Russia’s consent to her participation. 284. Subsequently M. Kazemi became a great enthusiast for the pact. His efforts to secure the inclusion of Afghanistan are recorded m the section dealing with that country. But, while Turkey retained her position as Iran s best friend the Turkish Embassy in Tehran by no means always found it easy to deal with the Iranian Government, and their counsellor more than once complained to membei s of His Majesty’s Legation of Iranian bad faith and evasiveness. (2) Afghanistan. 285 The mixed commission appointed to enquire into the frontier incidents near Zurabad (see paragraphs 270-273 of the annual report for 1934) drew up their report at the end of January. They found that a few hundred families o tribesmen, who were Iranian subjects who had originally come from Afghanista , had migrated back to that country, doing certain damage to p wav and killing three road guards. It was agreed that no Afghan officials had been concerned in the incident, but the Afghan Government undertook to remove from the frontier two Afghans who had encouraged the tribesmen to act as the} did Thev further agreed to recover compensation from the tribesmen tor the damage which they had done in Iranian territory, to punish the murderers of the road guards and to restore the arms stolen from the latter. They finally promised to give all facilities to the tribesmen who had migrated to return to Iran if they desired to do so. 286. The truth of the matter appears to have been that these tribesmen emiorated from Iran because they were harshly treated by the local Iranian officials and that, despite all efforts made by the Iranian members of the mixed commission, nothing would induce them to return It is understood that t e Iranian Government subsequently imprisoned or dismissed a number ot tneir officials in the area in question. 287 The Turkish arbitral award on the disputed section of the frontier near Musabad (see paragraphs 268 and 269 of the 1934 annual report) was com municated to the Iranian and Afghan Ambassadors at Angora in May. A Bill ratifvin- it was passed by the Majlis in October and arrangements were also made for a mixed Iranian-Afghan Commission to give effect to it by erecting the necessary boundary posts. 288. The text of the award was not, however, published till November and owing to the difficulties of translation it was not found possible to study it m any detail before the close of the year. 289 The Minister for Foreign Affairs, accompanied by a number of officials of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, paid a visit to Kabul in November and was treated to an elaborate series of functions by the Afghan tbp nhippf of M Kazemi’s visit was to pay his respects to King Zahir bhah and to retlrn theWsiTpaW to Meshed by {he Afghan Minister for Foreign Affarrs43 during the previous year; but though nothing was officially disclosed, it may be taken as certain that one of M. Kazemi’s chief motives in undertaking the journey was to secure the adhesion of Afghanistan to the proposed Turco-Irano-lraqi Pact of Non-Aggression. It is understood that, while the Afghan Government showed no enthusiasm for the pact, they agreed to sign it in due course as they feared that refusal on their part to do so would be misinterpreted. 290. In (general M. Kazemi did not seem too pleased with the outcome of his visit and it cannot be said that 1935 showed Irano-Afghan relations to be particu larly good. On the one hand the Iranians claimed to have suffered endless difficulties from Afghan raids into Khorasan; on the other, the Afghan Ambassador in Tehran continued to refer to the Iranians through the year m terms of unconcealed contempt. (3) Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. 291. The opening of the Iranian Exhibition at Leningrad provided the occasion for a minor Irano-Soviet flirtation. A special Iranian delegation, led by M. Hekmat, the Minister of Education, attended the ceremonies and were given a warm reception; and a number of articles were published in the Iranian press, which displayed the most friendly sentiments towards the Soviet Union. 292 In October M. Kazemi visited Moscow on his way back from Geneva and was suitably entertained; and the eighteenth anniversary of the October revolution was made the occasion for the publication in the leading lehr an news papers of an article, presumably written in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, ot a distinctly complimentary nature. 293. It would be rash, however, to assume that the Shah had come to love the Soviet Government as dearly as any of the above manifestations might indicate. 294. An agreement was reached in May between the Iranian and Soviet Governments whereby the latter agreed to hand over the lighthouses erected by them on the Iranian coast of the Caspian. 295 M Pastoukhoff, the Soviet Ambassador in Tehran, was recalled from his post in April. He was succeeded by a M. Tchernikh, who had previously seen service in Latvia, Finland and China. 296. Soviet commercial interests are dealt with in section IV (B) (7) of this report. (4) Germany. 297. Many signs of increasing German activity were apparent during the year. A steady growth was to be noticed in the size of the German colony in Tehran, numerous itinerant business men arrived in search of orders, and German advisers were engaged by a number of Government Departments. The Iran-i- Bastan newspaper was undoubtedly in receipt of a German subsidy and its issues were always full of photographs of Nazi Germany, while a more important paper, the Iran, seemed to devote a disproportionate amount of space to German news. 298. An Iranian financial and economic mission visited Berlin in August and later concluded a clearing agreement with the German Government, of which details are given in section IV (B) (10) of this report. 299 A new German Minister, Herr Smend, presented his letters at the end of July, and thereafter displayed great energy in cultivating his colony and furthering their interests. (5) Italy. 300. Owing to the diversion of Italian energies elsewhere, Italian influence suffered a noticeable decline in the year under review. As is reported in section IV (B) (9), Italy showed no great signs of activity in the commercial field, though a number of small vessels ordered for the Iranian navy were delivered during the course of the year (see section VII (C) (4)). In the general sphere of policy the Italian Legation were thrown definitely on the defensive, as Iranian sympathies were all on the side of Abyssinia.44 301. The Italian cause was probably not helped by the fact that the Italian Minister was transferred to another post early in the summer, and that the Legation was thereafter left in the hands of a young Charge d’Affaires who grew more and more bitter, isolated and depressed as the year wore on. 302. The attitude of Iran towards the Italo-Abyssinian dispute is dealt with more fully under the section devoted to the League of Nations. (6) France. 303. A new Minister, M. Jean Pozzi, presented his letters in April. 304. A French sloop, the Bougainville, carried out a cruise in the Gulf in February. The Iranian ports visited were Bushire and Bandar Abbas. 305. During the absence on leave in the summer of the French consul at Tabriz, His Majesty’s consul took temporary charge of the consulate. 306. The increase of the strength of the French military mission is dealt with in section VII (A) (14). (7) Japan. 307. Japanese interests, which remained almost solely commercial, are dealt with in section IV (B) (8) of this report. 308. Two Japanese military attaches from other posts visited Iran during the course of the year (see section VII (A) (13). (8) United States. 309. The late American Minister, Mr. C. C. Hart, returned once more to Tehran at the end of 1935. It is understood that he was still in quest of oil concessions, but that he achieved little. After a short visit he departed for Afghanistan. 310. At the end of November the Iranian Minister at Washington was involved in an unfortunate incident in some small town in the United States. A fracas developed with a policeman who had stopped his car for speeding, and in the end he found himself under arrest. He was promptly released by the local magistrate and apologies followed; but the Iranian press adopted a violent tone, and the incident could not be regarded as closed by the end of the year. (9) Belgium. 311. Belgian commercial interests are dealt with in section IV (B) (11) of this report, and the activities of the Belgian air force mission in section VII (B) (10). 312. The Belgian Minister was transferred from Tehran in the autumn, the Legation being left in the charge of a newly-arrived Charge d’Affaires. (10) The Netherlands. 313. The Netherlands company that was engaged in the construction of the port of Noh Shahr (Deh Noh) on the Caspian obtained in the autumn a still larger contract for the enlargement of the port of Bander Shahpour (see also section VI (B) (2)). 314. The Netherlands Charge d’Affaires was promoted to the rank of Minister at the end of the year. (11) Roumania. 315. It was announced in the summer that a Roumanian Legation would shortly be opened in Tehran, the first Minister being M. Gregoire Constantinesco, who was at that time serving as counsellor in London. 316. An Iranian Legation at Bucharest was also established during the course of the year.45 (12) Switzerland. 317. It was announced in the summer that a Swiss Charge d’Affaires would shortly be appointed to Tehran. Nothing further happened, however, during the rest of the year. (13) Greece. 318. The establishment of a Greek consulate-general at Tehran was announced during the course of the summer. No consular representative had, however, arrived by the end of the year. (14) Yugoslavia. 319. A Yugoslav consul de carriere was appointed to I ehran during the course of the summer. (15) Latin American Countries. 320. Iran became diplomatically represented for the first time in Latin America, a Minister being appointed to reside at Buenos Aires. It is understood . that he was accredited to all Central and South American countries. (D) International. (i) League of Nations. 321. The Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs attended the January, May and September sessions of the Council in connexion with the Irano-Iraqi fiontiei dispute. 322. Following on the appointment of a committee to enquire into the question of the distribution of seats on the Council, M. Kazemi a-ddressed a lettei to the Secretary-General of the League requesting that a semi-permanent seat should be reserved for the Near-Eastern group of States, consisting of Iian, liaq, Turkey and Afghanistan. 323. Public opinion in Iran entertained no sympathy for Italy in her dispute with the League, and the Iranian Government associated themselves wit all the measures of sanctions adopted at Geneva, with the single reservation that certain Government contracts already placed with Italian firms should be allowed to stand. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs only agreed to publish one of the many communiques which the Italian Legation desired to issue, and then only did so on the condition that it was made clear that it was a communique from the Legation. 324. At first it seemed that there was a certain tendency in the press not to ' give proper publicity to the British point of view, but rather to distort it. His Maiesty’s Minister at once raised the matter with the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the latter then spoke to the Shah, who replied that he deplored such misrepresentation, and that the press should be summoned and the British standpoint explained to them. From then on no articles appeared to which exception could be taken. 325. The draft of the note which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom proposed to return to the Italian note of the 11th November protesting against sanctions was communicated to the Iranian Government. It then emerged that M. Soheily had had the Italian note in his hands for four days before he even read it. ‘Despite the efforts of His Majesty’s Legation, however, the Iranian reply eventually turned out to be rather a weak document. 326. A decree enforcing sanctions, corresponding closely to the LTnited Kingdom Order in Council, was passed by the Council of Ministers on the 18th November, and a few days later a Bill was submitted to the Majlis laying down penalties for any infraction of this measure.48 (3) International Instruments. 328. The International Convention for the Protection of Adult Women and the Convention for Facilitating the International Circulation of Educational Films, both dated the 11th October, 1933, were ratified by the Majlis on the ; 10th January, 1935, signed by the Shah on the 14th January, 1935, and registered' at Geneva on the 13th April, 1935. 329. The international agreement concerning automobiles dated the 24th April, 1926, and ratified by the Majlis on the 24th December, 1934, was signed by the Shah on the 1st January, 1935, entered at Geneva on the 18th April, 1935, and registered at Paris. 330. The conventions passed by the Universal Postal Union in Cairo on the 20th March, 1934, were sanctioned by a law of the Majlis dated the 10th April, 1935. III.— Internal Affairs (Political). (A) General. 331. The events of 1935 provide ample illustration of two of the main principles in the Shah’s creed : {a) the modernisation or westernisation of the country and (5) the ruthless crushing of all opposition to his will. 332. The evidences of westernisation are chiefly to be found in the com mercial field, and these are dealt with in the economic section of this report. But there must also be mentioned the suppression of the Pahlavi hat, which took place in June, the abolition of all honorific titles, such as Mirza, Khan, Beg, Amir and Seyyed, and of lengthy compliments and methods of address, which were regarded as inconsistent with the methods of bustle demanded by the modern age, and the beginnings of a movement to make women discard their veils. In his speech at the opening of the Majlis in June the Shah spoke earnestly of “ our deficiencies and the gravity of our needs,” called for increased efforts ” in our works and activities,” and declared that “the whole population must link their hands together for a concerted effort to reach the desired end.' To illustrate his desire that there should be more work and less circuses, he later ordained that his birthday, which was formerly made the occasion for elaborate festivities, should henceforth be celebrated at the same time as No Ruz, which falls a week later. Westernisation, or perhaps better, Americanisation, faster and faster, was indeed the order of the day. 333. In his ruthless suppression of carpers and critics the Shah had no need, however, to follow a foreign example; indeed, the “ Fiihrer ” of Iran may rather be regarded as the prototype of the Aryan Hitler. At any rate, he was at work first. During the year under review the first to fall by the wayside were a number of journalists and Deputies, who were understood to have expressed criticism of the regime and in particular of the budget. A number of arrests were made, but some of the culprits were allowed to leave the country, including Dadgar, the president of the Majlis. Whether the disgrace of General Ayrom, the Chief of Police, who left for Europe at the same time, was connected with the above events, it was never possible to discover. 334. At the beginning of June came the demise of the Pahlavi hat, and a month later the Meshed riots, for which the order prescribing European headgear provided at any rate the occasion. The actual cause may rather be found in the general discontent. The trouble started on the evening of the 10th July, the anniversary of the occasion when the Shrine was bombarded by the Russians, when a Shrine pensioner, named Sheikh Bahlul, preached an inflammatory sermon, demanding the redress of grievances and the lightening of the burden of taxation. The police were unable to disperse the crowd and on the following morning troops entered the Shrine. A fracas resulted, during which the troops were ordered to fire, but the General Officer Commanding, instead of completing the work of clearing the Shrine, then seemed to lose his head and withdrew the troops without even leaving pickets at the entrances. Vast crowds then poured into the Shrine and it eventually only became possible to disperse them three days later at whatis believed to be the cost of approximately 130 dead and nearly 300 wounded. Some 800 arrests were made, but Sheikh Bahlul himself escaped. 335. No other disturbances followed, but numerous reports reached His Majesty’s Legation of the unpopularity of the order introducing European head- gear, while more serious discontent seemed to be latent at Kermanshah and Tabriz. 336. The immediate consequence of the Meshed disturbances was the appointment of a new chief of police at that place to enquire into the origin of the trouble. By November he had succeeded in unearthing a ‘ ‘ plot ’ ’ of wide ramifications. Agha Zadeh, the chief Mujtahid, was arrested, some sixty or seventy mullahs were expelled from the province, and Assadi, the Mutawalli Bashi of the Shrine, was sent to Tehran, where he was later executed. 337. At about the same time the Prime Minister was forced to resign, though it remained uncertain whether his retirement was provoked by his supposed opposition to the Shah in the matter of the unveiling of women or by his connexion with Assadi, whose son had recently married his daughter and on whose behalf he is said to have intervened with His Majesty. 338. The year closed with insistent rumours of further arrests and of the forthcoming unveiling of women. (B) The Shah. 339. Apart from the customary visit to the Turcoman races in November and some short journeys of inspection to his properties in Mazanderan, His Majesty has remained at his capital throughout the year. the construction of a vast palace made of marble, specially brought from Yezd in commandeered transport, occupied some of the Royal leisure; a conspicuous tiled dome modelled on the famous dome of the mosque of Lutfullah at Isfahan is to surmount the edifice. His Majesty’s health appears to have been good throughout the year, though he appears older and whiter than before. 340. In July the Tehran newspapers reproached their confreres in Syria, Egypt and Turkey for publishing malicious and unfounded reports of a plot to murder the Shah and to overthrow the Government. (C) The Crown Prince. 341. His Highness the Crown Prince has continued to reside in Switzerland at the “ La Rosey ” School. By all reports, he appears to be developing satis factorily, and to take great interest in football and other sports. (D) Officials. (1) Cabinet. 342. Muhammad Ali Feroughi resigned without warning on the 3rd December, ostensibly for reasons of health. Mahmud Jam (Mudir-ul-Mulk) was appointed by the Shah to succeed him on the following day. The new Prune Minister then introduced the same Ministers to the Majlis as were previously in office, retaining the Ministry of the Interior for himself. (2) Governors-General and Goveimors. 343. The principal changes during the year were as follows :— Khuzistan .—Ibrahim Dadmarz was appointed Governor in June. Western Azerbaijan .—Muhammad Amery (formerly known as Sultan Muhammad Amery) was appointed Governor in March. . Baluchistan (otherwise known as Mukran).—General Mehdi Quh laj- Bakhsh was appointed Governor in January, his district including Zabul and Bushire and the Gulf Porte.—Amanullah Ardelan (Haji Izz-ul-Mamahk) was appointed in November 1935. [12998] E50 Kermanshah. —Muhammad Ali Rukni was appointed Governor in July. Luristan. —Abu’l Fath Doulatshahi was appointed Governor in November. Tehran. —Hassan Ali Kemal-Hedayat (Nasr-ul-Mulk) was appointed Governor of Tehran in October. (3) Diplomatic A ppointments A broad. 344. The following changes took place :— Stockholm. —Assad-Bahadur left for his post at Stockholm in January. Bucharest. —A Legation was opened at Bucharest during the year, the first occupant of the new post being Muhammad Ali Muqaddam (or Moghadem). He is understood to be accredited also to the Bulgarian, Greek, Yugoslav and Albanian Governments. Warsaw. —Muhammad Shayesteh was appointed Minister in September. Buenos Aires. —Nadir Arasteh was appointed the first Iranian Minister in September 1935; he is understood to represent Iran for all countries in Central and South America. Budapest. —Anushirvan Sepahbody presented his letters to the Regent in August. He is also accredited to Vienna, though he resides in Rome. Par 'is. —Abu’l Qasim Najm was appointed Minister in May 1935. Fazlullah Nabil was appointed Director of a new Iranian Information Bureau at Paris in September. Saudi Arabia. —On the departure of Muqaddam in September, Iranian interests in Saudi Arabia were dealt with by the Cairo Legation. Germany .—Mohsen Rais was appointed Minister in May 1935. Syria. —Hamid Sayyah remained consul-general at Beirut, but a new vice-consulate was opened during the year at Damascus, the first incumbent of that post being Mohsen Wafi. U.S.S.R. —Ali Reza Said-Ansari was appointed consul-general at Ashkabad in December 1935. Palestine. —A consulate was opened at Jerusalem in September 1935, the first occupant of the post being Hashem Mukarram-Nourzad. C hina.

Jalal-ud-Din Keyhan was appointed head of the First Political Department (which deals with Afghanistan, Turkey, Iraq, Egypt and Arabia) m succession to Djawad Sineky. '' 346. Fathullah Noury-Esfandiary was appointed director of the Treatv and League of Nations Section in place of Mohsen Rais. Section 7 ' Yadullah Azudi was a PP ointed head of the Passports and Nationality 348. Abdullah Entezam was appointed director of the Pars news-a^encv m succession to Fazlullah Nabil. &amp; J (5) Obituary. 349. During the year the only decease of importance from the British point of view was that of the former Prime Minister, Hassan Pirnia (Mushir-ud- Douleh), G.C.M.G. v (E) Majlis. 350. The tenth biennial legislative period of the Majlis began on the 6th June^ when the Shah opened the new Legislative Assembly with a speech in Wh V k t ? l a iv d ° n , the ^Provement of relations with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, turkey and the Soviet Government.51 351. Hussein Dadgar, formerly President of the Majlis, left very hurriedly for Europe shortly before the opening recorded above. In the absence of any official reference to the event it is impossible to be sure why he left; rumour says that he had allowed some of the Deputies to speak their minds too freely, an offence for which the Shah wished to imprison him, but was dissuaded by ‘ir’ Feroughi, who pointed out what a bad impression would be caused by the public disgrace of the man who signed most of the current laws of the country. 352. The new President of the Majlis was Hussein Esfandiary (Haji Muhtashin-us-Saltaneh). (F) Legislation. 353. The following list gives the principal laws passed by the Majlis during the year :— (1) Supplements to the Civil Code concerning nationality, domicile, marriage, divorce, &amp;c. (2) Law authorising the coinage of copper coins. (3) Law ratifying the postal agreements passed by the Postal Congress at Cairo. (4) Law providing for the increase of the capital of the National Bank. (5) Law authorising the payment to the Ministry of Roads and Communica tions of the sum of £200,000 from the reserve funds of the country. (6) Law authorising the preparation of regulations for the import of plant seeds and other agricultural products into the country. (7) Laws concerning the engagement of foreign instructors for schools, &amp;c.: three from Germany, two French, one biologist for veterinary services, six veterinary specialists and an official for the Mint. (G) Sheikh of Mohammerah. 354. The sheikh continued to live in Tehran during the year. No further progress was made with his claims against the Iranian Government. The latter are clearly waiting till he dies. His son Abdullah, who has consistently done everything in his power to oppose his father (without, however, refusing to accept the large monthly subvention which the sheikh pays all his offspring), excelled himself during the autumn by bringing a charge of imbecility against the sheikh in the local courts. The charge was refuted after examination. 355. The advance of 50,000 rupees made by the sheikh to the Government of India was repaid in March, against a receipt in which the sheikh waived all claims against His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and against the Government of India. (H) Miscellaneous. (1) Propagandist Activities of the Iranian Government. 356. The Pars Agency continues to function. It performs the double functions of supplying news concerning Iran to certain foreign news agencies and of disseminating whatever news it thinks suitable for publication in the local press. It is controlled by a section of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. No Iranian paper is allowed to publish news received direct from any foreign agency. 357. A press bureau was opened by the Iranian Government in Paris during the year. 358. The budget contains certain allotments for “ Special Expenditure,” which may conceivably be devoted to propaganda; no details of this expenditure are known. (2) The Press. 359. The press has continued to do what it was told. A special ‘ ‘ Political Department ’ ’ in the police continued to maintain a strict censorship on all matter which might possibly be considered to affect the prestige of Iran. [12998] E 2—V ' - 52 360. Zain-ul-Abedin Rahnema, editor of the Iran, and Sheikh Ali Dashti, proprietor of the Shafak-i-Surkh, were both disgraced at the time that Dadgar, the President of the Majlis, left the country in a hurry. It m said that both of these journalists were unwise enough to criticise the present regime. Ihe former was exiled to Beirut and the latter was allowed to retire to hospital under plea of ^ illness. 361. Abdul Muhammad Irani, the editor of the Cairo paper Chinreh-Namd, died during the year. The other important foreign newspaper in Persian, the Habl-ul-Matin of Calcutta, is believed to have continued publication though nothing remarkable has been heard of it. A new paper in Persian, named Iran-i-No (New Iran) appears to have been founded in Calcutta towards the end of the year, as an editorial in the Iran on the 1st December mentioned its existence and said, doubtless with reason, that as it was not controlled from Tehran it was doubtful whether it would be of any particular service to the country. 362. A new French paper, the Journal de Teheran, made its appearance during the course of the year. (3) Tribes and Security. 363. Apart from unrest in Kurdistan on the Iraq frontier, and more or less continuous trouble from some minor outlaws such as Abdul Hussein Khan of Remishk, there has been little to report of tribal unrest. Efforts have been made by the Governor of Iranian Baluchistan, General Taj-Baksh, to persuade the principal sardars to submit to the Central Government; but some of them, notably Jumeh Khan, do not seem to have agreed. The massacres at Meshed have no doubt had their effect on these semi-outlaws. 364. Plans for the settlement of the Bakhtiari and the Baluchi tribes in permanent towns have been actively pursued, though without much tangible result. The Lurs have been comparatively happy to draw regular wages as railway coolies; and a pretentious scheme for the foundation of a large capital of the province of Pusht-i-Kuh, named Ham, has been actively pursued. (4) Foreign Doctors and Midwives. 365. The task of obtaining licences for British doctors and midwives under the regulations issued in 1934 continued to occupy a disproportionate amount of the time of the Chancery of His Majesty’s Legation. But, though matters progressed slowly, only a very few cases were still outstanding at the end of the year. 366. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom agreed to the proposal of the Government of India that licence fees payable by I.M.S. doctors should be met out of official funds. The success obtained, however, in securing exemption from the regulations for the doctors employed by the Cables and Wireless (Limited), on condition that their practice was limited to the company’s employees, suggested that exemption might equally be secured for I.M.S. doctors, provided that their total length of stay did not exceed four months and that their attendance was confined to consular employees. A note on these lines was accordingly addressed to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in April, but it proved impossible to extract a reply before the end of the year. 367. Requests were made to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs at various times during the year that certain institutions in the Dominions should be added to the list of medical schools, &amp;c., whose diplomas were recognised by the Iranian Government. Despite many reminders, these requests remained unanswered. 368. The Iranian Government intimated in October that they could not issue a medical licence to Colonel J. C. Pyper, on the ground that 'he was His Majesty’s vice-consul at Zabul, and that they regarded it as wrong that a consular officer should exercise a second profession. After consideration of the matter, the Government of India agreed that an awkward situation might arise if a consular officer was to be sued in his capacity as a doctor by one of his patients, and they therefore decided that the present dual arrangement could not be continued. M. Motamedy was informed of this decision while he was in Delhi, and was asked only that the present system should be allowed to continue until other arrangements were made. Shortly afterwards the Ministry for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Legation that Colonel Pyper would be allowed to practice for a further three months. 369. It is to be noticed that, only a short while before, the Iranian Govern ment had issued a medical licence to Dr. Fazl Haq, His Majesty’s vice-consul at Birjand. (5) Salar-ud-Douleh. 370. This troublesome Qajar prince has been living at Alexandria during the year in a state of penury. The Foreign Office have been approached by his lawyers for “ compensation ” for the damages which his arrest by British troops at the end of the war and his arrest by the authorities in Iraq in 1926 gave rise. The lawyers indicated that failing this the Prince might wish to take legal proceedings and asked that His Majesty’s Government should appoint some official as a nominal defendant (an action against the Crown by petition of right being ruled out by the fact that no breach of contract can be alleged). It was explained to them that His Majesty’s Government could not possibly appoint a nominal defendant in this way and that the Prince must, if he wished, take proceedings against the various offices and officials whom he conceived to be responsible for his arrest and detention at various periods. (6) Nomenclature. 371. His Majesty’s Minister informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs early in the year that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom agreed to the Imperial Government’s request that the terms “ Iran ” and “ Iranian ’ should be used as from the 21st March instead of “ Persia ” and “ Persian ” (see paragraph 345 of the 1934 annual report). He pointed out, however, that some delay’must inevitably lapse before the change became generally known. In reply, M. Kazemi assured him that no precipitate action would be taken of a kind likely to interfere with normal communications. 372. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Imperial Bank of Persia both made the desired change in their title, and the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation adopted the designation “Mesopotamia Iran Corporation’’ for all their branches in Iran. 373. The names of a number of towns were changed during the course of the year, the most important change being that Mohammerah became Khorramshahr. 374. In general, active steps were taken by a newly-formed academy to purify the language of Arabic and other foreign words. IV.— Internal Affairs (Economic). (A)— Finance. (1) Budget 1935-36. 375. The budget for the Iranian year 1314 (ending the 21st March, 1936), was passed on the 6th March. The budget provides for a revenue of 751,123,487 rials (£11,555,000 at the rate of 65 rials to £ ruling at the time), and for expenditure of 750,827,790 rials (£11,550,200), the increase over the previous budget being about 130 million rials (£2,000,000). The principal increases in revenue estimates include 51 million rials (£784,600) from monopolies, of which 26,233,100 rials (£400,000) from the newly-formed cotton goods monopoly, and 51,000,000 rials (£784,600) from indirect taxation. 376. Increases on the expenditure side include 20,000,000 rials (£307,600) for the Ministry of War, bringing the figure up to about 250 million rials (£3,846.000) representing about 33 per cent, of the total (exclusive of the special credit of £2 million for the purchase of military supplies referred to below); 40 million rials (£615,000) for public industrial undertakings, 30 million rials (£461,000) for the capital of the grain stabilising company, 15 million rials (£23 o!oOO) for the capital of the National Insurance Company, and 20 million rials (£307,600) for road construction. [12998] e 3MMMMI 54 377. As usual the national budget does not include the following items: royalties received from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, revenue from the sugar and tea monopoly tax, and that part of the road tax which is devoted directly to road construction and maintenance. 378. A supplementary budget law was passed on the 13th March. The financial provisions of this law were : 300 million rials (£4,615,000) for railway construction; £2 million for military supplies; £25,000 credit to the Government; £600,000 as an advance to the Ministry of Roads and Communications for rail way construction and material; and £80,000 for payments due on sugar factories. From economies to be realised in the budget for 1314, 20 million rials (£30/,600) earmarked for expenditure in connexion with sugar factories, and 5,600,000 rials (£86,000) for expenditure in connexion with the cement factory. A sum of 30 million rials (£461,000) for equalisation of transport rates is to be provided for as follows : 10 million rials (£307,600) accruing from the motor vehicle monopoly; 15 million rials (£230,000) from profits made on purchase and sale of export certificates and 5 million rials (£76,900) from economies to be effected in the budget for 1314. 379 Other articles in the law affecting the motor trade, insurance, &amp;c., are dealt with in subsequent sections. (2) Taxation. 380. In October a law was passed revising the law voted in December 1934 (see paragraph 371 of the annual report for 1934), imposing a tax on paraffin and petrol Under the previous law the excise tax on oil products was 20 dinars (about 0 • 6 of a penny) per litre; by the new law paraffin and petrol pay 30 dinars (about 0-58 of a penny) and combustible fuel for engines 10 dinars (about 0-28 of a penny) per litre. The reason given for this measure was that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s new refinery near Kermanshah could supply the northern, eastern and other provinces of Iran with cheaper products owing to decreased transport expenses. The Government’s coffers could therefore benefit without undue pressure on the community. 381. In effect the cost of petrol was reduced and consumers benefited slightly; the price of paraffin, however, went up, so the poorer classes, as usual, are the principal sufferers. (3) Financial Situation. 382. No figures of actual revenue and expenditure were published during the year, and efforts to obtain information from the authorities were unsuccessful. 383. The following important items do not appear in the ordinary budget:— Million Revenue— Oil royalties and taxation in respect of rials. £. 1934 Sugar and tea monopoly tax 2,159,142 (estimated) ... 80 890,000 Road tax (estimated) ... Expenditure— 55 612,000 3,661,142 Vote for military supplies 2,000,000 Roads (estimated) 55 612,000 Railway ... 300 3,333,333 Railway voted ... • • • 800,000 Other sterling votes 205,000 6,950,33355 384. The amount of the national reserves held abroad is not known, but cannot now amount to very much. The heavy industrial and agricultural programme of the Government and extensive municipal construction, at a time when railway expenditure is at its highest point, must be straining the resources of the country to near breaking point, and a climax in the near future would appear to be inevitable. (4) Railway Finance. 385. For the year ending the 21st March, 1936, the following amounts were provided for by the supplementary law to the budget for the current year :— Million From the credit for economic institutions in the budget rials. for the previous year ... ... ... ... 30 From the sugar and tea monopoly tax ... ... ... 120 To be borrowed from the National Bank by the Ministry of Roads and Communications 150 300 Or, at 85 rials to the £, £3,750,000. The supplementary law also provided for an advance to the Ministry of Roads and Communications of £600,000, and on the 4th August a further advance of £200,000 was voted, both these advances to be paid out of the national reserves. It is unlikely that the revenue from the sugar and tea monopoly tax will be as much as 120 million rials, the receipts usually being in the neighbourhood of 100 million rials. The loan from the National Bank will presumably be paid out of the increased note issue. 386 No statement of the actual expenditure on the railway has been published this year. The estimated total cost of the line is not known, but will probablv be between £25 million and £30 million. 387. All the lots in the northern section (Shahi to Tehran) including the station at Tehran, which alone is estimated at £500,000, and the twelve lots in the south (Salehabad to Bahrein), have now been given out to contractors. Two of these latter lots, Nos. 6 and 7, were awarded to United Kingdom firms. Contracts for two new lots, covering about 56 miles south of Tehran towards Qum, have also been awarded. (5) Currency. 388. The order for the new bank-note issue (see paragraph 384 of 1934 report) was only placed towards the end of November. The order, worth about £125,000, went to a London firm. During the long drawn-out negotiations the shortage of notes, particularly of small values, as most of the silver coin had been either withdrawn from circulation or smuggled out of the country, necessitated small repeat orders from America. 389. On the 5th November the manager of the National Bank stated that the note circulation stood at 565 million rials (£6,278,000), and the reserves totalled 766,877,795 rials (£8,521,000). These reserves included the gold which was transferred to the bank’s capital in July, and also silver in London to the value of 37,388,911 rials (£416,000). 390. A shortage of small change was felt in spring when the high price of silver encouraged illicit exports of the local coinage, and the bank ceased issuing silver Copper coins of small value were minted and put into circulation. (6) Exchange. 391. Exchange during the year fluctuated considerably. From about 75 rials to the £ in January the rate dropped to just under 52 towards the end of April. This was due to the rising price of silver and the Banque Mellie’s efforts to keep the rate close to silver point in order to check the illigitimate, but [12998] e 456 highly lucrative, export of the metal, which was draining the country of its silver coin. Exporters of local products were losing heavily on their exports, and a law was passed authorising the Banque Mellie to change the price of export certificates : the buying price of the bank was raised from 9 per cent, to 25 per cent., and the selling price from 13^ per cent, to 30 per cent. These rates were reduced to 10 per cent, and 15 per cent, respectively in July when the rate went up to 80 rials to the £. After going up to 90 in August, the rate was kept stabilised at about 86 during September, October and November. In the middle of December the Banque Mellie, for unknown reasons, stopped selling foreign exchange; the rate shot up to over 97, and closed on the 31st December at about 92|. (7) Banque Mellie Iran {National Bank). 392. On the 4th July a Bill was submitted to the Majlis providing for an increase in the capital of the bank to 300 million rials, which, at the rate of the day, represented about £3,750,000. The measure was passed unanimously on the 9th July. The gold deposited at the bank by the Government, valued at 216,806,435-25 rials (about £2,710,000), was definitely transferred to the capital of the bank. A further sum of 1,193,564-75 rials, representing profits realised in previous years, was also added. These two sums and the paid up capital of 8 million rials now brought the paid up capital to 226 million rials, or just over £2,500,000, at the rate at the end of the year. 393. As stated in the section on currency, this gold is included in the reserves against the note issue. No balance sheet for the year ended the 21st March, 1935, had been published by the end of 1935, so it will probably be some time before it is known how this gold is made to serve a double purpose. 394. Towards the end of the year it was reported that several French financial experts were being engaged for the bank; one arrived at the end of the year and four others were following. It is understood that they are coming for the reorganisation of the bank. 395. An extraordinary general meeting was announced to take place on the 26th December; nothing has been published as to what happened. The ordinary general meeting was fixed for the 5th January, 1936, the agenda being :— (1) Discussion and passing of the accounts for 1313 (March 1934- March 1935). (2) To examine and approve the budget of the bank for the following two years. (3) To examine and approve the programme of the bank for 1314. (4) To elect “ Conseils Superieurs ” in accordance with the statutes. (5) Submission of the report on action taken up to date for the creation of the “ Bourse.” 396. The new premises of the bank will probably be completed early next year. (8) Agricultural and Industrial Bank. 397. A branch of this bank has been inaugurated at Kerman, and branches are to be opened at Kermanshah, Hamadan and Saoujboulagh (Azerbaijan). The bank has participated in the formation of several companies, which have been accorded the monopoly of dealing in the principal products of the country. It is also interested in the scheme for sinking artesian wells at various places for the improvement of the water supply for irrigation. (9) Insurance. 398. The budget for the current year made provision of 15 million rials (£166,666) for a State insurance company. The supplementary law to the budget provides for the organisation by the Agricultural Bank of a Real Estate Mortgage57 Company. Article 10 of the law requires all insurance companies in Iran to deposit a cash security. This security and C£ a part of the insurance premiums received in Iran ” must be converted into shares or bonds of the Real Estate Mortgage Company, and be deposited in the Agricultural Bank. 399. A note was addressed to the Iranian Government on the 3rd June pointing out that considerable objection would be taken to a requirement that deposits and part of premiums should be invested in bonds of the Land Mortgage Company. The reply, received on the 9th September, confirmed the intentions of the Government as laid down in article 10. 400. No land mortgage company has been formed, but the Bulletin of the Banque Mellie Iran, No. 6, dated October 1935, mentions the “ Banque d’Hypo- theque, dont la fondation est decidee, aura pour but d’accorder des credits a long terme pour des buts indetermines contre le nantissement des biens mobiliers, et qui emettra si 1’occasion s’en presente, des titres d’obligation a lots ou sans lots.” The capital of this bank, 20 million rials (£222,222), will be subscribed entirely by the Agricultural and Industrial Bank. 401. The insurance company, which has started operations, will no doubt obtain all Government insurance business. Foreign insurance companies have not yet been requested to comply with article 10 of the law; they appear to think that the measure will not be put into force. (B)— Trade. (1) Trade in General. 402. Trade was affected in the spring by the appreciation of the rial and the uncertainty of future rates of exchange. Transport rates were low owing to lack of movement of merchandise. The burden of heavy taxation, monopoly regulations and restrictions contributed to diminish activities. Under Govern ment auspices, companies were formed all over the country, to which were granted monopolies or facilities for trading. The small trader is being squeezed almost out of existence, especially as regards exports, most of the principal products being handled by monopoly companies. 403. Transport rates improved in the late summer, and towards the end of the year stood higher than they had been for a long time. The improvement was due to movement of industrial, railway and constructional material and also to the activities of the new oil refinery near Kermanshah. 404. According to approximate figures furnished by the Customs Administration, both imports and exports show increases over last year. Excluding exports of oil and of precious metals and coined silver and gold, the adverse balance is slightly less than last year. (2) Municipal Activity. 405. The progressive programme for town improvements continues, especially in Tehran. Many of the principal thoroughfares are now asphalted or paved. The electric current has been improved, and will be still better when the central power plant is completed. Palatial edifices are being erected; the Banque Mellie’s imposing new premises are nearing completion; the premises of several Ministries are being renovated; a bourse, an officers’ club, a national theatre, a museum, hospitals and schools also figure in the programme. Loans have been made by the Banque Mellie to municipalities of several provincial towns for reconstruction. (3) Balance of Trade (1934U35). 406. According to preliminary and approximate figures furnished by the Customs Administration, and the monthly bulletins of the Customs, the balance mm59 409. Imports of cotton piece-goods declined from 143,191,000 rials (£1,789,885) to about 133,100,000 rials (£1,783,465). Whilst the Soviet Union doubled the value of her imports last year, the United Kingdom, India and Japan all lost ground. The approximate figures of cotton goods imports were :— 1933-34- 1934-35. Rials. £000. Rials. £000 Soviet Union ... 36,632,000 455 73,030,000 978 Japan 65,371,000 812 41,190,000 552 United Kingdom 23,502,000 292 11,440,000 153 British India ... 10,932,000 136 5,100,000 68 410. Imports of cotton yarns practically ceased after the first six months of the economic year as a result of the prohibition. Imports only amounted to a little over 5-25 million rials (£70,350) of which India supplied about 4 million rials (£53,600). Last year, cotton yarns, of all counts, were imported to a value of over 20 million rials. Imports'of woollens also showed a decrease of about 3 million rials (£40,200); United Kingdom imports, however, were slightly more than last year; Belgium and France both lost ground considerably, while Italian imports were nearly doubled. The United States easily held the leading position in the motor trade, and the United Kingdom retained the second place. The Soviet Union, with increased imports of lorries, was placed third in the list. Imports of railway material amounted to a little over 4 million rials (£53,600). (6) Exports. 411. Exports, at 1,909,882,000 rials (£25,591,344) showed an increase of 92,626,000 (£3,002,686) over last year’s figures. . The Soviet Union took 202,911,000 rials (£2,718,893), the United Kingdom 696,537,000 rials (£9,333,204) and India 107,139,000 rials (£1,435,600). Exports to Japan amounted to 9,042,000 rials (£121,160). 412. There was a further fall in the value of exports of woollen carpets, the total in 1934-35 being about 113 million rials (£1,512,000), compared with 140 million (£1,748,910) last year. The bulk of these exports went to the United States, 43-3 million rials (£581,530); United Kingdom, 23-6 million rials (£316,230) and Turkey, 10-9 million (£146,050). 413. Exports of raw cotton amounted to about 26,000 tons, of which the Soviet Union took 17,800 tons, Germany 4,600 tons, Japan and India about 1,150 tons each. Exports of opium show a considerable increase over last year’s figures, due chiefly to the purchase of 1,001 cases by the Straits Settlements Government—the first purchase for the Straits since 1930. 414. Oil exports to the United Kingdom amount to 646,120,000 rials (£8,656,300) and to India 56,190,000 rials (£738,180). 7 (7) Soviet-Iranian Trading Relations. 415. At the invitation of the Soviet Trade Commissariat, a Persian mission, including the Directors-General of the Departments of Commerce and Agriculture, visited the Soviet Union at the end of April, and returned on the 24th May. According to the local press, the visit was a great success. Trading relations between the two countries improved, and on the 27th August a Soviet- Iranian Treaty of Establishment, Commerce and Navigation was signed at Tehran, to replace the treaty of 1931 which expired in June. 416. A list of imports from the Soviet Union was attached to the treaty : no quotas, however, were fixed for cotton piece-goods, sugar, matches and silk worm eggs, all of which commodities are handled by monopolies in Iran and are therefore governed by special arrangements. The quotas for oil products are greatly reduced owing to the expansion of the Anglo—Iranian Oil Company s distribution and sales organisations in Iran. 417. Trade between the two countries remains on the barter system, each country undertaking to purchase from the other certain specified goods. Soviet organisations may take part in any adjudications for installations and materials60 required for Iranian governmental institutions. An order for twenty-one silos was placed with the Soviet Union towards the end of the year; the construction ol these silos will be undertaken by the Kampsax Consortium on lines similar to their arrangement for railway construction. 418. No Soviet boats called at Persian Gulf ports during the year Sugar* piece-goods, matches, &amp;c., for Gulf ports were carried mostly by Greek boatsJ (8) Japanese Trading Activities. 419. There was a drop of over 28 million rials (£375,000) in the value of Japanese imports during the year ended the 21st June, 1935, as compared wi a the previous year. This was more than accounted for by decreases 24 million rials (£321,600) in imports of cotton piece-goods and about 7 nnlhon rials (£93,800) in imports of cotton yarns. Exports to Japan amounted to 9,537,630 rials (£127,799), as compared with 12-5 million rials (£152,890) last year. Exports consisted chiefly of opium, 3,026,000 rials (£40,550), raw cotton, 5,375,000 rials (£72,020) and gum tragacanth, 1,027,000 rials (£13,/60). 420. An arrangement was made for the export of opium to Japan against which Japanese cotton piece-goods were imported. 421. In August it was reported that the Japanese had purchased 300,000 tons of salt from the mines on Qishm Island, at about 45. a ton. The Japanese have imported machinery and explosives for working the mines, and a Japanese superviser will be stationed there. 422. The Osaka Shosen Kaisha (Osaka Mercantile Steamship Company (Limited)) of Dairen now run a monthly service to Iranian ports; during the year about twenty Japanese steamers called at Persian Gulf ports. ( 9 ) Italian Activities. 423. There is little to report on this subject. No further contracts for railway construction or, as far as is known, for any industrial enterprises were obtained by Italian companies. 424. Iran participated officially for the first time in the Levant Fair at Bari held in September. 425. Only four Italian steamers called at Gulf ports during the year. (10) German Activities. 426. In July an Iranian-German clearing scheme was proposed by the Iranian Government, and a delegation representing the Iranian Ministry ot Finance, Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Department of Commerce leit loi Germany at the end of July. On the 30th October an agreement concerning the regulation of payments between Germany and Iran was signed at Berlin. Payments must be made, in marks in Germany and rials in Iran, by means of clearing between the German clearing office and the Banque Mellie Iran, or through private barter accounts. 427. Certificates of origin will be issued instead of export certificates for Iranian goods shipped to Germany. Import licences would be issued for German o-oods on production of certificates of origin. This arrangement would appear to give German goods an advantage of about 18 per cent, over goods from other countries who still have to purchase export certificates in order to obtain import licences. The position was communicated to the Foreign Office on the 22nd December. 428. The Iranian Government decided in November to take part in the Leipzig Fair to be held in May 1936. 429. The principal imports from Germany were machinery, haberdashery, railway material, paper and ironware. Exports to Germany consisted chiefly of cotton, casings and dried fruit.61 (11) Belgian Activities. 430. The formation of an “Office d’Expansion Economique Belgo-Iranian ” in Belgium was announced in the Tehran press towards the end of November. The object of this concern is to encourage direct dealings between the two countries. M. Maurice Gondat, the director-general of the concern, arrived at Tehran at the end of December. According to the local press he will form in Iran a centre for economic and technical information regarding Belgian industry and commerce, and will especially study the question of starting a regular shipping line, flying the Belgian flag, between Antwerp and the Persian Gulf. 431. This development may be the result of the decision of the Iranian Government to participate in the Brussels Exhibition, which closely followed the publication in the press of suggestions to ship Iranian goods to Antwerp rather than to Hamburg. 432. Sugar, woollen goods, other textiles and a certain amount of railway material were the chief Belgian imports during the year 1934-35. Excluding oil, exports from Iran were meagre; cotton, dried fruit and furs were the principal goods taken. (12) British Empire Tariffs. (a) United Kingdom. 433. In November the Iranian Government presented a memorandum drawing the attention of Elis Majesty’s Government to increases which have been made since 1928 in the duties levied on the principal Iranian exports to the United Kingdom, i.e., dried fruits, red oxide and carpets. The receipt of the memorandum was acknowledged, and the matter was referred to His Majesty’s Government. (b) India. 434. In August verbal representations were made by the head of the English section of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, protesting against certain increases effected in the Indian Customs Tariff for 1935-36 on exports from Iran to India of unmanufactured tobacco, raw Iranian silk and carpets. The Government of India refuted the charge of infraction of the protocol annexed to article 2 of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty, in view of the fact that the articles mentioned could not be correctly described as ‘ ‘ the chief Persian articles of export ’ ’ as proved by statistics supplied, and the increases were merely protective and not discriminative. 435. Questions were also raised by the Iranian Government with regard to duties payable on exports of turquoises and wine from Iran. The matter was discussed at Delhi during the visit of the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs, when Mr. Caroe explained to Mr. Motamedy that, in the case of turquoises, their removal from the category of precious stones would not lead to any reduction of duties, and as now precious stones and articles not specifically mentioned in the tariff were also liable to a duty of 25 per cent., nothing therefore could be done. Similarly, duty on Iranian wine could not be decreased, as this would involve granting a preference to Iran. (13) Trade Monopoly Law. 436. Under directions from the Secretary of State a note was addressed to the Iranian Government by His Majesty’s Minister on the 31st May, drawing attention to the fact that the Foreign Trade Monopoly Law has now been in operation for some four years, and that article 4, paragraph 2, of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty of 1928 could no longer be regarded as a justification for its enforcement. For this reason His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India wished to place formally on record the view expressed orally and unofficially in the past to members of the Iranian Govern ment, that the provisions of the Foreign Trade Monopoly Law were incompatible with the provisions of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty. As was expected, the written reply received on the 19th September was negative.62 437. A second note was addressed at the same time regarding the monopoly of the trade in cotton piece-goods. No reply was received to this beyond the remarks of Mr. Soheily to His Majesty’s Minister, who presented both notes personally. 438. In March the law of July 1934, whereby the Government undertook tew***, buy all export certificates at a fixed price, was amended in order to allow the 1 * National Bank to modify the price from time to time should the fluctuation in exchange rates make it necessary. This measure followed a sharp appreciation of the rial on account of the rising price of silver, and assistance for exporters was necessary. The buying price for export certificates was raised from 9 per cent, to 25 per cent., and the selling price from 13| per cent, to 30 per cent. The prices were subsequently reduced to 10 per cent, and 15 per cent, when the rial was freed from following the silver point, and exchange was more or less left to find its own level. The rate for sterling went up from 52 rials to about 80 rials in about two months. 439. The import quota list for the economic year June 1935 to June 1936 (exclusive of imports from the Soviet Union), showed decreases in sugar, tea, spare parts for motor vehicles, groceries and preserves, and lubricating oils and greases. Imports of Soviet oil products were also curtailed owing to expansion of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s sales organisation in Iran. 440. No quotas for cotton piece-goods were published : all imports will continue to be effected under licences from the monopoly company. 441. On the 11th September the Department of Commerce published a notice whereby the department is authorised to monopolise the sale of prohibited goods and to require all owners of such goods to produce them for sale in certain centres under the control of the Government. The notice refers to artificial silk goods only. A charge of 3 per cent, on the sales is made by the selling centre, the Silk Share Company. 442. On the 3rd December a similar notice was published referring to certain natural silk goods : the charge on the sale of these would be 5 per cent. (14) Monopolies. 443. The supplementary law to the budget for the current year declared the import of automobiles a monopoly of the Government. The monopoly, however, has not been put into effect yet, and dealers can still import as previously. Monopolistic rights to deal in or to export various local products were granted during the year to companies recently formed with Government support: the Societe centrale, whose entire capital of 60 million rials (£66,666) is subscribed by the Ministry of Finance and the Agricultural Bank, is the most important. It controls all cotton, wool, skins, jute and rice, and has various subsidiary companies all over the country. 444. The monopoly of the export of assafoetida was granted to the “ Societe par Actions de FAssafoetida,” in which the Agricultural Bank has a financial interest. 445. The prices of cereals are controlled by the Societe pour la Stabilisation des Taux des Cereales. The Agricultural Bank has subscribed half the capital of 30 million rials (£333,333). 446. There is little left of importance except carpets, dried fruit and gum tragacanth: these may be monopolised in due course, leaving nothing for individual enterprise. (a) Cotton Piece-Goods. 447. In January the Societe par Actions des Cotonnades published a call for tenders for 20,000 bales of cotton goods. These were all supplied by the Japanese, who at the same time agreed to purchase 500 chests of Iranian opium. 448. A copy of the pro forma contract, which the societe requires importers to sign, was furnished to the Legation. Import licences will be granted by the societe to dealers on production of certificates of export, to the country which will63 supply the cotton goods, of the value of 50 per cent, of the import licence. A monopoly tax of 15 per cent.—subsequently doubled—and a 5 per cent, commission for the societe will he collected by the societe. 449. In March a circular was issued by the societe to the Legations with a view to forming relations with manufacturers of cotton goods abroad. In response two United Kingdom firms had communicated with the societe, but apparently no business resulted. The bulk of imports consisted of Soviet and Japanese goods sold by the Soviet and Japanese institutions established in Iran. 450. In October a British firm who had arranged for the shipment of 1,000 chests of opium on behalf of the Straits Settlements Government applied for permission to import British cotton piece-goods against the opium shipments. Arrangements, however, could only be made for the last 201 chests, the rest having been shipped and the relative export certificates disposed of before the application was made. 451. The societe showed great consideration and willingness to help, not only in this particular case but in general, where imports from the United Kingdom and India were concerned. Given competitive prices, there seems to be no doubt that these imports could be considerably increased, and much, if not all, ground lost could be recovered. (b) Silk and Cocoons. 452. The capital of the Silk Share Company was raised from 3 million to 6 million rials in July. A company for the improvement and development of the silk cocoon industry was formed, and a French expert, M. Anatole Ferran, has been engaged as technical manager. 453. Import licences for certain silk goods could, at the end of the year, be obtained from the Silk Share Company on payment of 5 per cent, commission and 15 per cent, to off-set the loss in exports of cocoons. The goods, however, can only be sold at the prohibited-goods selling centre. (c) Tobacco Monopoly. 454. The order for machinery required by the Tobacco Monopoly for a factory to be established in Tehran (see paragraph 431 of 1934 report) was obtained by a British firm in August. The value of the order was about £65,000. 455. i he contract for the construction of the premises will most probably be given to Skoda. (d) Red Oxide. 456. the Ministry of Finance granted a one year’s concession to Bahman Rashid Ghinwala (Irani) for shipments of red oxide to the Far East (including India) on an undertaking to export not less than 2,500 tons. Other purchases of the Hormuz red oxide were effected through the Ministry of Finance. Shipments reported during 1935 were :— To Philadelphia To United Kingdom To French ports To Bremen To India (in bags) T ons. 2,950 2,500 550 1,000 1,450 8,450 (e) Sugar. 457. Companies were formed at the principal towns for the handlino- of sugar under the control of the monopoly. The retail price of sugar was reduced from over 20 rials (4s. 5fi?.) to about 14 rials (3s. 1c?.) the batman of 6&gt;&gt; lb. towards the end of the year.64 (C )—Industry and Agriculture. (1) Industry: General. 458. The Department of Industries and Agriculture was divided into two separate Departments in January. - 459. Progress in the industrial development continued : several industrial companies were formed with the support of the Agricultural and Industrial Bank. Textile machinery for mills in various parts of the country was purchased. Orders were placed for the Tehran Central Power Plant, tobacco treating machinery, machinery for cement production, equipment for tea factories and more machinery for the jute factory at Besht. Two new sugar factories were completed, and the erection of two more was commenced. A tar factory and plant for creosoting railway sleepers were installed in Mazanderan. Tenders for equipment for the improvement of the existing coal mines were issued. (2) Textile Mills. 460. During the year orders were placed for textile mills at Kashan, 6,400 spindles; Ahwaz, 8,800 spindles; Isfahan, 6,688 spindles and 2,400 spindles (cotton thread); Meshed, 10,120 spindles; and an extension for the Shahi Mill, 9,856 ring spindles. Orders for all these were placed in the United Kingdom. Contracts for a mill at Shiraz with 6,000 spindles, and another at Qum with 5,000 spindles, were signed with German firms. A new textile mill was being erected at Kazvin. 461. Machinery to double the output of the jute factory at Resht was ordered from the original suppliers in England. 462. The silk spinning and weaving mill at Noeshahr (Deh Noe) was completed. (3) Sugar Factories. 463. The refineries at Shahabad (Kermanshah) and Mervdasht, near Shiraz, were completed and started production in the autumn. Two more are being erected at Meshed and Mianduab in Azerbaijan which should be ready to function next autumn. This will complete the six factories for which a contract was signed with Skoda early in 1933. 464. The cultivation of sugar cane in Khuzistan is being encouraged, and 190 tons of beetroot seed was purchased in Europe in order to increase and improve the crop. The last crop, though not large enough to feed all the factories up to capacity, was reported to be good and the percentage of sugar extracted satisfactory. (4) Match Factories. 465. The projected new factory at Tabriz (see paragraph 447 of 1934 report) was not approved by the authorities in view of the fact that the Khoyi factory had been granted the monopoly of Azerbaijan. The Khoyis, whose factory was badly damaged by hre in 1934, are endeavouring to obtain Government protection from Soviet competition by the prohibition of the import of matches from the Union. 466. Match factories have been installed at Hamadan, Isfahan and Shah- roud, the last one using locally made machines operated by hand. The factory at Zenjan has been enlarged. (5) Cement Factory. 467. The order for the extension of the cement factory has apparently not been given, as expected, to the Danish firm who equipped the existing factory. It is reported that the new machinery will come from Germany. (6) Tehran Electric Power Scheme. 468. The construction of the central station just outside the Doshan Tappeh Gate was started during the year.[12998] F 65 (7) Silos. 469. In accordance with the Irano-Soviet Treaty signed on the 27th August, the Iranian Government has placed an order with the Soviet Union for twenty- one silos. One for Tehran is to be of 65,000 tons capacity and the other twenty for various centres in the country will have capacities ranging from 8,000 to 16,000 tons. 470. The Iranian Government has given the contract for the erection of these silos to the Kampsax Consortium on terms similar to the contract for railway construction. It is expected that the silos will be erected within three years. (8) Agriculture. &gt; 471. Under the auspices and with support of the Agricultural Bank, several companies have been formed for the encouragement of agriculture. Agricultural schools have been opened at Rezaieh (Urumia) and Isfaham and a model farm at Ahwaz. A veterinary school has been added to the Agricultural College at Kerej. 472. A Bill was passed in April for the ceding of arable land belonging to the State in Khuzistan to cultivators who would exploit the land, to which end the Agricultural Bank would assist. Dams and barrages are being constructed to improve irrigation. 473. About 100 head of cattle and sheep were imported from France in spring for the improvement of meat, milk and wool and for cross-breeding. 474. Five German veterinary specialists have been engaged for the sanitary inspection of live-stock and for teaching in the veterinary school. 475. Trial plantations in semi-tropical regions in the south have been made in order to study the possibilities of acclimatising tropical trees and plants. Attempts are also being made to increase crops of sugar cane, cotton, flax and hemp. The latest public statistics of agricultural products (for 1933) give the following details :— Wheat Acreage under cultivation. Hectars. ... 1,614,925 Produce in 1,000 kilos. 1,868,392 Barley 626,029 744,900 Cotton 60,711 52,890 J ute 3,430 6,050 Opium 35,838 74,020 Tobacco ... 8,489 9,035 Rice 198,917 392,338 Tea 1,670 1.226 Beetroot ... 2,600 6,900 (9) Tea. 476 Sustained efforts are being made to increase and improve the tea plantations in Gilan and Mazanderan. Plant for drying tea is being importe through the Agricultural Bank. The contracts of four Chinese experts weie renewed, in 1934, for a further period of three years. V.—Opium. 477. According to statistics published by the Department of Agriculture and Industries, the latest estimates of the area under the poppy and produce of opium were :— Year 1311 (March 1931-March 1932): 32,732 hectares, 163,360 mans (1,062,840 lb.). Year 1312 (March 1932-March 1933) : 35,838 hectares, 156,736 mans (1,018,784 lb.). Up-to-date statistics are not available, but reports from individual areas imply an extension of cultivation, which had recently shown a declining tendency.478. Exports during the last three years were as follows (in cases of 160 lb.) :— Destination. Licensed— 1933. 19 3 ^ 1935. Macao 499 700 500 Dairen 150 200 Keelung 181 20 Amsterdam ... 100 Czechoslovakia 1 Hamburg 415 600 Marseilles ... 100 396 Singapore ... 1,001 Stockholm ... 1 London 30 130 Total licensed 830 1,346 2,848 Unlicensed ... 3,281 600 500 Grand total ... 4,111 1,946 3,348 479. The increase of exports to Europe is noticeable. Exports to the Far East were materially helped by 1,001 chests shipped by Messrs. Bellairs, Atkinson and Co. to Singapore for the Straits Settlements Government. Exports to Japan enable the Japanese cotton piece-goods institutions to import textiles up to double the value of the export certificates by arrangement with the Iranian Societe par Actions des Cotonnades. VI.— Communications. (A)— A viation. (1) Private Civil Flights. 480. As a result of the discussions which were started with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs at the end of 1934, the Iranian Government agreed early in 1935 to extend the period for which permission to fly across Iranian territory was valid from a week to a fortnight. They requested, however, that they should receive at least a week’s notice of intended flights. 481. Following further conversations, it was discovered that the Iranian Government would have no objection to permission for flights originating in the L nited Kingdom being obtained through the Iranian Legation in London, instead of, as formerly, through His Majesty’s Legation in Tehran. The Iranian Government had previously agreed in writing that permission for flights originating in India could be obtained through the Iranian consul-general at New Delhi. 482. The new procedure was adopted for most of the flights which took place during the latter part of the year and, as far as could be judged, appeared to be working satisfactorily. 483. Under the new arrangement pilots may apply for permission direct to the Iranian Legation in London, but they must at the same time supply full details of projected flights to the Air Ministry, who, in turn, undertake to keep His Majesty’s Legation and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf informed of all such flights. 484. During the year some thirty flights were made across Iranian territory by aircraft registered in the United Kingdom, India or the Dominions. (2) Iranian Civil Air Line. 485. The Government have ordered from the De Havilland Company three Rapides instead of the ten Dragons previously contemplated. In addition to ten pilots sent to the United Kingdom for a course of training, two more have left for special training on the Rapides.[12998] G 486. The service, starting with the Tehran-Bagdad line, will probably commence after Noeruz in 1936. 487. Provision for 1,299,900 rials (£14,450) for the purchase of aeroplanes and equipment necessary for establishing an air mail service was made in the budget for 1935-36. (B)— Railways. (1) Trans-Iranian Railway. 488. All the contracts on the northern and southern sections have been given out, as well as two lots on the Tehran-Qum section and the contract for the Tehran Station, the latter being valued at over £500,000. 489. The alignment between Bahrein (40 miles south of Burujird) and Tehran was changed with the approval of His Majesty the Shah. The line will not go to Burujird or Malayir, but will branch eastward from Bahrein up to Sultanabad, thence to Qum and Tehran. This will shorten the line by about 70 kilom. 490. The southern section is now working up to Ghaleh Sheikh, at kilo metre 307; in the north trains are running up to Pole Safid, at kilometre 175. 491. A new organisation has been formed under the title of “La Voie Ferree Gouvernementale de ITran ” for the exploitation of the State Railway. All receipts resulting from the operation of the railway will be paid into a special account at the Banque Mellie Iran, and expenses will be met by transfers from this account. (2) Port Construction. 492. The new port at Noe Shahr (Deh Noe) is taking form and construction is being urged on. The cost is estimated at about 60 million rials (£666,666). 493. The harbour of Bandar Shahpour is to be enlarged and improved to serve as a naval base as well as a commercial port at an estimated cost of over 100 million rials (£1,111,000). (C)— Roads. 494. The budget allotment for the Ministry of Roads and Communications for the year 1935-36 is 841,956 rials (£9,360) and a special subsidy of 20 million rials (£222,220) for road making is provided for. Based on the figures for the previous year, the revenue from the road tax may be estimated at about 55 million rials (£611,000). 495. The year 1935 has seen a large increase in the volume of road traffic, and the very rare interruption of road communication by flood and snow speaks very highly for the energy displayed by the Ministry concerned. The balance of expenditure on repair and construction seems to have been nicely maintained. 496. The following are the chief items of construction :— Construction completed— Resht-Khalkhal-Mianeh (reported as having reached the Gilan- Azerbaijan boundary by September). Bushire-Bandar Lingeh (400 miles traversable in a touring car in two days). Nain-Anarak (20 miles). Daragaz-Kuchan. Construction started— Isfahan-Ahwaz-via Shah Reza (Qumisheh) Janaki-Haft Khel and Arab Rashid. Shahr ud-Gurgan. Kerman-Joruft. Shahabad-Gawareh (Iraq frontier) via Simkan River-Kazerun- Behbehan-Ahwaz.VII.— Military Affairs. (A) The A rmy. (1) General. 497. The past year might seem to the Iranian General Staff one of brilliant achievement, and, to the casual onlooker, one, at least, of steady advancement. Conscripts are coming in, being trained and returned to their homes with regularity, and this cannot be without its effect either as propaganda or on the military spirit of the population. Schools of military education are widely distributed and functioning satisfactorily. An unprecedented amount of war material has poured into the arsenals. 498. The provincial garrisons, except in Baluchistan and Kurdistan, have remained on a peace footing and at liberty to devote their attention to training. In these two provinces the troops have at least held their own against the tribesmen and have inflicted as many casualties as they have suffered, and their refraining from the offensive is due probably to political reasons rather than to feelings of inferiority or to ineptitude. The real weakness of the Iranian army actually lies in what their General Staff would consider to be their chief strength, i.e., armament. They have neglected the elementary truth that nothing can take the place of training; they have allowed themselves to be dazzled by mere possessions; they have erected an imposing facade of guns for which there are no shells, of aeroplanes they cannot maintain, of vehicles they cannot drive, and of mechanical devices they cannot comprehend. A detailed appreciation—even were it possible to write one—of the value of the Iranian army as an instrument of war is outside the scope of this report, and their present situation may be sufficiently indicated by saying that their passion for purchase has exhausted their means of maintenance or by comparing them to an inexperienced and incompetent chauffeur placed in sole charge of a fleet of expensive motor cars of intricate design. (2) Expenditure. 499. The budget allotment for the Ministry of War for the Iranian year 1314 (the 22nd March, 1935, to the 21st March, 1936) is 223,729,980 rials (£2,796,624( 1 )), an increase of 20 million rials (£250,000( 1 )) over last year’s figures. This sum includes provision for the Navy and the Air Force for which no separate heads are shown. To this may be added 25,678,400 rials (£320,980( 1 )) for the road guards, 400,000 rials (£5,000( 1 )) for conscription expenses, 6 million rials (£75,000( 1 )) for the frontier guards. Thus the total military or semi military expenditure amounts to 255,808,380 rials (£3,197,604( 1 )), or, approxi mately, 34 per cent, of the national revenue. In addition, on the 13th March, a supplementary budget law was passed by the Majlis, granting to the Ministry of War credit for £2 million, with the proviso that the expenditure of this sum should not be limited to the current financial year. (3) Strength. 500. The strength of the Iranian army as estimated on the 1st June, 1935, was 87,049 of all ranks. This figure represents an increase of nearly 13,000 over the estimated strength for 1934. (4) Organisation. 501. The chief changes effected in organisation in 1935 are as follows :— (i) The increase in status of the Khuzistan Brigade to a division with headquarters at Ahwaz and the inclusion in that formation of the Luristan Brigade (headquarters at Khurramabad). * Note. —A conversion rate of 80-00 rials per £ sterling has been employed.69 (ii) The formation of a third division in Azerbaijan with headquarters at Ardebil. (iii) The renumbering of the 1st (Western) Azerbaijan Division as the 3rd. (iv) The renumbering of the 2nd (Eastern) Azerbaijan Division as the 4th. (v) The increase in status of the Ears Brigade (headquarters Shiraz) to a division to which the number 7 has been allotted. The troops in the Gulf Ports have been allotted to this division. (vi) The increase in status of the Senneh Brigade (headquarters Senneh) to a division. (vii) The increase in status of the Isfahan Regiment to a brigade. 502. In almost every case “ status ” is the only thing that has been enchanced by these changes. Since no Peace or War Establishments have been worked out there is no basis of calculation except a comparison with a unit of the Tehran garrison. As far as can be ascertained, no additional staff has been allotted. The ranks and, hence, presumably, the emoluments, of the commanders have not been increased and there is no reason why a platoon should not be designated an army corps if, by so doing, the Shah derives any sense of satisfaction. (5) Conscri'ption. 503. Conscription has been working smoothly and the quotas forthcoming from the various districts. The past year has seen an extension of conscription in the less remote parts of Kurdistan. (6) Manoeuvres. 504. Manoeuvres for the central garrison were carried out near Demavend village from the 29th September to the 1st October. Twenty-five aeroplanes took part. The Meshed division was out on manoeuvres from the 8th to 10th September. No mention of these was made in the press nor were any invitations to attend extended to foreign military attaches. (7) Reviews. 505. The usual military review was held on the 22nd February, the anniversary of the coup d’Etat. As the result of representations made by the Doyen of the Diplomatic Corps invitations to witness it were issued (for the first time since 1931) to the corps and to military attaches. As usual, the review consisted of two parts, a display at which boy scouts also performed and in which there were many events more redolent of the circus than the parade ground and the march past in which some 20,000 troops and 56 aeroplanes took part. Movements were carried out smartly, and the appearance and turn-out of both officers and men was creditable. (8) Military Education. 506. —(i) Five military schools of the secondary standard w r ere opened early in the year at Tabriz, Meshed, Isfahan, Shiraz and Kermanshah. (ii) One hour’s drill and physical training per week has been made compulsory for all senior boys in Government schools. The services of non commissioned officers are lent for this purpose. (iii) About half the French Military Mission are employed at the combined cadet college and junior officers school and half at the staff college. No plans have been made to add a senior officer’s school. (9) Changes in Nomenclature. 507. In the new movement to “ Iranianise ” the Persian language the army has not been overlooked. Most of the words for the various ranks have been changed and words supposedly “of pure Iranian extraction” substituted for those of Arabic origin. [12998] a 270 (10) Military Operations. 508. Isolated acts of brigandage are dealt with under the paragraphs devoted to security in another section of this report. The only two provinces in which troops have been on active service are Persian Baluchistan and ivurdis an though their actions in either of these areas hardly merit the desciiption o military operations and deserve no more than passing mention. Both areas lie on the frontier of Iran, both are mountainous and both contain a vinle lace ol nomadic tribesmen. In both areas smuggling and the Iranian Govemment s attempts to prevent it are the prime causes of the unrest, though Government s measures of conscription, disarming and settling are secondary causes. In both areas the Iranians claim that their enemies are drawing supplies of arms and ammunition from across the border. In both areas the past year has been characterised by military occupation (concentrated in Kurdistan and scatteied in Baluchistan) rather than offensive action. In both areas attempts have been made to negotiate with the tribes and a more conciliatory policy followed. At this point, however, the similarity ceases. In Baluchistan, the size of the affected area and its inaccessibility seem to have crippled the Government s offensi\e powers. In Kurdistan, on the other hand, the Iranian forces are admirably placed for executing parallel £ drives into the heart of the tribesmen s habitat and, given Iraqi co-operation, could clean up this area in a campaign of three months duration. The reason underlying their inactivity is a political one and they now hope by conciliatory measures to win over to their side of the border the not inconsiderable number of nomadic Kurds who, for the past few years, have preferred Iraqi sovereignty to that of Iran. (H) Travellers—British Officers. 509. The following officers visited Iran during 1935 Group Captain R. E. Saul, D.F.C. Royal Air Force. Major J. A. Codrington, Coldstream Guards. Major H. J. Underwood, l/15th Punjab Regiment. Bt.-Major G. H. B. Wood, Royal Deccan Horse. Captain G. R. Mockler, Royal Artillery. Captain S. T. Apcar, Army Remount Department. Lieutenant E. J. C. Chaytor, Royal Artillery. Lieutenant W. F. Kemble, Royal Artillery. Lieutenant L. D. M. Patterson, Royal Corps of Signals. Lieutenant T. A. K. Hickman, 13/'l8th Hussars. (12) Language Study Officers. 510. Lieutenant W. M. T. Magan, Sam Browne’s Cavalry (12th Frontier Force) arrived in Shiraz on the 15th March, 1935, for a twelve months’ course of study of Persian. (13) Travellers—Foreign Military Officers. 511. The following visited Iran during 1935 :— Colonel Hata, Japanese military attach^ in Moscow. Major M. Nito, Japanese military attach^ in Kabul. (14) Foreign Military Missions. 512. The strength of the French military mission has increased to fifteen officers. The senior officer is General Gendre. Colonel Royer, one of the senior officers, recently did an attachment in the Aldershot Command. (15) Colleagues. 513. Chef d’Escadron Raymond David, French military attache since 1930, died on the 2nd September. The death of this popular officer is to be deplored. He maintained the closest liaison with two successive British military attaches. No announcement as to his successor had been made up to the end of the year. There have been no changes among the remaining foreign military attaches.71 1 r (B) The Air Force. (i) Strength in Machines. 514. During the year the orders previously placed with the Hawker Engineering Company for machines of the ££ Audax ” and ££ Fury ” types, and with the De Havilland Aircraft Company for the D.H. cc Tiger-Moth ” type, have been completed, so that the total number of aeroplanes in possession of the Iranian air force numbers 146. The description of these machines is as under : A ir craft. De Havilland “Tiger-Moth” De Havilland “Tiger-Moth” De Havilland 9 Hawker ‘ ‘ Audax Hawker “ Fury ” Hawker ‘ £ Audax Junkers R. 5 Engine. “Gipsy-III” ... “ Gipsy-Maior ” £C Liberty” Pratt and Whitney Bristol £ £ Mercury ’ Bristol “Pegasus” “B.M.W.” “ B.M.W.” Hornet Number. 33 18 6 29 20 28 2 10 (2) Casualties. 515. Of the many accidents to aircraft during the year, the most serious occurred on the 12th February when fourteen D.H. “ Tiger-Moth ” aeroplanes were practising formation-flying over the Qila Murgha military aerodrome. Two machines collided at a height of about 200 feet and crashed, one pilot being killed, the other seriously injured. Both machines were damaged beyond repair and were written off. All these machines were being flown by pupils, the majority of whom had only received fifteen hours’ flying instruction. (3) New Orders. 516. Orders have been placed with the De Havilland Aircraft Company for ten machines of the “ Tiger-Moth ” type, fitted with Gipsy-Major engines, and for three machines of the “ Rapide ” type, fitted with “ Gipsy-six engines. These latter are intended for the Iranian air mail service, and will cost approximately £12,000. Spares have also been ordered to the \alue of approximately £3,000. In addition, orders have been placed with the Hawker Engineering Company for spares to the value of approximately £25,000. (4) Factories. 517. The aircraft factory now under construction (at Doshanteppeh, 3 miles south-east of Tehran) is expected to be ready early in 1936. About 60 pei cent, of the necessary machinery has arrived and is being installed. The personnel employed is as follows :— British Italian ... Iranian air force officers Iranian air force mechanics Iranian civilians . Conscripts... 10 1 4 4 14 20 It is reported that a further eighty civilian mechanics will be engaged when the factory is complete. The proposed annual output is said to be five complete Hawker airframes, five complete De Havilland airframes and all repairs and overhauls. (5) Aerodromes. 518.—(i) The Boulton and Paul hangar at Ahwaz has been erected, and a branch railway line laid thereto. (ii) A new aerodrome has been constructed at Tabriz.r Mi 72 (6) Educational Establishments. 519. A school for cadets has been opened at Tabriz. Presumably a school will be started in Meshed also. (7) Organisation. 520. Two squadrons, each consisting of seven “Audax,” seven “Fury” and two “ Tiger-Moth ” machines, are to be located at Tabriz and Meshed respectively. (8) Parades and Manoeuvres. 521. Air manoeuvres were held by the Iranian air force on the 26th November. His Imperial Majesty the Shah wms present and expressed satisfaction at the manner in which the manoeuvres were carried out. All ranks were granted three days’ leave. No invitations to witness these manoeuvres were issued to foreign military attaches. 522. During the review held on the 22nd February some fifty-six machines of the “Fury,” “Tiger-Moth' and “ Audax ” types flew in formation, arriving from the East and passing over the saluting base. Four machines returned and performed evolutions in the air. (9) British Mechanics. 523. The British mechanics employed by the Iranian Government for service with the Iranian air force have, in the past, experienced much difficulty in obtaining their salary when it became due. In several instances it has been ten days overdue. Representations were made direct by the men concerned to the General Officer Commanding, and satisfaction was obtained. (10) Foreign Air Missions. 524. Early in the year the Belgian Minister reported that His Imperial Majesty the Shah, in the course of an audience, had expressed his satisfaction at the efficiency with which the Belgian advisers and instructors were carrying out their duties (they number one colonel, one major and six warrant-officer instructors). Later in the year the Minister hinted that the French were intriguing against the Belgian air mission, and said that he had instructed Colonel Bever to avoid any “ incidents,” to be as obliging as possible and to ensure the continuance of the mission at whatever cost in efficiency and self-respect. 525. As far as the colonel is concerned, these instructions are being carried out to the letter. 526. More recently there is evidence to show that the Belgian mission has been actively engaged in discrediting the Hawker products and attempting to prevent further orders from this firm and to secure orders for “ Fairey ” aircraft made under licence in Belgium. 527. They were able to profit by complaints (some of which were justifiable) made by the Iranians themselves about the unreliability of the Hawker machines. 528. It is true that the propellers have proved unsatisfactory, but there are other causes (such as a paucity of spares and an insufficiency of mechanics) the blame for which can in no way be laid at the company’s door. One of the company’s test pilots has arrived in Tehran and is engaged in rectifying the defects. (C) The Navy. (1) Naval -Exercises. 529. In May, the sloops Babr, Palang and the smaller sloops Simurgh, Karkas and Shahrukh assembled at Bushire and steamed to Kharg Island, where they practised naval manoeuvres and gunnery. (2) Establishment of Naval Posts. 530. In May, the Palang visited Hen jam and Basidu and established small naval posts of a petty officer and twelve men at each of these places. \ 173 } (3) Refairs. 531. The Simurgh spent three weeks in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s dry dock at Abadan in June. The Babr and Palang left Khorramshahr on the 19th January for Bombay for dry docking, and returned on the 27th March. 532. The Iranian Government has again asked for dry docking facilities for the Babr and Palang early in 1936. (4) New Vessels. 533. One tug (the Niru) and two fuelling barges arrived from Italy in June. 534. Five Italian mechanics arrived in Pahlevi to assemble the four coastal motor patrol boats which had been sent overland in cases from Bandar Shahpur. The Deh Nau was launched on the 24th December, and another (the Shahsowar) is reported to be ready. The new floating dry dock on order from Italy had not arrived by the end of the year. (5) Personnel. 535. The contract of the Italian wireless operators and mechanics having expired in July, they left for Italy. (6) Works. 536. The five naval jetties on the left bank of the Karun opposite the naval barracks and offices have been completed. (D) The Gendarmerie. 537. This force has continued to work satisfactorily during 1935. The strengthening of military garrisons in affected areas and the raising of frontier guards for preventive duties have lessened a constant source of casualties to the gendarmerie. The only increase of strength believed to have occurred is the raising of an extra battalion in Mekran.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT Printed for the use of the Foreign Office.

DURING 1936 Iran continued to follow the path marked out during earlier years by the Shah. Work on the railway, the most grandiose outward sign of His Majesty’s policy of modernisation, continued steadily, and it is believed that the line will be finished in advance of the due date. The erection of factories and the policy of instituting monopoly companies in numerous branches of trade were pressed forward. Public order remained good. But it cannot be said that any improvement took place in the lot of the vast majority of the people. Taxation remains very heavy, and it is too soon for the ambitious programme of public works to produce any dividend in the form of an improved standard of living. 2. During the year it became steadily more difficult for the Iranian Govern ment to finance at the same time the railway, heavy importations of railway supplies and the operations of the monopoly companies. The supply of foreign exchange, which in March was subjected to the control of a Government Commission, became[15259] b 2 steadily less, and at the end of the year a position had been reached in which some modification of policy seemed almost inevitable. 3. The main feature of the year’s social legislation was the abolition of the veil. This was effected in somewhat ruthless fashion, but as far as can be judged the original violence of feeling caused by this reform had largely disappeared by the end of the year. 4. In foreign affairs, no developments of first-rate importance fall to be recorded. The negotiations over the Shatt-el-Arab continued, but without result. They were resumed with, on the Iranian side, some hopes of success, when the change of Government in Iraq in October led to the disappearance from the scene of Yasin Pasha. The close relations of Iran with Turkey and Afghanistan were emphasised by the cordial attentions paid to the Afghan Minister of War during his visit to Tehran in November, and by the visit to Iran of a Turkish delegation under M. Cemal Husnu, which arrived at Tehran in October to conclude a series of agreements with the Iranian Government. The mission was still here at the end of the year. II. —Foreign Relations. (A) United Kingdom and India. (1) General. 5. No negotiations for a general treaty took place during the year under review, and the major outstanding questions were, indeed, barely mentioned. In January the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Flis Majesty s Minister that he wished to have a conversation with him before his departure on leave in regard to the possible settlement of all questions still outstanding between the United Kingdom and Iran. He mentioned the demarcation of the Baluchistan frontier, Bahrein and the islands in the Gulf as subjects which he would like to discuss, but added that there were really no serious outstanding difficulties, and that he thought the moment had arrived to clear everything up. M. Kazemi did not, however, pursue the matter further, being possibly put off by Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen’s refusal to sign his suggested &lt;£ gentleman’s agreement ” (see section on Iraq), and Sir Hughe departed on leave at the end of the month without having obtained any fresh statement of the Iranian standpoint. 6. Thereafter the subject was never mentioned, and the only indication that the Iranians still had the idea of negotiations in mind was given by M. Soheily during the course of an informal conversation in the autumn with the counsellor to His Majesty’s Legation, when he informed him that the Shah had designated him to replace M. Ala in London. M. Soheily then said that he had considerable misgivings about going to London, as the Shah had made it clear that he expected a good deal from him there, adding that the Shah had in mind certain questions in°the Gulf. M. Soheily was vague in his remarks, but he made an allusion to certain islands and specifically mentioned Tamb. 7. Apart from the question of the Irano-Iraqi dispute, the matters with which His Majesty’s Legation were called upon to deal were accordingly all more or less of a minor nature. In the Gulf the year was uneventful, and it is noteworthy that there is nothing whatever to record about such hardy annuals as the Arms Traffic question, Abu Musa and (with the exception of M. Soheily’s passing remark) Tamb. In East Iran it was possible to note a considerable improvement in the attitude of the authorities towards British subjects, thanks to the vigorous representations of Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, who made it abundantly clear to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs before his departure on leave that a most serious impression was being created by the continued failure of the Iranian Government to remove the very legitimate grievances under which British subjects in that part of the country were suffering. These representations only bore fruit after Sir Hughe’s departure, but the Iranian Government then went a long way towards settling all outstanding questions. In general it may be said that, though a number of new questions unfortunately, though probably inevitably, arose during the course of the year, a greater number of old ones were settled, and the balance sheet at the end of the year showed a distinctly healthier tendency.4 8. In general a friendlier tone seems to have been adopted towards the British, at any rate in Tehran. His Majesty’s Legation were given many proofs of sympathy at the time of the death of His Majesty King George V. The Shah ordered that the flags on Government buildings should be flown at half-mast for three days, and all the Ministers and leading officials attended the memorial service. Reports from His Majesty’s consular officers indicated that a similar feeling of friendly and respectful sympathy existed throughout the country, the only jarring note being struck by the officials at Kerman, where the Governor- General did not call at His Majesty’s consulate to express his condolences, and where all non-officials who did call were sent for by the police next day to answer for their conduct. Not content with this, the police took the names of all Iranians who attended the memorial service. 9. Such shocking behaviour, though fortunately an isolated instance, serves, nevertheless, to draw attention to the fact that, though Anglo-Iranian relations in the year under review were “ calmes,” they cannot be described as “ confiantes ” (to quote the two adjectives which the Minister for Foreign Affairs once used in conversation to describe Irano-Russian relations). Thus, though it became possible for members of His Majesty’s Legation to widen their social contacts with Iranians, there was by no means a corresponding move towards greater freedom in most provincial centres, and many of His Majesty’s consular officers remained in a position of being shunned like the plague by all non-officials and boycotted by the officials on all except strictly official occasions. 10. Another illustration of the fact that the ice was still thin was afforded by the ready, almost eager, manner in which the Iranian Government on a number of occasions made vigorous complaints about what were in themselves trivial incidents. A misunderstanding between a captain of one of His Majesty’s ships and Colonel Bayendor, the Commander of the Iranian Navy, about an exchange of calls, a trifling incident on board a merchant-vessel at Abadan, accusations that British aeroplanes had flown over Iranian territory without having obtained prior permission to do so, the unfortunate incident of the departing Iranian consul at Bombay, all these were taken up by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in vehement terms. And to descend to the ridiculous, complaints were even made by the Ministry that the firemen of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company gave a military salute and that the crew of the vice-consulate launch at Khorramshahr wore uniforms of a type that is worn in colonies (be it noted that Europeans in Tehran have been asked not to wear short white coats when dining with Iranian officials in the summer, as they are regarded as “colonial ”). 11. To sum up the above in a brief conclusion : The vigorous representations of Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen with regard to the unsatisfactory treatment of British subjects, and more especially Indians, by the military, police and customs authorities undoubtedly had their effect. A number of grievances were remedied during the course of the year; there was a relative lack of new causes of friction, and the general atmosphere sensibly improved. The big issues were allowed to remain dormant, and even when His Majesty’s new Minister arrived in Tehran in October, the Minister for Foreign Affairs showed no disposition to raise with him any large question other than that of the Shatt-el-Arab. Nevertheless, the Shah was apparently preparing to send M. Soheily to London in the hope that he would obtain some success in Gulf matters, and it remained throughout the vear strictly necessary to remember that the old cloud of suspicion of British intentions still hung in the air and that the sensitiveness and susceptibilities of the Iranians were still such that, though an inch might have been gained, it would at no stage have needed much to make us lose an ell. (2) Persian Gulf. (a) Iranian Regulations regarding the Visits of Foreign Warships. 12. Agreement was reached with the Iranian Government early in the year with regard to the application to the Persian Gulf Division of the Royal Navy of the Iranian regulations concerning the visits of foreign warships, the chief point of difference outstanding at the beginning of the year was that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom desired that only local notification should be given when one of His Majesty’s ships desired to visit Abadan for the5 [15259] b 3 i sole purpose of fuelling; whereas the Iranian Government maintained that notification of all visits should be made eight days in advance in Tehran. His Majesty’s Legation were fortunately put in possession of a valuable argument in January when the Iranian Government requested that docking and repair facilities should be given at Bombay to the Iranian sloops Babr and Palang, since though it was decided not to link the two questions too closely, His Majesty’s Legation were authorised to point out to the Iranian Government that, while docking facilities would readily be granted, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had been disagreeably impressed by the contrast between the readiness of the Iranian Government to assume that the Government of India would at any time grant valuable privileges at Bombay and their unwillingness to make a trifling concession to His Majesty’s ships. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom further naturally expected that, now that docking facilities were being granted to the Iranian navy, the Iranian Government would deal with the question of the visits of His Majesty’s ships in as accommodating a spirit as possible. 13. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs were clearly much relieved when they learned that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had decided not to make the grant of facilities at Bombay conditional on obtaining their desiderata over visits by His Majesty’s ships to Abadan; and they then tackled the Ministry of War with such good effect that the latter were persuaded to agree that, if one of His Majesty’s ships desired to visit Abadan urgently for the sole purpose of taking in fuel, it would be sufficient notification if His Majesty’s vice-consul at Khorramshahr informed the Governor of Abadan twenty-four hours in advance. It was further agreed that, in the event of such a visit, no calls would be exchanged, no officer or member of the ship’s company would be landed, and the ship would cast off as soon as she had taken in fuel. The Iranian Government unfortunately refused to agree to the other main request put forward by His Majesty’s Legation, namely, that when notification of an ordinary visit was made in Tehran, the local authorities should simultaneously be informed direct by the nearest British consular officer; and that it should be understood that the latter, in the absence of any communication from the Iranian Government, would then raise no objection to the visit. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs stated that they feared that this suggestion might lead to practical difficulties in ports where there was no British consular officer, and they also felt that the procedure proposed would inevitably lead in time to the supposition that local notification could replace the notification through the diplomatic channel. The Iranian Government was, how ever, prepared to give a categorical assurance that the necessary instructions would always be sent with the utmost promptitude to the local officials concerned. The Iranian Government, in agreeing to make the desired concession at Abadan, stipulated that in all other respects His Majesty’s ships should abide by the regulations, and proposed that the new arrangements should come into force at No Ruz (21st March). 14. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were able to accept these proposals, though their acceptance was so worded as not to commit them to agreeing to one or two clauses in the regulations which they considered to be contrary to international law and practice; and on the whole it may be said that the new system worked well during the remainder of the year. One or two muddles arose during the first few weeks, either because the local authorities received obscurely worded instructions from Tehran or because they did not properly understand the regulations; and a number of points were discovered on which the regulations were either silent or obscure and which had to be cleared up by correspondence with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Nearly all these questions were settled smoothly enough, however, and the following incident was the only one which even threatened to have serious consequences. 15. H.M.S. Bideford visited Abadan on the 14th November, and two days later the Ministry for Foreign Affairs complained orally that Captain Wadham had objected to paying a call on Colonel Bayendor in accordance with the regula tions, giving as his reason the fact that the waters of the Shatt-el-Arab, off Abadan, were not under Iranian sovereignty. The Ministry pointed out that any argument which touched the sovereignty of the waters off Abadan raised an issue of first-class importance to the Iranian Government, and requested that a full enquiry might be made into the matter. It soon became apparent, however,from information received from the senior naval officer and His a ^ eS f&gt;^ vice-consul at Khorramshahr that the incident was solely the produc o a misunderstanding. It was Captain Wadham’s first visit to Abadan, did not appreciate that it was expected of him that he should call on o o Bayendor in the neighbouring port of Khorramshahr; moreover, Khorramshahr and Abadan were now regarded as one administrative is ric , this reorganisation had only taken effect two or three weeks previous y an was not generally known. The misunderstanding was further increased by tne tact that Captain Wadham had understood the Iranian naval officer, who came on board to greet him on arrival, to say that Colonel Bayendor would call on im, with the result that he was awaiting Colonel Bayendor at the same hour as Colonel Bayendor was awaiting him. Lastly, His Majesty’s vice-consul, who would probably have been able to clear up the misunderstanding straight away, was unfortunately ill in hospital. It was also quite clear that the only person who had made any reference to the question of the sovereignty over the waters o Abadan was Colonel Bayendor himself, and that this issue had not been taken up by anyone on the British side. 16. These facts were explained orally to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and at the latter’s request they were then recorded in an aide-memoire tor submission to the Shah, as it had apparently been on His Majesty s orders that the question had first been raised. It was pointed out in this aide-memone that much of the difficulty arose from the fact that the Iranian regulations did not lay down the manner in which calls between the captain of a visiting warship and the local officials were to be arranged. Previously this had been done through one of His Majesty’s consular officers, but on the entry into force of the new regula tions the local officials in one or two ports had maintained that this procedure was not consonant with the regulations, and requests by His Majesty s Legation to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs for information as to how they desired such calls to be arranged had remained unanswered. 17. No reply had been received to this aide-memoire by the end of the year, but the Ministry for Foreign Affairs seemed confident that the incident could be regarded as closed and promised to give sympathetic consideration to His Majesty’s Legation’s request that, in order that future misunderstandings should be avoided, calls should once more be arranged through His Majesty’s consular officer in the port concerned. 18. A lesser complaint from the Iranian Government, which was received during the course of the summer, related to the fact that the troopship Dorsetshire had called at Abadan and taken in fuel without any previous notification having been addressed to the local authorities. It was later explained to the Iranian Government on the instructions of the Foreign Office that the visits of troop ships had never been notified to them in the past, and that it had not been appreciated that they desired that the Iranian regulations should be applied to troopships as well'as to warships. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would, however, have no objection to complying with the wishes of the Iranian Government in this respect, and they had accordingly issued all necessary instructions for the future. 19. The Iranian Government unfortunately proved most unaccommodating in regard to another matter arising out of the regulations which His Majesty’s Legation had to refer to them. It was observed that the regulations made no provision for the waiving of the usual formalities to permit the landing of members of a ship’s crew in an Iranian port in the event of serious illness or accident, and when His Majesty’s Legation requested that the local authorities in Iranian ports should be instructed to give all possible facilities in the event of such emergency the Ministry for Foreign Affairs replied that His Majesty’s ships carried doctors and medical equipment, and that, if hospital treatment on shore proved necessary, this could always be foreseen some days in advance. His Majesty’s Legation were instructed to return to the charge, and it was pointed out to the Iranian Government both that their reasoning was unsound and that it was undoubtedly international practice to waive the usual formalities in case of urgent need. It became clear, however, that this was one of those cases where the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, though themselves sympathetic, were having great difficulty with the Ministry of War, and despite pressure by His Majesty’s Legation it had not proved possible to extract a reply by the end of the year.7 [15259] B 4 20. Agreement was reached with the Iranian Government during the course of the year over the scale of naval salutes laid down in the Iranian regulations (see paragraphs 63 to 65 of the annual report for 1935). During the previous year they had argued that, though no rank corresponding to commodore or to the French equivalent of “ capitaine de vaisseau, chef de division” existed in the Iranian navy, an officer of the rank of “sarhang” (generally translated as “ colonel ”) who commanded a naval division should be accorded a salute of eleven guns. His Majesty’s Legation were instructed to revert to the matter with the Iranian Government early in 1936, and after prolonged and involved correspondence the latter agreed in November that a salute of eleven guns should only be accorded to an officer who held the rank of “ capitaine de vaisseau, chef de division,” adding that such a rank did not exist in the Iranian navy. (b) Naval Visits to Iranian Ports. 21. H.M.S. Norfolk, flying the flag of Vice-Admiral the Hon. Sir Alexander Ramsay, K.C.V.O., C.B., D.S.O., Commander-in-chief, East Indies Squadron, carried out a cruise in the Persian Gulf in October and November, visiting, amongst other ports, Abadan and Bushire. 22. A number of unofficial visits to Iranian ports were carried out by His Majesty’s ships of the Persian Gulf Division during the course of the year. The only visit that was in any way out of the ordinary was that paid by H.M.S. Bide ford to Henjam, Basidu and Task in September (see section II (A) (2) (&lt;7) below). (c) Iranian Naval Activity. 23. A note was received from theMinistry for Foreign Affairs early in January requesting that repair facilities might be accorded to the Iranian warships Babr and Palang at Bombay as in previous years. As the Iranian Government were at that time being obstructive about giving special facilities for His Majesty’s ships to visit Abadan to take in fuel, the question was discussed whether it might not be advantageous to make the granting of the Iranian Government’s request conditional on accepting the desiderata of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom over visits to Abadan. It was decided, however, not to make the two questions interdependent (see paragraph 12 above), and the Iranian Govern ment were informed early in February that the desired facilities at Bombay would readily be accorded. Babr and Palang accordingly left Bushire for India at the end of the month. 24. The floating dry dock ordered from Italy reached the Persian Gulf in May and was moored at Bandar Shahpur with the assistance of tugs and a floating crane belonging to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. It is likely that the choice of Bandar Shahpur was partly dictated by the fact that the dock was too large to be moored in the Karun, where preparations were at one time being made for its installation. (d) Steamship Treherbert Incident at Abadan. 25. A tiresome, though in itself trivial, incident occurred at Abadan on the 16th July, when the steamship Treherbert was unloading and a British sailor struck an Iranian tally clerk who went into a part of the ship where he was forbidden to go and refused to leave when asked to do so. The clerk complained to the police, who took up the case after some delay and requested the captain to hand over the sailor. This the captain was unwilling to do, and after a good deal of further discussion he sailed for Basra on the 23rd July without his clearance papers, stating that he could not delay any longer. 26. In the middle of August a strong complaint about the captain’s conduct was received from the Iranian Government, who stated that it had been decided that neither the ship nor captain would be allowed to enter Iranian waters again. On the instructions of the Foreign Office an attempt was later made by His Majesty’s Legation to persuade the Iranian Government to lift the ban on the grounds that the incident was in itself of very little importance, and that the action taken by the Iranian Government seemed somewhat harsh, even though the captain had admittedly acted in a foolish and ill-advised manner. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs insisted, however, on treating the incident most seriously, and even hinted that it might be pursued further. They could in any case hold outno hope that the ban on the captain or the ship would be lifted. His Majesty s Legation therefore felt reluctant to pursue the matter further for fear of further magnifying its importance. Nor was it again raised on the Iranian side, and by the end of the year it was possible to hope that the incident was closed. (e) Iranian Fishery Survey. 27. It was learned in the autumn that the Iranian Government had engaged a Danish expert, by name Dr. H. Blegvad, to undertake a survey of the fisheries in the Persian Gulf, and had bought or chartered a Danish fishing vessel, with a crew of four, to carry out the work. 28. As it wms feared that difficulties might arise if Dr. Blegvad’s vessel (which would be flying the Iranian flag) visited any of the Arab ports or even any of the Arab pearl banks on the high seas, the Political Resident explained the position orally to Dr. Blegvad when the latter arrived in Bushire early in December. Dr. Blegvad replied that he did not propose to call anywhere on the Arab coast, and that he had no desire to court complications by visiting any Arab pearl banks. He said that he would be glad to avoid them if he could be given a chart on which they were marked, since he was not concerned with pearl banks but solely with fishing. (f) Lighting and Buoying. 29. The redrafted protocol for the transfer to the Iranian Government of the lights, buoys and beacons maintained by the Government of India on Iranian territory and in Iranian waters (see paragraph 92 of the annual report for 1935) received the approval of the Government Departments concerned in the early part of the year, and on the 18th March the revised text was communicated semi officially to the Iranian Government. Most of the changes in the text were concerned with points of form, the only one of real importance being the omission of the article in the Iranian draft enabling the Iranian Government to purchase and move the Qais Island lightship at a later date. The reason for this omission was that it was thought that the Government of India were likely to need the lightship themselves for other purposes when the Iranian Government ceased to rent it. At the same time Mr. Butler communicated to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs a suggested draft exchange of notes containing assurances from the Iranian Government that dues would not be levied on international shipping at a rate greater than was necessary to cover the expenses of the lighting service, and that sympathetic consideration would be given to any views regarding the service expressed by the representatives of interested shipowners. Colonel Bayendor having previously mentioned his desire to place a light on Stiffe Bank, Mr. Butler also informed the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the Government of India had decided to place one there themselves at an early date. None of these points were new, but a question that was now raised for the first time was that of the payment of dues by oilers flying the Blue Ensign. The existing position was that the Admiralty paid a certain sum to the Government of India in respect of these oilers in return for the latter’s lighting service, this being regarded as an ex gratia payment, though the sum was computed on the basis of the dues which would have been paid had Admiralty oilers been liable. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs were now informed that, on the transfer of the lights and buoys to Iranian ownership, the Admiralty would be happy to make a similar payment to the Iranian Government based on the volume of Blue Ensign tonnage benefiting from the lighting service at the rate of 3 pies per net registered ton. It was explained that this offer was made, not because the Admiralty considered that as a matter of international custom such dues should be paid, but because they realised the exceptional nature of the traffic and on the understanding that they would not subsequently be called upon to pay at a higher rate. 30. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs replied semi-officially to Mr. Butler’s communication on the 20th June, and indicated six points on which the Iranian Government held views different to those of the Government of India :— (1) They considered that the preamble to the protocol was unnecessary; (2) Articles 2, 3 and 5 of the redrafted protocol provided that the arrange ments made for the lease of the Qais Island lightship and for the maintenance by Colonel Ward of the lightship and of the lights, &amp;c..[15259] B ^ which the Iranian Government were purchasing were to operate for five years, but might be denounced by either party after a minimum period of one year on giving six months’ notice. The Iranian Govern ment now maintained that they aione should have the right to cancel any of these arrangements before the expiry of the full term of five years, as they would be left in an awkward position if the Government of India denounced them before their own new arrangements were completed; (3) As regards the proposal of the Government of India to place a light on Stifle Bank, the Iranian Government reaffirmed the intention of the Iranian lighting authorities to place a light there themselves, and an official of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs argued that in waters near to the shores of Iran it was a matter for the Iranian authorities, and not for any other Government, to make the necessary lighting arrangements; (4) The Iranian Government held that Blue Ensign oilers were liable for dues in the same way as other shipping, but undertook never to discriminate against them; (5) The Ministry for Foreign Affairs stated that any suggestions as to the lighting service which might be expressed by interested shipowners would be attentively examined by the Iranian lighting authorities. Though the Ministry did not expressly say so, it appeared unlikely, however, that the Iranian Government would be ready to repeat this assurance in a more formal document; and (6) As regards the desired assurance about dues, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs stated that the Iranian Government could not give any formal undertaking on this point, as they regarded the levying by any Government of taxes, dues or other imposts as a matter which fell exclusively within the competence of that Government. Nevertheless, the policy of the Iranian Government was to fix their charges in relation to their expenditure, and they wmuld in no way regard such charges as a source of revenue. The views of the Iranian Government on these points were communicated to the Foreign Office and to the Government of India. They were still under consideration at the end of the year. 31. Early in the year the Ministry for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Legation that instructions had been sent to the Iranian naval detachment at Hen jam to take over the task of cleaning the light there, which had formerly been performed by Cable and Wireless (Limited) (see paragraph 94 of the annual report for 1935). (g) Henjam and Basidu. 32. When Henjam and Basidu were evacuated in the spring of 1935 the Iranian Government readily agreed to the request of Flis Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom that the British cemeteries there should be respected and that all facilities should be accorded to any person whom Flis Majesty’s Minister might authorise to visit them from time to time to ensure their proper upkeep. 33 On the 22nd and 23rd September, 1936, H.M.S. Bideford visited Henjam and Basidu, and Captain D. B. Fisher, O.B.E., R.N., inspected the cemeteries. Various small repairs were carried out, but Captain Fisher reported that the general condition of both cemeteries was satisfactory. The local authorities in both places gave all possible facilities for the visit, and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs showed much sympathetic interest. 34. Following on the evacuation of the naval base at Henjam and the closure of the cable station maintained by Cable and Wireless (Limited), arrange ments were made during the course of the year for the British India Steam Navigation Company to discontinue the call made there by their mail vessels. (h) Bahrein. 35. In a note, dated the 30th May, the Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to the notes exchanged in November 1935 between His Majesty’s Charge.1 IIIP1 ■ zr 10 d’Affaires at Jedda and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia on fhe subject of the levy of transit dues at Bahrein. He protested against the conclusion of this exchange of notes as being contrary to the indisputable rights of Iran, and stated that he must make all possible reserves in respect ot the present and future rights and interests of the Iranian Government. A copy oi this note was sent by the Iranian Government to the Secretariat of the League of Nations and to the Government of Saudi Arabia. 36. A reply to this note was sent to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 1st October, reminding him that the views of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom upon the question of the Iranian claim to Bahrein had been set forth on many occasions in the past, and notably in the note sent to Hovhannes Khan Mossaed by Sir Austen Chamberlain on the 18th February, 1929. A copy of this reply was communicated by His Majesty’s Government to the Secretary- General of the League of Nations. 37. It is typical of the Iranian Ministry for Foreign Affairs that they were then quite unable to trace Sir Austen Chamberlain’s note, and enquired whether His Majesty’s Legation had meant to refer to a note dated the 18th January, 1928. They were informed that the reference as given by His Majesty’s Legation was correct, but it is not known whether they ever succeeded in finding the right note. 38. The Saudi Arabian Government are understood to have replied to M. Samiy’s note by saying that they had no knowledge of the rights of the Iranian Government in Bahrein. 39. The Iranian Government somehow learned during the course of the summer that proposals were being discussed for the transfer of the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf from Bushire to Bahrein. An official of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs mentioned this to a member of the staff of His Majesty’s Legation, and then rather surprisingly confined himself to adding that the Ministry of the Interior would be glad to have the opportunity to make an offer for the Residency buildings at Bushire, which it was thought would make a suitable residence for the Governor. Neither then nor later did the Ministry for Foreign Affairs raise the political aspect of the move in any way. (i) Sirri. 40. Late in 1935 a native of Ras-al-Khaimah visited Sirri in his dhow and, while he was there, a band of about forty inhabitants of the island removed all its sails and other gear, stating that their action was in retaliation for some previous act on the part of the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah. 41. In March 1936, when the facts became known, His Majesty’s Legation on the instructions of the Foreign Office officially sought the assistance of the Iranian Government in securing reparation for the victim. At the same time the qualification was added that this request should not be regarded as constituting an admission by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom of the Iranian claim to de jure sovereignty over Sirri Island. The request arose from a recognition of the de facto occupation of the island by the Iranian customs authorities. 42. The Minister for Foreign Affairs replied to this note in October, stating that he understood that the dispute had been settled. He then proceeded to affirm that “ the right of the Imperial Government to the ownership of Sirri Island is both de facto and de jure, definitely established and unquestionable.” The Foreign Office, to whom the matter was referred, decided that, as the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom towards the Iranian claim to sovereignty over the island had been fully stated in the past, a further reiteration of their attitude was unnecessary on this occasion. This aspect of the matter was therefore not further pursued. At the end of the year, however, His Majesty’s Legation were still waiting to learn from the Political Resident whether the incident had in fact been amicably settled as was stated by the Iranian Government. (j) Arab Dhows. 43. On the 14th May, a Koweiti dhow bound from Muscat to Koweit was tacking against the wind off the Iranian shore near Lingah, when an Iranian customs launch approached and without any warning opened fire on her. Three11 members of the dhow’s crew were wounded, one of them seriously. The launc then came alongside and ordered the dhow to proceed to Lmgah, but w en i was noticed that she was registered at Koweit, the order was cancelled and her sapper was told that he might proceed on his voyage. 44. His Majesty’s Legation referred the case to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs as soon as the facts were known and asked that a most searching enquiry might be made. Subsequently further particulars were obtained as to the identity of the customs launch (whose captain had apparently not reported the incident on arrival at Lingah) and these were communicated orally to the Ministry lor Foreign Affairs, as the latter professed that great difficulties were being experienced in identifying the launch concerned. 45. On the 22nd October an Omani dhow, bound from Khasab to Debai and having two rifles on board, was seized by a customs launch about 4 miles oft Hormuz Island. The crew were released, as was the dhow, on the 30th October, after being tried by martial law on a charge of carrying arms m Iranian territorial waters, but the rifles were confiscated. 46 It was decided to take the case up semi-officially with the Ministry for Foreio-n Affairs and to ask for the return of the rifles, since the men were obviously not regarded as smugglers, and since, so far as His Majesty s Legation aere aware the carriage of arms in transit through Iranian territorial waters was not illegal The proposed approach to the Ministry was, however, delayed beyond the°eud of the year, as His Majesty’s Legation were still awaiting particulars as to the exact nationality of the men concerned. (k) Muscati Passports. 47. During the course of the year a newly appointed member of the staff of His Majesty’s consulate-general at Meshed brought with him a servant who was the holder of a Muscati passport. The Iranian consul at Karachi gave the latter a visa to enter Iran, though on a separate piece of paper and not on the passport itself; but when application was made to the Meshed police for a residence permit for him, they replied that, as the Iranian Government did not officially recognise Muscat, a Muscati subject who wished to reside m this country must take out an Iranian sijill. 48 The case was taken up semi-officially with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and it was pointed out to them that, though the Iranian Government did not recognise Muscat, under Iranian law there was no objection to the entry ot Muscati subjects into Iran. It therefore seemed somewhat absurd to try to force them on arrival to become Iranian subjects. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs rather surprisingly accepted this view without demur and agreed that Muscatis who mioht come to this country must obviously be treated as foreigners. icy accordingly approached the police, who similarly agreed, and the case ended with the despatch of instructions to the Meshed police to grant the man a residence permit. (l) Cable and Wireless {Limited). 49 Early in the year His Majesty’s Legation received the equivalent of £136 in repayment of certain customs duties and other charges wrongly levied on Cable and Wireless (Limited), and in October the company eventually obtained uavment of their long overdue account of £2,669 for repairs carried out to tie Henjam-Bandar Abbas cable in 1932. It will be remembered that the company s cable ship carried out free repairs to this cable m the autumn of 193o m return for a promise by the Iranian Government to settle the 1932 account. 50 The company experienced a certain amount of trouble at Jask during the course of ttesumme^ as the local customs office informed them that they had no right to let one of their unwanted buildings to the Air France and h.L.M. companies for the accommodation of their passengers and claimed a refund of the renthitherto paid by them. The matter was taken up by II is Majesty s Legation with the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, it being represented to him that the company were only remaining at Jask in order to oblige the Iranian authorit , and that it was felt that they were entitled in equity to recoup some part of their heavy expenditure in which they were thus involved by letting accommodation [15259] B 612 to the air lines. The Minister of Posts and Telegraphs proved most sympathetic and secured the issue of instructions to the customs officer at Jask that the claim for rent was to be dropped. 51. At the end of the year the company, who had recently handed over certain unwanted buildings at Jask of which the local authorities desired the use, were asked to hand over further accommodation there, as well as an unused tennis court for the establishment of a wireless office and the erection of a mast. This request the company agreed to, but took the opportunity to enquire whether the establishment of a wireless station would advance the date when they would be able to evacuate their cable station, and to request that they might be informed of the date as long as possible in advance. (m) Meteorological Stations. 52. The withdrawal of Cable and Wireless (Limited) from Charbar and Hen jam in the autumn of 1935 raised the question of the future of the meteoro logical stations hitherto maintained there by the company on behalf of the Government of India. Arrangements were made for the station at Charbar to be operated by the agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company; but the station at Hen]am had to close down and, in view also of the fact that it would not be more than a year or two before a similar problem arose at Jask, it seemed desirable to discuss the problem with the Iranian Government, and see whether they were considering establishing any meteorological service of their own. 53. Unofficial discussions showed that the Iranian authorities were very interested in this question, probably because of the preparations that were being made for the establishment of an Iranian civil air service, and enquiries were received as to whether the instruments hitherto in use at Henjam or elsewhere were for sale. After correspondence with the Government of India, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs were informed in November that the Government of India would be happy to hand over the instruments as a gift for the use of the Iranian meteorological service. No conditions were attached to the gift, but the Govern ment of India would welcome it if an Iranian station was established in the neighbourhood of Henjam or on the northern shore of the Persian Gulf. If the station was established in some place from which reports would be of value to the Indian meteorological service, the Government of India would be glad to receive a daily telegram either on payment or in return for a similar telegram from any one station in India at the choice of the Iranian Government. Should the Iranian Government further desire to organise a service throughout Iran, the Government of India would be most happy to assist them in any way they could, and their meteorological department would gladly arrange, if desired, for the visit of one of their officers to Iran. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs expressed warm thanks for this communication, but no definite reply had been received from them by the end of the year. (n) Charbar. 54. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Legation in March that the petition of Haji Abdul Hussein, the leader of the Khoja com munity at Charbar, for the renunciation of his Iranian nationality had been granted. The last point at issue between the Iranian Government and His Majesty’s Legation in regard to this small community of British subjects was thus happily settled. 55. According to the Iranian regulations, persons who relinquish their Iranian nationality are obliged to leave Iran within one year. The great majority of the Khojas should, therefore, have left the country by July, but it is understood that they were all still at Charbar at the end of the year. Many of them had fairly considerable interests there, and it is likely that they were all reluctant to leave Iran until they were actually forced to do so. 56 56. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs also agreed during the course of the year that seven of the ten natives of British Baluchistan, whose cases had been taken up the year before, were correct in claiming that they had been born outside Iran. The authorities therefore agreed that they should not have been regarded13 as Iranian nationals, and instructions were sent to the local police to return them their British passports. The authorities were not, however, willing to admit the claims of the other three without further evidence in support of their statements. Their cases were still unsettled at the end of the year. (3) East Iran. (a) Baluchistan Frontier Questions. 57 In September 1935, after lengthy discussions (see paragraphs 136 to 149 of the annual report for 1935), His Majesty’s Minister had communicated to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs the draft of a note which he was prepared to address to the Iranian Government officially, to confirm the measures which the Govern ment of India had adopted or were ready to adopt to assist the Iranian authorities on the Baluchistan frontier. After a delay of four months an official of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Minister m January IJJh that the Iranian Government had decided to let the matter drop, as they had been unable to obtain one of their desiderata, namely, an undertaking from the Government of India to confiscate the arms of all tribesmen from Iranian Baluchistan who might take refuge in British territory. His Majesty s Minister left the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in no doubt as to the unfortunate impression produced by so'discourteous an attitude on the part of the Iranian Government, but it was felt that there would be no advantage in pressing for the continuation of negotiations, and the matter was accordingly allowed to drop. 58. At the beginning of the year His Majesty’s Minister informed the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that the method adopted by the Iranian authorities of referring minor frontier questions, such as requests tor the return of stolen camels, to His Majesty’s Legation for settlement involved such delays that it frequently proved impossible to pursue them with any hope oi success. The only sensible way of dealing with such matters was to refer them to His Majesty’s consular officer on the spot, and no responsibility could be accepted if the Iranian authorities continued to follow their present ridiculously long- winded procedure. Nevertheless, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs continued repeatedly during the course of the year to refer to His Majesty s Lega ion requests for the return of stolen property carried across the frontier as well as requests for the extradition of robbers, refugees and others Much unnecessaiy duplication of work was also caused by the fact that many of these requests were referred locally to His Majesty’s consular officers as well, the Iranian authonties seldom giving any indication that they were pursuing the matter through moie than one channel It several times proved possible to meet the requests of the Iranian authorities for the recovery of stolen property, though they usually only furnished the scantiest of details, but a certain amount of embarrassment was caused by the frequent requests put forward for the extradition of fugitives. The instructions of His Majesty’s Legation and His Majesty s consular officeis m regard to such requests were to return “ a courteous intimation that the Govern ment of India, in the absence of an extradition treaty, regret that they aie not prepared to extradite fugitives from Persian justice and, though details of such requests were always noted and forwarded to the Government of India so that a watch might, if necessary, be kept on the fugitives m question, it was felt that the invariable necessity of refusing extradition placed His Majesty s Legation and His Majesty’s consuls in the false position of appearing unwilling to co-operate in the settlement of frontier questions. The embarrassment of this position, it maybe added was naturally felt more strongly by His Majesty s consuls m Last H an where such questions loomed large, than in Tehran, where their importance was overshadowed by other matters. After some discussion with the Govei nment of India, it was felt desirable to clarify the position with the Iranian Government, and His Majesty’s Legation were accordingly authorised to make an oial com munication to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, pointing out that the Government of India could under no circumstances consider the extradition of any individual but that all stolen property would be returned as far as possible and that deserters from the Iranian forces would be removed from the frontier rf they seemed likely toTause trouble In general, the authorities m British Baluchistan would do their utmost both to effect a settlement of all border tribal offences in co-opera- tion with the Iranian authorities and to prevent British territory from being used [15259] B 714 as a base for offences in Iran. In these circumstances it was suggested that the following procedure should be adopted for the future :—■ (1) No further requests for extradition should be put forward either locally or in Tehran. (2) Routine requests for the return of stolen arms, camels, &amp;c., should be referred at the earliest possible moment to His Majesty’s vice-consul at Zahidan, and should not be raised in Tehran at all. (3) Only incidents possessing real importance or raising some question of principle should be taken up by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs with His Majesty’s Legation. This communication was read over to an official of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs by the oriental secretary on the 15th October. No reply had been received by the end of the year, though in a later conversation M. Ansarie said that he hoped that the Ministry of War would agree to the suggestion that all minor questions should be settled locally. Personally he thought that this was the only sensible way of dealing with them. 59. Practically none of the many questions referred to His Majesty’s Legation during the course of the year were of any importance in themselves, but one case is perhaps worth mentioning in detail. Early in the year the Ministry for Foreign Affairs stated that letters had been written by a certain Mir Jan Khan, who was described as a second lieutenant in the British levies, to an Iranian subject, Lashgar Khan Gumshadzai, inviting him to cross the frontier and settle in British Baluchistan. The Ministry requested that action should be taken to put a stop to such efforts to entice Iranian subjects from their allegiance. The matter was referred to the Government of India, who replied that no such person as Second Lieutenant Mir Jan Khan existed in British Baluchistan, and that in any case Lashgar Khan and the Gumshadzais were on account of their thieving habits not even allowed to enter British territory unless they gave particularly sound security for their good behaviour. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs were duly informed, but continued to insist that such letters had been written, and claimed to have them in their files. M. Ansarie even stated that the matter had been referred to the Shah, who had said that some time ago when tribes in British Baluchistan had wanted to take refuge in Iranian territory they had not been allowed to do so. His Majesty was therefore surprised that the good neighbourly attitude of the Iranian authorities had thus been repaid by attempts on the part of British officials to seduce Iranian subjects from their allegiance. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs were accordingly instructed to ask that the matter should be very carefully examined and to enquire why such propaganda was being conducted. 60. As it seemed impossible to pursue further enquiries with regard to the non-existent Mir Jan Khan, unless fresh evidence was produced, and as no information existed in British Baluchistan to show that tribes settled there had ever wished to take refuge in Iranian territory and had been refused permission to do so, His Majesty’s Legation were instructed by the Government of India to press for the loan of the letters in the one case and for some evidence in the other. This was in August, but despite several reminders nothing further had been received from the Ministry by the end of the year. 61 62 61. One other case deserves a brief mention. A caravan travellino- in Iranian Baluchistan was robbed in February 1935, and two British subjects were killed. The robbers fled across the frontier, where the authorities succeeded in recovering some of the stolen property. Arrangements were at once made to restore it, and it was handed over to Iranian officials at the frontier in March 1935. At the end of September 1936 it was discovered that no part of the property stolen from the two murdered British subjects and subsequently recovered had been handed over to their heirs. His Majesty’s Leo-ation accordingly took the matter up with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and &amp; asked for an enquiry to be made. (b) Incident at Gorich Kalag. 62. The Gorich Kalag incident (see paragraphs 189 to 197 of the annual report for 1935) was allowed to fade gently into oblivion early in the year. Once they had studied their maps, the Iranian Government realised clearly that Gorich15 [15259] B 8 Kalag indubitably lay in British territory, and that their precipitate accusation that British forces had encroached on Iranian territory was totally unrounded. This, officials of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs were prepared privately to admit, but as a face-saving gesture the Iranian Government nevertheless decided to send a colonel and an official of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to examine the frontier. The Ministry requested that instructions should be sent to the British authorities concerned to allow the Iranian officials to cross the f ion tier, should they have need to do so, but they were informed in reply that no under taking to this effect could be given. Nevertheless, arrangements would be made for a British official to meet them at the actual frontier and an early reply was requested in order that such arrangements might be made. By this time the Iranian representatives had already left and the next that was heard was on the 20th January, ten days later, when the Ministry for Foreign Affairs stated that investigations on the frontier had been completed, and that no necessity had arisen for getting in touch with any British official. 63. No further communication followed the return of the Iranian officials, and it was obvious that the Iranian Government had no further case to put up, yet would not on the other hand be prepared to make any apology. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India equally felt that there would be no advantage in reopening the case, but His Majesty’s Minister was authorised to point out orally the extreme discourtesy shown by the Iranian Government in protesting about the alleged encroachment without making adequate preliminary enquiries, and secondly, in waiting until the investigations of their officials on the frontier were complete before informing His Majesty’s Legation that they would not require to get in touch with anyone on the British side. His Majesty’s Minister accordingly spoke in this sense to the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Aifairs, telling him that the Govern ment of India had been treated with great discourtesy and could not be expected to overlook it. Nevertheless, it was not desired that the incident should acquire disproportionate importance. This conversation took place at the end of January and the matter was afterwards allowed to drop. (c) Commandeering of Indian Lorry Drivers. 64. In 1935 His Majesty’s Legation had submitted a claim for compensation in respect of the death of two Indian lorry drivers and of the losses and injuiies sustained by a number of others as a result of their having been commandeered by the military authorities at Zahidan at the end of 1934 and forced to proceed to a disturbed area where hostilities were in progress with insurgent Baluchis. At the close of 1935 His Majesty’s Legation were also forced to refer to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs yet another case of commandeering at Zahidan, though fortunately on this second occasion there had been no casualties. Much time was spent in 1936 in endeavouring to obtain the settlement of these cases and adequate safeguards for the future. 65. His Majesty’s Minister, before his departure on leave at the end of January, pressed the matter in its various aspects very strongly with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and received oral assurances from him both that compensa tion would be paid and that instructions had been issued to the military authorities in Iranian Baluchistan to observe strictly in future the proper pio- cedure governing commandeering of lorries. These assurances were subsequently confirmed in air official note which, though obscurely worded, implied that commandering would in future be arranged not through the militaiy but through the police or, in country districts, the road guards, that proper contracts would be drawn up, and that drivers would be compensated for any losses which they might sustain. 66. It, nevertheless, proved necessary to make strong and repeated repre sentations to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs before any further progress could be achieved. Eventually His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was obliged to warn the Minister for Foreign Affairs that there was a serious risk that, if there was any further delay, the matter might be taken up in India either in the press or m the Legislative Assembly, and that any publicity could not but be unpleasant foi the Iranian Government. He also furnished M. Samiy with an aide-memoire showing that the question of the 1934 claims had been raised with members of his depart ment on over twenty separate occasions. Fortunately, these representations had16 their effect, and in the middle of September a cheque was received for slightly under 75,000 rials (£935), which met in full all the 1934 claims. 1 he covering note stated, however, that this payment must not be regarded as constituting a precedent, and made no mention of the commandeering which occurred at the end of 1935. 67. To turn for a moment to the later case, the position was that fourteen British-owned lorries had been irregularly commandeered at Zahidan at the end of 1935, that nine British subjects had been maltreated, and that five claimed damages in respect of lorries or parts seized by the military authorities. Further more, a number of lorries had been damaged as a result of overloading, and the military authorities, who had fixed no rates of hire with the drivers in advance, were only willing after the event to pay them at quite uneconomic rates. The matter was taken up most energetically by His Majesty’s vice-consul at Zahidan, but though the Governor-General of Mehran proved sympathetic and appointed a commission to go into the matter, the military authorities refused to pay more than the original rates offered. These rates the Indian drivers refused to accept, communicating their refusal in writing to the Governor-General, and the whole question thus remained open. It is noteworthy, however, that the commanding officer, who doubtless realised that he had acted most irregularly, and possibly feared trouble from Tehran, endeavoured to hush the whole matter up by offering the drivers an extra 500 rials (£6 5s.) out of his own pocket. 68. When the cheque was received to meet the 1934 claims it was therefore necessary to point out to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that nothing had apparently been done to settle the 1935 case. The request was therefore made that the matter should be speedily closed by the issue of instructions to the authorities at Zahidan to pay the drivers concerned for their services at the rate of hire equivalent to the prevailing market rate, and to reimburse them for any losses and damages which they had suffered while under the orders of the military. Despite this request, the matter unfortunately still remained unsettled at the end of the year. 69. Early in the year it had been discovered that articles of the treaty of 1935 between Iran and Bussia provided that the nationals of each country, while in the territory of the other, should be exempt from all forms of compulsory service, whether civil or military, except in the event of some calamity of nature. A later paragraph of this same article extended to loans under compulsion. After an exchange of correspondence with the Foreign Office and the Government of India, His Majesty’s Legation was authorised to endeavour to secure most-favoured nation treatment for British subjects in this respect under article 12 of the Anglo- Persian Treaty of 1857, and it was decided to request that exemption from commandeering should be extended not only to British subjects but to their lorries as well, on the ground that the commandeering of a lorry was tantamount to a loan made under compulsion. No steps were taken to put forward this request until the 1934 claims had been met, though an unofficial warning of the intended action was given earlier to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs; but on receipt of the cheque it seemed that the moment had arrived to endeavour to regularise the matter for the future, and an official request was accordingly made that instructions should be issued to all the authorities concerned that British lorry-drivers and British- owned lorries should be exempt from commandeering except in the single clear contingency of some calamity of nature. It proved impossible to extract a reply to this note by the end of the year. (d) Lorry Traffic on the Zakidan-Nok Kundi Road. 70. Much correspondence was exchanged during the early part of the year between the Government of India, His Majesty’s Legation and His Majesty’s consul-general for Khorassan in an endeavour to devise a system for the regulation of traffic on the Zahidan-Nok Kundi road which would remedy the grievances at present felt both by the Government of India and the Iranian Government. In previous years the great bulk of the traffic had been carried in Indian-owned lorries, but the treatment of Indian drivers by the Iranian authorities was in many respects vexatious. On the other hand, the Iranian Government were annoyed at the refusal of the Government of India to grant visas to operate onthe Indian section of the route to the drivers of a recently-formed Iranian semi- Government company, this refusal being prompted by the fear that the company desired, by working at uneconomic rates, to drive Indian drivers off the route, and to concentrate all the traffic in its own hands. There was thus much material for discussion. 71. After various alternative proposals had been considered, it was decided to suggest to the Iranian Government an agreement on the following basis : (a) That only specially licensed vehicles should be allowed to ply on the route and that licences should be issued to Indian and Iranian-owned vehicles in proportion to the length of mileage on each side of the frontier, namely 87 miles on the Indian side to 51 on the Iranian. In view of the varying size of the lorries operating on the route, it was proposed that the division should be made in terms of the total tonnage capacity of the vehicles to be licensed, 87/138ths being reserved for Indian and 51/138ths for Iranian-owned lorries. (b) That minimum freight rates to be charged on the route should be fixed by mutual agreement. 72. This proposal was referred to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs at the end of May. It was later discussed with officials of the Ministry who clearly regarded it as being unduly elaborate and suggested that all that was necessary was for the Government of India to withdraw their ban on the lorries of the East Iran Transport Company. Their argument was that there was no likelihood of the company ever wishing to put on the route as many lorries as they would be entitled to operate under the proposal put forward by His Majesty’s Legation, and as the company was out to make profits like any other concern, there was no need for the Government of India to feel anxiety that Indian lorries would be driven off the route. It was explained to the Ministry on the other hand that, quite apart from the competition of this semi-Government company, the Govern ment of India were by no means satisfied that Indian drivers were receiving fan- treatment, and that there were a number of grievances which it was desired to see remedied. It therefore seemed much wiser to tackle the whole question comprehensively and to reach an agreement fair to both sides that would settle all outstanding points of difference. This view seemed to make some impression on the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, who promised to refer the matter to the Ministry of the Interior for their views. 73. As the summer wore on, however, it became apparent that the newly introduced Iranian exchange restrictions were causing the flow of trade on this route to sink to a fraction of its former proportions. Such traffic as there was was moreover, being carried exclusively by Indians, but His Majesty s consul- general reported that they all feared that if the East Iran Transport Company were once allowed to operate on the Indian section of the route, means would be found by the authorities to bring pressure to bear on traders which would result in the company securing the whole of the traffic, however carefully any agreement for its distribution might be drawn. It was pointed out to them that if no lorries belonging to the Iranian company were allowed to cross the frontier into India, the Iranian Government might at any time take the logical step of banning Indian lorries from Iran. As most of the Indians concerned lived at Zahidan, such a step on the part of the Iranian Government would mean that they would be driven out of their homes. Colonel Daly who visited Tehran in August to discuss this and other questions stated, however, that this was a risk which the Indians were prepared to face; he, moreover, fully shared their apprehensions and felt convinced that in existing circumstances an agreement with the Iranian Government would not assist, but kill the Indian interests affected. 74. It was therefore decided not to press the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in any way for a reply to the proposals for an agreement. Rather surprisingly the Ministry also refrained from reverting to the matter, and things were there fore allowed to remain where they were for the remainder of the year. (e) Expulsion of British Subjects. 75. At the beginning of the year representations were made to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs with regard to the procedure followed by the Iranian [152591 B 918 authorities when they desired to expel British subjects from the country. It was pointed out that when the police served notices of expulsion they gave no reasons for their action so that the persons concerned, though they had the right of appeal to the Ministry of the Interior, did not know what there was against them, and were thus quite unable to draft appeals which stood any chance of success. Moreover, no reply was ever returned by the Ministry of the Interior to such appeals, the only intimation of their failure being given orally to the persons concerned by the local police, that is to say, the very authorities against whose order the appeal had been lodged. Finally, the persons who were to be expelled were then given no period of grace to wind up their affairs, but were put across the frontier immediately. It was, therefore, suggested that, when the police served a British national with a notice of expulsion, they should also give him in writing a detailed statement of the reasons for their order; that if the man then appealed to the Ministry of the Interior and his appeal was rejected, notice of rejection in writing should be communicated to him by the Ministry and not by the local police; and that he should then be allowed a reasonable period of grace, say one month, in which to leave the country. 76. These suggestions were sympathetically received and the matter was subsequently discussed on a number of occasions with officials of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The latter said that they regretted that they would be unable to reply in writing to His Majesty’s Legation’s note, as they regarded the points raised therein as coming entirely within the scope of the internal administration regulations of the country, but they took the matter up with the other departments concerned, and towards the end of the year informed His Majesty’s Legation orally of the new system which the authorities were now proposing to adopt. This system seemed adequately to meet the points raised by His Majesty’s Legation, except that it appeared that foreign nationals would still not be fully informed of the reasons for which their expulsion was ordered, though a general indication would henceforth be given them. As the Ministry specifically invited His Majesty’s Legation to comment on the new system, this one point was referred back to them with the request that fresh consideration might be given to the possibility of providing greater details. The Ministry appeared sympathetic and their further views were awaited at the end of the year. (f) Pilgrims. 77. A conciliatory letter was received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the end of January in reply to the representations of His Majesty’s Minister in regard to the harsh treatment of Indian pilgrims to Meshed by the Iranian customs and police. M. Kazemi suggested that many of the difficulties experienced by pilgrims seemed mainly due to their ignorance of the regulations and added that to facilitate their passage through the customs, it had been decided to post up in every custom-house a full list of the goods which travellers might not import or export, as well as the text of the regulations in force concerning the carriage of goods in transit across the country. M. Kazemi suggested that these regulations should also be communicated to pilgrims before their departure by the authorities in India. His letter finally stated that instructions had been sent to all customs officials and to local authorities in the interior of the country to behave with all courtesy towards pilgrims and other travellers. 78. This letter was accompanied by an official note in regard to the misfortunes of a party of pilgrims at Damghan, which had been strongly repre sented to the Ministry by His Majesty’s Minister the previous autumn (see paragraph 166 of the annual report for 1935). The customs now agreed to return the fifty silk saris which had been confiscated from the ladies of the party and to reduce the fine of approximately £35 levied on them to the nominal one of 130 rials (£1 125. 6d). 79 79. Undoubtedly the general instructions mentioned above, and possibly the example of this one particular case, did a lot of good, for no complaints reached His Majesty’s Legation during the remainder of the year with regard to the behaviour of the customs authorities, and only once with regard to the police. It must be remembered, however, that Iran derives considerable revenue from the pilgrim traffic to Meshed, and that it is strongly in her own interest not to let any situation develop which might result in a diminution of the flow.[15259] B 10 19 80. Despite M. Kazemi’s statement that a list of regulations for travellers was being posted up in all custom-houses, it took His Majesty’s Legation nearly the whole year to obtain a copy from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. When the text was eventually received at the end of October, it was found to be somewhat long and complicated, but it undoubtedly helped to clarify the position, and it is ^ to be hoped that future travellers will benefit from it&gt;. The good impression caused by the adoption of a more reasonable attitude by the Iranian authorities towards pilgrims was, however, somewhat marred by a typically inconsiderate action at the time of Muharram. The movement for the unveiling of Iranian women was then in full swing and no Iranian woman in a chadur was allowed to enter the shrine in Meshed. This, of course, did not apply to foreign women, but in view of the physical resemblance between many Iranians and Indians, the Iranian Government decided to restrict the number of foreign pilgrimages to Meshed during the months of Muharram and Safar (the 25th March to the 21st May) in order that the fanaticism of the local inhabitants might not be aroused by the spectacle of some women being allowed into the shrine veiled while others were not. No visas were, therefore, issued to Indian pilgrims during those two months. What was a matter for regret was that the Iranian Government took no steps to communicate this decision to the Government of India, with the result that when pilgrims arrived at the frontier at Mirjawa, where they normally obtained their visas (before the earthquake they used to obtain them at Quetta), they were summarily turned back. In view of the considerable distances involved, pilgrims were thus subjected to much hardship. Moreover, it took His Majesty’s Legation ten days to extract any explanation from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and it later even transpired that, when the Under-Secretary had proposed giving some notice of the decision of the Iranian Government, M. Kazemi had decided that it and the reasons therefor were too delicate for any advance notification to be given. By this time the milk had been spilt and there was not much to be gained by crying over it; but the opportunity was taken to impress with some urgency on the Ministry for Foreign Affairs the desirability in future of bringing regulations of this nature to the notice of all concerned without any delay. (g) Visits by non-Moslem British Subjects to the Shrine at Meshed. 81. Prior to the disturbances in the holy shrine at Meshed in the summer of 1935, it had been virtually impossible for any European to enter it except in disguise. After the disturbances, however, the authorities began to encourage visits by Christians, doubtless in pursuit of their policy of destroying the power of the mullahs. Two parties of British travellers, including members of His Majesty’s Legation, were thus able to visit the shrine that autumn, being accompanied by substantial escorts of police and shrine officials. In each case it was given out by the authorities that the parties consisted of Turkish pilgrims. 82. These visits were repeated on a far larger scale at the end of August' 1936 by a party of British and Austrian students who were touring Iran under the auspices of the National Union of Students. It was again given out by the police that most of the party were Turks, but a local paper, referring to the arrival of the party in Meshed, announced that they were all British, and there can be no doubt that the news of their visit to the shrine was widely known. In fact, His Majesty’s consul-general for Khorassan received sufficient evidence as to the local reaction to the visit to convince him that serious anti-British feeling was thereby being aroused in Meshed, which might gravely endanger the lives of British residents there in the event of future disturbances. His Majesty’s Minister accordingly decided that, until the Iranian Government’s anti-clerical propaganda had so far affected public feeling that visits by non-Moslems weie no longer regarded locally as sacrilegious, everything possible should be done to prevent them being made by British subjects. (h) Zahidan Railway. 83. The Iranian Government, who had raised the question of the reopening of this railway on several occasions in 1935, did not refer to it at all in 1936. 84. A telegram was received from the Government of India in November stating that, owing to the great fall in trade by this route as a result of the introduction of the Iranian exchange restrictions, it was proposed to withdraw20 the terminus of the railway to Dalbandin in order to reduce the heavy loss at which the line was now worked. His Majesty’s Minister, whose comments were invited, suggested in reply that the withdrawal of the railhead, following so closely on the imposition of a land customs regime, might create an unfavourable atmosphere for the forthcoming negotiations for a new Indo-lranian Commercial Treaty. He was therefore inclined to advocate that the railhead should be allowed to remain where it was pending commercial negotiations, in which the question of the railway might perhaps be used as a valuable bargaining counter. (i) Zahidan Vice-Consulate. 85. His Majesty’s consul-general for Khorassan suggested officially at the beginning of the year that His Majesty’s vice-consulate at Zahidan should be established on a permanent basis. It had been established at the end of the war on a temporary footing only, and sanction for its continued existence had to be obtained annually from His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India. His Majesty’s Legation supported this proposal both because it was felt that Zahidan was becoming an increasingly important centre and because British interests there were considerable. 86. These views were accepted by the Government of India and by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, and it was accordingly definitely decided during the course of the year to establish the vice-consulate on a permanent basis. (j) Consulate Doctors. 87. At the end of 1935, after an objection from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that it was wrong in principle for a consular officer to exercise a second profession, the Iranian Government were informed that it was proposed henceforth to appoint both a vice-consul and a doctor to Zabul, where hitherto one man had combined both jobs. In return, the Iranian Government agreed that, as the necessary new arrangements could not be made immediately, the existing system should be allowed to continue in force for another three months (see paragraph 368 of the annual report for 1935). 88. When this three-months period was about to expire, His Majesty’s Legation, on the instructions of the Government of India, informed the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that, while the matter was under urgent consideration, it had not yet proved possible to make definite arrangements for the future. The Iranian Government were accordingly asked to prolong the period of grace during which the doctor could still be allowed to perform the functions of vice- consul. During the previous months, however, the Department of Health had taken urgent steps to establish an Iranian-run hospital in Zabul, and they accordingly now refused their consent to the prolongation of the existing dual arrangement, which they had only sanctioned in the first instance for the reason that the sudden closure of the consulate hospital would have caused great hardship in Zabul in the absence of other medical facilities. 89. In these circumstances, it was accordingly decided to terminate Colonel Pyper’s appointment as vice-consul and to renew his application for a medical licence, it being felt that it was important to establish his status as a doctor, and that the withdrawal of his consular rank would not seriously impede his ability to supervise the work of the vice-consulate, pending other arrangements. The Iranian Government at once took note of the termination of his consular appoint ment, but did not reply until the middle of July, four months later, with regard to his medical licence. They then stated that, as three Government physicians were now established in Zabul, and as a surgeon would shortly be proceeding there, there was no need for any other doctor there, and the Department of Health accordingly regretted that Colonel Pyper could not be given a licence. 90. This note caused a most unfortunate impression. It was then eight months since the Iranian Government had been informed that it was proposed to appoint both a vice-consul and a doctor to Zabul in future, and during that period they had not merely never demurred to the proposed arrangement, but had repeatedly explained that their sole objection was to the exercise of a second profession by an officer enjoying consular privileges. They had thus tacitly allowed the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government in the United21 [15259] B 11 Kingdom to proceed with their new arrangements, only to shift their ground completely at the eleventh hour. His Majesty’s Legation was accordingly instructed by the Government of India to return to the charge, but it proved impossible to secure any modification of the attitude of the Iranian Government. ^ 91. Meanwhile, the Government of India had been reconsidering their arrangements, and had decided that in future their doctor should reside at Meshed, visiting Birjand, Zabul and Zahidan when necessary. Thus, when the Ministry for Foreign Affairs repeated at the end of October that no licence could be issued to a doctor resident at Zabul, it was felt that there was still some hope of securing a licence valid for Meshed, and that there might even be no objection to his seeing patients outside the consulate staffs at the other places on his occasional visits there. But in view of the obscurity of the Iranian Government’s attitude, His Majesty’s Minister felt that it was desirable that he should be allowed some latitude to secure the best terms possible, and when the Government of India agreed decided that the best policy was to endeavour to reach some agreement by oral negotiation with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs which could subsequently be confirmed in writing. The changed position was accordingly explained to an official of the Ministry, and he was informed that an unrestricted licence for Meshed was now what was chiefly desired. The doctor would, however, * be visiting Birjand, Zabul and Zahidan as well, when necessity arose, and it was hoped that during his visits there, he would be allowed such facilities as could be agreed to, for outside practice. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs undertook to get in touch with the Department of Health, and to see what could be arranged, ' but nothing further had been heard from them by the end of the year. 92. This was not, however, the only question that arose. In the middle of October a note was received from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, stating that it was understood that Dr. Fazal Haq, His Majesty’s vice-consul at Birjand, was also pactising medicine. The note added that the Iranian Government had repeatedly brought to the notice of His Majesty’s Legation their view that a consular officer should not exercise a second profession, and they, therefore, requested that Dr. Fazl Haq should be instructed to cease practising medicine immediately. It was at once felt that, the principle having already been conceded in the case of Zabul, it was impossible to resist at Birjand; but while the question was still being considered whether it was preferable to terminate Dr. Fazal Haq’s consular or medical functions he himself received on the 11th November a peremptory order from the local Health Office couched in terms resembling a military command rather than anything else, to close his dispensary forthwith, failing which he would be prosecuted. Accordingly, when it was decided that it would be useless for Dr. Fazal Haq to resume his practice for the reason that no Iranian would henceforth be allowed by the police to visit his dispensary, and that it would be better for him to remain on solely as vice-consul, it was decided also that the discourtesy of the local officials could not be passed over in silence. His Majesty’s Minister, therefore, informed the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that, as they had not raised any objection to the position at Birjand when they had taken up the question of Zabul a year before, it had been assumed that they were prepared to make an exception in favour of Dr. Fazal Haq, who had acted both as vice-consul and doctor for many years past. Nevertheless, the Government of India now readily agreed to fall in with the Iranian Government’s wishes, and Dr. Fazal Haq had accordingly been directed to cease practising medicine, though it was presumed that he could still treat the consulate staff and British subjects At the same time it was regretted that the Department of Health had taken unilateral action to stop Dr. Fazal Haq’s practice before any reply had been received from His Majesty’s Legation, and still more did the latter deplore the tone in which the local Health Office had found it necessary to word their communication to His Majesty’s vice-consul. (4) Special Indian Relations. (a) Indian Land Customs Regime. 93. The Government of India decided during the course of the year to impose a limited customs regime, with effect from the 1st April, 1937, on all the land frontiers of India. The Iranian Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the' TS r' 22 Iranian consul-general in Delhi were simultaneously informed of this decision on the 5th December and a list was communicated to them of the articles which were likely to be made liable to duty at the sea customs rates. His Majesty s Legation had not received any reply to their communication by the end of the year. (b) Flags on Iranian Consulates in India. 94. The Iranian consul-general in Delhi continued at intervals throughout the year to complain to the Government of India that he and the other Iranian consuls in India were not being fairly treated in the matter of their right to fly the Iranian flag over their consular buildings. His claim to most-favoured nation rights w r as on one occasion supported in Tehran by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 95. Later, when the Government of India had made it clear that their attitude was based on considerations of reciprocity, and that they regarded the question of most-favoured-nation rights as irrelevant, M. Nourzad shifted his ground and argued that in that case reciprocity ought to be enforced as well against other foreign consuls who flew their flags daily, since he was convinced that in the majority of foreign countries British diplomatic and consular representatives only flew r their flags on special occasions. The matter was then referred to London, and the Foreign Office stated that, if the Government of India w r ould furnish a list of consuls who flew their flags daily, an endeavour would be made to find out wffiether British representatives in their countries w r ould be allowed in principle to do the same. (c) Incident involving Iranian Consul at Bombay. 96. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs complained orally on the 5th September that when M. Aliabadi, the Iranian consul at Bombay, had come to leave a month before on the termination of his appointment, bailiffs had appeared on the quay and publicly executed a decree of a Bombay court which had given judgment against him for some 500 rupees in a suit arising out of a summons for debt. The Iranian Government protested strongly against this grave violation of consular immunity, and M. Aliabadi’s successor had asked the Government of Bombay for a formal apology. 97. Enquiries showed that a Bombay doctor had taken out a summons against M. Aliabadi in respect of an unpaid bill for professional attendance. As a matter of courtesy the summons had been served on M. Aliabadi through the Government of Bombay and the Iranian consulate, but he had, nevertheless, not attended the court nor had he been legally represented. Judgment was given against him in his absence and as he was leaving Bombay that day the court ordered the immediate execution of the decree. The Government of Bombay, being unaware of this latter fact, wrote to the court requesting that the decree should be executed through official channels and not by the attachment of M. Aliabadi’s property; but the court either disregarded their request or did not receive it in time, with the result that an undoubtedly painful scene occurred on the quay in the presence of all who had come to see M. Aliabadi off. 98. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires accordingly explained what had happened to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, pointing out that consuls did not enjoy immunity from the jurisdiction of the local courts, that M. Aliabadi had placed himself entirely in the wrong by disregarding the summons of the court, and that in any case the judiciary were not amenable to the Executive. Neverthe less, Mr. Butler was authorised to express the regret of the Government of India that such a distressing scene should have taken place, that it had not proved possible for the Government of Bombay to avert it and that the judge had not seen his way to agree to the latter’s request that judgment should be executed through official channels. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs, whose feelings had appeared to be most outraged by the publicity of the scene, seemed satisfied with this explanation. In any event nothing more was heard from them. 99 99. It is typical of the methods of the Iranian Government that, having decided to make a protest, they raised the matter not only in Tehran and Bombaw but also in London and in Delhi.23 [15259J B 12 (d) Proposal to appoint Iranian Vice-Consul at Quetta. 100. The Iranian Minister in London informed the loreign Office in September that his Government desired to establish a vice-consulate at Quetta. With the exception of a period after the earthquake the Iranian Government had maintained an official there for some years, but he had only been recognised as a member of the staff of the consulate-general in Delhi with authority to issue pass ports and visas, and the proposal that he should now be given consular status therefore raised wider issues. The matter was accordingly referred to the Government of India and His Majesty’s Minister was also instructed to furnish his views. No decision had been reached by the end of the year. (e) Article in Calcutta Newspaper. 101. The Iranian consul-general in Delhi complained in June to the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India about an article on the Shah which had appeared in a Calcutta newspaper, the Rozana Hind. _ This complaint was later repeated orally to His Majesty s Legation by an official of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, who stated that the article contained some observations which he could not even bring himself to repeat. The Iranian consul-general in Delhi had been instructed to pursue the matter within the limits of the Indian press law, but the Minister for Foreign Affairs requested that particular attention should be paid to it. 102. The offending editor stated that the article in question had been copied from another Indian paper, the Millat, from the Berliner Tageolatt. It appeared on investigation, however, that his first statement was untrue, and the Iranian authorities, after enquiry in Berlin, later stated that equally no such article had appeared in the Berliner Tageblatt. I he Iranian consul-genera accordingly requested in October that the editor of the Rozana Hind should be prosecuted, and that all copies of the offending issue of the paper should be confiscated. 103. It is not known whether any further developments took place before the end of the year. (5) The Anglo-1 ranian Oil Company {Limited). 104. No serious differences arose between the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the Iranian Government during the year. Mr. Fraser deputy chairman of the companv, visited Tehran in the spring, and had an audience with the bhah and a number of conversations with Iranian officials. He professed himself as well satisfied with his visit, though he had to cut short his stay on account ot illness. 105. Two criminal charges, both of manslaughter, were brought against European members of the company’s staff during the year. 1 he one was a straightforward case arising out of a motor accident, in which negligence was admitted, but the other had certain features worthy of note. The British subject accused, a Mr. Mabbutt, was called out of his house at Abadan by a report that an accident had taken place. He accordingly summoned an ambulance and picked up the man, who later died. Subsequently, one of the company s own firemen testified that Mr. Mabbutt had himself run down the dead man and on the strength of this statement Mr. Mabbutt was kept m police custody for the ays. He was not allowed to communicate with his wife, His Majesty s vice-consul or any official of the company until the afternoon of the fifth day when His Majesty s consul at Ahwaz, by appealing to the safeguards, succeeded m persuading the Governor-General of Khuzistan to send instructions that Captain Ghauncey was to be allowed to visit him. Mr. Mabbutt was then released, but was tried six months later and was convicted, being sentenced to a term of imprisonment, which he was able to commute by paying a fine of approximately £8 He then desired to appeal, but was persuaded by the company to let the matter drop. 106 On the 20th December three British subjects employed by the company were waylaid and robbed by bandits in the Kashkuli tribal area between Ahwaz and Bushire. One of them, a Mr. MacLelland, was seriously wounded. I he authorities seem to have pursued the matter with energy, but only scanty details of the incident were available by the end of the year.(6) The Imperial Bank of Iran. 107. The year 1936 was an active year for the Imperial Bank of Iran. The Minister of Finance, when drawing up his plans at the end of February for a system of foreign exchange control, kept in close touch with the chief manager of the bank and accepted his advice on a number of points. Mr. Butters, on his side, was anxious that the Imperial Bank of Iran should be one of the banks authorised to deal in foreign exchange under the new system, and was therefore ready to adopt as helpful an attitude as possible towards the authorities. It was thus arranged that the bank should open a credit for £300,000 in favour of the Government, which they could use, if need arose, to support the exchange, and a further credit for £300,000 to finance the business operations of companies in which the Government held not less than 51 per cent, of the capital. In return the bank obtained the right to deal in foreign exchange and other not unimportant safeguards. 108. In the autumn the bank agreed to increase the second of these credits to £600,000, and, as the Government began at the same time to use their credit for the support of the exchange, the position at the end of the year was that the Government were drawing on the bank to the extent of some three-quarters of a million sterling. 109. The interests of the bank seemed threatened in December by a decision of the authorities that banks should not henceforth give advances to foreign companies engaged in railway construction, &amp;c., unless they were covered by deposits of foreign currencies, negotiable securities or gold. Hitherto the Imperial Bank of Iran had financed foreign contractors to a considerable total sum in return for guarantees from banks in Europe, and it seemed that this business which was both profitable and without risk might now be lost to them, since the foreign contractors concerned were nearly all either unable or unwilling to comply with the stipulations of the authorities. Mr. Butters felt however' that the authorities were unlikely to make serious difficulties for the bank if the position was properly represented to them, in view of the considerable credit facilities which the bank had accorded to the Government. In so far as the contractors themselves were concerned, it was chiefly foreign firms that were affected, but it may be noted here that two British firms, Messrs. Costain and Messrs. Nuttall, both engaged in railway construction, were equally involved. nu. in me summer tne bank was granted a supplemental ckarter, enabling B to increase its capital from £650,000 to £1 million. Its capital had originally stood at this latter figure, but had been reduced in 1894, and the present position' 1 * 5 ’ e CCte&lt; ’• V t ie ca P lta lisation of reserves, merely restored the old (7) Claims. further ^ r ^K S ^- C ^ m if Iranian Government was ^ -fj-j 0nbl ^ ei€( ^ m •^P I1( ^ on &gt; but no obvious line of advance presented itself and it did not prove possible for the Foreign Office to send His Majestv’s Leoation any definite instructions during the course of the year.

Mr ffirs a^rd/ngly25 [15259] B 13 advanced this suggestion in a private letter to M. Soheily, making it clear that he could not in any way commit the syndicate, but that he was anxious to make some advance towards the settlement of this long-standing matter before the arrival of a new British Minister. M. Soheily had made no reply to this letter ffct ^ by the end of the year. f (8) Complaints of British Aircraft Flying over Iranian Territory. 114. The extreme sensitiveness of the Iranian Government when they fancy that their sovereign rights have been infringed is well illustrated by the manner in which they complain to His Majesty’s Legation when they fancy that a British aeroplane has flown over Iranian territory without having previously obtained permission to do so. In June they complained that a Royal Air Force machine had flown over Iranian territory between Khorramshahr and Abadan on the 18th May, and in July a note was received saying that Imperial Airways machines were “continuing regularly” to fly over Iranian territory (the last complaint regarding an Imperial Airways machine had been made in March 1935), and that four of their aeroplanes had recently flown over Jask in company. Enquiry showed that this second complaint undoubtedly referred to four Royal Air Force machines that were returning from India, but in neither case did it appear that the Iranian complaints were well-founded. Suitably conciliatory replies were in each case returned to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 115. In October the Ministry for Foreign Affairs complained orally that two British machines had flown over Iranian territory when saluting H.M.S. Norfolk on her arrival at Basra. The Shah had ordered the matter to be taken up immediately. An official note followed, in which it was stated that the incident had caused an undesirable impression, and the request was made that the pilots of the aeroplanes in question might be reprimanded. Enquiries showed that no Royal Air Force machines could possibly have been involved, but that a machine belonging to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company had twice circled over the ship. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs were duly informed, and His Majesty’s Minister took the opportunity to remonstrate more strongly in conversation with M. Soheily at the manner in which the Iranian Government advanced complaints of this kind without first taking care to substantiate them. (9) British Subjects in Difficulties. 116. There was a noteworthy decrease in the year under review in the number of cases which were brought to the notice of His Majesty’s Legation of arbitrary or illegal action by the police or military against British subjects. The vigorous representations made to the Iranian Government by Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen in regard to the treatment of Indian pilgrims, the comman deering of British lorry drivers, the arbitrary manner in which British subjects were deported, &amp;c., undoubtedly bore good fruit, and, while much time had to be spent in 1936 in clearing up old cases, there was a most welcome decline in the number of new ones. 117 118 117. At the same time, in a “ Polizeistaat ” like Iran, individuals who get into trouble with the authorities are always likely to meet with less than justice, and though the authorities are, generally speaking, careful in their dealings with Europeans, they are always ready to assume that they can treat Indians as they like. Thus the protection of British, and more especially Indian, interests is something more than a formality for His Majesty’s Legation and consular officers, and the firm representation of cases of injustice is thus always necessary in order to remind the authorities that they must “ watch their step.” 118. No case involving any major issue or question of principle arose during the year, but mention may be made of one case as an illustration of the nature of the treatment to which British subjects remain liable at the hands of the authorities. An Indian lorry driver, named Bagh Singh, was accused of smuggling at Zahidan in 1934. He had an absolutely sound defence, and was acquitted by the court of first instance at Zahidan. The customs authorities then appealed to the Birjand court, who upheld the acquittal. In some manner, thedossier was then returned to Zahidan with instructions that the case should be tried by the customs authorities themselves {i.e., by the prosecutors), ihe customs inevitably convicted Bagh Singh and fined him 67,000 rials (£837 10s.), with the alternative of a day’s imprisonment for every 10 rials of the fine. He appealed against his conviction, and the Birjand court acquitted him for the second time in January 1936, the court declaring in its judgment that “it is evident from a perusal of the relevant file and its contents that there is no truth in the accusation and that it was merely a mistake.” Nevertheless, the customs again appealed, Bagh Singh being still held in custody, and he was acquitted for the fourth time in all in March. The customs appealed again, and Bagh Singh was acquitted for the fifth time in May by the Meshed Court of Appeal. Only then was he released, after spending eight months in prison. He wisely left the country without further delay, and it was learnt after his departure that the still dissatisfied customs had taken the case to Tehran, where the court acquitted Bagh Singh for the sixth time towards the end of the year. Tn order finally to establish his innocence, it was thus necessary for Bagh Singh to be tried seven times and to be acquitted six, the only occasion when he was convicted being when the trial was conducted by his prosecutors. 119. During the course of the proceedings Bagh Singh was naturally given such assistance as was possible by His Majesty’s Legation and consular officers. But the whole action of the customs authorities seemed so scandalous that it was decided that the matter could not be allowed to rest with Bagh Singh’s acquittal. As soon as it was learned that he was safely out of the country, His Majesty’s Minister therefore brought the whole history of the case to the notice of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and requested that a most thorough enquiry should be made. No reply had been received by the end of the year. (10) Foreign Exchange Difficulties. 120. The passage at the beginning of March of a law and regulations for the control of foreign exchange involved much hardship for a considerable number of British subjects. The regulations provided that foreigners employed in public establishments might remit up to 50 per cent, of their salary abroad, and that persons engaged in direct commercial relations with public establishments might transfer their profits up to 10 per cent, of their total transactions. These facilities were, however, of no assistance to many British subjects, and more especially Indians, who suddenly found themselves unable to remit abroad even the smallest sums for the education of their children, the support of dependents or for such purposes as the payment of insurance premiums. Furthermore, the introduction of exchange restrictions, following on the increasing monopolisation of foreign trade by the Government, proved the last straw for a number of Indians, who decided to liquidate their businesses and leave the country, but found that they were unable to remove their capital. 121. When some experience had been gained of the working of the Exchange Control Commission, two appeals were accordingly made to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs— (a) That the commission should be instructed to issue freely to British subjects permits to acquire small sums in foreign exchange for the maintenance of dependents abroad, &amp;c.; and (b) That sympathetic consideration should be given to applications from British subjects who desired to leave the country to liquidate their rial balances either by converting them into foreign currency or by exporting Iranian produce without the obligation laid down in the law of having to sell the proceeds to the Exchange Control Commission. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs took a considerable time to answer these requests. Their e\entual reply to (a) consisted of a recapitulation of the facilities specifically provided in the regulations, with an added statement that persons engaged in comnieice (without mention of public establishments) would be allowed to transfer their pi ofits to some extent, but that the grant of foreign exchange for othei pui poses would contravene the object of the law. As to (&amp;). the Ministry27 refrained from giving any indication of the general attitude of the commission and merely stated that the latter could not take a decision in any given case without being furnished with full details. 122. Consideration of these notes seemed to show that there was little or nothing to be gained by continuing to discuss these questions in general terms with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. His Majesty's Minister therefore decided that individual cases, where hardship was being occasioned to British subjects, must henceforth be dealt with separately by His Majesty’s Legation, and supported with the commission on their merits. Hitherto only applications of great urgency or possessing other special features had been taken up individually with the commission by His Majesty’s Legation, whose assistance and that of His Majesty’s consular officers had normally been restricted to the giving of certificates to applicants that their requests were regarded as genuine and deserving. 123. Accordingly, a typical application, that of an Indian goldsmith at Bandar Abbas who wished to remit some 640 rupees annually to India, was selected and treated as a test case, and Llis Majesty’s consul sought an interview with the president of the Exchange Control Commission to present it. Mr. Summerhayes pointed out that the man’s case was typical of those of a larger number of British subjects in Iran, that His Majesty’s Legation did not feel that fair treatment was being accorded to them, and that it was not understood why such applications were almost invariably refused, seeing that the regulations gave the commission full discretion to accept any application which they regarded as deserving, even though it might not be possible to invoke any specific clause in support of^it. Mr. Summerhayes found Dr. Hajeer unexpectedly sympathetic, and the latter confirmed his friendly words by granting not only the application from Bandar Abbas, but also those of a number of British subjects which Mr. Summerhayes also took the opportunity of representing to him. 124. It was accordingly decided at the end of the year to instruct His Majesty’s consular officers to furnish full lists of British subjects who had left or wished to leave Iran and export their assets, and to refer to His Majesty’s Legation for such support as could be given to them the most deserving cases winch came to their notice when British residents were unable to obtain permits to remit abroad reasonable sums for their own private purposes. 125. No difficulty was ever experienced in obtaining permits for ITis Majesty’s Legation or consulates to acquire foreign exchange for official purposes, and applications from British officials were nearly all accepted without demur; but it proved a tiresome business having to refer every single application to the commission, and it was accordingly suggested to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that special facilities might be given to His Majesty’s Legation and consulates and members of their staffs. Despite repeated reminders, however, it proved impossible to obtain any reply to this request. (H) Murder of Mr. E. A. Fear. 126 Mr E. A. Fear, a British subject employed as chief cashier by the firm of Richard Costain (Limited), who were engaged on the construction of one of the lots on the southern railway, was killed in a hold-up on the 25th April. He was returning by car from the bank in Khorramabad with 200,000 rials (£2,500) in cash when his car was stopped at a lonely place on the road. He, his chauffeur, and an Indian to whom he had given a lift, were all shot through the head at point-blank range and the money was stolen. With no survivors and no witnesses, the police were given a hard task, and although they appeared to pursue their investigations with energy, they had not succeeded in tracing the murderers by the end of the year. The chief of police in Tehran stated, however, as late as November last that a new clue had recently been discovered and that he hoped that it would lead to some result. 127. In view of the fact that Mr. Fear had discontinued his former practice of requesting the authorities to supply him with an armed guard on his journeys to the bank, and that the common practice among other contractors was to take no special precautions on these occasions, and as, moreover, a state of perfect [15259] B 14security had hitherto prevailed in the district, it was felt that no responsibility for the murder attached to the authorities and that no claim therefore lay against the Iranian Government. The firm, however, on their own put forward a request for an ex cjratia payment to Mr. Fear’s mother, but, though the authorities were sympathetic, they stated that they did not see how they could grant this request without creating a precedent. The matter was, therefore, allowed to rest. (12) Doctors and Midioives. 128. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs replied in January to the notes that had been addressed to them during the previous year requesting that certain institutions in the United Kingdom and the Dominions might be added to the list of medical schools, &amp;c., whose diplomas were recognised by the Iranian Government. The latter now stated that they would be happy to take steps to recognise the various medical faculties concerned, but that they would need for this purpose full details of their curricula. The Iranian Government also enquired what recognition would be given in the British Empire to diplomas issued by the Faculty of Medicine in Tehran. 129. The question at first seemed of some urgency as among the diplomas which the Iranian Government had not hitherto recognised were those of the Royal College of Physicians of London and the Royal College of Surgeons of England, and a Church Missionary Society doctor arrived early in the spring whose qualifications were precisely M.R.C.S., and L.R.C.P. It was thought that in view of their request for detailed curricula the Iranian Government would not be ready to issue a licence to this doctor until these had been received; but they rather surprisingly made no difficulties, and subsequently stated that they were now prepared to recognise the diplomas of both the above bodies. It was felt, however, that despite such an illogical proceeding it was still desirable to furnish them with the full curricula of the then non-recognised bodies in the United Kingdom, and the matter was accordingly referred to the General Medical Council, as also the Iranian enquiry as to the attitude which would be adopted in the United Kingdom towards diplomas of the Faculty of Medicine in Tehran. The question of the recognition of diplomas issued by certain institutions in the Dominions, and that of the reciprocal recognition of the I eh ran diploma were similarly referred to the Dominions concerned. 130. As regards diplomas issued in India, the only institutions hitherto recognised by the Iranian Government were the Universities of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras. TTis Majesty s Legation accordingly forwarded to the Ministry for Foreign Affaiis in June a full list of the universities, State medical faculties and examination boards, the holders of whose qualifications were entitled to practise in India. To this the Iranian Government replied by asking which of these qualifications entitled their holders to practise in the United^ Kingdom The matter was referred to the Foreign Office and the Government of India and instructions were received at the end of the year to furnish the Iranian Govern ment with the required information. 131. The Iranian Government agreed in January to the request put forward the previous year that doctors temporarily attached to His Majesty's consulates f!!°d. ie exempted from the necessity of obtaining a medical licence, provided that their stay did not exceed four months and that their attendance was confined to consular employees. (13) Legation Property. 132. Final agreement was reached with the municipality in January with regard to the terms on which His Majesty’s Legation were prepared to cede approximately 3,450 square metres of land on the east side of the Legation for the purposes of street widening. The municipality agreed to nav the sum of 724,470 rials (about £8,000 at the then rate of exchange) and toUrry ou“ a their own expense the construction of a new watercourse and pavement while the Legation undertook to demolish the existing wall and bufld anew one 0^ property 63 ^ ° f thiS and a11 ° ther rebuil dihg operations wdhUthe29 133. Work accordingly began in the spring, and although there was at one time in the summer an acute shortage of skilled workmen, the new consulate, new wall and new gate-house, and the reconstruction of the oriental secretary’s and military attache’s houses, were all completed before the bad weather set in in December. It then only remained for the municipality to asphalt the street outside and build a new pavement and watercourse. (14) Legation Wireless. 134. An official of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs told the oriental secretary to His Majesty’s Legation in March that he understood that the British news was still being distributed to outside persons, whereas His Majesty’s Legation had definitely agreed that the news should only be circulated inside the Legation. It was at once pointed out to him that, so far from His Majesty’s Legation having ever agreed to discontinue the circulation of their wireless bulletins, Sir Reginald H. Hoare had informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the end of 1934 (see paragraph 357 of the annual report for that year) that the Persian Legation in London had every right to distribute the bulletins of the Pars Agency, and that he trusted that the Persian Government would behave in a reciprocal manner towards His Majesty’s Legation. To this note no reply had ever been received. Later, M. Motamedy admitted that what Mr. Trott had said was correct, but he then proceeded to argue that the Legation had misunderstood the attitude of the Iranian Government, which was that, while foreign missions might possess receiving sets with the permission of the Iranian Government, and on condition of reciprocity, they might not distribute any news received on their sets, though it remained open to them to send to the Pars Agency any items of news which they considered of interest. M. Motamedy went on to say that, in view of the position in London, it was an understood thing that His Majesty’s Legation could possess a receiving set, and that no objection would be raised if copies of the news were sent privately to leading British subjects, such as the manager of the Imperial Bank of Iran, but the news must not be sent to clubs or to other foreign missions, nor might it be sold to subscribers. 135. Shortly after these conversations had taken place, M. Kazemi, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, was removed from office, and as there was reason to believe that he had been personally responsible for this renewed attack on the distribution of the British news, it was decided to accede to M. Motamedy’s request only to the extent of sending out the news in sealed envelopes instead of in wrappers, and of inserting a caption to the effect that the news was for the personal information of the recipient only and might not be published or publicly displayed. The existing distribution was, however, maintained unchanged. A similar policy was pursued by the German Legation. 136. In the event nothing more was heard from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and M. Kazemi’s successor even told His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that he wxmld be interested to receive the wireless summaries of important speeches on foreign affairs delivered by His Majesty’s Ministers. During the course of the summer the text of a number of such speeches as received on the wireless was therefore communicated privately either to the Minister or to the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and it was generally found that a trans lation was published in the bulletins of the Pars Agency on the following day. On one occasion the news proved particularly useful, as the Pars Agency reported Sir Samuel Hoare as having said in a speech that war was inevitable, whereas the news showed that he had in fact said that it was criminal folly to assume that war was inevitable. His Majesty’s Legation were therefore able to issue an immediate correction. An important consequence of this incident was that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs then asked that the text of important speeches by Ministers should be sent by the Legation to the Pars Agency, so that the latter would always be able to publish an authoritative version. 137. An even more satisfactory position was achieved in September when, following on a change of directors of the Pars Agency, the new director intimated that he would be glad to receive the British news daily in return for the bulletins of the Pars Agency, of which the Legation received a complimentary copy. Thereafter the British news was sent regularly to the Pars Agency, and though [15259] ^ b 15 /30 the latter did not reproduce it in extenso in their own bulletins, they frequently incorporated substantial extracts from it, and showed on more than one occasion that they set much store by it. 138. As, moreover, the Legation by a policy of reducing their subscription rates had succeeded during the course of the year in considerably increasing the number of their subscribers, and as the Iranian Government readily gave their consent to the importation of a new set to replace the existing one, which was obsolete and might become unserviceable at any moment, the position at the close of the year was more satisfactory than it had been at any time since 1934. (15) Consular Affairs. 139. Despite continual reminders, it proved impossible to obtain any definite reply from the Ministry for Foreign Afiairs in regard to the proposed redefinition of British consular districts in Iran (see paragraph 245 of the annual report for 1933). 140. Some progress was at last made in regard to the purchase of land at Ahwaz for a consulate, a matter which had been under consideration for many years. The difficulty hitherto had been that a dispute existed in regard to the ownership of the land which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom desired to acquire, and the land could obviously not be purchased without a guarantee that a valid title was being acquired at the same time. In April, how ever, the Ministry for Foreign Afiairs informed His Majesty’s Legation that the Iranian Government did not recognise the concession in virtue of which the supposed landlord held the property, but that negotiations might be conducted uir? cfc with the Ministry of Finance. The latter Ministry 'would make no difficulties about the sale of the land and would guarantee the transaction. In December His Majesty’s Minister was instructed to enquire the price asked for the whole site and for a smaller area, which it was thought might prove sufficiently large, and to endeavour to obtain a definite assurance that the whole site was still available. Discussions with the Ministry of Finance were still in progress at the end of the year. 144 ‘ • T { 1 i e Isfahan consulate-general was sold i a year for a total period31 of about two months. When he was not in residence the house could be used as a rest-house by British visitors with the approval of His Majesty’s Legation or His Majesty’s consul at Shiraz. Mr. Gault, the acting British consul at Shiiaz, spent a month at Isfahan in the autumn, and much useful information was gathered about a district of growing importance with which His Majesty’s Legation had for some years been rather out of touch. (16) British Cultural Propaganda. 145. Any form of British propaganda in this country must of necessity be undertaken with great caution, thus, while modest progress was made during the year under review in the field of cultural propaganda, there is nothing spectacular to report. 146. I he British Council undertook to present books to the value of £50 to four libraries in lehran, and, though it cannot be sard that the librarians exeicised much thought in the preparation of their lists of books, there is ample evidence that the British Council’s offer was much appreciated. Arrangements were also made to supply free of charge a number of periodicals to seven different institutions in this country, including the Church Missionary Society College at Isfahan and the American College at Tehran. At the same time certain technical periodicals were sent to the Radio Department of the Ministry of Posts and I elegraphs and to the School of Agriculture at Karadj. Another gift that was much appi eciated was that of a number of gramophone records of lectures in English. The British Council supplied thirty-three different lectures, and the records were handed over to the Department of English Language and Literature of the University of lehran. I he Minister of Education, who was present when the first selection of records was played over, showed great interest in the matter and the dean of the faculty of letters later wrote to say that the records were proving of considerable value. 147. The British Council also presented five prizes to the Church Missionary Society College at Isfahan and Kerman, and ofiered to make them a o-ift 0 f twenty-five lecture gramophone records, an offer which was gratefully accepted. 7 148- In another field mention may also be made of the fact that the Journal de Teheran published for a short while in the spring the Empire programmes of the Biitish Broadcasting Corporation. Publication then ceased as abruptly as it had begun, but in the autumn the new director of the Pars Ao-ency showed considerable interest in the matter, and, doubtless as a result of his efforts the Journal de Teheran began once more in December to publish the programmes (B) Canada. 149. Mr. Henri Turcot, who was appointed in the summer Canadian Hoyernment trade Commissioner in a number of Near Eastern countries naid a visit to Tehran in November. ’ ' (C) Iraq. (1) General. 150. Irano-Iraqi relations in 1936 were concerned almost exclusively with one aspect or another of the frontier question and the cognate problem of the future regime on the Shatt-el-Arab. The year 1935 had ended stormily; in 1936 the storm did not break, but foul weather continued and more than once the sky was menacing. In 1935 the principal centre of negotiation was Geneva; through out 1936 it was Bagdad, whither an Iranian delegation had proceeded °in December 1935. eh i 5 . 1 ' At ^e year the degree of British participation in the future control of the river took pride of place in discussions between His Majesty s Minister and M. Kazemi, the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs. In course of a conversation in the last week of 1935 M. Kazemi had asserted that while at Geneva m September the Secretary of State had assented to hisswm -.r 32 suggestion that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom need not be a signatory of the convention setting up a Conservancy Board, and that it would be sufficient that a dual Irano-Iraqi Convention should provide that the representative of a third Power, Great Britain, should sit on the Conservancy Commission. His Majesty’s Minister began the new year by putting clearly on record in a private letter to M. Kazemi that this was wholly inaccurate. His letter emphasised that from the outset His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had made it clear to the Iranian and Iraqi Governments alike that they attached the utmost importance to being a party to the proposed convention. 152. A few days later, Dr. Naji-al-Asil, the counsellor to the Iraqi Legation, who became in November Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, made a confidential communication to His Majesty’s Legation as to the course of negotiations in Bagdad. Throughout the year, be it said, the Iraqi and British Legations kept in close touch, and the Iraqi Minister persistently complained that he was starved of information by his own Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Bagdad. 153. Dr. Naji’s report was that the Iranian delegation in Bagdad were trying to get equal rights with Iraq in the Shatt-el-Arab, and to saddle Iraq with responsibility for keeping the British out of participation in a River Convention. The Iraqi Government had replied with an official offer ol a treaty on the basis of the 1914 frontier, coupled with two alternatives : Either all out standing matters, including the frontier, should be settled in accordance with the desire of the Shah, i.e., the 1914 frontier, but with an anchorage at Abadan, leaving a Navigation Convention, if Iran objected to British participation, to be raised at a more convenient time; or, the Iranian Government should inform His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom that they were opposed to British participation in a Navigation Convention. This latter alternative implied to Dr. Naji a break-off of negotiations seeing that Iraq was committed to British participation. The Iraqi Government were seeking, through Angora, Turkish diplomatic assistance at Tehran. 154. On the 12th January M. Kazemi had a lengthy conversation with His Majesty’s Minister. M. Kazemi expressed the wish that His Majesty’s Govern ment in the United Kingdom would take a more active part. Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen said that the Conservancy Convention seemed the key to a solution, and made the following suggestion on that aspect: M. Kazemi should first assure him that the Iranian Government would accept the principle of a Tripartite Conservancy Convention and agree to negotiations on this basis. Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen would then arrange that it should be put to the Iraqi Government that they should take the initiative in asking the Iranian Government to accept the above principle and to negotiate on that basis. In return the Iraqi Government would accept the principle of an Iranian anchorage at Abadan and would negotiate the necessary agreement. Sir Hughe Knatchbull- Hugessen believed that if progress were made on these points the rest would be relatively easy. M. Kazemi thought that there should further be an assurance that negotiations would proceed on a large number of other points under discussion between Iraq and Iran, including a treaty already initialled for non aggression and another for the pacific settlement of disputes. Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen said that he was sure that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would do all they could to assist on a basis of complete impartiality between Iran and Iraq. M. Kazemi promised to consult the Council of Ministers and the Shah and to communicate the result as soon as possible. 155. M. Kazemi mentioned at the same time some other points of importance : — (a) He was adamant that the Iranian Government could not agree to the inclusion of Karun and Bahmanshir waters under the Conservancy Board. He finally said that his Government would agree to administer those waters in co-operation with the Board. (b) The extent of the Abadan anchorage was a matter for experts, and his Government would accept whatever was technically necessary. (c) Anti-smuggling and sanitation arrangements on the river required to be settled. (d) Iran would accept the whole 1914 land and river frontier with the rectification at Abadan, but “ 1914 ” must not be mentioned.33 156. Of the above, point (a) was subsequently regarded by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Iraqi Government alike for political and technical reasons as so serious a stumbling block as virtually to knock the bottom out of the British draft convention, and the alternative of co-operation suggested as a compromise was never pursued by either side in more than a desultory manner throughout the year. 157. On point (b) the Persian Government shortly changed their ground, and as regards width insisted on being conceded half the river or at least the thalweg. 158. They maintained in support of their claim that Nuri Pasha had personally agreed to an anchorage “as at Mohammerah ’’ in his interview with the Shah at Tehran. 159. The above interview was quickly followed up. Four days later, on the 16th January, M. Kazemi sent for His Majesty’s Minister again and informed him that the Iranian Government were now willing to accept the principle of a Tripartite Conservancy Convention, but that they must receive a definite approach from the Iraqi Government in the point. In return the Iranian Govern ment desired the assistance of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom on expediting the subsequent negotiations for a final settlement of all outstanding questions with Iraq; and he wished an understanding to this effect to be kept secret between the Iranian Government and His Majesty’s Government. Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen stated explicitly that His Majesty’s Government could not take sides against Iraq, but that they were quite ready to assist in expediting the negotiations. M. Kazemi said that he despaired of bringing the Iraqis to any concrete result unless His Majesty’s Government brought some pressure upon them. 160. M. Kazemi then produced the French text of a document headed “ Base d’Accord,” embodying wdiat he had been saying; and he suggested that he and His Majesty’s Minister should initial it together at once and that it would form a Gentleman’s agreement between them. The document made the arrange ments for reaching agreement as to British participation in the Conservancy Convention conditional upon agreement being reached on no less than ten other questions of major or minor importance, including besides the frontier and anchorage issue the signature of the treaties of non-aggression and for the pacific settlement of disputes. A further condition was that all the agreements that the document covered must be concluded by March 1936 so that they might be signed in April. 161. Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen told M. Kazemi that he saw no great object in initialling this document, but that he would ask the Foreign Office for urgent instructions on it to reach him if possible before his parting audience with the Shah two days later. M. Kazemi concluded the interview by saying that he now expected to receive from the Iraqi Government a communication to the effect that they found it in their interest to have a Tripartite Conservancy Convention formed from Iraq, Iran and Great Britain and enquiring whether the Iranian Government agreed to this in principle. The latter would express concurrence and negotiations would follow as indicated in the document he had communicated. M. Kazemi added the warning that there were many points in the British draft for a Conservancy Convention to which the Iranian Government would raise objection. 162. On the same day M. Kazemi made a communication on similar lines to the Iraqi Minister. The latter and Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen agreed that the best procedure would be for M. Khalid Suleiman to receive from his Govern ment instructions to approach the Iranian Government in the sense suggested by M. Kazemi. The Iraqi Minister was anxious that His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad should have commended this line to the Iraqi Government before his own commendation reached them from Tehran. 163. While reporting home and to Bagdad in the above sense, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen added his comments on M. Kazemi’s “ Base d’Accord.” He saw little object in initialling the document proposed by M. Kazemi beyond the desirability of avoiding discouragement to him now that he had got so far. On34 the other hand he saw certain objections to it chiefly as identifying I is aj es y s Government in the United Kingdom too closely, and possibly too muc on e Persian side, with various matters which were not their direct concern e suggested that he should write privately to M. Kazemi to the eiiect tna Mis Majesty’s Government did not feel able to authorise him to initial the document, first because it identified His Majesty’s Government too closely with tie nom . aggression pact, and secondly, because it made them accept some measure ot responsibility in matters not their direct concern; he would add, however, that His Majesty’s Government fully agreed to the procedure M. Kazemi had proposed as regards the Tripartite Convention, and were prepared to assure M. Kazemi that the Iranian Government’s point of view on the other matters would be borne in mind and that they would assist both parties to the utmost of then power in reaching a settlement of outstanding questions. 164. The next event was His Majesty’s Minister s interview with the Shah before proceeding on leave. Acting on a suggestion from the Foreign Office, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen handed to the Shah, to the unconcealed annoyance of M. Kazemi, who was present, a brief summary of the British draft proposals for a convention. The Shah remarked that he had already accepted the principle, but, on coming to the passage providing for the inclusion of Karun and Bahmanshir waters, said that he would not agree to this. His Majesty remained obdurate in the face of His Majesty’s Minister’s explanation that His Majesty s Government did not see how the convention could work unless there was unity &lt; of control over all the relevant waterways. The Shah, did, however, say that he was perfectly willing to co-ordinate the management of the Karun with that of the Shatt-el-Arab and to follow advice given by the Tripartite Commission, though Iranians must themselves do the work and have the control of their own waters. After the interview M. Kazemi confirmed that the Iranian Government were willing to act on the advice of the Shatt-el-Arab Commission with regard to the Karun, but that was as far as they could go. Sir Hughe Knatchbull- Hugessen explained the lack of logic in their attitude, inasmuch as they were expecting concessions from the Iraqi Government in the Shatt-el-Arab and would give nothing in return in the Iranian waters that formed an indivisible part of the same problem. 165. The audience with the Shah was followed immediately by the receipt of the views of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom as regards the basis of agreement proposed by M. Kazemi. They did not think it necessary to urge the Iraqi Government to invite the Iranian Government to agree to British participation in a River Convention because Yasin Pasha had assured His Majesty’s Ambassador in Bagdad that he had insisted on this in a conversation with the Iranian Minister there. The motives behind M. Kazemi’s suggestion that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom should take the initiative in this and other Irano-Iraqi questions were considered obscure and intended to serve some ulterior purpose. Stress was laid on the importance of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom not being placed in a position where their desire to secure a Conservancy Convention could be represented as having interfered with the conclusion of a direct Irano-Iraqi agreement on the frontier question, though His Majesty’s Government still considered that the conclusion of a convention was the best course in the interest of all concerned. Moreover, from what M. Kazemi had said, the Iranian Government were likely to object to many essential provisions of the draft convention so that acceptance by him of the principle of full British participation might no longer be enough to overcome the difficulties of the situation. In any case a bargain of the type proposed was inacceptable and inappropriate. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom adhered to the promise given by Sir R. Clive that they would use their good offices with both parties to bring about a satisfactory general settlement but they could not go further and give undertakings as regards the conclusion of agreements to which they would not be parties and with which they were not concerned. His Majesty’s Minister was instructed to reply on the above lines, making clear that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom did not wish the solution of the future control of the river to delay a frontier settlement. Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen might also offer to communicate to the Iraqi Government the Iranian Government’s desiderata as outlined to him by M. Kazemi.35 166. His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad expressed similar suspicion as to M. Kazemi’s suggestion. Were His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom to fall in with it he feared that M. Kazemi would show it to the Iraqi Government and thereby destroy the latter’s confidence in His Majesty s Govern ment. Sir Archibald Clark-Kerr considered as fantastic the long list of subjects, some of them controversial, on which M. Kazemi wished agreement to be reached before the end of March, and he reported the Iraqi Prime Minister as holding the strong view that the frontier dispute must be settled in advance of all others. 167. His Majesty’s Minister replied to M. Kazemi's offer in accordance with his instructions in a private letter dated the 20th January. On the same day M. Kazemi told the Turkish Ambassador that he was awaiting a definite approach from the Iraqi Government on the subject of the Tripartite River Convention; and on the 20th January also His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad telegraphed that the Iraqi Prime Minister had told him that he thought M. Kazemi’s proposals, received in substantially the same form from the Iraqi Minister in Tehran, marked considerable progress. Yasin Pasha proposed to invite the Iranian Government to agree to full British participation in the River Convention, but only after he and the Minister for Foreign Affairs had discussed the scope of the powers to be given to the board. 168. Until the 20th January therefore there had been considerable activity on the party of His Majesty’s representatives in Bagdad and Tehran. On the following day, the 21st January, His Majesty’s Government in the United King dom sent important instructions to both capitals. From recent telegrams from these two posts the conclusion was drawn that there was little or no prospect of a speedy conclusion of any Shatt-el-Arab agreement on lines resembling even remotely the draft British convention. His Majesty’s Government no doubt felt that neither the Iraqi nor the Iranian Government had really thought out or faced the difficulties that the document was designed to overcome. The course therefore recommended to His Majesty’s representatives was to abstain from discussing various alternative expedients, at any rate until the position was clearer or serious proposals had been worked out by the two parties in detail. His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran replied expressing the hope that Sir Archibald Clark Kerr was still authorised to communicate the Iranian Government’s desiderata if the latter desired it; and that steps should still be taken to promote a definite confirmation of acceptance in principle both of the Tripartite Conservancy Board and of an anchorage for Iran at Abadan, in order to set negotiations in motion. Two further telegrams were received from the Foreign Office restating the policy indicated in the telegram of the 21st January, but saying that this did not debar the proposed communication of the Iranian Government’s desiderata to the Iraqi Government by Flis Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad if the Iranian Government desired it. The latter did not in fact pursue this point. No direct answer was sent to Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen’s other suggestion, and at no time during the year did the Iraqi Govemment bring themselves to propose to the Iranian Government in writing full British participa tion in a Conservancy Convention. 169. A few days later copies reached Bagdad and Tehran of a memorandum of instructions for the guidance of His Majesty’s Ambassador in negotiating a Conservancy Convention. These emphasised as essential that both the convention and the commission or board that it set up must be tripartite, excluding all nationalities other than Iraqi, Iranian and British, and that the United Kingdom must be in all respects on precisely the same footing as the other two countries. 170. British good offices between the two Governments remained, in fact, largely in abeyance for the rest of the year. The Iranian Ministry for Foreign Affairs made two further bids for the assistance of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. On the 5th February M. Kazemi sent the British Charge d’Affaires a letter modifying his original “ Base d’Accord ” by reducing the large number of agreements to be concluded within a specified date down to the two or three treaties which were of the greatest urgency and which were to be regarded as the basis of agreement, while the remainder should be postponed to a subsequent time in the near future. M. Kazemi explained, in conversation, that the frontier and Shatt-el-Arab settlements and the treaty of friendship were the urgent questions, and he thought that these could be concluded before the May meeting of36 the Council. His letter ended with an obscure reference to article 1 of theAnglo- Iraqi Treaty of 1930, which M. Kazemi hoped afforded His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom a locus standi for influencing the Iraqi Government on questions of foreign policy even if His Majesty’s Government were not directly concerned in them. 171. M. Kazemi’s offer, as revised, did not differ essentially from the original, and His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was instructed to send a polite reply emphasising the formidable nature of the detailed work required in con nexion with a settlement of the Shatt-el-Arab and urging that the Iranian and Iraqi Governments should get down to detail. He was further to repeat that His Majesty’s Government did not desire a settlement of the frontier dispute to be held up by a decision as to the future control of the river, essential though this last would be to a satisfactory final settlement. 172. Meanwhile, the Iranian delegation which went to Bagdad in December was maintaining desultory negotiations with the Iraqi Ministers. Part of February was occupied with efforts to redescribe the land frontier from north to south to meet the Iranian wishes, instead of from south to north as in the 1913-14 protocol. In March Colonel Ward, Director of the Port of Basra, at the request of the Iraqi Government, first visited the river between Khorramshahr and Abadan Reach with Colonel Bayendor of the Iranian navy, with a view to joint recommen dations as to the size of the anchorage and then enumerated for the Iraqi Government’s benefit many points arising in connexion with the navigation and conservancy of the river. 173. On receiving these, Yasin Pasha communicated to the Iranian delega tion a list of the reservations he would have to attach to the cession of an anchorage. They included a provision that the part of the Shatt-el-Arab forming, the anchorage should remain open in all circumstances of peace and war for navigation of the ships of all nations and for the free passage of all warships belonging to Iraq and her allies. 174. The Iranian delegation produced in reply a new draft treaty, principal features of which were— (1) A waterfront at Abadan from the northern part of Shutait island to No. 1 jetty, extending to the medium filum aquce. (2) A provision for the free passage of Persian warships from the sea to the mouth of the Khaiyun Canal. (3) The omission of all mention of a board to control either navigation or conservancy. (4) Provisions for an Irano-Iraqi commission to delimit the land frontier. 175. Shortly afterwards, on the 22nd March, the day after the Persian New Year, M. Samiy, Iranian Minister in Bagdad and head of the delegation there, left hurriedly for Tehran to replace M. Kazemi as Minister for Foreign Affairs. The precise reasons for M. Kazemi’s fall are obscure, but it seems very probable that among them was his failure to present the Shah with any substantial progress in relations with Iraq. Anxiety to be able to do so was, it can hardly be doubted, an important reason for M. Kazemi having tried so hard to enlist the help of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom towards speeding up some conclusions. 176. On the 1st April the Iraqi Government communicated hurriedly and without consulting any British adviser except Colonel Ward a counter-draft to the agreement proposed by the Iranians, which in various ways was not satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, who therefore reserved their right to comment later. Both the drafts were, however, rendered out-of-date by a telegram from M. Samiy in Tehran repudiating any official validity for his own draft. Shortly afterwards the whole Iranian delegation were withdrawn from Bagdad. Before they left a member of it visited His Majesty’s Ambassador and said°that they had made it clear to the Iraqis that what they wanted were {a) an anchorage at Abadan on the same terms as the water at Mohammerah, and (b) a Tripartite Conservancy Board to control the Shatt, but not the Karun and Bahmanshir. They were still waiting for Iraq to propose British participation in the negotiations. in37 177. The withdrawal of the Iranian delegation did not indicate a rupture of negotiations, which were continued through the diplomatic channel. M. Samiy described to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires the two chief difficulties as having been Iraqi inability to agree to concede either the median line opposite Abadan, or equal rights on certain matters concerning the river. M. Samiy repeated that if a commission to control the river materialised his Government would agree to full British participation, but only if the Iraqi Government formally proposed it. He wished that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would take a more active line and help promote a solution of the two difficulties mentioned before the May meeting of the Council of the League. If the Iraqis insisted on retaining entire control of Abadan, the Iranian Government might be compelled to develop the Bahmanshir. His Excellency further made it clear that the Iranian Government intended to claim sovereignty over all or part of the Rooka Channel where the Shatt-el-Arab debouches into the Persian Gulf. 178. About this time His Majesty’s representatives at Bagdad and Tehran became the repositories of the conflicting accounts from Iraqi and Iranian Ministers. Each side complained that the other would not respond to frankness and would not come to grips. Yasin Pasha continued to assure Sir Archibald Clark Kerr that he was insisting upon full British participation in the River Commission, while the Iranian delegation on return to Tehran told His Majesty’s Legation that Yasin Pasha had always been averse to the British participating, and the Iraqi Minister in Tehran asserted freely that his own Ministers were obstructing. 179. M. Samiy’s successor in Bagdad continued to carry on the negotiations, with even less result, until on the 23rd June Nuri Pasha, with a view, he said, to bringing the Iranians into the open, addressed him a note setting out his Govern ment’s views as follows :— As regards a Navigation Commission, this should consist of three members; Iraq was pledged to the third member being British, but Great Britain was insisting also on signing the instrument setting up the com- ' mission. What was the Iranian Government’s view in regard to this demand ? Such a commission could have powers (a) purely over navigation, including lighting, buoying and pilotage; or (b) it could cover dredging and river maintenance also. If so, it would for technical reasons require control of the Bahmanshir and part of the Karun also. The Iranian Government were invited to accept one or other of the above forms of commission so that the Iraqis could invite the United Kingdom Government to discuss the matter and so finally dispose of it. But it would not be reasonable for the Iranians to demand a share in controlling water belonging exclusively to Iraq, and at the same time to exclude the corresponding Iranian waters. But the Iraqi note envisaged the further possibility that the commission could be given advisory powers on matters under category (b), it being left to the discretion of the two Governments to act on this advice. If none of the above arrangements found favour with the Iranian Government, let them abandon the idea of a River Commission and be satisfied with the cession of an anchorage at Abadan. 180. On receipt of this note the Iranian Minister in Bagdad, who on the 19th June had asked His Majesty’s Ambassador to make an effort to find a settle ment, called upon the counsellor to the British Embassy, who was by then Charge d’Affaires. M. Aalam was aggrieved at the language used in the note, and at its omission of any reference to the agreement which he asserted had been reached to the effect that the anchorage at Abadan should be 4 miles in length. Mr. Bateman discounted this omission, pointing out that the Iraqi note was meant to clear the air on principle, not in details, and proceeded to some plain speaking as to the unreasonableness of the Iranian attitude. He used the occasion to contradict a story which the Minister had been putting about to the effect that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would have no objection to an agreement a deux between the Iraqi and Iranian Governments, even if it included questions concerning the future regime on the Shatt-el-Arab. M. Aalam left the interview with a veiled threat that, unless the Iraqi attitude were more forthcoming, serious consequences would follow.181. From this point on the Iranian Government virtually ceased to ask the help of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, and in the course of a conversation a fortnight later about the Iraqi note the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs told His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that his Government no longer regarded themselves as bound by M. Kazemi’s offer to agree to full British ^ participation in a Tripartite River Convention if the Iraqis proposed it. Ihis offer had been subject to the further condition that His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom should help to secure certain settlements before the end of March and had now lapsed. This assertion was strictly correct, but the offer had since been modified in oral statements by M. Kazemi, and even after the May meeting of the League Council Iranian Ministers had spoken on various occasions as though the offer was conditioned only on the Iraqi Government inviting the Iranian Government to agree. In a later conversation, M. Samiy asked Mr. Butler what response he would advise to the Iraqi note. Mr. Butler expressed the view that the principles that it offered could be made to meet all Iran's practical difficulties, and that the Iranian Government therefore would do well to accept it as a basis. 182. About the same time, the Iranian Government lodged an official protest with the Iraqi Government against the latter’s independent action in giving powers as regards quarantine formalities for ships in the Shatt-el-Arab to a station at Fao; they alleged that these infringed Iran’s sovereignty over the river and disturbed the status quo contrary to undertakings given by Nuri Pasha at Geneva in January 1935. 183. The Iraqi Government also learnt that the Iranians had established two further police posts on the Iraqi side of the frontier in Northern Iraq. They asked for the advice of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom on these developments. 184. Without, however, awaiting this advice the Iraqi Government sent two notes in reply to the Iranian complaint. The first contested the Iranian claim to possess sovereign rights in the Shatt-el-Arab. The second defended the Iraqi Government’s action in enforcing the new quarantine measures at Fao, and f concluded with a reference to the renewed aggressions involved in the erection of Iranian police posts on the Iraqi side of the land frontier. 185. At this time there seemed various reasons for anticipating that the Iranian Government would pursue such an aggressive policy during the autumn on the land frontier and the river that incidents would be provoked. Happily these anticipations were not fulfilled. On the contrary, Iranian policy thereafter seemed to be rather to show correctness towards Iraq, and the Iranian Minister in Bagdad stated in September that he had instructions to avoid any unpleasant ness. The object perhaps was to secure a direct settlement of the land and river questions without British participation, intervention or subsequent claim in respect of diplomatic services rendered. 186. After this interlude, the Iranian Government replied on the 18th August to the Iraqi note of the 23rd June. They agreed to a Mixed Irano- Iraqi Commission to control conservancy and navigation, having a third member nominated by another Government on the invitation of both. Their note con tested the right of any third party to participate in or sign the agreement estab lishing the commission, and invited the Iraqi Government to state their views more clearly as regards British participation. The note rejected the inclusion of waters of the Karun and Bahmanshir in the scope of the commission’s operations and challenged the right of the Iraqi Government to act independently in the Shatt-el-Arab. The note proceeded to indicate six essential points as regards administration of the river : these included requirements that it should be open without discrimination to the merchant ships of all nations, and that the warships of Iran and Iraq should be free to pass and anchor anywhere in it; also that the dues collected should be appropriate to services rendered, and not exceed the total cost of conservancy. 187. Nuri Pasha informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that in com municating the above note the Iranian Minister, on instructions from Tehran, added verbally {a) that his Government’s original agreement to British partici pation had lapsed in March, (b) that the anchorage at Abadan must be 4 kilom.39 in length and extend to the medium filum aquae, and (c) that the Rooka Channel belonged to Iran. Nuri Pasha stated further that the Persian Minister asked him also to sustain Iran’s claim to Bahrein. 188. Nuri Pasha apologised to Mr. Bateman for the weak wording of his note of the 23rd June as regards British participation in the control of the river, and promised that his next note to the Iranian Government would make the position of his Government clear on this point. In the event Nuri Pasha was forced by a coup d'Etat to leave Iraq before a further note was sent. His successor did not avail himself of a draft of Mr. Edmonds’s; his note relegated control of the river to a later stage of negotiations, and contained no mention of British participation. 189. At this juncture the Iranian Minister in London, who was just leaving London on holiday, wrote an injudicious letter to the Secretary of State instead of making an oral communication, as his Government had intended. The letter complained of the intransigence and delays of the Iraqi negotiations, and suggested that unwarranted and unnecessary British insistence on full participa tion in the River Commission was facilitating Iraqi obstruction. There was a further provocative reference to the agreement that M. Kazemi had alleged in the previous December that he had reached with the Secretary of State at Geneva in September, and which Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen had categorically denied on the Secretary of State’s behalf. In replying to M. Ala’s letter the Secretary of State restated the position created by the refusal of the Iranian Government to recognise as valid the instrument by which their frontier with Iraq had been laid down in the past. His letter emphasised that the Iraqi Government had offered international arbitration on this legal issue, and that the Iranian Government had declined it; as long as the latter adhered to this refusal the frontier between the two countries must be assumed to be that which had existed before the Great War between Turkey and Persia. The letter then turned from the judicial side to the practical difficulties in the Shatt-el-Arab, and criticised the attitude of the Iranian Government both in objecting to British participation in the Tripartite Convention and in asserting that this was a fresh demand on the part of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom; also in refusing to include waters of the Karun and Bahmanshir in the scope of the commission, seeing that these waters and the Shatt-el-Arab formed a single problem which should be dealt with by unified control. On this point, moreover, the Iraqi note of the 23rd June had contained an alternative suggestion which had been ignored. The Secretary of State’s reply ended by denying the incorrect account given by M. Kazemi of the conversation at Geneva in September 1935, and by expressing the earnest desire that the Iraqi note of the 23rd June would lead to a settlement satisfactory both to Iran and Iraq. 190. At this point the Non-Aggression Pact drafted in 1935 and already initialled on behalf of Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan began to assume more importance in connexion with Irano-Iraqi negotiations. The Turkish Ministry for Foreign Affairs and M. Kazemi had long wanted to proceed to signature of the treaty. The Iraqi Ministers, on the other hand, took the view that it was only logical to defer its signature until their frontier dispute with Iran had been amicably settled. In September Nuri Pasha and the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs reached some sort of understanding by which Turkish influence was to be used on the Shah in favour of a settlement of the frontier dispute, including an anchorage for Iran at Abadan and the signature of the Non-Aggression Pact before, or at latest by, April of the following year, the navigation and conservancy aspects of the river question being, if necessary, deferred to a later date. Nuri Pasha considered that Turkish help on the above lines placed Iraq in a strong tactical position vis-d-vis of Iran. 191. At the end of October Yasin Pasha and Nuri Pasha were driven from office and from Iraq by a coup d’Ttat. The former was succeeded as Prime Minister by Hikmat Suleiman, brother of the Iraqi Minister at Tehran, who had always been critical of the late Minister’s policy, and Nuri Pasha as Minister for Foreign Affairs, by Dr. Naji-al-Asil, who at the beginning of the year was counsellor to the Iraqi Legation and had echoed his Minister’s criticisms. Early40 in November the Iraqi Minister was anxious to suggest to his brother some new possible basis of settlement of the Irano-Iraqi dispute on lines not inacceptable to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, and he invited the Legation s informal assistance, but by this time Dr. Naji already had in hand a reply to the last Iranian note, and the Foreign Office informed His Majesty s Minister that in these circumstances he need add nothing to the non-committal answer that he had given to the Iraqi Minister’s advances. 192. Dr. Naji’s reply to the note of the 18th August followed the lines of what Nuri Pasha had agreed with the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs. It proposed that a treaty should be concluded embodying the existing frontier with a rectification in the shape of an anchorage at Abadan ceded by Iraq, and an agreement to continue negotiations regarding control of navigation and con servancy in the Shatt. Dr. Naji told His Majesty’s Ambassador that he hoped that the frontier question might thus be settled before March 1937 and the Non- Aggression Pact signed. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr reminded him that, until the navigation and conservancy problems had been settled, he should safeguard the freedom of all ships at all times to navigate the ceded anchorage, and Iraq s right to dredge it. Dr. Naji handed a note on the above lines to the Iranian Minister in Jiagdad on the 28th November; he gave a copy at the same time to the Turkish Minister, and asked that the proposals in it should be supported in 1 ehran by the Turkish Embassy. The note contained a phrase safeguarding freedom of navigation in peace and war through the anchorage ceded, but did not specify.by the ships of what countries this freedom should be enjoyed; nor did the stipulation that the signature of the treaty should be followed by negotiations for a river convention contain any reference to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom participating in this convention. 193. Thus by the end of the year the Iraqi Government had still not put in writing to the Iranian Government any phrase committing them to support full British participation in control of the river, but His Majesty^s Ambassador reported that Hikmat Suleiman and Dr. Naji (like Lasin Pasha and Nuri Pasha before them) had assured Mr. Edmonds that they regarded such participation as their only safeguard against Iranian trickery. 194. Assuming these assurances to be genuine, the relegation of the River Convention to a later stage became a question of tactical expediency, as regards which the views of Dr. Naji and the Foreign Office differed. The former had seemingly been converted to Yasin Pasha’s views that once the frontier question had been recognised the atmosphere would be much better for settling the regime on the river. The Foreign Office felt that the soundest course remained to aim at a comprehensive settlement and that the cession of an anchorage at Abadan would give away the strongest lever in Iraq’s hands for securing the Iranian Government’s acceptance of suitable conservancy arrangements. 195. Half-way through December the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Minister that, even if the Iranian Government went to the Hague Court and judgment were given against them, Iran would never acquiesce in the present situation on the Shatt, and he repeated that his Govern ment remained opposed to British participation in any convention respecting navigation or conservancy of the river. Mr. Seymour held out no hope of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom relaxing their insistence. M. Samiy thought a frontier settlement might be possible on the basis proposed in the latest Iraqi note, provided the size of the anchorage were satisfactory and that certain points as regards the regime on the river could be settled. At one point M. Samiy referred to the possibility that prolongation of discussions over these details might affect relations between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom^and the Iranian Government on other questions. 196. It will be seen from the above, and particularly by comparing the last Iraqi offer with that reported by Dr. Naji in the third paragraph of this section, that, although no deadlock had arisen, little progress had been made by the end of the year. It had been spent by the Iranian and Iraqi Governments mainly in wrangling over the size, and more especially the width, of the frontier rectification to be ceded in the form of an anchorage at Abadan; the inclusion or non-inclusion of certain waters of the Karun and Bahmanshir in the scope of the proposed River Commission, and in a somewhat mock-battle as to whether and in what41 capacity His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom should be represented on this commission and, failing such a commission, the rights on the river to be accorded to Iran. 197. This lack of progress accorded with the anticipations of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, who foresaw that, without British good offices, negotiations would stagnate, and believed that eventually British assistance would be invoked once more by both parties with a better prospect of its proving effective. 198. The most constant preoccupation of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had been to avoid being charged with responsibility for a break down. In this they were successful, but the formula used did not perhaps work in favour of what they regarded as the ideal solution, namely, a simultaneous settlement of frontier and future regime on the river, with full British participa tion in the latter. Thus, at the end of the year, the drift of negotiation seemed, if anything, towards the second best, a frontier settlement, with river administration relegated to a later stage of negotiation; and no agreement was in sight either as to the capacity, if any, in which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would be represented on the River Commission contemplated in a River Conven tion, or as to the method of avoiding duality of control during the period between the cession of an anchorage to Iran and the establishment of a River Commission. 199. The negotiations for a quadrilateral pact of non-aggression between Iran, Iraq, Turkey and Afghanistan are referred to in Section II (E) (2) below. (2) Agreements. 200. The Irano-Iraqi Provisional Agreement of December 1932 for the Settlement of Frontier Incidents, concluded in the form of an exchange of notes, was renewed for two further periods of six months from the 7th December, 1935, and the 7th June, 1936, respectively. (D) Other Countries. (1) Turkey. 201. Turco-Iranian relations remained excellent throughout the year. In January it was announced that the Pars and the Anatolia News Agencies had reached an agreement for the exchange of news between Iran and Turkey, and the Pars Agency published a message from the Turkish Prime Minister in which he expressed his conviction in ‘ ‘ the wisdom of a policy of even closer rapproche ment between Iran and Turkey.” 202. This rapprochement could be noted under several heads. Diplomatic ally the Turkish Ambassador was on close terms with the members of the Iranian Government and, more important, appeared to enjoy the confidence and even liking of the Shah. On more than one occasion he offered mediation and advice in connexion with the negotiations for the settlement of the Irano-Iraqi dispute and the Middle Eastern Pact of Non-Aggression, and there is no reason to suppose that he used his special position other than wisely and well. In Court circles his wife and daughters obtained a footing which no others had ever achieved, and were frequent visitors to the Queen and Princesses. In military matters the Turkish military attache enjoyed facilities not accorded to any of his colleagues. On the Iranian side the press were instructed to give whole hearted support to the Turkish case with regard to the remilitarisation of the Straits. 203. A Turkish mission under the leadership of M. Cemal Husnu, a Deputy and formerly Turkish Minister at Berne, came to Tehran in October in order to conclude with the Iranian Government a number of agreements on questions such as residence, judicial assistance, extradition, customs and consular matters. It is understood that one of the subjects of discussion was the possibility of developing trade on the Tabriz-Trebizond route. The mission was received most warmly, but its members complained of the dilatoriness of Iranian officials, and its labours were not even approaching conclusion at the end of the year.42 (2) Afghanistan. 204. The Irano-Afghan frontier dispute was finally settled during the year under review. The mixed commission which had been appointed in the previous autumn to give effect to the Turkish arbitral award (see paragraph 287 of the annual report for 1935) worked steadily during the early months of 1930 and ^ the task of erecting boundary pillars was concluded in May. Neither Iran nor Afghanistan showed much enthusiasm over the award itself, which satisfied the extravagant claims of neither; but with the passage of time both sides seemed to reach the view that it provided a reasonable settlement of the points m dispute. 205. A slight fracas arose at the end of July between villagers on the Iranian and Afghan sides of the frontier near Zabul over the distribution of the water of the Helmand River. A few people, including some Iranian frontier guards, were killed, and both the Iranian and the Aighan Governments moved small bodies of troops up to the frontier. There was no serious clash between them, however, and the incident was soon settled by the appointment of a joint commission of investigation. 206 His Highness Shah Mahmoud Khan, the Afghan Minister of War, accompanied by the Chief of the Afghan General Staff, paid a visit to Iran on his way back from Europe at the beginning of November. While in Tehran he was accommodated in one of the Royal palaces. He had audiences with the Shah and the Valiahd, and was made to go through an arduous programme of official calls and receptions. The Iranian Government spared no pains to make the visit a success, but there is no reason to suppose that it possessed any particular significance. (3) Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. 207. There is but little to say about Irano-Soviet relations during the year under review. The Minister for Foreign Affairs in a conversation with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires described them as being “ calmes et confiantes ” and, though it is possible to feel some doubt about the durability of the confiance, there seems no reason to contest the “ calme.” 208. The instruments of ratification of the following Irano-Soviet agree ments, all signed at Tehran on the 27th August, 1935, were exchanged at Moscow on the 8th June : Treaty of Establishment, Commerce and Navigation, Convention regarding Sanitary and Veterinary Questions, Convention providing Measures to^Prevent the Diseases of Plants, and Convention for the Combating of Locusts. 209. Under the above-mentioned Treaty of Commerce Iran undertook to supply the Soviet Union with important quantities of Iranian produce, particu larly raw wool and raw cotton, at agreed prices. It is understood that, partly as a result of the increasing requirements of Iranian industry, Iran fell badly behind in her deliveries and that at the end of the year a sum not far short of the equivalent of £1 million was awaiting transfer to the Soviet Union. The arrangement is not so satisfactory to Iran as appeared at the time of its condition, as the heavy demand for Iranian products from other countries, particularly Germany and Czechoslovakia which have also oversold to Iran, has caused a sharp increase in prices; prices and quantities for delivery to the Soviet Union are, however, fixed for the period of the treaty. 210. A frontier bridge across the Araxes, which was built jointly by Iran and the Soviet Union, was completed during the year. Its object was to connect Maku with the Julfa-Tiflis railway and to avoid the necessity of ferrying goods across the river. (4) Germany. 211. The year 1936 was one of intense German commercial activity in Iran. The Irano-German Clearing Agreement of the 30th October, 1935, was brought into force provisionally before the end of the year, though it was not ratified by the Majlis until the 6th September, 1936, and its provision that no Iranian import licence need be obtained in respect of goods imported from Germany gave German exporters an advantage of approximately 18 per cent, over all43 other countries, except the Soviet Union. German exports to Iran consequently showed a great increase during the year and trade with Iran was further consolidated by a substantial barter agreement concluded in the summer, whereby Germany agreed to export industrial material in return for wheat, rice and other Iranian products. 212. Nevertheless, considerable difficulties arose during the course of time. With her developing industries Iran found herself with a steadily decreasing quantity of raw materials which she was able to export, and at the same time she was obliged by treaty to export large quantities to the Soviet Union. It became, therefore, an impossible task for her to find sufficient quantities of goods to export to Germany in return for her imports from that country, and as a result the balance of payments arising out of the Clearing Agreement became badly upset in favour of Germany. It is not yet possible to give any exact figures, but a well-informed person estimated the sum owed by Iran at the end of the year to be in the region of 20 million marks. 213. The importance with which Germany regarded her trade with Iran was well shown by the visit of Dr. Schacht to Tehran in November. He remained for five days, two of which were virtually absorbed in travelling to and from Resht to have an audience with the Shah. Before he left Dr. Schacht informed the Italian Minister that the Clearing Agreement was working perfectly, but there is reason to suppose that the two chief objects of his visit were to explore the possibility of obtaining increased imports from Iran, and to secure the placing of still further orders for German material and contracts for German firms. So far as could be gathered, he seemed prepared to allow the Iranian Government plenty of time in which to liquidate their unfavourable balance of payments. It is believed that Dr. Schacht also discussed the question of a German air line through Iran. A three-engined Junkers monoplane with accommodation for ten passengers had arrived in Tehran at the beginning of July, had gone on to Kabul and had visited Tehran again on its return flight to Europe. It was generally understood that the object of the flight was to take meteorological and other observations and to prepare the way for the establishment of a regular civil air line, which would run from Bagdad to Tehran and from Tehran via Meshed and Herat to Kabul. Dr. Schacht is stated to have pursued the matter further and to have obtained the consent of the Iranian Government to the establishment of a regular service. 214. The number of Germans resident in Iran continued to increase during the year. The German colony in Tehran was estimated to have leached 450, and in Isfahan it grew in three years from about fifteen to fifty. It is understood that the German Government were, in fact, considering the opening of a consulate in this latter city. (5) Italy. 215. At the beginning of the year the Italian Legation in Tehran was very much on the defensive. The young Charge d’Affaires was bitter and depressed and the sympathies of Iran were certainly on the side of Abyssinia. Italian interests were, however, helped by the arrival in March of a new Italian Minister, Signor Andrea Geisser Celesia di Vegliasco, whose geniality and level-headedness did much to re-establish the position of the Legation. So far as is known his only noteworthy attempt at propaganda was to hold a large party m June for Iranians and members of his colony at which a Fascist film vyas shown which included scenes from the war in Abyssinia. A number of Iranians stated after wards that they had by no means appreciated being expected to applaud the triumphs of Marshal Badoglio. While Signor Celesia by quieter methods and with the raising of sanctions did much to restore Irano-Italian relations to a footing of, at any rate, outward friendliness, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs remained extremely suspicious of Fascist ambitions in the Middle East. 216. An Italian naval attache arrived in June and remained in Tehran for the rest of the year, though he was officially gazetted as assistant naval attache at Angora Various rumours were current as to the reason for his appoint ment but it seemed that, whatever developments might emerge, the main object of the Italian Government was to ensure that the Italian navy should retain its position as godfather and tutor to the Iranian navy.217. The Italian Minister left Tehran in December to take up a new appointment in Rome, and the Legation was left in charge of a newly arrived first secretary. (6) France. 218. M. Jean Pozzi, the French Minister, went on leave in February and the Legation was left in charge of a Charge d’Affaires for the rest of the year. 219. Towards the end of the year Franco-Iranian relations were disturbed by a crop of articles about Iran in the French press. Ihe French Charge d’Affaires stated that one or two of them had been really malicious, and that, as the French press normally took no interest whatever in Iran, he could only conclude that this sudden campaign had been inspired, probably by Iranian emigres. Whatever the cause, the Iranian Government took CTeat offence and recalled their Minister from Paris. In contrast, however, to their action when they closed their Legation in Washington in the spring, they allowed no news of what had happened to leak out into the Iranian press. (7) The United States. 220. The strain in Irano-American diplomatic relations caused by the arrest of the Iranian Minister in Washington in November 1935 on a charge of exceeding the speed limit (see paragraph 310 of the annual report for 1935) was considerably aggravated in the early months of 1936. It was announced at the beginning of the year that the Iranian Minister had been recalled, and the Iranian press seized the occasion to launch an abusive attack on the American press, which had treated the misfortunes of M. Ghaffar Jelal in a manner that showed little consideration either for his feelings or the susceptibilities of his august master. It was later learned that the Shah was particularly offended by an article in the Hearst press, which described him as “ a former stable boy in the British Legation,” and, though the State Department succeeded in obtaining the publica tion of a dementi, the Shah remained unmollified, and it was announced at the beginning of April that the Iranian Government had decided to close their Legation in Washington and all their consulates in the United States. As a further measure of retaliation they put a ban on the entry into Iran of all American papers, and, though this was later relaxed in favour of scientific publications, at the end of the year a subscriber could still never be certain whether any given number of any paper would arrive or not. Even the American archaeological expedition, working at Ray and Persepolis, was made to suffer such tiresome restrictions that at the end of the year they were contemplating abandoning work in Iran altogether. 221. Mr. W. H. Hornibrook, the American Minister in Tehran, left for the United States in March to take part in President Roosevelt’s re-election campaign. No successor to him had been appointed by the end of the year. 222. Mr. C. C. Hart, the former American Minister in Tehran, paid a short visit to Iran in September on his way to Europe from Afghanistan, where he had been negotiating for an oil concession. He returned to Tehran again early in December, and stated, in private conversation shortly before the end of the year, that he was on the point of signing an oil concession with the Iranian Government. (8) Belgium. 223. The Belgian Legation remained throughout the year in the charge of a Charge d’Affaires. With the exception of the air mission, the fortunes of which are dealt with in Section IV (B) (10), Belgian interests remained almost solely commercial. (9) The Netherlands. 224. The Netherlands Harbour Works Company, which was engaged on the construction of the port of No Shahr on the Caspian, was understood to have obtained a larger contract in the autumn of 1935 for the enlargement of the port of Bandar Shahpur. This contract, however, fell through at the last moment and the whole scheme was shelved when the Iranian Government decided to effect a number of economies on the introduction of the exchange control system. Workon No Shahr continued throughout the year, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in the spring that Dutch engineers had prepared a scheme for developing the Bahmanshir. It is understood, however, that the events of the year considerably shook the confidence of Dutch commercial interests in the financial stability of Iran, and that at the end of the year they were no longer keen to obtain new contracts. (10) Norway. 225. The Norwegian Minister to Iran, who resides in Moscow, paid a short visit to Tehran in the spring. It is understood that the Iranian Government had commented on the fact that he had not been to this country since 1931, while he desired to discuss various commercial questions. (n) Sweden. 226. A resident Swedish Minister, Herr von Heidenstam, was accredited to Tehran in the autumn and presented his letters on the 27th October. The former Swedish Minister had resided elsewhere and only a Charge d’Affaires had been left in Tehran to look after the not inconsiderable Swedish commercial interests here. (12) Switzerland. 227. A Swiss Legation was established in Tehran in the summer in the charge of a Charge d’Affaires. No Swiss Minister was accredited here. (13) A ustria. 228. A Treaty of Friendship and Arbitration between Iran and Amstria was signed on the 23rd September at Angora, where the Austrian Minister accredited to Iran normally resides. (14) Roumania. 229. M. Gregoire Constantinesco presented his letters of credence as the first Roumanian Minister to Iran on the 10th March. He departed on leave in August, leaving the Legation in charge of a Charge d’Affaires, and had not returned by the end of the year. There are no Roumanian interests in Iran and, according to M. Constantinesco, the only reason for his appointment was that the Iranians had desired to establish a Legation in the Balkans and that M. Titulesco, who was anxious to see it at Bucharest rather than elsewhere, had been obliged to promise to set up a Roumanian mission at Tehran in return. (15) Greece. 230. A Greek delegation, consisting of three Government officials and led by the head of a Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, arrived in Tehran in December at the invitation of the Iranian Department of Agriculture. It is understood that the main object of this visit was to discuss the question of Greek technical assistance for the Iranian tobacco industry and that a proposal had been put forward to bring out 300 Greek families to work on the tobacco plantations along the Caspian seaboard. It was announced at about the same time that the Greek Government had decided to create a Greek Legation in Tehran, but the head of the delegation stated that it was quite likely that it might never come into being except on paper. He also said that his mission had achieved very little. (16) Japan. 231. The Japanese Minister, who had narrowly escaped assassination at the hands of his fanatical military attache in the summer, went on leave in November. It was understood that he would not be returning, and that the Legation would be left for some time in the hands of a Charge d’Affaires. (17) Egypt. 232. A new Minister, Abdul Rahman Azzam, presented his letters as Egyptian Minister on the 19th September. He left Tehran before the end of the year for Bagdad and Jedda, where he was also accredited.46 (18) The Yemen. 233. Seyed Muhammad Zubara, Minister of Court of the Yemen, paid a visit to Iran in August. He apparently came on his own initiative and, though he was well received in Tehran as a distinguished visitor, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs stated that no political significance was to be attached to his visit. (E) International. (1) League of Nations. 234. In 1935 M. Kazemi, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, attended the January, May and September sessions of the Council in connexion with the Irano-Iraqi dispute. In 1936, neither he nor his successor, M. Samiy, visited Geneva at all. 235. In September the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Tehran and the Iranian Minister in London drew attention to the proposal put forward by the Iranian Government at Geneva that a new non-permanent seat on the Council should be created and reserved for the States of the Near East. They asked that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom should support this proposal and the candidature of Iran as the first incumbent of the new seat. 236. A woman was included for the first time in the Iranian delegation to the Assembly. 237. The Iranian Government raised sanctions against Italy on the 15th July. The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs expressed to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires the view that the policy of His Majesty’s Govern ment in the United Kingdom had been right both in urging the imposition of sanctions and in again taking the lead as regards their removal. (2) Middle-Eastern Pact of Non-Aggression. 238. The Iranian Government remained anxious that the Middle-Eastern Pact of Non-Aggression should be completed by the inclusion of Afghanistan and signed. The Afghan Government agreed to participate mainly, it seems, because there was no good reason why they should not. The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs also wished to see the pact signed. The Iraqi Government, by taking the view that it should, in logic, be signed only after an agreed settlement of their frontier with Iran, were able to extract some diplomatic support from Turkey over the frontier quarrel. 239. Eventually, the Iranian, Iraqi and Turkish Governments seemed at one in wishing that the pact should be signed at latest by April 1937, but this was left dependent on the prior achievement of the frontier settlement.r III.— Internal Affairs (Political). (A) General. 241. The three principal events of the year in their chronological order were the unveiling of women, the introduction of exchange control restrictions and the return of the Valiahd from Switzerland. A fourth, the arrest and trial on charges of bribery of a considerable number of officials of the Ministry of Communications, only yields in importance to the above three from the fact that such arrests are so regular a feature of the Shah’s system of government that they hardly need to be singled out any longer for special mention. 242. The 8th January was, in the words of the Journal de Teheran, an historic day. The Shah opened a new school and was accompanied by the Queen and the two Princesses, all of whom were unveiled. This event gave the signal for the beginning of an energetic campaign to compel the unveiling of women. Officials, notables, merchants, &amp;c., were forced to give receptions to which the guests were obliged to bring their wives; droshky and bus drivers were instructed not to carry women who were veiled, hammams refused to admit them, and the Tehran shopkeepers “spontaneously” decided to refuse to serve them. In certain towns pickets of police turned them off the main streets. The tempo of the movement varied greatly, according to the disposition of the local officials; on the whole, the most vigorous methods were used in the most fanatical districts, such as Tabriz, where the campaign was pushed through by the aid of much roughness and even cruelty on the part of the police. There was much opposition to the movement on religious grounds, on grounds of expense and because women who had always been veiled hated being forced to attend functions in European clothes, in which they knew that they would appear ridiculous. It was a common sight at many of the receptions to find the men and the women on opposite sides of the room and the latter hiding their faces with their hands or the lapels of their coats. It is difficult to estimate the volume of religious opposition to the move ment ; but it was hardly ever openly voiced and the Government was able to coerce the powerless mullahs as easily as the rest of the population. The hardship arising out of the expense of new clothes was mitigated in the case of all Govern ment servants by an advance of a month’s pay, but even so mid-winter was a harsh moment to select for so sweeping a reform. But though there was much opposition to the movement, there was no serious resistance, and by the spring it was apparent that the Shah had again been successful in forcing upon his subjects a radical change in their traditional mode of life. Later in the year evidence was forthcoming that the change was popular in some female quarters, but some 400 members of a tribe settled on the Iranian coast of the Persian Gulf migrated to Kalba. Their motives were believed to be aversion to unveiling their women added to the desire to avoid conscription. 243. In his introduction to the annual report for 1925, Sir Hughe Knatehbull-Hugessen wrote : “ Over-taxation has reduced the great mass of the population to utter poverty, individual business enterprise is being killed by the Trade Monopoly Law, while the need for money and yet more money for the railway and industrial programme threatens to drive the country into a desperate position so long as the Shah remains resolutely opposed to foreign loans. This promises to be the outstanding problem of the coming year.” This prophecy was amply confirmed by events and, though this is not the place in which to write the history of the financial and economic history of the year, the strain imposed on the resources of the country by the Shah’s lavish programme of economic developments constituted so unquestionably the main feature of the year that some mention must be made of it. It had for some time been apparent that, though the economic position of the country was fundamentally sound, the Government were seriously over-spending. At the beginning of 1936 expenditure on the railway had reached its peak, new schemes involving the expenditure of millions of pounds were being hatched almost daily, and impartial observers were already beginning to speculate when the crash would come. The rate of exchange which, though liable to sharp fluctuations, had leveraged for some years approximately 80 rials to the £, dropped steadily fromabout 86 in mid-December 1935 to 100 at the end of February and at the beginning of March the Government had no choice but to introduce stringent regulations for the control of foreign exchange. The rate of exchange was arbitrarily fixed at 80 by the Shah after the Minister of Finance had selected 85, the Imperial Bank of Iran gave the Government a credit of £300,000 at a low rate of interest to provide a fund for the support of the exchange, and it was understood that a policy of economy was to be pursued by the drastic suppression of a number of schemes of economic development. As the year wore on, however, it became apparent that most of the good resolutions in regard to economy were being forgotten and that despite the system of control the foreign exchange situation was becoming steadily more critical. The Government began in the autumn to diaw on its credit from the Imperial Bank of Iran, while by the end of the year semi-Government trading companies were understood to be in receipt of credits from that bank amounting to approximately £500,000. At the same time it became known that the balance of payments arising out of the Irano-German Clearing Agreement had become badly upset, an estimate from a good source being that at the cncl of the year the sum owing to Germany was as much as 20 million marks. 1 he Government were, moreover, seizing on every possible expedient to obtain foreign exchange, and the year closed with foreign contractors badly frightened by the sudden regulation of the Government that banks might only give them overdrafts if these were covered by deposits in Iran of gold, foreign currency or negotiable securities. 244. It is happier to turn from these difficulties to the arrival home of the \ aliahd from his school in Switzerland. He had been away for five years and was 16 years old when he arrived back at the beginning of May. He proved to be a well-grown, good-looking boy, and when the Diplomatic Corps were presented to him at a special reception soon after his return, he discharged his part with grace and courtesy. During the rest of the year little was seen of him; he lived quietly at the Palace and took part in but few public functions, though he accom panied his father on his tour to Tabriz, Kermanshah and Hamadan in the autumn and went with him in November to Mazanderan and Gilan. At the end of the year he was pursuing his studies at the Military Academy under the French Military Mission, finding his relaxation in riding and football. 245. Mention must now be made of the scandal in the Ministry of Com munications. On the 19th January the Prime Minister announced to the Majlis that M. Ali Mansour had proved himself negligent in the performance of his duties and was therefore relieved of his appointment as Minister of Hoads and Communications. At about the same time it became known that a number of officials in the Ministry as well as certain Iranians in the employ of foreign contracting firms, such as Kampsax and the Netherlands Harbour Works Company, had been arrested on charges of peculation and bribery. Later M. Mansour was himself arrested, as was his predecessor, M. Reza Afshar, who was alleged to have accepted a bribe of £400 from Issa Kooros, the agent of Imperial Chemical Industries (Limited) and other British firms, in connexion with a contract for the purchase of explosives. A special sub-commission of the Ministry of Justice which was appointed to make an enquiry into the whole question, produced in March a report which contained a formidable series of accusations against some fifteen persons besides the two ex-Ministers, and with the summer came a series of spectacular trials. The first was that of M. Afshar, who was found guilty of accepting a bribe from Kooros and was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment, to a fine equal to double the amount of the bribe and to the deprivation of the right to serve as a Government servant. M. Mansour’s turn came next. He was accused of accepting two bribes, totalling 250,000 rials (£3,125), and of having caused a loss to the Government by placing an order for a dredger with one foreign company when another had submitted an appreciably lower tender. He put up a spirited defence, pointing out that he had had control of the expenditure of enormous sums and could have taken, had he wished, far larger sums than those mentioned in his indictment, and that in general he had had the tremendous task of building up an efficient department out of unpromising material and had done the best he could. To the general surprise he was acquitted, the court ruling that there was insufficient evidence on all three accounts. In so far as any expression of opinion is possible in Iran, his acquittal appeared to be popular, more than one person saying that he probably had■Ml 50 contrived to feather his own nest, but that he had in general done a very good job of work at the Ministry of Communications. The turn of the smaller fry came last. Twenty-three were finally put on trial, of whom eighteen w^ere j:ound guilty and sentenced to terms of imprisonment ranging from two months to three years. 246. Almost the chief interest of these trials was the highly organised publicity which accompanied them. The press filled many columns with detailed reports of the proceedings, making numerous references to the acuteness of the judge’s comments and to the able arguments of counsel on either side. Photo graphs were published of the public prosecutor addressing the court, the judges in their magnificent new robes, even of the public streaming out at the close of the day’s proceedings. All this elaborate staging was apparently designed to show the world how far the administration of justice had advanced in Iran. Nevertheless, it was announced shortly after the conclusion of the first trial that the Minister of Justice had resigned, and that Nayyer-ul-Mulk, the President of the High Court of Appeal which tried Mansour, had been dismissed. It was strongly rumoured that the judges had accepted bribes from some of the accused. 247. From these trials it is interesting to pass to the fate of the two classes of persons who during the year were unostentatiously removed from positions of authority, the Bahais and the Jews. Early in the year it was learned that all officers who were Bahais were being dismissed from the army on the direct orders of the Shah. No official explanation was ever given, but it was rumoured that His Majesty desired to make some pro-Islamic gesture in order to counteract the suggestion that the campaign for the unveiling of women had been dictated by motives of anti-Islamism. The purge of Jews was in a sense less drastic since Judaism remained one of the permissible religions for an army officer, but Jews were systematically removed during the year from the Customs Administration and other Government offices. Possibly the motive here also was a desire to show that the policy of the Government was not anti-Islamic. 248. But if these dismissals were a sop to Islam, the real urge behind the Shah's policy remained the desire to show that Islam need not lag behind the west in material progress. Western dress, western factories, even justice clothed in the trappings of the west, all these were the visible signs of the same policy. An outstanding and praiseworthy manifestation of it was in the field of education. At the top the university of Tehran continued to take shape, at the bottom night- schools were opened for adults where classes were held in reading and writing. The schools proved extremely popular and with better educational facilities for children there is no doubt that the problem of illiteracy was being seriously tackled. Unfortunately, however, it is but seldom that the adjective “ popular ” can be used to describe the Shah’s reforms. It is true that he has so broken all opposition that he can virtually push through anything, it is true also that if some of his schemes seem unnecessary or extravagant, the majority of them are undoubtedly for the ultimate good of the country. But it is no less true that in spite of, or even perhaps because of, the introduction of many progressive measures and in spite of the pride which many Persians take in the outward manifestations of progress, the power of the Shah’s regime is still based on fear. It is generally recognised that, while he retains the full vigour of his powers, no serious threat to the regime is to be expected; but if one question that was insistently asked in 1936 was “ How long can this lavish expenditure continue?” the return of the Valiahd focussed attention almost as insistently on another one : “ What chance has the boy when the father dies?” (B) The Shah. 249. The Shah made three journeys away from Tehran during the course of the year. In April he visited his properties in Mazanderan and went on from there to Pahlevi where he met the Valiahd on his return from Switzerland at the beginning of May. Accompanied by the Valiahd he left Tehran again at the end of September on a tour of rather over three weeks’ duration, during the course of which he visited Tabriz, Senneh, Kermanshah and Hamadan. Though in an affable mood at Tabriz he was his old alarming self at Senneh, Kermanshah and Hamadan and there is no doubt that his periodical inspections fill the local officials wherever he goes with what may be regarded as wholesome alarm. After a brief stay in Tehran the Shah and the Valiahd departed again for the51 Turcoman races after which they travelled west along the coast as far as Pahlevi, returning to the capital via the Chalus Road. 250. The Shah’s health was good throughout the year and the return of the Valiahd seemed to make him much more cheerful than he had been for some time. In September he betrothed both his daughters, the elder to the son of the Prime Minister, M. Jam, and the younger to the elder son of Qawam-ul-Mulk, head of an influential Shirazi family, though now resident in Tehran. 251. In the autumn the Shah’s 478 ton yacht, ordered the previous year from a Dutch firm, arrived in the Caspian. Its lavish equipment includes a cocktail bar, and it is thought that the Shah’s chief object in acquiring it was to be able to show it off to Kemal Ataturk when the latter returns His Majesty’s visit. Judged by ordinary standards, the purchase of this yacht would seem to be a piece of useless extravagance. (C) Officials. (i) Cabinet. 252. General Amanullah Jahanbani was appointed Director-General of the Department of Industry early in March, his predecessor, Dr. Muhammad Hussein Amin, being made assistant to that Department. 253. Majid Ahy, formerly Governor-General of Pars, was appointed Minister of Roads and Communications, in place of Ali Mansour, on the 11th January, 1936. 254. General Ismail Amir Fazli was appointed Acting Minister of War in the room of General Muhammad Nakhchevan on the 31st March. 255. Mussin Sadr resigned from his post as Minister of Justice on the 9th September, and was succeeded by Dr. Matin Daftary. (2) Governors-General and Governors. 256.

The following list gives the principal enactments passed by the Majlis during the year :— Law specifying penalties for offenders against the sanctions declared against Italy. Law concerning garages and transport agencies, together with various regulations. Regulations concerning the disposal of the estates of foreign nationals in Iran. Law governing promotions in the army. Supplementary law relating to the Teachers’ College (Ecole Normale) and the Tehran University. Decree concerning instruction of adults. Law concerning a new customs tariff. Law concerning the punishment of armed smugglers. Law sanctioning the clearing agreement between Germany and Iran. Regulations concerning hotels, restaurants and places of public resort. Laws sanctioning the engagement in public service of the following foreign nationals :— One French national, one Austrian named Kuba, three German professors for the university, three technical experts from Germany, four German mining engineers, one German technician for the Majlis printing press; Dr. Koch, a German, as professor at the university; one Swede^ together with his wife; Mr. William Mackenzie as auditor; and one Maxim Sirro of unspecified nationality. (E) Sheikh of Mohammerah. 259. I he sheikh died at his house in Tehran during the night of the 24th May, 1936. The cause of death was given as heart failure as the'result of a stroke, but no one was present when he died. A brawl had taken place in the house that night, owing to his son Abdullah’s forcing himself into the sheikh’s house; possibly this caused the old man’s stroke. Some reports indicate that Abdullah was even more directly responsible for his father’s decease. 260 The local courts have issued the usual certificate of heirship after the proper formalities; the widow with whom the sheikh had lived in Tehran, Batool Mafi Makhr-us-Saltaneh, was given the rights which normally accrue to a deceased person’s widow (no provision being made for any other relicts), and the rest of the estate was to be divided up among twenty-seven sons and daughters. Appropriate steps were also taken by the heirs concerning the sheikh’s estate in Iraq. (F) Miscellaneous. (1) Publicity. 261.. 1 he pi ess buieau at I aris, and the Bars agency at Tehran, continue !?J Un ? ™ 0 r n ^ befo W The latter agency has begun to make use of the British Official Wireless, which is sent to it every day.■ ■H '■wm 53 (2) Press. 263. I he Journal de Teheran, published entirely in French, has continued to disseminate Government propaganda; it is well printed, publishes selected photographs which are usually quite recognisable, and serves up to foreigners exactly the pabulum which the Government wishes them to digest. Important events of a controversial nature are often ignored. The vernacular papers have also continued to publish exactly what the police allow or direct. 264. The Royal sensitiveness to criticism in the foreign press seems to have reached an acute stage during the year. The Minister in Paris was certainly recalled owing to the vapourings of a writer in one of the Paris revues. According to rumours, the real reason for the withdrawal of the Ministers from London, Berne and Brussels was similar. (3) The Strike in the National Teachers’ College. 265. Towards the end of the year a rather remarkable strike took place in the National Teachers’ College at Tehran. A number of students are trained by that institution for about five years, at very low rates, in return for which they sign an undertaking to teach in the college, at a low salary, in order to pay back the balance which they owe. About 300 of them, however, combined together and refused to adhere to this arrangement, but proposed to pay back the balance in cash and take a full discharge, in order that they might earn high salaries in some of the recently-formed monopoly companies. Policemen and armed soldiers were summoned, and certain ringleaders were put in prison. Eventually, after the mediation of one of the staff named Dr. Reza-zadeh Shafagh, the matter was settled. He appears to have found that the students were justified in their action, and in principle the students are now free to pay the balance in cash and seek employment where they will. The crux of the matter is no doubt the fact that the salaries paid to teachers are exceedingly small, while the cost of living has gone up. 266. The Government, however, is said to be making plans for the stabili sation of salaries paid by the monopoly companies on some uniform basis; if so, perhaps the strikers will find that they are not so much better off after all. IV.— Military Affairs. (A) —The Army. (1) G eneral. 267. The Iranian army is surrounded by as impenetrable a fog of secrecy as ever. The contributory causes are probably three and in almost equal proportions, viz., a fear of espionage, a fear of losing by comparison and a failure to distinguish between espionage and that liaison which is commonly maintained between the General Staffs of more advanced countries. When the lack of a free press is taken into account it will be realised that almost every vent for legitimate intelligence is closed. During the past year the strength of the army has increased by nearly 10,000 men. A considerable quantity of war material has been purchased, and the amount expended on the services has risen by £1| million sterling and now represents 37 5 per cent, of the total budgeted expenditure of the country. Those troops engaged on frontier security have suffered no defeats. There have been no cases of serious disaffection. Training has been carried on without interruption. The efficiency of the Iranian army, therefore, if not accurately computable, does not at least appear to be any less than in the preceding year. (2) Expenditure. 268. In the estimates for the Iranian year 1315 (the 21st March, 1936, to the 20th March, 1937), the credit provided for the Ministry of War is 243,729,980 rials, or about £3,046,624 at present rates. This sum includes provision for the navy and the air force, for which no separate heads are shown. It shows an increase of 20 million rials (£250,000) over last year’s figures; 400,000 rials(£5,000) are provided for conscription expenses, 6 million (£75,000) for the frontier guards and 25,678,400 rials (£320.980) for the gendarmerie. Tlum, the total military expenditure amounts to 375,808,380 rials (£4,697,604) or 37 o per cent, of the total budgeted expenditure of the country. In addition to the above, in the supplementary estimates a credit of £2 million was approved for the Ministry of War. This, presumably, is to be provided out of the Iranian Govern ment's holdings abroad and is intended for the purchase of military stores. (3) Strength. 269. The strength of the Iranian army, as estimated on the 1st June, 1936, was 96,462 of all ranks. This figure represents an increase of 9,413 over the estimated strength for 1935. Constituting the Central Garrison. (4) Organisation. 270. A degree of stability, not hitherto noticeable, appears to have been reached in the organisation of the Iranian forces. Briefly stated, that organisation is as follows :— The 1st Cavalry Division The 1st Infantry Division The 2nd Infantry Division The 3rd (Western Azerbaijan) Division. The 4th (Eastern Azerbaijan) Division. The 5th (Senneh) Division. The 6th (Khuzistan) Division. The 7th (Ears) Division. The 8th (Mekran) Division. The 9th (Khorasan) Division. The Gilan Independent Composite Brigade. The Kermanshah Independent Composite Brigade. The Isfahan Independent Composite Brigade. The Kerman Independent Composite Brigade. The Turcoman Sahra Independent Composite Regiment. The Gurgan Independent Composite Regiment. The Bandar Abbas Independent Composite Regiment. (5) Armament. 271. No accurate information is available, but large shipments of arms and ammunition have been landed at Bandar Shahpur throughout the year. These included thirty light tanks built by the Czechoslovakian firm of Moravska. Replacements of obsolete arms and supplies of ammunition have been reaching the provincial formations from the arsenals of Tehran. (6) Remounts. 272. A draft of 500 light artillery horses arrived from Hungary in the summer. They are reported to have cost about £25 apiece in the country of origin. Those seen are not of a good stamp, and do not thrive on the Iranian barley. Over 100 cases of piroplasmosis have occurred. Most of these horses are geldings, but a few entires were purchased. It is most unlikely that breeding from two such extreme types as these and the light, Iranian, plateau-bred pony will result in the production of a suitable animal. (7) Changes in the higher Appointments. 273. The only important change which occurred during the year was the dismissal of Sar Lashgar Muhammad Nakhchevan, Amir Muwassiq, and his replacement as Minister of War by Sar Lashgar Ismail Amir Fazli. The new Minister appears to resemble his predecessor in stolidity, brainlessness, lack of initiative and settled conviction that whatever problem arises it will be better to ask his master.(8) Conscription. 274. Conscription has been working smoothly, and the quotas forthcoming from the various districts. After a successful effort in 1935 to extend conscription into the remote parts of Kurdistan, further extensions to embrace the settled Turcomans and a small section of the Qashgai tribe in and around Tul-i-Khusravi have been made. (9) Manoeuvres. 275. In all probability manoeuvres were arranged during 1936 for all provincial formations as well as for the central garrison. Those actually reported, mainly from consular sources, were as follows :— The 6th (Khuzistan) Division in May. The 9th (Khorasan) Division in July. The Central Garrison in September. The Kermanshah Independent Composite Brigade in December. 276. As usual, no descriptions of these manoeuvres appeared in the press nor were any invitations to attend them extended to foreign military attaches (excepting the Turkish) or to the civilian public. 277. Two Russian-speaking officers (one from the 3rd and one from the 4th Division) attended, by invitation, some manoeuvres of the Caucasian forces of the U.S.S R. (10) Reviews and Parades. 278. The usual review was held on the 22nd February, the anniversary of the coup d'fitat. Sixty-eight aeroplanes, 25,000 troops (in which figure large civilian elements consisting of boy scouts, girl guides and students are included) 5,000 animals and 80 motor vehicles were on parade. The turn out, drill and marching were a definite improvement on last year. The usual displays were eliminated and the parade consisted only of a review and march past. (11) Military Operations. 279. Though there have been no operations worthy of the name, troops have remained under field service conditions throughout the year in Baluchistan and Kurdistan. In Baluchistan little actual fighting has taken place, and the Iranian Government appears to be playing off one tribal leader against another. Little has been achieved as the leaders are suspicious of the Government s sincerity when promised a pardon. 280. A food blockade directed against the Ismailzais is reported to have been partially successful and to have caused much distress among, and desertions from, the tribe against whom it was directed. In Kurdistan the Government s policy, if reported correctly, is on the whole conciliatory. They have undertaken minor’ offensives against recalcitrant tribes and subsidised others with rifles, raised a form of tribal levy and attempted to win over to permanent Iranian nationality and residence the migratory tribes who move from Iran to Iraq and vice versa. Any further considerable progress seems improbable until such time as the conclusion of a treaty with Iraq, the demarcation of the frontier and the inauguration of better relations will pave the way for the formulation of a definite tribal policy advantageous to both States. A slight fracas occurred between Iranian and Afghan soldiery on the frontier, the cause being a dispute over the Helmand water rights. A general disarming and clearing up of Tangistan and Dashtistan was reported to have been begun in the summer. (12) Military Works. 281. The construction of a new fort at Khwash was reported. Work on strategic roads has been active in South-East Iran, where construction of a load from Zahidan to the port of Charbar via Khwash and Iranshahr is in progress. (13) Foreign Military Missions. 282. The French military mission, which now numbers eleven, appears to be contented and working to the satisfaction of the Ministry of War. The less harmonious atmosphere in which the Belgian air mission works is noticed in the airmmm 56 force section of this report. It would not be out of place, perhaps, to say that the success of the one and the partial failure of the other are not due so much to the personality of the leaders or the capabilities of the members as to the nature of their duties. Two prominent features of the Iranian character (grudgingly admitted by even their most ardent supporters) are conceit and inability to co-operate. 283. The first results in the Iranian who is learning a trade telling his instructor, after the most brief period of instruction, that he knows sufficient to dispense with further tutelage. Obviously this unwillingness to learn will be more strongly evinced when the subject of instruction is a concrete one like flying than when it is more abstract like military history. 284. Similarly, the second characteristic will render the relations of instructor and pupil more difficult in proportion to the degree of contact between the parties and a professor lecturing on military subjects at a college will not be hampered by it so much as a flying instructor whose very duties must force him, frequently, to give orders and assume administrative responsibility. In other words, the closer and the more numerous the points of contact, the greater the possibility of friction. (14) Colleagues. (i) Japanese. 285. Commandant S. Obara, who arrived in January to relieve Commandant Ueta, was recalled in July as the result of an unseemly fracas between him and his Minister. The post remained vacant till October when Commandant H. Fukuti arrived. (ii) French. 286. Commandant Robert Leleu arrived in April, the post having remained vacant since the death of Commandant David in September of 1935. (iii) Italian. 287. Capitaine de Frigate Luciano Bigi arrived in October to take up the newly created appointment of Italian naval attach^. (iv) Russian. 288. Colonel Absalmoff expects to be transferred shortly. He will have been four years in Tehran by April 1937, though no tenure of the appointment is, he says, laid down. (v) Turkish. 289. No change in the appointment of Turkish military attache has taken place during 1936. 290. All these colleagues are friendly and helpful. (15) British Officers — Travellers. 291. The following officers visited Iran, most of them in transit from India to Europe, during 1936 :— Major H. J. Underwood, l/15th Punjab Regiment. Captain W. B. Radford, 1st King’s Dragoon Guards. Captain C. A. Street, South Staffordshire Regiment. Captain H. R. K. L. Lawes, South Staffordshire Regiment. Lieutenant J. E. J. Davie, Grenadier Guards. Lieutenant R. E. J. C. Coates, Grenadier Guards. Lieutenant H. N. Blair, Iraq Levies. Lieutenant J. O. M. Ashton, Iraq Levies. Lieutenant Ajit Singh Guraya, 5/8th Punjab Regiment. Lieutenant P. J. Lewis, The Buff’s.58 (3) Casualties. 295. Many minor accidents occurred during the year. The more serious were the following :— (i) While practising formation flying for the military review held on the 23rd February, one of thirty machines crashed on the Jalalieh parade ground, the pilot and observer being killed. The machine, which was one of the “ Audax ” type, was completely wrecked. (ii) During October a machine of the £C Audax ” type caught fire at a height of about 400 metres. The pilot managed to land, but the machine was totally destroyed. (iii) At the Qila Murgha military aerodrome during November two machines of the ct Audax ” type collided head-on when landing. Both the pilots escaped serious injury. The machines were badly damaged. (4) New Orders. 296. It is understood that an order has been placed with the De Havilland Aircraft Company for five additional machines of the ‘ ‘ Rapide ’ type, fitted with £C Gipsy VI ” engines for the Iranian air mail service. This will bring the total number of aeroplanes of this type to eight. (5) Factories. 297. The aircraft factory at Doshanteppeh has been completed and all the necessary machinery installed. The personnel employed is as follows :— British adviser : Captain R. Walker. British mechanics (Hawker) : 9. British mechanics (De Havilland) : 1. British mechanics (Bristol) : 2. Iranian air force officers : 10. Iranian air force mechanics : 40. Civilians : 80. 298. A further four British mechanics (Hawker) will be leaving the United Kingdom in the near future for service at the factory. 299. At present the factory is engaged on the assembly of fuselages for Hawker and De Havilland aircraft, the reconditioning of Hawker and De Havilland machines and repairs and overhauls. Progress, although slow, is said to be satisfactory. (6) Landing Grounds and A erodromes. 300. —(i) Repairs to the landing ground at Shiraz and to the road connecting it with that town were carried out during the year. (ii) Repairs to the Kermanshah aerodrome have been carried out. This is believed to be in preparaaion for the commencement of the Iranian civil air line. (7) Educational Establishments. 301. The establishment of the school for Iranian air force cadets at Ahwaz is reported to be 5 officers, 20 n.c.o. instructors and 25 pupils. (8) Petrol Storage Tanks. 302. Two petrol storage tanks, each of a capacity of 30,000 litres, have been sunk at the Mehrabad military aerodrome. Although these tanks were completed in September, it is understood that they are still empty. (9) Photographic Equipment. 303. Two lorries, complete with photographic equipment, of British manu facture, have been supplied to the Iranian Air Force. (10) Foreign Air Missions. 304. The contract of Colonel Bever, head of the Belgian air mission, was renewed for a further period of two years in May. The contracts of the remaining59 members of the mission have not yet been renewed, though long overdue for renewal. They are at present on leave, and it is rumoured that they will not return. Colonel Bever is, therefore, the only member of the mission now in Tehran. One reason given is their dislike of Colonel Bever, which is so pronounced that Major Guillaume (the second senior member of the mission) stated that, if Colonel Bever’s contract was renewed, he and the remaining members would refuse to stay on in Iran. Another report (not confirmed, but from a reliable source) states that Sartip Ahmad Nakhchevan (until recently Commandant of the Iranian air force) and other officers had taken advantage of Colonel Bever’s short absence on leave to conduct some active propaganda against the mission and had attempted to convince His Imperial Majesty the Shah that the Iranians were now perfectly capable of £ £ running their own show ’ ’ and had no further need for foreign advisers. (11) Reconnaissance Flights. 305. During the month of November machines of the £C Tiger-Moth ” type, with pilots belonging to the Iranian air force, made reconnaissance flights over the projected civil air route from Tehran to Bushire and Tehran to Kermanshah. Trial flights do not appear to have been made over the final stages from Kermansnah to Bagdad. The, non-completion of an agreement between the Iranian and Iraqi Governments appear to be the reason. (12) Visits of Iranian Air Force Officers to Europe. 306. Sartip Ahmad Nakhchevan, Commandant of the Iranian air force, accompanied by Lieutenant Abulfath Afkhami, left for Europe on the 7th May and returned to Tehran on the 27th October. In an interview just after his arrival in Tehran, he said that he had enjoyed himself immensely and had been greatly impressed by all he had seen. He found the Hawker Engineering Company obliging and frank, and they had, he was sure, abandoned their previous and tiresome attitude of failing to understand the reason for the complaints about their aircraft. They were sending out another mechanic, he said, who would, he hoped, speedily effect what further repairs were necessary. He went on to say that he had received permission (presumably from His Imperial Majesty the Shah) to purchase thirty additional aircraft, and the type selected were Hawker “ Hinds ” with ££ Pegasus ” engine; he said that he had been assured by the Air Ministry that the present great activity in aeroplane factories in the United Kingdom would not unduly delay the execution of the Iranian Government’s orders. (C) The Iranian Navy. 307. The sloops Babr and Palang returned to Khorramshahr after dry docking in Bombay in April. 308. The dry dock referred to in paragraph 534 of the annual report for 1935 arrived in June and was moored at Bandar Shahpur. Its ultimate location is still in doubt. 309. Another tug of 1,500 h.p. and a crane barge capable of lifting 60 tons has been ordered from Italy. 310. The discipline of the ratings of the Iranian navy when ashore has been the subject of several complaints from Khorramshahr. Clashes with the police have occurred, and the naval officers are reported to side with their men, to flout justice and allow these lapses to embitter their relations with the civil authorities. (D) Gendarmerie. 311. There is nothing to report of this organisation except that it has taken over from the army the administration of the frontier guards—a preventive force raised to counter the activities of smugglers on the Iranian borders.9809 [16966] B THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJ ssty;Vgo^inme XT Printed for the use of the Foreign Office. 5S33 1 y ^ y- CONFIDENTIAL.

DURING 1937 the process of changing the old Persia into the new Iran steadily continued. The chief outward signs of this process are perhaps the new Tehran and the railway. The capital continues to grow : new avenues, paved with asphalt, replace the old lanes, factories and residential quarters increase, and the city already attracts immigrants from all parts of the country. As in so many cases, it must be open to doubt whether the large sums devoted to reconstruction have always been judiciously spent. There is still, for instance, no clean water supply in the town, but there are indications that the Shah is becoming more interested in questions of water supply and irrigation. It is sincerely to be hoped that a more active policy in these matters may be adopted. 2. Work on the railway has progressed favourably, more favourably perhaps from the Government’s point of view than from that of the contractors, who have met with great difficulties owing to the rise in all costs. The northern section, from Tehran to the Caspian, is now open, but has so far attracted little traffic. The southern and more important section, parts of which are already in use, should be completed in 1938, and the financial year 1937-38 should represent the peak of expenditure, probably some £6,500,000 for the year. A further railway from Tehran to Tabriz is talked of, and if this is undertaken (and the Shah is apparently determined upon it) the Iranian taxpayer must look forward for some years to come to a heavy burden of expense for railway building and equipment. The Iranian authorities hope that the railway, having no capital charges to meet, will be able to pay its way out of revenue. Most foreign experts seem to consider this impossible, at any rate for many years to come.3. The other main burthen of the taxpayer will continue to be the army. Tanks, artillery and other material are being acquired in increasing quantities, so much so that neighbouring States are beginning to wonder whether Iran may not be a potential aggressor in the future. The reasons which have led the Shah to spend so much on armaments are probably, however, quite simple: he had to have a sufficient force to keep order and, having acquired this, his natural wish, as a soldier, was to see his army provided with up-to-date material. Further, he has vivid recollections of the sufferings of a weak Persia in times of war and confusion, and is determined to avoid the recurrence of such a state of affairs. 4. If we consider the abstraction “ Iran ” in 1937 we must admit the claim that ‘ ‘ she ’ ’ has, in comparison with ‘ ‘ her ’ ’ situation ten years ago, made remarkable progress—the more remarkable in that it is, since the death of Teymourtache, the work of one man. About the progress of Iranians in general, it would be more difficult to dogmatise. Enterprising merchants, especially in Isfahan, seem to have been able to adapt themselves, with great profit, to present conditions. It is true also that some of the changes introduced by the present regime must be to the general advantage. Improved communications and the present high level of public security are obvious advantages to the general public. The efforts of the Government to provide increased facilities for education are widely appreciated. But, after all, the peasant cannot live on education and easy communications, and the economic situation of the villages has latterly shown no improvement, probably the reverse. In some parts of the country the peasant can, it is true, find work on railway construction, in factories and the like. But on the land his lot is a hard one. The vagaries of the climate and the exactions of the landlord have always been with him. The landlord gets little sympathy from the present regime, but the peasant still has to contend with the officials of the grain monopoly, the ubiquitous police, and the heavy taxation. In a naturally bad year, such as 1937 was in many districts, the poverty of the villages is extreme. It is no wonder that there is a general tendency to migrate to the large towns. The lot of the nomadic tribesmen is worse than that of the settled peasant, but, while there have been sporadic outbreaks among the tribesmen, the hand of the Administration is now too heavy for these disturbances to spread. 5. In the sphere of economics it is unhappily necessary to record a further deterioration in 1937. The shortage of exchange became steadily more embarrassing, while the Government’s requirements for railway, military and industrialisation purposes were not allowed to be reduced. The suicide of the Minister of Finance in February led to rumours of impending changes in the monopoly system and in the exchange control, but, with the exception of a little tinkering here and there, nothing was done. The incompetent working of the motor and wheat monopolies led, during the year, to transport difficulties and a shortage of wheat in some areas. The year closed with many rumours of impending change in the monopoly system, but it may again prove that the wish is father to the thought. 6. The past year thus provided no very spectacular developments, but rather a continuation of the processes described in previous reports. The country remains a baffling mixture of old and new. A law-suit, if no political interest is involved, may go through a series of appeals and counter-appeals on a system which recalls that of France. On the other hand, political suspects, however s liedit the ground of suspicion—an incautious remark or a visit to an unpopular friend—may find themselves in prison or banished to the provinces without any semblance of a trial. The position of foreigners is subject to incalculable changes: during most of 1937 the restrictions on social intercourse between Iranians and foreigners tended to become less severe; but towards the close of the vear these restrictions were, for some reason unknown, suddenly tightened up, and Persians are again extremely cautious about accepting invitations to foreign houses. 7. One minor, but perhaps significant, detail of 1937 seems worth recording : for the first time the Ramadan guns were not fired in Tehran nor, I believe, in many other places; nor were special hours introduced in the Ministries for the month of fasting. [16966] B 28. The position of the regime shows no notable change : it remains intensely unpopular, but there is no chance of opposition so long as the Shah remains, as he apparently does, in full possession of his health and strength. His present position recalls Lord Curzon’s description of Nasr-ed-Din Shah:— “ Rising early in the morning, he devotes the forenoon to audience with his Ministers and to matters of State. The smallest detail is submitted to him, and is not decided except upon his authority. His Ministers disavow all initiative, and tremble at any executive authority. Imperious, diligent and fairly just, the Shah is in his own person the sole arbiter of Persia’s fortunes. All policy emanates from him. He supervises every department with a curiosity that requires to be constantly appeased: and his attention both to foreign and domestic politics is constant and unremitting. There is a consensus of opinion in Persia that he is the most competent man in the country, and the best ruler that it can produce. Nor will anyone deny him the possession of patriotism and of a genuine interest in the welfare of the nation.” (Curzon’s Persia, Ed. 1892, vol. I, p. 400.) 9. All this may justly be said of the present Shah and, unfortunately, his Ministers still, in the main, “ disavow all initiative and tremble at any executive authority.” The centralisation of all power, and the official dread of responsi bility, have reached such a pass that the most trivial frontier questions—even in a recent case the theft and recovery of a couple of donkeys—cannot be dealt with locally but must be discussed between the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and His Majesty’s Legation. This excessive centralisation has many drawbacks, and among others that of making the Shah personally responsible, in the eyes of his subjects, for every change which affects their lives. It is not surprising then that, with the constantly increased cost of living, the persistence of “graft” (which tends to increase with the cost of living), and the difficulty for the ordinary Persian to lead a quiet life, the regime is, in spite of the benefits it has conferred in many directions, in general heartily disliked. 10. The passage of another year has made it no more easy to forecast with confidence the future of the dynasty. The Valiahd has begun to play a rather larger, though still small, part in public affairs, and by official visits to educational centres, patronage of boy scouts and similar activities, must be becoming rather more widely known. Though agreeable and intelligent, he does not yet give the impression of being well qualified to take his father’s place. Few people seem to expect that the present system of government will long outlive its author: the Constitution is still in being, the country is still in theory a constitutional monarchy, and one possibility of the future may be an essay in constitutional government. But I do not propose to burthen this report with any addition to the long list of prophesies about the future of this country which have been made in so many quarters in the last ten years. One thing, however, does seem certain : the country cannot return to the conditions obtaining before the time of Reza Shah : some aspects of modernisation, such as the unveiling of women, the cinema, the development of outdoor games, the improved communications, the introduc tion of schools on more or less modern lines, must affect the character of the nation. 11. The foreign policy of Iran has continued on familiar lines. It is opportunist, but has certain identifiable features, among which is a determina tion to insist upon equality of treatment. This attitude is easily understood and is even praiseworthy; it does, however, in some cases, lead to a certain unreality. One is expected, for instance, to discuss the difficulties of British subjects in the wilder parts of the country in terms which would be more appropriate to Hampstead. But when one has become used to this polite fiction it is possible in many cases to enlist the sympathy of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in keeping abuses within bounds. 12. Another feature of Iranian policy is the improvement of relations with the neighbouring States, though in the case of Iraq this policy has been less clearly envisaged than in those of Turkey and Afghanistan. The main events of 1937 were in pursuance of this policy; they included the signature of a series of treaties with Turkey, the conclusion of an Iran-Iraq frontier settlement (not yet ratified) and the signature of the Pact of Saad-Abad between Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and Turkey. These agreements are dealt with more fully later in this report: it suffices to say here that the Turkish treaties consolidated the[16966] b 3 5 already good relations between the two countries, and that the Pact of Saad-Abad, while unlikely to have the importance which its authors claim for it, will at least provide a convenient forum for the settlement of disputes. The agreement with Iraq settled the long-disputed questions of the frontier and of the anchorage demanded by the Iranians at Abadan. It did not settle the important questions which arise in connexion with the control and navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab and no progress with these had been made at the close of the year. The present system of management is to last for a year after the ratification of the treaty, but the Iraqi Government, contrary to the advice of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, accepted a provision which in effect enables the Iranian Government, if they wish, to veto the further continuance of the present system after the lapse of a year. 13. Anglo-Iranian relations followed the lines which have become familiar in the last few years. The Iranian Government showed signs in February and March of wishing to put forward proposals for a new treaty, but in the event made no move. Proposals were made by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom for a commercial agreement, but these were declined by the Iranian Government. Thus no advance was made towards a redefinition of either the political or commercial relations of the two countries. In the early months of the year we had to complain of the high-handed action of Iranian sloops in the Persian Gulf, where Arab dhows had been seized on the high seas and even in Arab territorial waters. Strong representations were made in Tehran and no case of interference with Arab dhows on the high seas has subsequently been reported. It remains to be seen whether the Iranian navy can permanently resist the temptation to assert its importance by this easy method. Gulf questions have, with the exception of these dhow cases, caused no serious difficulties, though the Iranian claim to Bahrein has been maintained at every convenient opportunity, and on one occasion by the confiscation of the papers of a Bahrein dhow at Khorramshahr. The question of lights and buoys in Iranian waters took a fresh turn in the summer, when the Iranian Government suddenly announced their intention of scrapping the draft agreement for the transfer to them of the existing installations, and of providing their own service. This project, if carried into effect, will bring to an end yet another of the questions which were to have been dealt with in the old general treaty. 14. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the Imperial Bank of Iran have continued their operations with no more difficulties than are the lot of any foreign concern working in this country. Iran for the Iranians is the cry, and while the foreigner is an unfortunate necessity for the present, it is the pleasure and the duty of all Iranians to keep him in his place. This attitude, given the past history of Iran, is probably inevitable; the principal British interests here have succeeded in adapting themselves to the changed conditions, and by showing their readiness to help and support the Government have, I think, acquired the confidence of the regime. 15. The lot of British subjects in East Iran continues to be unenviable, and cases of oppression by the police, the customs and other authorities are still reported. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs have on several occasions been helpful, to such extent as their influence permits. No admission is ever made that the local authorities were at fault or exceeded their powers, but the representations made do sometimes produce an effect, and the position of the local British subjects has recently seemed to improve rather than the reverse. 16. Our relations with Iran may be described as, on the whole, satisfactory. No important negotiations have, it is true, taken place, but if we may judge from the friendly attitude of the Persians who are allowed to frequent foreign houses,” no suspicions of the policy of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom are entertained. There is, however, one fly in the ointment, and that is the sensitiveness of the Shah personally to the foreign press. 17. This sensitiveness can only be described as morbid. The European press-clipping agencies employed to forward cuttings appear to be most efficient, and references to Iran in the most obscure papers are duly submitted. Woe betide the Iranian Minister abroad who fails to detect some reference to Iran which has been spotted by one of the agencies. When once offence has been given, it is long6 before it is forgotten. For two years the Iranian Legation in Washington has been closed and for nearly a year there has been no Minister in Paris. The British press has given offence on several occasions, and it is not too much to say that all cordiality in the official relations between Iran and any given country may be at any moment imperilled by the lucubrations of some disgruntled traveller. This situation is not likely to change during the Shah’s lifetime ; fortunately, the indig nation aroused in such cases is not allowed to affect business matters, at least if one may judge by the American example. The American concession was granted at almost the worst moment in the official relations of the two countries. 18. A word should be said of Iran’s present economic relations with Germany and the Soviet Union. With both countries she has clearing or barter agreements, and these agreements seem to have been managed on the Iranian side with a light-hearted optimism which is approaching the point of danger. In the case of Germany especially, it seems to have been overlooked that goods imported, even if they are not paid for through the ordinary commercial channels, have got to be paid for somehow. The German authorities have apparently encouraged Iranian buying on an excessive scale, and the adverse balance under this agreement was causing a good deal of anxiety at the close of the year. In the case of the Soviet Union, too, the working of the Commercial Agreement has not given much satisfaction to Iran, and it will probably be a long time before the Iranian authorities can produce the personnel to manage this kind of business in a satis factory way. II.— Foreign Relations. (A )—British Empire — General. 19. The Coronation of their Majesties was duly celebrated in Tehran and by His Majesty’s consular officers throughout Iran. Apart from the opportunity which they offered to British subjects to give expression to their feelings of loyalty and affection towards their Majesties, the principal feature of the Coronation celebrations was the evidence they afforded of the thoroughness and severity of the boycott of the British consulates by the Iranian Government. 20. Consular officers were instructed beforehand by His Majesty’s Legation to invite to their official receptions all persons—civil, military, or private—^whom they would naturally invite on such an occasion, because it was felt that, although in the circumstances few Iranians could be expected to accept, a wide distribution of invitations would at least demonstrate that on the British side there was no lack of friendliness. The Iranian response was, as had been anticipated, unsatis factory. In several towns the local authorities refused on their own authority to allow any relaxation of the restrictions. Others asked Tehran for instruction, and were in every case ordered to apply the general rule, namely, that only the Governor, his deputy, the chief of the municipality and the chief of police might accept invitations from foreign consulates. Consequently, practically no Iranians other than the authorised officials attended the receptions at any of His Majesty’s consulates, the most notable exceptions being General Mu’iny at Ahwaz, Colonel Bayendor at Khorramshahr and the senior military officers at Tabriz! There was, however, ample evidence that the boycott in no way reflected local opinion and that the notables of all the towns concerned would have willingly participated in the celebrations if the official ban had not prevented them. Some indication that the Coronation aroused considerable public interest is given by the fact that films of the ceremonial shown in Tehran and Ahwaz attracted good audiences. 21. Apart from the boycott of the consulates, which was and is applied impartially to all foreign consulates, the attitude of the Iranian Government towards the Coronation was sufficiently correct. His Excellency Hassan Esfandiary, a respected public figure of the older generation and President of the Majlis, attended the Coronation ceremonies as the representative of the Shah. A superb carpet was offered as a gift to His Majesty The King, and the refusal of the invitation to send a ship to the naval review arose from the limitation of the navy rather than from any lack of courtesy. The favourable impression of England which M. Hassan Esfandiary derived from his visit to London was,7 doubtless, one of the causes of a sensible and calming speech which he made in the Majlis at the conclusion of an angry debate on foreign criticisms of Iran, a subject dealt with in paragraph 126 of this report. (1) United Kingdom and India, (a) General. 22. Early in the year, the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, about to proceed to take up the position of Iranian Minister in London, informed His Majesty’s Minister that the Minister for Foreign Affairs would wish to speak to him before long about negotiating a new treaty; this was apparently to take the form of a treaty of friendship couched in general terms, and was desired chiefly for reasons of amour yrojpre : the Iranian Government already had several treaties of this kind with other States, and thought it unfitting that relations with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom should still rest mainly on the treaty of 1857, much of which was entirely out of date. 23. His Majesty’s Minister responded sympathetically, referred to the danger of trying to include too much in a treaty, and mentioned the inconveniences that had arisen in the past from the unwillingness of the Iranian Government to recognise the treaties between His Majesty’s Government and the Arab sheikhs on the Persian Gulf. 24. M. Soheily gave a rather indefinite impression that his Government might not be immovable in this connexion. It appeared that the Iranian Govern ment had in mind the marking out on the ground of the existing frontier in Baluchistan, and the conclusion of a Consular Convention. M. Soheily made it clear that the Iranian Government would not in his opinion be willing to consider settling any of the long outstanding financial claims against them except as part of a general settlement. 25. The Foreign Office agreed that in the event of the Iranian Ministry for Foreign Affairs raising the question of a treaty with His Majesty’s Minister, the latter should respond sympathetically, asking what lines M. Samiy had in mind, and deprecating the inclusion of too many items. In addition to giving an indication of their general attitude towards a treaty, to be used at discretion if the matter were raised again, the Foreign Office referred to the two subjects suggested by M. Soheily. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom preferred that no Consular Convention should be attempted and the Government of India shared this view. As regards the Baluchistan frontier, His Majesty’s Minister was authorised to tell M. Samiy that, while His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India saw no objection in principle to the Iranian proposal, they were not convinced that the expense and effort entailed by a full demarcation would be justified in the conditions existing on this particular frontier. The Foreign Office further informed His Majesty’s Minister of the section of frontier on which the work of demarcation, if undertaken, should be begun. Subsequently the Government of India intimated that they did not wish to be committed to any demarcation of the Baluchistan frontier until they had details of what the Iranian Government proposed. His Majesty’s Minister being in possession of these views, it was agreed to leave to his discretion how best to respond to any further suggestion as regards demarcation. 26. Actually the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs did not on any occasion raise the question of a treaty with His Majesty’s Minister. The only further development was in London. In the course of his first conversation as Iranian Minister with Sir L. Oliphant in April, M. Soheily reverted to the desirability of a treaty of friendship, the existing one, concluded when the Persians were in occupation of Herat and the British of Bushire, being out of date. M. Soheily agreed that the work involved in the forthcoming Coronation made the immediate inauguration of any fresh treaty negotiations untimely, but enquired whether the matter could not be pursued by His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran. Sir L. Oliphant agreed that this was a possible eventual solution, but pointed out that His Majesty’s Minister would require instructions from London; for the time being it was necessary to go slow. [16966] b 427. No subsequent instructions were sent to His Majesty’s Minister, the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom being that the initiative could continue to be left to the Iranian Government. (b) Persian Gulf. Lighting and Buoying. 28. The negotiations for the conclusion of a protocol transferring to the Iranian Government the lights, buoys and beacons maintained by the Govern ment of India on Iranian territory and in Iranian waters, which had proceeded at a leisurely pace in 1935 and 1936, were brought to an abrupt conclusion by the Iranian Government in August with an oral intimation to His Majesty’s Legation that they would henceforth undertake responsibility for the necessary installations, and a request that the necessary steps would be taken forthwith to remove the lights and buoys belonging to the Persian Gulf Lighting Service. This referred to the lights in Iranian territory and waters. In short, it appeared that the Iranian Government no longer wished to buy the British lights, make use of Sir J. Ward’s services, or to conclude a protocol on the transfer. 29. This intimation came five months after His Majesty’s Legation had communicated to the Iranian Ministry for Foreign Affairs the views of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom on a letter from the Ministry of the previous year. In a private letter to M. Ansarie, dated the 13th March, Mr. Butler had intimated that His Majesty’s Government were ready to meet the Iranian Government on various points of form and of substance, and he had sought to obtain assurances in writing on three points on which the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government had felt anxiety, namely co-operation of the Iranian authorities with British shipowners, the payment in lieu of dues to be made by the Admiralty in respect of Admiralty oilers, and the limitation of lighting dues on vessels generally so as to cover expenditure, and not to produce revenue. 30. After the receipt of the abrupt communication referred to. His Majesty’s Minister discussed the matter with the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. M. Adi confirmed the intentions of the Iranian Government, but promised that a reply should be sent to Mr. Butler’s letter. His Majesty’s Minister expressed surprise and regret at the Iranian Government’s decision and laid stress on the importance of securing continuity in the service and of allowing time for any changes in the lighting to be brought to the notice of shipping; there was a real danger that disturbance to shipping might lead to increased freights and costs of insurance. 31. M. Adi seemed alive to the importance of these points, but shortly afterwards the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company complained that new lights at Qais Island and Bushire were exhibiting intermittently without any notice having been given to shipping, and the Persian Gulf Lighting Service had to issue a warning on the subject. Also His Majesty’s Legation were instructed to make the necessary representations to the Iranian Government. In this connexion, M. Ansarie stated that it was now proposed to ask for the removal of the existing British lights successively, as each new light was completed by the Iranian Government, and not before. 32. In November instructions were received from the Foreign Office to inform the Iranian Government that the Government of India regretted a decision which meant that the time and trouble already taken in working out a scheme at the Iranian Government’s own request would be wasted, but were prepared to remove the lights and buoys in question when the new Iranian installations were in place and found adequate to meet the requirements of shipping. The Government of India also suggested that the settlement of outstanding points regarding the removal of the present lights and the substitution of a service administered by the Iranian Government might most satisfactorily be arranged by qualified experts from both sides meeting for the purpose. 33. His Majesty’s Minister, in carrying out these instructions, seeing that the promised reply had not yet been received to Mr. Butler’s letter, explained to M. Adi that he could make a verbal reply only to the verbal communication ofthe Minister, but he left with him a note of the views of the Government of India. M. Adi seemed doubtful whether the competent Iranian authorities would consider a meeting of experts to be necessary. 34. Meanwhile, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India were in agreement that it was very important that a complete chain of route lights in the Persian Gulf should be retained under British control, and that, with this in view, the lighting of the Stiffe Bank should be put into effect as soon as possible, particularly as the Iranian Government were known to contemplate putting a light there. At the end of the year the Government of India and Sir J. Ward, representing the Persian Gulf Lighting- Service, had not reached agreement as to the most suitable light to move to the Stiffe Bank as a temporary measure. 35. His Majesty’s Legation received from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in July and December notices as to the installation of a naval and aerial light at Bush ire and of a lighthouse on Qais Island respectively, together with certain information about it. At the request of the External Affairs Department in Delhi, His Majesty’s Legation asked for further particulars as to the height above high water and the candle-power of these and future Iranian lights, and requested also that at least one month’s prior notice might be given before these lights entered into service. Visits of His Majesty’s Ships to Iranian Ports. 36. A considerable number of unofficial visits to Iranian ports were made during the year by the four sloops of the Persian Gulf Division. The procedure for the notification of these visits through the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, instituted in March 1936, worked smoothly on the whole. Some correspondence with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs was necessary to clear up minor points, such as the order in which calls were to be paid. In spite of the categorical assurance given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the previous year that instructions would always be sent to the local authorities in good time, on more than one occasion the instructions were received at the last moment, or even after the ship had arrived. Serious inconvenience was only caused on one occasion, at the very end of the year, when H.M.S. Bideford arrived at Abadan on the 27th December to find that no communication with the shore was permitted because the local authorities had received no instructions about the visit. Instructions were sent from Tehran on the same day. The delay was probably due to one of the frequent changes of personnel at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. In general, the local authorities at Abadan, where the majority of the visits were made, appear to have been consistently friendly and helpful. Colonel Bayendor, the commander of the Iranian Naval Forces in the South, who during the early part of the year at least gave much trouble to the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company and local foreign shipping interests, was always helpful in connexion with naval visits. In particular, all the local authorities gave friendly assistance when H.M.S. Bideford was damaged in a collision with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s floating dock while turning in the Shatt-al-Arab during a visit to Abadan at the end of February. The visit had been changed from an ordinary one to an urgent visit for fuelling only, notified through His Majesty’s vice-consul at Khorramshahr, because it was thought that the Shah might be at Abadan or Khorramshahr at the time. The ship should therefore have left immediately fuelling had been completed, and no landing would normally have been permitted. The local authorities made no difficulty over allowing the ship to remain until the damage had been repaired; they also permitted two seamen to be landed for urgent X-ray examination. The Shah did not, in fact, visit Khuzistan till a month later. Visits to Abadan had been planned for H.M.S. Fowey and H.M.S. Deptford at the end of March, but both His Majesty’s consul at Ahwaz and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company considered it undesirable that they should be made while the Shah was in the neighbourhood. His movements being uncertain, and all Iranians on edge, an unfortunate incident with the ‘Iranian navy seemed possible. The visits were therefore cancelled. 37. The only other untoward incident in connexion with the visit of one of His Majesty’s ships to an Iranian port occurred at Bushire, which port [16966] c*10 H.M.S. Shoreham was due to visit on-the 1st August. A few days earlier the Governor of Bushire informed the Secretary to the Political Resident that he expected to receive a salute of nineteen guns, instead of the thirteen guns normally accorded to him, and that unless he received the salute demanded he would return the senior naval officer’s call on land, and not on board the ship. A salute of nineteen guns could not, of course, be granted without the sanction of His Majesty the King. The Governor’s demand was referred to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, but it proved impossible to obtain a decision by the 1st August, and the senior naval officer had no alternative but to cancel his visit to Bushire. At the end of September the Ministry for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Legation that the Governor should only receive a salute of thirteen guns as before, and that if the Iranian Government saw any reason to ask for a change at Bushire or elsewhere, the matter would be raised through the diplomatic channel. 38. H.M.S. Enterprise, of the Fourth Cruiser Squadron, East Indies, visited Abadan and Bushire in October. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs at first appeared puzzled by the visit of a ship not forming part of the Persian Gulf Division, but made no difficulty when it was explained that it was usual for a cruiser from the East Indies station to visit the Persian Gulf each year. The visit to Abadan passed off without incident, and it was evident that the local authorities made every effort to be as friendly as possible. 39. During the year the attitude of the Iranian Government with regard to the landing of seamen requiring urgent medical attention became more accommodating than it had previously been (see paragraph 19 of the 1936 report). Repeated efforts were made to obtain an assurance in writing that His Majesty’s ships would be allowed to call at Iranian ports, without prior notification, to land urgent medical cases. It became evident that the Iranian Government had no intention of giving any such assurance in writing, or of making any alteration in their published regulations. But the representations made by His Majesty’s Legation were not without effect. At the end of May the head of the European Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs assured the counsellor of His Majesty’s Legation that the local authorities were aware that the necessity of landing an urgent medical case constituted an instance of force majeure, which would justify a breach of the regulations requiring prior notification of a visit by a foreign warship. Local enquiries showed, at first, that both the Governors of Abadan and Bushire were still in some doubt on the subject. Colonel Bayendor, however, appeared to have received the required instructions, which he passed on to the Governor of Abadan, while the Governor of Bushire also subsequently agreed that an urgent medical case could be landed without prior notification. By the end of the year it was evident that there was nothing to be gained by further representations. 40. In 1936 the Iranian Government had protested at the visit of the troopship Dorsetshire to Abadan for fuelling without prior notification. They were informed in reply that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had no objection to notifying such visits if the Iranian Government so desired. The Admiralty were anxious to ensure that no calls should be exchanged on such visits, in order to safeguard the position of Admiralty oilers, which might be treated as warships if troopships were so treated. His Majesty’s Legation were therefore instructed to make an arrangement with the Iranian Government accordingly. The matter was discussed with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and a note was subsequently received stating that the Iranian Government agreed that no calls should be exchanged on the occasion of visits of troopships “ having no cadre of naval officers,” which was taken to mean not being under the control of naval officers. The reply was regarded as satisfactory. Iranian Navy. 41. At the beginning of the year the Iranian navy threatened to become active in interfering with Arab dhows on the high seas and even in Arab terri torial waters, and several protests to the Iranian Government were necessary regarding the cases of which details are given in paragraphs 45-51 below. But after the end of February no further cases were reported, and the ships of the Iranian navy continued to spend the greater part of their time at their moorings[16966] c * 2 11 in the Karim at Khorramshahr. The Shah inspected his navy during his visit to Khuzistan in March. On the 20th March he sailed from Khorramshahr to Bandar Shahpur on H.I.M.S. Palang, accompanied by H.I.M.S. Babr. The usual visit to Bombay for repairs was not made in 1937, doubtless because the Iranian navy now possessed its own floating-dock moored at Bandar Shahpur. But it is doubtful whether the naval authorities were actually able to use it for repairs to their vessels. Rumours were current at one time that the dock was to be moored at Bushire, but it seemed likely that the proposal, if it was ever made, arose simply from Colonel Bayendor’s desire to forestall any suggestion that he should transfer his base to Bandar Shahpur, where living conditions would be extremelv bad. Colonel Bayendor remained in command of the naval forces of the south throughout the year. His relations with His Majesty’s ships and with His Majesty’s vice-consulate at Khorramshahr were on the whole friendly and helpful^ He was, however, responsible for the troublesome complaints described in paragraphs 42-44 below, about the uniforms of the launch crews of His Majesty’s consulate-general at Bushire and of His Majesty’s vice-consulate at Khorramshahr. In the early part of the year he continued, as he had previously done, to give a great deal of trouble to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and other foreign interests by his interference in all matters affecting the ports of Khorram shahr and Abadan, the navigation of the Karun, the municipality of Khorram shahr, the conscription of Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s employees, &amp;c. The Shah seems to have been somewhat dissatisfied with the navy when he visited Khorramshahr, and although Colonel Bayendor retained his command, his confidence in his position appears to have been shaken, for after the Shah’s visit there was a noticeable and very welcome improvement in his attitude to local British interests. Uniforms of Launch Crews at Bushire and Khorramshahr. 42. Colonel Bayendor was responsible for two trivial but tiresome complaints about the uniforms worn by the launch crews of His Majesty’s consulate-general at Bush ire, and by the launch crews and ferrashes of His Majesty’s vice-consulate at Khorramshahr. The complaint in each case was that the launch crews’ uniforms could be easily confused with those of the Iranian navy, while in the case of Khorramshahr objection was also taken to the ferrashes’ uniforms as being of a “ colonial or military type.” At Khorramshahr the objection to the launch crews’ uniforms was later withdrawn, and the complaint about those of the ferrashes was fairly easily met by minor changes. 43. The complaint with regard to the uniforms of the launch crew at Bushire was more serious, and threatened to develop into a tiresome dispute. The matter had been first raised in May 1936, special objection being taken to the use of a collar bearing three stripes which closely resembled the uniform of the Iranian navy. It was explained to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that there was, in fact, a considerable difference between the two uniforms, but the Ministry of War maintained their attitude. To make any confusion of the two uniforms impossible, the Political Resident put his crew into peaked caps instead of sailor hats, and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs were informed accordingly. Nothing more was said in Tehran, but on the 3rd March, while Sir Trenchard Fowle was absent on tour, the Secretary to the Political Resident received a letter from the Governor of Bushire stating that it had been decided in Tehran that the three stripes should be removed from the collars of the uniforms, and asking that this should be done. He was informed that nothing was known of any agreement to remove the stripes. On the 13th March .the Governor sent for the head Munshi of the consulate-general, and in the presence of the Iranian naval officer in charge at Bushire, sent a message to Major Ryan that instructions had been received from Colonel Bayendor to remove the three lines of braid, and that unless these were removed by the time the Shah visited Bushire at the end of March they would be removed forcibly. 44. The matter was referred to the Foreign Office, and the launch crew were put into undress during the Shah’s visit. Instructions were received at the end of March that the uniforms should be altered as requested, but that an expression of regret should be obtained for the offensive manner in which the Governor conveyed his request. His Majesty’s Minister, therefore, called on the head of the European Department on the 1st April and protested strongly at the actionof the Governor in sending his message to Major Ryan while the matter was undei (discussion in Tehran. M. Ansarie was profuse in his apologies. But no apo ogy was made by the Governor. Eventually, after much pressure from His Majesty s Legation, when Colonel Fowle was calling on the Governor for another purpose on the 31st May, the latter raised this quesfion and, though still maintaining tna he had never sent the message complained of, expressed his regret at the misun er- standing. At Sir Trenchard Fowle’s suggestion it was decided that this should be regarded as closing the incident. Interference with Arab Dhows. 45. On the 25th January a Koweiti dhow named the Furat, bound for Gwadur, was taking shelter from a strong easterly wind in Khassab Bay when she was stopped about a mile from the shore by an Iranian gunboat, believed o have been the Babr. The dhow carried a cargo of some 2,600 pieces of silk, but her manifest showed her cargo as nil. The Iranian gunboat theietoie airese the dhow and towed her to Lingah, where she was detained with her crew. Mis Majesty’s consul at Kerman was able to arrange for the consulate interpreter at Bandar Abbas to go to Lingah at the end of February, and to obtain from the nakhuda an exact statement of the dhow’s position when seized, about whicn there had been considerable doubt. The dhow and her crew were released on the 28th February and left for Debai. The interpreter s report left little doubt that the purpose of the dhow’s voyage was to smuggle the cargo of silk into India through some small port in Baluchistan. 46. On the same day, the 25th January, the Babr stopped and searched in Muscat territorial waters near the Quoins two out of three Debai dhows sailing in company to the Batineh coast. The cargoes of both dhows were searched, being prodded with a steel prong, and the baggage and clothing of the passengers were also searched. Nothing incriminating was found. One of the passengers, who was going to marry a daughter of the Sheikh of Kalba, had with him 600 icun s of ammunition as a present to his future father-in-law, but these were jettisoned when the gunboat was sighted. After the search the dhows were allowed to proceed. 47 On the 16th February a Debai jolly-boat, sailing from Khassab to l)ebai with a cargo of dried fish, was overtaken and stopped when 1 mile off Ghamda on the Arab coast by an Iranian warship believed to have been the Shahrokh. The nakhuda was ordered to go aboard the warship, where he was questioned about the nationality of his boat, himself and his crew. He was then allowed to proceed without his boat being seaiched. 48 At the end of March a report was received from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf stating that on or about the 8th February a Koweiti sambuk had been seized by Iranian customs officials m Iraqi territorial waters m th Shatt-el-Arab off Qusbeh. The boat had carried a cargo of shingle to Abadan and was returning empty when it was detained at Qusbeh, apparently on the o-ronnd that the nakhuda, who like all the crew was an Iranian subject, was evading Iranian dues A security of 6,000 rials was taken , from him to ensure that he g did not leave. From the actual statements of the crew it appeared doubtful whether the boat was actually seized in Iraqi territorial waters, and investigation b v His Majesty’s vice-consul at Khorramshahr showed that the boat when seized was in fact drawn up on the shore at Qusbeh and was being cleaned. The customs authorit^s at Qusbeh therefore accused the Iranian nakhuda of buying and fmporting 8 a &amp; foreign boat without an import licence or the payment of duty ¥hey wefe apparently eventually satisfied of the boat’s Koweiti nationality and the boat was released early in April. 49 Owing to the time taken for reports of some of these incidents to reach His Majesty’s Legation, and to further delays due to uncertainty on the al - important 8 point of the dhow’s position when seized or stopped some weeks i ^ i in Jar*h rase before any action could be taken m lehran. In the case of elapsed ir } , 1 V f i pta i ne( i a t Qusbeh, owing to the uncertainty about the facts o/the^fzure His Majesty’s Minister confined himself, in his note to the Ministry for Fote^n Affairs to a request for the boat’s release and an enquiry about the for loie g , ’ • strong protests were made regarding the other three cases^escribed above, the note regarding the dhow detained at Lingah being13 handed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs by His Majesty’s Minister on the 16th March. No written reply was ever received to these notes. Nor, in spite of a number of reminders during the year, was any reply received to the protest made by His Majesty’s Legation about the very bad case which occurred off Lingah in May 1936, when an Iranian customs launch fired without warning on a Koweiti dhow, wounding three of the crew. 50. Captain Poland, who had recently taken over the appointment of senior naval officer, Persian Gulf, visited Tehran in the middle of April, and the opportunity was taken to discuss with him the situation arising out of the recent activity of Iranian warships in interfering with Arab dhows and the failure of the Iranian Government to reply to the representations made to them. As a result of these discussions His Majesty’s Minister decided to recommend to the Foreign Office that if no satisfactory reply was received within a reasonable time, the Iranian Government should be officially warned that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom could not, in view of their treaties with the Arab rulers, acquiesce in the continued arrests of Arab dhows on the high seas and in Aral) waters, and that orders had therefore been given to His Majesty’s ships to prevent any such arrest, should one of them be present when the arrest was being made. 51. By the end of May no definite reply had been received from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, though M. Ansarie, the head of the European Department, had stated orally that orders were being issued to Iranian ships not to interfere with Arab dhows in Arab territorial waters. No mention was made or the high seas, and His Majesty’s Minister therefore saw the Minister for Foreign Affairs and M. Adi, the Director-General of the Ministry, on the 22nd May, and impressed on them the importance of giving an assurance covering the high seas. On the 12th June M. Adi told Mr. Seymour that definite instructions had now been issued to Iranian warships not to stop Arab vessels on the high seas The value of this assurance was, however, somewhat diminished by the fact that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs continued to maintain that two of the incidents which occurred in Arab waters actually took place in Iranian territorial waters, though they could produce no evidence to support their views. His Majesty’s Legation continued to contest the view of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and to press lor specific replies regarding each case. But M. Ansarie maintained that the various cases should be considered as closed by the general assurance given to Mr. Seymour by M. Adi. As by the end of July no further cases had occurred, it was then decided not to pursue the individual protests which had been made. No further incidents were reported to His Majesty’s Legation during the year, apart from the quite different case of the Bahrein dhow which was forced to take out Iranian registration papers (see paragraph 53 below). It may, therefore, be hoped that the representations made by His Majesty’s Legation were not without effect. Muscat, Bahrein and Koweit Proclamations. 52. In February the recurrence of interference with Arab dhows by Iranian warships led the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to suggest that it was desirable to withdraw the Muscat Arms Proclamation of 1898, which gives the Iranian Government the right to search Muscat vessels on the high seas, and the Bahrein and Koweit Proclamations of 1898 and 1900, which give Iranian ships the right to search vessels of the notifying Ruler in Iranian waters, Indian waters and the waters of the Ruler concerned. The Political Resident feared that the Iranian Government might justify interference with Arab dhows by saying that they had been stopped to verify whether they were Muscat dhows. His suggestion was supported by the Government of India. It was, however, pointed out by the Admiralty that the Iranian Government did not seem to be aware of the existence of the proclamations, and that if their attention were drawn to them by their withdrawal they might retaliate by withdrawing the Iranian firman of 1897, which gave to His Majesty’s ships in the Persian Gulf the right to search Iranian merchant ships in the Gulf. The loreign Office expressed the view that nothing was to be gained by withdrawing the proclama tions in question until the Iranian Government became aware of them and appealed to them. His Majesty’s Minister, whose opinion was invited, pointed out that since Sir Trenchard Fowle’s proposal had been made interference had ceased, at least temporarily, and that the Iranian Government had given an assurance that their ships would not interfere with any Arab vessels on the high 116966] c * 3AMORP 14 seas, which meant that they would not avail themselves of their right to search Muscat vessels on the high seas. Further, the recent conversations on the subject had confirmed the view that the Iranian Government were unaware of the existence of the proclamations. He therefore deprecated the withdrawal of the proclamations at present. The proposal was not pursued. Bahrein. 53. The Iranian Government’s policy of protesting at anything which they regarded as an infringement of their sovereignty over Bahrein was vigorously maintained during the year. In February the Bahrein Government enacted a Nationality Law and a law regarding the ownership of immovable property in Bahrein by foreigners. The main object of these laws was to retaliate for the treatment of Bahrainis in Iran. The effect of the Nationality Law was to assimilate to Bahrein nationality the large number of persons born in Bahrein of Iranian parents, unless they preserved their Iranian nationality by registering at the Political Agency. In the Property Laws, the Bahrein Government reserved to themselves the right to adopt the principle of reciprocity towards foreigners in the matter of their ownership of immovable property in Bahrein. It was intended that the Bahrein Government should subsequently publish a notice applying the law to Iranian nationals in Bahrein. 54. On the 13th June the Iranian Government protested against the enact ment of these laws in a note stating that they were contrary to the sovereignty of Iran over Bahrein, and that they could not in any way impair the rights of the Iranian Government. As on the occasion of the Iranian protest in 1936 at an exchange of notes between His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Jedda and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Saudia Arabia regarding the levy of transit dues at Bahrein, a brief reply was sent on the 9th September, stating that the views of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom on the subject had been set out on many occasions, and notably in a note addressed to Hovannes Khan Mossaed on'the 18th February, 1929. The intended notification applying the Bahrein Property Law to Iranian subjects in Bahrein was published on the 1st November. In a note dated the 28th December the Iranian Government duly protested against the notification, stating that it was now clear that the sole object of the Property Law was to impose restrictions on the ownership of property by non-Bahreini Iranians who had settled in the islands. A simple acknowledgment only of this note had been sent by the end of the year. 55. At the beginning of December the Iranian Minister in Bagdad informed the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs that his Government understood that the Sheikh of Bahrein proposed shortly to visit Bagdad to discuss questions of common interest with the Iraqi Government. The Iranian Minister said that he had been instructed to inform the Iraqi Government that his Government would hold participation of the Iraqi Government in any such discussions to be an act unbecoming in a friendly neighbour State. The Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that the sheikh was not coming to Bagdad, and that in any case the Iraqi Government were not concerned with the dispute between the Iranian Government and His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom about Bahrein. 56. On the 25th September the nakhuda of a Bahreini dhow at Khorramshahr was informed by the Iranian naval authorities that he should register the dhow there. He replied that he must refer to the owner. The naval authorities kept his Bahrein registration papers and told him not to leave Khorramshahr. On the 3rd October they issued to him a set of Iranian registra tion papers, and the dhow sailed on the 8th October under Iranian papers. The action of the naval authorities was the logical outcome of their claim to Bahrein, and it was clear that no representations would lead the Iranian Government to modify their standing instructions regarding Bahreini dhows in their ports. A formal note of protest only was therefore addressed to the Iranian Govern ment on the 16th November, and the sheikh was advised to warn owners of dhows that in their own interests they should avoid calls at Iranian ports as far as possible. On the 12th December the Iranian Government replied to His Majesty’s Minister’s note of protest, restating the view that Bahrein was an inalienable part of Iran and saying that they regarded the protest as unjustifiable.[16966] c* 4 wtamm 15 Abu Musa and Tamb. 57. On the 10th June M. Ansarie referred in conversation with a member of the staff of His Majesty’s Legation to the protest made by the Iranian Govern ment in 1935 against the action of the Sheikh of Sharjah in granting to a British company a concession for the extraction of red oxide from the island of Abu Musa, which is claimed by the Iranian Government. M. Ansarie said that the Iranian Government had recently received further reports of the activities of the company, and that he had therefore been instructed by his Minister to make a further protest against what the Iranian Government considered to be an undoubted breach of the status quo agreement. Two days later M. Ansarie made a similar communication to His Majesty’s Minister. Mr. Seymour reminded M. Ansarie of the reply made to the Iranian Government’s protest in 1935, namely, that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had never admitted the Iranian claim to the island, and that they could not agree that there had been any breach of the status quo agreement. This agreement could not be held to preclude an occupant of any territory from proceeding with the normal commercial development of the territory in his possession. The Iranian Govern ment’s renewed protest was reported to the Foreign Office, and M. Ansarie was informed on the 9th September that His Majesty’s Government had nothing to add to the reply given in 1935. 58. It was decided during the year that His Majesty’s Government had no reason to object to the Sheikh of Rais-al-Khaimah granting to the same British company a concession for the extraction of red oxide from the island of Tamb. Visas and Endorsements for Arab States. 59. For some years the Iranian Government have consistently refused to recognise any passports bearing visas or endorsements for Bahrein and less consistently for Koweit. During 1937 they decided to extend this treatment to passports bearing visas or endorsements for any of the Arab States in the Persian Gulf. Early in the year two cases were reported in which the Iranian consul at Karachi had refused to grant visas to members of the staffs of His Majesty’s consulates-general for Khorassan and at Bushire respectively, because their passports bore endorsements for Muscat. Entry permits were, however, given on separate pieces of paper. At the beginning of August the Political Resident reported that a British Indian clerk on his staff, who had been transferred to Muscat, had been refused an exit visa by the Bushire police because his passport was endorsed for Muscat. The difficulty was met by the issue of another passport. A month later His Majesty’s consul at Kerman reported that a British Indian trader resident at Bandar Abbas was to be deported because he had returned from India with a passport endorsed for Debai. His Majesty’s legation were able to arrange for instructions to be sent that he should be allowed to remain at Bandar Abbas, since he had no knowledge of the new regulations, but he had already left when the instructions were received. The local authorities, however, agreed to allow him to return. Repeated efforts were made to obtain a copy of the new regulations, and the importance of publishing regulations of this type was impressed on the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Finally, on the 10th December, the new head of the European Department, M. Zanjani, stated that instructions had in fact been issued forbidding the recognition of passports bearing visas or endorsements for any of the Arab States on the Persian Gulf. M. Zanjani gave no precise information about the new regulations, but said that the instructions would not be published and that no written reply would be sent to the enquiries made by His Majesty’s Legation. The desirabilily of protesting against the new regulations was under consideration at the end of the year. Arms Traffic. 60. Reports were received from time to time during the year that arms were being smuggled on a small scale from Muscat through the small ports in Iranian Mekran, and also from Koweit through ports such as Hindijian, Ganawah, Bandar’Riy and Lingah. On the 18th May the head of the European Depart ment of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs said that a report had been received that certain Iranian subjects were travelling with arms between Iran and Muscat. The Iranian Government considered it most important to stop this happening, and asked for the assistance of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdommam wmm 16 in this matter. Though the information given by M. Ansarie was exceedingly vague, it seemed desirable to meet this request as sympathetically as possible. After reference to the Foreign Office, the Minister for horeign Affairs was informed in a private letter from His Majesty s Minister, dated the 17th June, that it had always been a concern of His Majesty’s Government to prevent illicit arms traffic in the Persian Gulf and that they would be glad to take any action that might be possible to stop the carrying of arms between Iran and Muscat. But to make such action as effective as possible, His Majesty s Government would be glad to have detailed information about the traffic which was believed to be taking place. Mr. Seymour suggested that in order to make the exchange of information as rapid as possible, the details required should be communicated by the Ministry of War direct to the military attache. The first response to this letter was a statement made by M. Ansarie on the 24th Julv to the effect that in March three persons had gone from Charbar to Muscat and returned with contraband arms, and that three other persons were in the habit of travelling between Charbar and Muscat and were suspected of smuggling arms. This meagre and out-of-date information was communicated to the Political Resident for such action as might be possible. On the 24th September M. Ansarie referred in conversation to Mr. Seymour’s letter of the 17th June to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, which appears to have been construed as an invitation to concert measures for general co-operation in the arms traffic, although, on the instructions of the Foreign Office, Mr. Seymour had been careful to avoid any suggestion that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were unable to suppress the arms traffic without the assistance of the Iranian Government. M. Ansarie was at pains to explain that in raising this question he had not had in mind any general co-operation, since this must be the subject of a special agreement. He had only been concerned with a particular instance concerning Muscat. No reference was made to the communication of information direct to the military attache, and no further request for assistance had been received by the end of the year. / Cable and Wireless Communications in the Persian Gulf. 61. In 1935 Cable and Wireless (Limited) decided on a reorganisation of their Persian Gulf cable system, which would involve the closure of their stations at Jask, Henjam and Charbar, so that the Karachi-Bushire cable would go direct from Muscat to Bushire without any intermediate landing on Iranian soil. At the request of the Iranian Government, the company agreed to keep the cable station at Jask open for two years from December 1935 to allow time for the construction of a land line to Jask. At the end of 1936 an opportunity had been taken to ask the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs how the construction of this line was progressing. Early in January 1937, a reply was received from him stating that his Ministry were doing their best to complete the land line within the two-year period, and that work on it would shortly begin. His letter also contained a very friendly expression of appreciation of the assistance given by the company to the Iranian Government. M. Hikmat was always helpful in matters concerned with the company, and his death shortly afterwards was much regretted. A further enquiry regarding the completion of the land line to Jask was addressed to the Acting Minister in July. He replied that the Iranian Government had decided not to build a land line, but to maintain telegraphic communication with Jask by wireless, and that the necessary wireless installations at Jask and Bushire should be ready in time to allow the company to close their station in December. Official confirmation that the company might leave Jask in December was obtained at the beginning of October. The company subse quently stated that it was uncertain when the cable-ship, which was required to join up the cable at sea on the closure of the Jask station, could visit the Persian Gulf, and that they might wish to keep the Jask station open till June 1938. This delay might have proved awkward, but on the 26th December His Majesty’s Legation were informed that the cable-ship should reach the Persian Gulf very shortly. 62. For many years the company had operated a wireless transmitting set at their cable-station at Bushire without objection being raised by the Iranian Government, although the company’s concession made no provision for the opera tion of wireless stations. The Iranian Government completed their own wireless■HHMHRV [16966] d* 17 station at Bushire during 1937, and at the end of September a request was received that the company should cease to work their wireless set when the Iranian station was ready to function. The company had no option but to comply, but in any case they were quite ready to close down their wireless installation, and this was done on the 22nd November. 63. In April some trouble was caused by the tests of the Iranian wireless station at Jask. On the 17th and 18th April this station was repoited to have transmitted continuously and aimlessly, completely interfering with the communication between aeroplanes of Imperial Airways and the wireless stations at Gwadur and Sharjah, and thus causing serious danger to aeroplanes requiring weather reports and bearings. The transmission from Jask was on a wave-length of 900 metres, reserved under the Madrid. Telecommunications Convention for aeronautical communication. An aide-memoire was left with the Director-General at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the 23rd April, pointing out that grave danger to human life had been caused and requesting that urgent instructions should be sent to the Jask station to refrain from inter fering with other stations. On the 3rd May the Government of India informed His Majesty’s Legation that the testing of the Jask station, which had caused the interference, had ceased, and that the station was now carrying out ordinary communication with aircraft of the Dutch K.L.M. only. On the 2nd June an aide-memoire was received from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs stating that tests on the wave-length of 900 metres had been necessary because the station was intended for communication with aircraft, but that the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs regretted that no notice had been given of the intended tests and that the tests had been unduly prolonged. Such an expression of regret from the Iranian Government is an extremely rare occurrence. Lingah Wireless Apparatus. 64. In April the head of the European Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs asked whether the wireless apparatus at Lingah belonging to the Government of India, which had been disused for eight years, might be handed over to the Iranian Government. A similar request had been made in 1932, when the Iranian Government were informed that the matter was one to be included in a general treaty. The request was repeated in 1935, when it was decided to inform the Iranian Government that the Government of India were ready to sell the apparatus, but no action was taken as the Ministry for Foreign Affairs did not pursue the matter. The Government of India were anxious to get rid of the apparatus, which was of no value, and on which they had been incurring useless expenditure for a number of years. The Iranian Government were therefore informed in November that the Government of India would be glad to hand over the apparatus without charge. The Iranian Government were at the same time reminded that the transmitting apparatus was of a type the use of which had been forbidden by international regulation. Meteorological Services. 65. In 1936 the Government of India raised the question of the lack of meteorological information from the section of the north coast of the Persian Gulf stretching 5 from Bushire to Charbar, due to the closing of the observatory hitherto maintained by Cable and Wireless (Limited) at Henjam, and the imminent closing of that at Jask. Unofficial discussions showed that the Iranian Government were interested in the subject, and in November 1936 the Ministry for Foreign Affairs were informed that the Government of India would be glad to present to the Iranian Government the set of instruments hitherto used at Henjam. A suggestion was made at the same time that they should be used somewhere in the same neighbourhood. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs were also informed that the Government of India would be happy to assist in the establishment of a meteorological service in Iran. No reply regarding the Henjam instruments was received until February 1937, when the Ministry for Foreign Affairs asked for a list of the instruments, and at the same time expressed the fear that they might be out of date. A list was received in June from the Government of India and sent to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs with the explanation that, though old, the instruments were still serviceable. No reply was received and no steps were taken to hand over the instruments before the end of the year.18 66. Meanwhile, the Government of India proceeded with the establishment of a new observatory at Bandar Abbas. The Iranian Government were informed of their intention and raised no objection. At the same time, the Government of India informed His Majesty’s Legation that it was proposed to send an inspector to visit the observatories at Jask, Charbar and Bushire. 1 he Ministry for Foreign Affairs were informed and raised no obstacle. They asked for full information about the inspector’s tour in case the Ministry of Posts and tele graphs wished to get in touch with him. The Government of India replied that they did not think the officer whom they had intended to send sufficiently qualified to discuss matters with the Iranian Government, but that, if the Iranian Govern ment really wished to consult an expert, one could be sent in addition to the inspector. On the 12th August the Iranian Government replied to this that they did not wish at present to consult an expert on general meteorological questions. They wished, however, to engage a meteorological expert to instruct the officers of the Iranian navy in (a) meteorology, and (b) marine survey work. 67. This was an entirely new proposal. It was amplified in a letter from the Under-Secretary at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the 2nd September, in which it was explained that the Iranian Government wished to engage an expert qualified (a) to prepare a scheme for the establishment of meteorological services for the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, and the inauguration of the necessary observatories; (b) to give lectures to naval officers on meteorological services and hydrography; (c) to give practical instruction in marine survey work and to prepare any charts of Iranian ports, &amp;c., which might be necessary. It seemed most important to seize this unexpected opportunity of co-operation with the Iranian navy. The Government of India were unable to provide an officer with the desired qualifications, but on the 15th November His Majesty’s Legation were authorised to inform the Iranian Government that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom hoped to be able to recommend a suitable candidate qualified to fulfil the combined functions indicated by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs as soon as definite information about the conditions of service was available and provided these were satisfactory. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs were informed accordingly. On the 25th December they replied asking what salary and conditions of service the expert would expect. Thus by the end of the year no progress had been made with the arrangements for the appointment. Meanwhile, the Government of India’s inspector was touring the observatories in the Persian Gulf region. Bushire Residency. 68. In December the Iranian consul-general at Delhi, in a note to the Government of India, called attention to the publication in the press of an announcement that Sir Trenchard Fowle had resumed his duties as Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. M. Nourzad asked that, if this announcement was due to an error in the Gazette of India, the error might be corrected, since a repetition of it might cause the Iranian Government to protest, seeing they did not recognise Sir T. Fowle’s designation as Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. No other allusion to the Political Resident’s position at Bushire was made during the year by the Iranian Government or Iranian representatives, nor did the Iranian Government refer to the proposal to move the Political Residency to Bahrein, of which they had heard in 1936 (see paragraph 39 of the 1936 report). But a number of incidents which had to be referred to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs served as reminders of the vulnerability of the Residency’s position. The only case in which the action of the Iranian authorities was aimed directly at the Residency was that of the complaint about the launch crews’ uniforms described in paragraphs 42- 44 above. But much inconvenience was caused by visa restrictions affecting members of the Residency staff, and by the refusal of permission to visit ships at the Bushire anchorage, on which the Residency staff largely rely for their supplies. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs proved helpful in the latter case, and the prohibition was removed. In common with all consular officers resident in Iran, the Residency staff continued to suffer much inconvenience from the innumerable import restrictions. This inconvenience could, unfortunately, only be partially mitigated by the efforts of His Majesty’s Legation.19 Iranian Jurisdiction over the Outer Anchorage at Bushire. 69. At the end of 1936 a German member of the crew of the Hansa Line vessel Geierfels was prosecuted by two coolies for an assault said to have been ^ committed on the ship while she was lying at the outer anchorage at Bushire. The outer anchorage lies some 7 miles from the shore, and therefore outside the limit of territorial waters as recognised by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. The German Legation decided that the sailor, who had left Bushire with his ship for Bandar Shahpur, must be surrendered to the Iranian authorities, and he was brought back to Bushire for trial. A precedent was thus created for the exercise by the Iranian authorities of criminal jurisdiction over ships at the outer anchorage, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf requested instructions regarding the action which he should take if a similar case arose involving a British subject or British-protected person. The point was referred to the Foreign Office, who replied that for practical reasons it seemed desirable to recognise Iranian jurisdiction over the outer anchorage at Bushire. The attitude of His Majesty’s Government with regard to the limit of territorial waters could be safeguarded by informing the Iranian Government officially that His Majesty’s Government had decided unilaterally to recognise this jurisdiction in view of the special circumstances obtaining at Bushire, but no such communi cation need be made until a concrete case had arisen. His Majesty’s Minister informed the Political Resident that, subject to the latter’s views (not received before the year closed), he agreed that this was the best course to adopt. Conditions at the Gulf Ports. 70. Great inconvenience was caused to British shipping companies by the chaotic conditions prevailing during the year at the ports of Khorramshahr, Bandar Shahpur and Bushire. The inefficiency of the Customs and the lack of landing arrangements equal to coping with the huge cases of machinery and the girders and other material required for the railway and for the industrialisa tion of the country had long caused serious congestion in the Customs at the three ports. This congestion was greatly intensified in the early part of 1937, partly because goods could not be withdrawn from the Customs for lack of foreign exchange permits, but mainly owing to the inexperienced management of the new monopoly companies, which ordered their requirements for an entire year to arrive all at once instead of spread over the year. The confusion was particularly bad at Khorramshahr, where incoming cargo was piled in every available space all over the town. One especially serious consequence of the congestion was an intensification of the rise in transport costs throughout the country because urgently-needed lorries, tyres and accessories could not be cleared from the Customs. For lack of storage space, cargo could not be unloaded from lighters, and one consignment of motor cars remained so long on a barge that it eventually sank. Lack of barges caused serious delays to steamers, and much cargo was overcarried to Basra. His Majesty s Legation were instructed by the Foreign Office to consider whether representations regarding the conditions at the various ports could usefully be made to the Iranian Government. But, since the Iranian Government were the chief sufferers from the congestion and were greatly embarrassed by it and doing what they could to remedy it, it was decided that nothing would be gained by such representations. As so often, the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company came to the assistance of the local authorities in Khuzistan, lending a crane and storage space in their compound at Khorramshahr, and unloading and assembling a considerable number of motor lorries at Abadan. 71. The lack of barges at Khorramshahr available for working steamers made it necessary for the British steamship agents, who had for many years held the greater part of the business of landing cargo at that port, to hire barges fiom Basra at considerable cost. Landing charges thus rose steeply. The situation thus created, by enabling him to represent that the foreign agents’ charges were excessive, gave Colonel Bayendor an opportunity to carry through a scheme, which he had been hatching for some time, for the formation of an Iranian company with the monopoly of landing cargo at Khorramshahr. The company, the Sherkat-i-Kashtirani Karun, was formed in February, being mainly controlled by a rich Khorramshahr merchant named Novaghar. On the 30th March Colonel Bayendor issued an order stating that the company had the sole right of [16966] D * 220 transporting cargo from ship to shore at Khorramshahr. The British s upping agents, Gray, Mackenzie and Co. (one of the firms into which the Mesopo amia- Iran Corporation was dissolved during the year), Strick and Co. ana ncJ *} and Eastern (Limited), were thus deprived of a business which had piove remunerative in the past. His Majesty’s Minister caused the shipping agen s fe. to be informed that he was prepared to take the matter up with the Iranian Government if they so desired. But the agents decided that it was useless .o contest the grant of the monopoly to the Iranian company, and concentrated on making the new arrangements work without detriment to their pi me ipals. Difficulties at once arose over the question of responsibility for cargo from ship s side to the Customs, a point which had been completely overlooked by the naval authorities, who were entirely ignorant of the technicalities of the shipping industry. The Customs at first refused to recognise receipts given by the monopoly company, and continued to hold the shipping companies responsible for the delivery of cargo to the Customs, although the shipping companies and their agents had no longer any control of the cargo since it left the ship s side. The monopoly company also at first denied any responsibility for cargo in its lighters. Eventually, after a great deal of correspondence, an agreement was reached between the Customs and the monopoly company, by which the Customs accepted the receipts given by the company at the ship’s side as a valid discharge of the ship’s responsibility, while the company accepted responsibility for cargo in its charge. This arrangement proved satisfactory to the shipping agents, and by the end of May His Majesty’s vice-consul at Khorramshahr could report that, contrary to all expectation, the monopoly company was proving a success, and that, thanks to the co-operation of the Customs, the delays in landing cargo had been greatly reduced. This progress was maintained throughout the summer, and by the end of September the position of the Customs at Khorramshahr had improved appreciably. The success of the monopoly company was attributed mainly to the fact that it had the blessing of the naval, port and Customs authorities, and was therefore free of the innumerable petty difficulties created for the foreign shipping agents. 72. Up till the end of the year the Sherkat-i-Kashtirani, Karun, had not obtained any monopoly of the transport of goods on the Karun from Khorramshahr to Ahwaz, though its managing director was very anxious to exclude from this trade the Iran Transport Company, a British company which has carried on river transport on the Karun for upwards of fifty years. Threats to the right of this company to operate its service on the Karun, which depends on a Persian declaration of 1888, opening the Karun to vessels of all nations, had already appeared in 1936, but by the end of 1937 they had still not materialised, and Gray, Mackenzie and Co., as agents for the Iran Transport Company, were still carrying a good deal of cargo on the Karun, mainly for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. They were, however, due, like the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, to comply by the end of the year with a regulation of the naval authorities, requiring that the overall width of a tug with its barge, towed alongside, should not exceed 14 metres. Previously, river steamers had towed two barges alongside with an overall width of as much as 26 metres. The new regulation seemed likely to increase the cost of river transport on the Karun appreciably. 73. Rumours were current throughout the year that the Iranian Government intended to take active steps to divert trade from Khorramshahr and the Karun to Bandar Shahpur and the railway, and that to this end the Customs at Ahwaz would be closed, and shipping of cargo under through bills of lading to Ahwaz stopped. It is probable that the ultimate aim of the Iranian Government is to concentrate all international trade at Bandar Shahpur. But the Government are clearly aware that Bandar Shahpur is still hopelessly inadequate to cope with all Iran’s sea-borne trade, and there were no indications during the year that it was intended to divert trade from the Karun in the near future. ' On the contrary, it was reported at the end of the year that contracts had been given for the construction of new wharves at Khorramshahr and of a new customs house at Ahwaz with a wharf on the Karun. Conditions at Bandar Shahpur remained extremely bad throughout the year. Ships using the port suffered great delay, and the Strick and Hansa lines decided at one time on a partial boycott of the port. The Hansa line appeared to regret their decision to concentrate on this port, and it was reported that there was much friction between them and the[16966] d* 3 21 Iranian Government. The ambitious schemes for the development of the port appeared to have been abandoned for the time being, but a contract was reported to have been given in September to a Swiss firm for the lengthening and strengthening of the existing jetty to provide a second berth. More locomotives and rolling-stock were also to be provided to relieve the congestion, but at the end of the year there had been no improvement. Charbar. 74. With the acceptance in March 1936 of the petition of Haji Abdul Hussein Hyderabadi, the leader of the Khoja community at Charbar, for the renunciation of his Iranian nationality, it appeared that the Khoja question had been finally settled. The petitions of the majority of the Khojas having been accepted in July 1935, they should, according to Iranian law, have left Iran in July 1936, but it was not till January 1937 that they actually departed. On the 26th January, 282 members of the community left Charbar by steamer. The majority went to Muscat, but a few went to Gwadur. 75. Haji Abdul Hussein and his sons did not leave with the others. In March the Governor-General of Mekran visited Charbar, and Haji Abdul Hussein, as the leading merchant of the place, played an active part in the celebrations held there on the occasion of the opening of the new motor road from Zahidan. The Governor-General took him to Zahidan, and Haji Abdul Hussein sub sequently accepted a contract for the supply of provisions to the Charbar garrison. In September a letter was received from him showing that he had every intention of remaining there with his sons, and His Majesty’s consul at Kerman reported that he was also arranging for the return of other Khojas from Muscat. It was decided that if he could obtain formal permission to remain, His Majesty’s Legation had no reason to object or to refuse him protection, but that in the absence of formal permission it would not be possible to help him in any trouble arising directly out of his failure to comply with the law and leave Iran. 76. Throughout the year a large number of letters and petitions were received from the Khoja community, requesting assistance in the custody or sale of their immovable property at Charbar, in the recovery of debts, and in arranging permission for the export of their cash and their gold and silver ornaments, which they were obliged to leave behind, the export of gold and silver being prohibited. Nothing could be done to help them in the recovery of their debts or the sale of their property. But they were informed that, if they sold their gold and silver and submitted a comprehensive statement of the sums which they wished to transfer, the Exchange Control Commission would be asked to grant the necessary foreign exchange. No statement of the Khojas’ requirements was received, and no approach was made to the commission. Manumission. 77. In January an Iranian woman, who said she was the slave of an Iranian master, applied to the Political Resident at Bushire for manumission. Since slavery is forbidden in Iran under the law of 1929, she was informed that she should apply for assistance to the Governor of Bushire. (c) East Iran. General. 78. Anglo-Iranian relations in East Iran may conveniently be considered under two headings : Incidents and the Boycott of His Majesty’s Consular Establishments. 79. In 1937 there were no serious incidents on the scale of the commandeering of lorries in 1934 and 1935, nor the episode of Gorich Kalag. There were a few minor ones, mainly in the form of extortion and obstruction and even maltreatment of lorry drivers, travellers and pilgrims on the part of passport, customs and police officials, but these must unfortunately be regarded as inevitable as long as the cost of living is so high and the pay of officials so low. Generally speaking, the Governor-General at Meshed, while making it clear that he had little control over the police, was always ready to listen to and take up any concrete case put to him by His Majesty’s consulate-general, and it is satisfactory that on more than one occasion a notoriously corrupt official was made to disappear■—I 22 from the scene. One case may be mentioned here as being a blend of incident and boycott. In August the Iranian chauffeur of a British Indian tradesman at Meshed had his licence confiscated on a trumped-up charge by the police, and he was further informed that he must leave the employ of his British Indian master. The case was taken up by His Majesty’s consul-general and by His Majesty’s Legation, with special reference to the last feature. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs took the line that a police prosecution of an Iranian subject was no concern of the British authorities. 80. Developments as regards the boycott of British consular officers were a much more unsatisfactory feature of the year. By 1937 a new consul-general, Mr. G. F. Squire of the Indian Civil Service, had replaced Colonel Daly, Major Hamber had left and the equivocal post held by him had been definitely terminated. The Iranian authorities had been told that His Majesty’s Govern ment in the United Kingdom and the Government of India hoped that 1937 would inaugurate improved relationships with British officials in East Iran. Mr. Squire, in his dealings with the Governor-General and other local officials, made every effort to implement this hope; M. Pakrevan personally seemed disposed to make some cautious response, and even promised a real improvement in the situation. The Secret Police, however, were entirely unresponsive, and too strong for M. Pakrevan. The imprisonment of Iranians who had ventured to play football with the consular staff at Zabul, the spying upon the vice-consul at Birjand and interference with any who had contact with him, and the virtual refusal of medical help to the small son of an Indian clerk in charge of the vice-consulate, were paralleled by similar and all too familiar action at Meshed. There the spying on the consulate-general personnel and the intimidation of their visitors was, if anything, increased, and it was made virtually impossible for Iranian tradesmen, except with police permission, to visit the consulate premises. In September Mr. Squire reported that a villager of modest means from whom he, with M. Pakrevan’s knowledge and full approval, had rented a camping ground during the hot weather, had been arrested and charged with having dealings with the British consul-general, and four leading men of the village had experienced the same fate. Mr. Squire was able to secure the release of his lessor with the familiar explanation that he had been arrested on an entirely different charge. 81. There was also increased persecution of persons who had worked in the past for members of the consulate-general. It is satisfactory to record that the joint efforts of the consulate-general and His Majesty’s Legation were successful in securing that the most worthy of these, Jabbar Agha, a Turcoman, was released from prison and allowed with another non-Iranian ex-employee of the consulate to migrate to Indian territory, but there were Iranian subjects whom it was found impossible or very difficult to assist. 82. The worst case was that of the arrest and imprisonment of Mirza Mohamed Khan Vakili, son of Haji Mirza Abbas Khan, C.M.G., C.I.E., formerly British agent at Meshed, who draws a British pension of 250 rials per mensem. Mirza Mohamed himself was dismissed from British service some years ago and came to the consulate only to draw his pension. He was arrested on the 3rd October on leaving the consulate; his house was searched and every document written in English seized, as well as the decorations granted to his father. He was placed in solitary confinement and charged with being a British spy. Nothing incriminating was found, and after thirty-five days’ solitary confinement he was released; but on returning to his post at the Finance Department at Meshed he was told that he could no longer be employed because he had been in prison. Subsequently he seems to have secured permission from the police to visit the consulate-general to draw his pension. 83. As a result of this accumulated vindictiveness, His Majesty’s consul- general felt that the Governor-General had for the time exhausted his ability to help him against the malevolence of the police, and that his own local efforts required support at Tehran. His Majesty’s Minister saw the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the latter’s return from Europe, recounted to him several of the recent unsatisfactory incidents and urged that, even if the Iranian Government still thought it impossible to allow their citizens to frequent foreign consulates freely, it must surely be possible to arrange that matters should not be carried to suchridiculous lengths as was still the case. His Majesty’s Minister referred specially, but not exclusively, to the situation at Meshed, expressing particular disappoint ment that, although the post had been reorganised to avoid the suspicions (though unwarranted) felt by the Iranian authorities in the past, the consulate-general was still treated as before. This was, incidentally, extremely bad propaganda for Iran, for what must be the feelings with which the unfortunate officials left Iran, whose fate had been to live in the provinces. M. Samiy realised and regretted the position, but he thought it an inevitable consequence of past history and of the spirit of nationalism which was raging everywhere. The treatment of foreign consulates resulted largely from the behaviour of the Russians, and the necessities that undue foreign influence should not recur, and that the representatives of all countries should be treated alike. On His Majesty’s Minister repeating his conviction that senior police officials were pushing things much further than the Government would wish, M. Samiy seemed to assent and promised to speak to the Prime Minister. Subsequently M. Samiy was sent notes of the various cases of which His Majesty’s Minister had had to make complaint. It is satisfactory to record that, towards the end of the year, Sarhung Nawai, chief of police at Meshed, was recalled to Tehran. This may augur some improvement. It was satisfactory, too, that a burglarious attempt on the house, and even bedroom, of the British vice-consul at Zahidan by a disreputable soldier, after being frustrated by Major Campbell’s presence of mind and energy, was severely punished by the local military authorities. At Zahidan, indeed, where the Governor-General of Mekran, Taj Baksh, was personally friendly, the lot of His Majesty’s British Indian subjects was not too bad. The competition threatened by the Government- owned East Iran Transport Company with the Indian lorry drivers did not materialise; there was even a prospect that the victims of the lorries commandeered in December 1935, would extract locally something nearer a fair repayment than seemed likely early in the year, and the universal smuggling, in which army and Amnieh and all participated, gave the Indian colony a means of livelihood and a zest in life. Baluchistan Frontier Questions. 84. No reference was made in 1937 to the measures which the Government of India had offered to take to assist the Iranian authorities. Throughout the year the Iranian Ministry for Foreign Affairs transmitted the usual complaints against British Baluchis of murder, brigandage, thefts of camels and donkeys and attempted seduction of Iranian tribesmen. There was also an obscure and ill-founded complaint as to the cutting of telegraph wires in Iranian territory near Mirjawa, and an appeal that the Indian authorities would accept an Iranian Baluchi named Abdul Karim who had previously given trouble in British Baluchistan and was presently in prison in Zahidan. On neither of these last points was it possible to give satisfaction to the Iranian Government, and a request for the extradition of three Iranian soldiers had to be met with a reminder of the attitude of the Government of India in this connexion. For the rest, the complaints were transmitted to the Government of India in cases where reasonable particulars had been furnished. The Government of India had their counter-complaints against Iranian Baluchis. 85. Early in the year His Majesty’s Minister told the then head of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the only hopes of settling such matters was on the spot by the local officials. M. Soheily replied that the Ministry of War could not agree to this procedure. The unconvincing reason given was that there were no local Iranian officials who could properly treat these matters with British consular officers. None the less, it was impressed on the Ministry on the occasion of every complaint transmitted by them that only through local co-operation could effective action be taken. Visits by Non-Moslem British Subjects to the Shrine at Meshed. 86. Though the Iranian authorities continued to encourage visits, always under escort, by Christians to the Shrine, it remained British policy that non- Moslem British subjects should not seek nor avail themselves of facilities for visiting it. Thus the party of British, Australian and American students of the National Union of Students, who toured Iran in 1937, with the good offices of His Majesty’s Legation and consular posts, abstained from repeating the [16966J d* 4previous year’s visit to the Shrine, and, of course, no British officials enteied it. When the acting counsellor to His Majesty’s Legation in Tehran ca ed on the Governor-General at Meshed in November, M. Pakrevan offered him all aci i ics for visiting the Shrine, saying that a visit was perfectly simple. Mr. Butiei nu to plead an already filled programme. 87. Doubts were raised during the year whether the policy of abstention was still necessary in view of the increasing number of Christian visitois, including resident diplomats, who entered the enclosure. It was telt however that the existing policy might wisely be adhered to a little longer, and the head of the American hospital at Meshed told Mr. Butler that, as far as residents m Meshed were concerned, and doctors in particular, he was definitely ot t ic opinion that it was wiser not to enter. Moreover, it appears that local opinion has not yet realised the Iranian Government’s new policy, for various Bi itish Moslem subjects spoke to His Majesty’s consul-general in the firm and appiovmg belief that no Christians set foot in the hallowed enclosure. Zahidan Railway. 88. At the end of the year the Government of India still had under consideration the possibility of effecting economy by withdrawing rail-head from Nok Kundi to Dalbandin without unduly disturbing arrangements for supplying the Chagai levies, and, it was hoped, without injuring seriously the diminished Indo-Iranian trade served by the railway. 89. During the year the Iranian Government did not raise the question of reopening the railway to Zahidan, but in November the Governor-General of Khorassan told the acting counsellor to His Majesty’s Legation that the decision in principle had been taken by the Iranian Government to build eventually a branch line from Meshed to the Trans-Iranian Railway; M. Pakrevan hoped that the Government of India would reopen their service to Zahidan and that India would before very long be linked by rail to Europe. It would, in particular, help him in Khorassan to hold his own commercially against Soviet Russia if the exports of East Iran possessed an easier and alternative outlet through India. It was pointed out to M. Pakrevan that the present Iianian commercial and exchange policies did not contribute to the development of Indo-Iranian trade. 90. The negotiations for an Indo-Iranian Commercial Agreement, which seemed imminent in 1936, having fallen through owing to the attitude of the Iranian Government, the value of the railway as a bargaining counter receded, though it did not disappear, and His Majesty’s Legation confined themselves to asking that, if the Government of India should decide to withdraw rail-head to Nok Kundi, the Iranian Government should be given ample notice of what would be to them a seriously disappointing decision. Consulate Doctors. 91. In 1937 the Iranian authorities continued their offensive against doctors attached to British consulates. At the end of 1936 His Majesty’s Legation were endeavouring to secure that the doctor attached to His Majesty’s consulate-general at Meshed should be given an unrestricted licence to practise there as well as such facilities as could be agreed to when he visited Birjand, Zabul and Zahidan. Early in the year the head of the Third Political Depart ment assured His Majesty’s Legation that he understood the point about a doctor requiring adequate practice, and that the doctor at Meshed would be allowed to practise unrestrictedly there, but at the other posts to treat only the consular staffs. The Government of India agreed to these terms, and Dr. O’Connor assumed charge as medical officer in Khorassan on the 20th February. 92. Unfortunately, in April the Ministry for Foreign Affairs went back on this arrangement, explaining, with apologies, that the medical officer’s practice must at Meshed, as elsewhere, be confined to consulate staffs; this decision was based mainly on the undesirability of permitting a system which would have to be extended to the Soviet consulate-general. In July it was further explained orally that the Iranian Government did not wish to give locus standi to foreigners where they could avoid it in frontier areas, which appeared to include Meshed as well as Zabul. His Majesty’s Legation, in spite of prolonged efforts,[16966] E * ■sm 2 '' . 25 found it impossible to move the Iranian authorities from this position, or to induce them to sanction the agreed arrangement, without prejudice to the future, during the tenure of his post by the new doctor, who had come to Meshed on that understanding. In August a note was received stating that the Iranian -Jt' Government could not grant Captain O’Connor a medical licence because they had taken a general decision that no licences should in future be granted to doctors attached to foreign consulates. Further reference to this decision is made in paragraph 140 below. 93. In June His Majesty’s consul-general at Meshed reported that Dr. O’Connor was giving his services regularly at the American Mission Hospital, and that the head of it, Dr. Hoffman, took the view that it was unnecessary for Dr. O’Connor to possess any licence for the purpose of assisting him in the hospital. Dr. O’Connor stated that this arrangement gave him f enough work to keep his hand in. It was considered judicious to inform the head of the Third Political Department of it orally; M. Ansarie made no adverse comment, but later, when Dr. O’Connor learned that his application for a licence, made before he was aware of the Iranians going back on their assurance, had been refused, he felt that it would be unwise to continue practising gratis at the American hospital until the Iranian authorities had given formal sanction. 94. The United States Charg6 d’Affaires was consulted as to the expediency of seeking this, and he, though perfectly agreeable to Dr. O’Connor continuing to give his services unless and until some protest was made, thought that the view of Dr. Hoffmann should again be taken before formal sanction was sought. The acting counsellor to His Majesty’s Legation discussed the matter with Dr. Hoffman in November and found him reluctant to commit himself; nor had he done so before the year ended. Dr. Hoffman had, however, elicited by private enquiry that the objection made by the Iranian authorities to Dr. O’Connor practising unrestrictedly was essentially political, and a part of the policy of preventing Iranians from having dealings with foreigners in official positions. Dr. O’Connor was due to leave Meshed permanently in February 1938, and it was understood that the Government of India intend to replace him. 95. In the course of discussion, His Majesty’s consul-general at Meshed raised the question of the position of the British hospital at Zabul, and suggested that it might be desirable to forestall Iranian objection to the hospital continuing to function by pointing out to the Iranian Government that its utility must be much impaired by the refusal of a licence to Dr. O’Connor to practise in it, and by enquiring whether they would prefer that we should definitely decline to treat any of their nationals in it. The Government of India and His Majesty’s Legation agreed that a communication on the above lines might usefully be made, even at the risk of ending the hospital’s extra-consular staff activities. The matter was discussed orally between the oriental secretary to His Majesty s Legation and the head of the Third Political Department. The latter’s reply was that a distinction could not be made between Iranians and others in the matter of who could be patients of any doctor or hospital. The matter was not taken further. At the close of the year the ordinary inhabitants of Zabul were afraid to visit the hospital, but the Indian sub-assistant surgeon contined to treat f very poor people from the neighbouring villages, and, in addition, a few police and other officials, for venereal disease. Consular Rearrangement. 96. In the course of the year the Government of India raised the question of the rearrangement of consular posts in East Iran, and the suppression or combination of some of them was under consideration up to the end of the year between Delhi, Tehran and Meshed. 97. The vice-consulate at Birjand was the first post to come under fire. Early in 1937 the Government of India enquired of His Majesty’s consul-general at Meshed whether the retention of the vice-consulate was still necessary. The Indian colony there having dwindled almost to vanishing point, His Majesty s Legation and Mr. Squire were in agreement that there was not enough consular work to justify the continuation of a separate post, but also that it would be a mistake to close it down finally and entirely by disposing of the vice-consulate building and the property of Kalateh just outside the town. An arrangement26 on the lines of that at Bandar Abbas was therefore favoured, by which Birjand would for most of the year be left in charge of an Indian clerk. Mr. Squire discussed the matter further in Dehli in December, and it seems probable that the post will be put under the vice-consul at Zabul, who will spend the winter months there and the summer ones at Birjand. Dr. Fazl Haq left Birjand towards the end of the year, and an Indian clerk, having no consular status, was sent from the consulate-general at Meshed to take charge of the vice-consulate. 98. The revised arrangement, if confirmed, and if it is sanctioned by the Iranian Government, will therefore involve the retention of the Zabul vice consulate. The need for this post had also been questioned, but the British Indian colony at Zabul is greater than at Birjand, and the Government of India felt that there were other grounds, such as the uncertain political future, for retaining the post. Zahidan would continue a permanent and whole-time vice consulate. (d) Special Indian Relations. Indian Land Customs Regime. 99. Owing apparently to administrative difficulties, the new limited customs regime could not be imposed, as had been contemplated, with effect from the 1st April on all the land frontiers of India, including the Iranian. His Majesty’s Legation had in the course of the year to inform the Iranian Government of two further postponements; to the second no date was attached, and at the close of the year the rdgime had not come into operation. 100. The Iranian Minister in London enquired of the Foreign Office whether the regime would be applied on India’s Afghan frontier, as his Government had information that it would not. The Foreign Office replied that the regime would apply to all goods of the specified descriptions, from whatever source, that were imported across any of the land frontiers of India, including the Afghan frontier, and that the rates of customs duty leviable would be those at present levied at the sea ports in India. Appointment of Iranian Vice-Consul at Q,uetta. 101. The Government of India and His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom agreed that no adequate reason existed for refusing to accept an Iranian vice-consul at Quetta, and His Majesty’s Legation were informed by the Foreign Office in the autumn that they were about to inform the Iranian Minister in London, in an official note, of the decision to allow a vice-consulate to be set up, and at the same time to impress upon him orally the exceptional nature of the concession. Previously, consideration had been given to the possibility of extracting some bargaining power from this decision, but doubts were felt as to this being practicable. 102. It was, however, unsatisfactory that during the year there were many complaints of the conduct of this new official. First, he usurped this title while he was, in fact, only a passport-issuing officer; secondly, he adopted a tiresome practice of doubtful legality of endorsing the passports of British Indian traders wishful of returning to Iran, to the effect that they must possess and produce at the frontier sums varying from 300 to 1,000 rupees. Ostensibly, this was to prevent persons incapable of supporting themselves from entering Iran; actually, it seemed to be a dodge for securing little driblets of foreign exchange, for the holder was obliged to sell his rupees to the bank as soon as he had entered the country. When His Majesty’s Legation protested that insistence on the possession of foreign exchange was an innovation not provided for in the Iranian regulations, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs pointed out that Iranian law forbade the import of any sum greater than 200 rials in Iranian currencv. 103. Thirdly,^ this official insisted, contrary to British Indian practice, on ladies adhering to purdah producing photographs for their passports. Late in the year a protest on this point also was made by His Majesty’s Legation. Finally, he gave furthei offence by compelling a British Indian resident at Zahidan, desirous of returning there, to accept an endorsement obliging him to return from Iran within a period of one month.[16966] e* 2 27 104. There was reason to believe that some of the above annoyances were due to the passport-issuing officer’s clerk, who suffered from an itching palm, rather than to the former personally. A rticles in Indian Newspapers. 105. At the close of 1936 the Government of India informed the Iranian consul-general in New Delhi that they considered it inexpedient to prosecute the editor of the Rozana Hind for having published an article of which M. Nourzad had complained, seeing that such prosecution would give wider publicity to an article that had appeared nearly nine months ago and had probably long been forgotten. Nor did they think that forfeiting any remaining copies of the issue in question would serve any useful purpose. The Bengal Government had, however, been asked to warn the editor of the paper against publishing similar articles in the future. M. Nourzad replied with a lament that the Govern ment of India had been dilatory—a suggestion which the Government of India were able to rebut—and seemed to fear that he could not count upon their co-operation should any similar case occur. 106. There was no fresh case until the end of the year when the new head of the Third Political Department made an oral complaint about an offensive article entitled: “A Persian Miniature,” written by an unidentified traveller from Iraq through Iran to India, which was published in the Civil and Military Gazette of Lahore, a British-owned newspaper. M. Zanjani said that it was the settled policy of the Iranian Government to follow up any publications that they regarded as insulting to Iran, and asked that his complaint might be passed on to the Government of India; he hoped that under official pressure the news paper would make some amends by publishing some article more favourable to Iran. The article in question being inaccurate and offensive, His Majesty’s Minister wrote to the Government of India transmitting and supporting M. Zanjani’s request. (e) Miscellaneous. Imperial Bank of Iran. 107. The numerous anxieties that the year brought to the Imperial Bank did not penetrate to the roots of business, and 1937 was a successful year. The foundations were the arrangements made in the spring of 1936 when the bank was given authority to conduct operations involving foreign exchange in return for opening a credit of £300,000, in favour of the Government, to support the exchange and a further £300,000, later increased to £600,000, to finance the operations of companies with a preponderant Government holding. These arrangements were left undisturbed in 1937 and they enabled the bank to make a comfortable profit. They were buttressed by the bank’s good reputation, Mr. Walter, in particular, holding a quite exceptional position in Isfahan, and no doubt also by the fact that the bank was a distressed Government’s most direct access to the potentialities of the London market. This last consideration may account for the Iranian Government reducing their indebtedness to the bank during the year from a maximum of about £1,100,000 to a figure under £300,000. 108. In April the bank found it necessary to raise their discount rate and rate of interest on advances to 10 per cent. In August, its rival, the National Bank of Iran, which in the first half of the year gave very little credit, reduced its rates considerably below these. The Imperial Bank held to them, and it is a tribute to its position that it seems to have suffered no appreciable loss of business. 109. Anxieties and difficulties were, however, manifold. In February M. Davar, the able and courageous Minister of Finance, whom the bank had always found frank, terse and definite, committed suicide under the strain of overwork grappling with difficulties in no small measure the result of his own policies. For many months after his death no Finance Minister was appointed. Throughout the year there was no one at the Ministry whom the bank felt had any real grasp of a confused and deteriorating situation, no one to whom it could put questions with the expectation of prompt and genuine replies, and still less anyone who added to understanding a courage equal to presenting to the Shah the realities of the situation.28 110. The president of the Exchange Control Commission, who had at least been a faithful watchdog of the commission’s resources, left Iran in June, leaving a man of inferior calibre in control, and did not return. Ihese and black bouises inside and outside the country were some of the factors that added to the existing complications. 111. In these circumstances the help that the bank was anxious to give to a Government woefully short of foreign exchange, and to harassed traders, had to be tempered with a large dose of caution. It may be assumed that the Ministry of Finance chafed a little under the bank’s caution, and relations between the two institutions were probably less cordial and certainly less close than in 1936, but no major difficulty arose, and there was nothing remotely resembling a breach between them. 112. As regards the National Bank of Iran, early in the year, at a time when the National Bank was rigidly restricting credits, the director, General Khosrovi, volunteered the suggestion that the Imperial Bank should finance some of the operations of the monopoly and Government-controlled companies, which had hitherto been the National Bank’s province, and in the spring the Imperial Bank obliged the National Bank with a six-figure credit; but in Tehran and in the provinces it was clear that the National Bank was pressing its competition, and by methods neither very clever nor very scrupulous. At the end of the year the Tehran manager of the Imperial Bank had to make a protest in writing against misrepresentation in the National Bank’s official bulletin of the Imperial Bank’s discount rates in Khuzistan. Such efforts to influence Iranians against the Imperial Bank were no new feature, but some accentuation of them in 1937 may be explained by the nationalism pursued during the year in all official quarters. 113. The Imperial Bank was inconvenienced by two manifestations of this spirit in connexion with the Iranian Government’s measure to substitute Persian and Arabic letters for European languages. It met the first demand, early in the year, by covering the bank’s name above the portal of their fine modern premises with a broad blue cloth. The subsequent requirement, that the bank, in common with all other companies and commercial institutions, should keep its accounts and conduct its correspondence in Persian was more serious. The bank’s London board took the view that the accountancy difficulties that must arise from this might make it difficult for the bank to continue operations, and they suggested that the Tehran manager, supported by His Majesty’s Legation, should make a protest. No legal grounds for this, however, were forthcoming, and the utility of a protest was doubted. The Tehran manager, who took a less pessimistic view, preferred to proceed by oral negotiation with the Minister of Justice, and by the end of the year was hopeful that he had secured a reasonable and not unsatis factory compromise by which the only books that would need to be kept in Persian were the four that the bank might be required to produce in a Court of Justice. Anglo-Iranian Oil Company {Limited). 114. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company had a busy year of continued expansion. The considerable increase in their exports introduced a new complica tion into the frontier negotiations between Iran and Iraq, as described in paragraph 159 below. The company were anxious to build new jetties at Qusbeh below Abadan, to be fed by a pipe-line from the Abadan refinery. The Shah’s consent to this scheme was for some time withheld, doubtless because he feared that it would reproduce the anomalous position at Abadan which the new frontier settlement was to remedy, but later he gave his approval. The company began their preparations at Qusbeh and started buying out the owners of date groves, only to discover that the proposed site was after all unsuitable. Another site nearer Abadan was subsequently chosen for the new jetties. 115. At the same time the company’s expansion gave rise to problems more fundamental than the provision of additional loading facilities for Abadan. Production of oil has risen to such a point that it has become doubtful whether the single refinery at Abadan, with its enormous requirements for water, steam,[16966J E * 3 29 electricity, housing of labour, &amp;c., can economically be further expanded. The problem is complicated by the entry into production of the promising new Gach Qaraguli field. The country between this field and Abadan is so marshy that it is unsuitable for a pipe-line, so that a pipe-line to Abadan would have to make a long and expensive detour. The company have therefore considered the construc tion of a second refinery, probably in the neighbourhood of Bandar Shahpur. Here there is a favourable waterway, but the land surrounding it is most unsuitable, being waterlogged and at the same time without fresh water supplies, so that the construction of a new refinery and its attendant town would involve serious engineering problems. At the end of 1937 a survey party was sent to the area. Developments in this area will be of great interest. 116. The company’s activity in the expanding internal market continued to increase, and the refinery at Kermanshah worked to capacity throughout the year. In January and February exceptionally severe weather almost caused a serious shortage of petrol and oil in Tehran and Northern Iran. For many weeks the passes between Kermanshah and Tehran were blocked for days at a time, while lack of transport due to the requirements of the army authorities, who were bringing up war material from Bandar Shahpur, delayed the arrival of supplies from Abadan. The disorganisation of the transport industry forced the company reluctantly to embark on a very large expansion of their own fleet of tanker lorries. New tankers arrived in large numbers at the end of the year, and, aided by the mild weather, the company were able to accumulate sufficiently large stocks in Northern Iran to avert any danger of another shortage, even with the greatly increased demands for bulk supplies for industrial purposes. At the same time the company proceeded with plans to meet the new situation when the railway would be ready. Depots were constructed on the railway at Salehabad, Azna and Firuzkuh, from which large areas would be supplied, the Kermanshah refinery remaining primarily to supply North-Western Iran. 117. The company’s relations with the Iranian authorities during the year were markedly good. Early in the year Colonel Bayendor caused them some inconvenience and expense over conscription arrangements and other minor matters such as the construction of a new jetty at Khorramshahr, and he was also believed to be obstructing the plans for new developments at Qusbeh. But after the Shah’s visit to Khuzistan his attitude improved considerably. There was in fact reason to believe that special instructions were sent from Tehran to the local authorities at Khuzistan to help the company in every way. In particular, the local authorities were helpful in repressing several minor strikes which occurred during the year on the pipe-line and in the refinery. In fact, the company were forced to intervene on behalf of the ringleaders of a strike in the refinery, who were very roughly handled by the police. The labour troubles which occurred during the year were not serious, but the possibility of such trouble on a large scale caused the company some anxiety, and may prove a serious problem in the future. 118. These good relations with the Government were doubtless due in part to the ready assistance given by the company whenever it was needed by the Iranian authorities. The most notable request for help which they received arose out of a serious shortage of grain in Khorassan at the beginning of the year. Owing to transport difficulties the Iranian Government decided that they must import wheat via Quetta and Zahidan, and they therefore asked the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company to arrange urgently for the purchase of 400 tons of wheat in India. Preliminary arrangements were made by the company, while the Government of India agreed to give special visa facilities to Iranian lorry drivers on the Zahidan-Nok-Kundi road. But after a few days the Ministry of Finance stated that the wheat was no longer required. In Khuzistan the company were able to give the local authorities much-needed assistance in the preparations for the Shah’s visit, while they also helped to deal with the congestion in the Khorramshahr Customs described in paragraph 67 above. 119. The company’s good relations with the Iranian Government were also due in part to the excellent position enjoyed by their able Tehran representative. The credit for the decision to allow the construction of new jetties below Abadan must probably be given to Mr. Rice. Another notable achievement at the end ofthe year was the concession obtained from the Iranian Government exempting the company from the regulations of the 7th July, 1937, which I'equired that .all business firms should keep their accounts and correspondence m * ' • The company were able to obtain a statement in writing that ie) \ c P , to conduct ill their correspondence in English. It can also be said that the growing financial difficulties of the Government contributed to strengthen the company’s position. 120 A minor event of interest was the purchase by the Iranian Government of all the shares held by the Bakhtiari Khans in the First Exploitation Company and the Bakhtiari Oil Company, which gave birth to the Anglo-Iraman Oil Company. 37,320 shares were taken over at a purchase price of a little undei £350,000, which was thought to be reasonable. Thus disappeared the last tiace of the traditional connexion between the company and the Bakiitiari ixnans. 121. Neither the grant by the Iranian Government early in the year oi concessions in North-East and East Iran to two American oil companies, nor the terms of the concessions were regarded in Tehran as a serious blow either ^o the position or interests of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and an article m the concession of the company due to construct pipe-lines specihed that these must no, infringe existing rights as regards the transport of oil. British Insurance Companies. 122. The year was an anxious one for the British insurance companies operating in Iran, the majority of which were represented in Tehran by Messrs. Fowler and Co. In October 1936 the Council of Ministers approved a decree regu lating the position of all insurance companies operating in Iran, which involved onerous provisions affecting foreign insurance companies, such as the deposit ot a o-uarantee of 1 million rials and the retention in Iran of 50 per cent ot net premiums. Theobject of the decree was doubtless primarily to strengthen the newly formed Iran Assurance Company. Insurance companies were given a period of six months within which they had to comply with the decree or withdraw from Iran. The exact meaning of many of the provisions of the decree was far from clear, and at the end of 1936 a questionnaire was addressed to the Ministry for horeign Affairs by the companies’ agents in an attempt to clarify the position. By the middle of February 1937 no reply had been received. On the 16th February His Majesty’s Minister explained the position to the head of the European Depait- ment at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, pointing out that the period of grace would soon run out, while the insurance companies still lacked the information on which they could base a decision whether or not to remain in Iran. He therefore asked that the period of grace should be extended by three months. This was granted, and later a further extension to the 2nd October was also given. 123. During the summer Mr. de Courcy, a director of Messrs. Fowler and Co., spent several months in Tehran endeavouring to obtain better conditions for the foreign companies, but without much success. He was assured that the Iranian Government had no desire to drive out foreign insurance companies. But it was significant that during the summer the Department of Commerce issued a circular to all Chambers of Commerce in Iran urging their members to insure only with the Iran Assurance Company. On the 18th October the Council of Ministers approved a new decree, cancelling that of a year before, but repeating its provisions in the main, with the addition of a new and important article requiring that all insurance companies operating in Iran must reinsure 25 per cent, of their business with the Iran Assurance Company. Insurance companies were allowed three months within which to comply with the decree. By the end of the year the views and intentions of the British companies had not yet been communicated to His Majesty’s Legation. The situation was to some extent complicated by the special position of the Royal Assurance Company, which handled all the business of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. This business was of such value that the Royal Assurance Company were prepared to comply with the new legislation in order to retain it. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company were also anxious not to appear reluctant to deal with the Iran Assurance Company. Mr. Corbett Wright, the Bombay representative of the Royal Assurance Company, who had spent several months in Tehran earlier in the year, returned in DecemberT16966 ] e* 4 31 to attempt to reach some satisfactory solution. But it was difficult for his com pany to act independently, since they were bound by agreements with the other British companies. The new decree was to come into force on the 16th January, 1938. British Railway Contractors. 124. The British firm, Richard Costain (Limited), and the firm N.M.K., in which Messrs. Nuttall have a 45 per cent, interest, made very good progress during the year with their work on lots 7 and 6 respectively of the southern section of the railway. At the end of the year it was certain that they would be able to hand over well before the contract date in the spring of 1938. But the year was an anxious one for these and the other foreign contractors. The Iranian Government did not press the demand made at the end of 1936 that the foreign companies must deposit foreign currencies, negotiable securities or gold as security for the loans hitherto made to them by the banks in Iran against the guarantee of banks in Europe. But the foreign contractors found themselves in serious difficulties, owing to the change which had taken place in the conditions under which they worked since their contracts were signed. The cost of materials and labour had risen greatly. The new tariff of May 1936 had very much increased the cost of all imports. Transport costs had soared owing to lack of lorries, tyres and spares, due largely to the inexperience of the Iranian monopoly company which con trolled the motor trade. Skilled foreign workmen were being scared away by exchange difficulties. The contractors were thus faced with the prospect of serious losses. 125. In this situation the foreign contractors on lots 5 to 11, and 20 and 21, decided*to make combined representations to the Ministry of Communications for the revision of the terms of their contracts, to compensate them for the increase in their costs, and in particular their labour costs. On the 2nd June Mr. A. G. Bonn, a director of Messrs. Costains, who took the lead in these negotiations, had a long interview with the Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Communications. But the Ministry’s reply was a flat negative. An appeal to the Prime Minister was no more successful. Finally, on the 10th July, the contractors submitted a joint petition to the Shah. It appeared for a time that this had had some effect. ' The Minister of Communications was evidently disturbed, and anxious to break up the contractors’ united front. Some minor concessions were made. In November a commission met on the line to consider the contractors’ claims. But at the end of the year it was clear that their work would be completed before any final answer was given them, so that their most effective weapon, a threat to stop work, would in practice be denied them, and that they would be occupied for many months after their lots are finished in pressing the claims with which they hoped to reduce or wipe out their losses. Offence caused by Books and A rticles 'published in the United Kingdom. 126. The Shah’s extreme sensitiveness to any published criticism in foreign countries led the Iranian Government during the year to make a number of pro tests against books and articles published in the United Kingdom. In May the Minister for Foreign Affairs complained to His Majesty’s Minister of a review of a book on Iran published in The Times Literary Supplement, and of a review in the Observer of Mr. Robert Byron’s Road to Oxiana. In August the Iranian Legation in London protested against a review by Mr. Robert Byron of Sir Aurel Stein’s record of his first two expeditions in Iran, and against one by Mr. Harold Nicolson of a book entitled By Order of the Shah by Miss Sidney Hay and Wing Commander Howard Williams. The latter book, a record of a journey through Iran, caused the most serious storm of the year. Its title and the many references which it contained to the inconvenience suffered by travellers in modern Iran, together with an account of an entirely imaginary interview with the Shah, gave great offence. Protests were made both by the Iranian Legation in London and by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. At the end of October the subject was raised in a debate in the Majlis, which was the signal for an outburst of angry articles in the press. The Iranian Minister in London subsequently asked that the book should be withdrawn, and the publishers eventually agreed to this, subject to the loss involved being reimbursed them. Repeated efforts were made to convince the32 Iranian Government that, much as His Majesty s Government icgie e e publication of anything which might give offence to Iranians, the) weie una e to prevent it, since the English press was free, and the power to censoi ooks le oie publication was either non-existent or extremely restricted. Hut tne ^nan s sensitiveness to criticism made it impossible for the Ministry for Foreign x ans to ignore any criticisms of him or of modern Iran. 127. Fortunately the assistance which was given by the authorities in Palestine and India in checking the display of an Egyptian film objectionable to the Iranian Government (see paragraph 193 of this report) did something to strengthen the hand of His Majesty’s Legation in replying to complaints about offensive publications in general. Murder of Mr. E. A . Fear. 128. The enquiries into the murder of Mr. E. A. hear, a Eritish subject employed as cashier by Messrs. Richard Costain (Limited) on Lot i of t ic Southern Line, who was killed in a hold-up on the 25th April, 1936, eventually ei to the arrest of two men, one of whom was a member of the Amnieh (Roadguards). At the end of July the chief of police stated that these two men were on trial before a military court, and that it was hoped that some part of the sum ot 200,000 rials (£2,500) stolen by the murderers would be recovered. Nothing more was heard until November, when the chief of police said that he uncierstood that at least one of the two accused had been convicted, but that the sentence had not yet been promulgated. He had no information about the stolen money. Fuither enquiries about the result of the trial were made through the Ministry foi 1 oreign Affairs, but no reply had been received by the end of the year. Transference of Iranian Students from France to the United Kingdom. 129. On the 1st March the head of the European Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs called on His Majesty’s Minister and made to him a special and confidential communication to the effect that the Iranian Govern ment had decided to transfer to the United Kingdom a number of Iranian students holding State scholarships who were studying in France. The number of students involved and their courses of study could not yet be stated. Arrangements would be made by the Iranian Committee in Paris which supervised students in Europe and by the Iranian Legation in London, which would com municate with the Foreign Office. The Iranian Government would be grateful for the assistance of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in making the necessary arrangements. They particularly requested that their decision should be treated as confidential and that no publicity should be given to it. 130. The Iranian Government’s decision was doubtless the result of the Shah’s indignation at the articles in the French press, which had led him in January to recall his Minister from Paris. The Iranian Government appear to have found it very difficult to carry out this decision. The Foreign Office were ready to give all possible facilities and encouragement as soon as details were available. But no approach to the Foreign Office was ever made by the Iranian Legation in London, nor did the Ministry for Foreign Affairs refer to the matter again in Tehran. At the end of August an opportunity was taken to ask the Minister of Public Instruction how the transferred students were faring. He replied in some confusion that it had been found that there were many difficulties in the way of moving them from France. The proposal had in fact been dropped. The episode provides an interesting commentary on Iranian administrative methods. Legation Wireless. 131. The British official news was sent to the Agence Pars throughout the year. Fairly extensive use was made of it in the Agence Pars News Service, though towards the end of the year it was noticed that items from the British news were less frequently published, and that the Agence Pars were publishing items which were shown to be incorrect by issues of the British news already in their possession. At the end of the year there were indications that the Iranian Government were about to renew their objection to33 the distribution of news bulletins by foreign missions. The reason probably was that the Soviet Embassy, and perhaps also the Italian Legation, also wished to distribute their own news, and could not be prevented unless all foreign missions were treated similarly. The German Legation were first approached in November, but it was not till the end of December that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs said anything on the subject to His Majesty’s Legation. On the 23rd December the head of the European Department asked the oriental secretary whether His Majesty’s Legation were distributing any copies of the British news outside the Legation, and referred to a circular issued in 1934 notifying foreign missions that the Agence Pars now held the monopoly of the dissemination of foreign news in Iran. Mr. Finch promised to ascertain the exact position. No definite request was made on this occasion that the distribution of the British news should be stopped, but it was evident that one was imminent. No further communication had been made to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs by the end of the year. It appeared probable, however, that it would be necessary to confine the distribution of the British news to British subjects only. Co-operation in Anti-Locust Measures. 132. In April 1936 a request was received from the Iranian Government for the advice of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom regarding anti locust measures, particularly for use against the swarms which invade Iran from the Persian Gulf region and Baluchistan. The Iranian Government s enquiry was carefully considered by the Economic Advisory Council and the Imperial Institute of Entomology in London, and in October 1936 a long letter was sent to the head of the European Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs setting out their recommendations. It was suggested to the Iranian Government that there were two or three steps which could be usefully taken : (a) A survey of the whole southern coast of Iran, for which His Majesty’s Government or the Government of India would be happy to lend a trained entomologist, if the Iranian Government did not dispose of one. (b) The recognition by the Iranian Government of the Imperial Institute of Entomology as the international centre for anti-locust research. (c) The conclusion of an agreement for anti-locust measures with the Govern ment of India. It was subsequently suggested to the Iranian Government that this agreement might follow fairly closely the lines of the Irano-Soviet agreement on the same subject. 133. No reply was received until August 1937 when the Ministry for Foreign Affairs stated that the Imperial Government had decided to recognise the Imperial Institute of Entomology. But the result of enquiries made by His Majesty’s Legation regarding an outbreak of the desert locust in the region west of Kermanshah suggested that the Iranian Government were unlikely to provide the Imperial Institute with information of much value, for the Ministry for Foreign Affairs blandly replied that no such outbreak had taken place. With regard to the survey of the south coast of Iran, the Iranian Government’s reply received in September was simply that they already had a trained entomologist, and did not need to borrow one. Nothing was said of a survey being undertaken. His Majesty’s Legation were shortly afterwards instructed to try to arrange for a survey to be made in this region during the winter of 193/—38 by an officer of the Government of India, but, owing partly to frequent changes among the officials dealing with this question at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, it proved impossible to make any progress with this request before the end of the year. Finally, in December, the Iranian Government gave their reply to the suggestion that they should conclude an agreement with the Government of India, which was that they desired an agreement providing only for the exchange of information and not for any co-operation in anti-locust measures. Foreign Exchange Difficulties. 134. The exchange control continued to cause much hardship to many British subjects, especially Indians, throughout the year. At the beginning of the year detailed instructions, based on the experience of the working of thecontrol during 1936, were sent to His Majesty’s consular officers for the prepara tion of applications to the Exchange Control Commission. The heavy work of submitting such applications was thus greatly simplified. But it cannot be said that His Majesty’s Legation were able to achieve much to mitigate the hardship suffered by British subjects, especially those who required foreign exchange for the maintenance of dependents abroad, the education of their children, the payment of insurance premiums, &amp;c. Hr. Hajeer, the Director of the Exchange Control Commission and, after his departure in the summer on a mission to Europe, the Acting Director, Mr. Neriman, were friendly and helpful. His Majesty’s Legation were able to correspond directly with the commission and this direct contact proved useful. But the exchange position deteriorated steadily, and it became impossible for the commission to meet more than a small proportion of the demands for exchange which it received. 135. Exchange required for official purposes or for members of the staffs of His Majesty’s Legation and consulates was always forthcoming without undue delay. His Majesty’s Legation were able to obtain the regulation payment of 50 per cent, of their salaries in sterling for a number of British employees of textile companies, even in cases where the contracts providing for part payment in sterling had not received the prior sanction of the commission. A number of other applications submitted on behalf of individual British subjects were successful, but the sums involved were uniformly small. His Majesty’s Legation obtained for an employee of Cable and Wireless (Limited) permission to transfer nearly half of a sum of over £200 which he had been rash enough to leave in Iran * when transferred to India. But this was the only application of this kind to be successful. Other applications for the transfer of blocked amounts belonging to British subjects outside Iran were refused, as were all those for the transfer of the proceeds of the estates of deceased British subjects, with the exception of one trifling estate worth less than £4. In 1936 his Majesty’s Legation had had considerable correspondence with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs regarding British subjects who wished to close down their business in Iran and transfer their capital abroad. Only one such application was received in 1937, from a British Indian trader established at Zahidan whose capital amounted to no more than £75. This application was refused. The Indian goldsmith at Bandar Abbas, whose application was made a test case in 1936 (see paragraph 123 of the report for that year), continued, during the first part of the year at least, to receive exchange for the maintenance of his family and for the payment of insurance premiums. But his case seems to have been quite exceptional. The great majority of British subjects in Iran who did not receive part of their incomes in foreign exchange were unable to obtain any exchange for their families and dependents. Nearly all of these were Indians. The communities of Indian traders also suffered much from the difficulty in obtaining exchange for commercial purposes, and the consequent curtailment of their businesses. His Majesty’s Legation did not cease to make representations to the Exchange Control Commission on behalf of United Kingdom creditors whose claims have been registered with the Department of Overseas Trade, but unfortunately results were negligible. Claims. 136. The question of the claims of British subjects against the Iranian Government was further considered during the year by the Departments of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom concerned. The issue was greatly complicated by the claim brought against His Majesty’s Government by M. Atychides, a former Ottoman subject who had become an Iranian subject by naturalisation before the Great War, and whose ship, the Kara Deniz, was detained at Bombay before the outbreak of war with Turkey. This claim was for a sum much larger than the aggregate of all the British claims, and it was thought that the Iranian Government would never agree to any settlement of the British claims unless M. Atychides’ claim was also taken into account. No definite instructions had been received by His Majesty’s Legation by the end of the year. 137. No progress was made with the prosecution of the two most important British claims, namely, those of the Persian Railways Syndicate and the Iran Transport Company. At the beginning of February the acting counsellor ofBOOH 35 Ills Majesty’s Legation reminded M. Soheily, Under-Secretary at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, who was about to leave for his new post in London, of his personal suggestion for a settlement. His Majesty s Legation were subsequently instructed to confine their efforts to the maintenance of these two claims in being, pending a decision on the whole question of the British claims Doctors. 138. In August His Majesty’s Legation received from the Foreign Office the curricula and other information regarding the medical qualifications of British universities and examining bodies which have not yet been recognised by the Iranian Government. His Majesty’s Legation were thus in a position to furnish the information which the Iranian Government required before they would recognise these qualifications (see paragraph 128 of the 1936 report). It seemed possible, however, that difficulty might be caused by the enquiry made by the Iranian Government in 1936 regarding the recognition given to their own medical qualifications in the United Kingdom. These qualifications are not recognised in the United Kingdom nor is there any prospect of their recognition. It was, therefore, decided to ascertain the position with regard to Iranian medical qualifications in other countries. Enquiries were accordingly addressed to the United States, French and German Legations. By the end of the year only the American Legation had replied, and no further approach had been made to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 139 At the beginning of the year His Majesty’s Minister had decided that nothing was to be gained by pressing the request made in 1936 for the recognition of Indian medical qualifications below the status of university degrees. lor the Iranian Government had enquired what Indian qualifications were recognised in the United Kingdom and were clearly not prepared to recognise any that had not obtained the recognition of the General Medical Council. Further, the numbei of the inferior Indian medical qualifications was such that it would be impracticable for the Government of India to collect all the mfoimation required by the Iranian Government. His Majesty’s Minister, therefore, recommended to the Government of India that only the recognition of Indian medical degrees should be pursued. The Government of India agreed to this course, and in August full information regarding the medical degrees in the universities of Lucknow, Patna and the Punjab, which are not yet recognised in Iran, was furnished to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The Iranian Government’s decision had not been communicated to His Majesty’s Legation by the end of the year. 140. The prolonged negotiations over the issue of a medical licence to Captain O’Connor, medical officer on the staff of His Majesty’s consulate-general for Khorassan, have been described in paragraphs 88-91 above. In August the Ministry for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty s Legation that a geneial decision had been taken not to grant any more licences to foreign doctors on the staffs of consulates. At the time three applications from doctors on the staff of His Majesty’s consulates in Iran were outstanding. In the case of two of these, Dr. Easey, assistant surgeon at Bushire, and Dr. Mahommed Ishaq, sub-assistant surgeon at Zahidan, the applicants’ qualifications were, in any case, not recognised by the Iranian Government, and it was clear that nothing was to be gained by pursuing the matter. The case of Captain 0 Connor was on a diffeient footing, but the Government of India decided that his application should also be dropped, since he was shortly to leave Iran. The decision to lefuse medica licences to consulate doctors will cause inconvenience both in East Iran, where the medical officer will be debarred from the practice essential to any doctor, and at Bushire. At the latter post a public dispensary is still maintained and attended by large numbers of Iranian patients. The Residency surgeon is licensed, and, as long as he is present at Bushire, there should be no difficulty. But in his absence the assistant surgeon, who has no licence, must take charge of the dispensary, and it will be impossible to secure a licence foi the Residency surgeon’s successor. (Fortunately, relations between the Residency medical sta and the local authorities appear at present to be exceptionally good.) l ie Iranian Government’s decision is therefore to be regretted. But m reporting i , His Majesty’s Minister was unable to suggest any grounds on which it could be contested. Instructions on the subject were still awaited at the end of the yeai,' 36 but it seemed unlikely that it would be possible to take any action to obtain a reversal of the decision. At the end of the year there were indications that the decision would be extended to cover doctors attached to foreign missions in Tehran. Cultural Propaganda. 141. Any progress of cultural propaganda in Iran is of necessity strictly dependent on the degree to which the Iranians themselves are willing to accept it. Such advance as has been made during the year has been made possible principally by the helpful attitude of M. Hikmat, the Minister of Education, who himself strongly favours the study of English on a wider scale in Iran and the education of a greater number of Iranians in the United Kingdom. 142. During the year an offer was made by the British Council of two student bursaries for the academic year 1938-39. The Minister of Education showed considerable interest in the proposal. He considered, and His Majesty’s Minister agreed, that the supply of good teachers of English in Iran was a more pressing need than the supply of good technicians, and that such bursaries would therefore best be given to intending teachers of English in Iranian schools. Shortly afterwards the director of the National Teachers’ College of Tehran, Dr. Sadiq, who is also personally friendly, requested that, if possible, a student bursary might be granted for the year 1937-38. The British Council approved this, and arrangements were made for a student of the National Teachers’ College to attend an eighteen-months’ course at University College, Exeter, beginning in January 1938. The result of this experiment will be watched with interest, as its success or failure may affect future policy with regard to the grant of similar bursaries. An obstacle to the adoption of any scheme of regular grants is presented by the fact that at present it seems impossible to insist on any influence or control over the Iranians’ selection of students, and at the same time confidence cannot yet be placed in their exercise of the power of selection. 143. The books which the British Council had undertaken in 1936 to give to four libraries in Tehran were presented to the Minister of Education by the oriental secretary. At a small but appropriate presentation ceremony apprecia tion of the gifts seemed genuine. During the year the British Council made a further gift of £50 worth of technical books to the newly-constituted Technological Department of the University of Tehran. Technical education is still in its infancy in Iran, and the gift was appreciated as forming the nucleus of a new library. The selection of the books was based on the recommendations of Dr. Schofield, of Loughborough College, who visited Iran in 1936 to advise the Iranian Government on the development of technical education. The loan service provided by the National Central Library in London was also brought to the notice of the Ministry of Education. The British Council again presented five prize books to the Church Missionary Society College at Isfahan, and continued to supply periodicals to Iranian libraries and other institutions. A member of the Legation staff who was shown over the library of the National Teachers’ College gained the impression that the British Council’s gifts were well housed and much used. Of the library’s present total of 7,000 books, about 1,000 are English. 144. Throughout the year the Journal de Teheran continued regularly to publish extracts from the Empire programmes of the British Broadcasting Corporation. These are generally given in some detail and occupy about a half to a third of a column daily. 145. On instructions from the Foreign Office, enquiries were made of local cinema proprietors with a view to discovering whether any local demands existed for British documentary films. The result of the enquiries, though disappointing, was of some interest as reflecting the mentality and preferences of Iranian audiences. It was found that Iranians prefer long films, and show little interest in short subsidiary films; that they like action and elaborate spectacle, and would inevitably be bored by films dealing with, say, industry or sport; and that they prefer films in French to those in any other language. In these circumstances, it was impossible to recommend any attempt to distribute British documentary films in the country.m 37 Consular Affairs. 146. The long drawn out negotiations for the purchase of a site for His Majesty’s consulate at Ahwaz advanced considerably during the year. At the beginning of the year there were anxious moments when it appeared that the Iranian Government intended to go back on the assurance given in April 1936 that there would be no difficulty over the sale of the land to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. The Ministry of Education and even higher quarters appeared to have designs on the site. Eventually at the end of April, after constant pressure from His Majesty’s Legation, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs stated officially that the Iranian Government agreed to the sale of the site to His Majesty’s Government, provided no request for any more land was made in the future. The remainder of the year was spent in negotiations over the exact price and other details. It was found that there was a discrepancy between the figures held by His Majesty’s Legation and those held by the Ministry of Finance for the areas of the different portions of the site (the value of which varied greatly owing to the liability to flooding of parts of the site). The site was accurately resurveyed by a surveyor of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, but the results of his survey had not been accepted by the Iranian Government at the end of the year, as a rexamination of the site by the local authorities was still awaited. Diffi culties arose through the claim of the municipality that a strip 30 metres wide along the river bank was their property under Iranian law, and also through their desire to build a road across a part of the site. After negotiations with the Minister of Finance, a compromise was reached locally, by which the two strips of land would be sold to His Majesty’s Government on the condition that they would be resold to the municipality at the same price if required for the construc tion of roads. This compromise was accepted by His Majesty’s Government, subject to a ten-year limit to the obligation to resell the strip for the road across the site. The Iranian Government’s agreement to the compromise as accepted by His Majesty’s Government was awaited at the end of the year. 147. The death of the Sheikh of Mohammerah in 1936 gave rise to some difficulty over the tenure of His Majesty’s vice-consulate at Khorramshahr. The house, which was his property, had been occupied for many years without any formal lease, the same rent having been paid annually to the sheikh since the house was first taken in 1892. The sheikh left a large number of heirs, whose affairs were in great confusion, and it was not known whether the Iranian Government would allow them to inherit his property in Khuzistan. Attempts were made in 1936 to discover from the representative of the heirs what the exact position as regards the vice-consulate was, but without success. It was believed that Colonel Bayendor had his eye on this property, which would make a most suitable Admiralty House. In these circumstances it was clearly of great importance to obtain a valid lease of the property as soon as possible. This was likely to be very difficult, and, as it was not even known to whom the rent should now be paid, as a first step it was decided to put this enquiry to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. In spite of constant reminders it was not possible to obtain any reply before the end of the year. Thus, nothing could be done to obtain a proper lease. 148. The maintenance of the consular rest-house and office at Isfahan for a second year was sanctioned during the year. The results of the first year’s working showed that the experiment had been well justified. His Majesty s consul at Shiraz paid two visits of about a month each to Isfahan, while for four months in the summer the house was occupied by Messrs. Sarell and Cecil, pro bationer vice-consuls attached for language study to His Majesty’s consulate at Shiraz. His Majesty’s Legation were thus able to obtain a considerable amount of information regarding the Isfahan district, while a tour made by Mr. Sarell through a part of the Bakhtiari country provided valuable information about the condition of the Bakhtiari tribes, of which little had been heard since the discontinuance of the Bakhtiari tour formerly made each year by His Majesty’s consul at Ahwaz. 149. As in recent years, as many visits as possible were exchanged with His Majesty’s consular officers in Iran. Official liaison visits to Tehran were made by His Majesty’s consuls at Ahwaz, Shiraz and Tabriz and by the acting British vice-consul at Khorramshahr. Every consular post in Iran, with the exception of Kerman and Bandar Abbas, was visited during the year either by His38 Majesty’s Minister or by a member of the staff of His Majesty s Legation. The direct contact between His Majesty’s Legation and His Majesty s consular officers which these visits provide has proved of great value. 150. No progress whatever was made with the proposed redefinition of British consular districts in Iran. At the end of the year the whole question was thrown into the melting pot again by the reorganisation of the provinces described in paragraph 248 below, which will make new definitions of all the districts necessary. It will hardly be possible to attempt to frame new definitions until the new organisation has crystallised. (2) Australia. 151. Colonel C. E. Hughes was appointed during the year to be Australian Trade Commissioner in a number of Near Eastern countries, including Iran, with headquarters at Cairo. It had not been possible for Colonel Hughes to visit Iran by the end of the year. (B) Iraq. Frontier Dispute and Negotiations for an Agreement. 152. In 1936 Irano-Iraqi relations had centred round the negotiations for frontier settlement including the question of future control of the Shatt-el- Arab; not much progress could be recorded. In 1937 the latter question was for the greater part of the year left in abeyance, in accordance with the hints, if not actual advice, of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and such rapid progress was made with the frontier question that it was possible to foresee early in the year that a treaty would be signed and the main lines of the agreement that it would register. And in fact the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Naji-el-Asil, visited Tehran in July and signed the treaty determining the frontier. It was only during Dr. Naji’s visit that His Majesty’s Legation took any part in the negotiations, which apart from this period were conducted in Bagdad. 153. As far, therefore, as the frontier problem was concerned, the belief entertained in London in 1936 that without the good offices of His Majesty’s Government negotiations would stagnate, was not justified. It was rather a case of the Iraqi Government pushing matters too quickly. Nor, after what they regarded as the rebuffs of the previous year, did the Iranian Government again seek the help of His Majesty’s Government. Both parties, especially Iraq, turned to the Turks for assistance. Early in the year the Iraqi and Iranian Governments were already nearing an agreement on the following lines which by June were embodied in an agreed treaty :— (1) The land frontier should be as laid down in the Protocol of 1913, and in the minutes of the Frontier Delimitation Commission of the following year. The Persians thus abandoned their tiresome face-saving demand that the frontier should be redelimited in the treaty from north to south. (2) Opposite Abadan the Iranian Government should receive from the Iraqi Government an anchorage or strip of water some four miles in length, from opposite jetty No. 1 in the north to near the north end of the Island of Shutait in the south and extending over this stretch to the thalweg of the river. (3) The Shatt-el-Arab to be open to the mercantile marine of all nations, shipping dues to be levied on the basis of the cost of upkeep and administration of the river. (4) The river to be free to the warships and other non-commercial vessels of Iraq and Iran. (5) The two contracting parties to negotiate subsequently an agreement regarding the navigation and maintenance of the river, and various other river questions, such as the prevention of smuggling. This provision as regards the future was eventually embodied in a protocol which formed an integral part of the treaty and was signed at the same time.39 154. In January His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom considered resuming the initiative abandoned in January 1936, and a number of possible proposals were discussed. The most notable features were that the Iranian Government should receive a strip of river up to the thalweg opposite Abadan, that two national boards should be set up whereby each Government should control its section of the river under a third central co-ordinating board, more or less confined to advisory functions, on which His Majesty’s Government would be represented; and further, provision should be made for the inter nationalisation or freeing of the river for world trade, and the warships of all countries. 155. The attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the cession of the thalweg had, it should be noted, been altered by Colonel Ward’s assurances that there was, in fact, water enough opposite Abadan to allow for the passage within Iraqi waters of any ships which could pass through the Rooka Channel, and that the cession would be innocuous provided the ceded anchorage did not commence further up river than Jetty No. 1. 156. The general feeling of His Majesty’s Legation as regards these proposals was that the offer of the thalweg opposite Abadan came too late to make the remaining proposals substantially more attractive to the Iranian Government than what they hoped to obtain by direct negotiation with the Iraqi Government, the Turk acting as friend of both. His Majesty’s Embassy in Bagdad felt that the proposals had been already rather left behind by the march of the direct negotiations, but that the idea of separate boards and their respective duties was valuable, and might usefully be revived at a future time. 157. The British proposals were, in the circumstances, not pursued, and subsequently His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, broadly speaking, concentrated on endeavouring to persuade the Iraqi negotiators to safe guard the following three points :— (1) That the cession of the anchorage opposite Abadan should in no circum stances of peace or war prejudice the legal right and physical ability of the ships of war of Iraq and her allies and of other ships used on non-commercial Government service, to pass freely through the navigable channel of the Shatt-al-Arab. (2) That in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, it should remain the duty and right of the Iraqi Government to dredge and maintain the navigable channel on both sides of the thalweg, i.e., to safeguard the existing position as regards maintenance, until an agreement as regards future control of the river should have been negotiated on satisfactory lines, subsequent to the conclusion of the frontier treaty. (3) That the Rooka Channel, where the river debouches into the Gulf, should remain indisputably under Iraqi sovereignty. 158. Apart from the above, the general attitude of His Majesty’s Govern ment was that what the Iranian Government now proposed offered a prospect of a final settlement of a century-old frontier problem; that it was desirable that this settlement should take as full and lasting effect as possible, and that Iraq should not be dissuaded from making all reasonable concessions to that end, provided they were compatible with her vital interests. 159. Towards the end of January the Tehran manager of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company raised a side-complication, which was causing anxiety to the company. As a consequence of their greatly increased output, it had become urgently necessary to increase the number of loading jetties. The only place for these considered suitable by the company was near Qusbeh, further down the River Shatt from Abadan; the water there was, of course, Iraqi; the Shah was understood to have committed himself to the principle that where the company’s jetties were, there the water must be Iranian, and His Majesty was also reluctant ito introduce a fresh demand for a further section of the river into the negotiations with Iraq at such a late stage. The company, therefore, saw themselves confronted with the alternatives of seeking to persuade reluctant Iranian and British Govern ments to press the Iraqis during the current negotiations to concede a further anchorage opposite Qusbeh, or of building their jetties in some expensive and•me m r IIJBlI'l t 40 unsuitable place, such as Bandar Shahpur, or of inducing the Shah o waive i principle for the time at least, but with the prospect sooner 01 later o a ur e Irano-Iraqi dispute about sovereignty over the waters round the new je xes a Qusbeh. The matter was referred to His Majesty’s Government m the United Kingdom, who decided that they could not at this late stage bring an Y on the Iraqi Government to concede yet more of the river In April the a waived his principle, and gave the company permission to build their jetties at Qusbeh, provided that their construction work was not less than o ° m - ( 18 an from a point on the Iranian bank of the river opposite the Iraqi vi age o ao. The Qusbeh site was later found to be unsuitable, but another site nearer Abadan was agreed upon. 160. By the beginning of May the two Governments were very near an agreement on a draft treaty, and the Iraqi Government enlisted the good omces of the Turks, persuading the President of the Turkish Republic to make a personal appeal to the Shah to effect an early settlement with Iraq on the basis ol the draft treaty under discussion. Dr. Naji subsequently told His Majesty s Ambassador in Bagdad that Turkish help had been of great value, and that he was most grateful for it. By the middle of June a text had virtually been agree upon, and on the 22nd June both the Iranian Prime Minister and Minister tor Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Minister that in view of the satisfactory course of the negotiations the Shatt-al-Arab boundary question could be regarded as settled. The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Aras, who arrived m Tehran from Bagdad at the end of the month, played a part in removing the last outstanding difficulties. 161. The Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs arrived in Tehran on the 1st July with the avowed intention of signing first the Frontier Treaty with Iran, and then the Middle East Four-Power Non-Aggression Pact, for the signature of which the Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs had been urgently invited to Tehran. His Majesty’s Minister was instructed at this point by the Foreign Office to impress upon Dr. Naji that he should not commit himself to any settlement that did not provide for the continuance of Iraq’s existing rights as regards dredging and maintenance of the river pending the conclusion of a new convention on this subject. His Majesty’s Minister obtained an interview with Dr. Naji on the 2nd July, the day after his arrival, and emphasised the view of His Majesty’s Government. Dr. Naji informed His Majesty’s Minister on the 4th July that he had felt obliged to accept an arrangement by which both parties to the treaty agreed to use all their efforts to conclude within one year a convention determining the future regime on the river, and if they were unable to do so the period might be prolonged by another year; the Iraqi Government would continue conservancy work for the period of one year and for any further period of extension. The Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs was convinced that this was the best arrangement that could be obtained in the circumstances. 162. In the course of the earlier interview Dr. Naji explained to His Majesty’s Minister the latest Persian suggestion as regards another of the points on which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had been feeling concern, namely, the freedom of passage for British warships and non-commercial ships up to Basra and down. The Persian draft provided that permission given by one party for such visits by vessels of a third State should be considered as given by the other party also. Visiting ships would then have the right to make use of the waters of both parties for passage. No distinction was drawn between times of peace and war. This proposal was regarded as satisfactory by His Majesty’s Government and was duly included in the treaty. Also, to meet the wishes of His Majesty’s Government, the Iraqi Government obtained the insertion of an article in the protocol which stated that nothing in the treaty impaired the rights of Iraq or the obligations which she had undertaken vis-a-vis His Majesty’s Government as regards the Shatt-el-Arab in their treaty of 1930 and the annex of the same date. 163. The Frontier Treaty and the protocol regarding the ceded anchorage and future regime on the river which formed a part of it were signed on the day of the second interview, the 4th July. The Four-Power Pact was signed four days later at the Imperial summer residence at Saadabad. Further reference to41 this pact is made in paragraphs 233-237. In conversation with Dr. Naji the Sha was good enough to inform him that he entirely approved the foreign policy o I raq, based on the Anglo-Iraqi Alliance. 164. His Majesty’s Minister was authorised, in the course of the festivities that accompanied the signature of these treaties, to offer the four loreign Ministers concerned the Secretary of State’s congratulations in general terms. The most difficult part of the Irano-Iraqi settlement might still be ahead, but Mis Majesty’s Government, as a friend of both parties, warmly welcomed the settle ment of the long-drawn-out frontier dispute and the improvement in Irano-Iraqi relations which it would bring about. 165. The most difficult part of the Irano-Iraqi dispute, viz. the River Convention, was hardly discussed by Dr. Naji in Tehran. In October ms successor, Tawfiq Suwaidi, informed His Majesty’s Charge d Affaires m Bagda that he favoured a tri-partite convention or, at least, some method by wlucn tne influence of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom might be enlisted to support Iraq against Iran; but he feared that Iran would react unfavoura y to a direct suggestion from him that His Majesty’s Government should participate, and suggested that His Majesty’s Government might do some preparatory sounding. The Foreign Office response to this was that, as the proposed conven tion arose out of a treaty between Iraq and Iran, it was for the Iraqi Government to inform Iran that it was their wish that His Majesty’s Government should be a party to the convention; the Iraqi Government could count on the full support of His Majesty’s Government in pressing this point. Shortly afterwards lfc wa ® reported that the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs were working out a draft of a bi-partite convention. 166. In November the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs visited Bagdad, and made it clear that he was opposed to British participation in the convention. M. Samiy took the line that the convention was not an urgent matter, and that Iran would be prepared to see the existing efficient management of the river continue indefinitely, or for some three or four years, during which time general relations would be sweetened. This seemed inconsistent with the piovision in the protocol that a convention should be concluded within one year, but M. Samiy appeared to think that this apparent inconsistency could easily be sui mounted. 167. In December the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Ambassador in Badgad that the draft convention under preparation was bi-partite in form, and that the constitution of the board was under discussion, with three alternative formulae as regards the third member. He might (a) be chosen by the Iraqi and Iranian Governments from among the nationals of the State which had most shipping on the river during the previous five years; (b) be appointed by Iraq and Iran from among British nationals nominated by the Government of the United Kingdom; or (c) he might be a national of a neutral State. Tawfiq Suwaidi seemed strongly in favour of (a), believing that the Iranian Government could not be persuaded to accept alternative (b). Mean while the Frontier Treaty had not been ratified by the Iraqi Parliament, and if Iran pressed for ratification it was his intention to insist that it should be accom panied by an exchange of notes providing that, until the convention were con cluded, the Iraqi Government should continue to control all the relevant Shaft services. 168 His Majesty’s Ambassador emphasised to Tawfiq Suwaidi the well- known British desiderata, including the right to be a signatory of the convention and to have equal representation on the river board. The Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that, in view of Persian opposition, insistence on these demands would rule out any hope of a settlement. 169. The year closed on the Shatt-el-Arab itself with the Iranian port officer at Khorramshahr fining the master of an Italian vessel 500 rials for a collision that occurred in Iraqi waters. The Iraqi Government proposed to make strong representations on the subject. Other Agreements. 170. Towards the end of January the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Ambassador in Bagdad of a communication he had had42 from the Iranian Government to the effect that if negotiations as regards the frontier disputes were successfully concluded, the Iranian Government would be prepared, after signing that treaty, to sign also the Middle-East Non-Aggression Pact, and then proceed without delay to negotiate agreements with Iraq on a variety of other subjects. 171. Accordingly after Dr. Naji-al-Asil had signed in Tehran in July the Frontier Treaty and the Four-Power Pact and taken a few days holiday in Mazanderan, he returned to Tehran and continued work with his Iranian colleague on a draft treaty for the Pacific Settlement of Disputes. This was signed on the 24th July. 172. The only at all unusual feature appeared to be article 20, which provided that the treaty should apply as between the contracting parties even when a third Power had an interest in the dispute. His Majesty’s Minister asked the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs if this was not a novelty and likely to lead to a complicated position if the third Power found itself unable to accept the settlement reached by the other two. M. Samiy also thought that the article was a novelty and did not muchjhke it; he said that it had figured in the original draft initialled in 1935, and he had not liked to pursue his own inclination to drop it. M. Samiy did not attach much importance to the article, and this proved also to be the attitude of the Foreign Office in London. 173. Apart from this, the treaty, to the satisfaction of Iraq, provided in certain cases for reference to the League of Nations, and to the Permanent Court of Justice at the Hague. 174. Dr. Naji-al-Asil on his return from Mazanderan also signed a Treaty of Friendship with Iran providing for diplomatic reciprocity and laying down that seven further agreements on other subjects should be concluded as soon as possible. The seven subjects were defined as :— (1) A good neighbourly Convention to provide for frontier security and the settlement of frontier disputes. (2) Extradition Treaty. (3) Treaty as to Establishment and Nationality. (4) Commercial Treaty. (5) Convention on judiciary assistance. (6) Consular Convention. (7) Convention regarding Posts and Telegraphs. 175. One point of interest to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom arose in connexion with this Treaty of Friendship. When it had come up previously in tentative form in Bagdad, His Majesty’s Government had been anxious that the Iraqi Government should ensure, possibly by an exchange of notes, that the Iranian Government should recognise that the representative of His Majesty’s Government at Bagdad was entitled, under the terms of an annex to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance, to be perpetually dean of the Diplomatic Body. Therefore, His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad, on learning that this treaty was about to be signed, telegraphed to His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran suggesting that he should see the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs did not overlook this requirement of His Majesty’s Government. This reminder arrived after the text of the treaty had been agreed upon between Dr. Naji and M. Samiy. His Majesty’s Minister mentioned the point to Dr. Naji, who replied that he had explained to M. Samiy the provision of the annex in question, that the Iranian Government understood the position, but that the question would not arise as the latter did not intend to raise the status of their mission in Bagdad. The above was oral; nothing in writing passed between the two Governments on the subject. 176. In the course of the year the Irano-Iraqi Provisional Agreement of December 1932 for the Settlement of Frontier Incidents was renewed for two further periods of six months from the 7th December, 1936, and the 7th June, 1937, respectively. Military Questions. 177. Early in the year His Majesty’s Legation received a copy of a despatch addressed by His Majesty’s Ambassador in Bagdad to the Foreign Office43 referring to the belief entertained by the then chief of the Iraqi General Staif, the late General Bekr Sidqi, that an attack by Iran on Iraq was a menace sufficiently real to call for a notable increase in the military forces of Iraq. 178. His Majesty’s Legation, asked to comment on this belief, submitted a detailed appreciation of the position. The conclusion reached was that Iran could not and would not take the field against Iraq at present, and that as regards the foreseeable future the improvements anticipated in the Iraqi forces were likely to exceed those effected in the forces of Iran, so that an attack on . Iraq would be so dangerous to Iran as to be highly improbable. 179. Four Iraqi officers came by invitation to see the Iranian military review in February, and there seems no doubt that they were impressed both by the improvement in the Iranian troops and by their military equipment. Further, early in the year the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad that the serious nature of various incidents on the Irano- Iraqi border made him anxious to conclude the frontier treaty negotiations as soon as possible. 180. In May the Iraqi authorities experienced a hardy annual scare, and His Majesty’s Legation were asked to comment on a story that 24,000 Iranian troops had been concentrated round Ahwaz and Khorramshahr, possibly with a view to supporting the settlement of a colony of Persian tribes among the Arabs of Khuzistan. His Majesty’s consul at Ahwaz reported that there had been no concentration in Ahwaz or Khorramshahr beyond the normal, and that he did not credit any unusual movement of troops in Khuzistan since their return from manoeuvres. 181. At the end of the year the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs complained that the Iranian Government had arrested an Iraqi cadet and two soldiers engaged in a topographical exercise on the Iraqi side of the Irano-Iraqi frontier. Suppression of Film Offensive to Iran. 182. In the course of the summer the Iraqi Government showed up in favourable contrast to the French authorities in Beirut by forbidding the display in Bagdad of a film entitled “Leila, Daughter of the Desert,’’ to which the Iranian Government took exception as being derogatory to Iran. (C) Other Countries. Afghanistan. 183. Irano-Afghan relations were marred by no incidents during the year, and the beginnings of greater intimacy were explicit in the association of hcffh countries in the Four-Power Middle East Non-Aggression Pact, to sign which the Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs visited Tehran by invitation m July. As a sequel, arrangements were agreed on between the signatories for future consultation and co-operation in foreign affairs, the first fruits of which were seen in the support given to Iran at Geneva in September for the seat on the Council of the League of Nations vacated by Turkey. Prior to the conclusion of the pact the Afghan Government had regarded it as of little practical importance; they can hardly have foreseen the closer association provided for in the course of the signature at Tehran. It remains to be seen whether this will be reflected in the avoidance or in the smoother treatment of incidents between the two countries. 184. The Afghan Ambassador, Sher Ahmed, dean of the Diplomatic Body at Tehran who did not disguise his low opinion of Iran, was recalled to Kabul in May, and was succeeded by a milder personality, Ahmad Ali, a cousin of the King of Afghanistan. A ustna 185 The Treaty of Friendship and Arbitration between Austria and Iran, concluded at Angora on the 23rd September, 1936, was ratified by the Majlis on the 5th June. A further “Convention d’Etablissement signed at the same time at Angora had not been presented to the Majlis nor published by the end44 % of the year. An article published in the official Wiener Zeitung at Vienna in August suggested that other agreements between the two countries were contem plated for the fostering of trade. In the latter half of the year the Iranian Government purchased locomotives from Austria for the Trans-Iranian Railway. The Austrian Minister, resident in Moscow, did not visit Iran during 1937. Belgium. 186. A vigorous Belgian Minister, M. Graeffe, arrived from Berlin in January. Soon after his arrival the Iranian Government took the drastic step of forbidding altogether the importation of Belgian goods into Iran, arising out of a dispute over a cargo of Iranian wheat bought by a British firm and re-directed to Belgium. The dispute was soon settled by Belgium buying 250 tons of Iranian barley. 187. Belgian interests in Iran remained almost entirely commercial, apart from the Air Mission. This, as reported in paragraph 304 of last year’s report, now consists of Colonel Bever alone; the contracts of none of the other members were renewed after expiry. Colonel Bever’s contract retains him until May 1939. There was no suggestion during the year that the mission would be replaced by that of any other nationality. Czechoslovakia. 188. Messrs. Skoda are well organised in Iran and the Iranian Government turn to them largely both for military equipment and in the industrial development of the country. The firm were active throughout the year. The Czechoslovak Legation keep a watchful eye upon German activities. Denmark. 189. The Danish Minister, M. Engell, normally resident in Moscow, who had not visited Iran in 1936, came to Tehran in February and stayed for a month. During his stay, which was mainly for the purpose of presenting to the Shah the Danish Order of the Elephant, occurred the formal opening of the northern sector of the Trans-Iranian Railway, at the new Tehran railway station, by the Shah. The bestowal of the decoration was presumably in connexion with the completion of this work under the supervision of the mainly Danish Kampsax Consortium. Nevertheless, M. Engell, like the rest of his diplomatic colleagues, was not invited to the ceremony at the railway station. The Iranian Minister at Copenhagen, on behalf of the Shah, presented a return decoration to the King of Denmark in October. 190. Also while M. Engell was in Tehran the Majlis passed a Bill to engage a Danish expert, Dr. Blegvad, to survey fishery possibilities in the Persian Gulf with a view to the creation of an Iranian fishing industry. The contract was for two years, but for only six months in each year, and at a salary of £300 per working month, with free accommodation and passage from and to Denmark. British authorities felt some anxiety that Dr. Blegvad’s researches might create trouble over Arab pearling rights and interests, and the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf kept in close touch with him. Dr. Blegvad seems to have conducted himself with complete discretion. The reports rendered by Dr. Blegvad to the Iranian authorities during the year are believed to have been fairly optimistic. 191. In July it was announced that M. Engell was being transferred as Minister to Stockholm as from the 1st January, 1938. Enquiry from the Charge d’Affaires in Tehran elicited that it was not proposed to accredit his successor at Moscow to Iran also. It seems probable, therefore, that in 1938 Danish interests in Iran will be represented by the experienced Charge d’Affaires, M. Blechingberg. Egyyt. 192. Throughout the year the Egyptian Minister was absent at his other posts Kabul and Bagdad, or ill in Cairo; he was, therefore, not present to give a lead to his Legation when the Turkish, Iraqi and Afghan Ministers for Foreign Affairs gathered at Tehran to sign the Four-Power Middle-Eastern Pact. Rumours were current that Egypt hankered to use her newly-acquiredv 45 independence to join this Islamic group, and this theory was fostered by a tendency of the Egyptian Legation to hang about the representatives of the four Powers. Three individuals acted at different times as Charge d Affaires during Rahman Azzam’s absence. Egyptian interests in Iran seemed virtually non-existent. 193. In July the Iranian Government’s indignation was aroused by the presentation in Cairo and certain other countries of a fdm made in Cairo in Arabic entitled “Leila, Daughter of the Desert.” In the Iranian view the story of this film reflected in a derogatory as well as unhistorical manner on King Khosroes of Persia. In vain did the Egyptian Legation invite the Iranian authorities to sanction any Iranian film however it might represent Cleopatra or other Egyptian figures of the past; the Iranian Minister was withdrawn from Cairo, and replaced after some months by one who have previously served there as Minister. Finland. 194. In October the Finnish Minister, resident in Moscow, paid a visit of about a month to Tehran, accompanied by his wife. Baron \ rjo-Koskinen was received in audience by the Shah. France. 195. Irano-French relations were troubled by articles in the press, as in 1936, and in spite of efforts by the French Government, remained unsettled and unsatisfactory. Early in the year the transfer to English uni\ersities of the Iranian students holding State scholarships in I ranee (see paragiaph 129 above) seems actually to have been decided upon by the Iranian Government and only not carried into effect because of the practical difficulties. The French Legation, too, had difficulty in securing an agrement for their new Minister, M. Bodard, whose previous post had been Addis Ababa; and officers of the Fiench Military Mission were made to encounter unexpected and novel difficulties and hindrances. 196 In August the French Government sent out M. Honor at, a Senator and former Minister of Public Instruction, on a mission for the promotion of cultural relations. He presented the Shah with the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour, and brought gifts to various Tehran institutions. In turn, M. Honorat was feted and made Honorary Doctor of the University ot lehran, and appropriate Iranian decorations were bestowed on him and members of the French Legation. The good effect of this visit was, however, spoiled by a foolish article in a Paris newspaper commenting on the Queen of Iran s visit to Europe, which drew venomous rejoinders in the officially controlled Tehran newspapers. According to the Iranian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, this incident made it impossible to fill the post of Iranian Minister in Pans, vacant since early in the year through the recall of M. Ferouhar. 197. In March the sloop D’Iberville visited Khorramshahr, Abadan and Bushire and its officers were entertained by the commander of the Iranian southern naval forces. In July Air France inaugurated an additiona weekly air-mail service to India and Siam via Bushire and Jask, and a direct weekly air mail to Indo-China. Germany. 198. German activity, commercial and other, continued unabated throughou 937. The clearing agreement, though continuing tobe of great advantage o Germany’s export trade, encountered interruptions and difficulties which seemed iot to have been overcome by the year’s end. M. Hajis, president of the Iranian Exchange Control Commission, went to Berlin m June and remained there fo [early three months. It is reported that he endeavoured to obtain two years ‘ rebate ” in respect of the deficit under the Irano-German Clearing Agi cement, iut failed in his mission, as he was unable to furnish statistics required showing xports from Iran. In May the German Iranian Chamber of Commerce issued , statement in Berlin to the effect that interruptions m the clearing were mainly lue to German exports to Iran having risen to a much larger extent than Ham xports to Germany, and that the chamber’s estimate that Germany s export urplus during the first quarter would amount to 10 million reichsmarks had46 proved correct. Reference was made to a procedure suggested by the National Bank of Iran involving the release by German exporters of documents against payment in rials, and on the whole exporters were advised, where possible, to retain documents until the conversion of the whole claim into reichsmarks had been effected. All parties concerned in German-Iranian trade were urgently invited to help in overcoming the existing difficulties. At the end of the year the balance against Iran was estimated at about 50 million reichsmarks, with the result that the Government restricted the issue of import permits for German goods. 199. A large order for locomotives and rolling-stock for the railway did not, after long negotiation, go to the German Ferrostahl group, probably because the latter could not secure satisfactory arrangements for payment. Eventually, locomotives were supplied by Austria, and Skoda seemed likely to, supply some of the rolling-stock. But the foundations of Iran’s first iron-foundry were laid at Aminabad, near Tehran, under German auspices, and Germany supplied much of the machinery of an immense tobacco factory opened by the Shah in Tehran in November. 200. Germany was particularly active as regards aviation. Early in March two officers of the German air force, one a son of Field-Marshal Blomberg, Minister of War, flew a double-engined Junkers machine, a bomber in civilian dress, from Egypt to Tehran en route from Kabul. On its return journey the machine flew from Kabul to Jask and on from Kerman to Damascus. His Majesty’s Legation were instructed by the Foreign Office that they and consular officers in Iran should befriend these two aviators. Literally and politically this flight was part of a long-distance policy, civil and military. 201. On the civil side an agent of Luft-Hansa attached to the German Legation prosecuted throughout the year the service across Iran for passengers and mails to Kabul and China, in which Dr. Schacht had sought the concurrence of the Iranian Government at the end of 1936. Eventually, consent was given to nine trial flights, which were duly carried out. Some of the machines involved flew from Kabul on to China, and encountered serious difficulties on this last section. By the end of the year it seemed probable that, if they still so desired, the German Government would be able to obtain permission for a permanent service, subject to pretty stiff conditions; but in October proposals were made to the German air authorities elsewhere which might affect their desire to establish a service to China via Iran. 202. The German Government obtained the sanction of the Iraqi Govern ment for this service in April, but His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had reason to think that they were winning permission from the Governments concerned individually, by representing untruthfully that the permissions of all the other Governments were already forthcoming, and His Majesty’s Legation, as well as His Majesty’s other missions concerned, were instructed to take steps, if they thought this feasible, to undeceive the Iranian Government. The Foreign Office were informed that, in view of the very close association of the Foreign Ministers of Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan and their staffs at Tehran in July, there seemed little doubt that the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs was accurately informed as to the true position between the German Government and the Governments of Iraq and Afghanistan; it was therefore not proposed to make any communication to the Iranian Ministry for Foreign Affairs for the present. 203. At the end of October a Junkers bombing machine arrived at Tehran with a German crew and gave a series of demonstrations of flying and bombing with dummy bombs. Iranian air force officers were taken up, but not allowed to fly the machine, J.U. 86k, an obsolescent type. The demonstrations were not an unqualified success, but there was an unconfirmed rumour in December that, as a result of the visit, twenty Iranian officers and non-commissioned officers were leaving to do a maintenance course in Germany, and also that an order had been placed for twenty machines of the type J.U. 86. 204. In December Herr Baldur von Schirach, head of the Hitler Jugend, paid a brief visit to Tehran during the celebration of the third anniversary of the Iranian Boy Scout movement. Herr von Schirach was given a very friendly47 reception and his visit had much publicity. He was received by both the Shah and the Valiahd, and saw several Cabinet Ministers. He also attended a number of demonstrations by boy scouts and girl guides. This visit from another of Germany’s leading personalities, following on that of Dr. Schacht a year previously, indicates sufficiently the trouble that the German Government are prepared to take to court Iran. A beautifully prepared book of photographs illustrating modern and ancient Iran, taken by a German who was guest at the German Legation in 1936, and with a foreword by the German Foreign Minister, contrasted, unhappily for His Majesty’s Legation, with certain British publi cations on Iran during the year. 205. Statistics are not available, but the number of Germans in Iran must have continued to increase in 1937. No consular office has, however, yet been opened at Isfahan, and German, or Hansa Line, designs for getting in on the bottom floor at Bandar Shahpur and developing it in rivalry to Khorramshahr seem to have been laid aside, at any rate for the present, as a result of the melancholy conditions prevailing at that port. Greece. 206. After the departure early in the year of the melancholy delegation of three Government officials who visited Tehran at the end of 1936, nothing further transpired during the year as regards the establishment of a Greek Legation. Hungary. 207. In December the Hungarian Government accredited a Minister, M. de Mariassy, to Iran. He visited Tehran in December and signed two agreements, a treaty of friendship and arbitration, and a commercial agreement. M. de Mariassy saw no basis for expecting much result from the latter. M. de Mariassy is accredited also to Iraq and Turkey and resides at Angora. He left Tehran after a stay of three weeks. Italy. 208. Although the Charg6 d’Affaires, whose methods created so unfavour able an impression in the latter half of 1936, was replaced in June by a Minister, late Italian consul-general at Ottawa, of broader outlook, there was no indication throughout the year that Iran regarded Italy with any increasing sympathy. Nor did the Italian Legation seem happy within itself. Many conflicting interpretations were placed upon the Middle-Eastern Four-Power Pact, but no one professed to regard it as a success for Italy; most people considered the diplomatic defence that it seemed to offer against her as one of its greater merits. 209. The Iranian navy on the Persian Gulf continued to be tutored by Italian naval officers, and though one sloop came in for displeased criticism from the Shah when His Imperial Majesty visited Khorramshahr in March, the Italian-trained Colonel Bayendor, Commander of the Southern Naval Forces, survived that ordeal and a visit to Tehran later in the year. The agreeable Italian naval attache continued a bored and not conspicuously active existence in Tehran. 210. Towards the end of the year Commander Bigi admitted to his Turkish military colleague that his Government were trying to sell Sarvia-Marchetti bombing machines with specially designed undercarriages to the Iranian (as to the Iraqi and Afghan) Government. This came to nothing : possibly the Berlin-Rome axis involved leaving the bombing field in Tehran to German efforts. 211. In May an Italian subject named Pastori was reported to have visited Bandar Abbas and Muscat to obtain labour on a large scale for road construction in Eritrea, and to be proceeding to Tehran to negotiate an arrangement with the Iranian Government, but nothing further was heard of this. Japan. 212. In October a new Japanese Minister arrived in Tehran. In Japan's conflict with China, Iranian feeling appeared to be very strongly anti-Japanese. 213. In April a report was received that a Japanese company was intending to send a trawler on a voyage to survey fishing grounds in the Indian Ocean andORMM 48 neighbouring seas, in the course of which she would visit the Persiaji A s in the case of the Iranian survey begun in 1936 by the Danish expert Dr. a &gt; it was feared that difficulties might arise over the Arab pearl banks on the high seas. His Maiesty’s Embassy at Tokyo therefore made enquiries of the Japanese Government regarding the intentions of the trawler company, and i was ir L that the special position in the Persian Gulf might cause complications. e reply received stated that the scheme to send the trawler to the Persian Gult had been abandoned for the moment. 1\I BOCICO 214. On the 24th March Mexican and Iranian representatives signed at Buenos Aires a treaty of friendship providing inter aha for the establishment of diplomatic and consular relations between the two countries. Norway. 215. The Norwegian Minister, who resides in Moscow, did not visit Iran in 1937. Early in the year His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire who Iras charge of Norwegian interests there, reported that a newly-appointed Norwegian Trade Commissioner was expected to visit the Persian Gulf. Roumania. 216. M. Constantinesco, first Roumanian Minister in Iran, who left on leave and for reasons of health towards the end of 1937, did not return. He received another appointment during the year; his post at Tehran was not filled, and Roumanian interests were in the hands of a Charge d Affaires through out the year. Sweden. 217 During 1937 relations between Sweden and Iran were entirely commercial. The business transacted by the Demavend Trading Company declined, but the constructional company, Sentab, obtained further orders tor bridges and wharves in Khuzistan. Turkey. 218. The existing excellent relations were consolidated during the year first by M. Cemal Husnu, who, after seven months’ stay in Tehran, succeeded in concluding a large number of agreements listed in paragraph 238 of this report; and later by the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, who visited Tehran at the end of June. At his own request he was transported from Bagdad as far as Kermanshah in a large British military aeroplane, the Iranian Government making no difficulties. Dr. Aras helped in the final stages of the Irano-Iraqi Frontier Treaty; signed the Four-Power Middle Fast Non-Aggression Pact, and used the prestige accruing to him as a very senior Minister for Foreign Affairs to establish himself, without giving offence, as interpreter to some extent of the international ideals and aspirations of a progressive and independent Middle East. His interpretation bore a strong Geneva flavour, and showed special regard for Iran’s “ two great neighbours.” In accordance with an agreement published in Tehran, Turkey and the two other signatories of the pact helped Iran successfully to obtain the seat on the Council of the League of Nations vacated by Turkey, but the support of the three was not successful in obtaining for her a semi-permanent seat. Of greater importance possibly to Turco-Iranian relations are the permanent consultation and co-operation, including annual meetings, between representatives of the four Powers that were also provided for in the communique published in Tehran. On the occasion of the dispute over the Sanjak of Alexandretta no very conspicuous support was given to the Turkish cause by the Iranian press. 219. The agreements concluded by M. Husnu covered a wide variety of subjects without embodying very concrete results. The commercial treaty amounted to little more than a mutual agreement for most-favoured-nation treatment, and the Iranian Government, wisely no doubt in view of their exchange difficulties, would not comply with the Turkish wish for a clearing agreement. A Convention on Communications provided for connecting the railway systems of49 s - the two countries, and pending this for improvement of the road transport facilities between Trebizdnd and Tabriz. There was evidence that turkey was proceeding to link up from Diarbekir via Bitlis and Van, but no practical action could be expected from the Iranian side until the Trans-Iranian Railway was finished and provided with rolling-stock; nor did Iran make much eftort to improve commercial facilities by road. An air service convention proved to be little more than an agreement to agree, and attempts to negotiate a consular convention failed, M. Husnu finding it as impossible as His Majesty s Govern ment in the United Kingdom to induce the Iranian Government to agree to the inclusion of their whole country in consular districts. 220. Two conventions on extradition and frontier security were of some interest; the former mainly from the fact of its conclusion. The latter laid down a zone extending 50 kilom. on each side of the frontier m which major and minor officials were specified to deal with frontier incidents. The officials were to meet regularly, and had powers to visit any locality m the zone for the purpose ot collecting evidencce, and to fix the scale of indemnities M. Husnu s agreements were ratified by the Majlis on the 5th June and by the Grand National Assembly two days later. The United States. 221. Although the Iranian Legation and consulates in the United States remained closed throughout the year, and there seemed no immediate prospect of their being reopened, 1937 marked an improvement in relations between the two countries There was no further anti-American campaign m the Tehran press; contrary to what Mr. Engert, the new Charge d’Affaires, had been led to expect Iranians attended his celebration of Independence Day m gratifying force, and the restrictions on the entry of American newspapers and other publications (including official ones) into Iran were mainly, if not entirely, removed, lo achieve this last Mr. Engert made strong representations as to the illegality ot the Iranian Government’s action in holding up these papers, pointing out that this might involve them in a not inconsiderable claim for compensation. I he Shah visited the American Archaeological Mission at Persepolis in the spring and in contrast to the pin-pricks of 1936, the head, Dr. Schmidt, received permission to make several survey flights in various parts of Northern Iran, which he duly carried out. 222. The main event of the year, however, was the passage by the Majlis in January of a Bill granting two concessions, one for exploitation of petroleum m the north-eastern provinces of Iran to an American company to be known as the Amiranian Oil Company, and the other for the construction of a pipe-lme to a separate company to be called the Iranian Pipe-Line Company of the Lmtec States of America These concessions were negotiated on behalf of the American companies by Mr. Hart, a previous United States Minister m Tehran, and Mr F. G. Clapp. Each concession was for sixty years, and no immediate cash payment was provided for. 223. The limit of the Amiranian Oil Company’s area ran from the Caspian to the frontier of British Baluchistan through Bandar Shah, Damgan, Behabad and Irafshan The company was bound within three years of ratification to choose two provinces in East and North-East Iran, and within fifteen years to select within these two provinces an area or areas of not more than 100,000 square miles Exploration was required to begin within six months and boring within eighteen months of ratification. The company was given exclusive right of extraction of petrol in the area of the concession. In lieu of taxation the company would pay 9c? on every metric ton of oil sold in Iran or exported. The Iranian Government would receive {a) 4s. per metric ton on petroleum sold m Iran or exported- and (b) a sum equal to 20 per cent', of the sum distributed to ordinary shareholders after the deduction of a sum equal to 5 per cent, of the capital invested by the company in Iran. Further, a minimum payment of £300 000 per annum was guaranteed to the Iranian Government from the end of the fifth year after the concession, rising to £600,000 at the end of the fourteenth year. 224 The Pipe-Line Company’s concession gave it a right (not exclusive) to construct a main pipe-line in any part of Iran provided the rights of other companies were respected, and tributary lines to connect the main lines with othermm 50 lines in Iran or neighbouring countries. The company’s lines might carry petroleum from wells in Iran or Afghanistan, which might belong either to the company itself or to the Amiranian Company, or to other companies, whether Iranian or foreign, entitled to extract oil in Iran, such companies being known as “ the public.” The company undertook to transport petroleum belonging to the public or to the Iranian Government up to 40 per cent, of the total capacity of the lines. Plans for the construction of the line were required to be put in hand as soon as the results of exploration for oil in the areas which the line was to serve justified the expense. The company was exempt from taxation for thirty years, and in return would pay the Iranian Government 3d. on every metric ton of petroleum carried. The pipe-line was expected to be carried to the sea in the neighbourhood of Charbar. 225. These two concessions were complemented by a third concession granted by the Afghan Government in April to Messrs. Hart and Clapp on behalf of the Inland Exploration Company. In a great many particulars the three concessions were copied from the revised concession of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. 226. Prospecting work was first carried out north-west of Meshed near the Caspian littoral, and without much result. Further search was made elsewhere in the northern part of the company’s area, and during the closing winter months prospectors were expected in Seistan and near Zahidan. If oil is found in remunerative quantities, it seems likely that Zahidan will become an important place for the company. The results achieved by the end of the year were at any rate sufficient to lead the company to order drilling machinery, which was expected to arrive at Bandar Shahpur in March 1938. The transport of the heavy machinery to remote parts of North-East Iran is likely to prove a very difficult problem. Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. 227. There is little to record of Irano-Soviet relations during 1937; they continued calm, but Iranian authorities in Tehran, Tabriz and Meshed all were given reason to feel irritation at obstruction imposed by the Soviet authorities in the way of the movement of certain individual consignments of goods to and from Iran. 228. The major event was no doubt the concessions awarded by the Iranian Government to two United States companies to prospect for pipe oil in certain provinces, including those in North-East Iran which adjoin Soviet Russia. The Soviet Government did, in fact, submit a protest in this connexion, based not on article 13 of the Irano-Soviet Treaty of 1935, or because American companies had been preferred, but on the ground that the existing good-neighbourly relations between the two countries and the benefits conferred on Iran by the Soviet Government entitled them at least to be informed in advance of concessions which, if granted to certain other countries, might have been of serious concern to them, and on the ground that they had received no advance intimation of the Iranian Government’s intention. 229. Opinion in the Diplomatic Body at Tehran was inclined to suggest that the Soviet Government were sore at the conclusion of the Four-Power Non- Aggression Pact which involved three of their neighbours. The Soviet Ambas sador, however, professed to regard the Pact as of some utility in consolidating peace in the territories concerned. 230. Broadly speaking Soviet consulates in Iran were subject to the same boycott as those of His Majesty’s Government, and on more than one occasion an illiberal attitude towards requests from His Majesty’s Legation was explained on the familiar ground that otherwise the Soviet Government would put forward a similar request and expect it to be granted. 231. The Soviet Union continued to obtain a large share of Iran’s foreign trade. On the 16th and 19th October a protocol and accord were signed which are presumed to govern the volume and prices of imports and exports between the Soviet Union and Iran during the year ending the 21st June, 1938, in accordance with the existing Irano-Soviet Commercial Treaty, which will expire on that date. The text of these agreements has not been published and no figures are ava lable. It is presumed that new arrangements for the barter trade between the two countries will be negotiated in the summer of 1938.51 Yugoslavia. 232. In October M. S. Spasojevitch arrived in Tehran and assumed the duties of Charge d’Aflaires. This is Yugoslavia’s first representation in this coinitry, her interests having hitherto been looked after by the French Legation. These interests now seem to be principally in securing the exit from Iran of Yugoslavs employed on the railway with as much of the money due to them in foreign currency as possible. (D) International. Middle-Eastern Pact of Non-Aggression. 233. It had long been contemplated that, as soon as the Irano-Iraqi dispute over their frontier should be settled, the Four-Power Pact of Non-Aggression, initialled at Geneva in October 1935, between Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan, should be concluded. 234. In April the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs disclaimed that his prospective visit to Bagdad and Tehran in June would be connected with either of the above questions. By June, however, it was pretty clear that both treaties would be ripe for signature in Tehran in the following month, and shortly alter the arrival of Dr. Aras in Tehran at the end of June, the Afghan Foreign Minister was urgently invited to come to Tehran to sign the pact. Faiz Muhammad arrived early in July, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs having preceded him by a few days, and the pact was signed at the Shah s summer palace at Saadabad on the 8th July. It was agreed that the treaty should hereafter be known as the Pact of Saadabad. 235. The pact was signed as identical with that initialled at Geneva. It provided for mutual non-interference, non-aggression, and consultation; also foi reference in certain circumstances to the Council of the League of Nations, and for the settlement of disputes between themselves by pacific means alone. The pact was concluded for a definite period of five years, and further, in default of denunciation by one of the contracting parties. 236. On the day of signature a joint communique emphasising the identity of views between the four parties was issued. A further communique, issued on the 13th July, announced that representatives of the four parties, who styled themselves the Council of the Eastern Entente, would meet not less than once a year, and that a secretariat would be established at Tehran, the intention being that'this should consist of a high official of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and members of the diplomatic missions at Tehran of the other parties. The first fruits of this co-operation were to be a joint support for Iran’s candidature for the seat on the Council of the League of Nations, due to be vacated by Turkey, after which an alphabetical roster was to be established among the parties, and there was to be joint support for a semi-permanent seat for Turkey. Iran was duly elected by the Assembly in September, but the new Entente's support of Turkey was unsuccessful. The communique closed with a friendly message to neighbouring and allied Powers. 237. Opinion in the Diplomatic Body at Tehran seemed to be that the conclusion of this pact was a restraint on Italy oiganised by His Majesty s Government in the United Kdngdom through the agency of the Turkish Government. By the end of the year the pact had been latified by none of the contracting parties.53 mr&amp; III.—Internal Situation. General Comments. 239. Every year’s events go to prove that the Government is the Shah. there is scarcely any opportunity for direct observation of fj 118 . all-impor an - personage, except when he goes on tour. In March he toured Khuzistan, Bus ire, Shiraz and Isfahan, ancl, as usual, his calculated changes of demeanour corresponded with views, with which he was already primed, of the local si ua ion. At Ahwaz he was in a genial humour directly related to the favour enjoye y General Mu’iny, the military commander, and, though he criticised the navy and the Customs, he praised the army and the railway. At Shiraz on the contrary, he was in an evil humour, and markedly ignored both persons and things o w ic he might reasonably have been expected to attend. The reason is not so clear, but the silence of his reception at Bushire, and reports that certain citizens intended to petition him with complaints against the Governments, i.e. ms, economic policy, may have combined to put him out of temper; or it may nave been a foretaste of^his intentions towards the Governor-General and military commander, who were later in the year dismissed with great ignominy, tor ttieir conspicuously corrupt practices. 240. There is no foretelling what the autocrat will do. At Bushire the populace had been so dragooned by the authorities about what they were tor bid den to do during the Royal visit, that few turned out to receive him. On learning the reason, he ordered that the people should be allowed to come outa nd greet their ruler. Yet when he passed on to Shiraz, he drove past the assembled crowd at high speed, and apparently paid no attention to them for the whole ot his stay Secondly, no foreign residents or officials were anywhere asked to appear except at Ahwaz, where the general manager and a senior member of the Anglo-Iraman Oil Comp an v, and the manager of the Imperial Bank of Iran, were invited, given places of honour, and singled out for his conversation; but he went near none ot the oil company’s areas. Thirdly, the incidence of the mourning month ot Muharram was given as a reason for suppressing many triumphal arches that had been planned, and in some cases erected: he avoided being in Ahwaz on his birthday, and held only a small reception at No t ot ^, of n wl \ lc ^ occuri p ed during the tour. But he chose the 10th Muharram, the Shiah s Good Friday, for his departure from Khuzistan. He may have been turning anything to account to impress the lesson that business comes before feasting or mourning Or he may have wished to prevent Royal visits from inflicting useless expenditure on the townspeople; if so, this was unfortunately robbed of its purpose by the fact that the local officials had already made their exactions before the orders were given. 241 The Valiahd accompanied him, but though his father was seen to draw his attention to many points of interest, no opportunity was given to the people of really seeing their future ruler, nor was he allowed to make any new contacts Indeed the Crown Prince is in general kept from forming any associations that might become political, and evidence is lacking of his initiation into any weighty affairs of state. But the life of the Palace is too hidden from outside gaze for conclusion to be formed. 242 The two princesses (see paragraph 250 of the annual report for 1936) were married to the elder son of the Prime Minister, M. Jam, and the elder son of Qawam-el-Mulk, respectively. 243 In Mav His Imperial Majesty visited his estates in Mazanderan, and in November he attended the Turcoman races It has been noticed that these visits to Mazanderan are apt to coincide with sharp bouts of secret police activity. Towards the end of May there were rumours of many arrests and some executions. There appear to have been two affairs : one an army plot to take the Shah s life, for which four officers are said to have been executed; the other a student move ment alleged to be of a type too self-assertive to be tolerated by a police State, and connected with a technical school until recently under a German head. No officia mention of these was allowed to transpire. At about the same period a prominent landowner owning a valuable library and properties m Khorassan and close to the Shah’s'summer palace, disappeared into confinement. 1 /244. The Shah’s treatment of his own Ministers and officials continued to be arbitrary : most notably, General Jehenbani, an outstanding Staff Officer of Kajar descent, who was appointed Director-General of the Department of Industry in March 1936, was suddenly dismissed in August, and forbidden to wear military uniform. His successor, an official of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, was dismissed after a few weeks as summarily. 245. The morbid Iranian sentitiveness to the most insignificant remarks in the foreign press, that is primarily a trait of the Shah’s character (see intro duction paragraph 126 of this report and paragraph 264 of the annual report tor 1936), continued unabated. During 1937 the British press took its turn m the pillory. What seems to cause the most acute reaction is any reference, even laudatory in intent, to Reza’s humble origin. Nor is this exclusively a sore spot of the present monarch. The tradition of monarchy in Persia has from the earliest recorded times been one of an almost divinely revered being, addressed only in terms of fulsome adulation (as testified by the court vocabulary, the native chronicles and the accents of the contemporary Iranian press), and difficult of approach. It is in marked contrast with the Arab conception of kingship, and should be taken into account in estimating the manner in which the Shah insists upon his legend and is able to ride rough-shod over opposition. 246. An impdrtant occurrence was the death on the 10th February of the Minister of Finance, M. Davar. Officially he died of heart failure, but he is known to have had a sharp interview with the Shah the night before, and he was found dead next morning, having taken heavy doses of opium that indicate suicide. One way or another, he was driven to death by a task-master who insisted on an ever-increasing supply of funds to finance a programme that the resources of the country are, by all sober estimates, insufficient to meet at the pace demanded. 247. Finance and economics overshadow all the present history of Iran; and the hard-working Davar had taken so much on to his own personal shoulders of the gigantic and growing burden of the whole experiment represented by the railway, the factories, the monopoly companies and the control of trade and exchange, that his sudden removal was expected to give the machine such a jolt that a relaxation of policy was inevitable. It is characteristic of Iran that recognition of the work and ability of a very single-minded public servant was swamped by positive joy at the death of one whom popular imagination identified with the exactions of the relentless policy that was not improbably forced on M. Davar by the Shah. The fact that his removal did not, during 1937, result in any net relaxation of policy, either in the limitation of the railway programme (an extension to Tabriz was discussed), the abandonment of more than one or two monopolies, anything but minor concessions in the control of trade and exchange, or, it follows, any relief of taxation, means that the Shah’s driving force is as steady as ever. 248. In fact, the web of Government control over the national life was actually extended. An Imperial Economic Council was set up in April, and later the two Departments of Commerce and of Industry and Mines were raised to Ministries, at the same time as M. Davar’s successor, M. Mahmoud Bader, was confirmed in his rank. M. Davar’s economic task was put into commission. More began to be heard of projects to exploit mineral wealth, and towards the end of the year agriculture was drawn deeper into the official ambit. Legislation was passed providing for complete reorganisation of the administrative geography and personnel of the whole land ; the old provinces are to be carved up into departments, divided and sub-divided, in the true Napoleonic manner. It bore signs of hasty drafting and lack of preparation, and had not taken effect at the end of the year, but it included important agricultural duties for the new provincial officials, and, in addition, a further law was enacted, dealing solely with agricultural development, and providing for putting into commission, under official auspices, the management of any private estate deemed unproductive. The Shah’s programme is as ambitious as ever, and not to be affected by the comings and goings of Ministers. 249. Nevertheless, though the machine went on expanding, the movement of its wheels showed signs of slowing down. Indecisions increased; there were muddles in the monopolies; goods lay congested in customs; assessments of taxation became wilder and more arbitrary, expedients for meeting the demand for foreign55 exchange more desperate; a transfer (or perhaps a deposit) of the Royal gold hoard, and a sale of Crown jewels, in favour of the National Bank’s “ reserves was announced in October, and others were invited—with what success it is not known—to follow this high example. Forcing the pace of an attempted national transformation entails these natural consequences, but the removal of M. Davar i®* was a palpable factor. He was generally only allowed to decide one way, but he did possess the quality, rare in his countrymen, of decision. 250. The social result of all this was a remarkable rise in the cost of living. Apart from its direct effect upon the general welfare, this had undesirable by products. Red tape, over-centralisation, congestion of business combined with the higher cost of clothing their families in western dress tend to intensify both the opportunities and the incentive for corruption, particularly among the smaller officials. This does not always go unpunished; at the end of the summer the Governor-fieneral, General Officer Commanding and a number of higher officials of Ears were dismissed for wholesale peculation, unfortunately such dismissals, though salutary, do not uproot the disease lower down in the organism, where the common people feel it most. 251. Next to their daily bread, what affects the people most widely is what touches the code of social habit that, in Islam, is endorsed by religion. Among Moslems the Iranians are not a fanatical people. The unveiling of women inaugurated in the preceding year attacks the people’s social conservatism as much as their religious prejudice. Above all, like conscription, it symbolises the steady penetration into their daily lives of an influence that brings with it more outside interference, more taxation. But one can easily exaggerate the popular effect of unveiling; it is a revolution for the well-to-do of the towns, but lower down the scale, where women perform outdoor manual labour, its effects both on habit and on the family budget diminish until among the tribal folk of all degrees they are comparatively slight. Hence resistance among the greater part of the people has been passive, and, where existing, has manifested itself in reluctance of the older generation to go abroad in the streets. It is one thing to forbid women to veil; it is another thing to make them mingle freely with men. The seventeenth day of the Iranian calendar, corresponding to the 7th or 8th January, is now celebrated as the anniversary of the emancipation of women (see para graph 242 of the annual report for 1936. Constant press publicity is given to the “Foyer feminin,” and the papers display pictures of the Queen and Princesses attending public functions. The reform, when it is consolidated by the passing of the older generation, should ultimately be of great benefit to the country. 252. In spite of the unfanatical nature of Iranians, the Shiah faith has one or two rough edges. The shrine at Meshed is open, by arrangement witn the police, to non-Moslem visitors, and officials display up-to-dateness by encouraging this. The Muharram ceremonies have for some years past been increasingly restricted. This year public approbation by speakers at a religious meeting of the Caliphs Abu Bakr, Omar and Othman, whom it is the pious duty of Shiahs to curse, was reported from Zahidan. The instance was isolated, but it would have been unthinkable in any Shiah community in this country only a few years ago. 253. Westernisation, however, does not prevail where it is traversed by nationalism. Early in the year the Shah ordered brusquely that all public signs and writings in the streets should be in the Persian language and character only, and the order was everywhere carried out with fair strictness. This was followed in the summer by a law stringently regulating the use of all but Persian woids and writin 0, in names of firms, trade marks, &amp;c., even on \isitmg cards, and providing that all internal correspondence, accounts and business documents must be kept in Persian. The potential effect of this law on such concerns as the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company and the Imperial Bank of Iran is obvious. Up to the end of the year the firms in question had been able, by private and independent nego tiations to arrange that nothing revolutionary to their staff arrangements need be done,’ and no cases of difficulty from other British firms had been reported, but it is possible that strict application may cause difficulties in the future. 254 Throughout the year an “academy” known as the “ Farhangistan ' maintained a steady, though not rapid, output of new-fangled or revived words of pure or allegedly pure, Persian origin, to displace words of foreign, and inmost cases Arabic, extraction. These terms, approved and published by the Ministry of Justice in its Gazette, pass into official correspondence, though tew ot them have as yet had time to flavour the conversation of any but the most zealous. 255 It cannot be concluded that Iran has turned her back on the idea of going over to the Latin character; it may be that everything will be fused into a common crucible before being all poured into another mould. But this may well not occur in the lifetime of the present Shah, who, having labonously learnt one system of writing, would probably dislike learning another. 256. Thus far the picture of internal affairs has been mainly gloomy. An even gloomier subject is the possibility of food shortage when taken into conjunction with the muddles of the grain stabilisation monopoly, the encouragement of non-edible crops such as cotton in place of gram, and the tendency to balance payments with the U.S.S.R. by exporting live-stock. \et there is a brighter side. Education has undoubtedly continued to icceive advancement, and after-work classes for abolishing illiteracy appear to be growing. Hygiene, though behindhand in practice, is constantly preached m the press and'elsewhere. The opening of a sanatorium at Shahabad, near Tehran was accorded a great flourish. Even the policy manifested during the yeai o further restricting the practice of foreign doctors, though the aim is not scientific but nationalistic, and the effect is to reduce the sound medical attention available to the public, may ultimately mean better Iranian doctors, factory legislation of a rudimentary kind, in connexion with the new industrialisation, has come into being; though it remains at present a piece of facade, except for the provisions forbidding strikes or combinations of workmen. 257. It remains to consider the effect of the general coercive policy of the Shah's Government upon the most conservative and intractable elements, namely, the tribes The operations against recalcitrant tribesmen are described elsewhere in paragraphs 277-280 below. Here it may be said that there were no important tribal upheavals in 1937. To such as there were, various of the fol owing very normal causes may be assigned : the chiefs’ fears of losing their hold to govern- ment; the rank and file’s dislike of disturbances of their traditional habits by westernising reforms and efforts to turn them into settlers on parts of the land that in the nature of things, was hitherto beyond the margin of settlement ; the increasing penetration of the tax-gathers; the conscription officers, the high hand of the military governor behind them; the lack of a properly trained civil service to take over the areas brought under direct administration; and the rising cost of such commodities as the tribesman buys. Settlement, the inevitable policy of a modernising State, need not be the end of resistance, which is liable to continue until the feudal and family organisation is dissolved; but it is the first step towards control. Unfortunately it has one serious potential consequence in a land so dry as Iran; on restricted pastures the breed of the flocks may be expected to degenerate in time, and with it the quality and quantity of the wool that has been the foundation of tribal wealth and of the Persian carpet industry. 258. In a manner similar to that of the incident reported at the end of paragraph 242 of the annual report for 1936, another tribal migration to Indian Mekran from Mahu and Dashtiari in the Charbar district was reported. The reason appears to have been the increasing penetration of the Government, and the Procrustean manner of their enforcement of changes; in this instance the Government seem to have been working through the local Sardars. Some at least of the party returned to Iran later, but the influx of emigrants from Iranian Baluchistan and Mekran continued to cause anxiety to the Government of India. The Majlis. 259. The Tenth Majlis was dissolved on the 12th June, and the Eleventh was opened by the Shah with full ceremony on the 11th September. M. Hassan Esfandiary, president of the Tenth Majlis, was re-elected. This assembly is now hardly even a talking house. It is nothing new that its elections should be ringed; but it now passes, almost without discussion, highly important legislation that in a real Parliament would, quite apart from debate, occasion long committee stages, as, for instance, the law reorganising the provinces; and a few weeks later it will equally perfunctorily pass radical amendments placed before it. It is just the Shah and Cabinet’s rubber stamp.57 The Sheikh of Mohammerah. 260. It is impracticable for members of the late sheikh’s family to be in touch with any British authority in Iran, and no information is available ot any settlement of the family affairs in this country. Most of the twenty-eigh heirs, among whom there is continual dissension, have gathered m Basra, and appear for the time being to have centred their interests in Iraq, it may be noted that a commission for distribution to peasants of Crown lands in Khuzistan was formed during April, and that some of the lands inspected by the commission were properties of the late sheikh. It is likely that the Iranian Government consider them to be Crown lands, though no definite information is available on this point, for up to the end of the year no distribution that would give such an indication had been reported. Civil Aviation. 261 At the end of November a beginning was at last made with the Iranian air mail service, the machines for which had arrived in June 1936. On the 30th November a weekly service to Kermanshah was inaugurated, the aeroplane leaving Tehran each Tuesday and returning the same afternoon. 1 he machines used lere De Havilland “ Rapides ” and the the Iranian air force. No passengers were carried. It was stated that the service would shortly be extended to Bagdad, but this had not been done by the end ot the year. IV.— Military Affairs. The Army. General. 262. During 1937 the strength of the Iranian army has increased by nearly 9 000 men. The budget shows an increase of £500,000. About £2 million worth of war material has been purchased. The Government troops if they have achieved no permanent settlement of the disturbed areas of Baluchistan or Kurdistan, have, at any rate, suffered no humiliating defeats. Conscription is working smoothly, and is being extended gradually into the more remote tribal areas. The recall of conscripts to the colours for reservist training has begun. The army has received its pay and its rations and is content, as well it might be, with its unique position under the present regime. Among some rather lean kme the soldiers alone appear to be fat. Expenditure. 263. In the estimates for the Iranian year 1316 (21st March, 1937, to the 20th March, 1938), the credit provided for the Ministry of War is 283,729,980 rials or about £3,546,625 at present rates. This sum includes provision for the navy and air force, for which no separate heads are shown. It represents an increase of 40 million rials (£500,000), over last year s figures. 400,000 rials (£5 000) has been provided for expenses in connection with conscription, and 25 678 400 rials (£320,980) for the gendarmerie. This gives a total budgeted military expenditure of 309,808,380 rials (£3,872,604) or, approximately 25 per cent, of the total budgeted expenditure of the country An additional sum ot £79 829 was voted out of reserves for the Iranian navy for the construction ot a slipway at Bandar Pahlavi. As far as is known, no other sums have been voted for military expenditure, and the extra grant of £2 million which was voted from the Government’s holdings abroad in 1933, 1934, 1935 and 1936, and which had come to be regarded almost as an annual feature, is conspicuously absent from this year’s budget. Strength. 264 The strength of the Iranian army, as estimated on the 1st June, 1937 was 105A51 all ranks. This figure shows an increase of 8,989 over the estimated strength of 1936. As long ago as 1933 it was stated (annual report, para graph 614) that the Shah aimed at an army 100,000 strong. This object he appears to have achieved.58. Organisation. 265. No important changes in organisation have been made during the past year. Except for the disappearance of the Turkoman Sahra Independent Composite Regiment, the present organisation is the same as that given in para graph 270 of last year’s annual report. 266. In July a rumour was current in Tabriz that the local General Officer Commanding was to proceed to Tehran to raise a third division of the Central Garrison. Up to the close of the year, however, nothing more had been heard of this scheme. A rmament. 267. War material of all kinds has been pouring into the country, and in July it was estimated that 10,000 tons of miscellaneous military stores had accumulated at rail-head at Salihabad awaiting transport by lorry to Tehran. Further consignments of an order placed for tanks and tank-carrying lorries are known to have arrived, and the rate at which re-equipment is progressing may be judged from the fact that in the past nine months more than thirty batteries of 105 millim. guns have been received. Changes in the Higher Appointments. 268. In December it was rumoured that Sar Lashgar Ismail Agha, Amir Fazli, had been dismissed from his post as Minister of War. The rumour has turned out to be true. There are two versions current of the story of his fall. According to the first, the Shah, on one of his visits to the Ministry, was annoyed at Ismail Agha’s ignorance of some matter under discussion, and curtly told him that he was a fool and had better go home. According to the second version, the Shah paid a surprise visit to the Ministry and found the officers chatting, smoking and drinking tea and the Minister absent from his desk. When Ismail Agha arrived the Shah felled him to the ground and continued to thrash him with his cane. It is not known which version is correct, but the second appears to be more in the Reza tradition. Up to the end of the year no successor had been appointed. Sartip Ahmad Nakhchevan, who, after his return from Europe in October, had been appointed assistant to the Minister of War, has been officiating as Minister. 269. Sartip Ibrahim Zandieh, the General Officer Commanding, 7th Fars Division, was recalled from Shiraz in August and placed under arrest in Tehran. He is implicated in the widespread corruption which was revealed in almost all the branches of the administration of Fars. His successor is Sartip Muhammad Hussain Amidi. Reviews and Parades. 270. The usual military review to commemorate the anniversary of the coup d’Etat took place on the Jalaliye parade ground on the 23rd. Counting the civilian elements (girl guides, boy scouts and students), approximately 30,000 people were on parade. Fifty-two aeroplanes (De Havilland “ Tiger-Moth ” and Hawker “ Audax ” and “Fury” in almost equal proportions) flew past in formation. Thirty-nine light and eleven heavy tanks were seen on parade. The parade followed the line of last year’s, but showed some improvement in drill, turn out and equipment. Manoeuvres. 271. Manoeuvres for the' Central Garrison was held from the 12th to the 16th September, about 35 miles east of Tehran. His Imperial Majesty the Shah was present for three days. Aircraft participated. No invitations to military attaches were issued. No accounts were published in the press. As on previous occasions, nearly all the available taxis and lorries were commandeered for about a week. 272. Some manoeuvres for the Ahwaz Brigade of the 6th Khuzistan Division, held near Dizful in April, are worthy of mention because of the interest they aroused in Iraq, where rumours spread to the effect that 24,000 Iranian troops were concentrated in Ahwaz, Khurramshahr and Hawizeh.59 Conscription. 273. Conscription has been working smoothly and the quotas have been coming in. Further extensions among certain sections of the Kurds and Qashgais have been made. A start has been made with the calling up of reservists for training, and those born in the Persian year 1284 and called up for service in 1304 will be called up in 1317 for their first reserve training which should have taken place in 1310. To make the position more clear it may be explained that a man s twenty-five years’ liability for military service (which starts in his 21st year) is divided into four periods as follows:— (i) Two years’ colour service. (ii) Four years in the first reserve (“ Ihtiyat ’), during which he carries out one month’s training in the fourth year. (iii) Thirteen years in the second reserve ( £&lt; Zakhireh-i-Muqaddam ”), during which he undergoes one month’s training every two years. (iv) Six years in the third reserve (“ Zakhireh-i-Tali ”), during which he undergoes one month’s training every three years. Military Operations. 274. Kurdistan and Baluchistan. —From what has been written about Kurdistan and Baluchistan in the annual reports of the past four years it could hardly be expected that the Iranian Government would enjoy a trouble-free year in either of these areas in 1937. They have not done so, and both these provinces are in an unsettled state and are likely to remain so as long as certain conditions continue. 275. These conditions are :— (i) The existence of a migratory tribal population which, either seasonally as nomads, or from expediency as bandits, can move across the frontier from the territory of one State to that of another (ii) The lack of complete understanding and co-operation with the power on the other side of the frontier. (iii) The possession of arms by that population. (iv) A military occupation which is not sufficiently complete to serve as the foundation on which to build up a civil administration, but which from its incompleteness, its lack of policy and the high-handed behaviour of the soldiery is merely provocative among the tribes of reprisals it is powerless to prevent. 276. However, in justice to the Iranians it must be said that in neither Baluchistan nor Kurdistan have any actions worthy of the name of operations been called for though the troops have remained under field-service conditions. In Baluchistan the food blockade against the Ismailzais proved ineffective and was dropped, and for the next six months the Government tried by alternate cajolery and threats to create dissension among the Baluchis and alienate from their sympathies their strongest opponents—the Ismailzais. What success attended this effort it is difficult to gauge. Towards the close of the year it was reported that the Government was secretly preparing an offensive against this tribe. Up to the close of the year no military action had been taken, though some troop movements which seemed more precautionary than seasonal had taken place. In Kurdistan the picture is even more blurred and all 1937 can show is a pitiful record of petty skirmishes with the tribes and occasional clashes with the Iraqi frontier patrols. 277 The Khamseh Tribes. —In September unrest among these tribes near Lar was reported and a battalion was sent from Shiraz to quell the disturbances. The affair could not have assumed large proportions, for the threat of military action proved sufficient and the battalion was withdrawn to Shiraz by November. 278 The Arab Tribes of Khuzistan. —Isolated acts of banditry were reported from this area in July, but no military action to deal with them was taken. Bather surprisingly this inertia did not lead to further and more extended acts, but was followed by migration of several families into Iraq. 279 The Bahmai. —In May trouble came from a new and unexpected quarter A section of the Bahmai division of the Kuhgilu tribe revolted and a force of 800 men was despatched as reinforcements to Sarhang Saqafi, the MilitaryGovernor of Behbehan and Kuhgilu. In June it was reported that one sub-section of the Bahmai had made submission to Government and that the other, numbering some 200, had taken to the mountains. In July this recalcitrant sub-section was reported to have been joined by 150 Bakhtiari malcontents and to have taken refuge in the difficult terrain of the Kuh-i-Mungasht, some 40 miles east of Haft Khel oilfield. The military were in pursuit. In September this band attacked a military post at Qaleh Ala and inflicted casualties on officers and other ranks of the Iranian Government forces. Among those killed was Sarhang Saqafi, the Military Governor referred to above. Reinforcements to the number of 3,000 were despatched at once in commandeered motor transport from Ahwaz, Dizful, Shushtar and Khurramabad to this area and 1,500 from Shiraz to Ardakan and the Zarghun Plain, where, it was reported, the Boir Ahmadi (a western division of the Kuhgilu) were also disaffected. 280. Casualties were suffered by both forces. In the Shiraz column it was rumoured that thirty-four officers and 2,000 other ranks had been killed, but a subsequent estimate reduced this fantastic figure to 600, which, in the light of the very little fighting done, still seems unbelievably high. In the Behbehan column the casualties from the enemy and from sickness (chiefly dysentery) probably amounted to 400. By the close of the year most of the Shiraz column had returned to headquarters, while in Behbehan operations were stationary, the local com mander having resigned himself to containing the rebels on the Kuh-i-Mungasht till the rigours of winter and a shortage of supplies forced them to submit. The rebel leader appears to have taken active steps to prevent this by organising a striking force of 400 riflemen for the purpose of making replenishment raids on caravans and vulnerable villages in the neighbourhood. As the year closed it was reported that His Imperial Majesty the Shah was growing impatient at the cost of the operations prolonged from month to month without any visible success, and that he had urged the General Officer Commanding 6th Division to take more vigorous action to finish the campaign. The French Military Mission. 281. This mission now consists of twelve members. As far as is known, it continues to work in harmony with the Ministry of War. Some resentment is felt by the members of the mission at the curtailment of their social contacts with foreigners and with Legations other than their own. They say that they had heard of these restrictions before their engagement and had made it a condition of their acceptance of the contract that no such restrictions should be imposed in their case. The Ministry of War, they affirm, agreed to this, but subsequently told General Gendre that the Shah did not approve of free intercourse between his advisers and foreign Legations. They consider that General Gendre was very weak to give way over this, and their resentment is all the more because of the greater freedom allowed to the head of the mission in these things. The general and some of the members went on a tour to East Iran and the Persian Gulf in October. This was in the nature of a pleasure trip, and it is not thought that the duties of the mission are anything else than professorial or that they have any executive responsibility, or have been asked to advise the Ministry on the subject of frontier or coastal defence. Military Works. 282. No works of major importance have been carried out, but the con tinuation of the policy of construction of new barracks in every garrison town in the country must have accounted for a large part of the army budget. Consider able work on communications in South-East Iran has been done, and the area, resembling a parallelogram, enclosed by the four towns of Bam, Bampur, Dizak and Zahidan (with a southerly branch to the port of Chahbar) has been covered with a veritable network of military roads. Liaison with Foreign A rmies. 283. Four officers of the Iraq army spent a week in Tehran in February as the guests of the Iranian Government. During their stay they witnessed the annual military review on the 16th anniversary of the coup d'FAat. A party of Iranian officers attended the Turkish army manoeuvres in Thrace. The Turkish military attache in Tehran accompanied the party.\ v ? • \ &gt; 61 Colleagues. 284. Japanese .—Of Commandant Fukuti little is seen and of his activities here little is known. He has a slight knowledge of Russian, but speaks no other foreign language. In October he paid a surprise visit to Kabul soon aitei the Japanese military attache at that post had been recalled at the request ot the Afghan Government. On arrival at Kabul he was informed that his presence was unwelcome and, after a stay of three weeks, he returned to Tehran. 285. French .—Commandant Robert Leleu proceeded on short leave during the summer. He continues to be a friendly, helpful and loyal colleague. 286. Italian .—Capitaine de Fregate Luciano Biji went on short leave in the autumn. He stated that his wife was returning to Italy, and that he was to accompany her as far as Haifa and then after pay a short sight-seeing visit to Cairo. Some time after his departure it was learnt that he would not return. He himself had frequently said that in Tehran he found himself too far away from his element, that there was little for him to do, and that he feared that a long stay m Iran would adversely affect his advancement in his own service. 287. Turkish .—Capitaine d’Ftat-Major Jelal Orge is still in Tehran, and remains a friendly and helpful colleague. While, naturally, elated at the special position he enjoys, he does not crow over his success and is always ready to impart any information he may have acquired. 288. Russian .—Colonel Absalamoff was suddenly summoned to Moscow last August and has not yet returned. Towards the end of the year a rumour became current that he had been shot along with the other numerous victims of the late “ pur°’e.” This rumour must have reached the ears of the Soviet Embassy, for the Charge d’Affaires took it upon himself to inform the military attache that his late colleague was in excellent health, enjoying a holiday at some well-known winter resort on the Black Sea, and that he had been asked in a letter to convey Colonel Absalamoff’s kind regards. Subsequently, he volunteered the information that Colonel Absalamoff was now in Moscow. 289. German. —Lieutenant-Colonel Hans Rohde, stationed at Angora and accredited also to Tehran, paid a short visit of three or foui days to Tehran in December. The visit came more or less as a surprise and, perhaps, because of this it was rumoured that the colonel had come post-haste and unannounced to put through a deal in German military aircraft with the Iranian Government. The Iranian Air Force. Strength in Machines. 290. There has been no increase in the strength of the Iranian air force during the past year, so that the total number of aeroplanes remains at 154. The description of these machines is as follows :— Aircraft. De Havilland “ Tiger-Moth ” .... De Havilland “ Tiger-Moth ” .... De Havilland 9 (Russian built).... Hawker “ Audax ” Hawker “ Audax ” Hawker “Fury” .... Junkers (Type W. 33) • Russian R. 5 (Type M. 17)(rebuilt) Engine.

Casualties. 293. Many accidents have occurred during the year under review resulting in six machines (five “ Tiger-Moth ” and one “ Audax ”) being written off. New Orders. 294. The order placed in 1936 with the De Havilland Aircraft Company (Limited) for five additional machines of the “ Rapide ” type has been cancelled by the Iranian Government. The reason is unknown. An order has been placed with the Hawker Aircraft Company (Limited) for thirty-five aeroplanes of the “ Hind ” type and twenty-five Gloster “ Gladiator ” type. It is understood that the majority of these machines will be delivered during 1938. 295. It is rumoured that the Iranian Government have ordered from Germany twelve bomber aeroplanes (Type J.U. 86 K). Twenty officers and men of the Iranian air force are said to have been selected to proceed to Germany to undergo instruction in this machine. Demonstrations by a machine of this type were given in the presence of His Imperial Majesty The Shah during October.x 63 Factories. 296. The personnel employed at the Iranian aircraft factory at Doshanteppeh is as follows :— British adviser. British mechanics (Hawker): 9. British mechanics (De Havilland): 2. British mechanics (Bristol): 2. Iranian air force officers : 16. Iranian air force mechanics: 100. Civilians: 80. A further three British mechanics are now en route for service at the factory. The factory is engaged on the assembly of fuselages for Hawker and De Havilland aircraft, the reconditioning of Hawker and De Havilland machines and repairs^ and overhauls. Progress is said to be slow. Landing Grounds and Aerodromes. 297. Work on the military aerodrome at Kermanshah has been actively carried on, and considerable quantities of stone for the landing ground s foundations has been dealt with. The aerodrome, used hitherto only rarely by occasional machines, was during the last few weeks of the year the scene of an unwonted activity owing to the arrival of the aeroplane conveying air mails between Tehran and Kermanshah and vice versa. Shortage of Lubricants and Petrol. 298. At certain periods during the year under review there has been a serious shortage of petrol and lubricants at the Mehrabad and Qila Murgha military aerodromes, also at Doshanteppeh. In consequence, flying has been curtailed. The petrol storage tanks at Mehrabad and Qila Murgha military aerodromes have been found to be leaking badly. Courses of Instruction. 299. Fifteen officers and men of the Iranian air force left Tehran for England for a course of instruction on the “Hind” machines on order from Messrs. Hawker Aircraft Company (Limited). Desertions. 300 During November two Iranian air force officers deserted by taking a service machine (Hawker “ Audax ”) from the Meshed aerodrome and flying it over the Russian frontier. ( The Iranian Navy. New Vessels. 301. In May it was reported that six motor boats of 250 tons displacement and capable of a speed of 40 m.p.h. had been ordered from Italy. They were to be employed on preventive duties. Up to the end of the year they had not arrived. Target Practice. 11 302. The sloops Babr and Palang and the smaller sloops Shahbaz, Shahrukh and Karkas carried out target practice for a week near Hen jam. Personnel. 303 In August an Italian engineer arrived at Khorramshahr to take charge of the naval workshop. In November His Majesty’s Government signified their willingness to supply an expert to assist the Iranian navy in meteorological and hydrographical duties. Casualties. 304 In November the sloops Babr and Palang w T ere in collision in the Karun Palang came off lightly and was repaired locally Babr whose stern post was badly buckled above water line, was repaired m the Anglo-lraman Oil Company’s marine workshop. In December the floating dock at Bandar bhahpur a^ain broke loose, but was subsequently reanchored.10245—49 [19400] B THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT Printed for the use of the Foreign Office.

THE year 1938 passed, for Iran, in a comparative tranquillity which might well be envied elsewhere. From the Iranian point of view T the main events of the year were two the engagement, announced in May, of the Crown Prince to Princess Fowzieh, sister of the King of Egypt, and the completion of the Trans- Iranian Railway, the formal opening of which took place in August. Both of these events were a source of pride and satisfaction to the modernised Iranian citizen; to what extent they were appreciated by the masses of the population must remain a matter for speculation. 2. The completion of the railway from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian is, however, it appears, by no means the end of the story. As soon as it was finished and before it could be brought into operation plans were under discussion for a further programme entailing some 2,800 kilom. of further construction. The new lines will not present such formidable natural obstacles as the Trans-Iranian, and it seems clear that the Shah is determined to push on with the new programme. At the close of the year it had not been decided, or at any rate not announced, whether the new lines were to be entrusted to foreign contractors or to be under taken by the Government with the aid of European experts and engineers, whose services can, owing to recent events in Europe, easily be obtained. The Iranian taxpayer has thus to face the prospect, for another five years or more, of continuing to find the funds for railway construction, probably on the same scale as during the3 [19400] c* last five years. The financing of the new construction, and especially of* thatj^strt, ■ of it which calls for payments abroad, is bound to prove a severe strain on The country’s resources. 3. The financial situation of the country, especially as regards the provision of foreign exchange, showed no improvement during the year, nor can any improvement be expected while expenditure on military and railway supplies continues on the present scale. 4. The commercial agreement with the Soviet Union expired during 1938, and at the end of the year neither had it been renewed, nor had the revision of the clearing agreement with Germany been successfully accomplished. The Imperial Bank of Iran endeavoured throughout the year to reach some agreement for the transfer of its profits to London, but this question also had reached no conclusion at the end of the year. 5. The last months of the year were, in fact, made notable by a number of crises and abrupt reversals of decisions believed to have been finally taken. The Minister of Communications, M. Ahy, after being held up by the Shah as a model for his colleagues, was dismissed and, it is generally believed, imprisoned. The arrangements for entrusting the new railway construction to the Kampsax Consortium were practically concluded, only to be cancelled or at any rate postponed. The amended German clearing agreement fell through at the last moment. It seemed, indeed, as if the Shah’s ministers could do nothing which would be approved by their master. 6. There was thus an increasing feeling of uneasiness throughout the autumn, which culminated on the 30th December, when it became known that diplomatic relations with France had been broken off owing to certain remarks, taken by the Shah to be offensive to him, in the French press. Curiously enough, the Minister for Foreign Affairs had, only some four weeks before, been expressing satisfaction at the attitude of the foreign press in general and of the French press in particular, while on the 6th December the French Minister had had a very satisfactory audience with His Imperial Majesty. It has long been a truism that the most friendly conduct of a foreign Government counts as nothing when weighed against an offensive article in even the most obscure organ of the foreign press. France has been the victim to provide an extreme instance of this fact; all the educational and charitable work carried on by the French for so many years is forgotten in a moment when some of the old jokes are trotted out in a comic paper. The fact that at any moment the Shah may be infuriated by some press article and may take his revenge in some quite unforeseeable direction is a constant source of anxiety to the diminishing number of foreign representatives here whose countries still possess a free press. 7. The past year provided some good examples of the Shah’s habit of rapidly changing the members of his Government. In the Ministry for Foreign Affairs there have been three Ministers and two Under-Secretaries of State, the latter post being vacant for the last months of the year. The Minister of Education, who had done much for the introduction of modern education in Iran, was also dismissed. The numerous changes resulted in lowering, rather than improving, the general standard of ability in the Government, and it is a matter for surprise that the Shah can accomplish so much with such inadequate advisers. 8 8. Relations between Iran and the United Kingdom have during 1938 presented few features which call for special comment. The Shah, there is no doubt, was extremely anxious as regards the effects which a European war might have caused in Iran, and he expressed to His Majesty’s Minister his great satisfaction at the policy adopted by His Majesty’s Government at the time of the September crisis. So far, therefore, as world politics were concerned, Iranian policy was in sympathy with that of His Majesty’s Government. As regards local relations, the only disagreeable features were the continued boycott of foreigners and the expulsions of British Indian subjects from East Iran. Particulars of these expulsions are given later in this report; it is enough to mention here that the main hardship entailed is the financial losses which are incurred by the persons expelled owing to the operation of the exchange control.9. With other countries Iran’s relations have taken a fairly normal course. Difficulties have arisen with Germany owing to the considerable sums owing by Iran under the clearing agreement. There have been minor troubles with the Soviet Union owing to the Soviet Government’s suspicion of the commercial progress made by Germany in Iran and their fear of Germany’s acquiring excessive influence here. The Iranians seem, however, to be fully aware of this danger and there is no reason to suppose that they have lost their old skill at playing off one foreign Government against another. 10. The relations between Iran and the Soviet Union have further been marred by one tragic episode. The Soviet Government in the early part of the year decided to expel from the country all resident Iranian citizens, and they have been arriving in batches throughout most of the year. The number expelled so far is probably about 40,000. These unfortunate people arrive practically destitute, and their lot is made worse by the fact that the Iranians suspect that the opportunity has been taken to introduce Communist agents into the country. The present policy is to send the refugees into the inhospitable areas of the south and for large numbers of them there can be but little hope of survival. 11. The year 1938 produced one social innovation, a dinner given by the Shah to the heads of foreign missions and their wives, at which the Queen and Princesses were present. This event was heralded as a first step towards more normal social relations between Iranians and foreigners in Tehran : it was followed, rather typically, by a still further reduction of those who “ frequent foreign houses.” II.— Foreign Relations. (A) British Empire — General. (1) United Kingdom and India. (a) General. 12. In March His Majesty’s Minister visited Bombay and New Delhi. At Delhi he had the advantage of exchanging views on various Indo-Iranian questions with the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. 13. In the course of the year no further move was made from any quarter for the negotiation of a new treaty between Great Britain and Iran. In the event of the suggestion being renewed from the Iranian side, it was agreed that His Majesty’s Minister should take the line that it would not be worth while discussing a general agreement unless the Iranian Government were ready to include in it a recognition of the relations of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom with the Arab rulers, and a renunciation of their claims to Bahrein and the islands in the Gulf. Nor would His Majesty’s Government be prepared to offer a quid pro quo for the surrender of claims that they believe to be unfounded. (b) Persian Gulf. Bushire Residency. 14. On two occasions in the course of the year the political resident proceeded to England for longish periods. On each occasion it was arranged that His Majesty’s Consul at Bushire should discharge Sir Trenchard Fbwle’s duties as Consul-General,, and that the acting political resident should continue to reside at Bahrein. This averted the necessity of seeking the Iranian Govern ment’s agrement for Mr. Weightman. 15. In September, when the possibility of a European war seemed imminent, it was agreed that in the event of hostilities breaking out the political resident would require to transfer his residence from Iranian territory to the Arab side of the Gulf. 16. The Iranian Government requested the transfer to them of a telephone exchange situated at Bahmani which was being operated, at a slight loss, by the Residency. This exchange was, it appears, constructed by British authorities during the Great War, and the Iranian Ministry of Posts had hitherto agreed to1 allow the Residency to manage it on condition that a sum equivalent to the normal subscriptions was paid to them. It connected the houses of a number of British residents. With the consent of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and of the Government of India, the exchange was duly handed over in November, without payment. The Iranian authorities allowed the retention of one private line connecting the two offices of the residency. 17. In September the Iranian authorities took exception to correspondence addressed to the political resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, and Sir Trenchard Eowle again took such action as was possible to prevent his being so addressed. 18. Difficulties were raised by the Iranian Government early in the year in connexion with the delivery of a bag to His Majesty’s Consulate-General at Bushire, apparently arising from the fact that it had not been personally taken from ship to shore by the captain of the British vessel carrying it, who alone held a courier’s passport, but had been carried ashore by the local agent of the shipping company. A second somewhat similar complaint was subsequently made by the Iranian Government, and this time it became clear that both complaints referred not to diplomatic bags, but to ordinary mail-bags, which had been taken ashore bv the Residency launch. An apology was conveyed for the misunderstanding which had led to this. Lengthy oral discussions as to future arrangements ensued with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, who were finally requested to give formal approval to the arrangement hitherto in force by which the agent of the shipping line brought the bags ashore. No reply was received, but no further difficulty was experienced. Lights and Buoys. 19. Early in the year a note was received from the' Iranian Government, regarding questions arising in connexion with the installation of new lights in the Persian Gulf. In some respects this communication was not unsatisfactory. Thus the note said that instructions had been issued that whenever a new light or buoy was installed, a warning notice would be published. But as a reply to the representations which His Majesty’s Legation had been making on the general question of lighting and buoying in the Gulf, it was disappointing. The only part of its contents applicable to the general question was the repetition in writing of the assurance already given orally that no steps would be taken for the removal of an existing light until the light to replace it was completely ready. Even this was a little ambiguous, seeing that removal devolved upon British authorities. No answer was given regarding three points which had been raised semi-officially, namely, co-operation with the Bombay Lighting Committee of Shipowners, the dues to be paid by Admiralty oilers, and the limitation of dues to the amount necessary to cover operating costs and the depreciation of the lights and buoys in service. Nor was there any reference to a suggestion which had been made to the Iranian Government to the effect that the details of the new arrangements to be made might be settled by a meeting of qualified experts on both sides. 20. The Foreign Office did not feel that any useful purpose would be served by pressing the Iranian Government either as regards the above three points, or as regards the suggestion of a meeting of experts. On the latter point they were mindful of information received from Sir John Ward, who was of the opinion that the Iranian Government would never consent. Sir John Ward also explained that the lights which were being erected by the Iranian authorities had been supplied by reliable firms, and that great care had been taken in their selection. 21. In 1937 His Majesty’s Legation, on instructions from the Government of India, had asked that further particulars, namely, the height above high- water and the candle-power, should be given in notices concerning lights. The Iranian Government eventually agreed to this, part of the long delay being due to the fact that they lost the relevant papers for about five months. In their reply, which was not received until September, they also agreed that one month’s notice would be given before a new light entered into service. They also referred, rather vaguely, to the proposed meeting of experts in technical questions, and admitted that such discussion might possibly from time to time be arranged. [19400] c* 2 ^Visits of Ships of the Royal Navy. 22. During the year a number of routine visits were paid to Bushire and Abadan by His Majesty's ships attached to the Persian Gulf Division. These seem to have passed oh successfully, though there was in several instances the usual difficulty in getting the Iranian Government to send out the necessary instructions to the local authorities in time. 23. Much more trouble was caused in connexion with the arranging of details for the visit, at the end of November, of H.M.S. Norfolk, with the Commander-in-chief on board. His Majesty’s Legation informed the Iranian Government that they presumed that, in accordance with the relevant Iranian regulations a programme for the exchange of calls and other ceremonies would be drawn up by the Iranian Government, Repeated reminders failed to elicit a reply, and a week before Norfolk arrived the programme had not yet been sanctioned. Ultimately arrangements had to be made locally; they were complicated first by the absence of the major part of the Iranian fleet at sea, and, secondly, by court mourning for Atatiirk, which prevented Iranians from attending the receptions which were organised in honour of the visit. Interference with Arab Dhows. 24. During the year His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had under consideration the question of what attitude should be adopted in the event of a recurrence of incidents due to Iranian interference with Arab dhows. It was finally decided that the action to be taken by His Majesty’s ships in the Persian Gulf to protect vessels of the Arab Sheikhdoms under British protection should be on the following lines: Protection against interference by Iranian ships should be afforded in the territorial waters of the Arab States concerned, and on the high seas up to the limit of Iranian territorial waters recognised by His Majesty’s Government, namely, 3 miles, and not the 6 miles claimed by Iran. The need for the utmost tact and discretion was emphasised in the instructions issued by the Admiralty, but in the very last resort the use of force was to be authorised to obtain the release of an arrested dhow. 25. A welcome step was made by the Iranian Government in April, when they brought to the notice of His Majesty’s Legation reports of certain instances of piracy and slave-trading in the Gulf, with the request that suitable action might be taken against two individuals concerned in such operations, Chakir Murad Baluch and Mustafa Khan Baluch. Otherwise, they said, the Iranian navy would itself have to take action. An immediate telegram was sent to the Political Resident at Bushire, who replied that a watch was already being' kept for Chakir Murad. This information, and the substance of further reports, was duly passed on to the Iranian Government. A strict watch was kept by the sloops of the Persian Gulf Division, but up to the end of the year Chakir had eluded all attempts to capture him. Bahrein, Expulsions of Iranians. 26. In June the Iranian Government made vigorous oral representations following complaints about the treatment of Iranian subjects in Bahrein It was made clear that these representations were without prejudice to the Iranian Government’s known attitude as regards the Sheikh and the position of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in Bahrein. It was alleo-ed that m connexion with the nationality and property laws some 200 Iranian 'families were being expelled and some 500 to 600 persons imprisoned under atrocious conditions As a contrast, reference was made to the “considerate” treatment which the Iranian Government were showing to the Berberis, whom thev were expelling (paragraphs 47 to 52 of this report). The Iranian Government requested the good offices of His Majesty’s Government in this question as the latter were in such close relations to the Sheikh. tv/t • 27 ‘ &gt; ^ n fl ulr . i6s were made by the Political Resident, at the request of His Majesty s Legation, as a result of which it transpired that the action which had ^een taken m Bahrein had nothing to do with the Bahrein Nationality and Property Law, but had been taken under a King’s Regulation of 1937 which provided for the expulsion of all foreigners entering Bahrein without valid7 travel papers. It was explained that the application of this Regulation had in practice been restricted to indigents with whom Bahrein had been flooded. One hundred and forty-four Iranians had been tried, and of these 104 had been deported. Five foreigners of other than Iranian nationality had also been deported. The Political Agent at Bahrein categorically denied the allegation of harsh treatment. The above information was duly communicated to the Iranian Government, who were assured that the expulsions had been concluded unless the number of indigents were to increase again. 28. No further expulsions were reported, and the Iranian Government let the matter drop. The question was not given any publicity in the vernacular press. One interesting feature of the episode was that it marked a change in the attitude hitherto' adopted by the Iranian Government towards Bahrein. Though they were careful to maintain orally Iran’s claim to sovereignty, and though their approach only amounted to enlisting the good offices of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, the fact that diplomatic action was taken amounted in practice to a de facto admission of His Majesty’s Government’s position in Bahrein. 29. Another oral complaint concerning Bahrein was to the effect that the children born in Bahrein of persons whom the Bahrein authorities recognised as Iranians were not being allowed to attend the Iranian schools there. After enquiries had been made, it was explained that such a grievance did not exist, since while it was true that boys regarded as Bahreini nationals were not allowed to attend foreign schools, Iranian parents could easily get round the rule, as they were specifically entitled to register their sons as Iranians within two years of their birth. Bahrein, Sovereignty. 30. At the end of December 1937 the Iranian Government had addressed a note to His Majesty’s Minister protesting against the Bahrein Property Law, as / // an infringement of Iran’s sovereign rights. In February 1938 the Iranian repre- sentative at Geneva communicated a copy of this note to the Secretary-General to the League of Nations, with the request that it should be passed on to States members of the League. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, commenting on this communication in a note to the League, also for circulation to members, explained that they had nothing to add to the statement on this subject contained in a note addressed by His Majesty’s Minister to the Iranian Government on the 9th September, 1937, a copy of which had been transmitted to the League. 31. It was confirmed early in the year that the Iranian authorities were refusing to accept telegrams either from or to Bahrein. The question of repre sentations to the Iranian Government was discussed, but it was decided that no i useful purpose could be secured thereby. J Wireless Stations in the Gulf. 32. Following upon the closing of wireless stations previously controlled by British interests, gifts of the apparatus were in several cases made to the Iranian Government. This was the case during 1938 with the apparatus at Lingah (where also the buildings were handed over) and at Bushire. Actually, in the case of the gift at Lingah (and it transpired in 1938 that in Hen jam the same mistake had occurred in 1935) rather more was given, owing to a misunder standing on the part of Cable and Wireless (Limited), than had been authorised. Little of real value was, however, involved. 33 * * * * * 33. In February the Iranian Government approached His Majesty’s Legation in the hope of arranging for the exchange of information on meteorological subjects, to assist aviation and navigation, between the Iranian stations at Bushire and Jask and Karachi. Two main difficulties arose in the way of fully complying with this request: first, the somewhat elementary nature of the Iranian organisation, and, secondly, the fact that the Karachi station was already overburdened. Also the Iranian Government were somewhat vague as [19400] d* HHMHM8 to exactly what they wanted. Eventually, the question became shelved pending the outcome of inter-departmental discussions in London on the procedure to be followed in the case of aircraft in distress in the Persian Gulf. Meteorology. 34. In 1937 the Iranian Government had enquired whether the services of a British meteorological expert for instructional purposes and for superintending the establishment of meteorological posts in Gulf ports could be made available. Every effort was made to find a suitable candidate, but things were not helped by the difficulty which was experienced in obtaining exact information as to what the conditions of service were to be. The correspondence continued until April 1938. Eventually it proved impossible to find a suitable candidate of the low rank suggested by the Iranian Government, and the latter stated that they had decided to abandon the idea of creating this post. Meteorological Stations. 35. The Government of India agreed in 1937 to present to the Iranian Government the instruments which had been in use at the Han jam Observatory, closed down in 1935. These were found to be in poor condition, and the Govern ment of India decided that they would instead present to the Iranian Government an entirely new set of instruments, through the Iranian Consul at Bombay. 36. In the summer the Iranian authorities stated that weather reports in code could in future only be accepted from meteorological stations in Iran, reporting to India, provided a copy of the code used was deposited with the local authorities and provided a form of agreement for the use of code telegrams for this purpose was signed. The matter was taken up by His Majesty’s Legation with the central authorities, and, after consultation with the Government of India, one copy of the code used at instrumental observatories and one copy of that used at non-instrumental observatories were deposited with these authorities, who agreed to regard this course as complying with the regulations. Separate forms of agreement were signed by the various observers. Mail Services in the Gulf. 37. Representations were made to His Majesty’s Legation early in February against the revised sailing schedules of the British India Steam Navigation Company’s Gulf services—the Iranian Government desired a weekly fast mail service between Iranian ports, calling at both Bushire and Bandar Abbas, in place of the arrangement of a weekly slow service, reinforced by a fortnightly fast service, which the company had introduced in 1937. The Government of India shared His Majesty’s Legation’s view that this was a matter entirely for negotiation between the Iranian Government and the company. No action was accordingly taken. Shipping Incidents. 38. An incident involving the British India Steam Navigation Company’s steamship Bandra occurred in the inner anchorage at Bushire in March. A complaint was lodged by the coolies engaged on unloading the ship against the second officer, whose efforts to prevent pilfering had resulted in a scuffle. The Iranian naval authonties ordered an investigation. The ship was, however allowed to sail following upon an undertaking given by the agents that the second officer would be available for an enquiry on the return voyage In due course he was interrogated by the civil court. Subsequently, without the permission of the public prosecutor, he rejoined his ship.' This led to an oral communication from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The officer was removed from the Persian Gulf run by his employers, and at the end of the year it looked as if the case against him had been abandoned. 39 * * * 39. Two minor incidents involving Iranian coolies occurred on the steamship City of Dunkirk Abadan. After a brief investigation, however the port officer allowed the ship to proceed without further trouble. Another incident at Abadan took place on the steamship Forreshank, whose third officer[19400] D * 2 9 was accused of striking a coolie. This affair was also settled with little delay after investigation. 40. At the request of the owners, the Iranian Government were asked whether the ban placed upon the entry of the steamship Treherbert into Iranian waters, as a result of an incident in which her former captain was involved in 1936, might be removed. The Iranian Government declined, however, to withdraw this ban. Minor Incidents involving Diplomatic Representations. 41. The assistance of His Majesty’s Legation was invoked in a tiresome dispute in which the British India Steam Navigation Company became involved with the National Bank of Iran. A representative of the latter was discovered in an attempt to convey from Bushire to Khorramshahr a consignment of 4 million rials as personal baggage. He undertook to obtain the freight due on such a consignment according to the company’s freight regulations (20,000 rials) on arrival at Khorramshahr, but the bank flatly refused to honour this arrange ment. With the authority of the Foreign Office, the matter was taken up semi-officially with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Repeated reminders had failed to elicit a reply by the end of the year, but shortly afterwards a letter was received from the Ministry which seemed to offer the prospect of a satisfactory settlement. Visas and Endorsements for Arab States. 42. Early in July, acting on instructions from the Foreign Office, His Majesty’s Legation addressed a written protest to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on account of the inconvenience caused to British subjects by the Iranian Government having instructed their consular and local authorities not to recognise passports bearing visas or endorsements for any of the Arab States in the Persian Gulf. 43. The Foreign Office explained that, in instructing His Majesty’s Legation to take the above action, they were not optimistic as to its altering the Iranian attitude, but they wished to place on record their view that the Iranian action was not well-founded. 44. At the end of the year His Majesty’s Legation were informed by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the difficulty for British subjects created by their attitude was in practice being avoided; that pending a decision on the principle involved the Iranian authorities concerned had been instructed to accept separate identity certificates carrying a photograph of the bearer. If, for instance, an Iranian consul abroad received an application for a visa from a British subject whose passport bore one of the unacceptable endorsements, he was authorised to ignore the passport and to grant a visa on a separate identity paper. (c) East Iran. General. 45. There was no marked change in Anglo-Iranian relations in East Iran in 1938. The principal event, the expulsion of some 130 Berberis, mainly from the neighbourhood of Kalata Kush, is dealt with fully in subsequent paragraphs. The expulsions were made in accordance with the Iranian Government s repeatedly admitted policy of removing foreigners from frontier districts. A few other incidents occurred; in most of them the representations of His Majesty s consular officers, or, in the last resort, of the legation, resulted in some kind of punishment being inflicted on the Iranian culpables. The punishments were, however, invariably inadequate and can have constituted only a very modest deterrent on local high-handedness. 46 * * 46. Even after the closing of the Soviet Consulate-General in Meshed, the boycott of His Majesty’s consular establishments continued, but became perhaps more ludicrous than vicious; in Zahidan it seemed even to be relaxed.10 Expulsions of British Indian Subjects. 47. Early in April a number of Berber is, of whom half were Afghans, the remainder British Indian subjects (they could actually be called British subjects in little more than name), were summoned to Meshed from the villages outside where they had been resident for years, and were informed by the police that they could not be permitted to reside in Iran any longer. The case of the British Berberis was immediately taken up by His Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorassan with the Governor-General for Khorassan. The latter gave as a reason for this step the fact that it was undesirable that there should be in the rural districts a number of foreign nationals who refused to comply with the regula tions regarding the unveiling of women and the wearing by men of Trilby hats. More probably the main reason was a groundless suspicion that many Berberis were in secret British employ. This suspicion no doubt arose from a knowledge that a number of Berberis were, as ex-soldiers of the Indian army, in receipt of pensions from the Government of India. 48. With little delay formal orders for expulsion were served on seventeen of these people, though the actual number affected, including dependents, was sixty-nine. Their case was duly taken up with the Iranian Government, on whom the unfortunate effect in India of wholesole expulsions was impressed. In the meantime, the Berberis were advised to follow the procedure which the Iranian authorities had in 1935 promised would be followed in the case of expulsions. According to this procedure, appeals were to be lodged with the Ministry of the Interior; if these were not accepted, expulsions could only be proceeded with thirty days after the issuing of second formal orders of expulsion. As a result of the representations made by the legation, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs undertook to bring the matter to the attention of the Prime Minister. 49. At the same time consideration was given to the possibility of securing better treatment for the Berberis whose expulsion was imminent by the threat of retaliatory action against Iranians resident in India. It was felt that such a threat might well prevent these expulsion orders from being carried out, but that there would, on the other hand, be many disadvantages, of which one would be that the many Berberis remaining in Iran would find their lives made burdensome by the Iranian authorities. More important was the consideration that it was impossible to foresee the ultimate effect of retaliation on the general relations between the Iranian Government and the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. This threat was accordingly never made, though it was intimated to the Iranian Government that there was a possibility that the Government of India would have to consider their attitude towards unsatisfactory Iranians in India (bands of roving gipsies were in mind), • if further expulsions of British subjects were to take place. 50 * 50. Repeated representations continued to be made, however, to the Iranian Government, in the hope, faint though this was, of securing a revocation of the expulsion orders, but it soon became clear that the Iranian Government had definitely made up their minds to proceed with the orders, giving way only in the sense that they would allow the promised procedure, namely, thirty days’ grace after the issuing of the second orders, to be applied. The main efforts of His Majesty’s Legation became accordingly directed to securing permission for those expelled to export their capital to enable them to make a fresh start in life on their arrival in India. Hope that some concession would be made was strengthened by the fact that at the very beginning of the incident the Governor- General for Khorassan had given an assurance that payment would be made for the immovable property of those affected, and by the fact that he himself subsequently enquired why His Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorassan could not take over the rials representing the Berberis’ capital, use them for the official purposes of the consulate-general and reimburse the Berberis in India in rupees. Particularly, as this suggestion had been made by a high Iranian official, it was felt proper to take it up with the Iranian Government, though an infraction of the latter’s regulations was involved in the event of its adoption. Somewhat surprisingly the concurrence of the Iranian Government was obtained without difficulty, and ultimately they raised no objection to the taking over by His Majesty’s Consul-General of so large a sum as 286,400 rials. This amount was[19400] d* 3 11 greater than it had originally been expected would be realised by the sale of the JBerberis’ property, but the increase was to a certain extent due to the fact that, by arrangement with the Governor-General, the departing Berberis took with them more dependents than had first been contemplated, including even a number who had acquired Iranian nationality. Indeed, the total number of Berberis who left, in the month of June, reached the figure of 137, 39 of whom could legitimately be claimed by the Iranian authorities as Iranian nationals. 51. On the whole the incident seemed to have passed off: as satisfactorily as could have been expected, and it was hoped that for the time being at least there would be no more trouble over the Berberis. This hope was unfortunately not fulfilled. Hardly a month after the departure of the exiles four more British Indian subjects, two of whom were resident at Zabul and two at Zahidan, were ordered to leave the country, and a few weeks later six more, resident at Zahidan, received similar orders. All of those affected except one had previously served in the Indian army, and in the case of four the local authorities freely admitted that this was the reason for their expulsion. This time not all were Berberis— two were Sikhs, men of comparative substance, and one was a Punjabi. The last mentioned was about to be engaged on the staff of His Majesty’s Consulate- General for Khorassan, and this was adduced as an additional reason for recon sideration of his case in the representations that were made to the Iranian Government. In these representations it was pointed out by His Majesty’s Minister that he foresaw that these further expulsions might lead to a serious situation; any action implying discrimination against Indians would be deeply resented in India, and a demand might well arise for a revision of the attitude of tolerance which had hitherto been adopted towards Iranians in India. Similar representations were made by the Government of India to the Iranian Consul- General at New Delhi. Subsequently, however, since past experience showed that there was little prospect of succeeding in obtaining a revocation of the expulsion orders, at any rate in the case of the Berberis, the representations became largely directed towards the securing of permission from the Iranian Government for the victims to export their capital in the form of goods—it was felt that His Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorassan had in the earlier cases already taken over as many rials as was wise and that this form of assistance could not continue to be granted. Finally, at the last possible moment—indeed, in one case it was too late—the matter reached the Council of Ministers, and a delay was granted to make negotiations possible with a view- to a settlement of exchange problems. In the case of the two Sikhs, permission was eventually granted to them to export their capital by means of the purchase of carpets, which were to be allowed out of Iran without restrictions. Later this was extended to the others affected by the expulsion orders, who were all allowed to export their capital by means of goods which were not a Government monopoly. Though some con cession was thus made in these instances, the victims were by no means so fortunate as those whom His Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorassan had been able to assist, by taking over their rials, earlier in the year. The latter were able to secure the advantage of the official rate of exchange, whereas the former received a concession which in practice meant that they had to export their capital at the black rate, involving in effect a loss of some 50 per cent. Indeed practically all of them decided to run the risk of purchasing rupees on the black market, rather than follow the devious method of purchasing and then re-selling goods. 52 * * * 52. It was inevitable that these many expulsions should have a bad effect on the morale of the Indian communities in East Iran. This was, however, to a great extent restored as a result of the eviction from India of sixty-nine Iranian gipsies. This affair is discussed in paragraph 64 of the present report. The eviction of the gipsies had nothing to do with the expulsions from Iran, but nevertheless the two matters seem to have become associated in the minds of the Iranian authorities. At any rate the gipsy incident appears to have resulted in a temporary cessation of threats against the Indians in Zahidan. It did not, however, prevent one further expulsion of a British Indian subject, resident in Zahidan,* towards the end of the year.12 Seizure of Bus Hired by His Majesty's Consul-General for Khorassan. 53. In March a bus hired by His Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorassan to convey part of his staff back from Zabul to Meshed became involved in a minor collision with a bus conveying Iranian soldiers and a convoy of arms. The Iranian officer in charge of the latter adopted a threatening attitude, and commandeered the consulate bus, in spite of the fact that it proved possible to effect adequate repairs to his own bus on the spot. The consulate bus was held up as a result for two days. An official protest was addressed to the Iranian Government in connexion with this incident, and in this it was pointed out that, apart from the other considerations involved, the regulations issued by the Iranian authorities themselves, in connexion with the commandeering of transport, had been infringed. A small sum was claimed for hire of the bus—in accordance with the Iranian regulations—and the hope was expressed orally that an apology would be forthcoming. Repeated reminders were made, but no reply was received until later in July. This answer was of an entirely unsatisfactory nature, and the representations were renewed. Many further reminders were addressed to the Iranian Government, but no further communication had been received from them at the end of the year. Lorry Drivers. 54. Regular reminders were addressed to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the question of compensation for the British Indian drivers whose lorries had been commandeered at Zahidan as long ago as 1935. At last, in November, the Iranian Government said that instructions had been issued to the Treasury of the army to pay the claims. Only one of the drivers concerned could be found in Tehran: he was informed by His Majesty’s Legation that he should present himself to the authorities for payment of his claim; His Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorassan took the necessary steps as regards the drivers in or near Zahidan. Two individual cases of ill-treatment of British Indian drivers were also taken up; those of Sohan Singh and Mohan Lai. In the former a written reply, admitting the culpability of the Iranian officer, was eventually received; in the latter His Majesty’s Legation were at the end of the year still pressing for a reply. A third case, in which an officer refused to pay his fare, was taken up in June; the name of the driver was Asa Singh. Frontier Incidents in Baluchistan. 55. A number of incidents took place during the year on the frontier in Baluchistan. Two incidents occurring late in 1937 had been brought to the attention of Llis Majesty’s Legation by the Iranian Government in December 1937. The latter alleged that on each occasion large parties of British Indian troops had crossed the border into Iran. The enquiries which the Government of India made early in 1938 showed both allegations to be largely unfounded, and an appropriate communication was made to the Iranian Government. It was pointed out that there had probably been some misunderstanding as regards Kastag, the locality involved—Kastag village was clearly shown on the map to be in Iranian territory, but the river and plain that bore the same name were partly in Iran and partly in British Baluchistan. (Subsequently it became evident that one of the incidents, when the Iranian Government had alleged that a party of over 100 British Indian troops had crossed the frontier, had some basis, since the Assistant Political Agent in Makran had, as a result of misdirection, accidentally gone into Iran, with a small party, for a short distance. This w r as explained to the Iranian Government.) 56 56. The occasion was taken to bring to the attention of the Iranian Govern ment three instances in which, according to reports received by the Government of India, Iranian troops had between February and May been guilty of violations of the frontier, and had behaved in a high-handed manner towards residents in British territory. In the most serious case three such residents were compelled by force to accompany the Iranian party back into Iranian territory. The return of these captives and the punishment of those who had been responsible were demanded, and a strong protest was registered against the action of the Iranian troops in this case and in the other instances. The Iranian Government were at the same time requested to take urgent steps to acquaint their local officials with13 [19400] d* 4 the correct position of the boundary in the area concerned, in order that the repetition of such incidents might be avoided. 57. At about this time the Iranian Government for their part entered protests regarding two further occasions on which they stated British Indian troops had violated the frontier—one of these occasions turned out ultimately to be only a second reference to the time when the Assistant Political Agent in Mekran had, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, accidentally crossed the border. Hardly had this news been passed on to the Government of India, when a telegram was received from them announcing yet another incident, as a result of which one Iranian officer and five soldiers had been arrested on the 31st May for having crossed the border. Almost simultaneously the Iranian Government entered a protest, making it clear that they regarded Bikadouk (or Begadag), the place where the incident had occurred, as in Iranian territory, and demanding the release of their military without delay. It was pointed out to them that the maps in the possession of His Majesty’s Legation clearly showed this place to be well within British Indian territory. The opportunity was taken to repeat to the Iranian Government an observation that had been made earlier in the year, to the effect that in a locality where the boundary had never been accurately demarcated it'was an elementary precaution to observe an adequate territorial margin of safety. It was also again pointed out that it might be possible to eliminate further incidents if agreement could be reached to allow the erection simply of a few frontier pillars in the Kastag plain, where the trouble was occurring. The Iranian Government did not comment on these suggestions, but proceeded to attempt to explain away the incident by stating that the Iranians who had been arrested were military road police in pursuit of smugglers. The Iranian officer and his five troops were released without delay, but the Iranian Government were warned that further arrests would be made if further violations of the frontier were to occur. Frontier Surveying in Baluchistan. 58. In January it was learnt from the Iranian Government that they were proposing to send a technical commission to inspect the frontier line in Baluchistan (of which a part had been surveyed in 1932), and to complete this survey, though actually it appeared that there was no intention to survey the frontier north of Mirjawa. It was expected that the whole survey would take several years. The Government of India agreed to send general instructions to the British authorities in Baluchistan to facilitate the work of the commission, and they arranged for an escort to accompany the Iranian party for purposes of protection. It was some time, however, before the Iranian Government, who desired that their party should be allowed to cross into British territory, could be persuaded to make the same concession as regards the British escort party entering Iranian territory, although a reciprocal arrangement of this kind had been made in 1932 and was obviously necessary, having regard to the nature of the country, if the two parties were to avoid losing touch. 59. The Iranian party arrived at Zahidan towards the end of February, but did not get to the frontier until the end of March. They only remained a few weeks, since they apparently feared attack by local tribes. Work was about to be resumed at the end of the year, though the composition of the party had been changed. Consular rearrangement in East Iran. 60. By May His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India were agreed that the post of vice-consul at Birjand should be abolished and that Birjand should be included in the consular district of the vice-consul at Zabul who would divide his time between the two posts. At Birjand a consular office only would be retained in charge of a clerk of the lower division of the combined Persian Gulf and Khorassan cadre. At the end of July the Iranian Government expressed their concurrence in this arrangement. Cl. In order to meet an economy request from the Government of India that he should surrender 10 per cent, of his travelling allowance, His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed, on consultation with the legation, cancelled his usual winter move to Zabul.The Meshed Shrine. 62. Throughout 1938 it remained British policy that non-Moslem British subjects should not seek nor avail themselves of facilities to visit the Shrine. On the other hand, the Iranian authorities continued their policy of encouraging all persons to visit it, and towards the end of the year showed their confidence in this policy by abandoning the practice of giving formal permissions, and by throwing the Shrine entirely open to the followers of all religions alike. Large numbers of foreigners visited the Shrine : the British were becoming an increasingly noticeable exception, and it became clear, in all the circumstances, that British policy would shortly need to be reconsidered. (d) India. Iranian Representation at Quetta. 63. The Iranian Government continued to consider their passport officer at Quetta a vice-consul, though they had never applied for his formal recognition as such. In May they expressed the desire to promote their representative to consul, and were informed that there was no objection to this. The Government of India duly recognised the appointment. Deportation of undesirable Iranians from India. 64. Towards the end of August the Iranian Consul-General at Simla made representations to the Government of India on behalf of a number of Iranian subjects who had been arrested in the Punjab. These turned out to be members of a band of sixty Iranian gipsies who had been causing considerable trouble by their thieving and rioting. Many of them were without passports, others had deficient passports. These circumstances were explained in detail to the Iranian Consul-General. Ultimately, in September, orders were issued by the Punjab Government for the deportjftion of twenty-nine of the band. Though there was no parallel between the deportation of such undesirables and the deportation from Iran of British Berberis against whom no charges had been laid, the action of the Indian authorities seems to have had, at least temporarily, a restraining effect in Iran—see paragraph 52 of this report. Articles in Indian Newspapers. 65. The Government of India were able on two occasions to obtain the • publication of articles in the Indian press making amends for articles which had been critical of Iran, though in one case the offending article had merely been a verbatim reprint—in the Hindustan Times —of a story originally published in the American periodical Time. Locusts. 66. Late in 1937 the Iranian Government replied officially to a suggestion that had originally been made to them in 1936 that an agreement should be concluded between Iran and India on the question of anti-locust measures. The Iranian Government stated “ that they were not prepared to enter into an agree ment under which they would assume any obligation to take anti-locust measures, and that they were only prepared to consider an agreement for the exchange of information.’' The Government of India prepared' a rough draft of a proposed agreement, which was forwarded to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom for consideration. Customs 67. The Government of India decided to impose a land customs regime, on the land fiontiers of India as from the 1st February. I his information was duly communicated to the Iranian Government—a list of the articles affected had already been given to them in December 1936. In July the Ministry for Foreign Affairs complained about the effect of the customs duties at Nok Kundi on the manufacture of silken goods in Iran, the Iranian Consul at Karachi having reported that these duties were virtually prohibitive.[19400] e* 15 (e) Miscellaneous. Imperial Bank of Iran. 68. Soon after the New Year the Tehran manager of the Imperial Bank of Iran, Mr. Butters, had occasion to discuss with M. Nariman, the acting head of the Exchange Control Commission, the renewal of the existing arrangements, made with the late M. Davar in 1936, by which the bank gave certain credits in favour of the Iranian Government and received authority to conduct operations in foreign exchange. Under this arrangement the bank had already granted a credit of £600,000. At this meeting M. Nariman asked if these credits could be increased to a total of £1 million, and the rate of interest reduced below the 4 per cent. 69. Mr. Butters pointed out to M. Nariman that his board in London could without difficulty obtain in the Middle East a better rate of interest on their money than the 4 per cent, conceded to M. Davar,, he therefore saw no possibility of his being authorised to make any reduction. As regards the desired increase of credit he could not see his board sanctioning this as a straight credit ; if, how ever the proposal could be put to him in the form of handling of business he would give it careful consideration. A few days later the Minister of Finance put forward the same request. Mr. Butters repeated the explanation of the position that he had given to M. Nariman. 70. Hardly a month had elapsed before the request for an advance of £1 million was repeated. This time Mr. Butters asked M. Nariman what satis faction he would be given as regards a whole series of points which he had put to the Minister of Finance, points which were largely designed to free the bank from numerous restrictions on their operations which have been imposed by regulations since their arrangements with M. Davar in 1936. These restrictions have pre vented the bank from doing legitimate business which, incidentally, the National Bank of Iran would not in any case be in a position to handle. No satisfactory reply was forthcoming. 71. Requests for help and further advances have continued throughout the year, and Mr. Butters has given his usual reply that he can hold out no hope of his board responding to these demands unless adequate security is given, unless he is allowed to remit his profits to London in sterling, or unless he is given the actual business for which the Imperial Bank is specially equipped. 72. During December several conversations took place with the Minister of Finance on the subject of remitting profits and though some headway seemed to have been made, no definite decision had been taken. At the close of the year not only were the bank’s future powers and functions still uncertain, there was also the prospect of closing down further branches in the interior of Iran, and even some doubt whether the bank would consider it worth continuing to operate in the country. Anglo-Iranian Oil Company {Limited). 73. Although the A.I.O.C. had another year of active expansion, the oil royalties payable to the Iranian Government showed an appreciable decrease. This caused great disappointment to the Government, who seemed to expect thnt the rise registered in 1937, which was quite an exceptional year, would continue its upward trend. Their disappointment was increased by the fact that their com mitments in 1938 for military material and economic reconstruction had been considerably increased. 74. A matter of grave concern to the company lay in the selection of the areas totalling 100,000 square miles of Iranian territory which the company were obliged to define before the 31st December, under the terms of the 1933 Concession Agreement, as the areas in which they wished to operate their concession for the future. The problem was complicated by the fact that up to certain depths of water modern boring machinery made it possible to tap oil fields lying under the sea, and there were parts of the sea in the Persian Gulf which the company wished to include in the area of their potential operations. While His Majesty’s Government held that 3 miles was the limit of territorial waters, the Persian Government claimed a belt of 12 miles. Along most of the Persian coast the width of sea which the company wished to include in their concession was within16 the 3-mile limit, but at the northern end of the Gulf, there were parts of the sea in the 12-mile belt which they also wished to include. This, of course, would raise the question of recognition of the Persian claim to a territorial limit of 12 miles. 75. In addition, the Iranian Government seemed to suspect some ulterior political motive behind the company’s selection of the areas along the coast and along the whole Irano-Iraqi frontier. By the end of the year the Iranian Government had not endorsed the areas chosen by the company. The question of demarcation of the boundary of the company’s area at the mouth of the Shatt-el- Arab, dividing Persian from Iraqi territorial waters, presented similar difficulties and remained pending. 76. Early in the year the company struck oil in their new field the Gach Saran, which looks at present like being the company’s most promising new field, with an even larger and richer output than the Haft Kel field. 77. The pipe-line from Gach Saran to Abadan, planned for completion early in 1940, will run straight across Khuzistan to Abadan, and will have to traverse the marshes north of the Khor Musa. Gach Saran lying high up in the hills, the oil will travel by gravity all the way, thus eliminating the use of pumping stations. The pipes for this line were landed on a small jetty built at Khor Kazaleh (one of the creeks off the Khor Musa) and strung out in the desert to the north to await welding. 78. Although no definite decision was taken in regard to the site for the new refinery, a thoroughly satisfactory site was reported to have been located just south of Mashur, on one of the inlets giving on to the main Khor Musa. Rumours that the new refinery would be even bigger than that at Abadan, correspond to the company’s high opinion of the Gach Saran field. 79. The project long under consideration to build a second refinery at Bandar Shahpur appeared to have been shelved. Early in the year the Iranian Government were pressing the company to construct a fully equipped port at Bandar Shahpur at the Government’s expense. The Government apparently intended that the company should carry out the whole undertaking, i.e., draw up the plans, execute the work and provide the working capital and on completion piesent a bill to the Government, which would be met out of the oil royalties. 80. It had not proved easy for the company to arrive at a proper estimate of the cost, as the exact requirements of the Government were not known, but it was reckoned that the cost would be in the neighbourhood of £9 million. 81. While the company would welcome a new port to facilitate their oil exports, the proposals of the Iranian Government caused them some uneasiness, and discussions on such important details as the rate of interest on the sums outstanding continued for some months. Later in the year, however, the company were informed by the Minister of Communications that the Iranian Government no longei desired the help of the A.I.O.C. in regard to the port at Bandar Shahpur and that the Government would presently prepare a plan of their own. This was interpreted as meaning that the Shah, having earmarked the oil royalties for othei uses, had told the Minister of Communications that he did not wish to put himself fui thei into the hands of the company, and that the Ministry must oret on with the work themselves. ' &amp; 82. The 1 eisianisatiqn of their personnel, obligatory on the company under the teims of their concession, caused them much concern. The company have loyally carried out this policy in the past, but in 1938 circumstances were impelling them to the conclusion that the temyo must be retarded. There were two reasons for this : {a) that the adulteration of the European and Indian staff by unskilled and unreliable personnel was undermining efficiency, and (6) that it was becoming increasingly difficult to retain in Khuzistan such skilled Iranian labour as they already had, as climate and rates of pay in the north were more attractive. 83 83. To meet this difficulty the company resorted once more to recruiting Indian tradesmen and also organised a special department to recruit Iranian laboui. Appaiently this department was to have representatives throughout[19400] e* 2 17 I w w U Iran, with two or three Europeans acting as travelling inspectors. To add to their labour troubles, the Iranian Government raised objection to the ^mpldjgjieBt by the company of Iranian Armenians. 84. The Anglo-Iranian wireless stations at Abadan and Maidan-i-Naftun I were allotted the sign “ EQZ.” British Insurance Companies. 85. The insurance decree which was approved by the Council of Ministers on the 18th October, 1937, whereby all insurance companies operating in Iran were required to reinsure 25 per cent, of their business with the Iran Insurance Company, came into force on the 16th January, 1938. 86. Representations were made to the Iranian Government, but unfortunately with no success, as the Council of Ministers had decided at a meeting held on the 20th January that the decree would neither be amended nor its application further postponed. 87. Messrs. Fowler and Co., who represented the majority of the British companies working in Iran, immediately informed the Government that, as these companies could not see their way to carry their obligations under the terms of the new insurance decree, the following companies, the Norwich Union, the Eagle and Star, the Yorkshire Insurance Company, the Caledonian and the General Accident Company, had decided to suspend operations in Iran. 88. This reduced the number of foreign insurance companies operating in Iran to four, namely, the Allianz Stuttgarter (German), Gosstrach (Soviet Assurance Company), Royal Insurance Company (Limited) (British) and the Palestine Lloyd (a company registered in Palestine with British capital). 89. In August Mr. H. Watson, a representative of the Royal Insurance Company (Limited), arrived in Tehran to inaugurate the new offices of the company and assumed the local management. So far, none of the British companies who closed down their offices last January appear to have made any representations to the Government with a view to returning to Iran. British Railway Contractors. 90. In spite of the delays suffered in the early stages of their contracts, Messrs. Richard Costain (Limited) and the firm of N.M.K., in which Messrs. Nuttall have a 45 per cent, interest, had completed their lots on the southern section of the railway and were ready to hand over more than a month in advance of the contract date. Subsequently, the two companies were mainly occupied in liquidating their losses and pressing their claims against the Iranian Govern ment. Messrs. Costain, whose loss at one time seemed likely to be in the neighbourhood of £75,000, have been able to reduce it considerably by registering as a merchant company and realising the rials which they required by the import and sale of goods, thus benefiting from a more favourable rate of exchange than they could otherwise obtain. The amounts at which the companies’ claims have been finally assessed by the Iranian Government were not known at the end of the year; both companies, however, had reason to believe that the figures which had been recommended to the Iranian Government by the Claims Commission, and which were generally considered to represent the lowest reasonable assessment, had been further cut down by the Iranian Government. Recourse to litigation, which, in similar circumstances elsewhere, would provide contracting companies with a possible means of redress, is, of course, out of the question, and the companies are, in the last resort, bound to accept any figure which the Govern ment may name. During the negotiations regarding their claims, both companies had cause to complain of the lack of reasonable support from Kampsax, who are reported on many occasions to have shown bias in favour of the Government’s case. Claim of Income Tax from Shipping Companies. 91. The question of income tax to be paid by foreign shipping companies operating in Iranian waters was reopened in February by the Khorramshahr revenue authorities, when the latter demanded from Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie18 and Co. statements of the tonnage of cargo carried by each shipping company represented by them, to and from Iran, as well as a statement of the amonnt of passage money collected by each company in respect of passengers carried jrom and to Iranian ports. At the same time, the company was asked to make a deposit of 500,000 rials and was given ten days within which to produce the information required. 92. It was obvious at once that these instructions could not be complied with and that the revenue authorities were trying to force an issue. 93. Representations were made to the Director of the Income Tax Depart ment in Tehran, who agreed that the delay granted was insufficient and that the claim made against the company was unjustified. M. Ferouhar assured His Majesty’s Legation that he would send the following instructions to the Khorramshahr revenue authorities : (a) to abstain from taking any action what soever pending the receipt of further instructions from Tehran; (b) not to impose any fines or claim deposits; (c) to allow the various shipping companies from three to six months’ delay within which to produce the information required; and (d) that the whole question would be reviewed and a decision taken by the central authorities. 94. In the meantime, the representative of the German Hansa Line informed His Majesty’s Legation that, although he was authorised by his company to effect settlement on a reasonable basis, he was proposing to hold out until the Japanese and Soviet shipping companies had been made to pay income tax. He said that he had put this argument before the Iranian Government, as he was aware that the Soviet companies had not been approached officially and that, even if they were, they would refuse to pay. 95. On the 24th May a preliminary meeting was held in Tehran, at which M. Ferouhar presided, to discuss the question of income tax payable by foreign shipping companies. Mr. Brown, of Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie and Co., Basra, represented Messrs. Frank C. Strick and Co. and the British India Steam Navigation Company. Herr Schliiter represented the Hansa Line. Both repre sentatives were accompanied by their legal advisers. Soviet, Italian and Japanese interests were not represented at this meeting. 96. M. Ferouhar put forward a proposal that a tax of 4 per cent, on a presupposed profit of 7 per cent, on all outgoing traffic should be imposed, the revenue to be established from the companies’ books. This proposal, which was approved by Mr. Brown and turned down by Herr Schliiter, had, however, to be submitted to the Minister of Finance, before a final decision could be taken. For some reason, still unknown, no action appears to have been taken and this vexing question remained unsolved at the end of the year. Navigation on the Knvun River. 97. Reports which had already been freely circulated in 1937 regarding the formation of a monopoly company for the navigation of the Karun, caused a good deal of anxiety to British shipping interests when, in August, the customs authorities at Khorramshahr issued a notice to the shipping companies that as from the 7th October no through-carriage cargo to Ahwaz would be permitted, and that all cargo shipped to Khuzistan ports must either be cleared through Bandar Shahpur or the Khorramshahr customs. At the same time the port authorities at Abadan and Khorramshahr issued a notice regarding craft used in Iran, which stipulated that “craft could not be sent out of Iranian waters ” without the permission of the port authorities. 98. The above instructions appeared in a measure to confirm the report that the Karun Navigation Company was trying to obtain a monopoly of the Karun River traffic, and ultimately to obtain at its own price barges or tugs which the British Iran Transport Company might try to remove from the Karun. 99 99. Representations made to the Iranian Government for the postponement of instructions from the 7th October to allow through cargo already shipped to be cleared under existing regulations, were successful and an extension of four months was granted. Meanwhile the Director of Customs who was also approached explained that the new regulations were not intended to stop through19 cargo shipments to Ahwaz or to discriminate against the Iran Transport Company but merely to prevent irregularities and fraud. The new regulations required that cargo for Ahwaz will be landed on barges which will be examined by customs officials. After goods have been examined and sealed and passavant formalities completed, the same barges would be allowed to proceed to Ahwaz. 100. At the time the assurances given appeared satisfactory, but it soon became evident that either the customs officials at Khorramshahr were trying to exceed their duties or else that they misunderstood the instructions said to have been forwarded to them by the Central authorities, as the Director of Customs at Khorramshahr stated to an official of the Iran Transport Company that after the 6th February, 1939, the barges of the Karun Navigation Company would land all cargo in the customs at Khorramshahr. The director added that the Iran Transport Company might, if a proper case were made out for it, be allowed to transport cargo under passavant from Khorramshahr to Ahwaz. 101. Further representations were made to the Director of Customs who promised to make further enquiries. The position regarding the future of river traffic on the Karun was still not clear at the end of the year, although assurances had been given repeatedly that no discrimination was intended against the British shipping company. Visa difficulties for British Subjects. 102. A number of tiresome visa difficulties had to be taken up with the Iranian Government during the course of the year. In themselves they were relatively unimportant, but they caused much trouble and were a good illustration of the suspiciousness of the Iranian official. Some delay was for instance experienced in obtaining for the new Admiralty fuel inspector at Abadan, Captain Barry, both his original entry visa and subsequently the pass which he required to enable him to board ships at Abadan. Another example concerned two representatives of Ransome and Rapier, who were delayed at Bagdad for over two weeks (though their original applications had been put in before leaving London), and who actually returned to England a day or two before permission for their visas was granted. In their case suspicion seems to have been aroused by the fact that they gave military titles in their original applications. More serious was the case of Major J. B. Cunningham, an officer sent by the Govern ment of India for language study, who could not obtain his residence permit at Isfahan, and who was indeed peremptorily ordered to leave. His case was taken up by His Majesty’s Minister with the Prime Minister, and eventually permission was accorded for him to continue his studies in Tehran. Affairs of British and Foreign Bible Society. 103. In May the society reported the arrest of four of their Iranian workers in Isfahan. The advisibility of addressing enquiries to the Iranian Government was discussed with the bishop in Iran, who was able to report that one worker had already been released and that assurances had been given that two others would also be set free. It was felt that enquiries would not help (an impression which was confirmed by a semi-official talk with the Minister of Education), and indeed the incident was settled in June with the release of all those who had been arrested. British Press comment on Iran. 104. As was almost inevitable the British press came in for criticism from time to time, starting right at the beginning of the year, when the British press was accused in the Iranian papers of publishing daily articles attacking Iran and especially the Shah. The language used was highly hostile and offensive. No official protest was made by the Iranian Government. A week or two later, when the storm had died down, His Majesty’s Minister took the opportunity, when speaking to the Director-General at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, to remind the latter that the press in the United Kingdom was not under official control, as was the case in Iran, and to point out that usually the articles which caused offence were the production of mere gossip writers, and that such articles often were only published in obscure papers. For almost the whole of the rest of the year there was quiet, though a few articles on Palestine appeared in the Tehran press having a more pro-Arab tendency than was customary. In November, however, [19400] ’ e* 3the Iranian Charge d’Affaires in London protested against an article by Rosita Forbes, in which there was derogatory comment on the Shah, and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs later informed His Majesty’s Minister that His Imperial Majesty was very indignant. Fear Murder. 105. Correspondence with the Iranian Government with regard to this case continued during the year. In April the Ministry for Foreign Affairs stated that, of the persons arrested and tried, the principal had died in prison, whilst the other, a comparatively minor accomplice, had been condemned to three years' imprisonment. There was reason to suspect that the name given by the Iranian Government for the main culprit was incorrect, and that in reality he was an officer of the road police, but no proof of this could be adduced. Efforts were made to obtain further details with regard to the trial and the individuals found guilty, but they had not met with any success by the end of the year. British Official News. 106. A the end of 1937 the Iranian Government renewed their objections to the distribution outside by His Majesty’s Legation—limited though it was— of the British official news. In January copies of the news, mailed by His Majesty’s Legation to His Majesty’s Consulates in Iran, were confiscated by the Iranian postal authorities. His Majesty’s Minister interviewed the Director- General at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on this subject. The latter undertook that there would be no further interference with copies sent to His Majesty’s Consulates, but, arguing that the Agence Pars had the sole right to distribute news, declined to approve of the already very limited list of subscribers (in number only six), and was only willing that copies should continue to be supplied to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the Imperial Bank of Iran, apart from the consulates. The Director-General himself requested, however, that copies should continue to be sent, as before, to the Agence Pars. This has proved very useful; the local papers have during the year regularly and freely repeated in their columns items, usually verbatim translations, from the official news. Cultural Propaganda. 107. Cultural propaganda continued on the same modest and tentative lines as in 1937. There was no relaxation of official watchfulness and suspicion of anything savouring of active propaganda. The dismissal in August of M. Hikmat from his post of Minister of Education was a misfortune. Whereas M. Hikmat had always shown himself helpful and anxious to promote English studies, and willing, within the narrow limits possible in Iran, to take decisions on his own responsibility, the present acting Minister of Education has so far not proved so helpful. Dr. Sadiq has remained at his post of head of the National Teachers’ College, and by his continued co-operation has been of great assistance to His Majesty’s Legation. 108. At the beginning of the year some doubt was felt by His Majesty’s Legation regarding the advisability of recommending further candidates for the student bursaries offered by the British Council. This doubt was due to the conditions under which such candidates are nominated by the Iranian authorities without the participation of the legation, and to the fear that graft and influence rather than genuine considerations of merit determined their selection. Such doubts have not yet been dissipated. Nevertheless, after the receipt of a favour able report on the Iranian student who began an eighteen months’ course in England in January 1938 it was decided to ask the Iranian Government to put forward candidates for one student bursary and one post-graduate scholarship for the academic years 1938-40. The student bursary was again in English. For the post-graduate scholarship Dr. Sadiq proposed a student of dramatic art, on the ground that Iran, which possessed rich untapped folk-lore and music and which would shortly possess an opera house also, lacked trained dramatic teachers. This proposal hardly conformed with the British Council’s wish that the post-graduate scholarship should be granted in some technical subject. It was decided, however, to support Dr. Sadiq’s recommendation of the candidate, who was duly accepted by the British Council. At the end of the year His Majesty’s21 [19400] e* 4 Legation were considering possible means by which they would exert some influence on the selection of future candidates, without running too great a risk of offending Iranian susceptibilities. 109. The other activities of the British Council during the year followed the same lines as in 1937. A further presentation of books, to the value of £50, was made to five libraries in Tehran, and prize books were again presented to the Church Missionary Society’s colleges at Isfahan and Kerman. The Council offered to repeat their gift, made in 1936, of a number of lecture gramophone records to the University of Tehran and the Church Missionary Society’s colleges. Dr. Sadiq, replying on behalf of the Department of English of Tehran University and the National Teachers’ College, stated that, though the lecture records had been of use to his pupils, there was a more pressing need at the moment in the form of English text-books. His request that these might be supplied instead of the records was conveyed to the Council. 110. As a mark of the Iranian Government’s appreciation of the British Council’s gifts of books to various institutions in Iran, the Ministry of Education offered to present a collection of modern Persian books to the Council. The offer was accepted, and arrangements were made for the books to be divided between the School of Oriental Studies of London University and the India Office Library. 111. A number of articles on current British topics were offered to the Iranian press for publication. Although the articles were supplied in Persian translations, none have yet appeared. In most cases the subject matter of the articles was such that there could be little possibility of their having a wide appeal among the Iranian public. Claims. 112. In January His Majesty’s Legation were informed orally by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the claim of the Persian Transport Company had been referred again to the Ministry of Communications who had been asked for further information and advice. Nothing further was heard. On behalf of the Persian Railways Syndicate, His Majesty’s Legation forwarded to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in February and December statements of the amount and interest due to the syndicate from the Iranian Government. In conformity with Foreign Office instructions of December 1937 no steps were taken to keep the claims question as a whole before the Iranian Government. Rates Default by Iranian Legation in London. 113. During the year repeated efforts were made to induce the Iranian Government to fulfil their obligations, as they had agreed to do in 1936, in connexion with rates payable on the premises of the Iranian Legation in London, of which considerable arrears were due. Payment of a portion of the amount was eventually made, but all the arrears had not been dealt with before the end of the year, though assurances were given that the amount had been included in a supplementary budget. Consular Premises. 114. Much correspondence took place with the Iranian Government during the year on the question of the leases of property occupied by His Majesty’s Consulates in Iran. This was particularly the case as regards His Majesty’s Consulate at Ahwaz. (1) Ahwaz. —In spite of repeated reminders throughout the year, it proved impossible to secure from the Iranian Government any reply to His Majesty’s Government’s proposals regarding the purchase of a site for the construction of a consulate at Ahwaz. (2) Khorramshahr .—In January the Shatt-el-Arab overflowed its banks and flooded the vice-consulate property at Khorramshahr. The servants’ quarters were completely destroyed and His Majesty’s Vice-Consulate was rendered unfit for human habitation. The A.I.O.C.’s chief engineer estimated that it would cost £3,000 to make the building22 habitable. While it was being ascertained from the Iranian Govern ment, who owned the site, which had been leased from the late bheikh of Mohammerah, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Captain J. E. A. Bazal- gette, was accommodated by the A.I.O.C., but the company, owing to the shortage of houses for their own staff, showed the greatest repugnance to the idea of housing him for an indefinite period. Captain Bazalgette continued to maintain his office in part of the vice-consulate which had not been damaged by the floods. At the end of February the Iranian Government confirmed that the property belonged to the numerous heirs of the late Sheikh of Mohammerah. This reply led to the suggestion that, in default of any suitable alternative site, it might be better to rebuild the vice consulate rather than spend a considerable sum on repairs. The pros and cons of this problem were discussed at considerable length, but owing to the unwillingness of the Government of India to contribute any considerable amount towards the cost of a new vice-consulate, no decision had been taken by the end of the year. Captain Bazalgette, the vice-consul, found the accommodation provided by the company too small for himself and his family. Eventually the company were able to let him use a larger house, but on the understanding that he was soon to be replaced by a bachelor vice-consul. He was, in fact, succeeded in December by Captain Napier, unmarried. (3) Isfahan. —Mr. R. F. G. Sarell, who was acting consul at Shiraz during the summer, discovered when he visited Isfahan early in September that the municipal authorities, in order to construct a new square, had decided to demolish the greater part of the consular rest house on the Chahar Bagh. The rest house was not the property of His Majesty’s Government but was merely taken on lease. The rest house was in fact demolished, the archives had been removed and placed in safe custody. * The selection and renting of a suitable house to serve as a new consulate rest house was deferred in view of the impending arrival of Mr. A. H. King, newly appointed His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz, since it was felt preferable that he should make the selection. (B) Iraq. General. 115. In 1938 Iran and Iraq were mainly content to harvest the fruits of the previous year’s intensive treaty-making. For Iraq the Frontier Treaty’s Shatt- el-Arab fruits were found somewhat bitter in the belly, but by June all the treaties signed in 1937, including the multi-lateral Pact of Saadabad, had been ratified by both countries. The Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs gave effect to the co-operation provided for in the Saadabad Pact by giving tepid support at the meetings of the Council of the League of Nations to the views of the Iraqi Government on Palestine, and M. A’lam, in conversation with His Majesty’s Minister, expressed the hope that an equitable solution would soon be found. 116. An incident deserving record occurred in the spring, when there were reports of an intended wholesale expulsion of Jews from Iran, and, indeed, an expulsion order “was issued by the Iranian authorities in Khuzistan. Since most of those concerned were of Iraqi nationality, the Iraqi Minister made vigorous representations, declaring that such a measure was a poor fruit of the recently signed agreements between Iraq and Iran, and suggesting that his Government might feel obliged to take counter-measures against Iranian merchants in Bagdad. Aftei some delay he was assured that the expulsion order was being cancelled. 1 he general question of the Jews in Iran is referred to in paragraph 177 of this report. r H7. Ift June the then Iiaqi Mamster for Foreign Affairs told His Majesty s Ambassador in Bagdad that real confidence and sympathy had not yet been established between the two countries. This was illustrated by the anxiety felt by the Iraqi General Staff over Iranian purchases of field and mountain23 s artillery, and by the reason given by the Iraqi Government for their desire to build a railway as far as Koweit, viz., that they had become alarmed at the possibility of Persian interference with Iraqi trade on the Shatt-el-Arab. Shatt-el-A rab. 118. His Majesty’s Legation were on no occasion in 1938 concerned with the Irano-Iraqi problems of this river. Early in the year the Iraqi Government developed misgivings as to article 5 of the Frontier Treaty and the protocol regarding the future regime on the river, and the Iraqi Minister in Tehran was instructed to propose to the Iranian Government a verbal insertion into article 5 which would leave Iraq in control of the maintenance and dredging of all the waters for which she is now responsible. No change, however, was got out of the Persian Government. 119. About the same time the Iraqi Government sought the advice of His Majesty’s Government through His Majesty’s Embassy in Bagdad whether they would be wise or not, in view of dissatisfaction expressed in the Parliament and elsewhere in Iraq, to proceed to ratification of the Frontier Treaty. They asked also for British counsel on the convention due to be concluded for settling the future regime on the river. 120. In this latter connexion, His Majesty’s Embassy drew attention to a new consideration, that if the contemplated River Board were created, the Iraqi Government would find themselves handing over very valuable equipment to an organisation in which the Iranian Government had half control, and would be left without adequate equipment of their own for maintaining anchorages or navigation to the open sea. The Iranian Government would also be likely to demand a 50 per cent, representation in the personnel of all the services controlled by the board. 121. In response to the Iraqi Government’s request for their counsel on the above points, His Majesty’s Government did not feel able to advise against ratification of the treaty. As regards the river, they thought that co-operation would be best secured and the dangers of divided authority best avoided by the creation of an independent Advisory Board with a third and British representa tive on it. This board would co-ordinate the work of the Iranian and Iraqi national boards operating in their own national waters and give decisions in the event of disputes. 122. Alternatively, the Iranian and Iraqi Governments might each give undertakings :— (i) That neither would introduce navigational rules in their own waters which conflicted with those obtaining in the remainder of the river; and (ii) That each would consult the other before initiating engineering works which would adversely affect the other. 123. By the end of the year little had been done by either side towards negotiating the River Convention, but on the land frontier the Delimitation Commission provided for by article 3 of the treaty had apparently begun its labours. - (C) Other Countries. Egypt. 124. In May the announcement was made of the engagement of the Crown Prince to Princess Fowzieh, sister of the King of Egypt. This important event is discussed in the Internal Affairs section of the present report, paragraphs 156 to 161. A message of congratulation was telegraphed by His Majesty The King, and similar messages were sent by the heads of virtually all important States. An Iranian delegation, led by the Prime Minister, arrived in Egypt early in June to discuss arrangements for the marriage. In December the Iranian Government enquired whether His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom could provide an escort from the Royal Navy for part of the voyage of the ship carrying the Crown Prince and his bride on the journey back from Egypt following upon the ceremonies to be held there.125. 1938 was a disappointing year for France in her relations with Iran. The French believe that Iran is fertile ground for their co-operation, not least because events, past but not forgotten, have partially queered the pitches of certain other Great Powers. The French Minister, M. Bodard, was very hopeful of achieving fruitful work. Half-way through the year, however, it had become fairly certain that the already much reduced military mission would peter out early in 1939 through the non-replacement of the officers whose contracts had expired or were shortly expiring. The head of the mission was given the comfort of an assurance that no other Power would be invited to replace his mission. 126. In July two of the more competent Iranian Ministers, for Foreign Affairs and of Education, were summarily dismissed for sending a formal telegram of greeting to the French Minister of Public Instruction on the opening of an exhibition of ancient art which the Shah viewed with disfavour in view of the antiquity of the exhibits. 127. The crowning blow came in December. Shortly after M. Bodard had had a seemingly auspicious interview with the Shah, it was suddenly announced that the Iranian Government had broken off diplomatic relations with France, to the accompaniment of a violent anti-French campaign in the press. The Shah had taken offence at a time-honoured joke in the French press about cats and Shahs; and was more incensed because the French Government had recently introduced a decree dealing with insults to foreign Governments, which they not unnaturally felt unable to apply in the present case. At the end of the year the French Foreign Office were trying to smooth things over and M. Bodard was remaining at his post with this object. Germany. 128. As a result of the operation of the Clearing Agreement the commercial interests of Germany continued to develop in Iran, and this, as mentioned in paragraph 146, was a constant source of irritation to the Government of the U.S.S.R. 129. The Clearing Agreement, however, accumulated such a heavy adverse balance in favour of Germany, amounting to about 27 million reichsmarks, that negotiations were opened in the summer to liquidate this balance and to introduce suitable modifications into the agreement. The greatest secrecy was observed, and numerous stories were current in October that a new agreement had been signed and a substantial payment in sterling made to Germany, with a view to further credits in Iran’s favour. Actually, as was ascertained subsequently from an official source, no new agreement was signed, but modifications were introduced into the existing one. The Shah decided in the autumn that the heavy adverse balance should be liquidated. A substantial payment was made forthwith and it was anticipated that the total amount would bo paid off before the end of March of the following year. No confirmation was obtainable of the report that the reichsmark rate adopted was that of 30 to the pound sterling. 130. The Shah apparently insisted also that a further adverse balance must not be allowed to accumulate, and the revised agreement, to operate as from the following March, was expected to take a form resembling that of a barter agree ment with balances adjusted at regular intervals. 131. During the spring a regular weekly passenger air-service from Berlin to Kabul via Tehran was established by the Lufthansa. This service is also referred to in paragraph 149 of this report. A German bombing plane gave a series of demonstrations in October, at one of which the Shah was present, and it was subsequently reported that the Iranian Government intended to order twelve machines of this type and to send twenty officers and men to Germany for training in the type. The order did not, however, so far as is known, mature. Hungary. 132. In the spring the text was published of the Treaty of Friendship and Arbitration between Iran and Hungary, signed in December 1937. The treat) was ratified by the Majlis on the 16th March. The Trade Agreement, which had \ •*also been signed on the same date, was published in May; it was in the form ©f an exchange of notes. Italy. 133. The Iranian Government were informed in April of the intention of His Majesty’s Government to secure the inclusion in the agenda of the next session of the Council of the League of Nations the question of the consequences arising out of the existing situation in Ethiopia. When this communication was made the Acting Minister for Foreign Afi'airs said that the attitude of Iran had not yet been defined, but he saw no objection to the proposal to clarify the position. He later admitted confidentially that he had explained to the Italian Minister that the Iranian Government could not take up a definite attitude as regards recognition as long as their representative at Geneva was President of the Council. The Iranian Government had, however, entrusted their consul in Rome with the charge of Iranian interests in Ethiopia. 134. In July the new Iranian Minister at Rome was accredited to the King of Italy and Emperor of Ethiopia, the extension of Italian sovereignty over Abyssinia being thus recognised by Iran. 135. In March the Italian sloop Eritrea paid a visit to Khorramshahr, where she was met by the Italian Minister. The behaviour of the officers during this visit was not such as to impress the local inhabitants. J afan. 136. There is little to record under this heading. The developments in China were fairly fully reported in the press, but there was not much comment, and in general it cannot be said that the Iranians have shown any particular interest in the outcome of the conflict. Japanese trade activity diminished during the year, and imports of Japanese goods into Iran decreased steadily. League of Nations. 137. In January the Foreign Office enquired as to what statement the Iranian representative at the forthcoming meeting of the Council of the League of Nations proposed to make on behalf of the signatories of the Saadabad Pact. It transpired that the instructions to be sent related solely to the possibility of a discussion of article 16 of the Covenant. The Iranian Government were opposed to the abolition of this article, and, indeed, were in favour of strengthening it, though in the existing world situation they thought that discussion of the article could do more harm than good. On this question the Iranian delegate, who for this special occasion was the Minister for Foreign Affairs, did, indeed, say, on behalf of all the signatories of the pact, that it was, in their opinion, inopportune to consider for the moment a reform of the Covenant, making particular reference to article 16. Netherlands. 138. According to the Netherlands Minister, representatives of the Royal Dutch oil group were at the end of the year trying to negotiate for a concession in Iran, in areas in which the Russians had formerly been interested, though not on the Russian frontier. The Iranian Government are said to have replied that the time was not opportune. Turkey. 139. The news of the death of the President of the Turkish Republic was received with unusual manifestations of grief. It was immediately announced that the court would go into mourning for a month, and for many days the press, clearly under instructions, concerned itself with little else but the details of the Atatiirk’s career, the significance of his work for Turkey, and the magnitude of the loss suffered as a result of his death. A special delegation was sent to Ankara to attend the funeral, and a special session of the Majlis was held in honour of the late President. There can be no doubt that the Shah felt a very genuine admiration for the Ataturk, and that his efforts to modernise Iran were considerably encouraged and inspired by the Ataturk’s example.140. The above served to illustrate the particularly cordial relations that continued to exist between the two countries throughout the year. As recorded elsewhere in this report, the Turkish Military Attache alone of the foreign military attaches at Tehran was invited to attend the Iranian manoeuvres. United States of America. 141. At the beginning of the year there was still no Iranian diplomatic representative in the United States, the legation having been closed since the incident in which the Iranian Minister was involved in 1935. r I here were signs, however, that the State Department were not going to acquiesce indefinitely in the rather anomalous arrangement under which they continued to maintain a diplomatic representative in Tehran whilst having no Iranian representative in Washington. Opinion in Government circles in Tehran was in favour of reopening the Iranian Legation, but the Shah continued to decline to consider this. Iranian affairs remained in the charge of the Turkish Embassy in Washington. The question was no doubt discussed when Mr. Wallace Murray, head of the Near Eastern Division in the State Department, paid a visit to Tehran in October during the course of a tour through the Near East. In any event, some progress was made at the end of the year by the appointment by the Iranian Government of a charge d’affaires in Washington, though it remained to be seen whether this step would be followed by the reopening of full diplomatic relations. 142. Another matter in which Mr. Murray was interested was the possibility of concluding a commercial treaty between the United States and Iran, a project which the State Department have had in mind for some years. But Mr. Murray was obliged to reach the conclusion that such a treaty was not at present feasible, as the Iranian Government could only consider an agreement upon a basis of barter, a basis which would not be acceptable to the United States. Mr. Murray was received in audience by the Shah during his stay in Tehran. 143. Early in May it was learnt, confidentially, that the United States oil concessionaire companies in Iran and also in Afghanistan were about to renounce their concessions and withdraw from both territories, as was permitted by the terms of the concessions. Notice of renunciation of the Amiranian Oil Company’s concession in Iran was formally given to the Iranian Government on the 12th June, and it is interesting to note the reaction of the Iranian official to whom the notice was handed, who immediately remarked that it was doubtless British influence which had led the company to withdraw. There was, of course, no foundation for such a suggestion. The main reasons for the Amiranian Oil Company’s action appear to have been heavy losses incurred by the parent company in Mexico, which disinclined them to risk further losses in Iran, and the intensive competition from more favourably situated oil-producing areas. To date the Amiranian Oil Company had spent about 2 million dollars in Iran, largely on surveying work— drilling operations had not yet been begun. It seems also that the results of the company’s surveys had not been too encouraging. 144. The impending withdrawal of the company was announced by the Minister of Finance in the Majlis without comment, and the press was obviously also told to refrain from comment. In accordance with the terms of the company’s agreement, copies of all their maps, plans and profiles were handed over to the Iranian Government. The company also turned over copies of numerous geological reports. These are, of course, documents which at some future date may be of considerable value to the Iranian Government. Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. 145. Relations between Iran and the U.S.S.R. were somewhat strained during the year. There were several causes of contention, of which perhaps the principal one was the wholesale expulsion of Iranians from Russia. In February, during a conversacion with His Majesty’s Minister, the Prime Minister said that he anticipated that the total number to be expelled would be some 60,000, and towards the end of the year the Ministry for Foreign Affairs mentioned 40,000 as the approximate number so far expelled. According to the Soviet Ambassador (who incidentally himself mentioned the figure of 10,000), the persons expelled came mainly from the Caucasus, and were, for the most part, small merchants who would not assimilate Soviet ideas of social and commercial27 co-operation in the interest of the State. It seems, indeed, true that the main reason was that these people were regarded as political undesirables in a part of the country about which the Soviet has always been sensitive. At first very little publicity was given in Iran to these expulsions, and the Iranian Government appeared to be taking the line that they welcomed the return of these Iranian nationals and had even invited them to return. Later, however, this attitude was abandoned, and strongly anti-Soviet articles appeared in the press. The victims of the expulsion order were not allowed to bring their properties with them, and many arrived in a state of great misery. Some half million rials were collected on their behalf, mainly through the agency of the Red Lion. It is significant that those expelled were not allowed to take up residence in the larger towns—Tew, if any, reached Tehran. 146. Another reason for the deterioration in Irano-Soviet relations was the undoubted fact that the Soviet Government were much disturbed at the extent of the control that Germany was being allowed to develop over Iranian trade and industry. This may well have been a contributory factor in the decision to make the wholesale expulsions referred to in the preceding paragraph. 147. Resulting from the newly-propounded Soviet theory of parity in the number of consular posts, and the reported decision of the Soviet Government to allow only one Iranian consular post in Russia, the Iranian Government were no longer able to maintain their five posts in Soviet territory, and the Soviet Govern ment, for their part, closed down their offices at Meshed, Kermanshah and Ahwaz, retaining only the post at Pahlevi, which was required for shipping. There was no doubt that the Soviet Consulates in Iran were sources of propaganda for communistic doctrines, and, indeed, they were so regarded—and treated fJ correspondingly—by the Iranian authorities. The latter by no means regretted their departure. At Meshed the Soviet Trade Delegation transferred its residence to the newly-vacated consulate-general. There was some prospect, to a certain extent realised, that a secondary result of the closing of the Russian Consulates would be an improvement in the treatment by the Iranian authorities of His Majesty’s Consulates, since these authorities had tended to judge all consulates after the Russian model. 148. In August the Ministry for Foreign Affairs approached His Majesty’s Minister in connexion with a minor dispute which had arisen with the Soviet Government. A German firm had obtained a contract for work at the port of Pahlavi, which the Soviet Government maintained to be contrary to the terms of their 1927 exchange of notes with the Iranian Government. The Soviet Govern ment made a demonstration by sending warships without notice into territorial waters off Pahlavi—an act against which the Iranian Government promptly protested. There was some indication that the good offices of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom might be requested if the dispute were not settled. The matter, however, blew over without further trouble. 149. In September the Prime Minister informed His Majesty’s Minister that one of the objects of the visit to Geneva of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (he was ostensibly sent as Iranian representative at the session of the Council of the League of Nations) was to get into direct touch with M. Litvinov, in the hope of improving Irano-Soviet relations. The Prime Minister said that the Soviet Government seemed to have persuaded themselves that the Iranian Government had been lending themselves to machinations against Soviet interests—instancing the German air service to Kabul via Iran as part of a plan to reduce Soviet influence in Asia and the German contract for the works at Pahlavi as a threat in the Caspian. The general attitude of the Soviet Government arose, of course, as mentioned in paragraph 146 above, from their hostility to German economic penetration in Iran. The result of the Minister for Foreign Affairs’ talks appears to have been satisfactory; in November he said that he thought the misunder standings which had caused the coolness between the two Governments had been removed—he believed he had convinced M. Litvinoff that the Soviet suspicions had been unfounded, and that Iran meant to adhere to a policy of strict neutrality. Nevertheless, the U.S.S.R. continued to be regarded with suspicion, and the Soviet hidden hand was seen in connexion with the fifty-three persons accused and tried for Communist activities, which is mentioned in paragraph 166 of this report.150. The Iranian Government did not renew their trade agreement of 1935 with the U.S.S.R., which expired on the 20th June. (D) International. The Saadabad Pact. 151. The pact signed on the 8th July, 1937, had been ratified by all four Powers concerned by the summer of 1938. The annual meeting of the so-called Council of the Eastern Entente which was to have been held in Kabul in the spring did not take place, probably on account of the death of the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs, M. Samyi, one of the principal creators of the pact. The meeting of the Assembly of the League of Nations in September provided an opportunity for the Saadabad Council to hold their meeting. 152. The pact did not appear to yield much fruit in 1938, the Hatay dispute causing a certain rift between Turkey and Arab Iraq. But the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs, by giving some support at Geneva and elsewhere to the views of the Iraqi Government on the subject of Palestine, discharged vis-a-vis Iraq the solidarity of foreign policy contemplated in the pact.30 III.— Internal Situation. 154. The Shah paid his usual visits to his Caspian estates, but did not this year make a provincial tour. His one notable sally from Tehran was to fix the last bolt in the permanent way of the Transiranian Railway, at Safid Cheshmeh, near Araq (Sultanabad) on the 26th August. The ceremony of opening the completed line, and witnessing the passage of the first through train from Bandar Shanpour, was attended by a large concourse of notabilities, officials, the Diplomatic Corps and others. 155. The laying of a railway track from the Caspian to the Persian Gulf is hitherto the most spectacular achievement of Reza Shah’s reign, and probably the one nearest his own heart. Whatever may be said about the wisdom of saddling Iran with this expensive undertaking, it is a great accomplishment and a product of the Shah’s own initiative and perseverance. This was a very triumphal day for him. 156. Another event that may be described as a personal success for the Royal Family was the betrothal, announced at the end of May, of the Crown Prince and Princess Fowzieh, sister of the King of Egypt. It typifies not only the fact that the Pahlavi dynasty has “ arrived,” but that it has passed beyond the stage where Royal wives were of so little account that they were drawn from the monarch’s ow r n countrywomen, and no great concern was felt about whence they came, to the stage of the dynastic marriage, a phenomenon hitherto little known in Islamic States. It sets a Royal seal on the emancipation of the Moslem women, officially inaugurated in Iran on the 17th Dey, 1314 (8th January, 1936), a date now annually commemorated by all the country’s organs of publicity. Its future importance may reasonably be expected to include the abolition of those struggles for succession between sons of the same father, but different mothers, the thorn that has rent so much of the fabric of Moslem complication, to set up the pretensions of a rival queen-mother against those of the Egyptian princess. So the marriage is likely to be a support to the dynasty—unless Princess Fowzieh fails to give birth to a male heir. 157. Almost all the foreign Governments represented in Tehran sent messages of congratulation through their representatives, and it was consequently decided that this, together with the great store that the Shah sets by all things touching his own family, justified His Majesty’s Government in breaking the precedent that governmental messages are not sent on such occasions, to the extent of allowing His Majesty’s Charg6 d’Affaires to convey, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, a message of congratulation on behalf of His Majesty the King, which was answered by a telegram from the Shah to His Majesty, transmitted through His Majesty’s Legation. 158. In June an Iranian delegation, headed by the Prime Minister, M. Jam, visited Egypt to make preparatory arrangements for the wedding, which is to take place in 1939. 159. Since by article 37 of the annex to the Constitution the'mother of the heir to the throne must be “of Iranian origin,” an interpreting law was passed at the end of the year, whereby Princess Fowzieh, if granted Iranian nationality by Royal decree before her marriage with the Valiahd, would come within the meaning of this term. 160. The Valiahd thus took a step forward towards the centre of the picture during 1938, but it still cannot be said that there is any outward evidence of his real participation in his father’s deeper counsels. He presided, as the repre sentative of the Royal family, at a dinner given to senior Government officials and senior members of the Diplomatic Corps on the occasion of the Shah’s birthday, the 15th March. 161. The Shah, on the other hand, did a thing unprecedented in the present reign, when he himself gave a dinner party, at which the Queen and Princesses were present, on the occasion of the Crown Prince’s birthday, on the 26th October, to which he invited the heads of all foreign missions and their wives. This did not, however, herald any relaxation of the restrictions on social intercourse between Iranians and foreigners, but was probably a preliminary canter to31 prepare for the international gatherings that are bound to take place at the time of the Valiahd’s wedding. The social boycott continued unchanged in Tehran and the provinces, in spite of the fact that one of the excuses apt to be preferred in defence of it, the presence of Russian consulates, was removed by the closure of all the U.S.S.R.’s provincial consulates during the year, except that at Pahlevi. 162. The Shah’s treatment of his ministers followed established lines. The Foreign Minister, M. Inayatullah Samii, died a natural death in February, following an illness of some weeks’ duration, during and after which the Under secretary, M. Adi, acted in his stead. At the end of May a new Minister was appointed, M. Ali Soheily, till then Minister in London. But his tenure of office was short. In the middle of July M. Hikmat, Minister of Education, rashly sent an appreciative telegram to the French Minister of Public Instruction on the occasion of an exhibition of Persian art at the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris. The Shah disapproved of this exhibition, because the exhibit savoured too much of the old Persia and too little of the new Iran. Fie had not been consulted about the telegram, and, so far as is known, it was in consequence of this, together with an article in LTntransigeant that referred to the Shahinshah’s disapproval of the exhibition, that he summarily dismissed M. Hikmat, who had initiated the telegram, and M. Soheily, who had passed it for despatch. Like the incidents that keep recurring over foreign books and press articles (see paragraph 172), this exemplifies the manner in which the otherwise shrewd Reza allows matters of personal pique to obscure his sense of proportion, and how he puts obedience before competence. M. Hikmat was replaced by a man of inferior calibre, M. Ismail Mirat, and M. Soheily by M. Muzaffar Alam, whose qualifications for his present post are not immediately apparent. 163. Another competent official to incur the Shah’s displeasure and suffer removal was M. Hussein Ala, who was relegated in April to a retirement from which he has not yet emerged. It is true that M. Ala’s previous career had been mainly diplomatic; he possessed no particular training to mark him for a Minister of Commerce, and his abilities would have been put to better use elsewhere; but the reason for his dismissal seems to have been that he tendered unwelcome advice on the subject of putting so much of the country’s commercial activity into the hands of monopoly companies. His work was continued, up to the end of the year, by the Under-Secretary, M. Vassighi, a person who may or may not have been as able, but was certainly more amenable. 164. The fourth Cabinet Minister to be dismissed during 1938 was, as far as a foreigner is given an opportunity to judge, a genuine case of failure to come up to scratch. M. Majid Ahy, Minister of Roads and Communications, was relieved of his duties in November, and remained under what appears to have been house arrest until the end of the year. His fault is understood to have been that he proved adequate to carry out arrangements inherited from his predecessor for the completion of the Bandah Shah-Bandar Shahpur railway, but failed when it came to make further plans for the Tehran-Tabriz line, and allowed the organisation of the road department of his Ministry to deteriorate. 165. On the other hand, M. Ali Mansur, C.B.E., who was arrested when Minister of Roads and Communications in 1936, on charges of misappropriation and incompetence, of which he was later acquitted (see paragraph 245 of annual report for 1936), was restored to favour as Minister of Industry and Mines in August. 166. In 1937 the nation was reminded that no politics deemed “ subversive ” would be tolerated by the crop of arrests alluded to in paragraph 243 of last year’s report. This year another such reminder was more publicly given in November by the lengthy trial, prominently reported in the press, of fifty-three persons accused of communism and having'relations with political groups in the U.S.S.R. 167. 1 orty-five were found guilty, and given sentences of ten years down wards. Only one newspaper gave an account of the defending counsels’ speeches. The defence claimed—quite reasonably, to judge from what was published of the prosecution—that very little hard and independent fact was produced by the prosecutor, nearly all the evidence tendered being of that circular kind wherein one accused makes allegations against a second accused, who in turn makes32 further allegations about a third, and so on. None of the accused were persons of note, and it is probable that their real offence was criticism of the regime. 168. Flimsy as the proceedings were by western standards, they were an advance upon methods employed in the past. From the moment that the light of court procedure and press publicity shone upon the affair, everyone felt that nothing like a death or a life sentence would be passed; for when anything really dangerous is afoot, the most silent methods are used. 169. The reorganisation of provincial administration, mentioned in paragraph 248 of the annual report for 1937, began to come into operation, but by the end of the year it could not be said to have been entirely put into effect. The new system divides the country into ten divisions (“ Ustans ”), which are sub-divided into an aggregate of forty-nine departments (“ Shahristans ”). Further sub-divisions, in descending order, are the district (“ Bakhsh ”), the sub-district (“ Dehistan ”), and the township (“ Qasabeh ”) or village (“ Deh ”). The official in charge of the division (“ Ustandar ”) was designed by the law to be peripatetic, without fixed seat of Government, more or less an inspector. The ruler of the department (the “ Farmandar ”) obviously corresponded closely with the previous Provincial Governor. It has not yet been possible to make a general test of how the relations between Ustandar and Farmandar are turning out in practice, for reports vary. In places where there was previously a Governorate-General, the Governor- General has usually become the Farmandar of the “home” Shahristan, and again has usually, but not always, retained his subordinate office in the old Governorate-General, and therefore probably also the very direct subordination of his authority to that of the Ustandar. Where a Farmandar is the heir of a provincial Governor, who previously had no intermediary between himself and the Ministry of Interior, but is now grouped as one of a number of Farmandars in an Ustan, his relations with the Ustandar are not yet so clear. And in several cases Ustandars have not yet been appointed, so that everything, except in name, must be moving much as before. 170. Another innovation of the new system is the introduction of a Shahristan Council under the Farmandar’s presidency, composed of the heads of all Government departments in the unit, and a Bakhsh Council, containing not only the corresponding heads of departments, but elected representatives of landowners and cultivators. If the existence of these councils leads to more local co-operation among the provincial representatives of various ministries, who hitherto have referred even the most trivial matters back to their principals in Tehran, a very welcome reform will have been effected. At present there is no general evidence that this has occurred. Shahristan and Bakhsh Councils have not yet everywhere been formed, and, where they have, they are not yet recorded to have effected much, except in the outlying Shahristans of the Ustan, whose centre is Shiraz. One of the principal duties provided for them, that of concerting measures for agricultural reform, has in only one region (Kermanshah) been reported to have received much attention. 171. It cannot be said that any striking new turn was taken during 1938 as regards the planned economic development of the country. The administrative system remained in a state of transition; the exploitation of mineral wealth continued to be planned, but no notable project was undertaken; further regula tions for dealing with agriculture were issued, but no remarkable change in existing conditions was reported. The process of commercial jugglery that rules the economic system continued as before, but the machine seemed to jog along somehow without giving serious signs of breaking down. No ideas of retrench ment resulted from the achievement of the Transiranian Railway; on the contrary, the Government immediately set to work allotting contracts for the Tabriz line. The cost of living continued to rise slowly, and the authorities turned their attention to one of the gravest aspects of this problem by bringing in legislation (not enforced by the end of the year) to control rents; but no unusual destitution seems to have occurred, and the effect of controlling rents, though it may bring relief to a section of the population that is hard pressed and deserves it, will be offset by the fact that, with the currency so artificially valued and so precarious in stability, the purchase of foreign exchange virtually impossible, and commerce so susceptible to arbitrary control, real estate is the one attractive form33 of investment. However, the Iranians seem to have a talent for avoiding the Nemesis that in a more delicately organised community would long ago have brought them to ruin. It cannot be said that any improvement has taken place in the low standard of official probity to which allusion was made in para graph 250 of the annual report for 1937. In particular, the situation in Ears, after the effect of last year’s revelations had worn off, quickly relapsed, and further scandals were reported from Khuzistan. 172. Not a year now passes without its crop of press incidents (see paragraph 245 of the annual report for 1937). During 1938 the press of England, France, Switzerland, Germany and the U.S.S.R. all contrived to occasion outbursts in the Tehran papers, which is all the more remarkable in view of the fact that in two of those countries the press is under strict political control. The truth is that an article which to a European editor would appear perfectly anodyne, such as a casual correspondent’s account of his travels, may fire the train, if it deals with Iran in terms inconsistent with the tone of the Iranian press, which is of a sycophancy such that an unacquainted reader, seeing an Iranian article on Iran, might be in honest doubt whether it were serious. The Shah takes no account of motive, with quite anomalous results. For instance, a violent anti-British storm in the whole local press in January was apparently caused (only the cause was never mentioned) by an obscure and silly, but not ill-intentioned, paragraph about the Shah in Everybody's Weekly, which, as if to demonstrate how well informed it was, was printed under a photograph of the late Ahmed Shah (perhaps this was an additional irritant); whereas an article in the American paper Time of the 25th April, which ran to two pages, trod on several well-known corns, and contained some intentionally acid criticisms, occasioned no protest at all, partly because the United States Charge d’Affaires was able to deprecate their wrath before the Iranian Government had received the article, but also, it is surmised, because the blow was too paralysing to beget speech. It is the little things that sting. 173. Naturally the countries with unmuzzled presses run the greatest risks of displeasing the Shah, but few can have anticipated that the recurrence in the Paris press of the old pun about “ Sa Majeste le Chat ” on the occasion of the annual Cat Show would have driven him to the length of breaking off diplomatic relations with France (see paragraph 127). Sensitive as the Shah is, it may be doubted whether, but for his knowledge that democratic countries are usually sweetly reasonable, his opinion that France is in a vacillating and weak condition, and the fact that Iran relies on no vital import or export trade with France, his annoyance would have taken quite this form. 174. Where domestic subjects were not concerned the Iranian press main tained as careful a balance of impartiality as could be expected. All foreign news reaches the press through the bulletins of the Agence Pars, controlled by the Ministries for Foreign Affairs, Interior and Education, whose foreign policy appears to be avoidance of any excuse for embroilment by publishing a rather indigestible patchwork of items derived all round from the news services with whose copy it is regularly supplied, including the British Official News, Reuters, Havas, the D.N.B. and Anatolia. The insistence on the Agence Pars’s monopoly in this matter, which led to the incident described in paragraph 106 (British Official News), seemed to be guided, not by hostility to the British Official News but by the desire to give no excuse for discrimination of news from other more tendentious sources. During the Austrian crisis in the spring more news of German than other origin appeared, but it cannot be said that anything specifically hostile to other Powers was published, and the reason was doubtless that the Germans were at that time making most of the news. During the Czecho-Slovak crisis in the autumn, on the other hand, although the Agence Pars’s foreign news bulletins contained a large amount of matter from^both sides, the articles on foreign affairs that appeared in the vernacular papers, copied almost invariably from some European or American publication, were very nearly all of French, Swiss, Belgian, English or American origin. No articles containing anything very partial or controversial were reproduced; the paramount reason for this choice of sources appears to be that the ’ local journalist is more often acquainted with French or English than with German or Italian.34 175. Though public policy was to be impartial, even dumb, concerning Czecho-Slovakia and the risk of a European war, the views privately expressed by Iranian officials at the time, and later by His Imperial Majesty in an audience granted to His Majesty’s Minister, indicated approval of Mr. Chamberlain’s ell'orts to preserve peace, and of the policy of His Majesty’s Government. It could hardly be expected the Shah or an Iranian official would express contrary opinions, if they held them, to British representatives; nevertheless, probability favours the view that the Iranian Government would disapprove of an expansive European Power, known to be bent on having colonies, and would dislike a war that would cut off the imports with which they cannot yet dispense. It may be conjectured, also, that the undoubtedly pro-British attitude adopted by the late Kemal Atatiirk, of whose work he is a warm admirer, would weigh heavily with the Shah. 176. The controversial question affecting His Majesty’s Government which would be most likely to interest Iran is that of Palestine. Here the Iranian Govern ment seem to have been careful to avoid giving offence. The “ straight ” news provided by the British Official News has been fully reproduced; only one flagrantly incorrect item, culled from the Syrian press and not of any special significance, was noticed during the year, in particular none of the aspersions cast in the totalitarian presses on the conduct of the British forces have been mentioned. On the other hand, the Iranian press ventured no comment of its own, except once, when a leading article appeared in Ittalaat giving quite a reasonable historical summary of the Palestine question, confined mainly to objective statements and avoiding controversial issues. 177. The Zionist problem in Palestine does not really interest the Iranians for its own sake. The feeling of Muslim solidarity between Persian and Arab is very superficial, and the considerable Jewish colonies that have been settled for centuries in such towns as Hamadan are much more Iranian than the Arabs of south-western Iran. Nevertheless, in their present mood of “ Gleichschaltung,” the Iranian Government do not overlook that Iranian Jews, like Iranian Armenians, Assyrians, Bahais and similar minorities possess a community- loyalty that may on occasion compete with the infant national sense whose growth they are forcing. In the case especially of Jews and Armenians, this slight distrust is enhanced by less avowed considerations of vested interest. Jews are, here as elsewhere, very successfully entrenched in the clerical and accounting professions; Armenians, too, have a large share in these occupations, especially with foreign firms who pay well, like the A.I.O.C., as they generally know all the local languages, such as Turki, and many are well acquainted with Russian, French and English; and Armenians and Assyrians, being among the few Iranians possessing mechanical sense, overrun the motoring and mechanical trades. Thus a certain jealousy is aroused in the ordinary Persian, harassed as he is by the rising cost of living, and the feeling is given poignancy in the case of the Jews by the belief that they frequently manage to evade the exchange restrictions. This probably accounts for the fact that firms such as the A.I.O.C. have been told that they are not expected to maintain a stipulated ratio between the numbers of Muslims, Jews and Christians they employ, and for the abortive project, mentioned in paragraph 116, to expel a number of Iraqi Jews. Rumours have also been current of plans to remove local Jews from frontier districts. So far, however, no positive and general anti-Jewish measures are known to have been taken. 178. The Iranian Academy (“ Farhangistan ”) somewhat increased their output of “ pure Persian ” words, to be obligatory in official, and commendable in other use. But it has been noticed that, whereas lists of new words appear from time to time in the local press as products of the academy, the official notifications that subsequently appear in the Ministry of Justice Gazette hardly ever contain all those previously announced. This, together with several inspired newspaper articles ridiculing the wrong and indiscriminate use of new terms and a circular to all officials forbidding the use of new terms not sanctioned in the usual manner, indicates that it has been realised that this is a matter requiring a certain restraint. Official promulgation was given to new names for all ministries, many items of the office vocabulary of the civil and diplomatic services (e.g., minute, retirement, fees, secretary, protocol, &amp;c.), many legal words {e.g., court, judge,'6b witness, arbitrator, crime, petition, &amp;c.), and—n thing which forms an interesting comment on what is regarded as a strictly official matter— a whole vocabulary of boy-scouting terms. 1/9. ihe suppression of the use, for public and business purposes, of any but the Persian language and character, mentioned in paragraph 253 of the annual report for 1937, came into legal force as from the Persian New Year, the 21st March, 1938. Hitherto foreign firms and institutions have managed to avoid any major inconvenience by keeping certain essential account books, relating to internal transactions, and their internal business correspondence, in Persian. As the bulk of their internal correspondence was, in any case, addressed to Iranians, it was already mainly conducted in that language. Since the application of the law, most of their correspondence addressed tt&gt; other foreign parties within the country has been put into Persian, since otherwise there would be complications if it had to be produced in evidence in a local court of law. 180. It should be remembered, when judging the nationalism of the Iranian Government in this matter, that Latin script, though the most important, is not the only alien character with which they are dealing. Leaving aside the facts that Iraqi Jewish traders in Iran frequently keep their accounts in the Arabic language written in the Hebrew character (which means, in practice, that no one but a Jew, and probably an Arabic-speaking Jew, can investigate the books of, say, a bankrupt), and that Indian traders in Iran use Indian scripts among themselves, the Cyrillic, Armenian and Syriac alphabets have been in habitual use amongst Armenians, ex-Russians, Chaldeans and Assyrians, who are Iranian nationals. This being so, the insistence on Persian script may fairly be regarded as coming within the scope of the Iranian Government’s measures for breaking down sectionalism, and fostering a common national spirit among their subjects. Tribes. 181. Tribal resistance to the Government’s policy of regimentation and settlement is growing more local and sporadic. The causes of such dissidence as manifested itself in 1938 are mainly social and economic, and are summarised in paragraph 257 of the annual report for 1937. Disturbances were threatened in the districts of the Bashagird (east of the Strait of Hormuz) and the Boir Ahmadi, but the despatch of troops was in each case sufficient to forestall any trouble of consequence (see paragraph 206). The only resistance of any note with which the Government had to deal during the year was that of the Bahmai and the Izmailzais (see paragraphs 276 and 279-280 of the annual report for 1937). The Bahmai episode was finished off by the familiar method of treacherously inducing the leaders to come in, and then shooting them, after they had been blockaded through the winter of 1937-38. The Izmailais were dealt with towards the close of the year by operations which are described in paragraphs 206 and 207 of this report. Civil Aviation. 182. The Iranian air service, whose inauguration was recorded in para graph 261 of the annual report for 1937, was opened to passengers as well as mail during 1938, and in March the terminus of the service was extended from Kermanshah to Bagdad. This weekly service, taking approximately four hours for the journey Tehran-Kermanshah-Bagdad and vice versa, continued to operate with reasonable regularity for the rest of the year. It continued to be maintained by British De Havilland machines, tended in Tehran by a British mechanic. Later in the year there was talk of an Iraqi service in addition, but this did not materialise; and there is reason for supposing that the Iranian Government would resist the intrusion of a competitor, as they did in the case of the Lufthansa. 183. As from the 5th April a regular passenger service, weekly in each direction, between Berlin and Tehran, via Belgrade, Athens, Rhodes, Damascus and Bagdad, and an irregular extension to Kabul, was inaugurated by the German Lufthansa Company. It seems doubtful whether any written agreement with the Iranian Government was negotiated, but the service operated regularly for the remainder of the year. A maximum of four passengers could be carried in each aeroplane, the time taken on the outward journey from Berlin to Tehran was just over 30 hours, and on the inward journey 27 hours, the fares being36 850 reichsmarks, or 5,480 rials, Iranian currency being accepted for bookings fi om Tehran. To prevent competition with the Iranian air service, no passengei bookings between Tehran and Bagdad were allowed: as regards mail, outwaid mail from Tehran had to be sent by Iranian service as far as Bagdad, where mail for the United Kingdom was transferred to Imperial Airways, and that for westward destinations on the Lufthansa route to the Lufthansa, whose machine for the greater part of the year left Tehran on the same day as the Iranian service. As far as is known, a certain amount of inward mail from Berlin was brought direct to Tehran by Lufthansa. IV. —Military Affairs. The Army. General. 184. This year the General Staff have given serious consideration firstly to the complete reorganisation of the system of supply and maintenance (“ Service de VIntendance ”) of the army, and secondly to the preparation of war defence plans. The defence of the Persian Gulf ports and of opposing a subsequent advance inland has been carefully studied as also the siting of defence works on the frontiers of Iran generally. 185. Fair progress has been made in tactical training throughout the army especially among infantry and cavalry units. The artillery arm still, however, lags behind both in practical training and tactics. Throughout there is still an entire lack of co-ordination between arms and co-operation between units of the same arm. 186. In spite, however, of the progress made, and the large sums expended on modern war material, the Iranian army would still be of little value in war and no appreciable improvement can be looked for in the near future. Further progress could undoubtedly be made if the Iranian Government would continue to avail itself of the services of foreign military missions and technical advisers, but it is proposed to dispense with these expensive and humiliating encumbrances as early as possible. This is fully in keeping with Iranian national conceit which remains an obstacle to the attainment of practical efficiency. Expenditure. 187. In the estimates for the Iranian year 1317 (21st March, 1938, to the 20th March, 1939), the credit provided for the Ministry of War is 392,071,956 rials or about £4,900,899 at the present rates. This sum includes provision for the navy and air force, for which no separate heads are shown. It represents an increase over last year’s figures of 82,163,576 rials (£1,027,044). 1,150,500 rials (£14,381) has been provided for expenses in connexion with conscription, an increase of 750,500 rials (£9,375) over last year’s figure. For the road and frontier guards (Amnieh) department 30,678,400 rials (£383,480). 188. An additional sum of 9 million rials (£112,500) has been voted for the construction of a gas mask factory in the vicinity of Tehran. 189. The extra grant of £2 million from Government reserves which was omitted from last year’s budget allotment was, however, again voted this year. 190. The grand total for military expenditure is therefore in the neigh bourhood of £7 million, or approximately 26 per cent, of the total budgeted expenditure of the country. Strength. 191. The strength of the Iranian army as estimated on the 1st June, 1938, was 105,702 all ranks. This figure is virtually the same as last year. Little further increase is probable beyond bringing formations, especially the artillery and armoured fighting vehicles arms, up to a uniform establishment. Further expansion of the air force is, however, envisaged.37 192. Ihere is still a serious shortage of officers on the active list. In the artillery arm the deficiency is about 40 per cent, and in the infantry 15 to 20 per cent. Organisation. 193. The only major change this year is the abolition of the cavalry divisions and the attachment of its four regiments equally to the 1st and 2nd ‘ Infantry Divisions. 194. The Iranian army now consists of nine divisions and six independent composite brigades, distributed as under 1st Division : Tehran. 2nd „ : Tehran. 3rd „ : Western Azerbaijan. 4th „ : Eastern Azerbaijan. 5th ,, : Senneh. 6th ,, : Khuzistan. 7th „ : Ears. 8th „ : Mekran. 9th „ : Khorasan. Independent Composite Brigade : Gilan. „ „ „ : Mazanderan. ,, „ „ : Gurgan (Asterabad). „ „ „ : Kermanshah. „ ,, „ : Isfahan. „ „ : Kerman. 195. An interesting innovation is the creation firstly of a Council of National Defence with His Imperial Majesty as president, all Cabinet Ministers and the Chief of the General Staff as members and secondly, an Army Council with the War Minister as president, the Under-Secretary of War, the Chief of the General Staff, the Air Officer Commanding and six other General Officers as members. A rmaments. 196. Rifles.\ —The army has been completely rearmed with the Brno (Czecho-Slovak) 7-9 mm. (• 310-in.) rifle. Reserve stocks of this pattern rifle delivered, and on order, amount to 400,000. This is extraordinary. 197. Mortars. —Units of the 1st and 2nd Divisions (Tehran Garrison) have been issued with 80 Stokes-Brandt mortars, 81 mm. (3-Sl-in.). This mortar is a close support weapon and fires a 7-lb. shell to a maximum range of 3,300 yards. 198. A rtillery. —Anti-aircraft guns in use and on order are the latest type of Bofors 75-mm. (2-95-in.). All obsolete field and mountain guns are gradually being replaced by Skodas 105-mm. and Bofors 75-mm. mountain guns. 199. Anti-tank guns (Skodas) have been supplied to infantry regiments of the 1st and 2nd Divisions at four guns per regiment. Higher Command and Appointments. 200. Sartip (Brigadier) Ahmed Nakhchevan, an air force officer on the active list, continues to act as Minister of War. 201. Sar Lashgar (Major-General) Azizullah Zarghami remains Acting Chief of the General Staff. Reviews and Parades. 202. The annual military review held on the anniversary of the coup d’Rtat took place on the Jalalieh parade ground on the 22nd February. Including civilian elements (boy scouts, girl guides and cadets of the military schools), approximately 30,000 were on parade. Sixty-five aeroplanes flew past in formation. Fifty light and fifty medium tanks were also driven past in review. The parade was similar to that of last year, but showed improvement in drill and turn-out.Manoeuvres. 203. The annual manoeuvres of the Tehran garrison were held fiom the 11th to the 14th September, 1938, immediately after the collective training season. The number of troops engaged was only about 12,000, owing o e European situation and the reinforcement of the Irano-Soviet non ici y &amp; regiment drawn from the 1st Division. The manoeuvres were held m the \ieim y of Veramin, about 30 miles south-east of Tehran, and were directed by Sar Lashgar (Major-General) Yazdan Panah, the chief umpire being Sai ang (Colonel) Arfa. Sar Lashgar (Major-General) Shahbakhti, General Officer Commanding, Tabriz Division, and the General Officer Commanding, Isfahan Independent Brigade, were in command of the opposing forces. 204. Operations commenced daily at sunrise and were broken off at sunset. There was little scope for boldness or initiative, as the troops were kept rigidly to fixed boundaries and the programme appointed for the day. A mechanised column and aircraft participated. 205. His Imperial Majesty the Shah was present on all three days, as also were divisional and independent brigade commanders, with their Chiefs of Staff. The Turkish Military Attache was the only military attache invited to attend the manoeuvres. No accounts were published in the press. As usual, a number of taxis and lorries were commandeered for some days. Military Operations. 206. The year 1938 has been one of comparative tranquillity for the Iranian Government in their dealings with the tribes. Several minor operations h&amp;yc, however, been carried out and the Government have at last been partially successful in subduing the Ismailzais in Iranian Baluchistan. Kurdistan. —The Kurds have been on the whole quiet. The usual petty skirmishes with both Iraqi and Kurdish bandits have taken place. Bashagird. —In January, owing to the truculent attitude of this tribe, a small punitive force of about 1,500 of all arms, under the command of Sartip (Brigadier) Siahpush, General Officer Commanding, Kerman Independent Brigade, embarked at Bandar Abbas on the Iranian sloops Babr and Shahrukh and were disembarked on the coastline near Bandar Sirik. Other small columns drawn from Kerman, Minab and Mekran co-operated in blockading the area, which is 30 to 40 miles north-east of Minab. The rebels offered little or no resistance, and the ringleaders, including Abdul Hussein Kameran, were captured, together with about 200 old but serviceable rifles. This operation is interesting, as it is the first time in which combined naval and military operations have been undertaken. The sloops, in addition to transporting the troops to the sphere of operations, were also utilised for the conveyance of supplies. Boir Ahmadi. —Isolated, but increasing acts of banditry were reported from this area in July, in consequence a small force was despatched from Shiraz and Behbehan respectively to the difficult mountainous district of Shulistan. The operations were carried out efficiently and with great secrecy, all movements of troops being made at night and along the new military roads recently constructed in that area. The tribesmen were caught between the two columns and the ring leaders captured. A small permanent garrison has now been established at Tal-i-Khosrovi, which is situated in the centre of this troublesome area. Iranian Baluchistan. —The major success of the year has undoubtedly been the breaking up of the Ismailzai resistance in Iranian Baluchistan. Sirdar Juma Khan Ismailzai has been for years a thorn in the side of the Iranian authorities. The Mekran authorities have made repeated efforts to bring him “ to heel,” but without success. In mid-November, however, an opportunity occurred for his capture, and a mixed force of about 3,500 troops of all arms, including Amnieh (road guards) and local Baluchi levies, were assembled at Zahidan and were moved by motor transport to near where Juma Khan was reported to be in camp. A number of troops simultaneously moved from Zabul, Khwash and Bam and completed a cordon round the area. Juma Khan was taken completely by surprise, but managed to retire into the neighbouring hills, where he put up a stout resistance for over a week. Supplies, however, running short, Juma Khan was forced to evacuate his position. He escaped through the cordon without39 difficulty and crossed the frontier with over 100 of his followers into British territory at Piran, north of Zahidan, where they were disarmed and sent under escort to Nushki. 207. There is good reason to believe that the Ismailzais lost about fifteen killed and wounded and the military force at least sixty dead and injured. Most of these casualties occurred among the Amnieh (road guards), who bore the brunt of the attack. 208. A new Sirdar Nazar Muhammad has been appointed and has promised to work in close co-operation with the authorities and has agreed to surrender all arms held by his tribe. 209. Juma Khan’s successful retirement to British territory has brought about strained relations between the Governor of Mekran and the Divisional Commander, Sar Lashgar (Major-General) Mahmud Amini. Each alleges that the defective arrangements of the other facilitated the escape of the Ismailzai chief. 210. However, this sudden action by the military authorities, in spite of its failure to achieve its main object, the capture of Juma Khan himself, cannot but enhance the prestige of the Government in Iranian Baluchistan and will conduce to the pacification of this long-disturbed area. 211. The Iranian authorities still appear to regard Juma Khan Ismailzai as a source of danger; even though he is far removed from the border and under surveillance, they fear that he will organise raids in Iranian Mekran and are therefore taking necessary precautions. Conscription. 212. Conscription continues to work smoothly and quotas have been coming in regularly. Still further extensions of conscription have been made among certain sections of Kurds, Qashgais, Bakhtiari and Baluchi tribesmen. The benefit of a period of military service is already beginning to show itself amongst those who have returned to civilian life, both physically and mentally the difference is most marked. 213. In June a new conscription law was passed by the Majlis. The law makes it much harder to obtain exemption from military service. The duties and procedure of recruiting committees have been carefully laid down which was not the case in the previous law of 1931. Conscript service is divided as follows :— Two years with the colours at the age of 21. Four years in the reserve, during the last of which the reservist carries out one month’s training. Fourteen years in the 1st supplementary reserve during which he does six periods of one month’s training. Five years in the 2nd supplementary reserve. 214. The regular calling up and training of reservists has commenced. This year those reservists who left the colours in 1928 and who should have completed their first period of reserve training in 1932 were called up for training. 215. In view of the paucity of officers and n.c.o. instructors the problem of making up such arrears in reservists training is formidable. Staff College and Military A cademy. 216. The young officer graduates from the Staff College (“ Fcole Superieure de Guerre ”) are good material and both keen and intelligent. It will, however, take years before they can make their influence felt against the idleness and conservative obstinacy of their superiors, especially in provincial formations. 217. In the Military Academy (“ Fcole de Guerre ”) in Tehran, His Royal Highness the Crown Prince concluded his two years’ studies. He has emerged with all honours that were available. He was placed first in his particular year and together with the other successful candidates received his commission as a second lieutenant from His Imperial Majesty the Shah at the annual ‘ ‘ passing out ’ ’ ceremony. KjtjdS A 1 ^ 1' 40 European Crisis. !218. The crisis was followed with intense interest in Tehran, almost as much by the Iranians as by the large foreign community. Apart from Russians, Germans and Czechs comprise by far the largest proportion of the foreign community. 219. That the Iranian Government were prepared for eventualities is known, as two squadrons of aircraft of No. 1 Aviation Regiment were standing by prepared to move to Khuzistan (oilfields area) in the event of hostilities breaking out. Certain other units also of the Tehran garrison were detailed to move for the protection of the oilfields and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s plant against possible sabotage or attack. 220. Strict orders had been given to police authorities to arrest all foreigners suspected of plotting activities incompatible with Iranian neutrality. The French Military Mission. 221. The French Military Mission, which consisted of fifteen officers in 1936, has been reduced to four officers; their names are :— Colonel Henriet. Colonel Pechaud Chalret du Rieu. Commandant Vicomte de la Moussaye. Commandant Massonee. 222. The contracts of these officers expire in 1939 and so far the Iranian Government has not applied for fresh officers to take their place, and it is said that it does not intend to do so. If this is correct it will not be unfair to deduce that the rate of improvement in efficiency of the army is going to be very slow if indeed positive deterioration can be avoided. General de Division Gendre, after handing over his duties as chief of the mission in June, was appointed adviser on frontier defences pending his return to France in September. Accom panied by a number of Iranian Staff Officers, General Gendre visited all the frontiers in Iran in turn. This caused some alarmist comment in Iraq, which was reported to the Shah. 223. A staff exercise for students of the staff college and others supervised by the French Military Mission was carried out last year and again this year to study the problems of the defence of the Persian Gulf ports and of opposing sub sequent advances inland. Colleagues. 224. Japanese. —Lieutenant-Colonel H. Fukuti was recalled to Japan for service in China in September. He has been succeeded by Lieutenant-Colonel Tomo Takasima of the Imperial Japanese Air Force. 225. French. —Chef de Escadron Robert Leleu proceeded on his annual short leave during the autumn. He leaves early in January 1939, and is being succeeded by Chef de Bataillon Alessandri. Commandant Leleu during his time in Tehran has been a most friendly, helpful and loyal colleague. 226. Italian. —Capitano di Fregata Luciano Bigi left Tehran in December on completion of his tenure of appointment. He has been succeeded by Capitano di Corvietta Luigi Mola. 227. Turkish. Capitaine d Etat Major Jelal Orge returned to Turkey on completion of his tenure of appointment in Iran in September. He has been succeeded by Capitaine d’Etat Major Kemal Sanjak from Istanbul, who is a friendly and helpful colleague. ^ 228. Russia. —No Russian Military Attach^ has been appointed in the place of Colonel Absolamoff, who was recalled to Moscow in August 1937. 229. German. Colonel Hans Rohde, stationed at Angora and accredited to Athens and I ehran, arrived on a short visit in September. During his stay Colonel Rohde paid a surprise visit to Kabul by Lufthansa Airways, and on leturn announced that he had obtained valuable orders for German war material from the Afghan Government.41 Visit to Troops. 230. lor the first time for many years the British Military Attache was invited to see a unit of the Iranian army, the unit selected was the 1st (Pahlavi) Cavalry Regiment. The interior economy of this unit was of a high standard. Language Students. 231. The following officers arrived in Iran during 1938 on a year’s language duty at Tehran and Shiraz respectively:— Major J. B. Cunningham, Royal Indian Army Service Corps. Lieutenant P. G. B. McNalty, 2nd Royal Lancers. Travellers—British and Indian Officers. 232. The following officers visited Iran, most of them in transit from India to Europe and vice versa during 1938 :— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Oliver W. H. Leese Bt., D.S.O., the Coldstream Guards, and Lady Leese. Major H. W. Farrell, Indian Medical Service, and Mrs. Farrell. Major W. A. Fausset, 7th Light Battery, Royal Artillery, and Mrs. Fausset. Major E. H. Gastrell, O.B.E., Indian Army, and Mrs. Gastrell. Major B. M. Rao, Indian Medical Corps, and Mrs. Rao. Captain C. V. Griffin, Royal Engineers. Lieutenant G. W. M. Kendrick, 2nd Battalion the South Staffordshire Regiment. Lieutenant H. M. Siddiq Choudri, Royal Indian Navy. The Iranian Air Force. Aircraft. 233. The past year has seen the order placed with the Hawker Aircraft Company, (Limited), for thirty-five cc Hind ” machines, completed. The Iranian aircraft factory produced five machines each of the “ Audax ” and “Tiger- Moth ” types, so that the total number of machines now in possession of the Iranian air force, excluding one machine which has been written off, is 198. This is an increase of forty-four over the total for 1937. The description of these machines is as follows. Aircraft. De Havilland “ Tiger-Moth ” De Havilland 9 &gt; Russian built) unserviceable Hawker “ Audax ” and “ Fury ”.... Hawker “ Hind ” .... Junkers (Type W. 33) un serviceable Russian R. 5 (Type M. 17) un serviceable Engine. Number “Gipsy-III” and “Gipsy-Major” 66 “Liberty” 6 Pratt and Whitney and Bristol “ Pegasus ” 79 Bristol “ Pegasus ” 35 “ B.M.W.” 2 “ B.M.W.” 10 234. In addition to the above aircraft, the following machines are also in possession of the Iranian air force, but not on its charge. Aircraft. Engine. Number. De Havilland “ Rapide ”.... .... “ Gipsy-IV ” 3 Prage Sports Model (two-seater) 1 Curtiss “ Hawk ” .... .... .... Wright “ Whirlwind ” .... .... 1 Aircraft factory. 235. His Imperial Majesty the Shah, accompanied by the Crown Prince, visited the Iranian aircraft factory of Shahbaz at Doshantappeh on two occasions to inspect five machines of the “ Audax ” type and five of the “ Tiger-Moth ” type, the fuselages and airframes of which had been constructed at the factory during the past year.42 236. Demonstrations were given on each occasion by the machines in formation flying by Sarwan (Captain) Afghami, chief test pilot of the Iranian air force and four sergeant pilots. Afterwards the Shah expressed his pleasure both to Sarhang (Colonel) Khosrovani, Air Officer Commanding, and Sarwan (Captain) Afghami. 237. A British eye-witness states that the performance was carried out with skill and reflects great credit on the progress made by pilots of the Iranian air force. 238. Care was taken to ensure that none of the British mechanics appeared in photographs published in the press and no mention was made of their presence. 239. The services of Squadron-Leader F. Workman were dispensed with in August, no reason being given for his dismissal. The duties of technical adviser now devolve on Mr. F. Knight. 240. Generally affairs at the aircraft factory are far from being satis factory, and the British personnel are finding it increasingly difficult to carry on. 241. A very ambitious programme for the enlargement of the factory and the mass production of the “Hind” type of aircraft, besides “ Audax ” machines, is being planned. This the British staff consider impossible owing to the lack of experienced mechanics, &amp;c., necessary for such an undertaking. Courses of Instruction. 242. Pilots of the Iranian air force are now receiving training in air navigation. This is a subject of which the large majority are totally ignorant. 243. Night flying has been carried out on one or two occasions, but pilots are not normally trained to take off and land in the dark. During August an order was placed in Germany for the supply of an unknown number of vehicles fitted with searchlight equipment for flood lighting aerodromes at night. It is understood that a small number of these vehicles have already arrived. Casualties. 244. The number of accidents to aircraft this year has been considerably reduced. The most serious occurred on the 13th November when a Hawker “ Audax ” aeroplane crashed from a considerable height in the Elburz mountains north of Tehran. The pilot and observer were killed and the machine totally wrecked. Foreign Air Missions. 245. The contract of Colonel Bever, Belgian adviser to the Iranian air force terminated in May when he left for Belgium. The Iranian Government do not intend to replace him. Aerodromes and Landing Grounds. 246. Landing grounds are being constructed at Qum and Dilijan, south-east of Qum. Repairs and releveling have been carried out on the military landing grounds at Senneh and Mussik (Merivan). 247. The construction of the aerodrome at Tabriz has been completed. Four hangars have been erected as also have barracks and office buildings. It is the intention of the Iranian Government to permanently station a squadron of aircraft at Tabriz early in 1939. 248. The air-port at Bushire is being considerably enlarged. Visit of Iranian Air Force Officers to Europe. 249. Sarwans (Captains) Mehdi Sipahpur and Abdul Husain Mostafavi left Tehran in January for Europe in order to test the “ Hind ” aircraft which had been ordered from the Hawker aircraft factory. Thirty-five of this type of aircraft have arrived at Ahwaz and are being assembled by British mechanics. After undergoing the usual tests the machines will be handed over to the Iranian air force and flown to Tehran. Seventeen of these machines have already arrived in Tehran.43 C* C f&gt; O \ 250. In November these officers visited both Germany and Italy to inspect J bombing aircraft. The Italian Government offered to supply twin-engine bombers which they guaranteed to deliver within six weeks of receipt of an order, complete with equipment and guns. Payment was to be 50 per cent, in pounds pr dollar^, the balance in Iranian goods. The Italian Government also offered facilities~for the training of pilots and mechanics. The Iranian Navy. Strength. 251. Since the Iranian navy came into being in 1932 it has increased in strength from 2 sloops and 4 patrol vessels to 2 sloops, 5 patrol vessels, 1 tug, 3 vedettes and a Royal yacht, the names of which are as follows :— Based on the Persian Gulf— Sloops— Bahr. Palang. Patrol vessels— Karkas. Simurgh. Shahbas. Shah in. Shahokh. Tugs— Niru. Based on Caspian Sea— Vedettes— Deh Nau. Makhsus. Nihang. Royal yacht— Shahsowar. Foreign Visits. 252. The Italian sloop Eritrea arrived at Khorramshahr on the 2nd March and left on the 19th. The vessel fired a salute of twenty-one guns on arrival, to which the Iranian sloop Babr replied. Courtesy visits were exchanged between the Italian naval commander, the Governor of Abadan and the Iranian naval authorities. Repairs. 253. The patrol vessel Shahin, which has been out of commission for some considerable time has undergone extensive overhaul by Italian engineers and has again been commissioned. Gendarmerie. 254. There is nothing to report of this organisation. loFT JL * • PERSIA 1368 February 10, 1940. CONFIDENTIAL. 1940 j Section 2. (15824) [E 584/584/34] Copy No. Sir R. Bullard to Viscount Halifax.—(Received February 10.) My Lord. Tehran. January 17, 1940. IN accordance with the instructions contained in your Lordship’s circular despatch of the 4th November last, I have the honour to submit a political review' of the past year in Iran. Having arrived only a few days before the end of the year, I have been unable to contribute anything to this report, which is mainly the work of Mr. Pink. 2. I am sending copies of this despatch and its enclosure to his Excellency the Viceroy of India. His Majesty’s Ambassador in Cairo, and the Middle East Intelligence Centre. Cairo. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. Enclosure. Political Review of the Year 1939 in Iran. UNTIL the outbreak of war by far the most important event of the year from the point of view of local opinion was the marriage in April of the Crown Prince to Princess Fowzieh. sister of the King of Egypt. Admittedly, the marriage has done little to improve Irano-Egyptian relations, for the Egyptian visitors made no secret of their disappointment at the poverty and backwardness of Iran, and their outspoken comments gave great offence here. There have also been some rather undignified squabbles about the Princess’s dowry. From the Shah’s point of view, however, the marriage was eminently successful in that it definitely put the Pahlavi dynasty on the social map. 2. The sending of special delegations headed by such distinguished personalities as the Earl of Athlone, accompanied by Her Royal Highness Princess Alice, His Royal Highness the Duke of Spoleto and General Weygand, gave an air of dignity to the wedding celebrations which might otherwise have been more remarkable for pomp, ostentation and unpunctuality. I he Shah’s intention, however, was to impress his visitors, and it may be said that, considering the limited means at his disposal, he was eminently successful, particularly since the problems of organisation, always difficult in the East, were further complicated by the fact that no entertainments in European style on so large a scale had previously been attempted in Iran. 3. Relations between Iran and the United Kingdom have been cordial, though the decision of His Majesty’s Government to seize German exports has caused serious concern to the Iranian Government, and has to some extent offset the excellent impression made by Her Royal Highness Princess Alice and Lord Athlone’s visit in the spring. His Majesty’s Government’s policy with regard to German exports in effect prevents the Iranian Government from continuing to trade with the one country on which they have hitherto almost entirely depended for the materials necessary for the carrying out of their programme of industrialisation. Since the United Kingdom is at present unable to supply Iran with more than a very small proportion of her needs, it is not surprising that the Government are both perplexed and indignant at the workings of a policy under which in effect Iran is no longer able to trade with her best customer, and has not been offered alternative export or import markets of any consequence. Since in recent years Germany not only supplied Iran with [2—104]industrial material and finished goods of all types, but also took by far the greater proportion of her exports, the problem of finding new markets is obviously one of great urgency, and if a solution cannot be found it seems likely that the Iranian Government will direct a greater share of their resentment towards the Government whom they hold responsible for their plight. 1 his question is of course closely connected with the negotiations for credits to be granted to Iran by His Majesty’s Government. If these negotiations are successful, and if it proves possible to supply a reasonable proportion of Iran s needs without undue delay, then Iranian resentment at the interruption of trade with Germany may be expected to diminish. 4. As regards local relations, while the boycott of foreigners continued unabated, there was a welcome reduction in the number of expulsions of British Indian subjects from Eastern Iran and of incidents in which they were involved. It may in fact be said that relations have remained friendly, and it is certain that the Shah’s sympathies, were he to express them, would be found to be more in favour of the iVllies than of Germany. The latter’s alliance with Russia indeed makes this almost inevitable. 5. The attitude of the Shah and his Government towards the war may fairly be described as one of frantic neutrality. An official declaration of neutrality was published immediately on the bufbreaK of hostilities and all foreign missions were so informed. The Government-controlled press has been allowed to publish no independent comment on the progress of the war, but has been forced to content itself with printing extracts from news agency reports. German bribery has admittedly been responsible for the appearance of an unduly high proportion of Deutsches Nachrichten-Buro reports, but on the whole the Government have done their best to preserve the balance. Listening to foreign broadcasts in public places is also officially forbidden, though little notice appears to be taken of this edict except in Tehran. In order to avoid any possibility of incidents, the Govern ment, during the first weeks of the war, went so far as to arrange that diplomatic receptions should be duplicated in order that the representatives of the rival Powers should not meet, while at the opening of the new session of the Majlis in October, the Diplomatic Corps was divided into two and accommodated in separate galleries, the representatives of neutral Powers being divided amongst the belligerents. 6. Iranian relations with Germany have been marked by difficulties in the •commercial sphere, and also by differences arising from the activities of the large German colony (some 1,500 in Tehran alone), which the Iranian Government regarded as too openly propagandist. This colony is active and well organised, and is carrying out a whispering campaign in the bazaars which, aided by the average Iranian’s gullibility and ignorance of world affairs, has proved an effective form of propaganda. Efficient and well organised though German propaganda has been, there are, however, signs of a tendency to doubt German claims and assurances now that some of their more fantastic assertions have been proved untrue. A good example of the Government’s suspicions is the arrest of Herr Robert Renner, who has been resident in Shiraz for many years, and has been in prison for several weeks, simply because the Government fear that he might develop into another Wassmuss. The present German Minister, Dr. Smend, has been recalled, and it is understood that the Iranian Government have expressed no great enthusiasm over his successor, Herr Ettel, who was formerly employed here by the Lufthansa. German merchants have been severely criticised for their failure to deliver goods ordered by Iranian merchants before the outbreak of war, and there have been inspired attacks in the press on this alleged breach of faith. The Lufthansa service to Europe ceased on the outbreak of war. The Italian Government have made unsuccessful attempts to secure P permission for a terminal service to Tehran. The Italian Minister is believed to w have discovered that the chief source of obstruction was his German colleague. 7. Soviet relations have been a constant cause of anxiety to the Iranian Government during the year. The commercial agreement, which lapsed in 1938. has still not been renewed, and the effect on Iranian economy has naturallv been disastrous. Reports are current that the Russians are holding out for very con siderable concessions as the price of a new agreement, and in particular that they are demanding the right to trade direct with individual firms, thus cutting out the monopoly companies in whose hands the trade of the country is so largely concentrated.I 3 \ ,• •*s 8. Fears of a possible Russian invasion have naturally been current ever since the outbreak of war. The occupation of Poland, another neighbour of Russia, and the attack on Finland have caused great anxiety, and there have been frequent reports of Russian troop concentrations on the Azerbaijan and Turkestan frontiers. No absolute confirmation of these reports has been received, and it seems likely that the Soviet Government have adopted the German policy of a whispering campaign, through agents in the bazaars, as a means of working upon Persian nerves, and of preparing the ground for a campaign of blackmail to be followed, if necessary, by the use of force, if and when they consider such tactics expedient. 9. Diplomatic relations with France, which were broken off at the end of 1938 owing to the Shah’s displeasure at some punning references in one of the less reputable French newspapers, were resumed in February after an exchange of telegrams in which the Shah received an apology from the French President, and, in accepting it, administered a rebuke. The French Minister, who was ill when relations were broken off, never left Tehran, and the breach made less actual difference than might have been expected. The reason for the resumption of relations was that arrangements had ben made for the Crown Prince to travel through Syria on his way to Egypt, and if the breach with France had not been healed it would have been necessary either to make other arrangements or for the Crown Prince to pass through Syria without receiving the usual honours from the French authorities. 10. An improvement in relations with the United States was marked by the appointment of Mr. Louis B. Dreyfus, jun., as United States Minister at Tehran, and M. Shayesteh asCjranian Minister in Washington. M. Shayesteh has left for Washington, but Mr. Dreyfus has not yet left his previous post. 11. A treaty of friendship of the usual type was signed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Japanese Minister. It is said that this treaty is to be followed by a commercial agreement, but nothing has as yet materialised. 12. The disappearance of Czecho-Slovakia was a severe blow to the Shah. In pursuance of his policy of attempting to buy armaments only from small States which were not in a position to exert undue influence upon Iran, the army has been equipped almost entirely by Skoda and Brno and by the Swedish firm of Bofors. The dissolution of Czecho-Slovakia and the taking over of the Skoda works by Krupps, therefore, made the Shah even more dependent on Germany than before, and that in a sphere in which he had previously taken good care to preserve his independence. 13. The opening of the new session of the Majlis on the 26th October provided the one major political surprise of the year. It was then announced that M. Jam. the President of the Council, had been appointed Minister of Court, and that Dr. Matin Daftary, the youthful Minister of Justice, had been appointed to succeed him. At the same time it was announced that General Amir Khosrovi, the governor of the National Bank, had been appointed Minister of Finance in place of M. Bader. The appointment of M. Jam as Minister of Court fills a post which has been vacant since the fall of Teymourtache, but is likely in the present case to be one of honour rather than great influence. The elimination of M. Bader is of interest since he was generally regarded as the most pro-German member of the Government. 14. The deterioration in the financial position of Iran during the year was reflected in the steady fall of the rial on the Black Bourse from 140 to 175 to the £ sterlng despite artificial measures to restrict its fall. No attempt was made to balance the budget and for the first time since 1928-29 a deficit was revealed, which was larger than the total expenditure in that year, amounting as it did to 683,385.287 rials. Much of the expenditure provided for was in respect of roads and communications, and work has continued on the railway lines from Tehran to Tabriz and from Tehran to Meshed. The latter has now been completed as far as Semnan, the Garmsar-Semnan sector being officially opened in June. 15. The Government’s shortage of money found expression in an inspired press campaign directed against the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, who were accused of deliberately restricting production and thereby cheating the Iranian Government of the royalties which they were entitled to expect in ever-increasing measure. This campaign caused the company many sleepless nights and in June Lord Cadman flew out in order to explain the position to the Shah in person. The discussions covered such questions as the delimitation of the new area for4 the company’s concession, the dues to be paid at the projected port at Bandar Mashur, and the vexed question of output and markets. Lord Gadman’s explana tions appeared to have succeeded in their object; at any rate there have so far been no more attacks on the company. 16. To sum up. the Shah’s chief preoccupation at present is his anxiety to keep his country out of war and at the same time to reach an agreement with the Soviet Government which will enable Iran once more to trade with the one country which is the natural outlet for her exports, and whose importance has increased enormously now that the German market is almost entirely closed. \ o achieve these aims he is determined to pursue a policy of the strictest neutrality and to avoid giving his powerful neighbour any excuse for military or economic penetration into Northern Iran. The success or failure of this policy may well depend to a considerable extent on the degree to which the Finnish Government succeeds in resisting Russian invasion.1 K [17—65] 'W' THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAN NIC MAJESTTS GOV -.

Oof ve.e p THE Shah continues to be the mainspring of all activities. Unfortunately, as he ages he becomes more greedy, more arrogant and remote, and more unpopular. Apart from the public in general, who attribute to him the rise in the net cost of living, there must now be a large class of malcontents whose lands have been bought for the Shah, under pressure, at ruinously low prices. The Shah’s unpopularity extends to his sons. The second—an impudent rake and a dangerous road-hog— is the worst, but the Crown Prince commands no respect or affection. Whether the Shah-believes the adulation served up to him in the local press is not known, but it is known that his advisers are afraid to give him any unpleasant news. There had been bread queues for months before any action was taken, and it is probable that the shortage of flour in certain areas had been concealed from the Shah. He sees no one but his Ministers and a few officials such as the Chief of Police; no longer is he protected by that safety-valve, the public submission of petitions to the throne, and he never sees the foreign representatives, to talk to. except at the formal visits on first arrival and final departure. There is ample evidence that Ministers habitually give the Shah hasty and optimistic reports of foreign affairs, and, when these forecasts are not fulfilled, accuse the foreigners concerned of going back upon their word. The Shah continues to be morbidly sensitive to any reference in the foreign press that is not adulatory, and this led during the year to protests to the American, Swedish and Swiss Legations, which were all met with polite disclaimers of official responsibility. 2. A child was born to the Crown Prince on the 27th October. It was a daughter, but, although that may have been disappointing to the Imperial family, it is not likely to make any difference in the long run. for the chances that the Pahlavi dynasty will maintain itself seem small. 3. Law and order seem to have deteriorated slightly. This has been notice able chiefly in the tribal areas, and is mainly due to the general state of poverty and to the depredations of the road guards. In Ears and Khuzistan, and to a smaller extent in the Kermanshah area, there have been spasmodic outbursts of banditry. There has been similar activity among the Baluchi tribesmen in the Province of Kerman. A number of leading Bakhtiaris have been arrested, but that is credibly attributed to German intrigues designed to stir up the Bakhtiaris against the British in the oil area. 4. There are striking outward marks of the present regime in the growing number of industrial enterprises and the extension of the railway. The Shahentertains lor economic development a feverish passion which in many cases is heightened by a personal financial interest. The country is manufacturing some goods of quite passable quality, but there are too many silos with no grain in them, too many sugar factories with too little to do; and no one knows whether the ambitious blast furnaces which are being erected near Kerej will cv^r do any serious work. There are less obvious marks of the regime in the general poverty and the increasing corruption of officials of all classes. The bread shortage and the adulteration of flour in various parts of the country, even in Tehran, have caused considerable discontent. The Government’s remedy for discontent is a vigilant police, a controlled press and now a controlled wireless broadcasting service. Tehran radio was opened in April. It is intended to have eventually twelve relaying stations, so that the whole country may be covered; the next step will surely be to prevent listeners from owning sets which can receive foreign broadcasts. The leaders of official society have to assemble every Thursday for several hours to listen to propaganda talks and plays. Another step in the elimination of all influences other than those of the State was accomplished by the compulsory transfer of the American and British schools to the Iranian Government. Negotiations for the transfer of the only remaining foreign schools, viz., the French, were proceeding at the end of the year. 5. On the 29th June the Shah made a speech to the Deputies and directors of the press, which at first seemed to be important. He blamed his Ministers, par ticularly the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Interior, who had recently “ resigned,” for not keeping him informed, and said it was the duty of Ministers to make the country realise the situation and prepare it for hard times; this they had failed to do, with the result that in the prevailing confusion Iran’s proper rights were being injured. He appealed to the new Prime Minister and to the Majlis to remedy this, and especially to the press; naturally the press must not argue about belligerent countries, but it must write careful articles to guide public opinion. It is believed that, in the secret meeting which followed, the Shah said something about the foreign situation, but that was never confirmed. The public utterance was at first taken to be important, but if it was true (as it doubtless was) that the Shah had been kept in the dark, that was largely because of the terror which his furious temper and resentment of criticism inspired in his advisers, while to accuse the controlled press of not enlightening the public was a foolish injustice. The only result of this outburst was that for a short time the newspapers produced inspired articles on foreign policy, but these became more and more anodyne, until the press became as submissively dull as before. 6. The Shah has steadily pursued two intentions—to remain neutral, and to carry out his plan of economic development with as little interruption as pos sible. It was undoubtedly the Shah’s views which were expressed by the Crown Prince when he received His Majesty’s Minister in January; His Imperial High ness did not hide his opinion that the war was a nuisance to Iran : “ only Danzig ” stood between the world and peace; it was a pity that Germany had been “ thrown into the arms of Russia.” It is natural that Iran sliould regret the ending of that pre-war situation so advantageous for herself, when the increasing power of Germany tended to counterbalance that of the two Powers she regards as her ancient enemies, Russia and Great Britain, and when the German economic system fitted so neatly in to that of Iran. When the war began it is probable that the feeling of the Iranian Government {i.e., chiefly the Shah) was mainly one of fear lest the weakening of Germany should leave Russia free to pursue her ancient designs upon Iran, but various events, such as the German attitude towards the Russo-Finnish war and the sinister Molotov-Hitler talks in Berlin, made the Iranian Government incline eventually to the view that Iran would count little in German eyes if it was a question of a bargain with Russia. Although there were signs that official circles on the whole hoped for and expected a German victory, until doubt was thrown on that possibility in the autumn, it could not be fairly said that they showed active pro-German feelings as a whole, though occasional protests had to be made because it seemed to His Majesty’s Legation that the controlled press favoured Axis rather than Allied news items. There was, it is true, a pro-German current in the Ministry of Finance, a current probably due in the main to corruption; but, since the Ministry of Finance has to satisfv the Shah by selling Iranian produce and securing essential goods, it is not surpris ing that its officials should incline towards the Power which it finds most useful in this respect, Germany at first lost her position as Iran’s most considerablecustomer and source of supply owing to the interruption of the sea routes, hut she regained it by means of a transit trade through Russia and Turkey. Efforts made by the Iranian Government to find in Great Britan an alternative source of supply and possibly a customer were on the whole a failure, whose gradual realisation by the Iranian Government caused much friction and ill will. The Iranian Government committed one unneutral and dishonest act, which, though the dishonesty was not detected until January 1941, calls for mention here. On the strength of their own information, supported by oral assurances from various high officials that no wheat was being exported, His Majesty's Legation recom mended an application from the Iranian Government for 30,000 tons of Indian wheat, but when one shipment had reached Iran and another was on the way it was found that wheat was in fact being exported to Russia from the northern ports, though whether for Germany direct or to replace Russian wheat exported to Germany was not known. 7. When Sir R. Bullard was received by the Shah, as the new minister of Great Britain, on the last day but one of 1939, the Shah spoke of the goods which he wished to obtain for the economic development of his country and the defence of its neutrality—objects which he assumed would not be displeasing to His Majesty’s Government. The minister replied that the stronger Iran 'was, the happier His Majesty’s Government would be, and that they would not wish any action of theirs to slow down the pace of development in Iran. He was able to state that the chief obstacle to the conclusion of a credits agreement had been removed; that it was hoped to supply in 1940 the whole of a contract for 72,000 tons of steel rails and accessories; that negotiations were in progress which would lead to the supply of Hurricane aircraft; and that His Majesty’s Government would consider sympathetically the application of the Iranian Government for permission to import from Germany, in spite of our reprisals policy, war material which it was claimed had been ordered and paid for before the war began. The minister reported to the Foreign Office that the interview was marked by an air of geniality rare with the Shah, but that the durability of the honevmoon atmo sphere was dependent upon the delivery of rails, aircraft, and so on, and on the passage of the German goods in question through our naval control. Two months later the new Iranian Minister to Great Britain. Mr. Muqaddam, urged the needs of Iran upon Lord Halifax in his first interview. He begged Lord Halifax not to underestimate the importance of Iran at the present time. Geography had placed her in a post of immense importance for the common front, and the Shah and the public, both of whom were anxious to be 100 per cent, on the British side, were distressed to find that most of her neighbours had drawn much larger benefits from association with Great Britain than had hitherto flowed in the direction of Iran. The Iranian budget, he said, was small and much strained by the development projects, to many of which the war had brought embarrassment; it was therefore of the utmost importance to Great Britain that Iran should be treated as generously as possible in several matters relating to the oil-fields and to trade in general. The talk about the common front and the desire to be whole heartedly with Great Britain was nonsense, probably inserted by Mr. Muqaddam; but that the Shah thought it outrageous that any country, even an ally of Great Britain, should get more than he got was true' enough.' Lord Halifax gave a friendly reply, and recalled to Mr. Muqaddam the obvious fact that, if we could not furnish Iran with the armaments she required, it was because we ourselves needed them elsewhere. Already by then the hopes raised at the interview on 30th December were fading. It is true that His Majesty’s Government gave Iran the most generous treatment in the matter of the German goods alleged to have been ordered and paid for before the war, but she got no credit whatever for this, but only criticism for asking for ordinary proofs of origin and payment, and for the delay which resulted from the Iranian Government’s own stupidity and obstinacy about furnishing those proofs. As to the other three points, the position at the end of the year was that the Credits Agreement had been signed, but cancelled by the Shah on the ground that he had got nothing by it; that no Hurricane aircraft (let alone other military aircraft which the Iranian Govern ment wanted) had been supplied; and that of the 72,000 tons of rails and acces sories the total delivered was only about 6,500 tons, and there was no hope of the rest. 8. The Credits Agreement had been under discussion when the war began. The Shah had completed the north-to-south railway and many other projects with- [17-65] ' B 2out borrowing, but the development schemes were costing such large sums that he began to consider the possibility of getting credits whose repayment wou.d be secured on the oil royalties. To obviate publicity His Majesty s Government withdrew the condition that the arrangement should be confirmed by the Majlis, and on the 16th February an Exports Credits Agreement was signed providing tor credit facilities up to £5 million. The Shah seems to have been under the impression that this would enable him to acquire, or at least to order, m Great Britain immediately the kind of goods that he wanted up to a limit of £5 million. The Iranian Government began with requests for war material, but it was found that all that we could offer was less important articles, such as gas masks and steel helmets, and the Iranian Government then decided not to use any of the credits for land warfare weapons, but to spend £2 million on aircraft and £3 million on rails (200,000 tons), locomotives, cement, and explosives and spare parts for the railway. Already in April the Iranian Government were being warned b\ the Foreign Office that it would be exceedingly difficult to give them either aircraft or railway material. Unfortunately, it was found that the words foi the development of Iran ” in the Credits Agreement were not justified b} the wot as of the parliamentary vote of credit: the Treasury were advised that those words might remotely be held to cover credits of all kinds to allies, but only defence and quasi-defence material in the case of neutrals. Since communications are neces sary to defence, it is reasonable to maintain that rails, and cement for railway bridges, are quasi-defence material, but these subtleties mattered little, sinee^ it was soon found that we could not supply rails from the United Kingdom e\en foi cash, and that cement for cash could not be supplied within a reasonable period. In an effort to give the Iranian Government some satisfaction, His Majesty s Govern ment offered to allow the credits to be used to some extent for the purchase of rails and accessories in India, but already by the end of April the Minis!n of Finance were asking whether His Majesty's Government could convert some of the Iranian Government’s sterling into dollars at the official rate to enable goods to be purchased, s.g., in the United States of America, and on the 17th June the Ministry for Foreign Affairs sent to His Majesty s Legation a curt note declai ing the Credits Agreement cancelled because of the alleged failure on the part of His Majesty’s Government to fulfil their obligations under its terms. At the same time an official announcement on the subject appeared in the press. I his seemed at first sight to call for a protest, since His Majesty’s Government had observed the greatest secrecy at the request of the Iranian Government, but the announce ment was skilfully, if untruthfully, worded so as to make it appeal th&lt;it the agreement had been with the Anglo-Iranlan Oil Company; thus, on the one hand the guns of His Majestv s Government were spiked, and on the othei the Shah was defended against the widespread tale that he had accepted a loan from His Majesty’s Government. This tale may well have been one of the causes of cancel lation, but the difficulty we had in supplying what the Shah wanted under the agreement afforded reasonable ground for dissatisfaction. Fhe Shah piobabl^ had other and less honourable grounds also : notably the desire to be free to black mail the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and the German victories in Europe, which both made him bolder and aroused the suspicion that Great Britain would soon be useless as a source of supply. All this was unfortunate, but except for the misleading wording of the agreement on the subject of 'development” it is difficult to see how the incident could have been avoided. No one could have fore seen. when the agreement was drawn up, or even when it was signed, how the war would develop, and how desperately we should need for our own and our Allies’ use the very things that the Iranian Government wanted to obtain from us. Even the hope that rails might be supplied from India came to nothing, because of the growing demands of other parts of the Empire for steel, which could not be supplied from the United Kingdom. In this case, however, we are protected from criticism (or ought to be) by the fact that the Minister of Finance rejected the first offer because the prices were higher than those of the rails covered by the English contract. „ , , 9. No sooner was the Credits Agreement cancelled than there occurred an acute controversy with the An^lo-Iranian Oil Company. This had been fore shadowed in the farewell interview which Sir H. Seymour had with the Shah in December 1939. when the Shah stated that the company were not pressing on with their development scheme as they should, and that it would be to everyone’s advantage that a larger quantity of oil should be exported from Iran. The/ 5 reasons for the falling oh in exports had already been explained to the ^ah and to the Iranian officials concerned, and they were repeated by a director of the company who was received by the Shah in February. The Shah, howevei. was not interested to learn that the demand for oil had diminished because of the restrictions on the use of private cars in the United Kingdom, the necessity to carry oil by the quickest route (e.g., from America) because of shortage of tankers, and so on. What he wanted was to have at least as much money as he had counted on when he forced a new concession on the company in 1933; and since, by breaking his word and committing blackmail, he got what he wanted, he was completely justified by his own standard and that of all but a very few Persians. A full explanation of the reduction in exports, sent in by His Majesty’s Legation on instruction from the Foreign Office, brought from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs an extremely rude reply saying that it wasn t anv business of His Majesty’s Government—a reply only withdrawn when the Ministry for Foreign Affairs were reminded that the first thing the new Iranian Minister to London had done was to raise this very question. I he controversy became involved with the question of the conversion of sterling into gold. On I the 27th June the Ministry of Finance informed the Tehran representative of the company, Mr. Rice, that the royalties for the quarter must be paid m gold, which must be capable of being remitted to the United States. I his request, which was contrary to the terms of the concession, and in any case impossible for the company to carry out, could not be complied with, whereupon Mr. Rice i, was informed that, unless the company could satisfy the claims of the Iranian Government, a proposal to cancel the concession would be put before the Majlis on the 7th July. It is not necessary to follow the dispute in detail. Ridiculous debates, carefully rehearsed, were held in the Majlis, in which it was assumed that the company could sell all the oil it could produce; remonstrances by His Majesty’s Government were disregarded; and reminders that the concession, which had been imposed on the company by the Iranian Government themselves, provided that all disputes should be settled by arbitration, were ignored. In the end the company had to agree to make an immediate payment of £1.500.000, and to undertake to make the Iranian Government’s oil revenue up to £4 million for each of the years 1940 and 1941. The only satisfaction the company obtained was from the insertion in the letters exchanged of a proviso that the arrange ment would not affect the terms of the concession or create a precedent. The Ministry of Finance finally agreed to the insertion of this clause, but transmitted at the same time a characteristic message from the Shah that he would modify the concession whenever he liked. It was humiliating to have to submit to this blackmail, but the demands came at the most difficult moment of the war. and it was not thought worth while to precipitate a crisis which might perhaps interfere with our oil supplies. The matter is not closed, since the differences in regard to the period after 1941 are to be examined c ‘ with due consideration to the conditions of the time with a view to reaching an arrangement agreeable to both parties.” What that arrangement will be will depend upon the military situation at that time, and not upon the wording of the concession or of the safeguards attached to the new arrangement. 10. To the request made by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in April, for the conversion into gold of some of the sterling lying to the credit of the Iranian Government in London, His Majesty’s Government replied in the first instance that it was not possible to extend to Iran facilities not permitted to other countries. Later, however, they made an offer which was conveyed to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in a note dated the 12th July, under which the Iranian Government would be able to purchase gold deliverable at Ottawa as required to meet purchases in the United States of America up to a maximum of £250,000 per month. It was not until December that agreement was reached. The Iranian Government demanded the conversion of £6 million during the two vears ending the 31st December, 1941, and the freedom to convert any sum at any time within the annual limit of £3 million, but they eventually accepted His Majesty’s Government’s final offer of the conversion of £6 million during the two years ending the 30th June, 1942, in quarterly instalments, payable at the beginning of each quarter, of £750,000. 11. One of the few moral assets we have in this country is the presence of British personnel in the Tehran aircraft factory. These men, most of whom would have volunteered for war work if they had not received a message from ' rawpmn6 His Majesty s Government telling them that they were performing a public service where they were, have won more approval from the Iranian Government than the stupidity with which the factory is run by the Iranian supervisory staff would suggest. However, the delay in the despatch from the United Kingdom oi material for aircraft construction was leading up, at the end of the year, to the moment when the Iranian Government might say that, unless the material could he delivered, the British personnel would no longer be required. 12. References to the Iranian claim to Bahrain were made both in the well-staged debates in the Majlis about the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company concession and in articles about the Italian bombing of Bahrain. More practical action was taken by the Iranian postal authorities in Gulf ports, who refused to accept letter mails from Bahrain on the pretext that the procedure had been altered m May 1939 and that the new procedure was that laid down for inter national mails, and. therefore, implied that Bahrain was a foreign country to Iran. What the trouble was seemed obscure, and it had not been settled by the end of the year. Meanwhile, the Bahrain postal authorities had been refusing to accept parcels sent from Iranian ports because the Iranian postal authorities tiad lefused to pay the terminal charges on parcels for previous years on the gi ound that terminal charges are onlv leviable on parcels sent to a foreign country. ' &amp; 13. Fear of Russia, the master-motive in this country, fluctuated from violent appiehension to fatalistic calm. I o replace the trade agreement between Soviet Russia and Iran, which lapsed in 1938. a treaty of commerce and navi- gatron was initialled in Moscow on the 10th March and ratified by the Majlis m lehran on the 4th April. The most important provision was that which secures to Soviet Russia the right to deal with individual Iranians or Iranian tirms mstead of dealing only with monopolies or Government departments; this anords greater opportunities for the extension of Soviet influence. Much was oped iiom tins treaty, but by the end of the year little had arrived from Russia that the country wanted, while Iran was exporting live-stock and rice to Russia m quantities much greater than she could afford. It was generally believed that secret political or military clauses were attached to the treaty, though the Iranian ' inistr y i° r Foreign Affairs denied that such matters were even mentioned during the negotiations. One persistent belief was that Soviet Russia had compeJIed the Iranian Government to undertake to place certain landing-grounds at the disposal of Russia m certain circumstances. This would be a breach of neutrality, and if, as was stated in one report, the aerodrome at Khwash was included it would constitute a direct threat to British interests in India and the 1 Persian Gull But it might be argued that such an undertaking on the part of Iran would only be a particular application of the right accorded to Russia under article 6 of the Russo-Persian Treaty of 26th February. 1921. to send forces into Iran if a third Power should introduce forces into Iran to make it a base for operations against Russia. Article 6 is itself unneutral, since there is nothing to prevent Russia from acting as judge as to the moment for intervention k ,™t r y for Foreign Affairs admitted that this article was now unsuitable and that the Iiaman Government would have liked to have it abrogated. There is little doubt that early m the year the Soviet and German Governments were ■nth anxious about the possibility that Allied aeroplanes might bomb Baku and Soviet anxiety flared up into angry accusations of Iranian complicity when the P'P lsh , ed foments alleged to have been found in France and to show that the Allies had in fact drawn up such a plan. Articles appeared in the ehran press reaffirming the country’s policy of neutrality and protesting against a egations of complicity in the schemes, real or supposed, of any belligerent. . imilar articles appeared when the Soviet Government alleged that foreio-n noinl of g yr° m t Iran “ d Turke y flown over So4t territory. In point of fact the Minister of War. m conversation with the military attache in January about Iran s urgent need for sixty bombing aircraft which he wished 1 to obtain from the United Kingdom, had spoken of the necessity to “ carTy the var into the enemy camp, stated that Iran was readv to sacrifice half her bombing strength in order to destroy or damage Baku, and given it as \Z personal and confidential opinion ” that it was time for “ us ” to co ordinate p ans. as «c had the same end m view. It was supposed at the time that these views, which were received with caution by the miltarv attache and never alluS to again by either side, could not have been uttered without the Shah’s Mn^MM but no confirmation of that supposition was ever obtained. Iran has a non- aggression treaty with Soviet Russia and this was quoted by M. Molotov at about the time when the commercial treaty was concluded, but this gave little comfort to the Iranian Government, not onty because of their standing distrust of Russia, but also because they remembered that a similar treaty had not saved Finland from attack. I here was great apprehension as to what passed at the Hitler-Molotov meeting in Berlin in November, and although the anxiety became less acute, the Iranian Government seemed to have come to the conclusion by the end of the year that they could not expect any help from Germany against Russia at present and that it was even possible that Iran had been recognised by Germany as in Russia’s sphere of interest. 14. Russian influence inside Iran certainly increased during the year. The \ provision in the treaty of March for direct dealings between Soviet trade repre sentatives and individual Iranian firms and merchants had perhaps not begun to have any great effect, but the public could not be uninfluenced by the Soviet films which began to be shown regularly in one cinema in Tehran—some of them pure Soviet propaganda. Moreover, the hopeless condition of the country caused large sections of the population to turn their eyes to the north, either in hope, or in the despair arising from the feeling that any change must be for the better. 1 here was even a movement among the intellectuals in favour of Soviet Russia. 15. The prestige of Germany in Iran naturally increased greatly as a result of the series of victories which culminated in the fall of France, but it diminished somewhat towards the end of the year when Great Britain not only continued to hold out but was able to dbfeat the Italians in Libya. The German cause was assisted by a well-organised propaganda comprising all the necessary elements*—pamphlets and periodicals, a whispering campaign, films and news reels, and above all the wireless broadcasts in Persian from Berlin. These broad casts eventually went too far : already in May the local press complained that they were directing complaints and threats against “neutral countries.” and when a little later they contained violent attacks on the Shah, complaints were made to the German Legation. The German Government alleged that the offensive material had been introduced by the Persian announcer without authority, and although the lie was not believed, the removal of the announcer and the cessation of attacks on the Shah and on Iran, were accepted as sufficient reparation. 1 he authorities, however, stopped the giving of foreign broadcasts in public and the Germans lost thereby a valuable form of propaganda. The intense activity of the German community in Tehran and elsewhere 5 at the time when the fate of Holland and Belgium showed what havoc a Fifth Column could work in a neutral country gave good ground to suppose that the Germans in Iian were piepaiing some coup or at least taking dispositions which would fac ilitate &lt;i coup in case of need. This possibility was repeatedlv brought to the notice of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and efforts were made to convey similar warnings to the Shah by a roundabout route. There is little doubt that one of the leasons, probable the mam reason, for the removal of the Prime Ministei Mr. Matin Daftari. towards the end of June, was his notoriously pro- German attitude. The authorities did not take all the measures that seemed desnable, but it was clear that they were alarmed, and they probably went as far as the) dared. They did not remove essential machinery from German ships at Bandar Shapur, to make it impossible for one of them to slip out and sink itself m the fairway and block the Shatt-al-Arab, but they did establish a stringent supervision over the crew; they did not reduce the German community to the size proportionate to the work it professed to be doing, but they did send away some Germans whose actions seemed suspicious, and a very close watch is kent upon those who remain. Unfortunately the Germans are interested in so many enterprises which are considered by the Iranian Government as essential from the erection of German blast furnaces to the carriage of Iranian exports to Germany and German imports into Iran, that “cover ” for illegal activities is easily provided It was discovered in November that one of thes? activities was to foster anti-British intrigues m Iraq. 16. [he Germans soon recovered their pre-war position as Iran’s best customer and principal supplier of goods. When Italy entered the war the Trieste route, through which His Majesty’s Government had allowed Iran to receive a large quantity of German arms and material, was closed, but noodsMf! m i have moved both ways through Russia (sometimes hampered by Russian ill will) and through Turkey (Trebizond), and at the end of the year the route through Iraq was about to be tried. In spite of the shortage of certain detic i ma eiia s, Germany managed better than any other country to satisfy Iranian email s, and the bazaar contains nothing but German goods in many lines. some insistence on the part of Iran to secure a promise of goods up o e \&lt; of the clearing balance, and doubtless Germany’s urgent need of certain Iranian raw materials, such as cotton and wool, reinforced Iran s bargaining powei. Germans showed the greatest eagerness in buying anything that mig e ? ’ and it is understood that the quotas agreed upon for the Iranian year beginni in March 1941 provide for even larger purchases by Germany, including tons of cotton and 20,000 tons of rice. These figures represent the ideal: they may be lowered in practice by shortages in the crop. Russian competition, 01 othe causes; but the fact that Germany asks for such quantities provides one good reason for Germany’s popularity in this country , . 17. The Italians were very active in the early months of the year buying cotton and trying to obtain permission for the Italian air-line through 13ag( a to be continued to Tehran, and to persuade the Iranian Government to buy Italian bombing aeroplanes. The cessation of the Italian steamers from Trieste when Italy entered the war, was a blow to Iran. Three steamers were laid up at Bandar Shapur and one at Bandar Abbas, under strict supervision. The Iranian Govern ment showed a particular! interest in the cargo of the steamship Arabia, an Italian ship which took refuge in Assab when Italy entered the war; it con sisted mainly of material for some of the Shah’s industrial projects, and tor tha reason extraordinary efforts were made to secure it. His Majesty s Government made an exception m favour of the Iranian Government and granted permis sion for a neutral ship to pass through our naval control to ship this cargo. 1 his subiect requires a place in the political report because, after the Iranian Govern ment had paid about £50,000 to charter a Panamanian ship in virtue of a pro mise from the Italian Government that she would be allowed to visit Assab, this permission was withdrawn (January 1941) and the Italian Government became an object of execration in those Iranian Government circles which feel the imme diate force of the Shah’s anger. Italy had, however, become unpopular before that when her aeroplanes bombed Bahrain and the American oil plant at Dhahran, in Saudi Arabia, and an Italian paper suggested that they should bomb Abadan, whose oil, it alleged, belonged to the British navy. I he press of the capital wrote a warning article stating that the oil belonged to the Iranian State, and that any attack on it would be resisted. The Prime Minister informed His Majesty’s Minister later that similar warnings had been conveyed to the Italian and German Ministers, who had given solemn assurances that there was no intention to bomb the Iranian oilfields and installations. Ihe defeat of the Italians by the Greeks and. later, by the British in Egypt gave general satistac- tion m Iran.^ g aa( i a ) ;)a( j p act began the year in eclipse, and after a brief spell of brilliance went back into obscurity. In June a letter to the editor of a I ersian paper (doubtless concocted in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs) urged other oriental countries to rely on their own strength and to co-ordinate their efforts to keep out of the greedy hands of Western peoples. Friendly references to Iraq and to the Saadabad Pact, which appeared (under some Iraqi pressure) on the birthday of the young King of Iraq, faded away before the measures which the Iraqi Government decided to apply in their territory near the Iranian border when the possibility of a Fifth Column movement in Iran seemed quite near. Eventu ally the more extreme of these measures were not applied, and a threat to put into execution the Iraqi law on trades and professions, which if applied strictly would throw out of work, as foreigners, most of the population of Kerbela and Najaf, was not in fact carried out. Nevertheless, relations between the two countries were not cr 0 od The delimitation of the frontier made no progress whatever, thanks, it would appear, to the inaction of the Iranian Commissioner, who seems to have been as successful in stultifying the purpose of the commission as the Iranian officials concerned have been in making the Turco-Persian Frontier Zone Con vention of 1937 of no effect. For in spite of the particular respect shown to Turkey in Iran. Turkish affairs seem to suffer the same neglect and delay as those of other countries. Turkey at least gets a good press in Iran as a rule, but when President Inonii, in his speech in the Turkish Parliament on the 1st November,9 announced that the bonds of alliance with (ireat Britain were solid and unbreak able, the Shah seems to have been scared lest he should be supposed to be in the same galley, and he took unobtrusive steps to dissociate himself from this “ non-belligerent ” policy and to reaffirm his neutrality. The “ resignation ’ of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, M. Muzaffar A Tam. and his transfer to the governorship of Rezaieh, were believed to be due to his championship of the Saadabad Pact. 19. In July the Tehran press published two articles about Fgypt, alleging that she was being “ consumed in a war from which she drew no advantage,’ and expressing sympathy with her in the sufferings with which she was afflicted “ especially on the part of her Ally.” Fwerything went to show that this out burst was due to dynastic solidarity between the Shah and King Farouk of Egypt. It was mentioned by His Majesty’s Minister to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs as one of several signs of ill-wili towards His Majesty’s Government which had been noticed recently. 20. The United States Legation was of the greatest assistance to His Majesty’s Legation throughout the year, the Charge d’Affaires, Mr. Engert, being about a year ahead of his Government in his recognition of the fact that Britain was the United States’ first line of defence. He seized every opportunity to assure the Iranian Government that the United States wanted Great Britain to win. were sure she would win, and would do all they could to ensure that she did win; and he frequently gave His Majesty’s Legation confidential information of con siderable value. The arrival of a minister, Mr. Dreyfus, at the end of the year at last closed the diplomatic unpleasantness which had resulted from the arrest of the Iranian Minister in the United States three years before for exceeding the speed limit. Difficulties in other countries made the Iranian Government look, towards the United States as a source of supply. A proposal made to the Charge d’Affaires in May, that the United States should sell military aeroplanes to Iran on credit, erect a factory for the manufacture of aircraft for the Aero-Club, and provide personnel to replace the British in the existing aircraft factory, came to nothing because it was dependent upon credits. Later, the Iranian Govern ment asked for 30 pursuit planes and 50-60 light bombers from the United States for cash, and they ordered 140,000 tons of rails. Two attempts by the Standard Oil Company to secure permission to look for oil were rejected, the reason given being that it might cause foreign complications. 21. The Japanese were mainly in evidence as buyers of large quantities of opium, with little regard to the price. Negotiations for the supply of aircraft, anti-aircraft guns and other war material, probably on a barter basis, came to nothing. Until October the Japanese Minister was a man who was no friend of the Axis nor an admirer of his country’s policy in China, and there was little suggestion of a common anti-Ally front in his time. He was. however, one of the forty diplomats to be withdrawn by the Japanese Government, and since then the legation has probably walked in the light of the pact. 22. The Iranian Government have continued to afford full recognition to the representatives of the occupied countries except on one occasion, when it required considerable pressure from other missions to secure for the Polish Minister the usual invitation to the dinner on the Shah’s birthday. Czechoslovakia continued to be unrepresented, but the subjects of that State had no trouble with the authori ties, who in fact rather favour them as capable men with no political axe to grind in this country. 23. The Roumanian Legation was suppressed soon after the accession ot General Antonescu to power. This was reasonable, for, except for a few Roumanians working on the railway and some cabaret artistes, Roumania had no interests in this country whatsoever. 24. Public opinion, as opposed to the official attitude, has been on the whole strongly pro-German, and when Holland and Belgium were attacked one saw the strange spectacle of a people who live under the fear of invasion by a Great Power applauding the unprovoked overthrow of another small country by Germany. This is partly due to German propaganda, but it is attributed by experts mainly to the vicarious feeling of triumph which the Iranians, who are, on the whole, a cowardly race, experience at the sight of successful power in any form. That this interpretation has some truth in it is supported by the fact that opinion became less pro-German when Great Britain continued to hold out and the Italians were defeated by the British and even by the Greeks. [17—65] cNevertheless, however complete the Allies’ victory may be, it is not to be expected that Iranians as a whole will ever become as wholeheartedly pro-British as they were pro-German in the middle of 1940. Until undeceived by events they will continue to hope that in the last resort Germany will protect them against Russia—a service which they do not expect Great Britain to perform. But there is another reason. It would be flattering to our self-esteem it we could attribute the natural pro-Germanism of the Iranian to his baseness and his inability to appreciate the more disinterested parts of the British case. He is base, and he doesn’t believe that anyone is ever disinterested, but at the same time it would be foolish to expect our defence of freedom and independence to be taken at its face value by a people who live close to India and the Arab States in the Persian iGulf, who have heard something about our Zionist policy, and who interpret m a fashion highly discreditable to ourselves the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907 land the Anglo-Persian Treaty of 1919. The fact is that Germany is in a strong position in having no overseas possessions and in being able to throw stones at Great Britain without fear of being hurt by a rebound, and now that the fear of Italian entry yet farther into the eastern world seems to have been eliminated, Germany is no longer embarrassed in her eastern policy by attachment to an ally with a dubious past. Moreover, the public, partly under the influence of German propaganda, have come to hold us responsible for the Shah and his misdeeds. The intensity of German propaganda has been mentioned above (paragraph 15). British propaganda has been greatly improved during the year, but it suffers from many handicaps. The British are far less numerous than the Germans; it takes far longer to get periodicals and news-reels from Ungland than from Germany; and in wireless propaganda we have lagged far behind the Germans. It is true that in August India inaugurated a broadcast in Persian from Delhi, which certainly had some influence, but the Iranians tended to regard this as a poor second best, and to resent being treated as of less importance than twenty or thirty other peoples in whose languages news was being broadcast from London. In December, however, the British Broadcasting Corporation began to broadcast in Persian four times a week, and the only criticism ever directed against it by this highly critical people was on the ground that it was not given every night. By the end of the year good British news-reels were beginning to reach Tehran more quickly, and arrangements were in train for a supply of English films with good entertainment as well as propaganda value. But it has been realised that there are two things without which our propaganda can have little effect on public opinion : military successes against Germany, and trade. The general public are glad to see the overthrow of Italy, who enjoys no sympathy here, but they regard Germany as the enemy that Great Britain will have to defeat to win the war, and although many are beginning to wonder whether Germany can win, very few yet believe it possible that she can be defeated. At the end of December His Majesty’s Legation reported that British propaganda in Iran was a plant without roots for the lack of commercial interest to support it. It was explained that Germany’s greater success in satisfying the needs of Iran, and the vacillation of our own policy, ending in a series of disappointments for the Iranian Government, had inevitably created in the minds of the official and com mercial classes the impression of weakness. It was, therefore, urged that the work of the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation, which had just been inaugurated in Iran, should not be restricted merely because the financial balance in any given transaction proposed might be on the wrong side. 25. It could reasonably be argued, until the last year or so, that public opinion in Iran mattered little, since the only person whose opinion resulted in action was the Shah. The Shah is still the only source of authority, but there is now a potential danger in the fact that the population have been persuaded, partly by active German propaganda and partly by their own vanity, which will not admit that they can have deserved the Government they have got, that the British are responsible for all their troubles for having, it is alleged, placed the Shah on the throne and maintained him there ever since. This distortion of the facts, which is carried to such lengths that a senior official has been known to represent the millions extracted from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company by the Shah’s blackmail as a subsidy granted by His Majesty’s Government to bolster up his regime, may be absurd; but it is dangerous, because if the Shah’s grip relaxed, or if trouble resulted, e.g., from the nearer approach of the war to the borders of Iran, the Germans might take advantage of this feeling to promote a movement— nrr * * &lt; t 11 hostile to the Shah and to the British, and to bring into office a Government which would oppose the interests of His Majesty’s Government with the backing of Germany, and perhaps of Russia. Anything, therefore, that can be done to j diminish the general hostility with which we are regarded is worth doing. 26. There was no clear indication, by the end of the year, whether Iran would become involved in the war or not, and the task of His Majesty s Govern ment in deciding upon a policy was complicated by our not knowing for certain whether Russia and Germany were working together or against each other in regard to Iran. The attitude to be adopted in the case of an attack on Iran b\ the Soviet Union had been considered early in the year, in connexion with the suggestion of the Minister of War (paragraph 13) that His Majesty s Govern ment and the Iranian Government should co-ordinate their plans against the Soviet Union. After the matter had been discussed between the Foreign Office and the Service Departments, and had been before the War Oabinet, a reply was sent to His Majesty’s Minister from which this passage may be quoted ££ Generally speaking, the conclusion has been reached that it is not necessary or desirable at the present time to make any response to this approach. In the first place, it is probably better that the Iranian Govern ment should be forced to come more into the open if they want oui aid and assistance. They are likely to be difficult and unsatisfactory allies in an\ case, and if there is to be co-operation between us we want it to be evident that’ it is thev who need it as much as, and even more than, we do. In the second place,’ our ability to assist them against a Soviet attack has been shown by our discussions to be much where it was. . . . That is to say. while we could, and no doubt should, defend the oil-fields and the Iraqi border, and mmht be able to send a certain number of air units to the north of Iraq to assist in repelling the Soviet invasion (a task which might include such counter-measures as the bombing of Baku, &amp;c.), we could not, if the^ aggres sion took place now, send any land troops to I ehran or the north. 27. In May His Majesty’s Ambassador in Iraq suggested that the time had come to consider the despatch of British troops in all its aspects. The piimai\ reason, he stated, would be the defence of Iraq, and the most obvious source ot aggression would be Russia acting through Iran. He foresaw the possibility that the despatch of British reinforcements might be used for hostile propaganda in Russia Iran and elsewhere, but suggested that the then attitude of Russia made the risk less than it might be later on. His Majesty's Minister commented that, while he was sure that any move by His Majesty’s Government to occupy the Iranian oil-fields or refineries would bring about a Russian occupation ot the north of Iran, it was by no means certain that the mere arrival of British troops in Iraq from Palestine (as opposed to the arrival of Indian troops at Basra) would have the same effect, provided that they were not stationed in frontier districts towards Iran, e.g., in Basra. To this and other telegrams m the same strain the Foreign Office replied that His Majesty s Government fully realised the danger of a Soviet counter-move and would certainly do nothing unless they were prepared to face the prospect of such a counter-move At that moment plans existed for the despatch of land forces to safeguard British interests in the oil-fields area should need arise, but m fact no troops were sent to Iraq The possibility of an attack on the oil-fields and Abadan m case ot hostilities between His Majesty’s Government and the Soviet Union was studied, and plans for defence by British aircraft were drawn up, while rifles for the arming of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company personnel in certain eventualities were moved”down from Habbaniyah to Basra. All this is unknown to the Iranian authorities, who have limited themselves to measures designed to prevent sabotage in the oil area to a black-out, and to anti-aircraft preparations of no value. 28 The British community in Iran realise that what happens m and to Iran will depend very little on Iran herself. They have aii evacuation scheme ready knowing that out of vanity and reluctance to offend Germany the Iranian Government will not take any serious measures against the Iifth Column until it is too late, and that, if Russia should send troops into Iran, the Iranian army and people would offer no effective resistance even if the Shah was as populai a &amp; he is in fact detested.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT £53?) u/ R.ft * PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. ^une 17, 1942. Section 1. (16230) [E 3655/3655/34] Copy No. j \ 2 Sir R. Bullard to Mr. Eden.—(Received June 17.) gi r ^ Tehran, May 26. 1942. IN accordance with the instructions contained in the Right Hon. the Viscount Halifax’s circular despatch of the 4th November, 1939, I have the honour to transmit herewith a political report on Persia for the year 1941. Ihe report has been prepared with some difficulty. In the first place, most of the records for the period from the 1st January, 1941, until the occupation by Allied troops in August have been destroyed; in the second, Mr. Greenway, to whom I am indebted for a draft of a considerable portion of the report, wa J transferred, and it was some while before time could be found, by those who had a first-hand knowledge of the events of 1941, to bring the report to completion. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. Enclosure. Annual Political Report for 1941. FROM the beginning of 1941 until the invasion of Persia by the B rit i s h and Soviet troops in August mere were no serious attempts on the part of the Persian Government to take advantage of the difficulties of Great Britain or to lenew the pressure which had been applied in the previous year by the cancellation ot the credits agreements and the blackmailing of the A.LO.C. over the royalty question. The Shah, whose rigid policy of maintaining neutrality and ot pursuing his plan of economic development was stressed m the report on Persia for 1940 still hoped that he would be able to secure the maximum advantage from both sides. In accordance with this policy, therefore, his Government turned a deaf ear to British protests about the presence s u ia lar g® numbers of potentially dangerous Germans and to the risk to which both Butis and Persian interests were exposed by the presence of Axis merchant vessels laid up, with skeleton Axis crews, in Persian waters. This problem, which was to be solved so dramatically later in the year, was even at the beginning 01 1941 a source of considerable anxiety to His Majesty’s Government. In January His Majesty’s Minister renewed the representations which he had made without success in the previous year, and drew the attention of the Persian Government to the fact that, among the excessive number of so-called German specmhsts and business men, were many who were credibly believed to be German officers, and who had, in any case, no real connexion with the firms by whom they were nominally employed. The danger which this situation presented to Peisia as well as to Great Britain was stressed in vain; the Persian Government com placently replied that measures had already been taken to keep all Germans under surveillance, to send away some suspicious characters, and to grant visas to Germans desiring to enter Persia only at Tehran and after exhaustive enquiry. They calculated that these measures were amply sufficient to obviate any untoward incident. 2. There was, unfortunately, some ostensible justification tor the presence in Persia of many of the German specialists, since there was much machinery of German origin to be installed or maintained in connexion with the Shah s numerous industrial schemes; and the very fact that these men weie nominally employed in undertakings in which His Majesty had a personal financial interest made it impossible for his Government, who had long ceased to resist his will, • [24073] B 1to take more active steps, even had they wished to do so. Moreover, apart from their fear of the Shah, the Government showed increasing awe ol tne ax P owers, whom they were beginning to regard as invincible, while the enigma ic attitude of Russia was a source of no less misgiving. It is not altogetner surprising that the Persian Government, tormented by these thiee con ic i fears, had little consideration for Great Britain, of whose final victory they wei^ far from being convinced. Representations by His Majesty s Minister on c subject of the German and Italian ships lying at Bandar bhahpui (P. - the danger which they constituted, were received with equal complacency, l - Persian authorities, it was stated, had assured themselves that there were no explosives in these ships, and were unable to accept the British contention that security required either the replacement of the Axis crews by Persian 01 t removal of essential parts of the machinery In the event these assurances weie shown to be totally unjustified. When British troops captured Bandar Shahpur two of these ships were sunk by their crews by means of the explosives which, with or without Persian connivance, had been concealed on board. , , 3 Commercial relations between Persia and Germany were strengthe e by the signature at the end of January of a V/oces-verbalyvo^mg for the export to Germany during the financial year of over 100,000 of Persia produce including 20,000 tons of rice. 18,000 tons of cotton and 15,000 tons of barley as well as of 36,000 kilog. of opium, £4 million worth of skins and a laige quantity of carpets. About the same time the Persian Government requested His Maiesty’s Legation to assure the importation from India into Persia ot some 30 000' tons of wheat, and, on the strength of categorical assurances both from the Prime Minister and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that no wheat was being sent out of Persia, a licence for this order was se c ui ech When ha of the wlmat had arrived, however, it was reported on good authority that at least some Persian wheat was, in fact, being exported from northern ports and t ere was some reason to believe that this was being done by direct order of the Shah nossiblv without the knowledge of the Prime Minister. The Government of India therefore suspended the export of the wheat for some time but it wa eventually resumed in view of the shortage of bread in Persia, and of the certaintj which was established that the quantity of wheat exported from I ersia comd on.v haveten smalh^^ ^ Qf ^ of Rashi d All was viewed at first with considerable alarm by the Persian Government. They adopted an attitude of uneasy neutrality, but failed to control the activities of the German Legation, who organTsed the despatch of parties of Germans to Northern Iraq and Kurdistan to loin the rebel forces. The Government did, however, refuse a transit visa to the German Minister in Bagdad Herr Grobba, who wished to return to his post via Persia. Moreover, they refused on technical grounds the a nr pm ent as Iraqi Charge d’Affaires in Tehran of the fanatical Nationalist Talib Mushtaq; and they rejected the German demand that the Persian Goverm mpnt should refuse to allow British warships to station themselves m any part of the Shatt-el-Arab. On the 3rd June, after the rebellion had been crushed a large number of refugees from Iraq, including Rashid Ah himself and several of his Ministers the officers forming the “ Golden Square, and the ex-Mu i Jerusalem, reached Tehran, many of them in stolen cars They took up residence • n ^inciDal hotels pending arrangements for other accommodation and mmediateH put themselves in touch with the German and Italian Legations. Rashid All himself was finally permitted by the Persian Government to leave for Tnvlrpv where he was to reside on parole. • 1 5' His Majesty’s Minister made repeated representations to the Persian Government regarding the danger which these refugees constituted and f ri thev should he removed to provincial towns, where they could not 3fco™S “each other, wifh the Axis Legations, or with thetr r in Pprcdfi nnd other countries. The Persian Government did filially remove some of them to Zenian, whence, on the approach of the Russian forces, onTof the most dangerous, Salahuddin Sabbagh, succeeded in escaping; the others fl a n .Wu Tehran where they were subsequently arrested for deportation but I dtanneared^S On the 3rd September His Majesty’s Minister Sabbagh disappea p P ian Government to hand over the Iraqi, Palestinian inTl TianTefngL and ate some delay they agreed to do so. It was at first proposed that thf Iraqis should be handed over to the Iraq. Government for trial.[24073] B 2 but it was finally decided that they should be taken over by the British military authorities for internment in India or elsewhere. Accordingly, they were despatched with their families to Ahwaz and finally interned in Southern Rhodesia. The attitude of the Persian Government in regard to the ex-Mufti of Jerusalem was consistently unsatisfactory, but seems to have been the result of complacency rather than of deliberate obstruction. Sir R. Bullard continued to press for effective control of his movements, stressing the serious view taken by His Majesty’s Government, but received in reply only assurances that he was being held under the closest surveillance. Finally, the Persian Government agreed to send him to Yezd, but they were too late. At that moment the Russian troops were already advancing on Tehran, and the Mufti’s guards, sharing in the prevailing panic, and perhaps encouraged by Axis largesse, fled incontinently. The Mufti himself was not slow to follow their example, and all that is known for certain of his subsequent movements is that at one time he took refuge m the Japanese Legation, but left after a few days’ stay, though he may have returned there letter 6. By the end of July both His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India were becoming increasingly perturbed by the direct threat, both military and. political, which the German Fifth Column constituted for British and imperial interests. His Majesty’s Minister and the Soviet Ambassador were accordingly instructed to make parallel representations to the Persian Govern ment with a view to a substantial and immediate reduction in the Geiman community, which contained an alarmingly high proportion of notorious agents. At the same time His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India were in consultation as to the use of sanctions to be applied if diplomatic pressure failed in its object, their opinion being that economic sanctions would be ineffectual bv themselves and in any case would be too slow. On the 16th August' Sir R. Bullard and M. Smirnov addressed further representa tions to the Persian Government, accompanied by detailed memoranda. They requested the Persian Government to furnish details of tneir progiamme of reduction of the number of Axis nationals and lists of Germans who had already left or were about to leave the country; but stated that there was no objection to the retention of German specialists essential for the economic life of the country, provided that they were not personally suspect, and were not employed on communications or in departments where their presence would be dangerous. 7. On the 19th August the Persian Government replied with counter proposals on an extremely limited scale, coupled with a refusal to supply written details. This reply convinced His Majesty’s Government and the Soviet Government that nothing more was to be hoped for from continued negotiation, and accordingly at 4.15 a.m. on the 25th August the Allied representatives called on the Prime Minister and handed him notes showing that the patience of their Governments was exhausted. The British note, after summing up previous inconclusive negotiations, stated :— “It is evident that the Persian Government attach greater importance to retaining these German nationals in Persia than they attach to meeting the wishes of His Majesty’s Government .... The Persian Government must bear full responsibility for the consequences of their decision.’’ The note concluded by stating that His Majesty’s Government were obliged to take appropriate measures to safeguard their own vital interests and to deal with the menace arising from the potential activities of the Germans m Persia. These measures were in no way directed against the Persian people or the independence and territorial integrity of Persia. Military measures that might be taken were of a temporary nature only, and were directed solely against the A.xis Powers 8. Mr. Ali Mansour repeated previous assurances that all Germans would be deported, and said that the programme would be accelerated. Everything, he uro-ed could be arranged amicablv, if only the movements of British and Soviet troops, which had just been reported to him, could be countermanded. But his assurance, which was m any case of little \alue, came too late. Biitish and Russian troops met with very little resistance in their advance; some clashes, however, occurred in Khuzistan, in the course of which Admiral Bayandor, commanding the Persian navy, was killed. As a result of naval operations at Bandar Shahpur six out of the eight German and Italian merchant ships werer L Ufi seized and despatched within a week to India; while a seventh, which had been sunk, was raised and also taken to India. The eighth ship, which had been blown up by its crew, was a total loss. Those members of the German and, Italian crews who were at Bandar Shahpur were taken prisoner ; others, who were on holiday in Northern Persia, made good their escape, with the exception of a few4 individuals whose arrest His Majesty’s Legation were able to secure. I he half- dozen small gun-boats which constituted the Persian navy were either sunk or captured. It had not been expected that any great show of resistance would be made, owing to the low state of morale in the Persian armed forces, due to underfeeding, underpayment, lack of training in modern warfare, and an almost total absence of supply arrangements; but the rapid and complete demoralisation of the Persian troops, even of those not engaged in operations, came as a general surprise. Some divisions melted away completely, the officers leading the rout, and the rank and file abandoning or selling their arms, and making their way back to their villages. 9. During the night of August the 24th-25th His Majesty’s Minister, assuming from indirect evidence in his instructions that hostilities were about to begin, sent word to all British subjects in Tehran, who quickly assembled and took refuge in the legation compounds at Gulhek and in the city. Here they were joined by some nationals of a number of Allied States—Poles, Czechs, and Greeks; and even by some neutrals and some German Jews who professed strong pro-Ally sympathies. In all about 650 people were accommodated in the two legations and their gardens, where they remained for a fortnight. On the morning of the invasion the Shah sent for the British and Soviet representatives and asked what the two Governments wanted. They replied by referring to the text of the communications which they had, made to the Prime Minister that , morning. It was obvious that the invasion had been a very great shock to the \ Shah, who, as it seemed to them, had been ill-informed by his Ministers and had 1 been living in a world of unreality. The Shah compromised : on the one hand he issued an absurd war communiqud—No. I, never to be followed by No. II; At and on the other he dismissed Mr. Ali Mansour and appointed as Prime Minister ~ * V ^j; r Firoughi, almost the only statesman who was trusted completely for his honesty. Soon afterwards (the 28th August) the Shah issued the order to cease fire. Hostilities ceased on the British side also, but the Russians, who had already done a great deal of senseless damage by bombing undefended targets, kept up small-scale bombing for several days, first because the orders took a long- while to reach their air units, and afterwards because a Russian aeroplane which dropped pamphlets on Tehran was fired at by the Persians, who alleged that they were firing at two of their own aeroplanes whose pilots had refused to obey the order to cease fire. 10. Negotiations were at once entered into for the regularisation of the situation by an exchange of letters. The main objects on the Allied side were to fix the limits of occupation, to secure the delivery either to the British or Soviet forces of all the members of the German community except the bona fide staff of the German Legation and a few technicians not employed on communications or | military establishments; and to ensure that the despatch of supplies across Persia to Russia, including war material, would not be hindered. On their side. His Majesty’s Government agreed to continue to pay the oil royalties and to facilitate the supply to Persia of her economic requirements; and to halt the further advance of their troops and, as soon as the military situation should permit, to withdraw their forces from Persian territory. The first reply from the Persian Government had, however, hardly been received when the Allied Governments decided that they could not accept a solution under which the Axis Legations would be free to carry on in Tehran activities against both Persia and the Allies. Consequently, on the 6th September the British and Soviet representatives addressed notes to the Minister for Foreign Affairs pointing out that the Axis Legations and Governments had taken advantage of Allied forbearance in not occupying Tehran to indulge in anti-Allied propaganda, and asking that the German, Italian, Hungarian and Roumanian Legations should be removed at the earliest possible moment. His Majesty’s Minister added to this an oral request that the Bulgarian Legation should also be removed—-a request with which the Soviet Ambassador could not associate himself officially, since the Soviet and Bulgarian Governments were still in diplomatic relations with each other, though he was able to inform the Persian Government that he regarded ic Jc P »*«*»&gt;* „ t:£ K.-\ *5 them as having a free hand in the matter. The Persian Government agreed to get rid of the five missions, and stopped their cypher and bag facilities at once; but they were so dilatory in their preparations for the departure of the missions that the Allies decided to move troops to the capital as the only means of securing this object without dangerous delay. The troops arrived in the suburbs of Tehran (they never occupied the town itself) on the morning of the 16th September. The British troops camped on the south, the Russians on the other three sides of the town. In the course of the exchange of letters the Persian Government obtained permission to station Persian troops at certain points in the British zone of occupation (not in the Russian), but they tried in vain to secure the immediate return of war material captured during the hostilities and a promise of compensa tion for war damage. Although these letters were set aside by the occupation of Tehran and the negotiations for the conclusion of a treaty, they set the tone for the mutual relations of His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government for the rest of the year. 11. The British zone of occupation, as defined in the exchange of letters, was to be bounded by a line running north and east of Kermanshah and Kurramabad and of the oilfields of Masjid-i-Sulaiman, Haftkel and Gach Saran, and ending at Bandar Dulaim, on the Persian Gulf; but British troops were already in occupation of Hamadan, the Aveh Pass and Sultanabad when the negotiations began, and these points remained in our occupation after the troops which were sent to occupy the suburbs of the capital had been withdrawn. The limits of the Russian occupation (apart from the period when the Russian troops were at Tehran) have been as defined in the letters : the line runs from Ushni through Zenjan to Qazvin, then up to the Caspian, whose southern shore it follows, then through Babul, Zirab, Semnan and Shahrud and north to Aliabad, on the frontier. There is, however, one exception to this : at the last moment the Russians added to their definition an oral statement that, while Meshed would not be occupied, a certain number of aeroplanes, with ground troops to protect them, would be stationed outside Meshed. This was an important rider, since the presence of Russian troops so near naturally affected the administration of Meshed, the centre of an important province. 12. Even before the Allied entry into Persia it had been debated whether it paid us any longer to support Reza Shah to the extent we had done in the past, viz., by discouraging the publication in the British press of any matter disparaging him or his regime. His Majesty’s Government fully realised that the popular belief, that we maintained him on the throne for our own ends, did us great harm, but they considered that his remarkable hold over his people warranted his retention on the throne so long as we could hope to secure his co-operation, or at least his real neutrality. His obstinate refusal to get rid of the Axis nationals with reasonable speed had already shaken our hopes when the Allied occupation showed that he was quite incapable of dealing with the problems of the moment. When his parade army collapsed he made no effort to prevent disintegration. Moreover, he showed no consciousness of responsibility for the collapse of his pretentious military fagade, or of recognition of the urgent need for reform : even after the occupation he one day beat the Minister of Warjj X and the Chief of Staff with his sword for putting up a scheme of which hej disapproved, and threw them into prison, and he would probably have had them executed if he had not had to abdicate. Meanwhile our position had grown worse, since whereas the Persians expected that we should at least save them from the Shah’s tyranny as compensation for invading their country, they found that they now had to bear both the foreign occupation and the Shah. The new Prime Minister, Mr. Fimmhi, though he realised that it would be impossible to find a successor to Reza who would wield the same authority, eventually came to the conclusion that the reforms which were essential could not be secured under Reza Shah, since, even if he promised to accept a programme of reform, he would soon return to his old arbitrary ways and penalise the authors of the programme. His Majesty’s Government thereupon agreed that the B.B.C. might now begin to give various broadcasts in Persian which had been prepared beforehand, starting with talks on constitutional government and increasing in strength and local colour until all Reza’s mismanagement, greed and cruelty were displayed to the public gaze. It is probable that no broadcasts have ever been received with more excitement and approval than these. If the Persian public approved them, to the Shah they gave a violent shock, and he made an unsuccessful appeal toHis Majesty’s Minister that these broadcasts should cease. Encouraged by the lead given by the the Deputies in the Majlis, who had been subservient for so many years, passed a resolution addressed to the Shah, asking for reforms. A deputation of them was to wait upon the Shah on the 16th September, resolved^ it was alleged, to ask him to abdicate; but it is quite possible that in view ot ( the fear in which they held him they would have withdrawn their request or been put oil with promises. Early that morning, however, the tShah received news that Russian forces were advancing from Qazvin, and he signed a deed of abdication, drafted by Mr. Firoughi, in favour of the Crown Prince, and retired to Isfahan, where a few days later he signed another deed, this time transferring his property in Persia to the new Shah. 13. Events moved so rapidly towards the end that the Shah had been replaced by his eldest son before His Majesty’s Government had been able to decide who would be the most suitable successor. The Persians were divided among themselves : some wanting to get rid of the Pahlevi dynasty altogether (though not to go back to the Qajars), some preferring the third or the fourth son (though never the second) to the eldest, or even wishing to have one of the two youngest, aged 9 and 6 respectively, under a Regency. In the end the eldest son succeeded because that was in accord with the Constitution and therefore less open to objection than any other course. His Majesty’s Government had hesitated to commit themselves beforehand. The Crown Prince had been carefully excluded by his father from participating in the work of government and even from contact with the public and the foreign representatives, so that his character and abilities were alike unknown to His Majesty’s Government. Moreover, he had a reputation of being pro-German, which was perhaps unjustified and, in any case, was never confirmed by anything that happened after his accession. His Majesty’s Minister and the Soviet Ambassador could think of no better candidate, and Mr. Firoughi, who was well disposed towards the Allies, forecasted a constitutional regime under which the Shah would have little power. His Majesty’s Government, therefore, agreed that Mohamed Reza should be given a trial subject to good behaviour, which would include the granting of extensive reforms, the restoration to the nation of the property illegally acquired by his father, and the exclusion of all his brothers from Persia. One of his first acts on assuming the throne was to send messages to Sir Reader Bullard, assuring him of his whole-hearted and loyal co-operation with Great Britain.’ At the same time, he enquired privately whether it was the intention of His Majesty’s Government to allow a Persian, Government to administer the country, or whether the British and Russian Governments themselves proposed to do this; and stressed the fact that no Persian Government could be expected to control the country when the capital was surrounded by Allied troops. 14. To dispose of the old Shah was no easy matter. The Prime Minister, Mr. Firoughi, feared that, if he stayed in the country, he would not be able to refrain from interference in the Government. The Shah himself wished to go to South America, and an application, v^hich was eventually granted, was made to the Argentine Government, for permission for him to live there. Meanwhile, he wished to go to India, but the Government of India were unwilling that he should make even a temporary stay in that country. Eventually His Majesty’s Government sent a vessel to Bandar Abbas for the Royal party, which included all the sons except the eldest, as well as two daughters and one of the Queens. The vessel called at Bombay, where the party were, however, not allowed to land, and then proceeded to Mauritius. The Shah appears to have brought a charge of bad faith against His Majesty’s Government, who thereupon sent him through the Viceroy a telegram saying that they had never agreed that he mi^ht go to South America with his family; the decision that he should remain temporarily in Mauritius was based on the requirements of the war situation; there was no intention of treating him as a prisoner. The new Shah showed great anxiety both for his father’s health and his brothers’ education, and he asked whether they could not be allowed to go to some place in the British Empire, e.g,, Canada or South Africa. His Majesty’s Government sent the Shah a statement explaining why they had at first held it better that his father should remain in Mauritius until the end of the war. viz., that he would there be free from Nazi agents and propagandists, journalists and political intrigues; but by the end of the year arrangements had been made for the ex-Shah to reside in Canada.7 15. The approach of Russian troops to Tehran spread panic among all classes, and the Government were galvanised into giving last-minute, though quite inadequate, assistance to the efforts of His Majesty’s Legation to discover the whereabouts of Axis agents and the other members of the Axis communities, and to arrange for their immediate removal from Persia, together with that of -x the Axis Legations. On the 17tih September the German Minister and his staff left for Germany via Tabriz, together with several hundred German women and children, whose husbands had already been or were about to be deported. The journey of this convoy, for which transport was only provided with the greatest • difficulty by the Persian authorities, was slow and difficult; and there is little doubt mat the travellers were treated extremely badly by the Russian forces through whose lines they passed, especially when they reached the frontier, where the Russians seized all the foreign currency and most of the personal belongings of the non-diplomats and all the luggage of the members of the legation which was not with its owners in the diplomatic cars. The Roumanian Charge d’Affaires and his staff left for Bucharest via Bagdad, and the Bulgarian Legation for Sofia via Tabriz. Two days later the Italian Legation, with several hundred members of the community, left for the Turkish frontier. They received far better treatment than the Germans at the hands of the Russians. 16. Meanwhile, every effort was being made to round up the remaining Germans in the face of many difficulties. It was, however, decided to allow a s^J certain number, nearly all of whom were Jew’s, known or believed on good grounds j to be hostile to the Nazi regime, to remain at least temporarily in Iran. Unfortunately, the two principal German agents, Gamotta and Mayr, who were believed to have played an important part in the Iraqi rebellion, were not to be traced. It was believed that at one time they took refuge in the Japanese Legation, which certainly gave shelter to the Murti of Jerusalem. The continued efforts of His Majesty’s Legation, willingly but ineffectually seconded by the Persian police, to lay hands on these three dangerous individuals were without effect. Whether they left the country could not be ascertained, but in any case no acts of sabotage occurred such as they might have been expected to arrange, I and it is not necessary to presuppose the presence of Germans in Persia to account for the pro-German propaganda w T hich began to be heard on all sides. 17. On the 27th September the ex-Shah embarked at Bandar Abbas with the ex-Queen Consort and seven members of the Royal family. All his real property had in the meantime been transferred to the State by the new Shah, who also made over to various charitable objects a considerable sum out of the large fortune (600 million rials) lying in his father’s name in the Banque Mellie. 18. Meanwhile, in the region of Tehran, the discipline of the Russian troops, which had at first been exemplary, deteriorated somewhat: though as they received no pay that could be spent in Persia, wdiere they saw in the shops watches and other articles unobtainable in Russia, there was an explanation, if not an excuse, for thefts and robberies which they may have committed. In the districts under Russian occupation it became almost impossible for the Persian authorities to maintain order, as the Soviet authorities first disarmed the police and gendarmerie and then refused to help to maintain order on the ground that this would constitute interference in the civilian administration. Eventually an agreement was concluded for the rearming of a given number of police and gendarmes in occupied zones, but there were disputes as to the execution of this agreement. The attitude of the Soviet authorities was attributed by the Persians to a definite policy of weakening the authority of the Central Government and of preparing the soil for suitable ideological propaganda. 19. In the capital itself panic, defeatism and despair were growing daily stronger. Criticism of the Government was almost universal, though none of the critics seemed ready to help with criticism that was not purely destructive. The Mollas raised their reactionary heads again, every merchant in the bazaar was prepared to accept the post of Minister of Finance, every lawyer to be Minister of Justice, and intrigue of every kind was rife; and in the chaotic conditions inevitable in the sudden change-over from pure despotism to an alleged consti tutional and democratic regime there was a general scramble for the fruits, though not for the responsibilities, of privilege and office. 20. As a result of these conditions, British popularity, which had flared up for a moment when the Shah was removed, rapidly declined once more. We were almost universally blamed, chiefly for the excesses, real or alleged, of the Russianr. - 8 « troops and for their very presence on Persian soil; but also for the incompetence, mismanagement and continued corruption of the Persian administration. The widespread shortage of wheat, sugar and other essential commodities was easily attributed to the selfish British, and no credit was for a moment given for the supplies which were despatched to Persia in considerable quantities and in ships badly needed for other purposes. For the growth of this feeling a skilful pro-German propaganda, and in particular the daily broadcasts in Persian from^* Berlin, was partly to blame, but it has become almost automatic in Persia to attribute to Great Britain the responsibility for any unpleasant event that may occur. Even the Persian Government, who were in possession of all the facts, though pressed continually by His Majesty’s Minister to give them publicity in the press and on the wireless, supinely preferred to occupy themselves with other matters, regardless of the fact that their own prestige was receiving a corres ponding set-back. The abdication of Reza Shah gave a momentary fillip to our reputation, but the inconveniences and privations resulting from the war in general and from the occupation in particular, soon reduced us to the position of permanent villain in Persian eyes. 21. It was in these unfavourable circumstances that negotiations for a treaty of alliance between Persia, Great Britain and Soviet Russia were launched on their long and tortuous course. The proposal had originated with His Majesty’s Government even before the overthrow of Reza Shah, and had the personal approval of the Prime Minister, Mr. Firoughi, and Sir R. Bullard was instructed on the 14th September to inform Mr. Firoughi and his Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Soheily, of the desire of the Allied Powers to conclude such a treaty, negotiations for which might be initiated as soon as the question of the Axis Legations and communities was satisfactorily solved. Mr. Firoughi promised to work to that end immediately on the conclusion of the constitutional crisis which had arisen out of the abdication of the Shah. On the 1st October a copy of the draft text, which had been drawn up in London, was communicated unofficially to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. At the same time, in order to create a more favourable atmosphere, the question of withdrawing British and Soviet troops from Tehran was under consideration. On the 6th October, however, Mr. Soheily addressed identical and somewhat peremptory notes to Sir R. Bullard and M. Smirnov, requesting the evacuation of Tehran and its neighbourhood in order to ally public anxiety, restore security and permit the Persian Government to carry on with the administration of the country. These notes were obviously directed against the Soviet Government and had an unfortunate effect on M. Smirnov, which did not predispose him to treaty negotia tions, though he had hitherto appeared to share the opinion of His Majesty’s Minister, that the proximity of the Allied troops to the capital tended to demomlise the Persian Government and to create the risk that the Allies might be dragged into the administration first of Tehran and then of the whole country. The Soviet Government, however, accepted the British draft treaty, which was communicated to the Persian Government officially on the 17th October. On the same day British and Russian troops withdrew from the neighbourhood of Tehran. , ^ . 22. The examination of the draft by the Persian Government was now adversely affected by the Russian withdrawal in the Ukraine, which, to the minds of the majority of the Persians, seemed likely to result in th$ early occupation of the Caucasus by the German forces. When the German community was ejected from Persia, they departed with loud assurances that they would return in three months. This fear of the return of infuriated Germans bent on revenge for their summary dismissal was artfully fomented from abroad by the Berlin broadcasts in Persian, and from within by agents, of whom the great majority were them selves Persians, certain of the invincibility of German arms, seduced by German gold, and looking for reward, or at least hoping for immunity if the country should be occupied by the Germans. Moreover, it seemed certain that to reconcile the Persian public to an alliance with the traditional enemy—'Russia—would prove an almost superhuman task in view of the reports (usually exaggerated) of the behaviour of the Russian troops. The Prime Minister himself was old. tired and preoccupied with grave problems of internal security, food shortage and a financial deficit. Universally respected though he was, he had neither the physical strength nor the forceful personality necessary to reconcile the divisions in a pusillanimous Cabinet. The negotiations initiated in this uneasy atmos-[24073] c 9 phere recalled those which led up to the conclusion in a.d. 363 of the Treaty of Dura, as to which Gibbon observes :— “ The crafty Persian delayed, under various pretences, the conclusion of the agreement, started difficulties, required explanations, suggested ✓v expedients, receded from his concessions, increased his demands, and wasted days in the arts of negotiation.” — Painful experience was to demonstrate 1,600 years later that the modern Persian has lost no whit of the cunning of his ancestors; while the laborious processes of parliamentary procedure, imperfectly understood even by the Ministers of State, caused an unexpected delay of yet another month at the last moment. The Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and a few colleagues who were not insensible to the advantages which the treaty would bring to their country did their inefficient best to pass it through a corrupt and grasping Majlis; but the determination of the Prime Minister to allow a full and free discussion of the treaty, so that no one could subsequently accuse him of having passed it through under pressure, and the fear and greed of the Deputies, so far impeded the progress of negotiations that at the end of the year the treaty itself, though initialled by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 15th December, was still far from receiving the endorsement of the National Assembly. 23. The treaty as initialled in December and as signed in the following month (for the only result of the subsequent debates in the Majlis was the addition of an annex of no great importance) contained undertakings by Great Britain and the Soviet Union to respect the territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Persia, jointly and severally to defend Persia from all aggression on the part of Germany or any other Power, to withdraw their troops from Persian territory not later than six months after the conclusion of hostilities or of peace, whichever should be the earlier, and to do their best to safeguard the economic existence of the Persian people against the privations and difficulties arising out of the present war. On their side, the Persian Government undertook to co-operate with the All ms in the defence of Persia, the assistance of the Persian forces being limited, however, to the maintenance of internal security on Persian territory; to give the Allies full facilities and assistance (1) for the passage of troops or supplies from one to the other, (2) in the matter of communications, and (3) in securing material and labour; and to co-operate in the censorship measures required. The Persian Government also gave the Allies the right to maintain in Persian territory land, sea and air forces in such number as they might consider necessary. 24. As originally drafted by the Foreign Office, the treaty required the assistance of the Persian forces in the defence of Persia, though only on Persian soil, but the Cabinet feared that this would frighten the population and preferred a less dignified provision restricting the role of the Persian army to the maintenance of internal order—a provision which only the Shah, and perhaps some army officers, seemed to consider derogatory to the Persian army. The Persian Government secured various minor amendments designed either to spare the susceptibilities of the Persian people or to compel the Allies (and particu larly the Russians) not to interfere in the internal administration or with the normal economic life of the people, and they induced His Majesty’s Government to reduce from twelve to six months the period during which the Allied troops must leave Persia after the war. There was much debate about article 6. Each- side undertook not to adopt in its relations with foreign countries an attitude prejudicial to the other, and, in addition, the Allies undertook to consult the Persian Government in all matters affecting the direct interests of Persia. The Persian Government tried in vain to enlarge the scope of this last provision in order to secure full representation at any peace conference or conferences. His Majesty’s Government, for reasons, some of which it would not have been expedient to explain to the Persian Government the possible effect upon Egypt and Iraq), could not go so far, but the Allies did give some satisfaction to Persia in an annex which included the assurance that they would do their best to ensure that Persia should be represented on a footing of equality in any peace negotiations directly affecting her interests. An important annex (No. 2) consisted of a letter to be addressed to the British and Soviet representatives in Persia by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, stating that the Persian Government would consider it contrary to their obligations under the clause about iMHHthe attitude to be adopted towards foreign Powers, to maintain diplomatic relations with any State which was in diplomatic relations with neither of the Allied Powers. This wording was adopted so as to prevent the closing of, e.g., the Netherlands Legation, whose Government was not in diplomatic relations with the Soviet Government, but it was defective in one important respect: it secured the closing of the Vichy Legation, but not the closing of the Japanese' Legation, which had to be secured later by other means. The treaty provided for the conclusion of subsidiary agreements of an economic and financial nature. The Persian Government wished to embody in the treaty some of the favours they had in mind, but the Allied Governments would not commit themselves in advance. 24a. While the treaty negotiations were in progress the Prime Minister effected minor changes in the Government, which had been accused by the people, not without reason, of representing the old regime of oppression, corruption and subservience to the will of a despot. Popular clamour was directed even more loudly against the Majlis, on the same grounds and with even greater justification. The Prime Minister, however, hesitated to dissolve the Majlis, not only because this could not have been effected without a technical breach of the Constitution, but also because he feared that the areas in Soviet occupation might return Communist Deputies. 25. The Government that found itself responsible for the conduct of affairs after the abdication of Reza Shah had no lack of problems on its hands. It had to regularise its relations with the Allies and to struggle with the criticism released by the fall of the despot; while the problems of the food supply, the financial situation and the growing insecurity in various parts of the country gave them no respite. 26. The late Shah’s short-sighted economic policy, whereby the staple occupation of the country, viz., agriculture, was neglected and an ill-conceived and over-rapid programme of industralisation was pursued without regard to its effect upon the population, had been leading up to a crisis for some years. There was already a warning sign in the winter of 194CMJ, when the huge silos erected at so great expense stood empty and wheat had to be imported from India. Local wheat production had fallen off, partly because the Shah encouraged the growing of cotton and sugar-beet without increasing the supply of water, but mainly because, in order to keep down the price of bread in the towns, he fixed so low a price for the compulsory purchase of surplus stocks that the wheat- grower tended to limit sowings to his own needs. In normal times it would have been easy to make up the shortage by imports from outside, but not only was shipping short throughout the year, but there was the serious interruption resulting from the occupation by foreign troops, and by local disturbances in which grain was often stolen or hidden. Sugar, of which Persia normally used to import some 80,000 tons, was also short, because of the shipping shortage and the long distance between Persia and the normal source of supply, Java; and this shortage was accentuated by the lack of security and of internal transport after the occupation, which resulted in a reduction of the quantity of sugar beet carried to the factories. Great efforts were made by His Majesty’s Govern ment, on grounds both of humanity and of policy, to send supplies of wheat and sugar to Persia as soon as possible after the occupation, and by the end of the year they had despatched about 45,000 tons of wheat and 36,000 tons of sugar, of which about 38,000 and 15,000 tons respectively had been already landed at Persian ports. This creditable result did not prevent the Persian broadcasters from Berlin from alleging that the Allies, and especially the British, were removing food supplies from Persia, and these allegations easily secured acceptance in the suspicious minds of many Persians; and on one occasion the mistaken belief that it was the British military authorities who were removing from Hamadan wheat, which was, in fact, taken away by the Persian Government for the civil population elsewhere, led to a hostile demonstration, in which stones were flung by Persians at British troops, who eventually had to fire, and thereby caused the death of several of the demonstrators. Publication of the facts, and ocular evidence eventually weakened, if it did not eradicate, the belief that His Majesty’s Government were taking the Persian’s food away. 27. The financial situation was already bad at the time of the occupation. The budget for the current year was largely imaginary, and the new Minister of Finance estimated that income had been over-estimated by some 500 million rials and expenditure underestimated by a like amount. The falling-off of[24073] D 11 imports reduced seriously the yield from customs duties—a tendency which increased when the military operations of August brought about a temporary break-down in the customs and frontier administrations; while the military and political events of the period combined to create an atmosphere of uncertainty and lawlessness particularly unfavourable to the regular collection of taxes of ^^ny kind. Ihe attitude of the Soviet authorities was also unhelpful. One of their lirst acts, after the occupation, was to require the Persian Government to open in their favour a credit of 80 million rials. Under the agreement concluded this sum was to be wiped off by the importation of Soviet goods for the Persian Government, but although some goods—including some wheats—were imported, the Soviet authorities sold them to merchants in order to secure rials, thereby not only leaving the credits outstanding, but also pocketing the taxes which ought to have been collected by the Persian Government. The Persian Govern ment effected some economies, e.g., by stopping work on some of the less important industrial schemes in progress, but these were offset by large increases of pay gTanted to the army and the civil service as an encouragement to honesty, binding themselves in this financial morass, the Government tended to look to the Allies (especially to His Majesty’s Government) to extricate them by means of vaguely-conceived financial and economic assistance to be afforded under the supplementary agreements provided for in the treaty. 28. There is one virtue that no one denies Reza Shah : in his reign law and order were maintained as never before in Persia. The roads were safe, and the severe treatment which had been meted out to the tribes and the removal of all the more important leaders to other districts kept down the tribal troubles which for many years before his accession had kept the Central Government in a chronic state of paralysis. Within a month or so the situation changed. A foreign invasion weakened the authority of the Tehran Government and of the local administrations; the gendarmerie, hated for their depredations (the harassed population made no allowance for the fact that the gendarme’s wage was not enough to live on and that his officers stole a large part even of that wage), found themselves faced with growing resentment, while the authority on which it had rested was melting away; Reza Shah abdicated, and his army disintegrated; the desertion of thousands 'of men from the army, with their arms, supplied with modern rifles large stretches of country which had for years been almost com pletely disarmed; and the release by the Government of most of the tribal leaders who had been kept in Tehran in prison or under supervision, while it did credit to the reforming zeal of the Firoughi Government, created here and there centres of ambition and discontent which were full of danger to the State—a danger accentuated by the fact that one or two leaders which not even M. Firoughi fad intended to release, e.g., Nasir Khan of the Qashgai&lt; managed to escape. It is not surprising that in these circumstances the roads in the unoccupied areas became unsafe. The least safe was probably the road from Isfahan to Bushire. His Majesty’s Legation lent their assistance by encouraging the Government to remove the most corrupt and brutal of the gendarmerie officers.and, when the law raising the pay of all public servants was finally passed, to see that the gendarmes received the increase. The rehabilitation of the army was a more serious business, and it is fortunate for the Persian Government that only in Kurdistan were its troops called upon during the first few months of the new regime to undertake serious military operations. 29. The number of men in the army had been greatly reduced by desertion during and immediately after the invasion, and the problem was how to fill the gaps. Conscription was perhaps the most deeply hated of all Persian institutions, mainly because of the corruption of the recruiting officers, and His Majesty’s Legation, like very many Persians, would have liked to see it replaced by a system of voluntary recruitment. Most of the Persian officers, however, maintained that even if the army was to be reduced considerably below its former figure, if could not be maintained by voluntary recruitment; to pay rates which would attract recruits would be too costly, and even then it would be the out-of-work in the towns who would enlist, and not the peasants, who were the best material. An attempt—no one can say how serious—was actually made to find voluntary recruits to fill some of the gaps, but only a few score men were secured in this way. The country, therefore, returned reluctantly to conscription, but owing partly to prevailing disorder, partly to the Russian refusal to allow conscription to be applied in the provinces occupiedi 12 by their troops, and partly to the fact that large parts of the tribal areas were not in effective control, conscription could be applied only to the unfortunate few, and the ranks of the army were still considerably depleted at the end of the year. 30. Half-hearted efforts were made to restrict the worst abuses in the application of conscription and in the army generally; certain of the moi^rv notoriously corrupt officers of the old regime were retired; a few well-educateu senior officers with relatively good moral reputations, but lacking the force of character of their unprincipled predecessors, were brought into the General Staff at Army Headquarters; and various schemes of reorganisation to suit the limiced role of responsibility for internal security only that had been allotted to the army in the draft treaty were discussed and put on paper. The hollowness of the army’s pretensions and its unworthiness of the admirable modern equipment with which it had been furnished at enormous expense to the country had been shamefully exposed by its performance in the face of Russian and British troops. No one could expect that the Persians should fight to annihilation against two powerful enemies, but that does not excuse the officers who. with some honourable exceptions, fled the field—usually in order .of seniority—without thought for their men. The defects in the army were clear even to the Persians themselves. On the moral side they were an absence of a sense of duty on the part of the officers, either to their country or their men, and on the part of the soldier in the ranks dislike and distrust of his officers. On the material side there was a complete lack of services for the supply of rations or munitions to troops in action, or for the treatment and evacuation of sick and wounded. 31 Only drastic action could hope to remedy the moral defects so flagrantly exposed, but the army had been for so long a law unto itself and free from any control except that of the ex-Shah, that no Minister could be found with sufficient courage to grasp the nettle. Moreover, the young Shah, who had himself been trained as an officer and had consequently deeply felt its humiliation, was also an obstacle, for although he admitted to His Majesty’s Minister that there was corruption and cruelty in the army, he was inclined to resent concrete criticism or the suggestion that his corps of officers needed heavy pruning and some exemplary punishment. 32. Appeal was made to His Majesty’s Legation to assist in remedying the material defects. The most urgent need was for transport to give the army some mobility and so to avoid the necessity of maintaining large garrisons in numerous detachments in the provinces.^ Our military authorities were, however, too short of transport themselves to justify holding out any hope to the Persian Government of any motor vehicles being available in the near future. 33. By October the disintegration and demoralisation of the Persian forces « had reached a very low level. Desertions with arms were so common that in most units the arms were kept permanently under lock and key. Sufficient reliable troops could not be found to provide parties to pursue deserters or to operate against brigands. Officers were sullen and defeatist. By the end of the year there had been some slight improvement, which showed itself in a reduction in the number of desertions and a slightly less passive attitude in the face of rebels and robbers. 34. Although there are in the army officers with sufficient technical knowledge to plan the necessary reforms and re-organisation, it was obvious that those who had the will to carry them out had little hope of success in any reasonable time without the help of a mission of foreign advisers. The main task of the latter would be to check abuses, to restore morale, to endeavour to eliminate the strong pro-German sentiments and to soothe the resentful feelings of the humiliated officers. 35. By the end of the year no progress had been made towards securing such a mission. In the army there was some strong opposition—Persian military vanity does not readily admit the need for foreign- advice; but there is little doubt that a mission of. say, American officers would find considerable support within the army. Without considering possible Russian objections, it was held that a mission of British officers could effect little owing to the ill-feeling towards the British that was regrettably common within the army. This is due to the humiliation that it had undergone and its consequent sense of inferiority; to resentment at our association with the Russians; and to its admiration for German achievements.[24073] D 2 lo mm 36. Little improvement was effected in this respect, but by the end of the year the General Staff were evolving a scheme of re-organisation into small mixed brigades which, if the necessary transport could be found, seemed well suited to present needs. 31^ 37. The necessity to define our attitude towards the tribes was made Evident even before the occupation, when a Qashguli chief approached His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Shiraz and offered his services to the British Government. It was accentuated after the occupation, when signs of tribal unrest appeared immediately in Ears, Dashti and Tangistan, and above all in Southern Kurdistan, where the Persian officials fled or were ejected and the area remained in the hands of the Kurds, who not only indulged their tendency to pillage but showed clear signs of an intention to use the opportunity to keep their country free from Persian control in future. During the visit of General Wavell to Tehran at the end of September the question of our attitude to the tribes was discussed in the light of the instructions of His Majesty’s Government that our object must be to get the civil administration running again. As a result of this discussion, in which the General Officer Commanding. Iraq, as well as members of the Legation staff with long experience of provincial Persia took part, it was unanimously decided that it was undesirable to encourage the tribes because a policy of encouragement would work against our attempt to keep the administration running and would involve us in family and sectional intrigues to little purpose, since serious tribal resistance to a German advance was not to be expected; and, moreover, the example of the Sheikh of Mohammerah stood as a warning against holding out to the tribes any promise of support against the central Government. It was. however, agreed that there was nothing to prevent our paying tribal leaders or elements for specific services such as handing over Germans or helping to protect the oil wells. * 38. This policy was approved by His Majesty’s Government, and during the rest of the year there was no reason to regret its adoption. Had there been any sign that we were encouraging the tribes it would have aroused the suspicion and hostility of the Persians, and particularly of the Persian army, who, having quelled the tribes once, did not wish to have to risk their lives in suppressing them a second time. Our attitude, which involved giving all moral support to the Persian Government in its efforts to restore order while at the same time urging them to take serious steps to remedy tribal grievances, was particularly necessary in regard to Kurdistan, where any encouragement given by us to the Kurds would also have given great offence to the Turkish Government, who, having had what almost amounted to a civil war with the Turkish Kurds a few years before, would have regarded encouragement of the Persian Kurds as a direct incitement to the Kurds in Turkey. That this is not exaggerated is proved by the suspicion and anxiety with which the Turkish Government regarded events in Azerbaijan, where they believed that the Soviet authorities were lending at least passive encouragement to the Kurds by preventing the Persian Government from using adequate armed forces to maintain order, and where the visit of a considerable number of Kurdish chiefs to Baku in response to a Soviet invitation suggested that the encouragement was to some extent positive. Towards the end of^the year it seemed to His Majesty’s Legation that some open step must be taken to dissociate His Majesty’s Government from the claims which some of the Kurdish leaders w6re undoubtedly making in order to secure support, that the Kurdish movement was viewed with sympathy by the British. ‘Accordingly, a statement was printed and eventually dropped over the areas in revolt by Persian aeroplanes, stating that the policy of His Majesty’s Government was to encourage the Persian Government to restore their authority in Kurdistan while redressing all legitimate grievances of the population; and specifically denying that any support was being given to the rebel leader, Hama Rashid. This statement gave satisfaction to the Turkish and Persian Governments, though the Persians considered that our statement ought to have repudiated all the Kurdish rebels and not simplv Hama Rashid. Hama (or Muhammad) Rashid was. however, the mainspring of the Kurdish revolt. He is believed to be of Iraqi origin, but he used to own considerable properties in Persian Kurdistan : these were taken from him in the time of Reza Shah and he had taken refuge in Iraq. He visited His Majesty’s Embassy in Bagdad in October, where he sought for sympathy and declared that never again would the Kurds accept Persian rule, but, in spite of the discouraging reply he received he nevertheless entered Persia and embarkedupon military operations against the Persians which were still in progress at the end of the year. These operations went rather better than we had expected, partly because an ineffective General Officer Commanding, Muqaddam, was replaced by a more active man, Shahbakhti, and partly because we not only gave no encouragement to the Kurds but, by releasing our Persian prisoners of war, by collecting and handing over to the Persians considerable quantities of rifles which had been given or sold to the population by deserting Persian troops, and by strengthening the morale of the Persian officers by our general attitude, we helped to get the Persian army on its feet again. 39. It is curious that after the efforts made by His Majesty's Government for so many decades to keep the Russians beyond the northern frontiers of Persia, a joint Anglo-Russian occupation of Persia should have been brought about mainly at the instigation of His Majesty’s Government. The occupation was necessary, in order to root out the strong Axis influence in Persia and to establish com munications for supplies to Russia; but the fact that the British and Russian forces were brought into direct contact, and in Persia above all places, created a situation which called for careful handling. British and Russian troops operated in Persia in the 191T-18 war, but before serious contact was established the Kerensky revolution had occurred, the Russian army was beginning to disintegrate, and a serious difference between Russian and British interests was no longer to be feared. In 1941 the situation was quite different. 40. The Russians seem to have used unduly violent measures, and to have prolonged them unnecessarily, when they occupied the Northern Provinces; they also requisitioned motor transport, both public and private, very greedily and never returned it; and they carried off about 250 Persian officers whom they eventually decided to keep in detention until the treaty should be signed; but their behaviour as an occupying Power was, on the whole, surprisingly good. The Persians were disposed to believe and to spread the wildest stories of Russian atrocities, and such incidents as the removal of the furniture from a Persian Government building, or an occasional robbery by a Red soldier during the occupation of the suburbs of Tehran, were multiplied and exaggerated by fear and malevolence. Even wilder reports seem to have been spread outside Persia, and His Majesty’s Legation were called upon to report on alleged massacres of Persians and acts of sacrilege at the Shiah shrines—stories without any founda tion whatsoever. Perhaps the worst feature of the Soviet occupation was the treatment of the forces of law and order. There is something to be said for the exclusion of Persian troops, whose officers were believed to be on the whole pro- German, from the areas occupied by the Soviet forces, but it is difficult to defend the Soviet policy of first disarming the gendarmerie and police and then refusing to assist in the maintenance of order on the ground that this would be interference in the internal affairs of Persia. Slowly and grudgingly the Soviet authorities gave permission for the rearmament of the gendarmerie and police, but they limited the number of both, and at Tabriz towards the end of the year they suddenly declared that, the number of police at Tabriz and other towns was in excess of the agreed figure and must be reduced forthwith. The controversy on this point was still going on at the end of the year. From the economic point of view the Russian occupation was alleged by the Persian Government to be disastrous, and in spite of the fact that the Russians imported certain quantities of wheat, sugar and piece-goods for the civil population, their influence on the economic life of the country would seem to have been in the main bad. The devices which they used in order to obtain rials for which they could not have produced foreign exchange, have been described above (paragraph 27); thev internreted in a manner most advantageous to themselves the definition of “ German goods,” considering as still German all goods of German origin found in the customs, and as already German any goods of Persian origin, wherever found, which it had been intended to export to Germany, This led to innumerable complaints by the Persian Government, who alleged privately that the only claimants who ever obtained satisfaction were those who paid bribes to the Soviet officials concerned. The country north of the Tabriz-Tehran-Meshed line, which normally contributes about two-thirds of the total revenue of Persia, paid very little in taxes after the occupation, and this was attributed to the fact that where not occupied it was at least influenced by Soviet troops. Moreover, no wheat came to Tehran from Azerbaijan, which is in normal times one of its main sources of supply, and this blocking of the normal channel of food was certainlysupported by the Soviet authorities, who alleged that there was, in fact, no surplus of wheat in Azerbaijan. 41. The Russians were naturally accused by the Persians of having political designs upon the north of Persia, at least upon Azerbaijan, though it seems ^mlikely that the Soviet Government would decide to remain in occupation of ^iYzerbaijan at the end of the war, in violation of the pledges in the draft treaty, when it would be just as easy to stir up trouble in Persia at any later time and to find a humanitarian pretext for the spontaneous adhesion of Azerbaijan to the Soviet Union. There was, in fact, litttle sign of any coherent Soviet policy. In December the Turkish Ambassador stated that the Soviet Ambassador had declared that even after the signature of the treaty, the Government would continue to show particular interest in three questions : (1) the nationalisation of the property of the late Shah, (2) a reduction in taxation, (3) the relaxation of administrative centralisation. This statement seems to have been an echo of a similar one which M, Smirnov made to the Prime Minister soon after the occupation : on that occasion he also suggested that fresh elections ought to be held—upon a broader and more representative basis. It is natural that the Soviet Government should favour the retention by the Persian State of the lands of the late Shah, as against the policy adopted of returning them to the^original, owners. The third proposition might be held by the Persians to justify their suspicion that the Soviet Government had encouraged a separatist movement in Azerbaijan. That there was much talk in Tabriz against the Central Government, after the occupation, is true, but it is equally true that the rich province of Azerbaijan had always been—like other provinces—squeezed and neglected, and that at the distant sound of the Russian approach almost all the important Persian officials fled to Tehran, abandoning their offices and their human charges with complete callousness. On the other hand, the Persian Government make a good case: the Russians would not allow Persian troops to go to Tabriz or Rezaieh; they disarmed the civil security forces and, when they allowed them to be rearmed, limited their number; individual commissars encouraged the use of Turki instead of Persian, and newspapers, films, plays and concerts in Turki were provided under Soviet auspices; and, finally, a number of Kurdish chiefs were invited—pressingly, in some cases—to pay a visit to Baku. This visit was subsequently described by M. Molotov to Sir R, Bullard, who saw him in Moscow when he went there to report to the Secretary of State, as purely cultural, but it might well have aroused suspicion in more trustful people than the Persians. 42. The Soviet Government profited by the occupation to increase very considerably their consular representation in Persia. In October or November they requested permission to establish consular posts at many places, including Tabriz, Meshed and Resht in the north, and Shiraz, Bandar Abbas, Isfahan, KermanShah, Ahwaz and Khorramshahr in the south. The position for the pre ceding few years had been that the Russians had one consul in Persia, at Enzeli, while the Persians had one in Russia, at Baku. The Persian Government, basing themselves on the principle of reciprocity in consular affairs, replied that consular posts at Tabriz and Meshed might be opened provided that the Persian Government was allowed to have consular posts at Tiflis and Ashkabad; and that, as for the other places, the matter would be examined. The Soviet Govern ment eventually said that they were prepared to agree in principle to the exten sion of Persian consular representation in Russia, but not during the war; and they appointed consular officers to Tabriz and Meshed, and then requested authorisation for consular posts in what they described as the “ second group ” of places, which included only two in the south, viz., Ahwaz and Kermanshah. The Persian Government had to give way. The Foreign Office, while, like the Government of India, apprehensive about the spread of Soviet influence in Persia, decided that since we already had about a dozen consular posts in Persia' when the Russians had had only one, it was for the Persians, not for us, to counter the Russian demands by an appeal to the principle of reciprocity. By the end of the year the Soviet Consulate at Kermanshah was being opened and a representative of the Soviet Trade Delegation had appeared at Ahwaz. 43. Anglo-Soviet relations were—all things considered—quite good. His Majesty’s Minister was fortunate in that, just at the beginning of the Russo- German war, the Soviet Ambassador in Tehran, a railway engineer who had never been known to make any but purely conventional remarks to any diplomaticmyp.'.if ,. jjitj 4^ 16 colleague, was replaced by an able and agreeable young man, M. Smirnov, who had spent several years in Berlin, first as assistant press attach^, and later as counsellor to the Soviet Embassy. In Meshed the Soviet military authorities showed the deepest suspicion of His Majesty’s Consul-General, to such an extent that an appeal for co-operation had to be made to the Soviet Government by^g^ Mr. Eden, though before the instructions from Moscow, which were eventually « sent, could reach Meshed, the attitude of the Soviet military authorities there had altered completely on the arrival from India of the first consignment of jute and shellac for Russia by the Zahidan route. General Novikov, who was in command of the Soviet troops in the west, though blandly evasive whenever his British comrades-in-arms asked for information, was personally full of friendli ness and hospitality. The Soviet troops, both officers and men, seem to have been astounded at the easy and friendly relations existing between the officers and men in the British and Indian forces; it was obvious that the opinions instilled into them by official Soviet propaganda was badly shaken. The Soviet authorities, however, found much in our official actions to feed their suspicions. It was unfortunate that the fact that the Russians are suspicious had apparently not been communicated to the British military and air authorities. Represen tatives of the air command would arrive, sometimes unannounced, with the statement that they were going to reconnoitre the aerodromes in the Soviet zone; a party of British journalists and photographers from Bagdad went to Azerbaijan without seeking the permission of the Soviet authorities; and, finally, three British officers with four lorries filled with Indian troops arrived at Tabriz from Bagdad, unannounced, to reconnoitre the roads in the Russian zone up to the Soviet frontier, and had to be ignominously withdrawn in the face of Russian objection. The argument of the British authorities responsible for these incidents seems to be that, since the object in every case was the promotion of the common cause, the Soviet authorities had no need to worry or object. The answer to this is that the Soviet authorities considered themselves capable of reconnoitring their own roads and aerodromes, and probably, not having been allowed by their Government to forget the “ intention ” of Great Britain and other Powers after the last war, regarded our curiosity on the subject as likely to be directed against the Soviet Union as much as against Germany. At one moment the Government of India became slightly alarmed at the advance of Russian troops to the south of Meshed and secured the acceptance by His Majesty’s Government of a proposal to send at least a token force to Zabul or possibly Birjand should it prove necessary, the Russians, however, withdrew so the project was not carried into effect. 44. About a month after the occupation the economic state of Persia seemed to be so unfavourably affected by local Soviet policy that His Majesty’s Minister suggested that a permanent commission should be set up in Tehran with British and Persian members to deal with all non-military questions arising out of the occupation. The Soviet Ambassador declared himself to be in favour of this scheme personally, but was obviously unwilling to take action. What was wanted, in Sir R. Bullard’s opinion, was a Soviet commissar with wide powers to undo the knots tied by Soviet stupidity and fear of responsibility. This proposal was supported bv His Majesty’s Government, but the Soviet Government preferred to leave such matters to the British and Soviet representatives in Tehran to deal with. It is possible that the Soviet Government feared to find themselves in a permanent minority in such a tripartite committee, and, indeed, great discretion would have been required on the part of the British representative. In point of fact, His Majesty’s Minister avoided all Persian attempts to drag His Majesty’s Government into Soviet-Persian disputes, though at times His Majesty’s Secretary of State had to bring arguments to bear upon M. Maisky in order to effect an improvement in the behaviour of the Russians in Persia. The British in Persia were doing their best to assist the Soviet effort by pushing through the largest possible quantity of goods. The United Kingdom Commercial Corporation, whose original business had been to buy up goods of which the enemy had urgent need, now set up a huge road-transport organisation for the carriage of goods to Russia. Skilled railway officials from India and elsewhere were despatched to Persia soon after the occupation : by the end of the year they had already effected great changes for the better in railway administration, and large numbers of workshops and operational personnel were on the way, and locomotives and wagons were beginning to arrive. An enormous scheme of road repair andimprovement was embarked upon, on routes by which goods could be carried to Russia. The quantity of goods carried in 1941, however, was not so great as to arouse any lively gratitude in the Soviet authorities. Indeed, they were inclined to gird at real or imaginary delays, and the Soviet railway commission was manoeuvring to try to obtain a larger, if not a preponderant, share in the ^management of the north-to-south railway. 45. In mid-October a secret message was received from the new Shah, saying that he would like to see His Majesty’s Minister fairly often, alone and without the knowledge of the politicians : he felt that some of his Ministers distorted the truth for their own ends, and mentioned various constitutional and administrative questions on which he would like Sir R. Bullard s advice. He wished, he said, to have the support of the British Lmpire and to work in close agreement with His Majesty’s Legation with the greatest discretion. His Majesty’s Minister replied that, while he would ask for instructions, he was sure that it would not be possible for him to be received without the knowledge of the Persian Cabinet and of the Soviet Ambassador. Ihe Shah then sent word that he realised the difficulty for a Minister, but hoped that the counsellor might see him—say twice a week. His Majesty’s Minister reported to the Foreign Office, saying that while he sympathised with the Shah’s wish to learn how best to serve his country, that object could not be attained by the attachment of the Shah to one Power exclusively. Sir R. Bullard foresaw obvious objections to frequent visits, whether secret or open : the Shah would tend to regard His Majesty’s Government more and more as a bulwark against Soviet Russia, and on the' other hand might be encouraged to feel that he understood public business and to intervene in the affairs of Government. Ihe Shah had vet to consolidate his position, though criticism was dying down, and should follow a non-political role. If he became publicly identified with His Majesty’s Government he would suffer for our real or alleged mistakes and we for his; our relations with the Persian Government would be embarrassed, and the Soviet Government would have ground for their so far baseless suspicions and might set dangerous forces in motion. Sir R. Bullard concluded by suggesting that the Shah should see all foreign representatives and all foreigners of distinction, so that if he happened to see the British rather more often than others, it would hardly be noticeable. This policy was approved by the Foreign Office. In fact the Shah did see His Majesty’s Minister and the counsellor, for one good reason or another, several times before the end of the year, besides o-iving to the military attache an audience at which he talked very frankly. He did not, unfortunately, adopt the practice of seeing the heads of other foreign missions and so missed an opportunity to get a more general conception of world affairs. Whenever he did see the head of a foreign mission he made a good impression. He showed perhaps disproportionate interest in the army, but this was natural in view of his own army service and of the importance which his father had attached to military affairs. In foreign politics he showed his wisdom, firstly in accepting whole-heartedly the necessity to work with the Allies, and secondly in maintaining that his Government were harming their own cause as well as that of their allies, by their failure to support it by active pro-Ally propaganda. 46. The Berlin broadcasts in Persian continued to exercise a great influence upon the classes of the population which have access to wireless receivers, and news items from v Axis sources continued to appear in the local press, though in a much smaller proportion than before the occupation. It was thought better to reduce the proportion gradually rather than to stop all Axis news in the press at once. The treaty, provided for the establishment of a complete tripartite censorship. The official application of this provision had to await the signature of the treaty in January 1942, but a complete scheme for the censorship was sanctioned, early in November, and although the Chief British Censor did not arrive until the 30th December, and then without any ‘ staff, a good beginning was made unofficially with the control of telegrams and the Persian Government even agreed, though with some reluctance, to abandon completely all wireless communication with Axis countries. With the assistance of a succession of volunteer helpers a censorship of outgoing press messages was set up, and if that did not work to the complete satisfaction of the foreign iournalists, this may be attributed partly to the fact that messages are bound to be delayed and often badly blue-pencilled which have to run the gauntlet18 of three separate censors, one of whom is Russian and another Persian. So much for the negative influences on public opinion, in the Allied interest. On the positive side efforts were beyig made which were to convert into a large Public Relations Bureau what had been the office of one overworked press attache. 47. At the end of 1941 Mr. Firoughi. who had been called in by Reza Sh a h immediately after the Allied invasion of Persia, was still in power. Ill-healtl\^v and a scholarly disinclination for the rough-and-tumble of political life would probably have led him to resign, but for a disinterested patriotism rare among Persians, which induced him to stay in power in order to carry the treaty through. Being naturally in favour of democratic institutions, and^ having been one of the principal opponents of the despotism set up by Reza khan, he considered himself bound to work with the Majlis and above all not to force them to pass the treaty or even to cut down the maximum period allowed by the Majlis for discussion. He was, however, completely disillusioned by the attitude of the deputies, who were in fact below even the Persian average. For years no free elections had taken place : the form was gone through, bpt the candidates were nominees of Reza Shah’s and were never opposed. Few of them would have been elected but for the Shah’s orders, and many were dishonest time-servers of a low type. All of them had served merely to countersign anything sent to them by the- Shah for 44 discussion, and it was revolting to see the passion for liberty which seized these former sycophants now that it could be indulged in without danger. Bills of great urgency, such as the Hoarding Bill and. the Bill for the Return of the late Shah’s Estates to the Original Owners, made very slow progress, mainly because of the personal interest of many of the deputies, and the attitude towards the treaty was timorous and pettifogging. It was too much to hope that men chosen by Reza Shah for their subversion would now show independence in face of the general attitude of the Persian public, which was pro-German rather than pro-Ally. The great Russian offensive which began in December, and especially the recoverv of Rostov by the Russians, together with the entry of the T mted States into the war, afforded something to daunt our enemies and hearten our friends, but the early successes of the Japanese were an influence on the other side, and it was not surprising that with the issue of the war still uncertain the unheroic Persians should do their best not to commit themselves.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS T)fm *NN Ic'-MjiNfY'S GOVERNMENT 4&gt; PERSIA. ^7* CONFIDENTIAL. mSRlO.

THE Anglo Soviet Persian Treaty of Alliance was signed on the 29th January, after a lengthy debate in the Majlis and endless attempts at procrastination and amendment by the Deputies and the Persian Government 2. For convenience of reference the following very brief summary ot tne treaty may be given here. Great Britain and the U.S.S.R. jointly and se\era iy undertook (article I) “to respect the territorial integrity, the sovereignty and the political independence of Persia,” and (article III (1)) “ to defend Persia by all means at their command from all aggression.” . . . Persia undertook (article 111 (2) (a)) to co-operate with the Allied Powers in every way possible in order that they may be able to fulfil this undertaking; and (by article III (2) (b)) to give tne Allies, for certain military purposes, the “ unrestricted right to use maintain, u-uard’and, in case of military necessity, control . . all the means of communi cation throughout Persia; to assist in obtaining material and recruiting labour, and to establish a censorship. . . 3. Article IV (1) stated that the Allied Powers could maintain on Persian territory land, sea and air forces, but it was specifically stated that iheir piesence did not constitute a military occupation, and would disturb as little as possible the administration and economic life of Persia. 4. Under article V. the Allied forces were to be withdrawn from 1 ersian territory not later than six months after all hostilities between the Allied Powers and Germany and her Associates had ceased. 5. Under article VII the Allied Powers undertook jointly to use their best endeavours to safeguard the economic existence of the Persian people against the privations and difficulties ” resulting from the war. 6. It is safe to say that both sides were disappointed with the carrying out of the treaty. The Persian Government showed no realisation of shipping and economic difficulties in the rest pf the world, and tried repeatedly to interpret article VII as binding the Allies to supply huge quantities of. lorries, motor tvres, spare parts, cereals and other commodities. The Alllies, on their part, had to complain that they met with very little co-operation from the Persian Government and authorities, who made practically no effort to meet the grave internal difficulties resulting from the war, and demanded the Allies’ assistance at every turn. On numerous occasions the Allies were unable to get even their most essential military requirements without the application of the strongest diplomatic pressure and. once or twice, a virtual threat of force. [25481]2 i ? — 7. Allied defeats in the South Pacific in the spring and in Africa in the summer contributed to this state of affairs, but it was all too obvious that pro crastination and obstruction, even to the most reasonable demands, are second nature to the Persian and are unlikely to be abolished by any treaty. » i A nqlo-Persian Relations. 8. As will be seen from subsequent paragraphs, the war forced HiC ^ Majesty’s Legation and the British Military Authorities to interest themselve V, closely in almost every sphere of Persian administration, owing to the necessity for developing and protecting Persia’s means of communication to bring supplies to Russia, and also owing to the compelling need for saving shipping space. No less than 4,000 miles of road were built, or repaired and maintained by British engineers all Over Persia; no fewer than twenty-nine modern aerodromes, many with cement runways, were constructed or were under construction; a large road transport organisation was built up by the United Kingdom Commercial Corpora tion, and a constant stream of modern lorries poured across the desolate passes of Persia carrying arms and supplies to Russia. The Trans-Iranian Railway was taken over by the Allies; North of Tehran it was under Russian, South of Tehran under British control. The tonnage carried on the railway was increased beyond recognition ; a new branch-line was built, connecting Khorramshahr and Ahwaz and to the port of Tanouma. The military authorities employed on roads and aerodromes alone about 70,000 Persian labourers and thus became one of the largest employers of labour in the whole country. The need for protecting these lines of communication led us into some queer fields; we were forced to take an interest in tribal policy to secure peace in districts adjoining vital roads and railways; we were obliged to interfere frequently and radically in the local administration which often showed itself incapable of facing w T ar problems; we w r ere obliged to ask for special security measures to be taken by the Persian Government to deal with suspects. 9. The compelling need to save shipping also forced us into a considerable degree of interference in local affairs. How this led us into largely controlling- road transport in Persia and into exercising a considerable influence on Persian agriculture, and how a Combined Supplies Committee was set up by which the foreign trade of Persia was virtually planned and controlled by English and American experts working under the Middle East Supply Centre in Cairo, will be seen from the following paragraphs. . 10. While our influence in Persia grew enormously as the year proceeded, it , cannot be said that our popularity grew with it. After the Allied defeats in the Far East and South Pacific, in Africa and in South Russia, during the spring and summer, it was natural that many Persians should hesitate to throw in their lot with us, or identify themselves with the Allied cause. The Allied victories in Africa and still more in Russia in the autumn largely convinced Persians, how ever, that the Allies would win the war. But there was another reason for our lack of success with the Persian public. The measures we had to urge on the Persian Government were not, for the most part, popular ones. The ruling classes of landowners and merchants found us opposed to their hoarding and speculation, and objected to the necessary measures of rationalisation and control, especially of transport and of food and other commodities, which were essential if Persia was to face the problems of the times successfully. The mass of the Persian people, who should have benefitted by these measures, either were too apathetic to care, or only blamed us for the gross corruption and inefficiency which characterised their application. For years it has been the practice to blame the British for all Persian troubles and shortcomings. We were blamed by the public for all Reza Shah’s extortions; for all the food and transport shortages. Did the British supply food to Tehran from the British zone even to the extent of some local shortages there? I hat was their fault. Did the Russians refuse to supply wheat to 4 ehran ? 1 he man in the bazaar merely whispered how much better conditions were in the Russian zone. 11. This attitude ol the Persian people presents a problem of which our extensive and many-sided propaganda, started all over Persia during the year by the Public Relations Bureau of this legation, has so far only been able to touch the fiange I doubt whether any economic concessions which it was in our power to make would have made any difference to it, and although we shall do our very best to undermine it, I fear we must expect it to persist and to colour Persian policy to some extent for years to come. Meanwhile, the corrupt upper class.while it still criticises us, will still come to us for protection against bolshevism, of which it lives in terror—and small wonder, seeing how ruthlessly it exploits the people. 12. Only a relatively short time has elapsed, however, since we and the Russians jointly invaded Persian territory. The problems which have since assailed Persia would have brought difficulties in any country, however well organised, and we cannot be surprised that they have dismayed the Persian people jJ^md affected Anglo-Persian relations adversely. There was a time when we used to wonder whether in the end we might not have to thke over the country and run it ourselves, superhuman as the task would have been. We have, however, succeeded in establishing a series of Persian Governments which have carried out the Treaty of Alliance for the most part, and have done most of what we had to ask, and at the end of the year Qawam-es-Sultaneh even made a clear declara tion of his Government's support for the Allied cause, thus giving a much-needed lead to the Persian people. In retrospect, I think that, in spite of our high hopes, we should have been lucky, in the conditions which obtain in this chaotic country, if we had got much more than we actually did get. Fundamentally, we have no demands to make on Persia, and our interest is to see Persia strong and indepen dent and friendly. This is the fundamental truth that we have, somehow, to make the Persian people believe. 13. Visits by a number of important British personalities during the year helped to impress the Persian Government and keep their spirits up during the difficult times of the summer. His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester visited Tehran in May. Mr. Winston Churchill, accompanied by many leading military and air personalities, passed through Tehran on his way to and from Moscow in August. Both visits were outstanding successes. Mr. R. G. Casey, Minister of State in Cairo, visited Tehran in October and was able to take stock of the most difficult and complicated food and financial problems in person. 14. Mr. R. C. Harris, British Vice-Consul at Isfahan, Dr. Griffiths and his son were murdered by tribesmen while on tour in the Dorud area on the 3rd August. We did not feel that the Persian Government could be held fully responsible, as the area was an unruly one where the Persian Government’s writ had never run, and we, therefore, did not present a claim for compensation. We, however, demanded the infliction of a fine on the tribe responsible, the appre hension of the murderers and the removal of Colonel Ferouhar and (subsequently) General Tajbakhsh, the Persian army officers most closely concerned, for their ineffectiveness in recovering the bodies and directing the enquiries. Colonel Ferouhar was suspected of worse than ineffectiveness and, indeed, there is some reason to believe that the murder was not entirely free from the influence of enemy agents. Tajbakhsh and Ferouhar were removed after much delay, but the Persian Government replied, as regards the apprehension of the murderers, that the whole tribe had disappeared into the mountains. Local enquiries were still in progress at the end of the year. . 15. British soldiers were brought to Tehran to ensure protection of British interests during the Tehran riots of the 7th and 8th December. Their arrival had an excellent effect. Unfortunately, three men were killed when the Persian army opened fire on a crowd in which their truck had broken down. At our request the Persian Government agreed to pay £500 compensation to the family of each of them. The Russian Embassy was informed in advance of the arrival of our troops, but no Russian troops were brought to Tehran. British Military Interests. 16. The tasks of the Commander-in-chief, Persia and Iraq area, may be summarised as being, firstly, to ensure the security of the oil installations in South Persia, and, secondly, to assist the carrying of supplies to Russia across Persia in every way possible. 17. The oilfields and refineries, particularly at Abadan, have a peculiar importance for the war both in Africa and in India, since it was the only large- scale source of oil supply within the reach of the Middle East. 18. Special security measures were taken at Abadan, and at the end of the year His Majesty’s Legation arranged for a special military governor to be appointed in Abadan Island, with powers to control persons entering and leaving the area. He was to be assisted by a British adviser. At the same time, the pay of the police, which is so low that they are usually quite unreliable, was to be supplemented by giving them food rations. Arrangements were also being made at the end of the year for fire-fighting training by British subjects to be made compulsory in the oil industry area. [25481] R 24 mm 19. There were no serious incidents with British troops in Persia, though a number of claims were made by the Persian Government for persons being run over by lorries, &amp;c. Much trouble occurred over the frontier and police control of lorries operating on behalf of the miltitary authorities, especially Persian lorries working under contract. In December, it was arranged that British detachments should be posted on the frontier on the main roads to prevent smuggling in such lorries, and the Persian Government g;ave instructions to the customs and police posts to refrain from stopping lorries which carried- certificate endorsed by the military check-posts to the effect that they were carry ing military goods. It is hoped that this arrangement will eliminate further difficulties. 20. Some difficulty was also caused by military purchases of commodities. The Persians had, for instance, for years past exported potatoes and the British military authorities were anxious to buy 10,000 tons. 1 he Persian Government, however, procrastinated about giving the necessary permits. Most of the quantity was bought by the military authorities and exported from Persia with out permits, the only alternative being to use shipping to bring potatoes from overseas. . 21. Much difficulty was also made over a request by the British military authorities to take over, as an urgent operational necessity, in view of the approach of the Germans to the Caucasus, certain telegraph lines between Tehran and Baghdad, and between Malayer and Andimeshk. The request, made in September, w 7 as based on article III (2) (b) of the I ripartite Treaty. In November the lines were taken over by the British military authorities for the operation of special apparatus, although the necessary permission had not been given. Only a mild protest was made by the Persian Government. 22. Some difficulty also arose with the Russian authorities over Caleb- murgheh aerodrome near Tehran. Although the R.A.F. had installed special direction-finding apparatus and were building an enormous runway there, the Russians established their troops at the aerodrome and made difficulties about the R.A.F. personnel using their apparatus. They made it clear that they intended to take it over entirely. After long negotiations, an agreement was come to on the 30th June between the R.A.F. and the Soviet authorities as regards the use of all the aerodromes in the Tehran area. It was agreed that the Soviet Air Force would have administrative control of the Calehmurgheh aerodrome and the Royal Air Force of the aerodromes at Doshan—Tappeh and Mehrabad. All aerodromes were to be used by both parties. No further difficulties arose about the R.A.F. using Calehmurgheh. 23. Special arrangements had to be made for the R.A.F. to take over Mehrabad aerodrome, which was the last aerodrome in the Tehran area in the full possession of the Persian Air Force. The R.A.F., who had specially close relations wdth the Persian Air Force, arranged special facilities to assist their transfer to Isfahan and Kerman. Mehrabad was taken over by the R.A.F. towards the end of the year. 24. We were somewhat concerned at the entire absence of A.R.P. m Persia. In spite of frequent representations by His Majesty’s Minister, nothing whatever wms done to provide even the most elementary A.R.P. system in Tehran, though in the oil area the oil company had its own A.R.P. system. The Persian Government took the view that an attack on Tehran was unlikely in spite of the military objectives which it contained, and that the population would be gravely frightened by any preparations that were made. They were encouraged in this view by the Russians, who were unwilling to admit that there was the smallest danger of the Germans being able to bomb Tehran. A German aeroplane dropped leaflets over Pahlevi in September and this, combined with the serious military situation m the Caucasus, induced the I ersian Government to make the initial preparations for establishing an A.R.P. system with the assistance of a P.A.D. Officer from G.H.Q., Paiforce, who visited Tehran several times in the autumn. At the end of the year arrangements were being made for Persian officers to train in A.R.P. in Egypt and requests by the Persian Govern ment for transport and equipment for A.R.P. purposes were under consideration. Relations with India. 25. Relations with India were uneventful throughout the year. The Nokkundi railway was extended to Zahidan and a supply route to Russia and China was opened via Meshed for goods brought from India. Trade between India and Persia was thus affected even on the land route by the over-riding need to send the maximum possible supplies to Russia.26. There was some correspondence with the Persian Government about communications with Bahrain, which is only mentioned as it showed that the Persian Government maintained their territorial claim to the island. 27. An incident occurred at Khorramshahr, on the 20th December, when the quarters of a number of Indian employees of the A.I.O.C. were looted by a Persian crowd. m^/typture of Relations with Japan and the April Crisis. 28. In spite of the signature of the treaty, the situation of the Allies in Persia continued to be most unsatisfactory in the early part of the year. Our requests on many important questions remained unmet and enemy propaganda continued to flourish up and down the country. Many of the difficulties which we experienced were traceable to the activities of the Japanese Legation, who were actively distributing enemy propaganda and also money among the Persians. Ihe rupture of relations between Persia and Japan accordingly became one of our primary objectives on wLich progress in every other sphere seemed to depend. The Anglo—Soviet-Persian 1 reaty could not be quoted in support of our representations to the Persian Government owing to the fact that' Japan was still in diplomatic relations with Russia. It w 7 as, however, urged upon the Persian Government that the closing of the Japanese Legation could reasonably be expected as an earnest of goodwill amongst Allies; that it would not harm Persian interests in Japan, or Japanese interests in Persia both of which, to all practical intents and purposes, were non-existent; that the continued presence of the Japanese Legation here could serve no useful purpose as all bag and cypher communication facilities had been denied them and that the Japanese Legation was, in fact, nothing more than a centre from which military intelligence reports were sent to the enemy (they w 7 ere known to have a secret wireless transmitter). 29. In spite of long and repeated representations, begun early in February, no progress could be achieved with this question for about two months. It was necessary to use every possible form of inducement and pressure. I he United States Government were persuaded to make the grant of lease-lend facilities for the Persian Government and the provision of expert advisers dependent on the rupture of relations with Japan. The Soviet Government agreed to inform the Persian Government that they had no objection to their breaking off relations with Japan. His Majesty’s Legation communicated to the Persian authorities evidence collected from secret and other sources to prove that the Japanese Legation were indulging in undiplomatic and subversive activities; finally, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Prime Minister and the Shah himself were warned in categorical terms that the situation would seriously deteriorate unless early satisfaction were given. . 30. Every conceivable prevarication was indulged in by the Persian Govern- jnent to keep the Japanese Legation, which they presumably regarded as their last policy of reinsurance with the Axis Powers. Che patience of His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom was eventually exhausted. In the middle of April the Soviet Government was informed that we had decided to concentrate troops outside Tehran and to occupy the capital if necessary and enfoice the closing of the Japanese Legation. n i 1 31. It was arranged that Sir Reader Bullard would then demand an immediate audience with the Shah and insist on the rupture of relations with Japan. The Soviet Ambassador was told that, if British forces were eventually obliged to occupy Tehran, and if the situation should so develop as to render other measures necessary, the Soviet Government might wish to be associated in the occupation of the capital. Flis Majesty’s Government would welcome such a decision. The Persian Government, however, sensing, no doubt, that His Majesty’s Government had made up their minds to take forceful action, finally o-ave up the unequal struggle, and on the 12th April instructed the Japanese Minister to leave Persia with his staff in one week. Eventually the Legation left Tehran on the 23rd April. . t , 32. Meanwhile, there existed other acute causes for dissatisfaction with the Persian Government (a) It was proving increasingly difficult to obtain sufficient rial currency in exchange for sterling to finance the expenditure of the British military authorities on road, rail and aerodrome developments in Persia. The statutory limit of the note issue had been reached, and the Persian Government were unwilling or unable to persuade the Majlis to increase it. Yet clearly the work of developing communications with Russia had to proceed; {h) no effective measures had been taken by the Persian Government to stop Axis propaganda(5 or even to make it illegal; (c) for weeks His Majesty’s Legation had been demanding, without success, the internment of the six most notorious Persian pro-Axis propagandists. It appeared to His Majesty’s Minister desirable to clear the air by insisting at once that all these eminently reasonable desiderata should be met and should be included in representations to the Shah, backed by the threat of force, and that, if possible, similar action should be taken by the Russians. It was decided that His Majesty's Minister should seek the audience with the Shah, but that, if satisfaction had been obtained over the departure/f^- the Japanese Legation by then, less drastic representations should be made. 33. The audience eventually took place on the 22nd April. It was apparent that the movement of Russian and British troops which had taken place and the warnings which had previously been delivered had been reported to His Majesty, who was evidently aware of the possibility of strongest action by His Majesty s Government. The. Shah expressed the keenest desire for the settlement of the currency question (the subsequent negotiations led eventually to the signature of the Anglo-Persian Financial Agreement on the 26th May, which met our needs fully so far as the purchase of rials was concerned). Further, as the result of repeated and insistent representations, a proclamation, making enemy propaganda illegal, had been issued and published in the press that very morning. Similarly, satisfaction had also been given the same day over the arrest of most of the six Axis supporters; it was, therefore, unnecessary for His Majesty’s Minister to utter any direct threat 33a! This crisis cleared the air, and for some weeks we secured many of our desiderata without great difficulty, though we continued to have much trouble over Axis supporters and sympathisers. Security questions. 34. Throughout the year the question of the rounding up of Persian Fifth-Columnists and Germans in view of their potential danger to British interests and security has been regarded by the legation as one of supreme importance. After consultation with the Foreign Office, a list of seven prominent and active Persian pro-Axis supporters against whom sufficient .evidence was forthcoming was submitted, at the end of February, to the Persian Government with the request that these suspects should be detained under Persian police supervision in Eastern Persia. In spite of the necessary assurances from the Persian Government, it was soon learned that three of the suspects were still at large. In view of this clear demonstration of bad faith, His Majesty’s Legation demanded the immediate arrest of six of the suspects and their delivery to the British military authorities for safe keeping. As the seventh suspect, Atabai, was a brother-in-law of the Shah, it was thought desirable that he should simply be detained in Eastern Persia under police supervision. After considerable hesitation, five of the suspects were handed over at the end of April for detention at Kermanshah, the sixth, Vaziri by name, escaped from Persian police supervision and, despite constant representations, was still at large at the end of the year. It was not until the middle of July, when a fresh recrudescence of Axis activity broke out, that a further list of eighteen suspects was handed to the Prime Minister with a request for their arrest and delivery to the British military authorities. The Prime Minister handed over a small number of Germans and Persian suspects already in the hands of the Persian police and agreed that he would deliver to His Majesty’s Legation eleven of the eighteen suspects, but M. Soheily fell from office before action could be taken. 35. In view of the difficulties of the past, it was decided, when Qawam-es- Sultaneh became Prime Minister, to try to establish an agreed procedure to obviate our having to haggle for each suspect or group of suspects. Accordingly, a new list of forty-five names was drawn up, consisting entirely of names of persons implicated in the evidence given by Germans or Persians already in British custody. It was communicated to the Prime Minister, who was prompt to secure the arrest of nearly all the persons on the list, but held out for the detention of the Persian nationals at Tehran. After the failure of an appeal by the Prime Minister direct to London, an agreement was finally worked out whereby suspects should be detained at Sultanabad and not sent to Ahwaz or elsewhere and the Persian authorities should participate both in the interrogation and in the supervision of the suspects. In practice this procedure has worked out extremely well, in spite of the difficulties with which we were faced throughout the negotiations owing to the lack of support from the United States and Soviet representatives.7 36. In the interests of security, proposals were submitted in November to the Foreign Office by His Majesty’s Legation in agreement with General Wilson for the arrest of General Zahidi, Colonel Ferouhar, M. Nobakht and General Kupal on general grounds of persistent and dangerous hostility to the Allied cause. In view of their importance it was clear that it would be futile to request the Persian authorities to effect their arrest, and it was, therefore, suggested that the British military authorities should take the necessary measures ' i Nmselves. It was finally agreed by all concerned that we should concentrate fi Jt on General Zahidi, as being the most dangerous of the four persons concerned, and defer action against the others, in order to see first the effect produced by the arrest of General Zahidi. All necessary measures were accordingly taken by the British military and General Zahidi was arrested without the use of force in his house at Isfahan on the 6th December and immediately removed from the country. As the arrest coincided with the riots at Tehran, it passed almost unnoticed. Both the Shah and the Prime Minister mentioned the matter to His Majesty’s Minister and seemed rather aggrieved that they had not been warned of our intentions in advance.. The Shah expressed the view that, if he had been told, he would at once have had General Zahidi arrested. They were both informed in reply that any previous notification would have been very awkward for the Persian Government and that it was accordingly thought better that the British military authorities.should take full responsibility. As regards the other three suspects, no decision had been taken before the end of the year. The Supply of Foodstuffs. 37. Since the upheaval of August 1941 no effort had been made to collect any appreciable amount of the Government share of the 1941 wheat crop, which was required for the feeding of the towns, and early in the year it became apparent that the equitable distribution of the wheat available in the country and of that imported from abroad was beyond the power of the Persian Govern ment. Consular officers were therefore directed to include the supervision of wheat distribution in so far as it might be possible within the scope of their activities; but by April it was realised that if further imports were to be avoided far more drastic intervention on our part would be required. The Government were urged both verbally and in writing to take timely steps to secure their full share of the coming harvest by all means in their power, including raising the price from the previous low level of £8 a ton, and announcing the new price in good time. They were clearly informed that until this had been done they could expect no help in the way of shipments of wheat from abroad. The advice fell on deaf ears, and it was not until July, when the harvest in the south was already gathered, that as a result of continued pressure from the legation, an average price of 1,500 rials (about £12) a ton was at last announced. By this time the black market price had already risen considerably beyond this figure and the concession was too late. 38. In order further to stimulate the Persian Government to activity, especially in the provinces, where their authority was weak, the consular liaison officers’ scheme was introduced by which British officers, borrowed mainly in the first instance from the army and subsequently from Burma, were posted to the principal districts, not only to ascertain the real extent of the surplus on which the Government should be required to lay its hand, but also to do what they could to keep the local officials up to their work. The scheme met with varying success in the different provinces. In Khuzistan it was a complete failure and had to be abandoned owing to the refusal of the Government even to try and cope with the situation, and in Kermanshah it has met with little success; but in other areas it has been of real use, stimulating the lazy and encouraging the timorous to do their duty. 39. Numerous representations by His Majesty's Minister led to the passing of two anti-hoarding laws during the spring and summer, the second of whicli virtually gave the Government full powers to deal with hoarders. But by no amount* of representations did we ever succeed in getting effective action taken against hoarders. The Government was unwilling either to force landowners to sell at the official price or to pay them the price they demanded. Nor was any effective action taken by the Persian Government to prevent smuggling into Iraq. Regardless of the difficult shipping situation, they requested the sending of large supplies of cereals and made representations both in London and in Washington on the subject.8 qnw 40. Successive changes in government made the observance and enforcement of any settled food policy an impossibility, and little progress was made in this direction until the arrival of Mr. Sheridan, the American adviser to the Ministry of Food, at the end of September. Faced with an almost impossible task, and handicapped by an erratic and obstinate Minister, and his own ignorance of the country and having no senior member of his staff with any knowledge whatsoever of the problem with which he had to deal, Mr. Sheridan set to work undaunted, hut with perhaps more energy than discretion. He more than doubled the offic#r price offered for wheat without taking any steps to provide the funds or f .e administrative machinery for payment of the new price; transferred and dismissed officials right and left, only to find that the new men on whom he relied were little improvement on the old. and embarked on all sorts of experiments, few of which were carried through. The result was continued chaos and, though by feverish efforts at the last minute, the capital was kept supplied with bread, Mr. Sheridan never succeeded in securing more than three or four days' reserve in the silo. 41. Extensive demands made on the Persian Government by the Russians for food-stuffs, including 5,000 tons of wheat, 15,000 tons of barley and 30,000 tons of rice, did not help matters, and in the late autumn the prospect became so bad * that His Majesty’s Government and the United States Government together had to promise to import into Persia, as soon as possible, 25,000 tons of wheat to replace what the Russians were purchasing. The greatest difficulty was caused by the fact that the Russians were apparently not prepared to aliow wheat to be sent to the capital from Azerbaijan and Khorassan, which were the obvious sources of supply, though the Soviet Ambassador in London stated that his Government had given permission for 35,000 tons of wheat to be sent. This made it difficult or impossible to plan Tehran’s wheat supply in advance, and furnished the Persian authorities with an admirable excuse for their inactivity elsewhere. 42. Anxiety over the food situation was the predominant feeling in Tehran throughout the autumn, and the problem of the supply of cereals became an important factor in the negotiations regarding the supply of rials and other questions affecting Allied interests. The discussions on cereals culminated in the Food Agreement, signed in Tehran by His Majesty’s Minister, the United States Minister and the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 4th December, 1942. By this agreement the United Kingdom and the United States Government undertook to ensure, within the full limit of their powers, that supplies of cereals were brought to Persia to make up any unavoidable deficiency up to the harvest of 1943, provided that the Persian Government carried out all the measures recommended by the American food adviser, Mr. Sheridan, including measures to prevent hoarding and the introduction of rationing, as well as the recommendations of the Road Transport Committee. It was at the same time provided that the Persian Government were responsible for the internal distribution of cereals and for ensuring that a deficiency in one area was met by a surplus from another. The United States and the British Governments undertook, so far as possible, to ensure that the means of transport at the disposal of the Persian Government were sufficient, if put to the best possible use, for the proper distribution of these cereals. 43. The Soviet Government were invited to participate in the Food Agreement, but replied that, in view of their own food difficulties, they did not propose to do so. 44. Lnfortunately, delivery of even the first consignment of the promised 25,000 tons of wheat had to wait in shipments from North American ports and. when the bread supply of Tehran failed completely in the first week of December, the situation was only saved by advancing flour from British army stocks. Altogether 1,500 tons of flour were made available to the Persian Government in this way and further supplies of cereals were forthcoming in the form of 3,500 tons of Iraqi barley. 45. In order to increase the production of wheat and barley in Khuzistan, one of the main deficit areas, and to ensure a measure of long-term improvement in the general food situation, negotiations were set on foot in the course of the summer to acquire for His Majesty’s Government or for a British organisation under Allied auspices the lease of certain Persian State farms at Hamidieh and Ahudasht, to the north-west of Ahwaz, which, although fertile, were then exploited to little or no purpose by an organisation known as the Khuzistan Agricultural Society. These negotiations failed, but the Persian Government did consent to the society being managed by a British director. The services of Lieut.-Colonel E. W. C. Noel were obtained from India; he was given a free9 [25481] c hand to run*these farms, subject only to the financial control of the Domains Department of the Persian Ministry of Finance. Five hundred tons of wheat seed were imported from India on loan from the British army and the first yeai s crop is expected to amount to some 3,500 tons. For the second year it is hoped to sow some 2,000 tons and the project should eventually provide a considerable proportion of the wheat requirements of Khuzistan. 46. Meanwhile, everything possible is bein^ done to increase the area sown 1943. It has been agreed with the Persian Ministry of Agriculture that local committees shall be set up with the co-operation of local British and Persian Government officials and the* principal landowners to investigate every possibility of coping with these and other problems. A systematic study, by regions, will be made of seed requirements in order to arrange, if necessary, for imports of seen in good time for the spring sowing. . . 47. In retrospect it may be said that while we were disappointed at the ineffectiveness of the Persian Government in facing tneir food problem, oui efforts were not entirely wasted. We shall have imported for the year 1942-43 only about half what we had to import for the year 1941-42 and of the half, 20,000 is to replace the 5,000 tons of wheat and 15,000 tons of barley which the Persian Government undertook to supply to the Soviet authorities. This result is attributable to the unremitting efforts of Mr. Sheridan, of this legation and oi the consular liaison officers. Commercial and Economic Questions. 48. Persia was profoundly affected by the limitation of sea-boi ne impoi ts owing to the war and, at the same time we were anxious to ensure that proper use was made of local supplies and resources so as to save shipping space and also to reserve the northward lift on the roads and on the 1 rans-Iranian Railway for supplies going to Russia. . , 49 In March, Persia was included among the countries covered by the activities of the Middle East Supply Centre, and a Combined Supplies Committee was set up in Tehran, comprising British and American representatives, to deal with all problems relating to civil supplies. At the request of this committee, the Persian Government introduced an import licensing system in July, as a result of which imports became gradually confined only to essential goods. About 26,000 tons of goods were licensed for import from the beginning of this control until the end of the year. Shipping recommendations and information relating to essential imports are sent to the Middle East Supply Centre in Cairo so that Persia’s current and future needs may be co-ordinated with Middle East Supply Centre planning for all the countries of the Middle East under its control. During this period, also, investigations were carried out under the supervision of the Combined Supplies Committee into means of saving shipping by the development of Persian industries and natural resources in order to supply as much of Persia’s needs as possible at home. For this reason and to make available supplies of material in world short supply, the local production of the following has been increased : copper, lead, chromium, antimony, sulphur, borax sodium compounds, refractory materials, manganese ore, alum and coal. 49a. The Combined Supplies Committee is now the supervising committee of a number of sub-committees specialising in specific problems or commodity groups. At the end of the year the latter comprised an Agricultural Advisory Committee, an Import Control Committee, a Mining and Chemical Development Committee and a Medical Advisory Committee. All these are co-operating actively with the Persian authorities concerned and reporting and making recommendations to the Combined Supplies Committee. 50. Transport questions provided much material for controversy throughout the year. Reza Shah having largely succeeded in abolishing the camel, Persia is dependent on motor transport for the distribution of numerous commodities, especially food-stuffs, on which the economic existence of the country depends. ■Imports of lorries and tyres were, however, drastically cut down in view of Allied war needs and, in addition, the D^nited Kingdom Commercial Corporation and the Russian Transport organisation contracted a considerable number of Persian lorries to carry supplies to Russia. Unfortunately, the Persian Govern ment were reluctant to take effective steps to rationalise their road transport system. During the summer the U.K.C.C. endeavoured to effect a certain rationalisation of it, but the Persian Government enlisted American sympathy by complaining of attempts at a monopoly. Eventually much combined Allied pressure was exerted : it ended in the formation of a Road Transport Board,10 with Persian, British, American and Russian participation, which has been working for the last two months. It has instituted a control of road transport, particularly of lorry transport It controls the activities of the Persian Govern ment Road Transport Department (the head of which is Mr. C. Birkle, formerly head of the Transport Department of the U.K.C.C. in Persia). The department, which is a section of the Ministry of Supply, had built up, by the end. of the year, a fleet of contracted vehicles which were being used for the transport of wheat, oil, rice and other commodities essential to the civil life of the countrr*^* The resources at the disposal of the Board and the Persian Government are, however, greatly below their minimum requirements; even the carriage of food-stuffs leaves much to be desired, and other urgent needs, such as transport for the campaign against locusts, for the Khuzistan wheat cultivation scheme, &amp;c., are in danger of being starved. 51. The Persian Government demanded the importation of large quantities of motor transport during the year, and in the autumn it was agreed to supply them with fifty lorries a month out of civil allocations to the Middle East. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the United States Govern ment accepted a limited obligation to supply essential quantities of motor transport to Persia under the Food Agreement signed on the 4th December in Tehran (see in this connexion the section on the supply of food-stuffs). 52. Timber supplies for the British army, including railway sleepers, which come mainly from the Russian-occupied zone, have been obtained only with great difficulty, owing to the mass of formalities with which the Persian Government surrounded the issue of permits and the execution of their forestry regulations and to the constant squeezing of the contractors working for the British army by local racketeers. Strong action has had to be taken to obtain co-operation from the Persian Government, and the situation has not been made easier by the refusal of the Russians to lend assistance. The position is still by no means satisfactory. 53. The efforts of this legation and other British organisations to increase economic activity in Persia have been consistently retarded and obstructed by the lack of energy and co-operation of the Persians, particularly of Government servants. Before the recent Allied victories this was due to a great extent to pro- Axis sympathies; but after these successes the normal inertia of the people of this country has become the chief obstacle to progress. This can be countered effectively only by introducing more and more Allied advisers and experts of different kinds. 54. Financial questions caused much anxiety throughout the year. A full report on our financial relations with Persia during the year 1942 was sent to you under cover of my despatch No. 91, dated the 9th March, 1943, and no detailed account is therefore given of them here. 55. The handling of the food supply problems and of economic and financial problems generally was rendered much more difficult by the chaotic parliamentary and governmental system with its division of responsibility and kaleidoscopic changes. Internal Political Situation. 56. The 13th Majlis continued to sit throughout the year without being dissolved, in spite of the questionable basis of the 1941 elections, in which all the candidates were merely the nominees of Reza Shah. Apart from that fundamental flaw, the Majlis, on several occasions throughout the year, showed little desire either to let the Government carry out reasonable reforms, such as the anti hoarding measures, or to co-operate with the Allies. However, the desire of most of the foreign legations, of the Shah and of the Prime Minister to see the obstructive assembly dissolved never came to fruition; at the last moment of a crisis it was always found either that the Russians would not quite commit themselves, or that the Prime Minister could not summon up enough courage to take the decisive step of announcing a dissolution, or that the Majlis passed the measure in question and then lay back and patted themselves on the back for that proof of loyalty and friendliness to the Allies. 57. Before summarising the principal events of the year in the political sphere, two general tendencies may be recorded. The first was a tendency to refer all matters of delicacy and importance to secret sessions of the Majlis, ostensibly in order to test the feeling of the Majlis in the matter, or to enable the Government to put their point of view before the Majlis Deputies in circum stances which gave more latitude for frank expressions of opinion than in public sessions. This tendency was first noticed in Foroughi’s Cabinet; a secret session11 [25481] c 2 on the 3rd March was the beginning of the downfall of that Cabinet and the rise of Soheily. Similarly, such important questions as the Currency Bills and the expulsion of the Japanese Legation were first debated in secret sessions. 1 ^e ac that announcements in the press revealed most of the proceedings of these sec ‘ 1 ^ sessions did not prevent Prime Ministers from frequently resorting to e expedient; in fact, Soheily hoped, in vain, that by that means he could ben e Majlis to his will on all controversial matters. K ' 58. The second general tendency is the increase m the personal power ot the ohah. Guided by self-seeking courtiers secure from public criticism, the young Shah, throughout the year, gradually but steadily took a more direct interest m current affairs. Not only did he assume the powers and authority of an executne head of the army, but he cultivated relations with certain Deputies of the Majlis, subsidised certain newspapers, and did his best to secure the resignation o Qawam-es-Saltaneh during the critical times of the riots J^he o au 9th December, 1942, in spite of the direct advice to the contrary ot His Majesty s Minister. He criticised the conduct of the highly respected Foroughi as Minister of Court, and was thought to have brought about the fall of Soheily s Cabinet m July by refusing the support of the army in the event of popular disorders, it was perhaps inevitable that at times when the Government of the eountrs was m a state of chaos the Shah should wish to influence it, but his interventions were not always wdse, and it gave rise to fears that he might c h ei ^ s 1 a so 11 1S ambitions like his father. ^The Shah’s attitude to the Allies was, however, most friendly throughout the year, and there were indications that he would ha\e liked Persia to enter the war on the Allied side. , ,, -i- 59. It will be convenient to describe the Cabinet changes and the Majlis developments under three heads :— (1) Foroughi’s Cabinet, which fell in March; (2) Soheily’s, which lasted till July; and . (3) Qawam-es-Saltaneh’s, which began in August and was still in power at the end of the year. 00 (1) The most important business of Foroughi s Cabinet was the passing of the Tripartite Treaty. The first reading passed the Majlis early m January and the second reading, after a great deal of argument on the 26th January, and signature took place three days later. Other matteis dealt with by the Majlis were : A Bill authorising the payment of increased pensions to the dependants of Persian soldiers killed in the lighting of the previous August • a Bill preventing hoarding and profiteering: a Bill regulating the disposal of the lands of the ex-Shah. Early in February, however, criticisms of the Cabinet began to appear in the press and in the Majlis, partly owing to dissatisfaction with the Government’s methods of dealing with economic and administrative problems, and partly owing to intrigues on behalf of rival candi dates for ministerial rank. The four possible candidates for the post ox Prime Minister were Taqizadeh, Tadayyun, Qawam-es-Saltaneh (Ahmed Qawam), and Seyyid Zia. Apart from that,‘the Minister of the Interior, Marshal Amir Alimedi, came in for most of the criticism. Finally, all the members of the Cabinet placed their resignations in the hands of the Prime Minister on the 26th February, and on the 2nd March Foroughi presented a new team of Ministers, which lasted only a few hours; it included Soheily as Minister foi Foreign Affairs, Kazemi at the Interior, and Hajhir at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. There followed a period of crisis and intrigue : the Deputies seemed determined to block all Foroughi’s appointments without making any constructive suggestions of their own. In an effort to placate them, the weary Prime Minister tried the novel expedient of selecting fourteen Deputies by' lot to advise him as to the formation of his Cabinet: that came to nothing, and he resigned. Qawam appears to have been sent for by the Shah, but His Majesty finally called on Soheily, who by a series of manipulations secured an almost unanimous vote of confidence in a secret session of the Majlis, and announced his Cabinet in a public session on the 9th March. 01.—(2) Soheily’s Cabinet consisted of himself as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister of the Interior, Jehanbani as Minister of War, Mahmoud Bader as Minister of Finance, Mustafa Adi as Minister of Education, Azudi as Minister of Communications, Ahy as Minister of Justice, Hikmat as Minister of Health, Hajhir as Minister of Commerce and Industry, Ahmed Hussain Adi as Minister of Agriculture, and Fazlollah Bahramy as Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. The new Prime Minister’s programme was a satisfactory catalogue1 &lt; J- wn 12 of good intentions : observance of existing treaties was one of the first points^ laws were to be revised : the army strengthened : the budget balanced, and food supplies secured. The Prime Minister’s remarks about the serious food situation had one unfortunate effect—a number of persons of the upper classes took precautions to lay in a considerable stock of flour and other food-stuffs against the coming scarcity; a course of action which sent prices up further still amd made the Government’s task in the following spring more difficult. The Majlis passed a Bill against hoarding on the 18th March, and regulations arising therefroi^ were published in May. Three major issues then came into prominence: the^ closing of the Japanese Legation, the arrest of certain Axis agents whose activities we had discovered, and currency questions, especially the supply of notes sufficient to tide over the increased demand caused by inflated prices and the Allies’ war expenditure. The device of a secret session was used to square the Majlis about the Japanese, vague promises were given us about the Axis agents, and the currency question was temporarily solved by the issue of 700 million new notes. The Government then attempted to solve the food problem by obtaining full powers to deal with problems of food distribution, by acquiring and distri buting food themselves. A Bill amending the existing conscription law was brought before the Majlis, but was eventually returned by the Majlis for revision. Muhammed Sa’ed Maraghai returned from Russia to be Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 23rd June, and, to the surprise of most observers, Mehd.i Farrukh was appointed Minister of the Interior on the 2nd July. Opposition to Soheily was by this time growing apace : Tadayyun and Qawam-es-Sultaneh were very active in opposition, ugly stories of the Prime Minister’s venality and nepotism were circulating, and the Adalat party, led by Dashti and Farajollah Bahramy, did their best to unseat Soheily and replace him by Qawam-es-Saltaneh. Serious discussions were at this time taking place between His Majesty’s Minister and the Soviet about the advisability of dissolving the Majlis altogether, but the Soviet Ambassador finally expressed the opinion that the moment was not opportune. The Soheily Government finally resigned on the 30th July, and three days later the Majlis voted for Qawam-es-Saltaneh. 62. (3) Qawam-es-Saltaneh started well by taking a firm line with the press : he appeared to have more authority and courage - than either of his two immediate predecessors : and he was evidently anxious to work with the Allies and remain in office. His programme was short: he stood for the observance of treaties, for internal security, and for ensuring the supply of food and medicines for the whole nation. His Cabinet contained two elder statesmen without portfolio in an advisory capacity, Hakim-ul-Mulk and Mustashar-ed- Douleh : Sa’ed remained at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Azudi and Haihir at their respective posts. Finance was left vacant, pending an answer from Taqi- Zadeh, in London : Kasemi had the Ministry of the Interior till the 22nd August, when he took over the Ministry of Finance, Javad' Ameri becoming Minister of the Interior. Dr. Siassi was Minister of Education: Hamid Sayyah, Minister of Posts and Telegraphs; Baha-ul-Mulk Minister of Justice; Dr Aram-ul-Mulk Minister of Health; and Adi remained at the Ministry of Agriculture. Ihe new Prime Minister himself took over the difficult postofMmister of War, thereby involving himself in a dispute with the Chief of the General Staff and with the Shah himself, which developed into a struc'o'le for control of the Ministry and finally led to Qawam’s downfall The new Prime Minister showed a helpful and firm attitude in the question of the handing over of certain suspects whom he had reason to believe were supporters of the Axis and he finally talked the Majlis into having them transferred to Sultanabad for detailed interrogation by a mixed body of investigators. A Bill increasim* still further the note issue, was passed on the 12th September, just avoiding in the nick of time, a. majoi financial crisis. 1 hese issues were, however only settled to our moderate satisfaction after the Prime Minister had been squarely informed that we should judge the sincerity of his Government by the way in which it dealt with these questions, and after a direct warning also to the Shah. Subsequently a declaration of support for the Allies was made. Inspectors were appointed in order to remedy and prevent abuses and irregularities by Government officials and broadcasts by Qawam about the Government's resolve'to govern energetically in co-operation with the Allies were well received. At the end of September Qawam appointed Farrukh as Minister of Food ; an unfortunate appointment as the new Minister was scatter-brained and temperamental. Majlis opposition obliged the Prime Minister to withdraw the Conscription Bill for further study and the resignation of the Chief of the General Staff, Morteza Yazdan Panah’ although not accepted, was a further mark of the growing dissatisfaction”withwhich Qawam had to contend. It must be confessed that certain appointments made by Qawam were most unwise and exposed him to accusations of favouritism and nepotism; Kazemi soon resigned, after behaving most disloyally to his chief; soaring prices exacerbated popular discontent, and the latent fear of the Deputies that the Prime Minister might dissolve v the Majlis altogether inclined them to oppose the Government in various ways. In November the Prime Minister, not without justification, came to the conclusion that it would be impropriate to ask the Majlis to give him full powers to cope with the very .fficult situation. This proposal evoked the most violent opposition from the Majlis, who seemed to see in it a scheme to make Qawam an uncontrolled dictator who would be able to dissolve the Majlis and manage the next election as it best suited him. At a stormy secret session on the 19th November the Majlis showed determined and violent opposition to the Prime Minister, although they declared themselves in favour of the Allies and ready to provide them with whatever currency they needed. The dispute between Qawam and the Shah was brought to a climax by an outbreak of looting and rioting in the streets of Tehran on the 8th and 9th December; the Shah behaved unwisely, and did his best to order the Prime Minister to resign, in spite of having agreed with His Majesty’s Minister that he was to stay in office. The firm stand taken by Qawam during this crisis created a very good impression on this legation, but it was not long before Qawam s efforts to please the Deputies caused him new difficulties, and at the end of the year the harassed head of the Government was endeavouring to find new members for his Cabinet who might be acceptable both to the Shah and the Deputies. 63. Generally speaking, the successive Persian Governments showed them selves weak, vacillating, corrupt and quite unable to cope unaided with the difficult tasks of the times. It was impossible to get them to consider any serious measures to protect the people against war-time hardship or against the exploitation by the landlords and merchants. Taking a long view it seems almost impossible that the present state of affairs can continue indefinitely, and many people, including the Shah, according to some indications, consider that a more radical type of Government will have to be found if revolutionary tendencies are to be avoided. But the people of Persia are ill-informed, politically unconscious and appear to be almost infinitely long-suffering. Persian Army. 64. During the year the Persian forces have not contributed greatly to the welfare or stability of the country. Although there has been no serious interfer ence with the lines of communication used by the Allies, there has been a progressive weakening of the authority of the Central Government in the pro vinces and particularly in tribal areas, due. in part, to its own lack of policy, but also to the unwillingness of Persian commanders to risk a conflict with the rearmed tribes and to a newly-discovered conscientious objection to fratricidal warfare. None of the several Governments that have attempted to hold power succeeded in establishing more than a semblance of control over the army, reluctant to abandon its freedom from ministerial control, or to admit that it should become the servant of the country whose master it had been for so long. In this attitude it has been supported by the Shah, who, doubtful of the popular enthusiasm for the dynasty, has jealously resented any limitation of the personal control of the army which he claims is his prerogative by virtue of his constitutional position as commander-in- chief. It is clearly his desire that the army should look to him rather than to the Government, and Ke is more concerned that it should be attached to his person than that it should enforce the Government’s authority. 65. Although popular hostility has moderated as a result of greater discretion shown by senior officers in their methods of acquisition and a less obvious arrogance on the part of junior officers, the army remains unpopular with the general public and appears to them to give a poor return for its heavy cost. Some, though little, progress was made in the elimination of corruption, but corruption must remain endemic until officers are paid a living wage. There was little improvement in morale. Pro-German sentiments and the intrigues of German agents and sympathisers produced a feeling of uncertainty and mutual distrust and a reluctance to display any cordial desire to co-operate in furthering the interests of the Allies. Allied successes in Russia and Africa have consider ably reduced the influence of pro-German elements; respect for the Allies is orowing, but the army remains without ideal and without inspiring purpose. The ideal of reforming itself and of restoring law and order in the country does not yet make sufficient appeal.14 66. A reorganisation to suit its limited role of maintaining interna security was initiated in February. The full scheme allowed for eight divisions (seven of three brigades and one of two brigades) amd an independent brigade at Isfahan. Each brigade was to consist of one regiment of infantry, one squad ron of cavalry, and three batteries of artillery. The total paper strength ot tiis reorganised army was 86,000, but its actual strength has been considerably ess than this figure. The organisation is not yet complete, partly owing to norma Persian inefficiency and partly to the reluctance of the Russians to allow 1 ersi^i** troops in the areas occupied by Soviet troops. _ . 67. A new scheme has now been prepared by General Ridley of the united States army, who arrived in Tehran in October, nominally as adviser to the Intendent-General’s Department of the Persian War Office, but he is m fact the adviser to the Ministry of War without official position. He proposes ten divisions totalling 53,000 fighting men. Recruits, staffs, services and training establishments bring this total to 86.000. His proposals do not greath anect the organisation of combatant units except that he recommends the temporary dis bandment of nearly all of the field artillery. He is more concerned with improving the system of recruit training, the organisation of communication, transport, supply and medical units which do not now exist, and the increase of pay and allowances to officers to an extent that will make honesty at least possible. An increase of nearly 100 per cent, in the army budget will be required to pay for this unprecedented condition. . r , , 68. Motor transport is essential to the successful operation ot General Ridley’s scheme. The almost complete lack of transport has served as a ready excuse for the inactivity of the Persian -forces during the past year. Two hundred lorries are understood to have been despatched from America at the request of General Ridley. He is optimistic that, given suitable equipment, the Persian army can, with American guidance, be transformed into a force capable of being of value to the Allies, at least in the preservation of order and protection of the lines of communication. This must depend on there being an adequate number of American officers and on their being given some degree of authority. For this there is both opposition and support within the army. The Shah wavers between the hope that American advisers might produce large quantities of equipment and his fear that American officers with authority might tend to strengthen the control of the Cabinet over the army and limit his own direct control. It is believed that this question has not yet been fully discussed between General Ridley and the Persian Government. Gendarmerie. 69. Since its separation from the Ministry for War in September 1941 and its return to the Ministry of the Interior, the gendarmerie has suffered all the misfortunes of orphanage. Its administration has been neglected and in its operations it has not often had that support from the army which was the essence of its effectiveness in the time of Reza Shah. It is grossly underpaid, its detach ments are badly housed and almost unfed except for what they can beg or steal. Consequently, its numbers and its morale are low. The miserable conditions offered attract few T volunteer recruits and its numbers are maintained only by drafting to it unwilling conscripts from the army. Owing to its almost complete lack of n transport and means of communication its effectiveness in protecting communications is very limited. The arrival of three American officers as advisers has done very little to improve the state of affairs. They have blinded themselves to the urgent needs of the immediate present by fixing their eyes on a beautiful but quite impractical, ideal organisation, which would only be justified if the army were to be abolished. Given the support of the army the task required from the gendarmerie is not heavy. What is immediately required is an improvement in the conditions of service and some means of mobility and communication. Persian Air Force. 70. The strength of the Imperial Persian air force at the end of 1942 was 2,012 officers, n.c.o.s and enlisted men The flying personnel consisted of 54 officer pilots, 88 sergeant pilots, 67 officer observers. There were 201 aircraft held on charge, of which 123 were serviceable and 78 unserviceable. Of the serviceable aircraft, forty-two machines were of trainer type and the remainder either obsolete or obsolescent. The lack of modern aircraft, the shortage of fuel, oil and spare parts, and the limited number of aerodromes and landing grounds left to the Persian air force rule it out of consideration as a fighting force. Afterthe British and Russian air forces had occupied the permanent stations, work shops and aerodromes considered necessary for their possible future operations, and Polish refugees had been quartered in certain training establishments, the accommodation available for the Persian air force was very limited. I he offer made by the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq and Persia, in return for the handing over of Mehrabad aerodrome, near Tehran, to erect hangars at British expense at Isfahan, whither one regiment of the Persian air force had been sent, was well ■fcceived and did something to soothe ruffled feelings, but even when these nangers have been erected the Persian air force will still suffer considerable incon venience from lack of cover for their aircraft. In spite of this, relations between the Royal Air Force and the Persian air force have been remarkably good. This is due largely to the personality of the late air attache, Group Captain R. R. Greenlaw, and to the obvious desire of the air force authorities to co-operate as far as the demands of their own operational requirements allowed. Assistance, though limited in scope, is being given in flying training and in instruction in meteorology. Good relations have been established at the aircraft factory at Doshan Tappeh, where the Persian staff and workmen work happily under R.A.F. supervision. The factory has been fully occupied on major repairs to aircraft, both Persian and British, and the manufacture of spare parts for the R.A.F. Tribal Policy. 71. The tribal situation in Persia gave much cause for anxiety at the beginning of the year. Reza Shah had committed many injustices against leading personalities among the tribes, and his ruthlessness and centralising policy, and suppression of any form of local autonomy had created great discontent, but at least he had preserved order. The Persian Government appeared unfortunately too weak and vacillating either to remedy the injustices or to keep the tribes effectively in order. Early in the year there were-a number of local minor disorders, and it was feared that if they spread, they might affect our lines of communications. In Gach Saran, in the oil area, for instance, the situation was so serious that a battalion of British troops had to be sent to preserve order. The Persian army, on whom the duty of preserving internal security falls, seemed only just, if at all, capable of dealing with the general situation. It was greatly demoralised after the defeat of 1941, and so lacking in transport that no operations against the tribes could be undertaken on any considerable scale. Feeling in the army was, at the same time, not friendly to the Allies and we could not have full confidence in its attitude in all circumstances. In these conditions some concession to tribal feeling seemed essential. As the result of strong pressure by His Majesty’s Minister, the Prime Minister made a declaration on the 31st March before the Majlis, stating that the Iranian Government was firmly resolved to compensate tribal individuals for genuine injustices and announced the formation of a commission to investigate and rectify injustices without delay. The declaration concluded by repeating the Government's intention to preserve order and internal security. The commission was in due course set up, and if the Minister of Justice in Qawam-es- Saltaneh’s Cabinet has been as helpful as his predecessor, many cases would have been settled. His Majesty’s Legation co-operated with the Ministry of Justice in facilitating land claims and other complaints by tribal leaders during the year. A brief outline of events in the principal tribal areas is given in the succeeding paragraphs. Bakhtiari. 72. The incipient dissidence on the part of Abul Qasim Khan early in the year was satisfactorily settled in May, when he submitted to the Persian Govern ment. Subsequently, General Zahidi, the General Officer Commanding Persian troops of the Isfahan area, nominated Abul Qasim Khan and another Bakhtiari chief to be official representative of the Persian army in Chahar-Mahal. This arrangement proved most unsatisfactory as the khans held up food supplies for Isfahan in order to sell them on the black market, and began to rob the popula tion in the old way. After the elimination of General Zahidi in December, Abul Qasim Khan ceased to enjoy the blessing of the local authorities and at the end of the year the appointment of a regular military governor for the Bakhtiari was under consideration. 73. The grievances of the principal Bakhtiari khans were really three-fold. They wanted to be allowed to repurchase their oil shares, to recover the lands16 taken from them by Reza Shah, and to secure the appointment of a Bakhtiari as Governor. The return of the oil shares was difficult to arrange for technical reasons and was not welcome to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. In spite of a certain amount of pressure by His Majesty's Legation, not much was done by the Persian Government towards the settlement of land claims, and at the end of the year it seemed clear that until a new Minister of Justice was installed, no progress would be made. As regards the third desiderata, the khans chosen Iw General Zahidi were anything but a success as will be seen from the preceedif^ paragraph. 74. It is only fair to say, in conclusion, that it is doubtful whether the interests of the tribesmen coincide with those of the oppressed khans. British prestige was high with the Bakhtiari, who were, however, disappointed that we were not able to do more for them. Fars. 75. Early in March it became clear that trouble was brewing in the Qashgai country. There were rumours of an understanding between Qashgai, Bakhtiari and Boir Ahmadi leaders, and of Germans being harboured in those regions. Nasir Khan, the principal dissident Qashgai leader, was invited by the Persian Government to come to Shiraz to discuss the question of his land claims. He, however, refused and moved further into tribal territory. 76. The Persian troops in Fars were too demoralised to be able to take action against Nasir Khan, and there was also a notable lack of enthusiasm on the part of the Governor-General and General Officer Commanding in Shiraz, Prince Firous. Negotiations with Nasir Khan continued throughout the summer without making any headway. The situation at Fars was closely affected by the military situation and, although it is a matter of conjecture, it seems probable that the intention of those elements m Fars who opposed any action against Nasir was that, in the event of a German victory in the Caucasus, they would have handed over the Government of Fars to him as the preserver of local law and order on behalf of the Germans. Nasir Khan was generally known to be in contact with the Germans and to be harbouring German agents, and those elements in Tehran and in the South of Persia who did not favour the Allied cause, used their influence to ensure that no action should be taken against him, notwithstanding the representations made by His Majesty’s Minister to the Persian Government. The situation was more disquieting since the road from Bushire to Shiraz passed near the Qashgai territory and any serious disorder in the area would have affected the delivery of supplies to Russia by this route. 77. At the end of September Prince Firous and His Majesty’s Consul came to Tehran, where conferences were held with His Majesty’s Legation and the Persian authorities to decide what should be done. The general conclusion that was reached by the Persian Government was that, pending a clarification of the position, steps should be taken to prevent Nasir Khan from increasing his authority. It was suggested to them that this could best be done by making suitable arrangements with the leaders of the sub-tribes- and by re-establishing the authority of the Government in the Firuzabad area, an operation that appeared to be within the capacity of their forces. 78. While Prince Firous was still in Tehran, his subordinates in Fars posted troops on the migration route of the Qashgai tribesmen on their way to their winter quarters and attempted to disarm them with inadequate forces. A Persian detachment was ignominiously disarmed. Nothing effective was done by the Persian authorities either to reoccupy Firuzabad or to diminish Nasir’s authority. However, the German defeats in Africa and in Russia, and the evidence that the British authorities took a serious view of the situation in Fars made Nasir Khan put some water in his wine, and towards the end of the year somewhat desultory negotiations for his submission, involving a guarantee of his life and property by His Majesty’s Government, were in progress. Meanwhile, serious arrangements were being made, with the assistance of the British military authorities and of the American gendarmerie adviser, to ensure the security of the Bushire-Shiraz-Isfahan road, which, however, was only the scene of isolated robberies during the year. Khuzistan. 79. Lawlessness among the Khu-i-Galu tribes caused some anxiety for the safety of A.I.O.C. installations in the Behbehan-Gach Saran area. Little confidence was felt in the ability of the Persian forces to maintain order, and in17 March, in order to reassure the employees of the company, a battalion of British troops was sent to the area. Later in the year a joint examination of the security measures of the area was made by officers detailed by the Persian Ministry for War and the Tenth Army and as a result of their recommendations the local Persian forces were increased. This has improved security but has not entirely prevented tiresome incidents. 80. The Arabs have, on the whole, been reasonably well behaved. Numbers them have found employment with the British forces, and the tribes generally, in the hope of obtaining British support against the Persian Government, have been pro-British in sentiment. Certain lawless elements were, however, unable to refrain from raiding their peaceful neighbours, and in the autumn, with a show of force, the disarmament of these sections was undertaken by the Persian army. That it has been proceeding without bloodshed is largely due to the moderating influence of Colonel Macann, His Majesty’s Consul-General at Ahwaz. on both Arabs and Persians. Kurdistan. 80a. The Persian army suffered a reverse in February when a detachment of troops, occupying iSaqqiz, were dispersed and the town sacked by Kurdish tribesmen. The Persian army re-took Saqqiz in x\pril, and negotiations were opened with the rebel Kurds by Marshal Sfiahbakhti, Persian General Officer Commanding at Kermanshah. As a result of representations by His Majesty’s Minister, special publicity was given in Kurdistan to the Prime Minister s declaration of the 31st March about the remedying of grievances, and leaflets were even dropped from the air. The Governor-General of Kermanshah, Amir-i-Kull, a local landowner, also toured the area with a view to remedying discontents. Hama Rashid, the principal Kurdish rebel, did not himself formally submit to the Persian Government, but his brother was made chief of the gendarmerie and various other members of his family received Government posts. The situation was quiet in South Kurdistan for the rest of the year. 81. Northern Kurdistan and the Kurdish parts of Azerbaijan were largely within the zone where Russian troops were stationed, and Soviet policy towards the Kurds was the subject of considerable speculation throughout the year. 82. Early in the year, it was reported that the Kurdish notables who visited Baku at the end of . 1941 had found considerable encouragement in the Soviet authorities towards their nationalist aspirations. Colour was lent to this allegation by the fact that the Soviets were objecting to the presence of Persian troops in Western Azerbaijan, and prevented them from reinforcing the gendarmerie there. To all intents and purposes the Persian Government lost control in Western Azerbaijan. 83. Early in May a serious incident occurred at Rezaieh, when the depleted forces of the Persian gendarmerie attempted to disarm some Kurds entering the town. A considerable number of Kurds surrounded the town, pillaged the adjacent villages and attacked and disarmed the gendarmerie posts. A great number of people fled from Azerbaijan and official complaints were made hy the Persian Government to the Soviet Government and to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom that they were prevented by the Soviet authorities from preserving order inside Persia. There is little doubt, however, that the Persian Government exaggerated the disorders in order to put the Soviet authorities in the wrong and to support their demand to be allowed to send troops to Azerbaijan. Subsequently, some Persian troops and gendarmerie were sent, with Soviet permission, to Azerbaijan, but the Persians complained that their forces in Rezaieh were virtually kept prisoner by the Russian authori- ties. . . , n . . .. . 84. The objectives of the Russian authorities m behaving with such indulgence towards the Kurds have never been quite clear, but it seems probable that they were anxious to have friendly tribes on the frontier between Azerbaijan and Turkey in the event of the military situation in the Caucasus deteriorating. The Soviet authorities were undoubtedly themselves shocked and surprised by the excesses which the Kurds committed. 84a. The influence of the Soviets with the Kurds was thereafter used to promote order. In July, a hundred Kurdish chiefs were invited to visit the Governor-General of Western Azerbaijan, and were exhorted by him and by the Soviet Consul-General, to behave as good citizens. In August, the Soviet authorities called the Kurdish leaders together at Ushnu, warned them against creating trouble and threatened to take their own measures to suppress any [25481] ' DA disorders which occurred. They also made efforts to bring about a truce among the warring inter-tribal elements, and arranged for Umar Khan of the Shekak tribe to be recognised as the Chief of the Kurds. Certain Kurdish leaders thereafter began to go about with a national flag of their own, and the whole episode aroused the greatest misgiving on the part of the Persian Government, who feared that an attempt was being made by the Russians to encourage separatist aspirations, though in point of fact it seems certain that Russia^ as a result of the detente in her relations with Turkey, had now no further interest in encouraging the Kurds. At the end of the year the situation amongst the Kurds was most uncertain, control on the Turkish and Iraqi frontier, so essential to prevent the harvest being smuggled away, was absolutely non-existent, and adventurous elements among the tribes were producing a state of unrest throughout the Kurdish tribal areas, which were still entirely out of the Persian Government's control. Russian Interests. 85. Russian policy in Persia has very largely remained an enigma. The Persians, who are fundamentally terrified of the Russians and feared the worst after the occupation, have on the whole been surprised that they have not had to suffer Very much from them. During most of the year, moreover, Russian policy seemed to be more or less of a hand-to-mouth nature, owing, no doubt, to the fearful problems which the German drive in South Russia set them. 85a. In the first part of the year under review, however, the Persians continued to make complaints of active Russian interference, particularly in the north. In particular they made strong representations to the Soviet Government in March and April, protesting against the alleged propagandist activities of the Soviet Vice-Consulate at Rezaieh, which was stated to have invited the population to register for Soviet nationality. They also complained that sepaiatist tendencies were being encouraged, contrary to the treaty, by an organisation called The Workers’ Party,” which was under Soviet auspices. It is only fair to say that these complaints were not repeated later on in the year. The Persian Government also complained because they were not granted permission to send more troops to Azerbaijan. „ , o • ^ 86. The Rezaieh incident, in May, and the policy of the Soviet authorities towards the Kurds are described in the section of this report dealing with Kurdistan, and it need only be stated here that the effect of the encouragement which the Soviet authorities gave to a Kurdish movement for unity on Persia s relations with the Soviet Union was to strengthen the Persian belief that the Russians had ultimate designs themselves on Azerbaijan, notwithstanding the provisions of the treaty. , 87. Nevertheless, the official Russian policy seemed, generally speaking (and with notable exceptions), to be one of non-interference in the general affairs of Persia and regardless of what one would have thought were their own war interests, they carried this policy to such lengths as seriously to embarrass the work of this legation in ensuring the security of communications with Russia and in assisting in the carriage of supplies northwards. There are several major instances of this. Thus virtually no assistance could be obtained from the Russians in securitv matters; they would not back up our requests for the arrest of known fifth-columnists, though their security authorities co-operated with ours to some extent, in exchanging information, and on one or two occasions we were helped to secure the removal of suspects from the Russian zone. I he boviet authorities were completely unhelpful in food questions, either m backing up our attempts to secure proper control of hoarding, or to ensure the purchase oft e necessary quantities from the harvest to feed the towns, and they made difficulties about releasing food from their zone in order to feed Tehran, or even to inform us adequately of what quantities they proposed to take away from Persia. It was made clear to the Soviet Government that, while we would not, of course, wish to obiect to their supplying their own needs from Persia, this might mean that sunnlies in replacement of those taken away, would have to be brought from overseas’and transported, in Persia, by rail and that this would necessarily displace a certain quantity of war supplies destined for Russia Perhaps it was to escape this inconvenient dilemma that the Russians hid their hand His MUestv’s Government made representations to the Russian Ambassador in London in November, and were informed officially that permission had been given for 35 000 tons of cereals to he brought from Azerbaijan to Tehran; but hai y anv cereals ever came and the Soviet Government gave so little help to the Persian Government to purchase the necessary quantities for this purpose (indeed, they19 % did everything possible to hamper the work of Mr. Sheridan s representatives in Tabriz) that even the town of Tabriz went short of food in an area renownec for its plenty. This prevaricatory and oriental attitude on the part ot t e Russians made it extremely difficult to co-operate with them at all on the tooc question. . . , , 88. Although the carriage of supplies to Russia depended on the execution of a huge public works programme, on roads, ports and railways, for which large ^\ums of rials were required by the British military authorities, the feoviet Ambassy gave us practically no assistance whatsoever in our representations to the Persian Government about the financial questions which arose. At the end of August the financial and political situation was most difficult, and the supme- ness of the Soviet Embassy was such that His Majesty’s Minister had to ask the Foreign Office to make representations to the Soviet Ambassador in London to ask that the Soviet Charge d’Affaires should receive sufficient discretion to be able to act with us strongly and promptly in case of necessity. Only m November when it was made clear to the Soviet Ambassador that any further delay or failure to settle the financial question would inevitably mean either complete stoppage of supplies to Russia, or direct military action by His Majesty s forces to ensure compliance with their minimum requirements, did the Soviet Ambassador join His Majesty’s Minister in calling personally on the President of the Majlis and explaining that the Deputies could not indefinitely continue to hold up the Allied war effort. ^ n 89 Soviet policy as regards their own needs of rials was dealt with m the enclosure to my despatch No. 91 of the 9th March. Negotiations for a Persian- Soviet financial agreement were still in progress at the end of the year. Possibly their shortage of rials explains a good deal of Soviet policy; for instance, it was doublv important for them to keep food-stuffs inside their zone and to maintain prices at a low level, if they wished to buy food-stuffs themselves without expending a large amount of local currency. Nevertheless, it was undoubtedly convenient for the Russians politically that they should be able to point to a state of plenty in their zone, while we were contributing food-stuffs from our zone to Tehran to the extent of causing some local shortages in places like Kermanshah, Hamadan and Sultanabad. Far from crediting the British with making unselfish efforts on behalf of the capital’s food supply, the people of Tehran were at the end of the year whispering how much better things were under Soviet rule. . . 90. The Russians gave some support to the Tudeh party in internal affairs, and this, combined with a fair amount of radicalism, which began to spread in Persia on account of the appalling corruption and inefficiency of the Government, gave rise to a belief, or at any rate a fear, towards the end of the year, that the Russians were playing a very deep waiting game and were aiming at honey combing the country and eventually securing control of it by a Left-wing movement. This fear was sedulously fostered by the landowners and bourgeoisie, but it is only fair to say that there was little evidence to support it. 91. The Soviets opened a number of consulates in 1942; early in the year they asked for permission to open consulates-general at Tabriz and Meshed, consulates at Resht, Gurgan and Kerman, vice-consulates at Rezaieh, Maku. Nowshah and Bandar-Shah, and consular agencies at Bandar-Shahpur and Bajgiran. The Persian Government made counter-proposals, based on reciprocity, but received nothing in reply but a declaration of sympathy for the principle of the extension of Persian consular work in Soviet Russia—but not during the war; but when the Soviet Ambassador presented a list of officials the Persian Govern ment felt obliged to issue exequaturs. 92. The Soviets subsequently opened consular posts at Isfahan and Ahwaz. Relations between our consulates and the Soviet consulates were friendly and we assisted them in their war propaganda on many occasions. 93. The Soviet Consul at Kermanshah showed more activity than his colleagues elsewhere, and his staff travelled through tribal areas in Kurdistan. On one occasion members of the staff of the Soviet Consulate at Kermanshah spoke indiscreetly and subversively to an Indian military officer in the area, and representations were made on the subject by the Foreign Office to the Soviet Government; the latter, however, denied that there was any truth in this allegation. 94. Throughout the year there were endless difficulties about the grant of passes for British military and civilian personnel who had to go into the Soviet zone on business, e.g., in connexion with the supply of timber, on survey work, or for other purposes, and passes were frequently refused or delayed in most. [25481] e20 inconvenient circumstances and without any adequate reason. Frequently repre sentations to the Soviet Embassy seemed to effect little improvement in this state of affairs, and in general it must be said that with few exceptions the Russians treated all foreigners, British and Americans included, very much like enemy aliens, notwithstanding all efforts that were made to get on better terms with them, and notwithstanding the very liberal policy we pursued in granting all Russian applications for passes to visit South Persia immediately on application. On one occasion the British officers superintending the making of the road ty* Tabriz were all given notices to quit, and there were many difficulties between the Russian and American authorities for the same reason. The British military authorities were, it must be said, sometimes guilty of trespassing in the Soviet zone, of which they were most anxious to obtain information as a possible battlefield where they might have to operate. In June a British mechanised column, on reconnaissance, entered the Soviet zone without previous notice north of Mahabad. 95. The Royal Air Force also had many difficulties with the Russian authorities about the Qaleh-Murgheh aerodrome. A description of the incident and agreement reached will be found in the section on military interests. 96. Many of the difficulties mentioned above seemed to come from the N.K.V.D.. and it is only fair to say that quite friendly relations were established between senior British and Russian officers. General Korolev, the principal Russian transportation officer, was friendly throughout the year, and General Sir E. P. Quinan. General Officer Commanding, Tenth Army, and Air Vice-Marshal de Crespigny, Air Officer Commanding, Persia and Iraq, both visited the Russian General Officer Commanding in Tabriz and established friendly relations with him, though no return visit took place, and the Russian authorities gave away little enough about reconnaissance of the Soviet zone. 97. The Russians did not seem to welcome the arrival of American advisers in Persia, and there is some evidence that at the end of the year, when they began pursuing a more active policy as the fortunes of war changed, they spoke to several Persian Ministers against the principle of having American advisers. They demurred somewhat to the suggestion that the Americans were going to take over control of the southern section of the Trans-Iranian Railway, and at the end of the year had still not expressed their formal approval of it. 98. It seems possible that the Soviet Government were worried at the huge increase of American and British influence in Persia, both in the Central Government and in the provinces, and that they may have feared that we were ourselves playing a “ deep waiting game,” and were going to profit by their war embarrassment and absence from the scene and were steadily getting Persia into our pocket. I can only say that nothing more could have been done than was done to draw the Russians into co-operation with us in all we did. and if they did not co-operate and play their part it was entirely their own doing and was, indeed, extremely embarrassing to us. 99. 1 The Soviet authorities had priority, as between the Allies, in developing the arms factories in Persia. Nothing was done about this during the year, in spite of our representations on the subject, but at the end of the year negotiations were in progress between the Persian Government and the Soviet Government, who were trying to induce the Persian Government to sign a most onerous contract. The Persians doubted their capacity to fulfil the proposed contract, and feared that failure on their part to do so would lead to direct control and exploitation by the Russians not only of the arms factories, but also of the mineral and other resources on which they depended. American Interests. 100. A very great increase of American participation in developments in Persia occurred during the year. Many public works of military interest in the South of Persia were constructed by American engineers, and at the end of the year the operation of the southern section of the Trans-Iranian Railway was slowly being transferred from British to American personnel. Increased American participation in road transport was also expected. American advisers were functioning or were expected to start work in all important branches of the administration. 101. There were advantages both from the Persian and from the Allied point of view in closer co-operation between the Persian and United States Governments. Owing to the inability of the Persian Administration to cope with the formidable problems resulting from the war, the appointment of foreign advisers to various Ministries became essential. We should have been unable, &gt; * ✓ V21 t 0 ft. ✓ V * f' owing to the strain of war, to produce the necessary number of first-class advisers ourselves, and, if we had done so, Russian suspicions might well have been aroused. Moreover, the Persians were afraid of the citizens of neighbouring powers, always suspecting ulterior intentions. The Americans represented for them the virtues of the Anglo-Saxon nations without any of the disadvantages. In the course of the summer and autumn, a number of American advisers were engaged to deal with food and supply questions (Mr. Sheridan), the gendarmerie (Colonel —Schwarzkopf) and the police (Mr. Timmerman). An American adviser on irri gation was already engaged in the employ of the Ministry of Agriculture. A financial mission under Dr. A. C. Millspaugh was expected at the end of the year. General Greely became adviser to the Intendant-General’s Department of the Persian Ministry of War; he was subsequently succeeded by General Ridley. There was much discussion during the year as to the need for an American Military Mission. His Majesty’s Legation was in favour of this, but various objections were raised and the project did not materialise. 102. The American Legation was represented on the Civil Supplies Committee and the Road Transport Board, and the United States Government was a party to the Food Agreement signed in November. 103. The Lease-Lend system was promised to Persia during the year; the possible grant of this concession by the United States Government was one of the principal inducements to the Persian Government to expel the Japanese Legation in April, but the Persians were most disappointed that, owing to shipping difficulties, they will derive so little benefit from it. 104. The American Legation did not always take the same view of Allied requirements as did His Majesty’s Legation and co-operation was often rendered difficult by the somewhat tortuous character of the American Minister, whom the Persians frequently tried to influence against us. The American Legation effectively wrecked an attempt made to rationalise Persian road transport through the U.K.C.C. in the summer, owing to their fear of any sort of monopoly, and the United States Government made representations in London regarding our arrest of General Zahidi in November. Mr. Dreyfus generally avoided supporting our representations on questions of general importance to the Allies and left His Majesty’s Minister to bear the whole burden of unpopular representations to the Persian Government. Fortunately his staff was most friendly and helpful, hut if more co-operation had been forthcoming from the American Minister in pressing the Persian Government to take the measures which were essential to solve the urgent problems of the year, much less trouble would have been experienced and, incidentally, we should not have had to bear all the odium of them. This might have had an appreciable effect on our relations with Persia. Mr. Bullitt visited Tehran in January; Mr. Harriman passed through with Mr. Churchill on his way to and from Moscow in August. Mr. Wendel Willkie visited Tehran in September. 105. The United States Government was invited by the Persian Govern ment to adhere to the Anglo-Soviet-Persian Treaty of Alliance in autumn with a view to regularising the position of the United States forces in Persia. The question of the best means of doing this was still under consideration at the end of the year. Polish Interests. 106. Large numbers of Poles, carried off into the interior of Russia when Poland was overrun, were liberated by the Russians in the course of the year and were sent out through Persia. The first Polish evacuation in April included 33,000 soldiers and 10,000 civilians. The latter were evacuated in the autumn to East Africa. The second evacuation included 43,000 soldiers and 25,000 civilians. In spite of efforts to evacuate the civilians out of Persia, where their presence was undesirable, both from a military point of view and on account of the difficulties of feeding such a considerable increase of the European popula tion, there were at the end of the year still about 22,000 Poles in Persia. 107. His Majesty’s Minister undertook that the Poles should not be a burden on Persian economy and special imports of wheat and sugar, tea and cloth were arranged for their needs. The Middle East Refugee Relief Administration established an organisation in Tehran to superintend and co-ordinate arrange ments for the refugees under Colonel A. Ross. In spite of these arrangements, the presence of the Polish refugees was a complicating factor in the delicate economic and food position in Tehran, for which the Allies received most of the blame.22 French Interests. 108. In January M. Coiftard, the Vichy French Charge d’Affaires, wrote a hasty and ill-conceived letter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the implications of the proposed Anglo-Soviet-Persian Treaty and sent copies to the press. He accused the Persian Government of misleading the Persian people and of acting against their wishes. This gave the Allies an excuse they were waiting for to get rid of M. Coiffard, whose activities were most detrimental to our interests; he was informed by the Persian Government that he w^p^ 'persona non grata and left Tehran at the end of January. 109. Free French interests were in the hands of Professor Andre Godard, who was appointed Delegate of General de Gaulle at the end of February. Professor Godard was officially recognised by the Persian Government as the representative of the Free French National Committee in June; although his name does not appear on the diplomatic list, he exercises virtually all the functions of a Minister Plenipotentiary. Relations with the free (later “ Fighting ”) French were cordial throughout the year. Czech Interests. 110. The Persian Government recognised the Czechoslovak Government in June and the Czechoslovak Legation was formally opened on the 24th June by General Ingr, the Czechoslovak Minister of Defence, with Dr. Frantisek Bachtik as charge d’affaires.f /s)o£ C. ce Agm i r ^ Pti. boCUMENT IS THE PROPERT^-e* 4«S BRITAJ1IUC MAJEST Y’S GOYERNMEWT 31 MAY 1944 PERSIA.

O m Anglo-Persian Relations. 1. During 1943 Persian cabinets came and went in gloomy procession with little to distinguish them from each other in composition and quality. Each bore the traces to a remarkable degree of those three well-known Persian characteristics: dishonesty, inefficiency and inertia. The more the political pack was shuffled and reshuffled, the more drab the hands became without even the appearance of a joker to break the monotony and enliven the scene. For practically the whole year the destinies of the country were in the hands of M. Soheily, that prince of indecision and champion political tight-rope walker, and it was, therefore with him as Prime Minister and his companions that all our official business had to be transacted. For Anglo-Persian relations it was not an entirely happy year, though far easier than its predecessor. The Persian ship of State weathered many storms in an inexplicable manner and at the close of the voyage had reached comparatively calm water. This may bode well for the future, but in a country like Persia it is better to refrain from reckless prophecy. 2. In times of peace Persia has a special interest and importance for us, but war has multiplied the importance of those interests out of all recognition in view of the widespread responsibilities, both direct and indirect, now placed on the shoulders of ourselves and our Allies. At present Persia constitutes first and foremost the vital supply line for carrying aid to Russia and, although the operation of the Trans-Iranian railway was transferred on the 1st April to the American military authorities, responsibility for the security of the rail way as well as for that of the other lines of communications required for military supplies from the south remained vested in the British military forces. In .addition, the protection of the oilfields from tribal and other disturbances -provided our troops with a further heavy responsibility. Persia, too, is perhaps fnt ie only country in which Anglo-Soviet-American interests meet in an acute 5form and, if not carefully handled, are liable to clash. A spanner thrown into I_t}ie Allied machinery by an artful Persian may do untold harm. It is in the Hight of these considerations and of the inherent weakness of the structure of i the Persian State that our policy in this country during the last year should ilbe judged. As is well known, the Persian economy has, under war conditions, -T [52—82] b2 failed to carry unaided the burden which it has been called to shoulder in the economic, financial, military and other spheres, and in order to carry out efficiently our vital war responsibilities here, we and our Allies were forced into a considerable measure of interference in many branches of the Persian Administration, which we should naturally have preferred to avoid. Further, as the success of our war effort depends to such an extent on caln^^ and stability throughout the country, that measure of interference which haqi^ taken shape in 1942 was necessarily developed and extended in the year under review. For instance, the complete inability of the Persian Government to maintain order in large areas of the south, which will be dealt with more fully in another section of this despatch, compelled us at one time to provide military protection for convoys on the Bushire—Shiraz—Isfahan road, whilst later the presence of Germans with the Qashgai tribes, which constituted a potential danger of sabotage to the Trans-Iranian railway and the oilfields, called for similar intervention, for lawlessness and insecurity could not fail to affect our vital interests. At the end of the year a measure of peace has been restored and that was our principal immediate consideration. Again, under war conditions the outcome of the general elections could not be without interest to us. Consular officers were accordingly instructed to encourage and support those elements that appeared to be honest and animated by public spirit. 3. Generally speaking, our policy in the economic field was to concentrate on increasing our contribution to the welfare of the Persian people to the greatest extent consistent with the carriage of the necessary supplies to Russia. The principal element in the promotion of their welfare could only be internal reform, which we encouraged to the best of our ability, and the reorganisation of the provision and the distribution of essential goods. Consequently, when Dr. Millspaugh arrived in Persia in February as Administrator-General of Finances, in order to cope with the chaotic financial situation, and pressed for wide powers to control prices, reorganise the system of taxation and balance the budget, &amp;c., he had our fullest backing in all his measures. Similarly, every occasion was taken by us to support the American advisers in other branches of the Administration in the hope that their labours might bring some benefit to the departments concerned.- Throughout the year cereals, transport and civil supplies presented serious problems. There again, all our efforts were directed towards alleviating distress as far as the general war situation would permit The full quota of wheat was imported under our Food Agreement of 1942; British Consuls and Consular Liaison Officers continued to work at high pressure in the provinces to ensure the collection of the Government- share of the grain crop; and at the close of the year the British army averted a shortage of wheat in Tehran by transporting some 10,000 tons of wheat from Kermanshah and Hamadan to railhead. An Allied Road Transport Board was set up and Lease- Lend lorries were supplied, and in this way a semblance of organisation was introduced into the civil transport system. In addition, steps were taken to increase the supply of consumer goods, particularly from India, and to allocate additional tonnage for civil supplies on the Trans-Iranian railway. On the financial side the' acute shortage of currency notes was eased by the arrival of considerable consignments from the United Kingdom. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, too, assisted Dr. Millspaugh by making advances to the Persian Government on the oil royalties payable in 1943/44. 4. All the measures which we and our American Allies took to alleviate the lot of the poorer classes and to establish some order in the corrupt and antiquated machine of Government aroused the most bitter opposition from Persian vested interests both in the Majlis and elsewhere. Unfortunately, gratitude is a quality which is lacking in the Persian make-up. Economic distress was almost invariably ascribed to British inefficiency and machiavellian intentions. This campaign undoubtedly had a deplorable effect on our popularity and it unfortunately acquired some show of justifkyition when, at the beginning of the year, owing to the unforeseen interruption of the rail traffic and other causes for which the British were not responsible, Tehran was threatened with a serious shortage of oil. The public had naturally been greatly influenced by the fulminations of the press at our expense, which for long periods were allowed to continue their campaigns unchecked by the Government. These attacks might have become even more violent if it had not been for our victories in the various theatres of war. Fortunately, towards the end of the year with Persia’s declaration of war on Germany and her adherence to the United Nations, and the issue of the Tehran Declaration, the position returned to normal and there was little to complain of in the attitude of the press. It was at times rather galling that Soviet Russia, having done little or nothing to help[52—82] ® 2 the Persian economy and at times having even acted in a manner detrimental to vital Persian interests, should remain immune from attack. The Persian attitude, however, towards Russia remains one of deep respect based on fear. As a Persian journalist once said : “ We do not attack the Russians because they kidnap people!” It is a case of the Persian cat purring at full blast if the Russian bear will only refrain from growling! 5. Early in July the Persian Government notified the Soviet, American and ^British Representatives of their decision to adhere to the Declaration of the ’'United Nations, and asked to be informed as to what additional obligations Persia would thereby incur and what advantages she would secure. An agreed rep]y by the three Governments was in due course returned to the general eftect that (a) Persia would on entering into a state of war with one or more of the Axis Powers become eligible for adherence to the Declaration of the United Nations, (b) such adherence would not entail for Persia additional economic or military obligations, and (c) Persia would enjoy the benefits of full partnership with the thirty-two United Nations, and would have equal rights with them to participate in the appropriate conferences connected with the peace settlement. 6. On the 9th September war was officially declared on Germany, and Persia finally adhered to the Declaration of the United Nations on the 14th September. Up to that time Persia had really been an unwilling and purely nominal ally. | However, the actual declaration of war, while not altering the situation funda- i mentally, produced a psychological change in the Persian people, considerably S strengthened the position and prestige of the Government, and provided it with a 1 readv-made justification for taking strong action against Axis sympathisers. In ! fact Persia felt that she had at last become a full-blown ally. The news was well received by the Majlis and the press, and gave intense satisfaction to the Shah, who had always been keen on closer participation in the war, though for reasons of his own connected with the morale and equipment of the army. It was only the relatives of those serving in the army who bewailed the event, fearing that their menfolk would be called upon forthwith to proceed on active service. 7. It was not long before Persia figured in the limelight again, although to a minor degree. The Secretary of State passed through Tehran in October on his way to the Moscow Conference. Considerable interest and even apprehension was aroused in official circles, as it was feared that independent decisions might be taken at the expense of Persia. As it turned out, the British and American Representatives were unable owing to Soviet opposition to secure agreement on the issue of a declaration which wxmld have reassured Persia as to the intentions of the Allies. On their return journey to Tehran the American delegation informed the Persian Government that during the Conference the Russians had repeatedly declared their intention to execute the provisions of the Tripartite Treaty of 1942. This gave general satisfaction and relief. According to the British records of the meetings, however, it would have been more accurate to say that the Soviet delegation considered reaffirmations of the treaty as unnecessary, as the Persian Government had complete confidence in the intentions of the Allies. Ihis no doubt could be taken to imply that the Soviet Government intended to honour their treaty obligations. Tehran Conference. 8. For Persia all other events of the year were overshadowed by the historic Tehran Conference, which was attended by President Roosevelt, Marshal Stalin and Mr. Churchill and their staffs, and lasted from the 27th November to the 2nd December. The meeting, which passed off without a hitch, excited the interest and flattered the vanity of the Shah, the Government and the whole nation, in that Tehran had been chosen as the seat of such an important conference. For reasons of security the strictest measures in regard to secrecy had to be observed, and the news of‘the impending arrival of President Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill was only communicated to the Persian Government a very short time in advance. In the case of Marshal Stalin, longer notice was given by the Soviet Embassy without our knowledge. This veil of secrecy, which virtually prevented official visits and entertainment, caused some slight resentment and disappointment to the Shah and the Persian Government. It was quickly dissipated, however, by the issue of the Anglo-Soviet-American Declaration. 9. When the Secretary of State called on the Persian Prime Minister on the 29th November, the latter stated that Tehran was expecting that some communique relating to Persia would appear as a result of the conference, and suggested the lines on which such a communique should be based. A similar appeal was made to Mr. Churchill by the Shah. The Persian Government clearly knew that the Britishand the Americans were both sympathetic, and that all that was required was to secure the assent of the Russians. In the cordial atmosphere prevailing their assent was secured without difficulty, and a Declaration was eventually issued (a) recognising the assistance given by Persia in the war effort, (b) agreeing to continue economic assistance to Persia, (c) expressing readiness to give full consideration to any economic problems confronting Persia at the end of the war, and (d) confirming the independence and territorial integrity of Persia. This Declaration which naturally added to the prestige of the Shah and the Prime ^ Minister, gave Persia all that she had asked for and was hailed by the nation as the first occasion on which a country had been given such a guarantee by the three Great Powers. ^ n j 10. It was in the course of the Conference that took place, both the handing over by Mr. Churchill of the Stalingrad sword to Marshal Stalin at the Soviet Embassy, and the celebration on the 30th November of Mr. Churchill’s 69th birthday by a dinner party in the dining room of the British Legation in the presence of President Roosevelt and Marshal Stalin. These historic events served to reflect the close spirit of friendship and cordiality pervading the whole atmosphere of the Tehran meeting. Indian-Persian Relations. 11. In the spring of 1943 the Persian Government expressed a desire to send a Trade Representative to India in order to develop commercial relations between the two countries. The Government of India concurred, and His Excellency, M. Allahyar Saleh, a former Persian Minister of Finance, left Persia in November for Bombay, where he has set up his headquarters as Persian Trade Commissioner in India. 12. A project which had been under consideration by the Government of India for some time, for the appointment of an Indian Trade Commissioner to Persia with headquarters at Tehran, has now been approved. 13. Early in 1943 the Government of India sent Major Naqvi, formerly of the Indian C.I.D., to study the Indian community in this country with special reference to anti-British and pro-Axis activities. ' x\s a result of Major Naqvi’s report on his return to India the Government of India requested that the Persian Government be asked to withdraw the 'permis de sejour of eight Indians. The Persian Government agreed to do so and the Indians were arrested under the Defence of India Act as they crossed the Indo-Persian frontier. As a sequel to this, the Government of India are sending Major Naqvi back to Tehran, where he will be attached to the consulate as a temporary measure in order to continue, under the supervision of the Additional Counsellor, his study of the Indian community in Persia. His first duty will be to cultivate the' better types of Indian, and consider in what ways they can best be helped—whether in trade matters, army contracts or in any legitimate grievances they may have against Persian officials or others. At the same time he will keep a watch for pro-Axis or anti-British activities on the part of Indians. 14. 'Towards the end of the year the Government of India extended an invitation to the Persian Government, through His Majesty’s Legation, to send a small Cultural Mission to visit a number of Indian Universities’. It was contemplated that the tour should begin and end with a few days in Delhi and take approximately a month in all. The Government of India'have offered to be responsible for all accommodation and travelling arrangements and expenses from the moment the Mission reached Delhi till it left Delhi at the end of the tour. 15. The Government of India, on being asked for a contribution of cloth to the Anglo-Iranian Relief Fund, made a generous gift of Rs. 50,000 worth of thick and thin cloth suitable for winter and summer clothing for men and women At the end of the year the cloth was on its way to Zahidan from India. Soviet Interests. 16. Soviet policy in Persia remained during 1943 somewhat of an enigma. Officially it was based on strict non-interference in Persian internal affairs;'that was invariably the attitude adopted by the Soviet Embassy whenever they’ were approached for their views or concerted action on any issues which happened to arise during the year. Their real intentions were difficult to fathom, and it may be that they had not clearly made up their minds about long-term policy in this country. From the short-term point of view it was clear, however, that they were studiously preparing the ground by all forms of propaganda, pressure and quiet interference to serve their interests as circumstances might later require. In spite of these difficulties and the natural language barrier this legation made every5 * -A effort to work in the closest harmony with the Soviet authorities and to give them no cause for complaint, but unfortunately the Soviet Embassy seemed quite incapable of acting without clear-cut instructions from Moscow, and in any case the views of the embassy often carried little weight, when the interests of the Soviet army or other authorities were directly concerned. At times there was a surprising lack of frankness and candour in questions which concerned the Allied ^-to^ar eft or t in Persia, and any move on our part was invariably viewed with deep '“vuspicion. It was only in cases where ££ Aid to Russia ” and Soviet war interests demanded some measure of Allied collaboration that the Soviet Embassy displayed more willingness to co-operate. (For instance, the Soviet Embassy collaborated with us over the arrest of the Persian suspects in August, and over the variety of air matters which arise out of the fact that Tehran is the junction point of the British and Russian air spheres). The absence of a Soviet Ambassador for many months of the year did not render our task any more easy, but fortunately the victories in the Mediterranean, and later the more cordial atmosphere generated by the Moscow and Tehran conferences, were necessarily reflected in varying degree in the attitude of the Soviet authorities in Persia. 17. The Soviet authorities have continued to show particular interest in Central and Southern Persia and increasing suspicion of British and American policy. For instance, a Soviet scientific expedition toured Southern Persia at the beginning of the year, whilst Soviet consular officers have increased their activities, particularly at Kermanshah, in connexion wuth political, economic and tribal conditions in various parts of Persia. The Soviet authorities have I constantly asked for information about road and aerodrome construction by the British army and our troop movements in Eastern Persia and have gradually extended their military posts southwards. On the other hand they, for their part, have refused to issue passes to British military personnel to visit places where Russian troops are stationed, unless they are satisfied that their journey is directly concerned with the furtherance of aid to Russia, or to agree to a British liaison officer residing at Tabriz. This attitude of suspicion, which is characteristic and hardly surprising in view of past history, has been much increased by the support which we have consistently given to the American advisers in this country. No doubt a deep-seated fear exists that the influence of the Americans in the administration of the Government will in some way or other react adversely on Russia, e.q., by producing some semblance of order out i of the existing chaos. There is little doubt that the Soviet Embassy are working | against the American advisers. Other grounds for suspicion are our alleged support of Seyyid Zia, who returned to Persia in October. The reason for this attitude is not entirely clear, as he has never been associated with anti-Soviet policy; in fact, it was during his premiership that the Anglo-Persian Agreement of 1919 was rejected. The strong campaign launched against him was presumably based on the fact that he had lived so long in Palestine and was therefore regarded as an instrument of British Imperialism. 18. As was to be expected, the Soviet Embassy took an exceptionally keen interest and part in the general elections. The ground was well prepared, as closer contact by the Persians with the Russians, their discipline and morale and their sympathy for the lower classes had greatly affected preconceived ideas of the Soviet system. They began to be looked upon as the champions of the oppressed and as possible supporters of revolution against the present ruling classes. The Tudeh or Left party was undoubtedly inspired and supported financially and otherwise by the Soviet authorities, however much they may deny this. Although the election results must have been rather disappointing to the Russians, they managed to secure the return of a few Tudeh candidates in the north, who will be more or less subservient to their views. The Tabriz elections, when completed, will probably include more Soviet proteges. The bogy of a large Soviet party in the Majlis has not materialised. 19. Soviet propaganda has been extremely active. Large increases in cultural activities, films and exhibitions have been noticeable. As a counterblast perhaps to the military hospital which we opened in Tehran for Persian typhus patients, the Russians offered to place their military services at the disposal of the Persian health services for preventing the spread of epidemics. In addition, a well-equipped Russian hospital was opened in Tehran, though it does not cater exclusively, or even mainly, for the poor. Their main weapon of propaganda, however, has been the press, and certain organs are known to be the mouthpiece of the Soviet Embassy, especially in their campaigns against Seyyid Zia. 20. It is in economic issues that co-operation with the Soviet Embassy has6 ' proved particularly difficult. The cereul shortage at the beginning of the jeai was due largely to the failure of the northern zone to make that contribution in grain which, as the most fertile part of Persia, it might have been expec e o do, and had in fact always done hitherto. It is difficult to decide to what extent this was due to a definite Russian prohibition and to what extent to Russian acquiescence—unlike the active co-operation with the Persian authorities wnic we showed in the south—in the slackness of the landowners and the officials^ Both factors were present, and the Russians niade a virtue out or tnen an social attitude, for they fostered the absurd opinion that if there was more too in the north than in the south, this was because the Russians were more generous than the British to the Persian population. Owing to shortage of wheat, the bread issued in Tehran at the controlled price remained poor in qualitv foi ihe first two or three months of the year, but the quality was just beginning o improve with the arrival of the first consignments of the 25,000 tons of wheat promised to Persia by the British and American Governments m the previous year, when the Soviet Government, without consulting the British or Americans (who. of course, had kept them fully informed of the progress of their negotiations of the previous year and had even suggested that Russia should sign the wheat agreement even if only as a gesture) suddenly announced that they would supply 25,000 tons of wheat for Persia. The Supply Department^ suggested that the Soviet Government should not take from Azerbaijan the 5,000 tons of wheat they had induced the Persian Government to sell them and should reduce bv that amount the wheat to be supplied from Russia, but this would ha\e reduced the publicitv value of the Soviet offer and the sanctimonious reply was gi\en that this was impossible as the whole of the 25,000 tons from Russia was meant for the poor of Tehran. In spite of this the British and American representatives made further attempts after the 1943 harvest to secure Russian co-operation m the matter of grain supplies for Tehran and other large towns. 1 he Soviet Ambassador declared that the Soviet authorities would not need any wheat (they continued, however, to collect the arrears of the 5,000 tons for which they had contracted, as well as the rest of the 15,000 tons of barley). Later they even admitted that the north ought to contribute 40.000 tons for the feeding of the rest of Persia, and promised to assist in the carriage of this grain, both by rail and, where necessary, by the back-loading of motor lorries working under Iransovtrans. By the end of the year one-fifth of this programme had been fulfilled and the prospects for its complete execution were poor. 21. The Soviet policy of aloofness applied in the same way to transport and civil supplies. Wishing no doubt to escape responsibility, as well as to remain free from its regulations, the Soviet authorities did not keep their promise to participate in the activities of the Allied Road transport Board. Similarly they took no part in the Allied effort to organise civil supplies, but simply sold goods (often direct to merchants) in an attempt to obtain rials and to develop their trade regardless of Middle East Supply Centre and Persian control. In some cases Soviet action entailed a serious burden for the Persian economy, as, for instance, the Soviet-Persian Financial Agreement, which was in much less generous terms than our own, and the Munition Factories Agreement for the supply of rifles, &amp;c., to the Soviet Government under such conditions that only loss could accrue to Persia. At the end of the year no price had even been fixed by the Russians for the payment of munitions supplied. 22 Russian influence with the Shah has increased to a noticeable degree since the appointment of General Razmara in October as Chief of the Shah s Military Cabinet. This officer is known to be well disposed towards Russia and hostile to the American advisers, and he will no doubt be used by the Russians to counteract Anglo-American influence. Further, at the time of the Tehran Conference, the Shah was deeply flattered by the visit paid to him by Marshal Stalin at the Palace, particularly in view of the sympathy which His Majesty felt that he had found in the Marshal for his personal ambitions and the security of his position as Shah. The Russian offer of aircraft and tanks made on that occasion flattered the weakness which the Shah shares with his father and predecessor for an army which looks impressive rather than for one adapted to the needs of the country. It is not surprising, therefore, that very soon afterwards the Shah removed from office the Ministers of War and Interior, the only two strong men in the Cabinet, in view of their supposed anti-Russian views. Stalin’s advice in favour of strong personal rule and a large army was strange, coming as it did from a person whose embassy was openly backing the Tudeh party, whose members had hitherto been violently opposed to both.7 A mericcin Interests. 23. American advisers in the different branches of the Persian Adminis tration played a prominent part during the year and in spite of the constant obstruction with which they were faced from vested interests and other circles succeeded in making considerable progress. Dr. Millspaugh arrived m February to take over the post of Administrator-General of Finances and gradually built '^p around him an American staff and organisation to enable him to cope with the chaotic state of the country in the financial and economic fields. Transport, finance, cereals and other civil supplies all presented serious problems and as the result of the co-operation eventually established between this legation and the American authorities many obstacles were overcome and adequate organisations set up to deal with important issues. On all occasions the American advisers could rely on our warm support and sympathetic understanding ot their difficulties. . , . , • ^ i ^ 24. Close contact was maintained by this legation with Mr. feheriaan, the American Food Adviser, in his efforts to feed the country, provide for the maximum possible collections for the next harvest, and secure funds and transport to put his plans into effect. He had the benefit of our constant advice, and Oi officers, but he proved unequal to the task and m August he resigned. He was replaced by Mr. Crawford as Chief of the Cereals and Bread » ection. he Alheu Road Transport Board, with Anglo-iVmerican-Persian representation, which had been set up to remedy the defects in the Persian civil transport system and to supply lorries, &amp;c., under a system of control to the Persian Road 1 ran sport Department, worked harmoniously and in spite of disappointments, did much to improve conditions. Mr. Birkle, head of the department, left m the summer, and pending a permanent successor, was replaced by Mr. \ivian and the stall was strengthened by the addition of several Anglo-Saxon assistants. I he Angle American control of civil supplies has also operated smoothly. 25. Dr. Millspaugh has proved an honest and conscientious public servant. He has, unfortunately, suffered from bad health, and his inelasticity of vision, his tendency towards centralisation and his failure, due in part to ignorance of any language but English, to establish direct contact with and to consult more ireelv competent Persian authorities before reaching decisions, have at times exposed him to strong criticism. In addition he has had to lace the inevitable opposition on the part of the Russians, who are suspicious of any developmert of American influence here. Similar difficulties have been experienced by the American military advisers. In spite of this Dr. Millspaugh has much to show to his credit, as a result of his uphill struggle. He obtained special powers and secured the passage of the budget and Bills for the reform of the income tax law, the provision of sixty American advisers, the issue of Treasury bonds, &amp;c. 26. The transfer of the control of the operation of the Trans-Iranian railway from the British to the American authorities was completed on the 1st April Responsibility for the security of the line and allocation of tonnage were still vested,, however, in the British authorities. Although at first some dislocation of traffic necessarily occurred, the handling of the railway has proved efficient, whilst the co-operation which we obtained from the American army authorities in rounding up Persian suspects on the railway in August could not have been more effective. By the end of the year no agreement similar to the Tripartite Treaty of 1942 had been signed by the American and Persian Govern ments to regularise the position of American troops in Peisia. dhe terms of an American-Persian Financial Agreement have been drawn up and in operation for some time. According to the agreement, which has not yet been signed, the United States authorities provide the Persian Government with dollars against all rials required by the United States and are ready to exchange all these dollars for gold. It has been made clear to us that it is not the intention of the American Government to vary the rate of exchange without prior consultation with His Maiesty’s Government. . . . TTr . . 27. An American-Persian Commercial Agreement was signed m Washington on the 8th April. . ^ 28. In spite of the rather shifty and weak attitude of the United States ^ Minister our relations with the United States Legation have, on the whole, been very satisfactory, in fact, far more so than those existing between the United States Legation' and their own military. These have been marked by a distinct coldness and, have frequently been the subject of complaint to me by my United States colleague and of hints by the American General Officer Commanding. In a country like Persia, where whole-hearted collaboration is all important in Allied assistance in the provinces through the labours of our consular liaison8 interests, it is unfortunate that we have been unable to secure more sincere co-operation from Mr. Ureyfus. He left for America on leave after the Tehran Conference, and in his absence Mr. Ford, the charge d’affaires, has proved an ideal colleague. Polish Interests. 29. A dual authority administered the Polish refugees from the Soviet - Union. On the Polish side was the Polish Civil Delegation directly dependent 1 on the Polish Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in London. On the British side was a small organisation set up by the Middle East Relief Refugee Association, Cairo, at the instance of the Minister of State. 30. The opening of the year found an acute situation among the refugees. In Persia there remained a total of about 24,000 (not 22,000, as stated in last year’s review) of whom 15,500, including 500 sick, were in camps near Tehran, 2,500 were in Isfahan (including 1.700 children), 3,300 were in Ahwaz, 860 were in hospital and 2,000 were living in Tehran itself. These figures did, however, represent a small reduction on the maximum number of 25,700 which had existed in October 1942. The number of sick also showed a reduction from a maximum of over 2,000 in September 1942. 31. There were three main problems connected with the Polish refugees. The first was economic; the acute shortage of wheat and certain other staple commodities in Persia was used by many malevolent and irresponsible persons to blame the presence of the Poles in Persia for this state of allairs. Arrange ments had been made to import all the flour, tea and sugar which the Poles had been using and which they would in future require and there was little or no ;truth in these asseverations; such other items as were required were available in the country without affecting the ordinary consumption of the Persian population. With the diminution of the number of Poles to 9,500 by the end of the year, this situation improved considerably. The next problem was political; here again ill-meaning agents used the presence of Poles as an excuse for attacking their British sponsors. These attacks have ceased, though there is no guarantee that they will not be renewed. The third problem was that of transport; in spite of various considered programmes involving the apportionment of shipping for Polish needs, the problem of transporting the Poles overseas was always acute. The number of ships available was nearly always much less than had been expected; at the same time the necessity for keeping the Polish transit camp at Ahwaz filled to capacity was due to the fact that ships were liable to arrive at any time without due warning and had, owing to general exigencies of shipping- space, to carry away a full complement of passengers. 32. The total number of Polish men, women and children evacuated during the year was about 14,500. A large majority went overseas to East Africa or to India; a small proportion were sent to Palestine and some who had relations in the Polish armed forces in the United Kingdom joined them there; a few, whose number did not exceed 2,000, left via Karachi bound for Mexico. Recruiting among the refugees continued throughout the year; 800 young men joined the Polish army and 2,600 young women joined the Polish A.T.S., Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A. 760 boys and 250 girls also joined the youth organisations. (These figures refer to 1942 and 1943.) All these were sent to Palestine to join the Polish armed forces there. 33. The morale of the Poles as a whole remained at a fairly low ebb: uncertainty as to their future fate, the relations of their Government with Moscow, failure to provide shipping and lack of employment were all responsible for this. Employment was, nevertheless, found for more than 3,000 Poles throughout most of the year, mainly in various Polish official institutions; about 850 found work with the British and American armed forces and a few with the Lmited Kingdom Commercial Corporation and similar organisations. British Military Interests. 34 The special Military Governor of Abadan Island, Police-Colonel Hatemi, took up his duties early in the year. This appointment, however, did not lead to an improvement in the measures for the security of the refinery precincts for which the Persian Government were responsible, as Colonel Hatemi shirked responsibility and was incapable of taking any action without referring to Tehran. _ Continuous pressure had, therefore, to be applied on the Persian Prime Minister to obtain the execution of the measures required. In July His Majesty’s Legation asked for the removal of Colonel Hatemi; at the samemmm 9 time it was decided to entrust the military and the police duties of his post to two separate persons, and in September Colonel Doulatshahi and Colonel Wakar were appointed military governor and chief of police. In April Lieutenant- Colonel W. Y. Gow had Seen appointed as political adviser in Abadan to the Persia and Iraq Command, in the hope that the military governor would be guided and invigorated by his advice, and in October he was succeeded by Colonel J. Underwood (a former military attache at this legation) with the title of Political Adviser for the Province of Khuzistan. By the end of the year Colonel Underwood was able to report that security measures in the Abadan area had improved and that at present conditions gave no cause for al^ i m - Furthermore, a number of measures had been taken, or were impending, to improve the efficiency and terms of service of the Persian police in the area. 35. At the beginning of the year His Majesty’s Government considered, the-question of civil defence duties for British nationals in Persia, in the light of the changed military situation in Russia. They concluded that whereas the risk of air attack was now remote it remained essential to protect Abadan against the risks of sabotage or accidents due to special war conditions. They decided, therefore, to apply to the Province of Khuzistan Regulation 29 B.B. of the Defence (General) Regulations, 1939, and on the 7th May His Majesty’s Minister signed an order under paragraph 7 of Regulation 29 B.B. requiring British nationals (including Indians) in Khuzistan to undertake civil defence duties. 36. Relations between the British and the Persian authorities and people were on the whole good. The Persian Government made a number of complaints against the British troops in Persia. Most of these, however, were petty. Many also were sweeping, unsubstantiated and out-of-date, so His Majesty s Legation had frequently to point out to the Persian Government that no action could be taken to satisfy them unless they gave chapter and verse promptly. The only serious incidents occurred as a result of the persistent pilfering of British army property, notably telegraph wire, since nothing short of forcible measures sufficed to reduce the pilfering. In April His Majesty’s Legation had to inform the Persian Government that telephone poles erected by the British forces wounl be surrounded by a barbed wire fence inside which explosive charges would be placed, while explosive charges would also be attached to the lines themselves. Later in the month an Indian officer shot dead five Persians whom he declared he had caught in flagrante stealing telegraph cable. The Persian Government made a violent protest regarding this incident, to which His Majesty’s Legation replied with vigour, defending the officer’s action. Unfortunately the same officer four days later shot an orange seller on very flimsy grounds; his action was found to be unjustified, and the British military authorities therefore agreed to pay compensation in this case. In December His Majesty’s Legation had to request the Persian Government to remove the Governor of Qum, on the grounds that he was not co-operating with the British forces in suppressing the pilfering of telegraph wire. Towards the end of the year, however, better co-operation had been secured from the Persian authorities in the prevention of thefts of wire, and there had been a decrease in the number of thefts.^ 37. Owing to the prevailing insecurity, the inefficiency of the Persian forces and the demand of the American Persian Gulf Command for a high degree of security, British troops have had to undertake increasing responsibility for the protection of supply routes to Russia and of installations important to the war effort. In the latter half of the year the practice of shooting at troops, particularly small patrols engaged in the protection of the railway, became a favourite sport with the Lur tribesmen. It is improbable that this had any political significance. The chance that an ambush might be successful and result in the capture of a rifle or some ammunition would be sufficient inducement. Hold-ups of isolated vehicles on the roads also took place. The number of casualties to Indian troops was about six. 38. During the typhus epidemic which visited Tehran in the spring the Persia and Iraq Command placed at the disposal of the Persian Government a 1,000-bed Indian hospital in tents, complete with doctors and orderlies. The hospital remained open from the 11th April to the 10th July and treated 2,036 patients. This gesture on the part of the Persia and Iraq Command created an excellent effect among the Persians and served as good propaganda. 39. During the autumn the Persian Government pointed out to His Majesty’s Legation that no procedure had yet been established for dealing with civil and criminal matters affecting Persians on the one hand and the British forces on the other, although article 4 (1) of the Anglo-Soviet-Persian Treaty of the 29th January, 1942, provided for the settlement, “ in co-operation with the [52—82]10 Iranian authorities,of all questions concerning relations between the latter and the Allied forces. As the Persian Government's contention appeared reasonable, His Majesty’s Legation communicated it to the Persia and Iraq Command, w ; ho expressed the view that the same arrangements for the judicial immunities for British troops should be made in Persia as in Iraq, so as to secure uniformity throughout the command as far as possible. The command then submitted a draft agreement on this basis, the text of which His Majesty’s Legation forwarded t^ the Foreign Office for instructions and to the United States Legation in Tehran for comment (since co-ordination with the United States authorities on this matter seemed desirable). That was the position at the end of the year. 40. In January the Soviet Ambassador in London complained that His Majesty’s Government had made important changes in the disposition of British troops in Persia without notifying the Soviet authorities. This, the ambassador asserted, was a breach of an undertaking, given by Mr. Eden in letters dated the 21st October and the 21st November, 1941, that the Soviet authorities should be consulted on such occasions. His Majesty’s Legation, commenting on M. Maisky’s complaint, pointed out that they had always informed the Soviet Military Attache in advance of all important moves of British forces in West Persia. They had not informed him of military movements in South or East Persia, but these had been confined to a few reconnaissances. The Soviet Embassy, however, had never reciprocated with information about movements of Soviet troops. Every facility had been given to Soviet authorities to visit the British zone, but here, too, the Soviet authorities did not grant reciprocal facilities. In April Mr. Eden wrote a letter to M. Maisky suggesting the following procedure : — The military attache to this legation should communicate to the Soviet Military Attache in Tehran, on condition that the latter reciprocated, advance information regarding minor changes in the disposition of British troops in Persia which did not involve a substantial change in their total number; on the other hand, major movements, involving a substantial change in the total number should be communicated in advance through ^ the diplomatic channel. The Soviet Government accepted these proposals. The Soviet Embassy in Tehran, however, have never given any information to His Majesty’s Legation regarding changes in the numbers or dispositions of their troops although there is reason to believe that such changes have taken place. 41. In the autumn the Persian Minister of Communications, while in London, complained that His Majesty’s Government were not consulting the Persian Government regarding the disposition of British troops in Persia, notwithstanding His Majesty’s Government’s undertaking to do so in the Anglo- Soviet-Persian Treaty of the 29th January, 1942. Elis Majesty’s Government decided that, in view of the changed strategical situation within the Persian and Iraq Command and of the representations made by the Persian Minister of Communications, information regarding the location of British troops in Persia should be forwarded to the Persian Government provided that the actual designation of formations and units was not divulged. Security Questions. 42. As in 1942 the rounding up of Germans and of Persian fifth columnists continued to exercise the closet attention of the legation in view of their danger to Allied security and interests in Persia, particularly on the vital lines of communications carrying aid to Russia. During the summer, owing to the serious deterioration in the general political situation and the dropping of German parachutists in various parts of Persia, it was decided to make use of certain information connected with the Axis plot of the previous year and to demand the arrest by the Persian Government of a few dangerous Persians. The Soviet and American Governments were kept fully informed of our intentions. It happened that at that time the Deputy Naubakht had tabled an interpellation in the Majlis attacking the Persian Government and the Allies. Therefore, as a first step, I provided the Prime Minister with full evidence about Naubakht’s treasonable activities to enable the Government to reply. I also asked for his parliamentary immunity to be withdrawn to facilitate his arrest by the Persian authorities. After interminable delays the Government failed to take any action and Naubakht fled to the Qashgai country without proceeding with his interpellation. Seyyid Abul Qasim Kashani, the anti-British mullah, went into hiding simultaneously. It then soon became clear that, if the Axis-controlled organisations were to bea** effectively dislocated, a much larger number of arrests than originally foreseen would have to be effected. Accordingly, having obtained the collaboration of the American authorities in the arrest of some railway employees and relying on the acquiescence of my American colleague, I handed to the Prime Minister on the 29th August a joint Anglo-Soviet list of 162 suspects with a request for their immediate arrest and detention and interrogation at Sultanabad. As well ^as the railway employees the list included Naubakht, Kashani and a number of ^Aenior army officers. On this occasion I was able to secure the support of the Soviet Charge d’Affaires, and the Prime Minister agreed, and by the end of the year about 138 had been arrested and handed over to us at Sultanabad. In October an additional list of ten suspects was handed to the Prime Minister for similar action, and the majority of these were arrested. This constitutes an example of the good effect of joint Anglo-Soviet representations to the Persian Government. As a matter of fact on the Anglo-Soviet list figured a certain number of suspects proposed by the Eussians against whom we had no evidence. In view of the embarrassing position in which we were placed the matter was taken up by the legation with the Soviet Embassy with the request that they should either take over their suspects or take part themselves in the interrogation at Sultanabad. Finally, after considerable delay and notwithstanding the apprehensions of the Persian Government, it was agreed that the suspects in question should be transferred to Eesht for examination, although the move had not taken place by the end of the year. 43. On the whole the position as regards Axis activities in Persia has been vastly improved during 1943 owing to the prompt manner in which the Persian Government reacted to the joint Anglo-Soviet representations referred to above. In addition, in dealing with suspects the Persian Government have had their hands strengthened by their declaration of war on Germany and adherence to the United Nations. Intact they have at last come down completely on the Allied side of the fence. The course of the war, too, has had a sobering effect on potential Axis agents. Even so we shall always be up against the venality and cowardice of the Persian authorities, and evidence of this is that well-known K suspects such as Naubakht, Vaziri and Kashani are still at large, whilst a few t German agents are known to be in hiding in the south. Active measures are, however, being taken by us to round up those concerned in spite of the very considerable difficulties involved. Anglo-Persian Public Relations. 44. The entry of Allied troops into Persia in 1941, while it resulted in the elimination of many nationals in the country, had done little to win over the Government and people from their deep-rooted admiration and friendship for everything German which had been so zealously and thoroughly fostered by the Nazi party during the latter years of Eeza Shah’s reign. It became apparent, therefore, that a publicity organisation of greater magnitude than the press attache’s office was essential to carry out British propaganda and to counteract the general feeling prevailing in the country that the Allies would be defeated. Accordingly in the early months of 1942 an office of the Ministry of Information was established at Tehran as the Public Relations Bureau of His Majesty s Legation. The new organisation was suitably located in the old centre of German propaganda, the “Brown House' at Tehran, and the activities of the bureau expanded rapidly. By the beginning of 1943 the first English newspaper in Persia, the Tehran Daily News, had made its appearance. A film unit had been set up to promote the showing of British news-reels and propaganda films, both through Persian commercial channels and by means of mobile cinema vans in the provinces. Steps had been taken to disseminate large quantities of reading material throughout the country, and a start had been made with the establishment of information centres in the provinces in conjunction with the various consulates. The field of broadcasting had also been entered and a daily half-hour broadcast in Persian organised from Radio Tehran. Visual publicity had been catered for by a special production unit in the bureau, which prepared pictorial material for display at the British Information Centre in Tehran and m the various consular reading rooms throughout the country. The office of the press attache had been incorporated in the new organisation and had set itself the uphill task of securing the co-operation of an unfriendly local press. 45. During the year under review these activities were further expanded and systematised. The Tehran Daily News, which had first appeared as a cyclostyled bulletin, was converted into a printed newspaper with a special supplement once a week. By the end of the year approximately 4,000 copies were being sold daily in Tehran and the provinces, and a substantial circle of [52—82] c 212 ^ permanent subscribers, totalling over 1,400, had been built up. This paper, in addition to providing reliable information about the course of the war, was also used considerably as a medium for publicising British activities such as those of the Anglo-Iranian Relief Fund and the Middle East Supply Centre. During the latter half of 1943 the attitude of the Persian press, which previously had on occasions been hostile in the extreme, underwent a welcome change for the better and many articles favourable to ourselves and our Allies were accepted by local editors for reproduction both in the Tehran and in the provincial papers. 46. In the course of the year considerable expansion took place in the publicity work centred on our consulates, and separate public relations units were brought into being at each consulate under the local supervision of His Britannic Majesty’s Consuls. In addition to arranging for the distribution of reading material of all kinds, several of these provincial posts undertook the publication of local news bulletins and the establishment of numerous reading rooms for the public in outlying areas where, besides facilities for reading, daily broadcasts of the British Broadcasting Corporation and other British radio services were made. 47. In the field of local publications a weekly news commentary in Persian, Tafsir, published by the press attache’s office, attained much popularity and 11,000 copies of each issue were regularly distributed to all classes of the people. With a view to influencing the younger generation of Persians a special fort nightly newspaper for schoolchildren was introduced in October and its popularity proved so great that the original circulation of 5,000 copies had to be raised to 17,000, all of which were disposed of by sales in schools. 48. Exhibitions and window displays depicting the Allied war effort and portraying the ordinary life and institutions of the British Commonwealth were arranged from time to time and a regular circuit of such displays was established for our consulates. 49. During the year the seven mobile cinema units of the bureau covered many thousands of miles and gave performances to audiences in outlying areas which had hitherto, in many cases, never seen a cinema. In Tehran a special newsreel cinema was built in a central part of the city and after a mediocre start succeeded in attracting considerable attention locally. 50. In order to meet the demands of the representatives of our many Allies in Tehran, a special section of the bureau was formed in October to carry out propaganda towards foreign nationals in the capital. As part of its duties it undertook the teaching of English to the various foreign communities, and by the end of the year over 500 Czechs and Poles were receiving regular instruction. 51. During the course of the year the favourable change in the fortunes of war altered fundamentally the basis of our propaganda in Persia and the need for special emphasis on the war largely diminished. Propaganda policy towards the end of the year was, therefore, directed more to supplying the people of the country with information of a general nature concerning all sides of British life. There is no doubt that a knowledge of how the average Briton lives and of how his civilisation has been established will go far towards laying the foundations of a better understanding between Britain and Persia, which is so essential to the two countries in the post-war period. British Council A ctivities. 52. The first member of the British Council teaching staff arrived in Tehran in January 1943 and an institute building was leased in February, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining the necessary staff and equipment the formal opening was delayed till June. The institute now has 650 members taking English lessons and 400 members who have joined for other activities. These include a lecture, film exhibition, concert and debate every week, a library and restaurant. The present building having proved too small, negotiations are now in progress for ! V ■ ' ~ * a much larger building to which all cultural and social activities will be transferred leaving the present building for teaching only. The permanent teaching staff of five is also teaching in the university, teachers’ training college, schools, technical college, national bank, railway school and elsewhere, the number of students in this category being over 2,000. The Agricultural College and Department of Mines have also asked for lessons. In a separate building lent by the Ministry of Education 700 adults are taught in evenings by British personnel who are employed during the day in the embassy, army, R.A.F. and other British organisations. This is obviously not altogether satisfactory, but no other teachers are available. The number now being taught English could be immediately trebled.13 53. An Anglo-Persian medical association, a dramatic society and an art club were formed and promise to develop successfully. 54. During the summer months of 1943 a separate institute was opened in the hills some miles above Tehran for younger people on vacation from the university and schools. A summer course was held in Tehran for those unable to leave the city. This will be repeated in 1944. 55. Books and periodicals have been presented to the libraries of the University, certain schools, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Parliament, to professional people of importance and also to the Shah. Books for sale to shops have been imported, but the demand far exceeds the supply Educational films with Persian commentary are being shown every day to different schools and faculties of the universities. A photographic exhibition of Britain open to the public was attended by 6,000 people. The council’s relationship with the Ministry of Education is excellent. The Minister has asked for British teachers in all secondary schools and professors for the university and has formally requested directors of institutes to inspect and submit to him reports on schools. The Minister of Commerce has asked for technical instructors for the technical colleges. 56. An institute was formally opened in Isfahan in December 1943 with a permanent British staff of three. There are 500 members taking English lessons and 200 have joined for other activities. As in Tehran the staff is teaching at the technical college and schools. Teaching could be extended to the staff of twelve factories which employ 25,000 operatives, to the large Armenian community in Julfa (a suburb of Isfahan), and to the 2,500 Polish children and adults who will remain there for the duration of the war, if sufficient staff were provided. 57. There is an urgent demand for institutes in other large towns of Persia. If permanent staff and sufficient funds to cover the considerable overhead expenses for institutes are not forthcoming, temporary staff for teaching should at least be provided. 58. At the end of the year the Russians were planning to open an institute in Tehran on the same basis as the Anglo-Persian institute. Internal A ffairs. (a) Majlis. 59. The 13th Majlis came to an end on the 23rd November. For many reasons less was heard than in the previous year about proposals for the limitation of its powers or its complete abolition. There seems to have been a general feeling that the powers of the Shah were tending to increase and ought to be held in check by the Majlis. Further, the Prime Minister had shown signs of using the Majlis as a smoke-screen to cover up his failure to pass distasteful legislation, whilst the Shah no doubt felt that the Majlis had its uses in curbing the power jof the Prime Minister. At any rate, the provisions of the Constitution as far as they affected the Majlis continued to be observed and a firman announcing the arrangements for elections for the 14th Legislature was duly published on the 23rd June. Up to the end of the year more than half the Deputies had been ^ 1 elected, although elections in Tehran and Tabriz had not been completed. In spite of Russian pressure, which resulted in the election of a few Communists, av U v voting was less of a farce than in the time of Reza Shah and, on the whole, the successful candidates did represent their constituencies. Governmental inter ference, irregularities and corrupt practices, being endemic in this country, could not be eliminated. 60. Legislation passed by the Majlis during 1943 included Bills for compulsory education, the establishment of a police training college, transfer of military personnel to the jurisdiction of civil courts, except in case of purely military offences, insurance for workers and various important measures sponsored by the Millspaugh Mission, which are referred to in other parts of this report. (b) Cabinets. 61. At the beginning of the year Qawam-es-Saltaneh was in power, but soon began to lose ground. His relations with the Shah had never been good. Both were determined to control the Ministry of War and the Shah was openly advocating social reform and the limitation of the power of the moneyed class, to which Qawam-es-Saltaneh belonged. Internal troubles in the Cabinet also embarrassed the Prime Minister. Seyyid Mehdi Farrukh, the Minister of Food,resigned and, after carrying on practically single-handed for some days, the Prime Minister presented a new Cabinet to the Majlis in the third week in January. It was composed as follows :— Minister without Portfolio : Ibrahim Hakimi. War : Marshal Amir Ahmedi. Education : Ali Akbar Siassi. Industry and Commerce : Abdul Hussein Hajhir. ^ Agriculture : Ahmed Adle. Food : Mehdi Farrukh. Foreign Affairs : Mohammed Saed. Justice : Jawad Amery. Finance : Allahyar Saleh. Interior; Farajullah Bahramy. Posts and Telegraphs : Muhsin Rais. Roads : Hi Motamedy. Health : Nasrullah tntizam. The last three were the Shah's nominees and were relatively young men, without previous Cabinet experience. Early in February the Cabinet showed signs of disintegrating owing to internal dissension and the Prime Minister’s treatment of the press, but he managed to obtain a vote of confidence by a small majority. His position vis-a-vis the Majlis was becoming hopeless. In a desperate attempt to appease the Deputies he tabled Bills (a) to abrogate the fundamental law that no Deputy might become a Cabinet Minister, and (b) to give to the Majlis powers over the appointment of the head of the National Bank. These measures merely gave rise to acrimonious comment, and when the Shah’s sympathies were alienated by the Prime Minister's declaration that, in order to establish the authority of the people, the Constitution should be revised, and by his legitimate attempt to curb the Shah’s control of the army and the General Staff, it became evident that the game was up and Qawam-es-Saltaneh resigned. 62. Soheily was the next Prime Minister, and on the 21st February the following Cabinet received a unanimous vote of confidence from the Majlis :— Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior : Ali Soheily. Commerce and Industry : Mahmoud Bader. War : Marshal Amir Ahmedi. Communications : Abdul Hussein Hajhir. Justice : Ali Asghar Hikmat. Foreign Affairs : Mohammed Saed. Finance : Allahyar Saleh. Education : Ali Akbar Siassi. Posts and Telegraphs : Nasrullah Intizam. Health : Amanullah Ardelan. Ministers without Portfolio : Mohammed Tadayyun and Hussein SarniJ. 63. Such a team seemed the best available in the circumstances, with the possible exception of the Prime Minister. The programme of the Cabinet included the supply of food, the stabilisation of prices, the improvement of the welfare of the peasants, the workers and Government employees, and co-operation with the Allies. Tadayyun, an experienced Majlis debater, was appointed Minister of Food in March, and Ettebar, a Majlis Deputy, became Minister of Agriculture a fortnight later. The Prime Minister managed to curb the excesses of the press, largely as a result of representations from this legation. The offences for which newspapers might be suppressed were also re-defined and eleven organs of the press were actually suppressed. The Bill defining Dr. Millspaugh’s powers was proceeded with in spite of agitation against it, as expressed by the closing of the bazaars. However, the whole effect of this show of firmness was ruined by the Prime Minister declaring in secret session that such action had been forced on him by the British. 64. As a result of a dispute between the Minister of Finance and the American advisers, the former resigned and was replaced at the end of April by an elderly Majlis Deputy, Murteza Quli Bayat, The Government survived with a large majority an interpellation in the Majlis in May challenging the legality of the appointment of the Majlis Deputies, Ettebar and Bayat as Ministers, as well as the right of the Government to transfer their authority under the Military Governor Law to the Minister of War and to interpret in their own way a section of that law. The Government victory was alleged to be due to the fact that there was no obvious successor to Soheily. Strikes of engineers and professors,jjy m 'W^ r ' - ! '' 15 the rise of the Tudeh party and the refusal of Marshal Ahmedi to continue acting as Military Governor of Tehran still further complicated Soheily s problems in May. Dr. MillspauglTs regulations for the stabilisation of prices, his Income Tax Bill and his retrenchment in Government expenditure were of course unpalatable. The introduction of a Bill for the limitation of the number of newspapers in Tehran and the establishment of a press censorship proved Unpopular and resulted in the resignation in June of the Minister of Justice and the Director of the Department of Press and Propaganda. 65. At the beginning of July Hussein Sami‘i took over the Ministry of the Interior, and Khalil Fahimy filled the vacated post of Minister without Portfolio. Disorder and insecurity consequent upon the disaster at Semirum in July seemed likely to create an ugly situation throughout the country, particularly in the tribal areas. How the Government dealt with that problem is told in the section on the Tribal Situation. The vacant post of Minister of Justice was given to the elderly reactionary, Muhsin Sadr, early in August. At the end of August Siassi resigned owing to a difference of opinion with Soheily. Hussein Sami‘i found the Ministry of the Interior too exacting for him and resigned early in September, and was replaced by ladayyun. The latter had the invidious and unpleasant duty of administering the elections throughout the country, and carried out his duties with firmness and courage, though the inevitable accusations of bribe-taking and corruption were made against him, usually from disappointed candidates. 66. The complicated disputes between the General Staff and the Ministry of War concerning their spheres and relative positions proved a great embarrass ment to Soheily. Dr. Millspaugh also became restive at the procrastination of the Majlis in connexion with the passing of the Income Tax Bill, and threatened to resign. To make matters worse for Soheily about thirty of the Deputies, who had found that they had no chance of re-election to the 14th Majlis, began to intrigue against the Prime Minister in every possible way. An interpellation concerning' the nation 5 s bread supplies was taken on the 31st October, and resulted in a vote of confidence for Soheily. Eventually, in November, the Income Tax and other essential measures became law. 67. Throughout the last three months of the year Soheily had to deal with the threat to his position caused by the return to Persia, at the beginning of October, of Seyyid Zia-ud-Din Tabatabai after 22 years’ absence in exile, latterly in Palestine. ' The Prime Minister profited from, and probably abetted, the campaign against the Seyyid, which was instigated by the Russians and by the Shah and it was not owing to Seyyid Zia but to the Shah that Soheily had to resign in the middle of December. It soon became apparent that the Shah’s chief interest was to eliminate from the Cabinet the only two strong men therein . Tadayyun at the Ministry of the Interior and Marshal Amir Ahmedi at the Ministry of War. Soheily was called upon to form a new Cabinet without them, and on the 16th December the following Cabinet was appointed Prime Minister : Ali Soheily. Foreign Affairs : Muhammad Saed. Justice : Muhsin Sadr. Finance : Amanullah Ardelan. Interior : Abdul Hussein Hajhir. Roads : Nasrullah Intizam. Agriculture : Moosa Noury Esfandiary. Education : Issa Sadiq. Posts and Telegraphs : Hamid Sayyah. War : Ibrahim Zand. Public Health : Qasim Ghani. Commerce and Industry : General Shafai. Without Portfolio: Mustafa Adle. Of these Zand, Shafai, Intizam and Noury Esfandiary were nominees of the Shah, and it was generally thought that this was the Shah’s first step in the experiment of governing the country through a subservient Cabinet, as his father had done. Zand was the first civilian to be Minister of War for a long time, and the general opinion was that the Shah was determined to become commandei- in-ohief of the army in fact as well as in name and to circumvent the weak- civilian Minister by issuing orders through his Chief of Staff, m spite of the decree he had signed in the spring making the General Staff subordinate to the Ministry of War.7 4C Tribal Situation.' 68. The weakness of the Government, its lack of any consistent policy and the ineffectiveness of its forces have been responsible for its failure to re-establish control in large areas of tribal country. An uneasy peace has been secured by a policy of giving way to tribal leaders and by avoiding undue interference in tribal affairs. But this policy, by strengthening the influence of the tribal leaders^, must inevitably increase the difficulties of the eventual establishment o Government authority, which must be preceded by disarmament. For the time being the stronger tribes have little to complain of from the oppression of Government officials; they have benefited by the high prices prevailing for grain, mutton and wool; they escape conscription to a large extent; and if they do not always pillage the peaceful villager they usually levy tribute in some form or another. On the other hand they can justly complain of almost total neglect by the Government in the matter or provision of medical and educational facilities and of tea, sugar and cloth. 69. In Ears the situation is particularly unsatisfactory. After the demoralising defeat inflicted on the Persian army at Semirum (see section on Persian Land Forces), the Persian Government realised that they could rely neither on their commanders nor on their troops to compel the submission of Nasir and the Qashgai tribes. Frightened at the prospect, they called on Qavam-ul-Mulk to raise the Khamseh tribes, who had formerly been under his and his family’s leadership, in support of the Government. But, hardly had they made this decision, when they wavered in the face of the criticisms of Nasir s supporters in Tehran and of the champions of peace at any price, and, taking the immediately easier way, they approved a policy of conciliation of Nasir and his brother Khosrow and the tacit recognition of. their leadership of the Qashgai tribes. They made certain conditions, which have, of course, not been fulfilled. Nasir was to surrender the arms which had been taken at various times from Government forces and to hand over certain Germans wlho were known to be in Qashgai territory. At the end of the year the situation was that Nasir and Khosrow had greatly increased their influence in Fars; the Government being unable to give any protection to property situated in areas dominated by the Qashgai tribes, landowners were forced to accept Nasir’s terms; Nasir has been steadily acquiring wealth by the sale of grain on the black market and by levying tribute on villages and landowners; German agents are still at large, if not always in Qashgai territory yet still under Qashgai protection; and the Persian army appears to be no nearer the day when it can deal with Nasir by force. But there is no serious disturbance, and provided that Nasir is allowed to continue to have his own way it will be to his interest to show that he can restrain the lawlessness of his tribes within moderate bounds. 70. He seeks to extend his influence to Kuh-i-Galu, and especially to the Boir Ahmadi, of whom certain sections played the principal part in the attack on the Persian troops at Semirum. But the rebel Boir Ahmadi leader, Abdullah Zarghampur, has little reason to trust the Qashgai and is well occupied with dissensions in his own tribe and rivals in Kuh-i-Galu. These dissensions led to some unrest on the borders of the oil-fields from Masjid-i-Suleiman to Gach Saran, but, except for an occasional hold-up of road traffic and a raid on the pumping station at Do Gumbadan, where the raiders contented themselves with looting the houses of some employees, there has been no direct interference with the oil company’s interests. Any deliberate attack by a responsible chief is unlikely, but while Germans are present with the tribes the possibilities of sabotage must be guarded against. 71. In Bakhtiari also the old ruling family has got back to power. Again because of the weakness of their forces and the inefficiency and corruption of their officials, the Persian Government were obliged to depart from their avowed policy of preventing the return to positions of authority in their own country of important tribal chiefs and to call on Morteza Quli, son of the late Samsam-es- Sultaneh, to accept the governorship of Bakhtiari. He is the most respectable and influential of the Bakhtiari Khans and the least likely to indulge in adven tures harmful to the Government. In the short view his appointment has been an undoubted success. Bakhtiari is more settled and peaceful than for many months past. The rebel Khan Abul Qasim, seeing that Morteza Quli’s influence was ousting his own, decided to submit, and he is now living in Tehran. There are inevitably the usual family feuds and jealousies inseparable from any Bakhtiari rule, but it is to be hoped that Morteza Quli’s sense and influence will prevent their leading to disturbance. Bakhtiari is relatively peaceful, but it is to a large extent an autonomous tribal entity.17 [52—82] D 72. Some of the Arab tribes of Khuzestan were persuaded by a show of force in the summer to surrender about 1,000 rifles. This represents only a small proportion of what they have, but they were relieved of further persuasion by an outbreak of the Janeki tribe which required the whole attention of the available Persian forces. Since then they have been left in relative peace. They still possess a large number of arms and they have been guilty of much robbery with y*ndolence. Large numbers of them are employed at good wages by the Allied military forces and they should benefit by schemes of agricultural development now being planned by Colonel Noel. 73. The Lurs have shown little unity; inter-faction jealousies are much alive. It is doubtful even whether they would combine effectively against an attempt by the Government to disarm them, as there are no chiefs of outstanding influence/ Meanwhile, if reports are true, they are purchasing considerable numbers of rifles from Iraq to be used against each other or in certain eventualities against the Government. 74. The Kurds of Northern Kurdestan have been disappointed to find the Soviet authorities less sympathetic—indeed, supporting the Persian authorities against the Kurds and showing clear disapproval of Kurdish raids across the Turkish frontier. They have consequently been behaving with discretion m the neighbourhood of Russian troops and have restricted their pillaging of villages to the more distant areas. In Southern Kurdestan the tribes are to a large extent being left alone to run their own affairs. There are the usual mter-faction squabbles and disputes over land, but the influence of local British officials has prevented these from developing into serious disturbances. I he Kurdish tribes of Persia continue to demonstrate their inability to co-operate or to show a united front. Persian Land Forces. (a) Army. 75. Regrettably little progress has been made in the reform of the Persian army. The causes are many, but they can all be traced to the absence of an accepted policy or of any clear direction. The Shah continues to hankei after absolute personal command unhampered by parliamentary criticism or financial considerations and to insist that Persia must have an army at least equal to Turkey’s. On the one hand, fear of public and parliamentary criticism, added to his own defects of character, do not allow him to exercise effective command, and, on the other, his jealousy and suspicion lead him to oppose the exeicise of authority by the Minister for War or Chief of Staff. Stalin s offer of airciaft and large tanks and his alleged advice that Persia needed a strong army for the defence of the dynasty and of the country’s independence'have made him more than ever unwilling to accept schemes of reorganisation drawn up to suit the limited financial provision which Dr. Millspaugh is prepared to make, still less inclined to authorise and support their execution. The situation is further 1 complicated by widespread corruption and by dissensions in the army which, it is feared, are encouraged by the Russians in their opposition to the increase of the influence of the American advisers. 76. General Ridley’s mission now consists of eleven officers with nine more on demand from America. The full number requested by the Persian Govern ment is thirty. Regulations have been issued governing the responsibilities and functions of the American advisory mission. They are confined to administra tion and insufficient authority has been given to the American officers to make their control really effective. The difficulties before them, which are formidable in any case, are increased bv their lack of experience of any similar problem and by their ignorance of the' country and the language. Since their plans are designed to improve administration, and since that entails a check on long standing habits of embezzlement, they are meeting with much opposition and progress is very slow. The arrival of 600 lorries from America has enabled them to begin the organisation of much-needed transport services, and they are woi king hard to bring some order into the medical, supply and finance serv ices of the army. The American advisers appear to be leaving the development of the Persian c air force to the Royal Air Force. ™ • * * c. 77. Some attempt has been made by the present Chief of Staff to discourage corruption. A number of senior officers have been placed on the retired list, but while military tribunals continue to acquit with monotonous regularity, even in flagrant cases, and the Shah to intervene to protect his favourites and their favourites, no great change of heart can be expected. The application of consrip-18 c tion continues to be one of the most scandalous abuses m the country t e . &lt; exemptions being a steady source of profit to the police, the gendarmerie and medical and military officials connected with the calling up of recruits. result is that the army gets only the poorest men. . , 78 The only serious operation ventured on during the year was that can led out by General Shahbakhti in May and June in an attempt to secure the sub _ mission of Nasir Qashgai. After weeks of procrastination an ^ ltial scored by the driving of Nasir Qashgai from his stronghold at Firuzabad. This, however, was not followed up, and the tribes retaliated by inflicting on the Persian garrison of Semirum, in the Qashgai summer quarters a serious defeat which resulted in the capture of all the arms and equipment of the force of some 800 men. Some minor operations were carried out m different parts oi e country, nominally for the collection of arms, but there is no reason to behe\ e that any of' them was more than partially effective. , p ^ • 79. At the end of the year the nominal strength of tlie ^ as 80 000 but it is doubtful whether its real numbers exceeded 70,000 It remains widely dispersed over the countrv organised nominally into ten so-called divisions, two of which are at Tehran, the spirit of the officers remains very poor : the better ones are disheartened and discontented ; the others make as much profit as they can. (b) Gendarmerie. 80. Although American advisers have been at work in the gendarmerie foi over a year no considerable improvement is yet visible, nor is any real improve- ment possible until the gendarme is paid a living wage. His present wage is far below that standard. Colonel Schwarzkopf has recently been given fairly extensive executive powers, and, as he has energy, determination and much optimism, it is hoped that he will soon be able to show results His schemes are perhaps too ambitious. He aims at creating a force which will be entirely independent of the army in all respects, with its own services and equipped to carrv out minor operations. As the role of the army in present circumstances is nothing more than the restoration of internal security, it seems that a dose co-operation between the two forces and a pooling of certain resources would lead to econom^and efficmncy^^ ^ the gen( jarmerie at the end of the year was 937 officers and 22.303 men. Its actual strength was probably considerably less. Persian A ir Force. 82 The strength of the Imperial Air Force on the 31st December, 1943, after deduction of 53 officers and 196 non-commissioned officers awaiting transfer or discharge, was 225 officers, 433 non-commissioned officers and 596 conscripted men the flying personnel being 52 officers and 60 sergeant pilots and 64 officer observers This is a reduction of more than one-third from the strength of a year before and reflects a wholesome attempt at reorganisation on realistic lines. 1 he strength in aircraft was 189, of which 101 were Hart Variants and 78 tiger Moths. No new aircraft were brought into service during the year, the morale, discipline and training of the force remain poor, but there are signs ol improve ment in all of them. This is due partly to the efforts of the present head of the air force General Mohammed Hussein Firouz, and largely to the encouragement given by His Majesty’s Government in the promised supply of fifteen new Anson aircraft and the assistance and advice of technical officers of the Royal Air Force. The return to the Imperial Air Force of certain buildings at Doshan Tappeh and the completion of the hangars at Isfahan should help to improve the standard of maintenance of aircraft. 1 In this respect better organisation and a proper stores procedure should also in time show good results. A drastic reform of the head quarters organisation is in progress. It will, nevertheless, be some time before the force can hope to have any serious operational value. 83. Relations between the Persian Air Force and the Royal Air Force are good. Finance. (a) General. 84. Our financial relations with Persia in 1943 were more amicable than they had been during the previous year, principally because the vexed question of the supply of currency for the Allied war effort in Persia seemed at last to have been settled. But, although relations had improved, the financial situation had19 [52—82] D 2 not. Several crises arose during the year which threatened to wreck the whole financial and economic structure of the country, and in turn the entire machinery \of government. Only by a very narrow margin was this avoided, but the elements which were responsible for the crises still exist, and Persia’s financial future remains at best unsatisfactory and at worst precarious. 85. When, in 1942, the Persian Government saw their country sliding into /“'financial and economic chaos, chiefly because of their own reluctance or inability to adopt and enforce the measures which have been universally accepted as essential to combat war-time inflation, they decided to invite Dr. A. C. Millspaugh —an American who had headed a financial mission to Persia in the years immediately following the last war—to undertake the guidance of their country s finances in the difficult time that lay ahead. Pie arrived in February 1943, with a small staff of assistants, to take up this thankless task in the face of a covertly hostile Majlis which, in the months which were to follow, obstructed by all the means in its power every item of legislation which he proposed in order to combat inflation and restore the country’s economic equilibrium. The reason for this was not far to seek. The Deputies of the Majlis were themselves the very people who would profit by a continuation of the existing state of affairs, i.e., landowners, merchants, contractors, &amp;c. They wasted days in futile debates, and used every artifice of oriental politics to delay and emasculate essential legislation, either for their own selfish ends or for those vested interests of which they were the willing tools. Eventually, at the beginning of November, Dr. Millspaugh's patience ran out, and he delivered an ultimatum that he and the members of his mission would resign if the Majlis failed to pass within a week the Income Tax Bill and a Bill authorising the engagement of a total of sixty Americans, inclusive of his then staff of ten or twelve. The Deputies, realising that the game was up, capitulated and passed the two Bills. At the same time, they hastened to proclaim that it was their devotion to their country’s interests that had com pelled them to subject these Bills to such close scrutiny. And that’s the wavering Majlis; for their love Lies in their purses; and whoso empties them, By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate. (b) Price Control. 86. Dr. Millspaugh asked the Majlis for special powers to control prices, regulate imports and exports, fix rents, and control wages on all public works and in public services. This authority was eventually granted on the 4th May, 1943, under a law entitled the “ Millspaugh Special Powers Law,” which enabled him to issue regulations from time to time designed to carry these measures into effect. Chief among these regulations was one establishing a new Department of the Ministry of Finance, called the Price Stabilisation Section, with a subsidiary organisation in the provinces. 87. Armed with these wide powers, Dr. Millspaugh proceeded to issue regulations aimed at checking hoarding, stabilising rents and regulating prices of essential commodities. As often as not active campaigns of protest followed upon their publication, and in some cases he had to bow before the storm and issue amendments to conciliate the opposition elements. Not only had Dr. Millspaugh these obstructions to contend with, but he found himself obliged to work through a bureaucracy lacking any serious experience of administration of measures of this kind and, as well, unbelievably corrupt and demoralised. It is therefore remarkable that, in spite of all these handicaps, Dr. Millspaugh has been able at least to keep in check to some extent the soaring prices which have given Persia the unenviable reputation of being probably the only country in the world, with the exception of China, where war-time inflation has been allowed, with the connivance of the ruling oligarchy, to run rampant. (c) Financial Crisis. 88. By April it seemed that the financial volcano was at last about to erupt. The main cause of the new crisis was the Government’s unhealthy budgetary situation. Dr. Millspaugh estimated that, in excess of ordinary taxation revenue, at least another 1,500 million rials would be needed to balance the country’s budget. He could rely upon internal borrowing only to the extent of 500 million rials, to be obtained from the National Bank, and he suggested that the Allies should grant an emergency loan to cover the remainder of his apprehended deficit. In the event, he has been able to carry on up to December 1943 without recourse to foreign loans, though he had, in fact, applied to the State Department for a loan20 r of $30 million (subsequently increased to $50 million). He did, however, obtain an advance of £4 million from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company against future payments of oil royalties, and this has been used to finance the ordinary expenses of Government. 89. As the year progressed, and anti-inflationary legislation was slowly forced through a reluctant Majlis, Dr. Millspaugh began to take a more optimistic view of the Government’s financial position. Revenue returns exceeded hit^v expectations, and it was this, combined with his reluctance to put before the Majlis another major controversial measure, that induced him to postpone his request for a foreign loan. It is interesting to note the Persian Prime Minister’s reaction (and presumably that of the Majlis) to the loan project. It can be summarised as follows :— Purely American loan : acceptable. British participation : unwelcome, but acceptable if unavoidable. Russian participation : entirely unacceptable. And that, perhaps, sums up the degrees of confidence which the Allies enjoy among well-informed Persians. (d) Inflation. 90. The trend of inflation throughout the year can best be gauged by a study of the cost-of-living and wholesale price indices. While in January 1943 the cost-of-living index was 614 and wholesale price index 554, by December 1943 they had risen to 1076 and 665 respectively. (The heavy comparative rise in the cost-of-living index figure is an indication of the extent to which retailers are amassing profits.) The internal price level in this country at the end of the year was therefore probably higher than in any other territory in the Middle East. In the closing months of 1943, however, wholesale prices eased, although the relief had not begun to be felt in the retail market. To some extent this tendency could be attributed to the growing belief that the end of the war was not far off, which caused hoarders of consumer goods to begin to unload; at the same time an improvement in the transport situation facilitated the arrival in the interior of stocks of goods that had lain for months in the Gulf ports; this also added to the anxiety of hoarders and contributed to the weakening of black market prices. 91. The scarcely concealed activities of hoarders and speculators also greatly hampered Dr. Millspaugh’s efforts at price stabilisation, and it was not until late in the year that there was some tightening up in the enforcement of these regulations, more particularly against hoarders, some of whom were sent to prison. The primary cause of inflation in Persia, of course, was still the uncontrolled pressure of a constantly increasing amount of internal purchasing power upon a static or diminishing supply of consumer goods. (e) The Income Taoc Bill. 92. Of all Dr. Millspaugh’s anti-inflationary measures placed before the Majlis, the Income Tax Bill was the most unpalatable, as it directly affected all the Deputies, and created the crisis which almost led to his departure. The Bill hung in the Financial Commission for many weeks, and went through a process of emasculation which destroyed much of its original purpose. Finally, during the first week of November, it came before the Deputies in full session for enactment. Amendment after amendment was proposed—all directed towards relieving the pockets of the rich from the incidence of income tax. It was obviously the intention of the Deputies to pigeon-hole this unpopular measure for at least the remainder of their term of office, which had almost expired. Dr. Millspaugh thereupon decided to let it be known that unless the Bill was passed in its entirety, except for reasonable amendments, he was not going to remain. On hearing of this the Shah promptly intervened, indicating that it was his wish that the Bill, and the Bill to engage more Americans, should be enacted without delay. So, on the 11th November, the Majlis capitulated, and the Bill was passed. In its final form, the Bill represented a substantial compromise on Dr. Millspaugh’s original proposals, but no amendment was incorporated which seriously jeopardised its principles though the postponement of its application for a year deprived the country of much-needed revenue. (f) The Budget Law. 93. Another major item of legislation which the Majlis passed in November was the Budget Law for the financial year from March 1943 to March 1944. As presented, the Bill was divided into two parts—the Ordinary Budget, which■H 21 showed a deficit of about 1,400 million rials, and the Extraordinary Budget (covering the industrial and trading operations of the Government), which was self-balancing. Although Dr. Millspaugh had indicated that the only way he could see of balancing the Ordinary Budget was by borrowing from the Allies, the Deputies, in their patriotic zeal, preferred to produce a balanced budget by including as an item of revenue the value of stocks of commodities held by ^^iie various Government trading organisations at the beginning of the financial year, rather than consent to a foreign loan. (g) Sale of Gold. 94. By no means the least important weapon employed in the fight against inflation in Persia was the sale by His Majesty’s Government of gold in the open market, in order to withdraw the excess purchasing power from the people to some extent. In the initial stages of the scheme, which was begun in June 1943, the proceeds of the sales of gold were allocated to the British military authorities in Persia, to defray in part their local expenditure, but later, when the United States authorities also began to interest themselves in what seemed a profitable plan for financing the cost of the war, an arrangement was concluded between London and Washington whereby the whole of the local currency proceeds derived from sales in Persia were placed at the disposal of the American authorities with effect from 25th September, 1943. (h) Note Circulation. 95. In January 1943, the value of notes in circulation was Rials 3,193-24 millions compared with 935-93 millions on the outbreak of war. By December 1943, notes in circulation had risen to 6,150-75 millions, an increase during the year of 2,957-51, or almost 100 per cent. 96. The supply of currency notes during the year occasionally gave cause for anxiety, but there were no acute shortages such as were experienced in 1942. At one stage early in the year, however, the currency authorities threatened to issue no more notes against sterling until we delivered the gold due to Persia under the Financial Agreement. The position we had adopted was that we would hand over the gold when the Majlis ratified the agreement. As it happened, the threat was never carried into effect, and the agreement was ratified in June. (i) Sale of Silver to India. 97. When the National Bank of Iran decided, as a matter of policy, to replace the silver in the Currency Reserve by gold which the Government was purchasing from the United States authorities, the Government of India were asked if they wished to buy a quantity of 500 tons which was available for sale in the open market. Of this amount the bank ofiered to sell 120 tons at Rupees 80 per 100 tolas 916 fine—the approximate price at which the Government of India had sold a similar amount to the Persian Government in 1942—and the remainder at the current Tehran price. The offer was accepted, and at the end of the year arrangements were being made to pack and ship the silver to India. Altogether the quantity of silver in the Currency Reserve amounted to 1,600 tons and &amp; the National Bank hope to be able to sell the whole amount to the Government of India. If this can be done, the Persian Government will not only stand to make a substantial profit (the silver stands in the Currency Reserve at the international market price), but under the Financial Agreement the rupees paid by the Government of India will qualify for convertibility as to 60 per cent, into gold. On the other hand, the Government of India are buying the silver at a price well below that ruling in Bombay. Civil Supplies and Transport. 98. The new import licensing system introduced in the latter part of 1942 at the request of the Middle East Supply Centre to restrict imports to essential commodities was functioning by the beginning of the year. Of the total import quota for the period January-June of 71,000 tons, licences were issued for 59,000 tons, the difference being due to a reduction in the originally planned imports of sugar owing to the discovery of adequate stocks in the country. Persia’s need for imported goods was considered with sympathy at the Imports I Conference held in May by the Middle East Supply Centre in Cairo, when more motor vehicles, heavy chemicals and cotton piece-goods than originally planned were allocated. In May also agreement was reached between the British, Americans and Persians as to the method of satisfying Persian requirements of drugs, a subject that had given rise to misundertanding between the British andthe Americans on account of our respective post-war interests in the Persian market for these products. , ^ . i 99. The Middle East Supply Centre, Tehran, moved out of the Britisn Legation in May and set up in separate offices as an Anglo-American )o y. The staff nevertheless continued to be entirely British, for repeated efforts on our part to find Americans to share the work (and the odium) and to tacilita e co-operation with the American advisers and the Lease-Lend organisation me^ with no success, and American participation was limited to attendance at committees and to the provision of an American room, which is usually empty, m the Middle East Supply Centre building. In the middle of the year Dr. Millspaugh’s Price Stabilisation Section, as part of its attack on high prices, issued a number of regulations concerning imports which tended temporal i y to discourage merchants and caused a diminution of activity ; but many ot restrictions were later withdrawn and merchants’ imports of the goods that hac not remained Government monopolies (e.g., cereals, sugar, tea and cotton piece- goods) filled the available quotas. Co-operation between the Middle East Supply Centre and the Millspaugh Mission, though tenuous at first, grew steadily, thanks mainly to the initiative of the former, into a very close and constant collaboration. . . , . , 100. In the autumn clear signs of potential crisis during the winter appeared, but energetic action all round has removed our worst fears. Owing to low rates and poor control Government transport had become seriously disorganised and the ability of the Road Transport Department to meet many vital demands arising concurrently was seriously reduced, although at that time the Government owned 900 recently arrived Lend-Lease trucks and had under contract (on paper) about 1,000 other vehicles. Cereals collection and the distribution of other essential goods were very seriously threatened by tins prevailing lack of transport. Furthermore, the Government monopolies of sugar, tea, cotton piece-goods and drugs were not operating, and in fact had resulted merely in substantial stocks of these goods not readhing the public. On top oi all this came the threat by Dr. Millspaugh and his entire mission to resign Happily this was withdrawn in time for the mission to co-operate with the Anglo American supply authorities in removing the worst features of the threatened civil-supply crisis The Persia and Iraq Command and the Middle East b&gt;upp y Centre came to the rescue. The British army undertook to carry cereals for Tehran from the west and oil from Kermanshah to Tabriz and from Shahrood to Meshed; and arrangements were made for the seconding of Middle hast Supply Centre officers to Persia to supervise cereals collection and civil road transport. . . . , ^ , .,i 101. The year closed with the economic situation much steadier and with prices showing a tendency to fall. The new Government formed in December indicated a desire to work closely in economic matters with the British and \merican Legations and the Middle East Supply Centre; the new Minister of Commerce, Industry and Mines, General Shafai, even paid public tribute to the help given in the past to Persian industry and trade by His Majesty’s Legation and certain Middle East Supply Centre officers. . ^ , 102 With the end of the war in sight many Tehran merchants began thinking of re-establishing connexions with United Kingdom firms; and the number of enquiries received by the Commercial Secretariat on this point increased. Industry. 103 Early in the vear an Industrial Development Committee was set up under the segis of the Middle East Supply Centre, with Persian, British and American participation. Its object was to promote local industry in order to economise imports. This body was able to give substantial help to Persian factories and it was mainly thanks to its efforts that the sugar-beet crop was harvested and local sugar production maintained. Lack of transport hampered industry throughout the year. Latterly, signs of labour unrest increased, but direct Russian encouragement, though widely suspected, could not be proved. Agriculture. 104 In the earlv spring the Persian Government asked the Allies for help to provide seed for spring sowing. As a result, arrangements were made to import •2 000 tons of sorghum (a variety of millet) from Iraq and an Anglo-Americam Persian committee was set up to supervise distribution. Thanks to the work of this committee a large part of the imported seed was sown, but the results,23 unfortunately, were not good owing (it is alleged) to the quality of the seed having been poor. The Khuzistan Agricultural Society, under the management of Lieutenant-Colonel E. W. C. Noel, D.S.O., C.I.E., continued its activity, but will not be extended because the soil in that area has proved to be unsuitable. Irrigation schemes in tihe vicinity are, however, being proceeded with under Lieutenant-Colonel Noel’s direction and with the support of the Persian ,/^epartment of Irrigation. Grain Collection. 105. Our efforts to assist the country as a whole to feed itself, so as to be independent as far as possible of supplies from abroad, continued throughout the year. Thanks to this, to arrivals of wheat from North America and adulterants from Iraq, and of wheat from Russia, the country reached the 1943 harvest without widespread famine, though there were undoubtedly many deaths from starvation in various places, including Tehran, and the free market price ]rose in some places to £80 a ton. The small band of British Consular Liaison Officers worked untiringly; without their help the situation would have been much worse. The central control of grain collection was transferred from Mr. Sheridan, who resigned in August, to Mr. Crawford, another American. Mr. Crawford was without experience of such work, but he is less spasmodic than Mr. Sheridan and he welcomed from the start the assistance of British officials of whose value it took Mr. Sheridan some time to be convinced. Towards the end of the year the control of the Consular Liaison Officers, which had hitherto been vested in His Majesty’s Legation, was transferred to the Middle East Supply Centre, who also interested themselves in the question of additional help of Dr. Millspaugh. As Americans to fill the Millspaugh cadre of sixty were coming in very slowly it was agreed between the Americans and the British concerned that the British authorities should lend for work in Persia a con siderable number of officers and men who had had experience in grain collection and road transport control in Syria, and that in March 1944 the situation should be reviewed to decide whether this help was still needed or not. 106. The difference between the British attitude and the Russian has been touched upon in the section on “ Soviet Interests.” The north, though the main granary of Persia, contributed little towards the feeding of the deficit areas during the 1942-43 harvest, and against the histrionic gift of 25,000 tons of wheat from Russia must be set the large quantities of grain, especially rice but including several thousand tons of wheat and more of barley, which the Soviet authorities consumed in the country or exported from it. The bumper harvest which was secured all over the country in 1943 raised the hope that this time the north would contribute its quota for the common good. Every reference to this subject in conversation with the Russians was met with the enquiry what Hamadan and Kermanshah were doing. In fact, not only did these two districts, which always export wheat, do well, but even in Shiraz, which is normally a deficit area, the British Consular Liaison Officer made contracts for a quantity of grain exceeding local consumption. The large quantities of wheat which, thanks to the energy of British Consular Liaison Officers, were collected in Hamadan and Kermanshah might, however, have been useless to the capital at its time of greatest need if the British military authorities had not carried grain from these two places to railhead at Sultanabad with military transport. Bv the end of the year the quantity carried had exceeded 10,000 tons and the lift was continuing. The Prime Minister, stimulated by Dr. Millspaugh and the British Legation, approached the Soviet Embassy about grain supplies from the north, whence Dr. Millspaugh had hoped to obtain 50,000 tons towards feeding the deficit areas and building up a reserve. The Russians admitted 40,000 tons as a fair quota from the north, and offered to help with the carriage from the main centres—provided that adequate road transport was provided for local hauls. Considerable numbers of lorries were sent up to Meshed and Tabriz, but by the end of the year the quantity of grain received by Tehran from Khorassan was small, and from Azerbaijan, nil. 107 On the other hand, the position in the central and southern regions of Persia is vastly different. Out of a target of 170,000 tons up to the harvest of 1944, 149,360 tons had actually been collected by the end of the year and o-rain was still coming in satisfactorily. Provided that 20,000 tons only out of the 40,000 tons hoped for from the northern areas are actually received in Tehran, it seems likely that grain supplies will be sufficient to last till next harvest'without the necessity to import from abroad. If this result is achieved, it will be because, whereas the north has served the State very ill, the south has24 made an unpreeedently high contribution—thanks to the assistance ahorded y British consular officers and British Consular Liaison Officers whose local I knowledge, energy and powers of persuasion have been invaluable. Locust Control. 108. Since 1943 was the third year of the current migratory cycle of the Desert Locust and a serious influx of swarms into Persia was expected, tbji. British, Soviet and Indian Governments lent every possible assistance to til Persian Government, with a view to obviating emergency shipments oi food to this country and also to hindering the mass reproduction of the insect which threatened India and the U.S.S.R. . 109. A mission of Soviet entomologists (who had been m leisia sime 1941 under the provisions of the Persian-Soviet Anti-Locust Agreement) and a British Locust Control Officer (Mr. O. B. Lean) co-operated with the 1 ersian Ministry of Agriculture in perfecting as far as possible the Persian control organisation, and successive releases of lorries for this organisation weie made by the Anglo-American-Persian Road Transport Board. In addition, Lie support of the Inter-departmental Committee on Locust C ontrol and of the Minister of State Resident in the Middle East enabled Mr. Lean to secure very o enerous assistance from the British military authorities. An Indian ca\alr\ regiment was placed at his disposal for scouting and eventual control opera tions in Khuzistan, and when it transpired that the unusual weather conditions of the winter of 1942-43 had confined the invading swarms to East Persia the Indian army despatched several companies into Kerman Province, where they did excellent work with Mr. Lean. Meanwhile, the Government of India had despatched a representative to the Tehran International Locust Control Com mittee (Dr. K. D. Baweja), whose first-hand information about the westward movement of swarms from India and whose assistance ^n the forward planning of the Persian campaign were of great value. The Soviet mission, for then- part called forward an aeroplane fitted with apparatus for the destruction ot locusts from the air by poison dust and after having installed similar apparatus into five Persian aircraft they supervised effective operations by this method in Khorassan, towards the end of the summer. In spite of the considerable effort employed against them the locusts penetrated as far north as Meshed and as far west as Hamadan district, but the damage to crops was insignificant. 110. In July the Persian Government called an international anti-locust conference in Tehran (at the suggestion of the Anti-Locust Research Centre m I ondon) at which it was generally agreed that preparations must be ma de m the autumn of 1943 for a much more serious campaign in Persia m 1944 Consequently, a Soviet aerial control unit was established at Jiwani, a Royal Air Force anti-locust flight at Bandar Abbas, and British military units at both these centres. Large orders for a new lethal dust (with di-nitro-orthocresol base) were placed in the United Kingdom and the United States. And y November every preparation had been made for a devastating campaign against the swarms which were expected to enter from India and Oman. Ill The non-arrival of Desert Locusts in Persia (owing mainly to a successful campaign in India during the summer of 1943) has been a source of iustifiable disappointment to those who worked so hard to prepare for them, because the success of such a mechanised campaign (an attack on and not a defence against the pest) would have been epoch-making. However the , preservation of the crops from locusts now is the most important thing, and the experience gained from training the units concerned will undoubtedly be ot value in future migratory cycles.'f THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MATElTY’S GOVERNMENT EXT PERSIA.

THE report for 1943 recorded a stormy and eventful year, at the end of which the Persian ship of state appeared to have reached comparatively calm waters. Serious tribal disturbances in the south, fomented by German agents, A 4 . „ . . had been survived, though with small credit to Persian arms. A start had {(W-b) made, with the help of the American experts, on the formidable task of bringing i t / »*» order out of the chaos of the economic and financial administration. Other # American experts had been engaged to assist in the regeneration of the army, the police and the gendarmerie. Persia’s declaration of war on Germany, and her subscription to the Declaration of the United Nations, seemed to have brought •*: *««■ ft 1 **** her down finally on the right side of the international fence. The special pronouncement concerning Persia which had been issued by the participants in the Tehran Conference appeared to have assured for the future her position as an independent and sovereign State. 2. No such major events marked the course of the year 1944 in this country. There were no really serious tribal disorders. No crisis comparable with those of the preceding year occurred in the collection and distribution of food supplies. For more than half the year the Government was headed by a man who, though neither forceful nor experienced, had at least the distinction, very rare in Persia, of being honest and patriotic. 3. Nevertheless, it was a year of all-round disintegration, and by the end of it the country’s prospects of survival were perhaps as dark as they had ever ; been before. For this, three principal causes must be assigned : Persian 1 degeneracy, American inexperience and Russian ill-will. For the most part the Persians holding office thought of nothing but the promotion of their personal interests, and obstructed even such elementary measures of social reform as the introduction of an income-tax law. The new Majlis, after months of wrangling over the credentials of some of its most suspect members, showed itself even less honest, cohesive and capable than the circumstances of its election might have led one to expect. The American economic experts, some of whom were not of a very high calibre and all of whom were constantly thwarted by a massed array of vested interests, proved in the main unequal to their task. 'At the head of them, Dr. Millspaugh himself spoiled what chance he ever had by a rigidly authoritarian manner, an inability to delegate w T ork, and indulgence in a whole series of political indiscretions, so that before the year was out he had become almost completely discredited and was about to be deprived of a large part of his powers. The American militarv advisers accomplished little, but were [64—52]2 inclined to pretend that their allotted task was completed, on the grounds that they were not called upon to supervise the execution of such measures as they had recommended. The American police adviser died after accomplishing nothing at all, and was not replaced. The American gendarmerie advisers, though able and invested with wide powers, battled against incredible corruption without any appreciable sign of headway. And evidence accumulated on all sides that the Russians not only viewed this general deterioration with pleasure, but werj^ actively engaged in accelerating its temfo, working mainly through the agency of the Tudeh party, and a number of more or less genuine labour organisations. Of the many groups which were bent on stultifying the work of the Millspaugh Mission, the Tudeh, whose subservience to the Russians became more and more open, was by far the most virulent and—by reason of its Soviet-inspired internal discipline—effective. Innumerable scurrilous newspapers, believed with good reason to be on the Russian pay-roll or supplied with Russian newsprint, unceasingly attacked as “ reactionaries and Fascists ” all those, whether Persian or foreign, who made any effort to stop the rot. Seyyid Zia ed-Pin Tabatabai (recently returned to Persia after twenty years' exile in Palestine), perhaps the only politician enjoying sufficient personal prestige to have the least chance of effecting serious reforms, was the object of their most venomous slander, being invariably represented as a British agent. 4. Throughout the northern zone the Russians steadily tightened their grip. * They openly encouraged the separatist tendencies endemic in Azerbaijan. They constantly interfered with the attempts of the Persian police and local troops to preserve law and order. They refused to allow the Persian Government to despatch additional troops to the unruly Kurdish areas on the Turkish frontier. * They obliged the local governors to expel Persians hostile to the Tudeh. Their presence, if not their active policy, prevented the northern provinces—by far the richest in the whole of Persia—from contributing a fair share towards the country’s economic prosperity. 5. Even outside “ their ” zone the Russians were guilty of extensive economic exploitation. Although towards the beginning of the year they abandoned their original refusal to pay customs dues on imported goods, they maintained their refusal to allow Persian customs officials to check, or even to see, the goods imported. They demanded cash down for all sales to the Persian Government, but were most dilatory in paying for their own purchases. Having originally obliged the Persian Government to supply munitions and small arms without any discussion of prices, they eventually consented to pay on terms which involved the Persian Government in definite loss—and, even on that unfavourable basis, had by the end of the year paid only about one-tenth of what they owed. Having been prevented by Dr. Millspaugh from repeating the arrangements of the previous year for the barter of Persian rice against goods, some of which were unsaleable—arrangements which had involved the Persian Treasury in a loss estimated at 250 million rials—they effectively hampered his attempts to achieve financial and economic reforms in the northern zone by refusing or delaying the issue of passes to his assistants. Moreover, they sold their goods to merchants at such prices and on such a scale as to promote inflation, and one commodity ; they sold, viz., sugar, must have been rendered surplus to Soviet needs by lease-lend supplies if it was not actually, as some informants believe, lease-lend sugar repacked in Soviet wrappers. They flouted the American efforts to direct road transport into essential channels by using Iransovtrans (a Soviet Government organisation) for unlicensed commercial transport business both within and without the northern zone. They ignored Persian “cabotage” rights by operating unlicensed Russian aircraft on a commercial basis on internal Persian lines. In short, their economic policy, no less than their political influence, was uniformly indifferent to Persian sovereignty and prejudicial to the countrv’s welfare. 6. Towards the end of the year, it is true, the Russians considerably over reached themselves by putting forward a categorical demand for the immediate * grant of extensive oil concessions the terms of which were to be discussed there after, and this demand, backed by a most violent campaign of intimidation, galvanised even the moribund 1 ersian body politic into a positive reaction and some show of national solidarity. But nothing, unfortunately, led one to suppose that they would not have succeeded immediately had they employed slightly less clumsy tactics; or that they would not ultimately achieve*their object by sappino- methods. Soviet, exploitation of the North Persian oil would unquestionably spell the end of real Persian sovereignty in what is alreadv known—inaccurately but not without cause—us “ the Russian zone ahd once these rich northernprovinces had been virtually detached the independence and integrity of Persia would be past praying for. Despite the categorical nature of the lehran Declaration concerning Persia, it is not too much to say that, in the light of all the local Russian activities during the year under review, the disintegration of Persia as a national entity appeared to be the Kremlin’s long-term objective. Nor it possible, for anyone acquainted with the Soviet system and Soviet practice, comfort himself with the theory of a local policy insufficiently controlled by Moscow. 7. From the point of view of the conduct of the war, the close of the year saw one very important development: with the opening of the Black Sea route, Persia would shortly cease to be a channel for the supply to Russia of any appreciable quantities of Allied war material- except aviation spirit. Even aviation spirit would possibly cease to be sent to Russia across Persia after June 1945, and the main justification for the presence in Persia of Allied troops in areas other than tihose contiguous with the southern oilfields would thereby be removed. But His Majesty’s Government considered that British troops could only be withdrawn pari passu with the withdrawal of the Russian forces; and although the presence of these forces was probably not essential to the realisation of the Russian political objective referred to above—for which, indeed, a “ Baltic States ” technique of mock plebiscites and “ spontaneous ' popular appeals was far better suited—there seemed on the face of it very little prospect of inducing the Russians to evacuate promptly any part of the rich areas of Persia which they had made so nearly their own. 8. Throughout the' year the weight of Russian pressure was such that Anglo-Persian relations were largely conditioned by it. There was no cause of direct friction of the slightest importance. Barring one or two minor incidents, the comparatively few British troops in the country behaved admirably. British military intervention in Persian affairs was as unobtrusive as the protection of our vital interests allowed, and was indeed scarcely perceptible outside the oilfields area, except in regard to the internment of undesirables. His Majesty’s Embassy, it is true, lent their full moral support to the unpopular Millspaugh Mission, though towards the end Dr. Millspaugh’s indiscretions made it impossible to continue to support him personally; but the disinterested character of their motives for doing so should be self-evident. Active pro-German pympathies automatically waned as the tide of war turned more and more strongly in our favour. British officers, seconded for service under the Persian administration, played a useful part in grain collection and the organisation of transport. The local personnel of the Middle East Supply Centre—mainly British during the greater part of the year—were manifestly out to afford the maximum of help to Persia within the limits imposed by world shortages and shipping difficulties. 9. It might be supposed that, since in all these and many other ways we compared so favourably with the Russians, there would have been a marked swing of Persian sentiment towards us. That this was not at all obviously the case is due to the fact that cowardice, moral and physical, is an outstanding trait of the Persian character. Probably most Persians realised in their heart of hearts how favourable the comparison was to us; but very few were prepared to displease the Russians by shaping their words and actions accordingly. Vanity, moreover, is next only to cowardice in the Persian make-up, and the national habit is consequently 'to ascribe all the country’s shortcomings and misfortunes to foreign interference. Criticism of the Russians being too dangerous, the British had to serve as scapegoats; and a large proportion of the Persian press was highly critical of British policy. This was true not only of the newspapers known to be controlled or subsidised by the Russians, but also of a good many others. In the matter of the Persian internees, for example, there was much agitation against the actions of the British, while the equal responsibility of the Russians was scarcely ever mentioned. In tribal matters it was the same story : the Persian military were free to conduct operations against the southern tribes without let or hindrance from us, whereas, as stated above, they were not allowed by the Russians to deal with unruly Kurds in the north; yet the press freely accused the “ British imperialists ” of the most sinister machinations in the south, and carefully abstained from all criticism of the Soviet attitude. It is true that the Persian press (which boasts upwards of seventy papers in Tehran v alone) exists largely on blackmail and is not genuinely representative of Persian public opinion. Since, however, it is almost the sole purveyor of information to the public, its influence is by no means negligible; and it w T ould be a mistake to dismiss as unimportant for the future the fact that, during all the year under [64—52] b 24‘ e review, but particularly towards the end of it, Anglo-Persian relations weie grossly distorted in the mirror of the local press. ' „ . 9. In one important respect this fundamental dishonesty of the I ersians in their attitude towards their two principal allies brought upon them an eai ) retribution. Although His Majesty’s Government had obviously suneied much annoyance from the wrong-headed nationalism of Reza Shah, many continued to foster the belief—at once pleasing to the Russians and soothing c Persian national vanity—that the tyrant had been maintained m power by t ie Rritish, w r ho had only discarded their puppet at long last under the stiess ot circumstances beyond their control. The manifest incapacity of the Persians to govern themselves in the post-Reza period was ascribed, under this convenient theory, to the after-effects of the ex-Shah’s tyranny, and hence to the British. In particular, the press never tired of denouncing the alleged greed ot tine Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (which is in fact the main source of the country.s wealth) and of asserting that Reza Shah's attack on the company s former con cession had been a put-up job. When, therefore, the Russians demanded of the Persian Government the immediate grant of an oil concession without prior discussion of its terms, and pretended that in doing so they were only asking for parity with the British, it was impossible for the Persians to retort, as they might otherwise have done, that the British concession had been properl} negotiated and freely accorded. This lesson to liars wms, however, small consola tion to the British victims of the lie, since the resultant weakening of the Persian case was by no means in British interests. 10. Since the Russians became our Allies in 1941, loyalty has damped down criticism of Soviet Russia to such an extent that the toregoing paragraphs, which consist largely of a catalogue of Russian misdemeanours, might give an impression of prejudice. The attempt to avoid giving such an impression has, however, been sadly hampered by the facts. The purpose of an annual review* of this sort is to record salient events and observed tendencies; and in Persia the actions of the Russians have always been of paramount importance. It would have been almost a relief to have been able to record one or two resounding : British misdemeanours in order to give a semblance of balance and objectivity, but here again the facts have been most intractable. British policy, propaganda and action in Persia during the year under review—and, indeed, throughout the whole course of the war—have been monotonously unimpeachable and strictly loyal to our Soviet ally. ... ^ 11. It is indeed'probable that the Soviet authorities, to whom suspicion is second nature, entertain the deepest suspicions of British policy in this country, but unless we are to hark back for ever to u intervention after the last war we . can only regard their suspicions as we regard some of their actions, as easier to explain than to justify. When a Soviet Ambassador, in discussing a financial claim for a few hundred pounds which a Panamanian would settle out of shame, uses the meanness and effrontery of a fraudulent bankrupt, our realisation of the fact that he may be feeling the breath of the N.K.V.D. hot on his neck leads us to understand his attitude but hardly to consider it either honourable or fair. This embassy has deprecated certain small British indiscretions committed since the occupation, not because we thought that reasonable men would be justified in thinking them hostile, but because we know that men who live in constant danger of being liquidated pn suspicion cannot themselves be good judges of straightforward conduct. In only one instance—the aerodrome construction mentioned in the section entitled “ Soviet Interests ” could it be reasonably held that our action gave good ground for suspicion. Did the Russians demand an oil concession in the north because they observed wdth suspicion our attempts to obtain one in the south ? It may be so; but the suspicion is thereby merely explained not justified. To an important extent-Russia owes her salvation during this war to oil supplies from the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company, whether sent to Russia or employed in Persia in the transport of other forms of aid; and the whole record of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company contradicts the allegation that His Majesty's Government exploit British-held oil concessions for unfair political ends. Moreover, if suspicion had been the sole motive for the Russian action, the Soviet Government should have been satisfied once that action had ruled out the grant of a concession to the British, even to the Americans during the w T ar. Do the Russians suspect us of intriguing with the southern tribes against the Central Government ? The Soviet- inspired Persian press has much to say on this subject; yet, whereas we in the south permit and even facilitate the Central Government’s disarmament opera tions in tribal territory, they in Azerbaijan do nothing of the kind. Do the Russians resent the extent and success of our war-time propaganda in Persia?5 No doubt they do; but they know it to be concerned mainly with the winning of the war and strictly loyal to them. Our publicity has given to the Soviet war effort a share of recognition and eulogy which makes a handsome showing beside the ungenerous attempt obvious in almost every number of every Soviet newspaper to minimise the British and American part in the war. Our Public Relations Bureau has tried to draw Persian doctors into contact with British, American and other foreign medical men. Do the Russians consider these purely medical activities as warranting the appointment as head of the Soviet hospital of a man who is known from several sources to have mysterious political functions; who is apparently behind student troubles at the medical school which have resulted m a lock-out; and who recently suggested to a Persian general the formation of a mainly military Government which should be not merely pro- Russian but anti-British. Is it a ground of suspicion that officers of the Persian Air Force are being trained in England ? The Soviet Army might have trained a considerable number of Persian officers in the use of tanks and aircraft if they had not attached to the offer conditions which not even Persians could accept. But the Soviet case was given away when the Soviet Government accused His Majesty’s Government of hostility to them in the matter of the oil concession. This accusation is based in part on the appearance in the British press of articles which mildly attempted to do justice to the Persian case when the Russians, not satisfied with sending forth a stream of falsehoods and abuse against the Persian Government, had through their section of the tripartite censorship in Tehran stopped all messages from foreign correspondents in Tehran which ran counter to the Russian thesis; and in part on our own protest against the violation of the censorship charter by the Russians in the suppression of telegrams despatched by the Persian Prime Minister to Persian diplomatic missions abroad. From this it becamie clear that to obviate Soviet suspicions we must connive at and even facilitate anything, however nefarious, which the Russians might think important to their interests. The test will come when we suggest to the Russians that the time has arrived for the foreign troops to evacuate most if not all of the parts of Persian territory where they are at present stationed. There are indications that they will stay until the latest possible moment, i.e., until six months after the cessation of hostilities with Japan. This would leave Russian troops established throughout the north during the elections, if these are held at the time prescribed by the Constitution; and we know from the Soviet Ambassador, as reported by Mr. Averell Harriman, that he intends to see, so far as he can, that the elections go the right way. The Russian-inspired press has already found a pretext for the retention of the foreign troops in Persia as long as possible, viz., that their withdrawal would not liberate Persia but would leave her at the mercy of outside, i.e., British, influences, as in Reza Shah’s time. Undoubtedly the great Russian grievance against Reza Shah was that he suppressed subversive tendencies, since these were all Russian tendencies. Negotiations for Oil Concessions. (A) British and American. 12. During the greater part of the year representatives of the Shell group, of the Standard Vacuum Company, and (somewhat later in the field) of the American Sinclair Company were in competition for oil concessions over an exten sive area of South Persia. Overt Anglo-American rivalry being undesirable, it was agreed at an early stage between His Majesty's Government and the United States Government that neither should exert pressure on the Persian Government in favour of its nationals. His Majesty’s Embassy afforded unobtrusive support to the Shell representative within the limits of the instructions laid down by the Foreign Office, which were to go no further than was usual on behalf of reputable British interests and no further than the United States Embassy. The quality of the latter’s support of the American oil men turned out to be considerably more active and ostentatious—for a time the United States Embassy carried an oil attache on its staff—than the Anglo-American understanding had led the Foreign Office to expect; and His Majesty’s Embassy were therefore instructed in September to afford more active support on their side should the need for prompt intervention arise. Actually, however, all parties had bogged down at an earlier stage in a quagmire of Persian suspicion and procrastination in which diplomatic support counted for little. 13. There was, indeed, some excuse for the Persian Government’s pro crastination, since they were totally ignorant of the technicalities involved. On Dr. Millspaugh’s recommendation, therefore, they eventually agreed to seekthe assistance of two American experts, Messrs. Hoover and Curtice, who repre sented a firm with a high reputation for supplying foreign Governments with disinterested technical advice on oil matters. These gentlemen arrived in July, and within a few weeks had presented the Persian Government with the results of their study of the competing offers. The Persian Government thereupon formed a committee of their own to examine the whole question; but added constantly to its numbers, as time went on, in response to the suspicious reactions of the Majlis and in the vain endeavour to cover themselves from every angle of fire. The committee, in these circumstances, made very little progress. 14. It should be noted, in view of the subsequent developments, that the Persian press and public as a whole, despite.some disparaging talk of con cession-hunters,” did not appear to be opposed in principle to the grant of concessions to an American or British firm. The suspicions voiced were chiefly to the effect that M. Saed’s Government could not be trusted to extract for the country’s benefit the maximum advantage which the occasion offered. This was, in fact, no more than the inevitable reaction of those not in office, who scented big money and were distressed at the thought of the pickings going into other pockets than theirs. Nevertheless, there appeared to be a general realisation of the political advantages which would accrue from increasing the stake in Persia either of Great Britain or of the United States—particularly the latter. Broadly speaking, only the Tudeh, obviously acting at the behest of the Soviet Embassy, opposed in principle the grant of any concession; demanding both in the Majlis and in its newspapers that none should be granted until, the war over and Allied troops withdrawn, Persia was left mistress in her own house. This demand was to prove embarrassing both to the Tudeh itself and to its masters when, a few weeks later, the Soviet Government demanded the immediate grant of an oil concession in the north; and it seems to show that the Russians, while inclined at first merely to try to prevent their Allies from obtaining oil concessions in an area of no commercial interest to themselves, awoke with a surprising suddenness to the realisation of their own pressing need for Persian oil. (B) Russian. 15. The crisis precipitated by the Russian demand inevitably deprived the British and American companies of all further prospect of obtaining concessions. M. Kavtaradze, Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs, who arrived in Tehran in mid-September, complained to the Shah barely a fortnight later that the Persian Government were being slow in responding to his demand for an extensive oil concession in the north; adding that his Government were not satis fied with Soviet-Persian relations, and that on the economic side the future of these relations might depend on the Persian reply. Five days later he announced, in an interview given to a local newspaper, that the demand had been made on his arrival. According to M. Saed, whom there is no reason to disbelieve, the Persian Government had not even had as long as this to consider the question in secret, for M. Kavtaradze had begun by mentioning only the relatively insignifi cant Khurian oil area (to which in point of fact the Russians had a shadowy but not wholly imaginary claim). 16. The major demand, as eventually put forward, was for exploring rights over almost the whole of North Persia during a period of five years, and there after for a concession covering a maximum of well over two-thirds of that area. This, even in the exploratory period, would have given the Russians ample opportunities for continuing the subversion of Persian authority in a region where the process had already been carried far. But the Persian Government were asked, in addition, to signify their consent without any discussion of terms. 17. M. Kavtaradze’s statement to the press, which naturally caused wide spread alarm, was immediately followed up by an agitation in the local Soviet- controlled newspapers. The Persian Government, however, stood their ground, and M. Kavtaradze was informed towards the middle of October that they had, early in the preceding month, decided to grant no oil concessions while the war lasted. This action was taken after a secret session of the Majlis, at which it had been almost unanimously approved. (The Tudeh, as explained above, were embarrassed by the fact that they had openly advocated an identical ruling in regard to the British and American attempts to obtain a concession in the south.) 18. The Persian Government’s reply was received very ill by M. Kavtaradze, who talked of the possibility of unpleasant consequences and hinted at Persia’s need for Soviet support at the Peace Conference. M. Saed immediately became the subject of a virulent campaign in the Russian-controlled press. Nevertheless,public opinion, after the first shock of dismay, gradually hardened; and on the 19th October the Prime Minister justified his action before a Majlis which was clearly in his favour. 19. The Russians thereupon gave several turns to the screw. They stopped the transport of grain by rail within “ their ” zone; temporarily cut off tele graphic communication with Tabriz; paraded lorry-loads of armed troops in Tehran; intimidated deputies; broadcast false reports of popular and press reactions in their favour; and finally gave it out that their relations with the Persian Government were severed. M. Saed himself, of course, had by this time become a “ fascist ” of the deepest dye. A particularly disquieting feature of Soviet-inspired comment, in view of the general attitude of the Soviet wolf towards the Persian lamb, was to the effect that the Persian Government had been the first to violate the spirit of the Tripartite Treaty of alliance by obstruct ing the passage of supplies to Russia. In a second press interview, M. Kavtaradze alleged that the Prime Minister had originally signified his complete agreement with the Russian demand, only to go back on it later. Apart from the fact that this was categorically denied by M. Saed, it is inconceivable that that honest but timorous man, who had for months past been badgered by the Majlis and the press in regard to the British and American concession-seekers, should have committed himself immediately in regard to the far more disquieting demand from the Russians, whom he knew well from long years of service in the Soviet Union. 20. On the 27th October there was a Tudeh demonstration in Tehran, accompanied by armed Russian troops in lorries; and this was followed by similar demonstrations at Tabriz, Resht, Isfahan and Sultanabad. At Tabriz, where one man was killed and several were wounded during an attempt to rush the police headquarters, the Russians prevented the police and military from dealing with the mob, and had the commanding officer expelled at twenty-four hours' notice. Public opinion, however, was hardening more and more against them, and the Persian Government were emboldened to enforce the existing prohibition on street gatherings. M. Saed issued a full reply to M. Kavtaradze’s second press statement, and this further strengthened the public reaction. The Russians grossly abused their censorship powers to prevent the Persian Govern ment’s case from reaching the outside world (or even the Persian diplomatic representatives abroad), and passed only the accounts of Persian public sentiment which had been fabricated by their own dependents. But the real facts gradually filtered through, and the Russians were consequently obliged to shift their ground by attacking M. Saed less for his refusal to grant the concession, than for his alleged desire to upset Perso-Soviet relations generally and to convert Persia into a base for fascist aggression against the Soviet Union. By the beginning of November, indeed, the Russians were rumoured to be prepared to drop the demand for a concession; and as though to mark the detente they restored grain deliveries by rail and adopted a relatively restrained attitude in regard to the censorship of press messages. But M. Saed, in his new and vaguer role of fascist reactionary, was attacked with ever increasing virulence. The Moscow radio disseminated completely false accounts of nation-wide popular protests against his administration; and preparations for a further Tudeh demonstration in Tehran obliged the Government to occupy the party’s headquarters and to detain some of its leaders for a few hours. The Prime Minister was simultaneously informed by the Russians, through intermediaries, that if he resigned M. Kavtaradze would depart and the demand for an oil concession would be dropped. 21. M. Saed had for some time past been very willing to go, but had been persuaded by the Shah and the Majlis to stay. By now, however, the strain had become intolerable; and on the 10th November the Shah, fearing lest the Russians should resort to extreme measures such as the acceleration of the separatist movement in Azerbaijan, accepted the resignation of a man who had become almost a national hero. 22. Of the new Government formed after some delay by his successor, M. Bayat, it need only be said here that they maintained during the rest of the year the stand which M. Saed had taken. The Russians had no dgubt hoped that M. Bayat, warned by the fate of his predecessor and with no great reputation for honesty or patriotism to maintain, would prove more amenable. But, if so, they reckoned without the Majlis and the popular resentment which their actions had aroused. On the 2nd December a Bill was tabled by Dr. Musaddiq, and passed immediately, which made it illegal for any Persian Government to grant an oil concession to any foreign government or company, and imposed on the8 Government the duty of informing the Majlis of any discussions that might take place concerning the sale of oil or the method of exploiting and administer ing the country's oil resources. Confronted suddenly with this Bill, the democratic character of which was undeniable, the Tudeh were completely taken aback, and were not given time to collect their wits or discuss it amongst them selves. The Russians subsequently asserted that the Bill had been forced through the Majlis unconstitutionally, but this is untrue; the use of the double-urgency procedure is entirely constitutional and by no means uncommon, and the Bill was passed by a large majority. There is no doubt whatever that it expressed the wishes of the Persian people as a whole. An attempt, made immediately after the passage of the Bill, by a deputy who owed his seat to Russian influence, to introduce another cancelling the concession of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, was dropped for lack of a single backer, although in previous debates during the crisis Dr. Musaddiq himself had sharply criticised the company. 23. M. Kavtaradze left Persia on the 9th December, having previously informed the Prime Minister of his Government's displeasure at the new oil law, which, he said, the Majlis would do well to reconsider. The Russians continued till the end of the year (and after it) to agitate in this sense by all the innumerable means at their disposal, and made it quite clear that they were far from regard ing the matter as closed. The Tudeh became, if not more influential, at least very much more active, the Soviet-controlled newspapers more abusive and out spokenly anti-British. There were several further demonstrations in the North, including one at Shahi in which lives were lost and the police were thwarted and publicly humiliated by the Russians in the now customary manner. M. Saed, living thankfully in completely inactive retirement, continued to be attacked with as much ferocity as though he had concluded a military alliance with Hitler him self. So too did Seyyid Zia, who was accused by the Russians—apparently with out the slightest' justification—of having inspired and rushed through Dr. Musaddiq's Bill in collaboration with IVf. Saed and at the behest of his fascist masters (scilicet the British). Both, if the Russian chorus had had its way, would have been arraigned for treason. The Seyyid retorted, indeed, with a vigorous public indictment of Soviet methods, which caused a considerable stir and enhanced his prestige. (In it, incidentally, he made the telling point that the Soviet insistence on the need for a ' l protective belt in North Persia against potential fascist enemies was virtually identical with the Nazi clamour for Lebensraum.) But his chances of coming to power in the more or less immediate future were undoubtedly lessened by these violent Soviet attacks. It is not difficult to conduct a war of nerves in Persia, and at the end of the year the whole country was in a state of apprehension bordering on panic. 24. The Russians, in fact, had not retired from the field empty-handed. True, they had not obtained the north Persian oil; but it is very doubtful whether they needed it for other purposes than the subversion of Persian authority and the' deflection of a part of the Baku output from post-war internal consumption to competition with Great Britain and America in foreign markets. They had, however, acquired something which is often more useful to a great* and unscrupulous Power : a permanent “ grievance value.” As long as any Persian ' Government maintained the stand adopted by M. Saed’s administration—and no other stand was compatible with the preservation of Persian territorial integrity—ft could be bullied and blackguarded as reactionary and Fascist, as rejecting the proffered hand of Soviet friendship in the interests of a foreign clique. If the withdrawal of Allied troops and the inevitable post-war deflation brought about unemployment—as indeed they were bound to do—that would be the criminal fault of a Government which had rejected a charitable Russian scheme for providing employment. Furthermore, the denial to the Russians of an oil concession was in itself an obstacle in the way of the prompt withdrawal of Allied troops; for was not a Government that denied the Russians “ parity in oil matters with the imperialists ” already sold to the latter and committed to a “re-establishment of the dictatorship under foreign tutelage” once the field was clear ? To abandon the Persian people to such unprincipled masters would be a positive betrayal. 25. These and many similar themes were being tirelessly developed in the Soviet-controlled press towards the end of the year. The Russians, by their clumsy brutality during the oil crisis, may have lost a good many genuine Persian admirers; but they had got a very neat double-nelson on all future Persian administrations that evinced the slightest independence of spirit. 26. The theme of the “ denial of parity ” having been constantly developed, not only in the Soviet-controlled Persian press but also in Russian official state ments and in the Soviet Government’s correspondence with His Majesty’shbhmmi ■i 111 ''Wi Government, it is worth pointing out that this tj iem ® * s . fallacious on at three counts; none of which, however, is easy to hand e in • financial place, while it is true that His Majesty’s Government own a a interest in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, they do not run the company^as^a governmental organisation nor use it as a stalking-horse . ■, i,i Persian authority.

Government and the United States'Government. On the 2nd November His Malestvh Ambassador in Moscow addressed written representations to M olotov pointing out that, while His Majesty’s Government were far from contestine the P ri.&gt;-ht of the Soviet Government to seek a concession in North Persia, they considered lhat the Persian Government had the right to refuse, and they themselves had consequently accepted the Persian Government s decision to grant no Uwfihel oil concessions till after the war. To coerce the Persian Government would not, they considered, be in accordance with the Tripartite Treaty and t le Tehran HeclaraGcm^unication did not specifically ask for a jeply and none was received during the crisis. At about the same time the United States Ambassador made representations which are understood to have been on broadly similar lines Oral representations were also made to a member of the Soviet Fmbassv in London on the 18th November. As it was decided in the first instance n™ to Inform the Persians that any representations had been made on then [64—52] C10 behalf, and as it was a long time before the British press and the British Broad casting Corporation began to give a reasonably balanced account of the dispute M. Saed was not aware for many weeks of the extent to which his attitude had the moral support of the British and American Governments; and m these circumstances it was all the more creditable that he and his colleagues should have stood up so well to Russian intimidation. The British and American representations may, however, have served to prevent the Russians from resortm^H^ to even more violent measures. . 31 It was not till the 29th December that the Soviet Government replied, through their embassy in London, to the representations of His Majesty’s Government Their reply, an unsatisfactory document containing several gross mis-statements of fact and a reference to Soviet public opinion which His Majesty’s Government were probably not expected to take seriously, reproached His Majesty’s Government with the &lt;c unfavourable attitude ” they had adopted in regard to the oil negotiations, and ended with an ominous reassertion of M. Kavtaradze’s warning to M. Bayat that the oil law of the ^nd December (described as a “ resolution ’ ’ unconstitutionally adopted) ‘ ‘ ought to be reconsidered.” Suggested Withdrawal of British Forces from Persia. 32 In connexion with the Soviet oil dispute, His Majesty”s Embassy suo-o-ested to the Foreign Office that the possibility should be considered of withdrawing British Forces, at least from Tehran, as soon as aid to Russia was diverted from Persia. There were complications, e.g., the airangement to send aviation spirit from Abadan to the Soviet Union until the middle of 1945 and the fact that the presence of the Royal Air Force in Tehran enabled the British authorities concerned to maintain their connexion with the Persian Air Force and aircraft factory, to supply the necessary technical services for the British Airways line to Tehran. On the other hand, withdrawal offered several advantages : if the British evacuated Tehran, the Soviet authorities must either do the same or expose themselves as less considerate than the British; the evacua tion of Tehran by the foreign troops would in itself strengthen the Persian Government; if the touchiness of the Soviet authorities was due in part to the suspicion of British motives (as it probably was) an offer on our part to evacuate Tehran, and perhaps other places, might help to calm them down, even if at first they did attribute the offer to a wish to remove Soviet influence from the capital. Soviet Interests. 33. The post of Soviet Ambassador in Persia, which had been vacant several months, was filled in January by M. Constantin Mikhailov, but he left 1 eisia in May, ostensibly for medical treatment, and did not return. It is thought he was removed in disgrace because the Persian Government refused to accept the conditions attached to the offer of war material made by Marshal Stalin to the Shah at the Tehran Conference. The Persian Prime Minister saw the ambassa dor the day after the refusal was made and he found him looking ‘ ‘ like a man condemned' to death,” yet maintaining that he was perfectly well. The British and American Embassies found him cold and suspicious and did not regret his departure. M. Mikhailov was succeeded by the former charge d’affaires, M. Maximov, who is an old Persian hand and a clever intriguer, but is human, has a sense of humour and can be teased into taking routine action. The change, therefore, was for the better in spite of the difficult behaviour of the Soviet Embassy regarding the Soviet Government’s oil dispute with Persia and regarding the policy of the Anglo-Soviet-Persian censorship. 34. During the course of the year there were several scares regarding Soviet troop movements in Persia, but these turned out to be routine replacements. 35. There is one aspect of British activities in Persia which may have given the Russians reasonable cause for suspicion. The aerodromes at Mirjawa and Zahedan were completed at a time when, as a result of the discontinuance of the East Persia supply route, they were no longer needed for military aid to Russia; and work on the aerodrome at Kerman was still continuing at the end of the year. The Zahedan-Kerman and Zahedan-Meshed roads are still being maintained, though they too are no longer needed for sending supplies to the Soviet Union. It seems that the work begun on the aerodromes when the Germans were in the Caucasus was continued with a view to their eventual use as communication airfields on what is, in fact, the most direct route between India and Europe. The Meshed road has been kept up as a potential route11 for aid to China through Soviet Central Asia and the Kerman road is being maintained in connexion with the work proceeding on the airfield at Kermam A visit to South-East Persia late in the year by the Soviet military attache suggests that the Russians are not without interest in these activities. 36. The Soviet authorities attempted to develop cultural activities in the /c^ourse of the year, but did not make very much progress. In February the inauguration ceremony was held of a Committee for Soviet-Persian Cultural Relations, of which the Persian Prime Minister and Soviet Ambassador are honorary presidents. In the course of the spring the society issued some impres sive statutes, but its sole activity in the course of the year was to organise classes for learning Russian. (There is considerably less demand for Russian culture than for British culture, and this perhaps intensifies Russians suspicions of us.) Soviet-sponsored “ Union of Polish Patriots.''’ 37. The Soviet-sponsored “Union of Polish Patriots ” set up an office in Tehran early in the year and began to angle for support among the Polish refugees, using as bait the offer to allow them to rejoin their relations in Russia or to communicate with them and send them parcels. The Polish Legation told His Majesty’s Embassy that these blandishments would not have much effect, since one taste of the Soviet “ Paradise ” was enough for most of the refugees however much they loved their families. The Polish Legation’s prophesy proved correct. • 38. The Union of Polish Patriots succeeded, however, in being a nuisance to His Majesty’s Embassy, since their written and radio propaganda was liable to censorship by the Anglo-Soviet-Persian Censorship, and the censoring of their material by the British section led to difficulties with the Soviet section. A nglo-Soviet-Persian Censorship. 39. In this, as in so many other matters, the year 1944 saw a regrettable reversion to type on the part of the local Soviet representatives. The so-called Tripartite Censorship Commission (in reality an Anglo-Soviet organisation, with a Persian sleeping partner) functioned smoothly enough as long as Russia was in desperate need of the support of her Allies. Censorship was confined to its legitimate sphere—the suppression of material damaging to Allied war interests. But in the spring of the year under review the Soviet section of the commission suddenly began to exercise a rigid ideological censorship, and suppressed large quantities of English newspapers and books, including standard works such as H. A. L. Fisher’s History of Europe. Under the terfns of the commission’s charter, each of the three sections had the right to condemn material which it judged to be— “ detrimental to the interests of Persia or the Allies, such as giving away State-or war secrets, or spreading anti-Allied propaganda: and any 'message likely to weaken the political or economic strength of the Allied Governments, or to prejudice their friendly relations.” But provision was also made for close co-ordination between the three sections and hence, by natural implication, for the exchange of all necessary explanations. The British section, therefore, while not disputing the right of its Russian counterpart to act as it had done, attempted to obtain reasoned explanations of its action. No explanations in the least satisfactory or detailed were ever forthcoming. The truth is probably that the Russian section, true to Soviet political principles, considered wholesale suppression as laudable and natural action, from the performance of which it had only refrained in the past owing to the necessity for accommodating valuable Allies. Some of the suppressed British material was indeed critical of Soviet affairs in varying degrees; but for the most part the criticism was not only fair, but also extremely mild—far more so than the habitual tone of the Soviet press in regard to the Western Allies. For example, one British newspaper which the Soviet section condemned— at a moment when the Soviet press was most critical of the Western Allies for their failure to establish a so-called Second Front—merely pointed out that the splendid Russian victories had been to some extent facilitated by Anglo- American air attacks on German industrial targets. Moreover, it was clear that the Soviet section, in its new-found zeal for Stakhanovite methods, had taken to the regular suppression of certain British publications out of hand, without troubling to examine their contents. 40. The Russians unfailingly suppressed all British war maps which showed the re-1939 frontiers of Eastern Europe (marked as such), although these [64—52] c 212 maps were for the most part designed as propaganda for the Russian victories Soviet maps imported into Persia showed, as finally incorporated m the Soviet Union, the earlier Russian victories of the Molotov-Ribbentrop period. 41. In one respect the Soviet section transgressed the letter, as well as the spirit, of the censorship charter; it regularly suppressed large quantities of publications addressed to Persian Departments of State, and even, on occasion,^ material addressed to the heads of Allied diplomatic missions. When tackled^ on this subject its only excuse was that it had in the past connived in the Bi itish section's unofficial suppression for military reasons, of certain categories of printed matter addressed to neutral diplomatic missions and consulates from neutral countries bordering on Germany and German-occupied Europe, rhis was true, but scarcely justified the Soviet section s action in depriving the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs of copies of the Sphere, and the Persian Ministry of Finance of copies of the Economist. 42/ The Soviet publications entering Persia contained plenty of material calling for suppression on a reciprocal basis. Some of them were doctrinaire works''on communism, which, though recently published, repeated the savage attacks on British policy and reference to “ the second imperialist war which had been normal in Russia before Hitler forced her to range herself on the side of the democracies. Most of them indulged in venomous abuse of the Polish Government in London. Before deciding on retaliation, however, a determined effort was made, on instructions from the Foreign Office, to persuade the Soviet authorities to take a more reasonable line. The Soviet Ambassador was given a detailed analysis of the voluminous material suppressed by his section; was reminded in polite circumlocutions that two could play at this game, and was told that in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government the suppression of material on ideological grounds was out of keeping with the spirit both of the alliance and of the' censorship charter itself. M. Maximov adopted the customary Soviet line. While promising to examine the censorship material afresh, and to report the British representations to Moscow, he refused to admit for a moment that the Soviet section could possibly have erred, or that any Soviet publication could conceivably be found objectionable from the point of view of inter-Allied relations. 43. TThis was in August; and by the end of the year M. Maximov was still &lt;c awaiting Moscow’s reply.’ Meanwhile, British (and American) material continued to be suppressed in very large quantities. Consequently the British section, which had in the meantime acquired a reader in Russian and Polish, was authorised to suppress an appreciable but relatively insignificant quantity of objectionable Soviet material consisting foi; the most part of scurrilous attacks on “ the Polish emigre clique.” Up to the end of the year the Soviet Embassy had not reacted to these measures, though the Soviet section of the Censorship had complained in tones of outraged innocence to its British counterpart. 44 Until late in the year the Public Relations Bureau of His Majesty’s Embassy and the Soviet Trade Delegation, both of which were importers of books and periodicals destined for the Persian public, remained exempt from the control of the Joint Censorship Commission. Then, however, the Soviet censor complained of the fact that the Public Relations Bureau was selling, at its own premises, copies of publications which had been condemned by him when sent through the ordinary post. Shortly afterwards he began to examine the parcels addressed to the bureau. His Majesty’s Embassy caused the publications in question to be withdrawn, but protested through the British censor against the examination of material addressed to an organisation which was an integral part of the embassy. This protest was ignored, and the British censor was therefore authorised to examine the material addressed to the Soviet trade delegation, for which diplomatic privilege is claimed by the Russians. 45. The Soviet authorities adopted an equally unreasonable line in regard to local broadcasts. They played havoc with the ^material—for the most part quite unprovocative—submitted by the Polish Legation for its allotted time on the Tehran Radio, and when, in order to restore the balance, the British censor suporessed the more objectionable features of the material submitted by thu Soviet-sponsored “ Polish patriots,” the Soviet Embassy countered by broad casting subsequent instalments without submission to the censorship, as pro grammes put out under their own auspices. Security. 46. At the beginning of the year the Persian suspects on the British and Soviet lists were all interned at Sultanabad under British control, but as a result of the strong pressure exercised by His Majesty’s Embassy during the preceding13 months, the suspects not on the British list were transferred to Resht, in the Russian “zone,” in February. Joint investigation by the Anglo-Persian Com mission of the suspects on the British list was completed in February, and it was decided to release twenty-three; only one of them, however, was found to be completely innocent: the remainder were made to sign an undertaking to. refrain ^from anti-Allied activities. The Soviet Embassy were consulted as to the release of these persons and they concurred. Further releases of lesser fry were made by the British authorities in the course of the year. In April the internees still remaining at Sultanabad were transferred to an internment camp in Tehran and placed under Persian control, but under general British supervision. 47. After prolonged negotiations the Qashgai tribe handed over to the British authorities early in the year four Germans whom they had been harbouring for a number of months. A fifth German ha^d been allowed to escape two or three weeks before and he has so far evaded capture. He is known to be with the Beir-Ahmedi tribe. There are no other German undesirables loose in Persia. After further negotiations, the Qashgai tribe surrendered the Persian Deputy, Naubakht, in the month of May. Naubakht had fled from Tehran and taken sanctuary with the Qashgai in August, 1943, after His Majesty s Embassy had informed the Persian Government that thev had documents showing that he was one of the chief instigators of the anti-Ailied plot of 1943. In June the British Security authorities located the Mullah Kashani, the most dangerous member of the conspiracy, in a villa in the hills north of Tehran and effected his arrest in collaboration with the Persian police. Out of the. list of Persians whose arrest by Persian authorities was demanded by the Allies, there are some minor ones still at liberty about whom we do not think it worth while to bother, and a few more important ones have escaped to Turkey, in some cases with the obvious connivance of Persian officials. 48. There are signs that the Soviet authorities are planning to use some of these internees as agents. The British authorities allowed them to take Naubakht and the Mullah Kashani to Resht for interrogation, and it was noticed that the Soviet officers who returned them to the British Security authorities treated them with the greatest consideration, talking with them on the most friendly terms and shaking hands with them in farewell. Kashani expresses the greatest detestation of the British and says openly that when he is released he will do us all the harm he can. Again, the Soviet Embassy sent to this embassy towards the end of the year their first list of internees whom they proposed to release. Among the names was that of General Aghevli, who, at the time of his arrest, was commanding the gendarmerie and against whom there was conclusive written and oral evidence that he held a key position in the anti-Allied plot. For some time the Soviet Security authorities had been trying, without success, to persuade their British colleagues that Aghevli was not seriously guilty, and the Soviet Embassy’s proposal was the sequel. This embassy felt bound to refuse Aghevli’s release and to say that if his name had not been on the Soviet list, he would have been put on ours. There is no doubt that the Soviet authorities expected assistance from Aghevli if he had been released through their efforts. “ Aid to Russia.” 49. The total “Aid to Russia” tonnages transported on the (American and Russian operated) Persian State railways in 1944 was :— 1,601,381 tons. This includes ocean-borne cargo for Russia landed at Persian Gulf ports, also 32,500 tons of aviation spirit and 5,000 tons of alkylate per month, and in addition 60,000 tons of motor spirit despatched between August and November inclusive, all from the refineries of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company at Abadan. 50. The total “ Aid to Russia ” cargo carried by the United States Motor Truck Service, United Kingdom Commercial Corporation trucks, British Army General Purposes Transport Companies and by imported trucks for Russia assembled by United States truck assembly plants at Andimeshk and Khorramshahr and by the British Army Vehicle Assembly Unit at Rafidiyah, Iraq, was :— 950,359 tons. This includes the weight of the trucks imported into the Soviet Union. 51. The British Army General Purposes Transport Companies employed on “ Aid to Russia ” lift ceased operations at the end of February 1944. United Kingdom Commercial Corporation trucks ceased operations from Khanaqin at14 the end of September. United States Motor Truck Service finished their “ Aid to Russia ” lift at the beginning of December. The only motor trucks con tinuing to lift “ Aid to Russia ” cargo at the end of the year were those imported as cased motor trucks and assembled by the United States truck assembly plant at Khorramshahr. 52. In December the United States truck assembly plant at Andimeshk was dismantled and despatched to Odessa. The Soviet Government advised the- British army that the vehicle assembly plant at Rafidiyah would not be required to assemble any more trucks after December 1944. The United States truck assembly plant at Khorramshahr therefore remains the. only plant assembling imported cased motor trucks for Russia. It has a capacity now of over 5,000 units per month. When all three above-mentioned truck assembly plants were working they averaged 8,500 truck units per month in 1944. 53. About 1,000-1,500 tons net weight per month of aircraft were assembled at Abadan by the United States Plane Assembly Plant and at the British Aircraft Assembly Plant at Shuaiba and flown to Russia via Tehran. Both the aircraft plants ceased to assemble aeroplanes for Russia in December 1944. 54. In April 1943 the average ship turnround in the Persian Gulf ports, Khorramshar, Bandar Shapur and Basra was no less than fifty-one days. By October 1944 it had been improved to seven days. 55. As regards 1945, with the opening of the Black Sea ports Odessa and Kherson the “ Aid to Russia ” ocean-borne tonnage via the Persian Gulf from January 1945 is rapidly falling off, i.e .—• January 1945 ... ... 61,588 actually forwarded. February 1945 ... ... 45,000 estimated. March 1945 ... ... -20,000 estimated. 56. The aviation spirit at 32,500 tons and alkylate at 5,000 tons per month will continue to the 30th June, 1945. No motor spirit for Russia will be forwarded in the period to the 30th June, 1945. 57. The assembly of cased motor trucks for the Soviet Union will continue at approximately 5,000 units per month up to the end of March and will then fall to about 300 units in April. The Russians are negotiating for the transfer of the United States Truck Assembly Plant at Khorramshar to a Black Sea port, which will mean that the import of cased motor trucks for Russia will cease after April. 58. The United States Persian Gulf Command has closed its operations in Bandar Shahpur and this port, together with the railway from Bandar Shahpur to Ahwaz is being handed back to the Persian Government. The Soviet transportation directorate in Persia have stated that they will reduce their personnel and commitments in the northern zone as the “ Aid to Russia ” cargo diminishes and that after the aviation spirit and alkylate commitment is finished in June their organisation in Persia will probably cease to function as from mid-July 1945. A Hied Co-operation in Persia. 59. During their visit to London in April, Mr. Stettinius and Mr. Wallace Murray raised the question of Allied co-operation in Persia. It was agreed to suggest to the Soviet Government that conversations should be held between the Allied representatives in Tehran to implement more fully the provisions of the Declaration of the Tehran Conference regarding economic assistance to Persia. The Soviet Government concurred, and the first meeting was held on the 3rd June. The American Charge d’Affaires and His Majesty’s Ambassador suggested that the Soviet Embassy, together with the Persian Government, should be represented on the new Inter-Allied Higher Supplies Committee. (This would supersede the existing Combined Supplies Committee which was only Anglo- Amencan and confined its attention, so far as imports were concerned, to entering the country from the south or east.) A second meeting was held on the 21st June! The British and American representatives impressed on the Soviet Ambassador that it was in Russia’s own interests, if only as beneficiaries of a trans-Persian i oute, to contribute to Persia s well being. The British and American repre sentatives proceeded cautiously with a proposal made by the State Department that the Soviet Ambassador should be pressed to support the American advisers. Since the latter were mistrusted by the Soviet authorities, it was not desirable to endanger the future of the joint economic discussions by bringing uo this dangerous matter too brusquely. The meeting then discussed'the grain situation and agreed that all possible help must be given by the Allies to ensure the collection of the Persian Government’s share of the grain. The Soviet Ambassador on15 instructions from Moscow, asked for further information about the proposed Higher Supplies Committee. It was clear that the Soviet Government were afraid that they might be voted down. The British and American representatives explained that the committee would not vote and would have no executive powers, but would only try to ascertain Persia’s resources and needs and the possibility of meeting these needs from Allied sources. In the course of June the American ^Charge d'Affaires communicated to the Soviet Ambassador a scheme by the American Director of Road Transport(') in the north. The Soviet Ambassador promised to study this, but he was guarded and tended to throw doubt on the need for Americans. No further meetings were held pending the reactions of the Soviet Government to the proposal made. No reply was ever given, but what with the Soviet oil dispute with the Persian Government on the one hand, and on the other the improvement in the grain situation and the better war news, both the feasibility of the scheme and the need for it diminished. 60. In 1944 Persia was the one country where British, American and Soviet civil and military authorities met on a broad land front and the necessary contacts at the various technical levels proceeded reasonably smoothly and efficiently, in spite of the difficulties in the political sphere. One excellent reason for this was, of course, that ‘ ‘ Aid to Russia ’ ’ through Persia really delivered the goods during 1944. The American Advisory Missions. (a) General. 61. It is regrettable to have to report that the American Advisory Missions did not on the whole do well in the course of the year, in spite of the strong support given them by His Majesty’s Embassy, who cannot envisage the possibility of their disappearance with equanimity, since this must inevitably increase the chaos and corruption in Persian administration which in turn might give the Russians a pretext to step in. 62. In the course of the summer, His Majesty’s Government explained to the United States Government that they were most anxious for the missions to remain and in certain cases to be strengthened, since they were convinced that Persia’s need for foreign assistance would continue to be great, particularly in the immediate post-war period; they were specially concerned about the future of the Persian police. When Allied troops are withdrawn, a large measure of responsibility for internal security would fall on the police, which in its present state was quite unable to bear it; this might have particularly serious consequences in the oil refinery area. His Majesty’s Government were anxious, therefore, that reforms should be put in hand before the departure of British troops. This could not be carried out without foreign assistance and they would prefer that this should be provided by the United States if possible, 'if, however, the United States Government felt unable to provide it, His Majesty’s Government would have to consider advising the Persian Government to look elsewhere. The State Department replied that the United States Government were not losing interest in Persia, but they had no fixed policy of retaining advisory missions there. They had, for instance, always made it clear to the Persian Government that American advisers must not be exposed to vilification. If attacked the Persian Government must defend them, otherwise they would be withdrawn and would not be replaced The United States Government had now decided that:— (1) Colonel Schwartzkopf and his five assistants would be left for a further year with the gendarmerie. (2) They would investigate whether Colonel Schwartzkopf might take over the police as well. (3) General Ridley would remain until the 1st March, 1945. by which date the United States War Department thought that he would have done everything possible to accomplish his task ; the War Department would probably decline to appoint a successor and were inclined to con centrate on the gendarmerie and police. 63. His Majesty s Charge d’Affaire’s comment on these decisions was that if General Ridley left in March 1945, he would not have accomplished all the work covered by his contract and that such work as he had achieved would in any case be rapidly undone if he left. Mr. Lascelles went on to discuss how far the possession of an efficient army would really be useful and necessary to Persia ( l 2 3 ) For the management of road transport .16 in post-war conditions. As long as the present Shah remained on the throng the army would play a preponderant role m the country s aftairs and rema the chief instrument of internal security For the Americans to concentrate on the gendarmerie and police would be all very well if they obtained an increasing share of the revenue at the expense of the army; the continued presence o General Ridley’s Mission would not entirely solve this problem but would at least limit it sufficiently to give Colonel Schwartzkopf a fair chance. Hi^ Maiesty’s Government thereupon urged the United States Government to let Colonel Schwartzkopf have additional staff so as to enable him to take over the police, but as regards General Ridley they confined themselves to as ang w ic er, in the event of his task not being completed by that date, the War Departmen would let him stay on until he had finished. The State Department replied that the War Department did not hold out much hope of keeping General Ridley pn beyond March 1945 unless he himself recommended it. They succeeded m persuading the War Department of the importance of improving the police, but did not feel justified in proposing the matter to the Persian Government. The latter either'of their own accord, or at British prompting must make a definite request that Colonel Schwartzkopf should take over the police. His Majesty s Government instructed this embassy to impress upon the Persian Government the importance of acting quickly in the matter. Approaches to the Persian Prime Minister and Minister of Interior, however, produced no result, probably because of the known hostility of the Russians to the presence of American advisers in Persia, and the opposition to Dr Millspaugh m the Majlis which was becoming more and more violent and tended to prejudice toe question of the employment of American advisers in general. (b) Dr. Millspaugh’s Mission. 64. From April onwards there was a campaign against Dr. Millspaugh and his colleagues both in the Majlis and in the press. The more important criticisms were ;— (1) That the mission had not reorganised the finances nor prevented a rise in prices nor assured supplies. „ . . . . . (This charge is in many ways unfair. Dr. Millspaugh did his best during a period of inflation to increase revenue and reduce expenditure but was faced, through no fault of his own with a considerable deficit on the previous year s working. It is perhaps true, however, that his attempt to impose a much higher income-tax than before was unsound psychologically. Even in more civilised and less corrupt countries it usually takes a number of years before people can be persuaded to pay income-tax honestly and before an administrative cadre can be developed that will ensure collection. Dr. Millspaugh’s income-tax has therefore been a failure, but the Persians, whose fault it is, are the last people who are entitled to criticise him for it. Again, the rise in prices is largely due to the presence of the Allied forces in this country and it is unlikely that the price level will fall until they are withdrawn or until the end of the war with Germany is in sight; Dr. Millspaugh’s measures were probably responsible for a marked slackening in the rate of increase of the price level. On the other hand there is more substance in the third part of the charge, that supplies have not been assured. Although large quantities of commodities such as piece goods, tea sugar and drugs are in the country and under Government control, they do not for most part reach the consumer at reasonable prices. Here again Dr. Millspaugh was defeated by the dishonesty of the average Persian; you cannot distribute goods far and wide through the land when you cannot trust anybody to distribute them honestly. In so far as country districts have received rationed supplies at all it is mainly due to personal supervision by the local American officials.) . (2) That the expenditure of Persian Government money on the administra tion of the Supply Department, the Price Stabilisation Section and Road Transport organisation was excessive. (The pay of the American personnel in these departments is very high by Persian standards, but their work is essential to Persian economy and the expenditure is consequently justified.) (3) That some of the members of the mission were incompetent. (This is true to some extent but it is due (a) to the difficulty of securing p-ood men in war time, and (b) to the inexperience of Americans in the field of adviser to foreign Governments. Nevertheless at least a dozen of the Millspaugh Mission are capable men. As regards Dr. Millspaugh himself, his qualities17 could be described as follows : He is honest and tenacious, but extremely obstinate. He has administrative ability up to a point, but (a) he tender „ , powers in himself—this hampered and offended his American £0 lea gues a caused delay; and (b) he was inclined not to discuss proposals sufficiently belo issuing orders—this led to the commission of avoidable mistakes I n any case, _ the mission had many enemies on account of its virtues as we .1 , ^The Shah disliked Dr. Millspaugh, who was unwilling as well as &gt;anable to provide money for so large an army as the Shah would ike to have, a imprudent enough to say, in an interview to the press, l he ^minty f in Persia were not worth the money expended on them. Th ® ^' s ® la “ s ’ h ’ were suspicious of, and unhelpful to, the mission. Fina y, down urices powerful Persians who stood to lose by the mission s efforts to bring down puces ^nd to control financial abuses. 65. The campaign against Dr. Millspaugh led to the tabling of a Govenimen t Bill in the Majlis on the 22nd June depriving him of his economic powers on the ground that he had not shown sufficient results (A-S stated in paragraphs ‘ind 87 of this embassy’s report on political events m 1 eisia m 1943, _ • paugh had been given, in addition to his financial powers, wide economic powers under the “Millspaugh Special Powers Law.”) Dr. Millspaugh forthwith resigned The Government then decided—quite rightly that thev could not c without him. The Bill was withdrawn, and Dr. Mmspaugh agreed ^ rrnnam office - but he continued to be under strong criticism, justifiable and unjustifiable. In August Dr Millspaugh granted another unfortunate interview to the pi ess, which he said that the United States was the only country which had championed Persian freedom and that if his mission had not been present m Persia one of three things would have happened : (a) disturbances leading to the occupation of North and &amp; South Persia, by the Russians and British respectively; (b) occupation of the country by an international force; (c) a dictatorship even more ngorom than Reza Shah ^ ^ au t U mn, he dismissed Mr. A. H. Ibtihaj from his position as governor of the National Bank (without consulting persons such as His Maiestv’s Ambassador or the American Ambassador, who would have been m a JoS to gfve good advice). The Government thereupon cancelled the order of rpQTtti^al as outside Dr. Millspaugh s powers. It is true that Mr Ibtinaj naci for lone been a violent and open critic of Dr. Millspaugh’s and obstructed is work- but Dr. Millspaugh’s action showed a want of political sense which was inexcusable The result was an increase in the agitation against him; at the en of the year a debate was taking place in the Majlis on a renewed proposal to deprive h-^h^w^'clirthat Dr. Millspaugh must go the Persian Govern ment appeared anxious to keep the rest of the Millspaugh mission, and His Majesty’s Government instructed this embassy to do everything possible to secure their retention. (c) American Military Mission. 68. General Ridley’s mission now consists of the full complement of twenty 69. General Ridley himself paid a visit to the United States during the summer in order to obtain equipment and, it was learnt confidentially to discuss the future of his mission. Its achievements are described m the section on the Persian army. General Ridley himself, never a forceful character, seems tired and his influence is less and less in evidence. The members of the mission, catching his infection and appalled by the magnitude of their task, have become dispirited. The activities of the mission are now limited to matters of transport and supp y, 3nd to giving unheeded advice about the medical services. His scheme tor the centralised training of recruits has been abandoned after a limited and unhappy trial. He says that his task, which he now interprets as little more than the organisation of systems of supply, transport and accounting, will be finished in a fe '' ^^One is forced to the belief that the army authorities engaged the mission as a Santa Claus who would fill their stocking with exciting weapons of the latest desion while relying on their powers of passive resistance and “ sabotage with a smile ” to nullify any disturbing tendencies on the part of the mission to act the part of a new administrative broom. (d) American Gendarmerie Mission. 71. (See under “ Persian Gendarmerie.”) [64—52] * D18 (e) American Police Adviser. 72. Mr. Timmerman, the quite useless American police adviser, died suddenly in May. He has not been replaced (see also (a) above). Raising of His Majesty's Legation and United States Legation to the Status of Embassies. ^ 73. At the end of 1943, the President of the United States decided to iaise the American Legation at Tehran to an embassy; as a result of the lehran Uon- ference declaration regarding Persia, the United States Government regarded the latter as a co-belligerent, and it was their policy to have embassies in co-belligerent countries. 74. His Majesty's Government decided to follow suit, and on the 10th February the two legations announced the change. His Majesty s Ambas sador presented his new credentials on the 9th March. The Persian Legation in London was likewise raised to an embassy. A merican Interests. 75. The American Minister, Mr. Dreyfus, went on leave after the lehran Conference and did not return, and Mr. Leland Burnette Morris was appointed as first American Ambassador. His Majesty’s Government, at the instigation of His Majesty’s Embassy, urged the Luiited States Government to send him to Tehran soon, on the grounds that the lack of co-ordination between the American* advisers in Persia was disturbing and that it should be the function of the American Ambassador to supply that co-ordination; for instance, Dr. Millspaugh, the head of the financial mission, and General Ridley, the head of the military mission, were unable to agree on the sums which should be allotted to the Persian army. Mr. Morris, however, only arrived on the 12th August, and if he came with any instructions to co-ordinate the efforts of the American advisers, he did not reveal the fact, although he seemed to be impressed by the arguments of His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that such action was necessary. 76. The Hitlerian methods used by the Soviet Government in pressing the Persian Government to grant them an oil concession appear to have contributed to a change in the views held by Mr. Wallace Murray, who deals with Middle Eastern affairs in the State Department. In the past he has had a reputation of being extremely suspicious of British imperialist machinations. His Majesty’s Embassy in Washington reported, however, that he was now constantly pre occupied with the fear of Soviet penetration in the Balkans and the Middle East, and that he was anxious to co-operate with the British on every issue. 77. The reduction at the end of the year of aid to Russia through Persia led to the departure of Lieutenant-General Connelly from the command of the American Persian Gulf Command. He was replaced by Brigadier-General Booth. British Propaganda Activities. 78. Propaganda and publicity material have been put out by the Public Relations Bureau throughout the year through channels which have consistently developed since the bureau was opened in Victory House (the former German Brown House) in January 1942. The press attache’s section produces a weekly publication Tafsir containing articles translated from material received from the Ministry of Information on subjects of world-wide interest with special emphasis laid upon Britain’s and the British Empire’s part in the war. This illustrated weekly is sent freely to some 11,400 leading Persians throughout the country, including every member of the Majlis. The bureau’s other Persian publications include the Nau Nehalan, a fortnightly children’s newspaper with a circulation (20,000) only limited by the amount of newsprint available. It has a larger circulation than any other newspaper in Persia and is distributed almost entirely through the co-operation of the Ministry of Education to schools throughout the country. The editor is assisted voluntarily by a Persian editorial board. The Shah sent a personal message to the children of Persia through the medium of this paper over a year ago and his example was followed by Queen Fawzia when she sent a message to the women of Persia through the medium of Alame Zanan, a monthly woman’s magazine, started by the Public Relations Bureau in July. It is popular amongst those who read it but unfor tunately Persian women form but a small proportion of the country’s exiguous reading public and circulation is not likely to increase greatly above its present level of 4,000.19 79. The Tehran Daily News, the English paper published by the Public Relations Bureau now has three two-page and three four-page issues weekly and contains world news and leading articles from The Times and other papers as well as feature articles received from the Ministry of Information in London and Cairo. The paper has how risen to a daily circulation of just on 4,000. ^ 80. The broadcasting section has throughout the year continued its half- hour daily programme “ The Voice of Britain ” from Radio Tehran. The Sunday time was surrendered to the French, Poles and Dutch, who arranged their own programmes. Political and world affairs were covered by three weekly newsletters. For the rest, the programmes were made up of Persian guest speakers who gave talks on various aspects of social welfare, on English litera ture, education, and kindred subjects. In December it was, however, decided that the time had come to cease broadcasting 11 The Voice of Britain ” from Radio Tehran and the authorities have been told that as one step in the return to normal this half-hour will be returned to them at Naruz (21st March). The chief reason for deciding to take this step was the hope that it might lead to the Russians’ also ceasing to broadcast their Irano-Soviet Culture Society’s pro grammes from Radio Tehran as these had become progressively less and less cultural and more and more aggressive and objectionable political broadcasts. 81. The films section issues Ministry of Information newsreels to the com mercial cinemas throughout the country (some fifty in number), and in order to maintain their equipment and programme, assists them in importing essential parts and in smoothing transport difficulties. In December a contract for twenty- four British films was completed, the most important British film contract yet placed in Persia. In addition, this section has seven touring mobile cinemas and nine portable sound projectors. Educational film shows at institutes, colleges and schools throughout the country are organised and arranged in.co-operation with the Ministry of Education and the University Faculties^ 1 ) All film shows are extremely popular in Tehran, and His Majesty’s consulates report similar enthusiasm for films in the provinces and in the places visited by the vans. 82. Throughout the year window displays and reading-room exhibitions have been prepared by the Visual Publicity Section for showing both in Tehran and by all consulates in the provinces. Reading material has been widely dis tributed both through Persian newsagents and booksellers and from the Public Relations Bureau’s own show-rooms at most centres. 83. His Majesty’s consulates report continued efforts by the Russians to extend the field of their own publicity. There is to-day no apparent effort on the part of the Persians to resist our publicity; on the contrary, more Persians than ever now advise us as to how our campaigns should be conducted to be successful. Co-operation is generous and appears to be whole-hearted since much help is given both voluntarily and without payment. British Council. 84. The British staff of the council in Persia numbers twenty-five; they are assisted by twenty local staff and twenty-four part-time teachers. These control the English teaching of upwards of 4,000 students in institutes, evening classes, universities, Government and private schools and agricultural and technical colleges. 85. Institutes at Tehran and Isfahan cater for 1,500 and 400 students respectively and the new institute at Shiraz, officially opened in November, has already over 600 students. These three institutes provide English teachers and class-rooms as well as club amenities and games, a library, film displays, reading rooms, lectures, concerts and drama. 86. Three evening schools teach over 900 students outside the institutes. A summer school near Tehran taught 250 students in outdoor classes and pro vided concerts, a swimming pool and Shakespearian performances in an open-air theatre. 87. Over 80,000 books, including text-books, periodicals and technical bulletins have been distributed. Sets of books have been presented to universities, colleges and clubs. 88. Educational film displays were seen by over 60,000 persons and were given in schools and colleges. Radio lessons in English are broadcast five days weekly. ( x ) The Public Relations Bureau also run a newsreel cinema, built at their instigation, which shows a weekly change of programme of one hour, consisting of newsreels and Ministry of Information shorts . . . [64—52] d 289. Other activities include an art school, physical training and dress making classes, a debating society, drama, chess and universities clubs; a medical association, art exhibitions, a theatre and restaurant in lehran, as well as private tuition and coaching classes. 90. Six scholarships have been granted for post-graduate scholars to England. Students are prepared for Cambridge and matriculation examinations and children are placed at schools and colleges in England. 4 Middle East Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Polish Refugees. 91. At the beginning of the year the total number of Polish civilians in Persia was 9,622. By the end of the year it had been reduced to 4,435. The Poles who left went to the following destinations : Palestine, the Lebanon, India, East Africa, Rhodesia, and New Zealand. Others went to join the Polish armed forces. Half of the children's school at Isfahan and their attendant grown-ups still remain to be evacuated. Once they are gone, there will be no Poles left in Persia apart from {a) those employed by the British and American armed forces and Government organisations, and (h) those living by their own efforts, who consequently are their own masters and free to leave or stay as they wish, subject only to Persian regulations regarding permis de sejour. 92. Expenditure on the Polish refugees in Persia at the beginning of 1944 was the equivalent of £119,000 per month, but it diminished to £36,900 per month by the end of the year. This expenditure is difficult to control since, although the money is advanced by His Majesty's Government (under the Polish civil credit), the funds are Polish. At the instance of this embassy a number of economies have been effected, but there are probably still some items of extravagance which it is not possible to check. 93. On the 2nd August, 1944, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration took over from Middle East Relief and Rehabilitation Admini stration the handling of the Polish refugees in Persia. These Poles, however, are not war refugees within the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration’s definition of the term; and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration take no financial responsibility for them and, in fact, no responsibility other than that of ultimate repatriation. They are, however, prepared to act (without commitment) in a certain measure as regards transport. Economic Warfare. 94. The necessity for contraband control in Persia has naturally declined during 1944, particularly since the closing of the Balkan route to Switzerland and the occupation of Roumania and Bulgaria. In fact the only enemies with whom the Persians could now trade are specified persons in neutral territory, and such trade is easily prevented by liaison with the British section of the Anglo- Soviet-Persian censorship. Merchants are generally anxious to follow such guidance and warnings as are given to them by the Economic Warfare section of the embassy. 95. On the other hand a number of contraband control prohibitions continue to exist for which the merchant can see no valid justification, e.g., the prohibition of all carpet exports to Switzerland and of lambskins to Turkey. Fortunately the merchants concerned are not politically articulate, and it may be hoped that the end of the war with Germany may soon remove the cause of their complaints; and incidentally of some embarrassment to the embassy, since the Soviet authorities who are in practical control of the frontier with Turkey allow Persian exports to pass which have not been authorised by the Ministry of Economic Warfare. 96. The weeding out of the statutory and black lists in Persia continued during 1944, and by the end of the year both were very small. Some persons remaining on the statutory list have been recommended as eligible for retention after the close of hostilities with Germany owing to their dealings with the German intelligence service. 97. There has been during the year a considerable move by Persians to send financial relief to their relatives in the crumbling fortress of Europe. Accordingly an informal arrangement was made with the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs whereby they identified the beneficiaries and the Economic War fare Section examined each case (in secret liaison with the security authorities) before the censor passed the relevant telegraphic transfer. This arrano-ement has worked smoothly, though some remittances have been disallowed because thebeneficiaries were working for the enemy. In such cases the refusal was accom panied by the grounds for rejection. Relations with India. 98. In response to the Government of India’s invitation a small cultural Emission of three Persian scholars toured India during March and April 1944. They were able to see for themselves the great progress in scientific and industrial matters in India and the richness of Persian culture there. On their return to Tehran they enthusiastically set about the dissemination of the facts and at the end of the year an authoritative and representative Indo-Iranian Cultural Society was inaugurated at a meeting of savants and other persons interested in Indo- Persian culture. 99. The Government of India made a generous offer of eleven valuable scholarships for post-graduate courses in {a) forestry (2); (b) agriculture (4); (c) engineering and technical (3); (d) textile (2); and six at the Aitchison College, Lahore, for younger boys. The selection of candidates by a sub-committee of the society (which includes a member of the British Council) was not completed by the end of the year, but it is hoped that sufficient suitable young men equipped with an adequate knowledge of the English language will be found. 100. Sir Olaf Caroe, Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, and Sir Denys Pilditch, Director of Intelligence, and the Home Department of the Government of India, visited Tehran for a week in June and' discussed problems of mutual interest. Their visit coincided with the climax of Soviet obstructionism, for in spite of strong pressure by His Majesty's Embassy, they were refused permission to fly to Meshed, where the Government of India have large interests, until after their departure for India. 101. Four members of the Indian Defence Consultative Committee travelled to Persia in May to visit the Indian troops here. 102. As the British Council could not furnish enough English teachers to meet the great demand the Government of India carefully_selected four Indian graduate experts to teach English at Meshed (2), Kerman (1) and Yezd (1). On the success of this experiment depends the sending of other Indian teachers to Bushire, Ahwaz, and elsewhere, where the demand would justify the expenditure involved. The reports for the difficult initial month’s work in the three centres are most encouraging. The British Council gave valuable assistance with English text books. 103. The Indian community in the capital, having been purged of its most undesirable elements, is beginning to show a greater interest in the part which its members must play as ambassadors of their country and their change of heart has been shown in the very generous contributions which the community has made to India’s war effort in the form of charitable donations and invest ments in Government of India War Bonds, and also in the excellent arrange ments made in conjunction with the British welfare authorities to entertain Indian troops stationed at Tehran. 104. India’s interest in the expansion of her post-war export trade is shown by the establishment of a Trade Commissioner in Tehran. The first Indian Trade Commissioner is expected to take up his duties in the spring of 1945. Internal Politics and the Majlis. (a) Majlis. 105. At the beginning of the year the elections for the 14th legislative period had not been completed and the Majlis was not in session. The formal opening fixed for the 22nd January was moreover postponed as a result princi pally of the opposition of the Shah who wanted a more subservient Parliament and was apprehensive of what might happen when Seyyid Zia-ed-Din Tabatabai took his seat. It was, however, formally opened on the 26th February. Muhammad Zaghi Assad (Amir Jang) was elected temporary president for the examination of the credentials of the Deputies. Later he was succeeded as president by Seyyid Muhammad Sadigh Tabatabai who continued to be presi dent for the rest of the year. 106. Examination of the credentials of the Deputies occupied much of the time of the Majlis for the first few months. Opposition to Seyyid Zia was strong, but after a full-dress debate, in which the Seyyid’s oratory made a good impres sion, his credentials were passed with a substantial majority by secret ballot.22 Although a number of objections were tabled in the course of the year, the credentials of only three Deputies were definitely rejected. The Deputies concerned were Durri, member for Daragez, and Khoyi and Pishavari, both of Tabriz, whose election was said to have been secured by irregular means. 107. The Tudeh group in the Majlis originally numbered eight, but was-^ reduced in August to seven by the expulsion of one member, Khalatbari, Deputy % for Babul. In October, however, the passing of the credentials for Ovanassian, Deputy for the Northern Armenians and a founder member of the Tudeh, again raised the number of the group to eight. This group published at the end of February its programme for the 14th legislative period. It was a surprisingly moderate programme of reform w^hich might have been produced by any of the progressive elements inside or outside the Majlis. The Tudeh may indeed have started as a genuinely left-wing Persian movement, but its subservience to Soviet influence had become increasingly clear by the end of the year, and the cohesion and well-organised activities displayed throughout the year by its representatives in the Majlis confirmed the belief that the party owed much to Russian influence and support. 108. Other groups or “ fractions ” continued to exist and function in the Majlis but they were more like associations of friends than political parties. Efforts to form an effective Government majority in the Majlis by a coalition of various “ fractions,” however, achieved temporary success towards the end of August when about eighty-five Deputies agreed to combine to support Saed’s reconstituted Cabinet. This coalition survived until October, when the Russian demand for an oil concession caused a crisis which eventually brought about Saed’s resignation, whereupon the coalition of fractions formed to support him began gradually to dissolve. The process of disintegration was accelerated in December by further disagreement among the Deputies over the Millspaugh question. 109. By the end of the year 130 out of the full complement of 136 Deputies had taken their seats in the Majlis, though the credentials of two of their number still remained to be examined. 110. The Majlis passed little legislation during the year, having been preoccupied with the credentials of elected Deputies, the Millspaugh question, intrigues over the composition of Cabinets and the crisis caused by the Russian demand in October for an oil concession. The Chamber had failed 1 by the end of December to approve the Budget for the year 1323 (21st March, 1944. to 20th March, 1945), and adopted the course of financing Government expenditure by Votes on Account. Among the measures passed was article 12 of the Com- pulsory Education Bill providing for increases in teachers’ wages, new school pi emises and facilities for the education of workers; a Bill for an additional credit of 150 million lials for the armv; and a Bill tabled by Dr Musaddio on the 2nd December prohibiting the grant of an oil concession to anv foreign Government or company. ° (b) Internal Politics. 111. Soheily s Cabinet, which had been appointed on the 16th December, 1943, remained in power until the end of the elections when realising it had lost the support of the Majlis, it resigned. Soheily was succeeded by Sa’ed who, on the 26th March, presented the following Cabinet to the Shah : — Prime Minister : Muhammad Sa’ed Maraghe’i. Agriculture : Mahmud Fateh. Commerce and Industry : Amanullah Ardalan. Communications : Hamid Say ah. Education : Sarlashkar Ali Riazi. Finance : Mahmud Nariman. Foreign : Muhammad Sa’id Maraghe’i. Interior : Abdul Hussein Hajhir. Justice : Asadullah Mamaqani. Posts. Telegraphs and Telephones : Abdul Qasim Furuhar. Health : Dr. Qasim Ghani. War : Ibrahim Zand. Without portfolio : Murteza Quli Bayat, Mustafa Adi. The Majlis did not take long to signify its disapproval of this Cabinet. The Deputies wanted more of the young and progressive elements. Much of their opposition was concentrated against Zand, Dr. Ghani and General Riazi, who were thought to be nominees of the Shah. His Majesty’s continued intervention23 in the affairs of the Cabinet, the Majlis and the army had caused increasing resentment. There was a strong feeling in the Majlis that the Shah’s activities should be confined within strictly constitutional limits. At the end of March Sa'ed had only announced his programme and had not ventured to present his Ministers for the approval of the Majlis, and he was obliged a few days later to ^reconstitute his Cabinet. General Riazi, Mahmud Fateh and Mahmud Nariman were dropped. Furuhar became Minister of Finance; Dr. Ghani, Minister of Education; Nasir I’timadi, Minister of Agriculture; and Dr. Saed Malik, Minister of Health. The Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs- remained vacant. The new Cabinet was, however, not greeted with any enthusiasm in the Majlis or the country, and Dr. Ghani had resigned before the end of April. Neverthe less, in the absence of any alternative to Sa’ed, the Majlis gave the new Cabinet a vote of confidence on the 16th April. 112. In May Sa’ed asserted himself sufficiently to admonish the press for its irresponsible virulence and shameless blackmail. He also caused a stir by intro ducing a Bill to apply military law to Government employees and factory workers. The Bill was attacked by the Tudeh as reactionary and was rejected. 113. Criticism of Sa’ed soon began. His detractors said he was weak and reactionary and, owing to his long residence abroad, ignorant of conditions in his own country. Nevertheless in the absence of any general agreement as to who should succeed him, his Cabinet continued precariously in office until the end of August. By then Majlis opinion had decided that the best temporary solution would be for Sa’ed to reshuffle his Cabinet, and he was promised the support of a coalition of eighty-five deputies of the Mihan, Ittehad-i-Milli and Azadi fractions. On the 31st August Sa’ed presented his reconstituted Cabinet to the Shah as follows :— Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs : Muhammad Sa'ed Maraghe’i. Commerce and Industry : Dr. Muhammad Nakhai. Communications : Muhammad Nariman. Education : Baqir Kazimi. Finance: Ali Asghar Zarinkafsh. Interior : Muhammad Sururi. Justice: Allahyar Saleh. Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones : Yusuf Mushar. Health : Dr. Manuchihr Iqbal. War : General Muhammad Hussein Firuz. Without portfolio: Khalil Fahimi. General Muhammad Hussein Firuz, Governor General of Fars, however, refused to accept the Ministry of War, which was left under the charge of Brigadier Abdullah Nidayat, as Acting Minister. 114. The new Cabinet was opposed by the Tudeh who objected to the return of Sa’ed and by the Independents in the Majlis who had not been consulted about its formation. Discussions lasting a fortnight followed before the Cabinet finally obtained its vote of confidence on the 17th September. Although Sa’ed continued to enjoy the support of the coalition majority in the Majlis, the position of his Cabinet remained unstable owing to the opposition of the Tudeh and the Russians and of the Shah who was displeased because none of his nominees were in the Government. 115. A notable feature of political life in Persia during the year was the growth of the power of parties and unions. Labour unions had existed for some time in the Russian occupied zone where they were affiliated with the Tudeh party. Other unions also existed in Isfahan and Khuzistan. In Isfahan the Tudeh and the workers’ union combined caused trouble in April and the Govern ment had to send a strong Governor-General to that town to deal with the situa tion. Agitation was also fomented in Tabriz in July when the Majlis ventured to reject the credentials of a Tudeh sponsored deputy from that district. From the 1st to the 12th August the Tudeh party held its first general conference in Tehran. The conference confirmed the programme of moderate constitutional reform adopted by its representatives in the Majlis in February. Other resolutions passed confirmed the hostility of the party to Seyyid Zia and to all foreign advisers, and to the grant of economic concessions “ which constrict or weaken the economic independence of the Persian nation.' Labour unions affiliated to the Tudeh played a large part in the demonstrations and street disturbances organised by that party in Tehran, Tabriz, Isfahan and other towns in October and November, as a result of the refusal of the Persian Government to grant the oil24 % concession to Russia. The Tudeh had indeed so clearly revealed itself as an instrument of Russian policy by the end of the year that it had become seriously discredited in the eyes of the public. Other parties, such as the Hamrahan, the “ Adalat, and the Mardum were of little importance. But oeyyid Zia was reported to be making progress with the foundation of a party of his own, by a process of forming circles of “ progressive elements throughout the country. ^ 116. Seyyid Zia’s vigorous personality was throughout this period a source* of constant provocation to the Tudeh and the Russians who could ne&gt;t get out (if their heads the theory that he was a creature of the British. His relations with the Shah, which at first were extremely bad, gradually improved. Increasing fear of Soviet penetration in the north niay have driven the Shah to the conclusion that he might before long need the strong personality of Seyyid Zia to stand up to the Russians. After several interviews the Shah and Seyyid Zia were believed to have reached a considerable measure of agreement b^ the end of August, but nothing further had come of the apparent reconciliation by the end of the year 117. The Persian Government’s rejection in October of the Russian demand for an oil concession precipitated a crisis which brought about Sa’ed's resignation. Although Sa'ed clearlv had the support of public opinion and of a growing section of the press, the Majlis decided finally that he should go, as a sop to the Russians. Sa’ed therefore resigned on the 10th November. The various Majlis fractions thereupon went into conclave to choose a successor, but it was not until the 20 th November that Murteza Quli Bay at was elected Prime Minister with fifty votes against forty-five given to Sadiq Sadiqi. ^ ^ ^ . 118. On the 25th November Bayat presented the following Cabinet to the Shah :— Prime Minister : Murteza Quli Bayat. Foreign : Muhsin Rais. Commerce and Industry : Kamal Hidayat. Communications : Nasrullah Intizam. Education : Dr. Issa Sadiq. Finance : Amanullah Ardalan. Interior : Muhammad Sururi. War : Ibrahim Zand. Justice : Mustafa Adi. Health : Dr. Said Malik. Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones : Nadir Arasteh. Without portfolio : Khalil Fahimi, Ali Akbar Siasi. Muhsin Rais, Persian Ambassador at Baghdad, having refused the portfolio of Foreign Affairs, Nasrullah Intizam was appointed to the post. Two of the new Ministers, Khalil Fahimi, Minister without portfolio, and Sururi Minister of . the Interior, had held the same posts in Sa’ed's Government. On the whole, the Cabinet was considered a fairly good one. Discussion on the new Government s programme was concluded on the 4th December and Bayat received a vote o confidence by a majority of seventy-two to nine with sixteen abstentions. The Press and Public Relations. 119. The tone of the press during the past year was, on the whole, more favourable to the Allies. This may be ascribed largely to their improved fortunes on the battle-front. As the end of the war drew nearer, there was a growing tendency to emphasise Persia’s claims at the Peace Conference and to urge the Government to draw up Persia’s case. 120. Towards the end of the year the press crystallised into two, at least temporarily, clearly defined groups; the so-called Freedom Front and the Indepen dence Front. In addition to this were a few neutral papers. The former group is comprised of those papers run by the Tudeh party and their sympathisers and is under Russian influence. Many of the papers belonging to this group are in all probability financed directly or indirectly by Russian sources. Their columns are largely occupied by diatribes against capitalism and reaction and more recently against “ international imperialists.” and to some extent by Marxist dialectics. The troubles in Greece gave them an opportunity to attack British policy, which they were not slow to seize. Similarly, the oil crisis in the autumn also caused strong support of the Russians and violent attacks on the Government, the ruling classes and the “ agents of reaction and imperialism.” This, however, did much to discredit these papers in the eyes of the public. 121. The Independence Front came into existence in December, largely as a result of the oil crisis. The papers belonging to this group, together with a number of papers supporting Seyyid Zia, took a strong line over the oil crisis25 and asserted that Russian intimidation was an unwarranted interference m the internal affairs of the country. • p T3 • 122. From time to time there were fulsome articles in praise of Russia, such as the occasion of the formation of the Irano-Soviet Cultural Relations Society, but there is little doubt that fear of Russian intentions towards Persia increased with growing rapidity. In proportion, as the attitude towards Russia, ^ deteriorated so did the attitude towards Great Britain improve. I he oil crisis induced certain papers to stand up to Russia. To their surprise they found they were not visited immediately with some terrible punishment. I he result has been that a juster balance has been observed in the allocation by the press and public of blame among Allies for Persia’s ills. 123. There was a growing tendency from the summer onwards to accuse the United States of having imperialist designs in Persia and the Middle East, 124. In internal affairs the press showed itself extremely sensitive to any supposed attack on its freedom or to any attempt to establish control over it. Any measures which were thought to be a reversion to the dictatorship and its methods were also violently attacked. The general tone towards internal affairs has been one of pessimism. The governing classes were persistently accused of corruption and incapability. 125. The Millspaugh mission was virulently attacked by the Freedom Front papers and the majority of neutral papers. Its only support came from a number of Independence Front papers and papers supporting Seyyid Zia. Tribal Situation. 126. The tribes have remained comparatively peaceful during 1944 having been allowed, in a large measure, to manage their own affairs. 1 he Government, perhaps as the result of three years of pressure by this embassy, has at least condescended to recognise that among the people of Persia, for whose welfare they are responsible, are tribal communities—outlandish barbarians in the opinion of most of the Ministers—whose way of life requires special consideration. A Tribal Commission was formed composed of two Ministers without portfolio and two tribal Deputies, one from the Bakhtiari and one from the Kurds. This commission in turn recommended the formation of a Tribal Affairs Department in the Ministry of the Interior which was to have branches in all the provinces. However, as the result of the successful conclusion of some very minor operations for disarming some of the weaker and more accessible tribes and, as time passed by without any serious uprising, the Persian Government’s fear of, and interest in, the tribes declined and the commission ceased to function and finally disintegrated with that imperceptible decay so common to Persian institutions. Seyyid Zia also, with the object of gaining tribal support, made known his sympathy with the neglect and oppression tribes had suffered in recent years, and his views that they merited much greater consideration from the Government and that they should be allowed to retain their arms to protect themselves against oppres sion until thev were assured of just administration. This put the Tudeh party, always in opposition to Seyyid Zia, in a difficult position. They had themselves for political purposes been championing the cause of the tribes, but their hostility to Seyyid Zia obliged them to cry loudly against what they alleged was incitement of the tribes to rearm and oppose the Government. 1 he Shah, too, was disturbed by the thought that Seyyid Zia was trying to secure the support of the tribes with a view to using them to bring off a coup d'Etat as the Bakhtiari had done some decades before. For a time it seemed that he was himself going to make a bid for popularity among the tribes, but he seems to have reverted to his father’s idea that they must be disarmed as soon and as ruthlessly as possible and kept in a state of weakness lest they became a dangerous instrument in the hands of foreigners or schemers against the throne. The pact of friendship between Qavam-ul-Mulk and Nasir Qashgai, later joined by Murteza Quh Khan Bakhtiari, has contributed to peace by removing, for a time at least some of the causes of unrest which lay in long-standing mutual antagonisms This pac has been represented as an alliance of the tribes of the south and Tudeh press has been loud in proclaiming that this is a sinister move by Persian reactionaries and their masters to form an imperialistic zone of influence in the south. 127 Affairs worthy of note in the various tribal zones may be summaiised as follows (a) Bakhtiari.—Some discontent is becoming evident with the rather 'bitrary government of Murteza Quli Khan, who, in spite of his protestations [64—52] E ar26 to the contrary, appears to be reverting to the customs of the days of Ilkhani rule, the return of which would be hardly more welcome to the tribesmen than the return of the military regime of Reza Shah’s days. Murteza Quli Khan is reported to be levying on the tribe the old taxes levied by the Ilkhams and abolished by Reza Shah. Moreover, he is departing from a well-established custom of the old days when the lucrative posts in tribal administration were evenly distributed between the two rival branches of the ruling family. Now ^ only his own relatives get these opportunities, and the disgruntled Khans of the ^ other branch heartily encourage all the discontent they can find. (b) Qashgai .—With the handing over of the Germans and of Naubakht our relations with the Qashai diminished in importance. Nasir Khan has still failed to make his submission to the Persian Government in the person of the Shah but has had frequent contacts with the Governor-General of Pars and His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz. He hankers after but has not yet been given the title of “ Rais-i-Intizimat ” (chief administrator) which is the furthest the Persian Government were prepared to go in recognising his position as head of the Qashgai. On the whole the tribe has been quiet, occasional acts of robbery serve as a reminder that brigandage is endemic in tars. (c) Kuh-i-Galu .—On the borders of the northern oil field area in Khuzestan the Bahmai tribe of Kuhgali has been indulging in some minor raiding. Earlier in the year plans had been made by the local Persian commanders for the disarmament of this tribe and the western Janeki tribe, but at the last moment fears that the Bahmai might be supported by other Kuhgalu tribes modified the plan, and only the Janeki lost some arms. It is through their territory that the Bahmai are now raiding, and the Janeki plead their disarma ment as justification for being unable to prevent them. A delicately balanced situation exists between the conflicting sections of the Boir Ahmadi. Both sides are wearying of the tension and showing a tendency to come to terms. Whether this will be to the benefit of their neighbours, only time will show. There has certainly been less than the usual Boir Ahmad raiding since the tribes were occupied in sparring with each other. (d) Khuzestan .—A measure of the disarmament of the Arab tribes has been effected and continues. After some 1,000 rifles had been collected from the Arabs of the Ahu Dasht area the Persian troops turned their attention to the Beni Turuf who, with opposition from only a small section who fled to Iraq, surrendered some 1,300 rifles. The Beni Tamim have now begun to hand in their arms. Further operations have been successfully undertaken between Ahwaz and Bandar Shahpur, east of Ahwaz near Khalafabad and on Abadan Island. (e) Kurdistan .—The tribal situation in Southern Kurdistan has on the whole remained remarkably quiet. In August, however, the Persian Govern ment conducted an operation against Hama Rashid of Baneh, who had rebelled against them in 1942 and had wrested from them a settlement leaving him in effective control of his district. For some time past some Persian authorities had held the view that his position was a dangerous encouragement to Kurdish aspirations. This embassy’s advice was that any measure against him should be combined with concrete evidence of an intention to provide benefits for the Kurdish tribes. Hama Rashid, however, played into the hands of the Govern ment by attacking a neighbouring village. The Government thereupon despatched a column against him as a result of which Baneh and Sardasht were occupied with little opposition and Hama Rashid driven from Persian territory. He has now been removed from the vicinity of the frontier by the Iraqi authorities. Most of the chiefs of this area have made their peace, for the time being, with the Persian authorities, and if the Persians were capable of just administration and a consistent policy they would now have the opportunity of relieving Kurdish fears and laying the foundation of a permanent settlement. In North Kurdistan the situation is not easy to describe. It is known that the Russians are in close touch with the Kurds and have not permitted any offensive measures, and disarmament operations or even free movement to the few small garrisons of Persian troops allowed to be stationed in Azarbaijan. The Russians, or rather the Russian-controlled Tudeh party, have close contacts with the Kurds and fifteen notables of the Shakkaq tribe were invited to the recent Tudeh conference in Tabriz. It is probably true to say that the Kurds have no real affinity with the Russians and realise that a separationist move ment in Azarbaijan, culminating possibly in a republic under Soviet control, would hold out no especial benefit for them (their object being Kurdish autonomy); but they would stand to benefit from a complete breakdown of Persian Government authority in Azarbaijan following the withdrawal of[64—&gt;52] F 27 Russian troops and are watching the situation without committing themselves too deeply. Tribal Lunds. 128. Early in February the Persian Ministry of Justice prepared a com- ^plicated but comprehensive plan for the formation of sub-committees of three to examine and decide the many long-outstanding claims of individual tribesmen and their chieftains to lands which had been forcibly seized from them,^ and exchanged or merely requisitioned and sold to third parties, during the regime ■ of Reza Shah. Though no case has yet been completed, the wo*rk is progressing and it would seem that the Persian Government genuinely wish to settle once and for all these claims which have remained a festering sore in the country. The policy of His Majesty’s Embassy has been to refrain from sponsoring any individual claim but to press for the early settlement of them all by means of these sub-committees. Persian Army. 129. 1944 has not been a year of great progress for the Persian army but, . ' on balance, at the close of it they are materially better off and morally no worse off than at its beginning. The defects and shortcomings are the same as those noted in previous reviews and will persist until the microbe of perverted individualism is eliminated from the Persian system. 130. A lack of continuity in direction has always been a weakness in Persian military affairs and four changes in the post of Minister of M ar and five changes in that of the Chief of the General Staff have resulted in much shuffling of posts and bewilderment among the subordinate officials. Ihere is still no clear-cut division of responsibilities as between the Minister for War and the Chief of the General Staff and, even if their functions were to be clearly defined, the intervention of H.I.M. the Shah, either through that unnecessary body, his military Cabinet, or directly as titular commander-in-chief, through the Chief of the General Staff, produces confusion and opens the door to backstairs intrigues. 131. The close of the year finds the post of Minister for War occupied by Ibrahim Zand, a patriotic and honest man with background of military training in the Russia of Tsarist days. He has sound ideas of eliminating corruption in the army but lacks the courage to enforce his will against such formidable odds. 132. The present Chief of the General Staff is General Hassan Arfa, an officer of undoubted courage, energy and patriotism. His rough manner, excitable temperament, his violent likes and dislikes, his suspicious nature and his record, not entirely blameless as regards peculation, low'er his respect in the army and diminish his chance of success. He has a lively fear of Russian designs and^ although inclined to be xenophobic, is not, at present, unfriendly to us. Though he recognises the weaknesses in the Shah’s character, he worships him as Shah and the present danger is that his ebullient nationalism and his fanatical belief that an army commanded by the Shah and controlled by himself is invincible may lead him and his royal master into rash enterprises and trials of strength with the tribes in which, at their present level of training, equipment and administration, they are likely to come off the losers. 133. The army still suffers from shortage of funds and still lives from hand to mouth on doles of one-twelfth or two-twelfths of the military budget which the Majlis periodically sanctions and which a Treasury, said to be nearly empty, doles out with reluctance and the maximum of delay. 134. Out of the original budget for 1,530 million rials the Director-General of Finances has only sanctioned 1,000 million rials. An extra allotment of 150 million rials to be found from Government profits on the sale of monopoly goods, though sanctioned, has not yet been received. 135. The officer cadre of the Persian army is riven by internal dissensions. Many belong to so-called political parties—not political parties as we understand the term, but mutable combinations of crooks banded together to further some , intrigue or obtain some temporary advantage. Many attach themselves to some patron from whom they expect to derive personal advancement. 136. Some of the junior officers and warrant officers have been receptive . objects of Russian propaganda. Their low rates of pay, their slow rates of pro motion, their inability to rise under the dead weight of sloth, corruption and ignorance of their seniors have been pointed out to them with, it is said, some effect.28 137. Indiscipline among all ranks of officers attains serious proportio . The recipient of an unpalatable order will evade it by mahngering, procias i &lt; tion or bribery; or, if these methods fail, obtain the support of a Majlis Deputy to air his grievances. In the last resort he may purchase the vituperative skill of a journalist, who will pour out in his columns such a torrent of slander on the author of the order that he will be glad to rescind the ordei m 0,( 11 1 ‘ C relief. • i 138. To dissipate the gloom of this picture of the Persian army there are some bright features. . , . , * , • 139. The American military mission has obtained some much-needed equip ment, chiefly medical stores, clothing, boots, and 600 trucks. Two further long lists of stores have been forwarded to the United States. . „ , 140. The mission has laid down a rudimentary organisation tor the issue, control and maintenance of military transport and a system of supply depots which will check the widespread misappropriation of stores at the centre, hut. because control ceases as soon as issues leave the depots, will not eliminate petty peculation by commanders of units. A scheme for centralised recruit trainmg a divisional centres instead of in regiments met with such opposition that it had to be abandoned. . . ,. 141. As a result of certain successful minor operations to disarm the tribes, of which particulars are given under the Tribal Affairs Section, the morale of the troops has improved, and provided that the General Staff refrain from operations beyond their means, this improvement should continue as the memories ot the inglorious collapse before the British and Russian tioops in August 1 • grow dimmer. ■,. • 142 Stalin’s tanks and aircraft have never materialised. The conditions subsequently attached to the offer stipulated that the units of mixed Russia*! and Persian personnel which were to be formed for the purpose of training m these arms were to be under the command of Soviet officers, who were themselves to be under the command of the Red army; that the Persian personnel were to be selected with the approval of the Russian commander, and that the units were not to be removed from their appointed places of training (Meshed and Kazvin), nor could the material be used for any other purpose without the approval ot the Red army. These conditions were too full of alarming possibilities to be accept able to the Persian Government, who replied that they would accept the material gladly—without conditions. The offer was thereupon angrily withdrawn. Persian Gendarmerie. 143. In the gendarmerie, as in the army, plans for improvement are held up bv lack of funds. The credit demanded by Colonel Schwarzkopf for the modified organisation he had in view for the current year, that is, eighteen regiments of gendarmerie with a total strength of 28,000—the number he considers to be reallv necessary is 40,000—amounted to 600 million rials. 1 he amount allotted in the budget by Dr. Millspaugh is 290 million rials, which is the bare cost of ten regiments at the increased rates of pay; these rates are, in fact, the minimum at which officers and men can be expected to refrain from partnership with brigands and thieves. Even among gendarmerie officers the opinion is forming that in the present financial and economic situation of the country the interests of internal security would be better served by devoting the available resources to the army and the police. Colonel Schwarzkopf’s insistence that the gendarmerie should be independent of the army has accentuated the lack of co-operation that became immediately evident when the force passed from the control of the Ministry of War to that of the Interior. 144. Colonel Schwarzkopf’s mission has now been completed to the maximum strength of six officers sanctioned by the United States. Although Colonel Schwarzkopf has extensive powers it is obvious that six officers can exercise no very effective influence over the actions of personnel scattered in small packets over an area of 628,000 square miles, and consequently in the provinces gendar merie shows no improvement as the result of Colonel Schwarzkopf’s eighteen months’ hard work. 145. Encouraged by some Deputies and other influential persons who would like to see the gendarmerie established in a more important position than the army, he aims at an organisation which he estimates would require three years to build 5 up and whose cost would be justifiable only if the army were reduced to a small striking force. However desirable that might be, it does not seem to be realisable in the near future; and it is the efficiency of the gendarmerie in the near future that is of primary interest to us. Towards that very little progress is29 evident. But it is reasonable to expect that Colonel Schwarzkopf's energy and drive will produce results in time. Handicapped, as he is by inadequate iun s inadequate American staff, the lack of any co-ordinated policy on the part ot tne Government and an unwillingness on his part to admit that the best may times be the enemy of the good, he could perhaps not fairly be expec e o effected much improvement in an organisation as demoralised, as lethargic ana as ^uninspired by any laudable ideal as the Persian gendarmene. Persian Air Force. 146. The fighting value of the Persian Air Force remains as it was a year ago—virtually negligible. During the second half of 1944 no fuel was aval a e and flying was brought to a standstill. In the air therefore the force 18 P 1 *? ^ even worse than it was, though a short conversion course on Ansons which was given to ten pilots in Egypt in the summer did some good. On the ground stea ) , Though very slow, progress under Royal Air Force guidance has been made w th the maintenance of airframes and engines, but the continued loss of semoi technical non-commissioned officers to civilian employment is a grave handicap. 147 The fifteen Ansons supplied by His Majesty s Government in excha g for ten Mohawks taken over in 1941 were delivered m August. Tsow that the Persian Air Force at last has some fuel and can fly them they should prove increasingly useful for operational and communications purposes. 148. Sarlashkar Hassein Firuz, who was commanding the Air Force at the beginning of the year left it to become Governor-General of Pars m the earl} summer ° He was succeeded by Sarlashkar Ahmad Kakhchevan, a very semoi officer who had built up the Force in the 1930’s, but whose prestige was greater than his energy. He paid a formal visit to the United Kingdom m November, partly in connexion with a scheme for training his Air Force on Hurricanes, but he had hardly left this country when he was replaced by Sartip Ahmad Khosrovani, another Air Force officer, who had, however, not been employed m the Air Force since 1941 but who was a friend of the L nder-Secretai y of ^ ai and had suddenly become available on his expulsion by the Russians from Tabuz where he had been commanding troops. Sartip Khosrovani is showing commend able energy in his command, but his ideas about most things are out of date^ Sarlashka^ Nakhchevan, whose training scheme fell with him was offered but declined the post of Inspector-General of the Air Force and left almost at once on an official visit to America where he still is. Civil A irlines in Persia. 149. During the year the Iranian State Airline has continued its lehran- Bao-dad service. Following the delivery in the autumn of two of fj 16 tir o e Hominies ordered from the United Kingdom by the Ministry of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones the frequency has been increased to a nominal twice ■&gt; in each direction. The airline is operating from Mehrabad airfield under Royal Air Force control with crews seconded from the Persian Air Force, who are trying with some success to conform to present-day airfield and control procedure The third Dominie met with a minor accident on its delivery flight at the end of the year but is expected in Tehran shortly. An experimental service from Tehran to Isfahan, Shiraz and Bushire was run once or twice m the summer but was not established owing to shortage of aircraft It may soon be revived. 150. Durino , ‘ the summer a group of prominent Persians formed a eompan} which is seeking^ the monopoly of air transport within the country Part of their scheme may be also to take over the existing postal service to Bagdad. Sarlashkar Nakhchevan is acting as technical adviser and the moving spnit is G H Ibtihai the present Mayor of Tehran. The company professes to be , anxious to work with British interests, particularly the British Overseas Airways Corporation, and some of its members are genuine in this. There is, however reason to believe that Ibtihaj himself is at the same time in close touch with the Americans. The company has yet to secure formal acceptance of its proposals bv the Government. , ^ ^ • , ' * 151 T p e frequency of the British Overseas Airway Corporation service to Bagdad Damascus and Cairo was increased in the summer to thrice weekly in each direction. It runs to capacity, the small space left over after meeting official demands being readily taken up by non-official passengers and freight. 152. In the spring the Russians began, to carry non-Soviet passengers tor navment on their military aircraft plying between Meshed, Tabriz and Pahlevi and the capital. This led the Persian Government to issue a circular to the [64—52] , ' F 2 mmmmmforeign missions saying that they did not “ allow ' any Power to use the internal air services and that as soon as aircraft ordered in the United Kingdom and the United States arrived the Persian Government would reorganise all air services. Finance. ' 153. The budgetary deficit for the year 1943-44 (ending on the^ 20th March, 1944) was 1,052 million rials, as against 7,500 million in the preceding year. Of the two budgets, the ordinary and commercial, into which the main budget is divided, the ordinary showed a small surplus while the deficit on the commercial budget was 1,214 million rials. This deficit was due partly to the necessity for subsidising food-stuffs, and partly to the wasteful and often corrupt management of the Government factories. For the current financial year, the estimates laid before the Majlis last June (but even now not yet approved by them) showed both the ordinary and commercial budgets practically in balance, with a small surplus on both taken together of 470,000 rials. 154. The actual out-turn for the first nine months of the year up to the 21st December, 1944, shows a net deficit of 219 million rials as compared with 837 million for the same period last year. The situation, however, is less favour able than it appears, partly because the salaries of Government servants have been allowed to run one month in arrear, but mainly because the receipts from income tax, the rates of which were increased from the beginning of the year, are likely to be much below the optimistic estimate. It is not possible at the present stage to give any reliable estimate of the final out-turn; but it would appear that if the ordinary budget is to be balanced it will only be done by severe economies in expenditure, although it is difficult to see where (apart from the army) economies on a sufficient scale can be made without grave detriment to the public services. The out-turn of the commercial budget will depend mainly on the stocks of food-stuffs held at the end of the year and the cost of subsidies. The Government have reached their statutory limit for borrowing from the National Bank; and both the Minister for Finance and Dr. Millspaugh realise that the position generally is very far from satisfactory. 155. There was a slight check in the inflationary process at the time of the favourable war news towards the end of the summer, but it has been only temporary. Thus the figures of note circulation, which were 5,515 million rials in January and 6,262 in June, were 6,640 in December; while bank deposits which were 6,103 million in January and 8,753 in June, were 9,003 in December. Wholesale prices which were 498 in January rose to 534 (August), declined to 442 (October) and were 497 in December. The cost of living figure was 772 in January, rose to 855 (August), decreased to 656 (November) and was 684 in December (for both indices 1939 = 100). Although the price indices were rather higher in December than in November, it is reasonable to expect that there will be a further fall from now onwards, although it is to be hoped that it will be gradual. 156. A Persian delegation headed by M. Ibtihaj, Governor of the National Bank, attended the Middle East Financial Conference, which was held in Cairo during April. With the other delegations, it subscribed to the resolutions of the conference calling upon the countries concerned {a) to balance their budgets (b) to absorb surplus purchasing power by taxation, internal loans and savings and {c) to ensure the progressive reduction of prices. In the case of Persia, however, this was more easily said than done. Dr. Millspaugh fully saw the measures required to bring its finances into order, but he was faced on the one hand by the native inertia, and on the other by widespread and organised obstruction on the part of the more prosperous classes with a view to avoiding- payment of direct taxation. Moreover, it is almost impossible to raise an internal Government loan in Persia owing to the high rates of interest current in the country generally. 157. Dr. Millspaugh's difficulties (described in greater detail earlier in this despatch) naturally interfered both with day-to-day admiifistration and with the urgent work of post-war planning. As long ago as last June he was proposing to set up a series of inter-locking committees composed of Persians and members of his American staff to study the various post-war problems. Instead, however, the Government decided a few months later to set up a “ Supreme Economic Council ” of twenty-four members (Persians only) for this purpose; the Council, however, disintegrated after a few meetings. 158. Sales of gold on behalf of His Majesty’s Government continued throughout the year. The amount sold since sales were begun in June 1943 up to the 31st December, 1944, has been £6-6 million. Although these sales have31 imam + _ 4 been of little effect in combating the inflationary movement in Persia, they enabled His Majesty's Government to acquire rials for military expenditure at a lower rate than that laid down in the Anglo-Persian financial agreement. Recently, however, it appeared that, the market in Persia having reached saturation point, the gold was being smuggled into Iraq and the proceeds were returning in the form of dinar notes. Since this results in an increase in tlie -^sterling balances of the Persian Government and since under the financial agree ment 60 per cent, of the increase in such balances must be converted by His Majesty’s Government into gold, it was decided (after the end of the year under review) that sales should be discontinued. 159. The financial agreement with the Persian Government covering the operation of the Persian railway system by the Allies has not yet been signed, or even presented to the Government, although the railways were taken over as long ago as September 1941. Its preparation was delayed for some time as it was expected that the United States Government would be a party to it. When they decided that they would not, the draft was placed before the Soviet Government in order that that Government and His Majesty's Government might agree a text to be presented jointly to the Persians. Tne draft was given to the Soviet Government some months ago, but although some small points of difference have been settled it has so far proved impossible to obtain their approval of it. It seems probable that the delay is deliberate. In the meantime the difference between expenditure and receipts is being made up by His Majesty’s Government. 160. Lists of the fixed installations and other capital assets which will not be required by the British and United States military authorities on their evacuation of Persia are being prepared for presentation to the Persian Govern ment with a view to their purchase by that Government or by private individuals; although the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company may be given first refusal of those items which they require. Both His Majesty's Government and the United States Government are in agreement that these assets shall not be transferred to the Persian Government without payment as it is fairly clear that the Government have hoped, if not expected; and that if reasonable offers are refused demolitions will be carried out in order to make it clear that the two Governments remain unmoved by Persian protestations. In the meantime it is understood that the Persian Government are preparing (with the help of an American engaged for this purpose) a comprehensive list of claims against the United Nations for financial compensation in respect of damage or alleged damage caused to Persia as the result of its ‘ ‘ sacrifices ’ ’ in the Allied cause. 161. The Bretton Woods Conference in July was attended by Persian representatives. The contribution of Persia to the stabilisation fund was fixed at twenty-five million dollars, and its contribution to the capital of the bank at twenty-four million dollars. These contributions have not yet been ratified by the Majlis, but it is understood that the then Persian Prime Minister authorised a token payment to be made. Economic Situation. 162. In spite of the various political disturbances during the year that have had as their setting the economic administration of the country or have related directly to important aspects of Persia’s economy, the period under review has been one of steady progress in supply and organisation. Such troubles as were encountered arose from the normal instability of the Persian character (which hates to leave even a good thing alone for long) aggravated by pressure from outside. If the economic picture is cleansed of the blemishes caused by the opposition to the work of the Millspaugh Mission, the insolvency of the Government, side issues such as the conflict between Dr. Millspaugh and M. A. H. Ibtihaj, Governor of the National Bank, discussions in the body of the mission, and finally the upheaval following the rejection of the Soviet oil demands, it leaves a view of a country in a greatly improved position compared with the breadless days of 1942 or the chaotic periods of 1943. The Tehran silo is full of grain; agricultural prospects are good; stocks of essential commodities are sufficient for many months (though distribution, greatly improved over last year, still leaves much to be desired); and rail and road transport is no longer the bottleneck it was in the past just after the Allies began to send supplies to Russia across Persia. 163. This satisfactory state of affairs is the culmination of over two years’ hard work by the Anglo-American civil and military authorities in Persia. The Millspaugh Mission has in 1944 been the facade behind which many Americans and British have done excellent work in almost every important aspect of Persian32 economy. British officers and civilians have played an important part m cereals collection and the organisation of road transport. 164. Soviet commercial activities were considerable. The Soviet authorities have never co-operated with the other Allies in supplying Persia on a govern mental basis with her essential requirements. Nevertheless large quantities oi such goods were imported from the Soviet l nion and sold by the Soviet Trade^ Delegation on the open market. Sugar and cotton piece goods formed the bulk o.^ such imports. The rials obtained in this way were used to buy rice, cattle, sheep, small arms and ammunition made in the Tehran arsenals and other Persian pro ducts required by the Soviet Union, and doubtless also to finance other Soviet activities (e.g., subsidies to the Tudeh party and certain newspapers). Soviet survey parties have been active in the central area (Dasht-i-Kavir), and are believed to have been prospecting for oil and other minerals. Cereals and Agricultural Development. 165. Failure of the rain and snow-fall of the winter of 1943-44 caused grave apprehensions at the beginning of the year, and there was the prospect of a bread and transport crisis in the Spring. Only the active intervention of the Middle East Supply Centre, with the loan of twenty British officers for a Cereals Collec tion team, and of the British and American Military Authorities, with transport (17,000 tons of wheat were moved from the Hamadan/Kermanshah area to the Persian railway for Tehran) saved the situation. The grain stocks in the Tehran silo and in store-rooms elsewhere in the country were gradually built up, and at the end of the year there were 260,000 tons of flour-grain in store including 53,000 tons in the silo at Tehran, enough for 265 days' supply to the city. This result was attained only by hard relentless work of the cereals control (Department of Agricultural Monopolies) organised by Dr. Black of the Millspaugh Mission. The Soviet authorities were much less helpful, but they did allow grain to come to Tehran from the north, except during the oil crisis when they maliciously cut off supplies for about twenty days. The excellent fall of snow in December removed all fears of a serious water-shortage and failure of crops in 1945. The Government of India sold 1,000 tons of seed-wheat for use in the Persian Culf area where dearth of rain necessitated this valuable assistance. Similarly the Government of India agreed to take wheat and barley from the Zabul (Seistan) area of East Persia and to supply an equivalent value of wheat-flour in the Persian Gulf. The bargain was not fully implemented by the Persians who, owing to internal maladministration and greed of local officials, were unable to persuade the Zabul cultivators to release the full 4,000 tons of wheat and barley. 166. Various projects for the development of agriculture in the country, chiefly by the construction of irrigation works, have been under consideration by the central government. Requests for supplies of machinery and other equip ment for these projects have led to the deputation by the Middle East Supply Centre of two experts to enquire into the soundness of the schemes and the need for the plant demanded. Such investigation is very necessary in order to prevent the initiation of unsound projects whose failure would cause disappointment and make Persians sceptical about other projects. It has been impressed on pro moters of such schemes that it is essential that expert opinion should be obtained before any project is initiated. Transport. 167. The Millspaugh Mission assumed charge of the Road Transport Administration in February, with a team of British and American officers to assist in the control of vehicles in the provinces and the issue of tyres. With the release by the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation in the summer of contracted lorries engaged on “ Aid to Russia,” the Road Transport Administration were able to reinforce their fleet considerably and to relax to some extent the restrictions on the use of certain classes of lorries. The Soviet Transport organisation Iransovtrans in July began to compete against the Road Transport Administra tion for the carriage of civil goods in Isfahan, Kerman and other towns outside the Soviet “ zone ” (regardless of the Government “ monopoly '). Otherwise there were few hitches in the progressive improvement of vehicle control and operation. The arrival in the country of some hundreds of new vehicles and a large consign ment of spare parts helped to maintain this position. Tyre supplies, however, were scarcely adequate for the country's needs. No passenger cars and only a small quantity of tyres for passenger cars were received, and the Government complained that the shortage of this type of vehicle hindered the administration.33 Nevertheless, no effort was made to requisition private cars, with which Tehran is, by the war standards of the United Kingdom, incredibly well supplied. 168. Kail transport functioned smoothly; and generous quantities of civil goods and cereals were carried to Tehran, northwards in spite of the demands of ££ Aid to Russia ” supplies, and southwards from the Soviet ££ zone. Oil stocks ^were adequate. For a short while, in December, the unexpectedly heayy civil demand caused some anxiety, but it was found that the increase was genuine, being due to the great increase in the use of oil instead of coal or wood for heating and cooking. Tt The prospects for British trade. 169. With the end of the war in sight almost all the principal merchants in the country turned their attention to the possibilities of trade with Great Britain. There is no doubt that as long as Persia s supply of sterling lasts it will be possible to export to Persia anything that l nited Kingdom exporters can offer in the way of woollen and cotton piece-goods and yarns, dyes, chemicals, vehicles, machinery for irrigation and agricultural use, power generation, &amp;c., faetoiy equipment of many kinds, building materials, domestic utensils, pottery, clothing, footwear, bicycle lamps, ironmongery and haberdashery of all kinds, and a host of capital and consumption goods. We shall in fact have to decide what kinds of goods we can best spare, and endeavour to steer demand towards them and away from the goods we do not wish to export. Engineering services and other kinds of technical help would be one of the best ways of providing Persia with what mic needs and at the same time of maintaining British influence in this country. A useful step in that direction has been the signing of an agreement between the Ministry of Agriculture and Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners for the survey of an irrigation and hydro-electric project in the Ear valley, in the vicinity ol Tehran. Another agreement reached by the same firm with the Tehran muni cipality for the preparation of plans for a proper water supply and sewei age system in the capital is being obstructed by the Minister of the Interior on a legal technicality. . . . 170. The development of trade between Great Britain and Persia will depend very largely on the exchange situation. Persia is outside the sterling aiea, but the rial is not a ££ hard currency. It is doubtful whether there is an} ad\an~ tao’e to be gained from increasing trade between the sterling area and Persia be\ ond the amount represented by the latter's sterling balances and the £5 million odd per annum represented by Anglo-Iranian Oil Company royalties and the proceeds ot Persian exports (carpets, gums, dried fruits, nuts, opium, oxides) to the sterling area. If Persia had industrial raw materials other than oil to export the position would be different. On the other hand, we have in the shape of the Anglo-Iraman Oil Company’s concession a valuable stake in the country, and for that and foi political reasons connected with the position of Persia in relation to India and the Middle East it is necessary for Great Britain to ensure that her influence m this country is at least as great as that of any other foreign country. It may, therefore, be advantageous in the end to promote trade with Persia, especially of a kind that brings British nationals to work in this country, even if the exchange advantages are not all we could desire. Locust Control. ' * 171. It had been expected that the control of the desert locust {i.e., migra tory) in 1944 would call for considerable efforts, not only by the Persian Plant Defence Department but also by the British military units and the Ro\al Air Force Anti-Locust Flight, which were stationed on the coastal plain between Jiwani and Lingeh ready to deal with swarms arriving from India and Arabia. 172. By March the consistently reassuring reports from both these countries had led the British Locust Officer in Persia to decide on the withdrawal of the Royal Air Force Anti-Locust Flight. The organisation in the Jiwani area was also greatly reduced and the area was placed under the control of India entomo logists, mainly for observation purposes. i n p 173 Unfortunately, several swarms, borne on high winds from West Arabia, did after all, reach Persia during March and the British ground forces were not sufficiently forewarned or mobile to attack these adults before they passed inland beyond the coastal plain. However, only one of the swarms laid eggs on Persian soil (in Laristan) and the resulting hoppers were effectively destroyed by the Persian control organisation, while the parent swarm and other invading\ 34 bands flew eastwards towards Baluchistan and Afghanistan without further oviposition in Persia. _ 174. In addition, during March and during April and May, the I ersian Plant Defence Department were fully occupied with the control of the Moroccan {i.e., non-migratory) locust both in the interior (Pars and Lauristan) and in the Caspian provinces (Azerbaijan and Gurgan). Their campaigns were successful^ in the interior, where they provided all materials from their own resources, but they were seriously delayed in the north by the non-arrival of oilcake-meal, which they had expected to buy from the Soviet Union, and by their inability to make alternative arrangements with the requisite speed. 175. Soviet experts and aeroplanes were sent to help the Persians, but the confined forces could not prevent the maturation of very large numbers of Moroccan locusts, which laid eggs over what has later been mapped and estimated at over 110,000 hectares. Arrangements are now being made between the Persians and the Russians for a joint campaign on a very large scale in the Caspian provinces in the spring of 1945. 176. The usual autumn examination of the desert locust situation in the Indo-Persian-East Arabian zone (which took place this year at Delhi in the presence of British, Persian and Soviet members of the Tehran International Locust Control Committee) led to the conclusion that no swarms would enter Persia from India, and up to the end of the year this forecast had been justified. On the other hand, the chief locust officer* of the (British) Middle East Anti- Locust Unit attended an extraordinary meeting of the Tehran Committee in November, and formally warned all countries represented that a number of desert locust swarms would probably escape control during their eastward movement from Africa this winter, and that countries east and north of the Persian Gulf must expect an invasion by desert locusts at any time during the first quarter of 1945. 177. In view of this threat the Middle East Anti-Locust Unit has organised for the Persian Government a hopper-control party under a British anti-locust officer (and provided with British military transport and British poison and bran), which has already taken up its positions to defend the coastal area between Task and Lingeh. The Persian organisation, which, of course, retains respon sibility for the defence of the whole country, has also been put on a “ war footing.”V- THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS secret ESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA.

RELATIONS between Persia and Russia continued to be strained and difficult and at the end of the year had reached a dangerous crisis. 2. At the Yalta Conference in February the Russians made it clear that the manner of the Persian Government’s refusal in 1944 to grant them an oil concession in the north of Persia still rankled. But thereafter they gave up exerting direct pressure on the Persian Government to reconsider the law prohibiting the grant of concessions until after the withdrawal of all foreign troops, and developed other methods of achieving their ends. They increased the activity of their consuls throughout the country and intensified subversive propaganda among all kinds of discontented elements. They also undertook surreptitious experimental borings for oil in at least three places in the northern provinces. In the south the Soviet Consuls’ efforts to fish in troubled waters generally met with effective counter-action from the Persian authorities, but in the north, fortified and protected by the presence of Red troops, their activities made rapid progress. 3. During the third quarter of the year the Tudeh party gained so much influence in Gilan and Mazandaran that the control of affairs had virtually passed into their hands and neither the civil nor military agents of the Central Govern ment could act without Tudeh agreement. 4. In September a new party, the £k Democrats,” was formed in Tabriz to take the place of the Tudeh, whose overbearing conduct had brought it into general opprobrium. The Russian inspiration of the new party was at once obvious and former members of the Tudeh were from the outset its most active and prominent supporters. A general congress of the party was held in Tabriz in October, at which a manifesto was published, demanding full provincial autonomy for Azerbaijan under its own elected council, coupled with the recognition of Turki as the official language of the province. About the middle of November there were skirmishes between Government forces and bands of [77—51]2 Democrats strengthened by Caucasian toughs from the Socialist Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan. The Russian regular forces in the province repeatedly interfered with the movements of the local Persian forces directed to the suppression of this uprising and more than once disarmed detachments which were trying to restore order. On the 19th November the Persian Government despatched a small force of troops and gendarmes from Tehran to reinforce the garrisons in Azerbaijan, but this column was stopped by the Red army before reaching Qazvin. 5. From this point onwards the situation steadily deteriorated, and the whole of Azerbaijan passed rapidly into the hands of the insurgents. By the middle of December an Azerbaijan National Parliament had assembled at Tabriz and proceeded to appoint an autonomous Government. It chose as Prime Minister the Democrat party leader, Dr. Pishavari, who had been elected through Russian pressure as a member of the Fourteenth Majlis but had not succeeded in getting his credentials accepted; and approved his nomination of a Cabinet of nine Ministers, including Ministers for Defence, Interior, Education, Health, Finance and Justice, but not Foreign Affairs. 6. The Persian Government, having been prevented by the Russians from using their forces to deal with the insurgents, sought to resolve the problem by means of diplomatic action. They addressed a note to the Soviet Embassy asking that permission should be given for the column which had been held up to proceed, and at the same time they appealed for support to the Governments of the U nited States and Great Britain. The former responded by proposing that all foreign troops should be withdrawn by the 1st January, and the latter by expressing to the Soviet Government the hope that they would be able to instruct their military commanders to cease to obstruct the movement of Persian forces. 7. To the Persians the Soviet Government replied that they had no objection in principle to the despatch of forces to Azerbaijan but doubted the practical wisdom of such action since it might lead to conflict, in which event the Russian forces in the area would have to be increased. They therefore considered it inexpedient that any more Persian forces should be despatched to the northern provinces. The fictitious quality of this pretext is made evident by the fact that the Russians had about 30,000 troops in Azerbaijan at the time, i.e., about five times as many as the Persians had in the same area, while the reinforcements which the Persians proposed to send to Tabriz numbered only about 1,000 rifles. 8. To the British note the Soviet Government replied that the despatch of more troops to Azerbaijan was undesirable as it would lead to avoidable bloodshed. To the United States they responded by a categorical refusal to withdraw their troops before the date stipulated in the Anglo-Soviet-Persian Treaty of 1942. (This is discussed in more detail in the section dealing with the withdrawal of Allied troops.) 9. Soon after the failure of this friendly intervention by the United States and Great Britain news was received that Mr. Bevin and Mr. Byrnes were to have talks with M. Molotov at the end of December, and the Persian Government suspended further diplomatic action to deal with the Azerbaijan question in the hope that a solution would be found at Moscow. 10. Concurrently with their encouragement and protection of the Azerbaijan &lt;£ Democrats,” the Soviet authorities in Persia gave a similar stimulus to the Kurdish nationalists. This is discussed below in the section on Tribal Affairs. It can be safely assumed, on the available information, that the Soviet plan is to exploit Kurdish nationalism for Russian ends in much the same way that they have utilised the racial sentiments and aspirations of the Turki element in the northern provinces. 11. At the Moscow Conference the British and American delegations submitted on the 24th December a draft agreement for the establishment, with the consent of the Persian Government, of an Anglo-American-Soviet Commission to assist the Persian Government in re-establishing satisfactory relationships with its provinces through the erection of provincial councils as provided by the Constitution of 1907. This commission would also make recommendations to the Persian Government concerning the use of minority languages and would supervise the first elections to the provincial councils. The commission would also investigate, and make recommendations on, the withdrawal of Allied troops. The object of the proposal was to seek Soviet co-operation in limiting Azerbaijan autonomy and bringing that province back under the authority of the Central Government The same evening Generalissimo Stalin informed Mr. Bevin that agreement might be reached on this basis subject to minor amendments. These were presented on the 25th December and accepted by Mr. Bevin on the ri %3 26th December. M. Molotov, however, then refused to discuss the proposal further, mainly on the grounds that the Soviet Government could not deal on such a question with the “ present hostile Persian Government.” The Question of Withdraival of Allied Troops. 12. The embassy’s original suggestion in 1944 was that British troops should be evacuated at least from Tehran as soon as the opening up of supply routes to Russia other than the Persian should render this practicable. It was hoped here that such action would lead to a corresponding Russian withdrawal on the grounds that the Russians could hardly afford the odious comparisons which their continued presence in the country would invite. His Majesty’s Government, however, would only agree to a withdrawal of British troops on a pari passu basis. 13. While maintaining that even the evacuation of Tehran alone by Allied troops would be better than nothing, the embassy became more and more convinced, in the early part of 1945, that a far more radical withdrawal was required, and required soon, if Persia were to be saved from administrative paralysis and progressive disintegration. The Russians had steadily increased their hold over the rich northern provinces. The longer this process continued the smaller the chances of ever dislodging them; and unless they were dislodged no Persian Government could be expected to function as a Government should. The possibility was therefore mooted of negotiating a British withdrawal to the oil fields in the south-west and a corresponding Russian withdrawal in the north. 14. At this stage there were three difficulties about a British withdrawal to the oil area. The first, of course, was that security had to be maintained for “ Aid to Russia.” The second was that Persia and Iraq Command considered it essential for the health of their troops protecting the oil-fields that they should have summer camps in the Kermanshah area, on the. plateau. Thirdly, the argument had to be met that the withdrawal of troops was a policy of appease ment : the right policy, it was suggested, was to tell the Russians that we must stay in Persia because of the war with Japan; the Russians always undeistood a bold front and would respect it. It was suggested in reply that this bold policy would delight the Russians because the more of Persia we occupied the easier it would be for them to justify retention of Soviet troops; that our line, far from being a policy of appeasement, was to use against the Russians the only weapon in our hands, that of exposing their “ imperialist ” tendencies, if they refused to make anv substantial withdrawal, by making the facts public. 15. At the Yalta Conference in February several attempts were made to persuade the Russians to agree to discuss the withdrawal of Allied troops, but both Marshal Stalin and M. Molotov took the line that the exact terms of the Tripartite Treaty should be adhered to and that there was consequently no point in discussing the question. Commenting on this, the embassy pointed out in March that the Russians clearly wished to keep their troops in Persia in order to secure the strongest possible hold over the country before they went. The only weapon left was the weapon of publicity or at least the threat of it. Majesty’s Government did not sanction this, but towards the end of March informed the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government were ready to examine whether some withdrawal could be made before the date fixed by the Anglo-Soviet-Persian Treaty of 1942, namely, six months following the armistice with Japan. This heartened the Persian Government, but the full benefit of publicity could only have been obtained by revealing that His Majesty’s Govern ment had actually proposed a withdrawal to the Soviet Go\eminent and had met with uncompromising refusal. ^ , 16. On the 19th May the Persian Government sent notes to the British, Soviet and American Embassies requesting the immediate withdrawal of the Allied troops fro m Persia on the grounds that they were not necessary for the war with Japan. His Majesty’s Government and the United States Govern ment expressed their willingness to consider the matter sympathetically. His Majesty's Government also proposed to the Soviet Government that Allied troops should start withdrawing from Persia in stages before the final treaty date, but the Soviet Government did not reply. 17 On the 10th July the Foreign Office sent a telegram to His Majesty s Embassy which showed that His Majesty’s Government had adopted the policy described above; we had no form of pressure except to confront the Russians with the alternative of withdrawal simultaneously with us or of being shown up [77—51] B 24 publicly as an “ Imperialist ” Power. We could not be certain the Russians would choose the alternative we desired but there was a reasonable chance that they might. 18. At the Potsdam meeting in July, it was agreed tihat British and Soviet forces should withdraw from Tehran at once, and that the Council of Foreign Ministers, at their meeting in September, should consider further stages ot withdrawal. Under instructions from the Foreign Office, His Majesty’s Embassy made persistent attempts to persuade the Soviet Embassy to co-ordinate the withdrawal from Tehran, but received no reply. The evacuation of British troops and stores began methodically soon after the Potsdam decision, but the last stages were delayed by technical hitches. The last troops left by the 2nd October, only a small liquidation party remaining. Without any warning the Russians withdrew their troops from Qaleh, Murgheh airfields on the 18th September, and claimed to have left Tehran, although they continued, in fact, to hold in it about 250 troops, 45 houses, and the railway station. 19. Meanwhile, on the 20th August, His Majesty’s Government began to use the weapon of publicity. Mr. Bevin, the new Labour Foreign Secretary, announced in Parliament that His Majesty’s Government did not desire, and did not believe that their Soviet Allies desired, to take advantage of the treaty facilities in Persia for any purpose other than the prosecution of the war. Mr. Eden, commenting for the Opposition, added that His Majesty's Govern ment had only one interest in Persia, to see her prosperous, united and strong; the last thing they wanted was a recurrence of the zones of influence of many years ago. 20. On the 9th September the Persian Government sent notes to the British, Soviet and American Embassies requesting that Persian territory should be totally evacuated by the 2nd March, this being six months after the signature of the Japanese armistice, adding that evacuation before then would arouse the gratitude of the Persian nation. 21. At the Council of Foreign Ministers, held in London at the end of September, Mr. Bevin and M. Molotov exchanged correspondence about the with drawal of British and Soviet troops. Mr. Bevin mentioned the obligation to withdraw by the 2nd March, and proposed that, by the middle of December 1945 the British forces should be withdrawn to the southern oil area and the Soviet forces to Azerbaijan. M. Molotov replied that the withdrawal of troops should be effected within the period laid down in the treaty and that if necessary the plan for the final withdrawal of Soviet and British troops could be discussed towards the end of the said period. He added that the Soviet Government attached exceptional importance to the strict fulfilment of obligations under taken. (M. Molotov thus evaded any commitment as to the actual date of withdrawal.) ' -tit 22. On the 5th October the Tass Agency reported that a considerable number of British forces still remained in Tehran. His Majesty’s Embassy countered this by issuing a communique giving exact details of the small rear party remaining in Tehran. Although the Soviet Government had refused to discuss any further immediate withdrawals, the British forces withdrew from Hamadan, Khorramabad and Kermanshah areas by the 21st November, and the embassy gave publicity to this fact also. The squadron which had been main taining security north of Zahidan was withdrawn to India by the 28th November. 23. On the 22nd November the Persian Government addressed a note to the Soviet Embassy asking why there were still Soviet troops in Tehran. Stung, no doubt by this and by the publicity given to British withdrawals, the Soviet authorities abruptly withdrew their remaining personnel, including the railway mission, out of Tehran at the end of November n . 24 On the 5th December the Foreign Office instructed His Majesty s Embassy in Moscow to suggest to M. Molotov that plans should be discussed, in accordance with his letter to Mr. Bevin in September, for the final with drawal of Soviet and British troops. M. Molotov replied that the question need not be discussed before February, assuming it should appear necessary then 25. On the 24th November the American Ambassador m Moscow had proposed to M Molotov in connexion with the Azerbaijan crisis, that all Allied troops should be withdrawn from Persia by the 1st January. The American note referred to the Declaration regarding Persian territorial integrity, signed bv President Roosevelt, Mr. Churchill and Marshal Stalin, at Tehran in 19 4 3 ;n| j state d the American view that the Persian Government should have full’ libertv to move their forces through Persia if they saw fit. The Soviet Government replied by reiterating their intention to adhere to their treatyobligations, but added! a sinister note by including among them the Soviet- Persian Treaty of 1921, which they claimed gave them the right to introduce troops into Persia. 26. The position then at the end of the year was that British troops left in Persia were limited to small detachments in Andimeshk, Ahwaz, Abadan and Khorramshahr to protect the oil area and in Task to protect the aerodrome. The Russians continued to have about 60,000 troops in the provinces of Azer- ^ baijan, Qazvin, Gilan, Mazandaran and Khorassan, and to control the railway f from Firuzkuh to Bandar Shah, on the Caspian. The Americans had executed their declared intention of withdrawing their troops by the 1st January, except for 500 men, hurriedly put into mufti, who were operating the American air field at Abadan. It was beginning to look, therefore, as if the Russians were going to choose the less welcome alternative of the two foreshadowed by the Foreign Office on the 10th July. His Majesty's Government’s tactics, however, had already forced the Soviet Government to unmask itself to some extent. In an obviously inspired article on the 14th December, Prayda affirmed the right of the Soviet Union under the treaty of 1921 to bring its troops into Persia. Pravda went on to ask what right, on the other hand, had the British to bring their troops into Persia in 1941 before the Anglo-Soviet-Persian treaty of 1942 was signed (possibly a pertinent question, but an indecent one for a Russian to ask, seeing that we invaded Persia, by agreement with Russia and mainly to establish a supplv route to Russia). Pravda concluded by querying the presence of British troops in Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Greece, Indonesia, Belgium, France, Holland, Denmark, and Norway, and of American troops in Persia, Egypt and China. The Russians had, therefore, already been driven back onto the weakest of all arguments, the tu quoque. Russian interest in Aerodromes and roads in East Persia. 27. Paragraph 35 of this embassy’s Political Review for 1944 reads as follows :— “ There is one aspect of British activities in Persia which may have given the Russians reasonable cause for suspicion. The aerodromes at Mirjawa and Zahidan were completed at a time when, as a result of the discontinuance of the East Persia supply route, they were no longer needed for military aid to Russia; and work on the aerodrome at Kerman was still continuing at the end of the year. The Zahidan-Kerman and Zahidan- Meshed roads are still being maintained, though they too are no longer needed for sending supplies to the Soviet Union. It seems that the work begun on the aerodromes when the Germans were in the Caucasus was continued with a view to their eventual use as communication airfields on what is, in fact, the most direct route between India and Europe. The Meshed road has been kept up as a potential route for aid to China through Soviet Central Asia, and the Kerman road is being maintained in connexion with the work proceeding on the airfield at Kerman. A visit to South-East Persia late in the year by the Soviet military attache suggests that the Russians are not without interest in these activities. 28. Work on the Kerman aerodrome continued through the first half of 1945 (though in a more desultory fashion), and it was being maintained until the British military authorities handed it over to the Persians in December. The Zahidan-Kerman road was also maintained until it was handed over at the same time as the aerodrome. 4he Zahidan—Meshed road likewise continued to be maintained until it was handed over to the Persians in October, although the Burma road had been opened early in the year, thus rendering the maintenance of the Meshed road for potential aid to China superfluous. 29. Russian military and civilian officials continued to show great interest in our military activities in East Persia and it is possible that the latter may have contributed to Russian suspicions of our intentions and to their violent activity in Azerbaijan at the end of the year. The Zahidan—Meshed road was originally built by the British in the last war and was the sine qua non for the subsequent British advance to Merv. When we reconditioned it in 1942, the Soviet Consul-General in Meshed was openly sceptical that it was intended merely for aid to Russia. Again, the continued construction of the Mirjawa, Zahidan and Kerman aerodromes for two years after the passing of the emergency for which they were intended, namely, a German break through the Caucasus, may well have remind^ed the Russians of how we swept forw ard to6 Baku after tihe last war. Indeed, these aerodromes are likely to be a mor$ permanent source of suspicion than the roads, for the roads are likely to become impassable soon under Persian maladministration, while these concrete aerodromes will remain, a permanent menace to the Baku oilfields. It is to be sincerely hoped that they will, in fact, be used for international civil airlines, so as to establish their innocence. Security in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Area. 30. This problem engaged the attention of the British military authorities and of this embassy continuously during 1945 and our efforts were directed to urging the Persian Government to provide such forces (army, gendarmerie and police) as were considered necessary, and to assume gradually, increased responsi bilities for protection with a view to avoiding any hiatus which might occur between the evacuation of the area by British troops and the re-arrival of Persian forces. A scheme for a special gendarmerie force of 2,000 was put up by Headquarters, South Persia Area, but this was not pressed because money was not available and also because the Russians might use this as a pietext foi raising a similar special force for the protection of their fisheries on the Caspian Coast. A conference which representatives of the British Military, Anglo- Iranian Oil Company, consulate and embassy, and Persian Government depart ments concerned attended, was held in Ahwaz on the oth November, 1945. The strength and location of Persian army troops were adjudged sufficient to dteal with any tribal trouble likely to arise or to act as mobile reserves for reinforce ment of the gendarmerie in prevention of road banditry. The American adviser to the gendarmerie, while unable to supply extra personnel, reoi ganised its existing personnel so as to provide six mobile platoons for protection of the oil company, relieving them of their other normal gendarmerie duties. police, again, through lack of budget provision, could not make up their strength to the total judged necessary and remained 190 men short. Some progress towards the unified command deemed essential by Headquarters, South Persia Area, was achieved by securing the agreement of the Persian representatives to place', for operational purposes, the gendarmerie and police under the orders of the Persian Divisional Commander. The scheme had worked well up to the close of the year and no complaints about insecurity of the area had been received from the oit company. A nglo-Soviet-Persian Censorship. 31. In January 1945, His Majesty’s Embassy proposed to the feoyiet Embassy to discontinue the political censorship of incoming English and Russian printed matter posted by publishing firms within the British Commonwealth, United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, by virtue of which the Soviet section of the Censorship had prevented the delivery of quantities ol British newspapers and magazines. Consistent reprisals by tihe British section against the Soviet press eventually induced the Soviet authorities to a g re ^ 1° this proposal, and large consignments of stopped material were released by both sides in March This success was accounted to be an interesting justification for retaliation as the most effective policy in the conduct of Anglo-Russian ctiTciii's 32. In July the Persian Government formally requested that the censorship should be discontinued. His Majesty’s Embassy had already entered into con sultation with the United States Embassy with a view to the complete cessation of the political, as distinct from the military, censorship. The necessity of defeatin 0, the political censorship imposed b^y the Russians was becoming increasingly urgent as political troubles developed in Persian Azerbaijan, which could not owing to the strenuous Soviet censorship of press messages, be reported to the press except by the Soviet Tass Agency, which was not liable to censorship. With the complete cessation of hostilities, however, it became possible to discon tinue all forms of censorship, and the British section ceased to operate on the 30th August. The Soviet section followed their example with obvious reluctance. Non-Persian Internees. 33 In respect of the non-Persian internees, both deported from Persia to India and Australia and interned in Persia, the principal concern of His Maiesty’s Embassy during the year was the problem of their disposal after release The Combined Intelligence Centre, Iraq and Persia, decided in February7 that the return to Persia of deportees should in principle be opposed on grounds of the inadequacy of the security staff remaining in Persia, of the proximity of neutral countries, and of the prevailing unemployment of Europeans in the country. At an inter-departmental meeting which took place in June, attended by a representative of the Combined Intelligence Centre, this decision was con firmed on the further grounds that even after the end of the Japanese war the /■^resettlement of some hundreds of Axis sympathisers, having now particularly no cause to be favourably disposed towards the British, would not be in the British interest, and that there was no reason to offer an opportunity to past enemies and potential troublemakers to resume their commercial and social relations in Persia so soon after the war. It was therefore decided to recom mend that all internees should be returned to their countries of origin, exception to be made only on compelling compassionate grounds. It has already been decided that none of the twelve Europeans who remained interned in Persia should be allowed to stay in the country. 34. In accordance with this policy, when at the cessation of hostilities the control exercised by Combined Intelligence Centre, Iraq and Persia, over entries into Persia was surrendered on the 18th August, the Persian Government were informed that there was no objection on the part of the British authorities to the return to Persia of certain individuals named; and it appeared to be understood from this by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that it was not desirable to readmit, without reference to His Majesty’s Embassy, any person who had been deported. 35. A large number of applications were received for permission for internees to return to Persia from their relatives in the country, and especially from the Government of India, who were not unnaturally anxious to be rid of their guests as soon as possible, and who forwarded a list of eighty-nine applicants for readmission at the end of the year. Although the hardship involved in some cases was fully realised, a strict interpretation of the policy of disposal by repatriation was upheld, and very few applications have been granted. It was decided, e.g., that no special exception, such as was at one time recommended by the Government of India, should be made in favour of Jews, nor of persons with family interests in Persia, but that these people also should be required to return to their countries of origin first. A number of cases remained under consideration at the end of the year. Persian Internees. 36. In reply to a violent press campaign for the release of Persian internees, touched off by an incident, copiously misreported, which occurred in the intern ment camp in Tehran when an inspecting British officer was involved in an altercation with one of the internees, and to a parliamentary interpellation by Dr. Musaddiq, which was feebly answered by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, demanding by what right Persians had been arrested by the Allies and were still detained, the full story of the activities of the Persian fifth column was issued to the international press in February, and His Majesty’s Ambassador made a written protest to the Minister regarding the disloyalty of press and Government. It became necessary, also, in order to make sure that the odium should be fairly shared by the Soviet authorities, who appeared to be only too anxious to take advantage of the Persian tendency to attack only the British authorities, to publish a further notice in the press emphasising the collabora tion of the Russians in the arrest and detention of suspects. The Soviet security authorities took several of the more important internees to Resht “ for interroga tion,” and there is good evidence from several sources that they used the opportunity to try to recruit them for the cause of Russia. 37. Numbers of internees were released by agreement with the Russians in the following months. On the 25th May, however, the Soviet Embassy proposed the immediate release of all remaining internees, and their security authorities at once informed the Persian police that only the British continued to prevent such a consummation. When His Majesty’s Ambassador was authorised a few days later to inform the Persian Government that there was now no British objection to the release of all except those who had been arrested for their connexion with the Japanese, the Soviet Embassy availed themselves of the opportunity to publish in the press a statement to the effect that the Soviet authorities were not opposed to the release of any of the internees.38. Authority for the release of the thirteen Persians, who thus remained interned in Pe.rsia, and of the five in detention abroad was issued on the 15th August upon the cessation of hostilities with Japan. In order, however, to counter any claim to popular sympathy on the part of the Mullah Kasham, one of the most prominent of the internees, who was expected also to prove one of the most venomous on release, his correspondence with the Mufti of Jerusalem and Rashid Ali was published in the local press. Nothing more was heard of^-, him before the end of the year. • • • - 'V Internal Politics. 39. The instability which was so marked in 1944 remained an outstanding feature of the political life of the country during the year under review. The Administration of Rayat, which was formed in November 1944, was already showing signs of weakness, after only three months in office, and by the middle of April 1945 the Prime Minister and his colleagues gave up the struggle to maintain their position against factious opposition of the Majlis. 40. Bayat was succeeded by Hakimi, a deaf old gentleman who had played no considerable part in Persian public life for many years. His Cabinet lasted less than a month : he was ejected for no particular reason and replaced by Sayed Mushin Sadr. M. Sadr at once found himself in difficulties, but he refused to ask for a vote of confidence, leaving it to the Deputies to take the initiative if they wished to get rid of him. The issue was not faced till almost three months later, when the news from Azerbaijan aroused the patriotic feelings of the Majlis and enabled M. Sadr to obtain a vote of confidence from them. His majority soon proved, however, to be as unstable and ephemeral as those of his predecessors, and a month later he was forced to resign. The chief feature of his time was his attempt to prevent the Tudeh from stirring up violent disorders. Political clubs and demonstrations were forbidden, and this earned for him the usual titles of Fascist and Reactionary from the Tudeh and the Russians. 41. The Majlis then reverted to Hakimi, who was still in office at the end of the year. Nevertheless, by the middle of December it had become evident that his Cabinet could not last much longer in spite of the changes which he made in its members in the vain hope of silencing his critics and of appeasing the Russians without alarming the British. 42. In this atmosphere of constant change and uncertainty, neither the Government nor the Majlis accomplished much work of value. Some fifty draft laws were brought before the House, but the great majority passed into oblivion in the committees to which they were referred. No budget for the current financial year was adopted, and the public services had to depend on small periodic fractions of the budget for 1943, the last complete annual budget to have been passed by the Persian Parliament. 43. In spite, therefore, of the crying need for reforms and planned develop ment, and of the frequent assurances given by Ministers that these needs would receive their urgent attention, nothing was achieved and the administration of the country continued to deteriorate. 44. The only measures of note which were put in the State Book were the laws for the Ratification of the United Nations Charter and the Bretton Woods Agreement, the law for the increase of the establishment of the army by two divisions and the law prohibiting the holding of the next general election until after the withdrawal of all foreign troops. 45. The instability to which reference has been made is due to two main causes. The first is the inherent fickleness and irresponsibility of most of the Deputies, and the second the conflict of Russian and British influences. Of these the former is apparently ineradicable, and the latter has for so long been a forceful element in the political life of the country that its early elimination cannot be hoped for. There is accordingly little prospect of good government for Persia within any foreseeable time. Indeed, as the year closed, confusion and perplexity were dominant, and few could see the way out of political chaos to stability and reform. Persian Press. 46. The arguments over the Russian demand for oil concessions at the end of 1944 developed into a first major split in the Persian press the Freedom Front representing the Russian point of view and the Left generally, and the9 Independence Front providing—to begin with—a rather nebulous opposition. The tone of the press became increasingly embittered as time went on, the 1 ude party and the iSeyyid Zia group respectively drawing towards themsehes the various independent elements. This became particularly marked aftei the Azerbaijan crisis. 47. This situation was met by harsher measures on the part or the authorities, and suppressions became a regular feature of the life of the press. At first this tended to operate in favour of the Left, owing to the pressure cl the Soviet Embassy, but during the latter half of the year the majority of the Left-wing papers were suppressed, leaving the Light virtually tree to campaign at will. A large number of releases at the end of Novembei were followed by a further wave of suppressions at the end of the year. Nevertheless, throughout the whole period sufficient alternative licences were available to enable the Left-wing point of view to be put forward with its usual virulence. 48. The Right-Left split was in many respects a reflection of real or imaginary diflerences between the great Powers nearest to Persia. There was an increasing tendency to regard Russia and the Anglo-American bloc as natural rivals; and party differences followed international rather than domestic lines. Both sides showed enthusiasm in searching out and magnifying differences between the Allies, notably in comment on the Foreign Ministers’ Conference and on the Anglo-American oil discussions. Difficulties in Persia and throughout the would were freely attributed to Anglo-Russian differences. Nevertheless, it was the Right that began to take an increasingly international point of view. When the Azerbaijan situation became acute, the Left showed great anxiety to remove the question from the international sphere, denying that the Russians were in any way connected with the movement, and describing it as the natural popular reaction to the oppression of the Central Government. The Right were equally vehement in their belief that the Democrats had no popular support and relied on “ foreign hirelings”; and they appealed to Britain and America to intervene. Curiously enough, there was little reference at this stage to the U.N.O. All parties showed alarm or uneasiness at the prospect of partition or disintegra tion, the Left wing being at as great pains to deny the separatist motives of the Democrats as the Right wing were to assert them. 49. While a few Left-wing papers openly advocated the formation of a pro-Russian Government in Tehran, the tendency among other sections of the press to appease Russia became less noticeable, especially as the Azerbaijan situation developed; some Right-wing papers were outspoken in their criticisms of Russian foreign policy. The popular desire for Allied evacuation of Persia after the end of the European w^ar (the Far East was virtually ignored) was fully exploited, the Russian attitude being awaited with hope rather than confidence. 50. By way of diversion, the Left-wing press developed an increasingly violent anti-British campaign. While at the beginning of the year this was confined to general attacks on imperialism and international reaction, later more specific references to India, Greece, the Arab League, Indonesia and so on, made it quite clear where the target lay. The final stage was an open campaign against alleged British interference in Persia’s internal affairs. Circumstantial accounts were given of British influence over the tribes of the south, and allegations were made of collusion between British authorities and the Persian General Staff. A campaign was started against the A.I.O.C., and the demand for the return of Bahrein was revived. It was asserted that a cardinal point of British policy was to maintain a servile and backward Persia and a buffer State between India and Russia. 51. The advent of the Labour Government in Britain was greeted with suspicion on both sides. The Right feared closer Anglo-Russian co-operation, while the Left suspected it of being no more than a facade. A statement attributed to Mr. Bevin by a Tudeh journalist reporting a conversation at a party in London—that British policy in the Middle East would not be changed, provided a recurring text for the development of this theme. 52. The tone of the press towards America sharpened a little over the question of the disposal of military assets, but in general it was friendly and almost sycophantic; she was rarely included in the attacks on internationa 1 capitalism. 53. Considerable anxiety was shown over the internal economic situation, and much of this was attributed to Persia’s hardships and sacrifices during the war. While, however, there were usual attacks on the Governments of the day and the Majlis, there was little in the way of concrete proposals. Demands for economic and social reform came at the Ixfltom of the list and were usually of an ad hoc character—for example, reductions in the prices of monopoly goods. [77—51] e54. Public opinion, so far as it was formed, was more heavily weighted on- the anti-Russian side than the balance of the press might suggest. All classes showed considerable alarm over the events in the north-west, and rumours of l ' Democrats ' incursions southwards and towards Tehran were freely discussed. Many people feared similar outbreaks in other parts of the country. The attitude towards Britain became progressively more favourable as Russian support of the Tudeh elements became more obvious. Tribal Affairs. 55.—(a) General .—With the exception of Kurdistan, 1945 was a quiet year in respect of tribal affairs. The Persian Government, with its hands full in the north and its forces in no trim for conflicts with well armed tribesmen, was only coo glad to leave them alone. The Khans, for their part, were happy to live undisturbed, to retain their arms and to amass much ill-gotten wealth by selling on the black market the stocks of tea, sugar and piece-goods which were handed over to them by the Government for distribution to their tribesmen. (b) This area remained quiet except for some raiding on a small scale in the extreme south by Bahmai and Teyyibi on Murteza Quli Khan ; s properties near Deh Diz. The Persian Government, after more than three years incessant pressure by His Majesty's Embassy, succeeded at last in apprehending the murderers of Mr. Harris and Dr. Griffiths and his son. They are now awaiting trial by a military tribunal in Tehran. Rivalry between the Ilkhani and Haji Ilkhani branches of the Haft Lang section of the Bakhtiari increased and was partially responsible for the ever-growing volume of complaints against the rule of Murteza Quli Khan. Even the khans of his own branch, however, became sore at failing to be represented in the governorship or to secure a share of the fruits of office. Murteza Quli Khan, though he could justly claim to have kept Bakhtiari quiet during a difficult period, was largely to blame on account of his rough ways and unbending attitude. Perhaps the greatest cause of resentment was his retention as a general factotum of an unprincipled adventurer by the name of Misbah Fatemi who, himself no Bakhtiari, enriched himself considerably at their expense. A scheme for widei representation of some of the khans in Bakhtiari Government was therefore proposed and was under discussion at the end of the year. (c) Qashgai. —There is little of importance to report from this tribe. Nazir Khan acquired sufficient confidence to pay a visit to Tehran and to see the Shah. According to unconfirmed reports, his younger brothers Khosro Khan and Muhammad Husain had some undesirable contacts in Tehran among Tudeh and Russian circles. Some resentment was felt by Nasir Khan and his brothers at the appointment of Mehdi Farrukh as Governor-General, but it appeared to be growing less. Towards the end of the year the Persian Government proclaimed a general amnesty for the tribes of Pars, giving them permission to bear arms under licence for the duration of the present emergency. It was a wise gesture as the tribes now feel reassured that they will not be called to answer for their share in the hostilities of Semirun of two years ago when a small Persian military force was severely defeated at their hands and lost most of its arms. (d) Khuzistan —The disarmament operations against the Arabs were concluded and about 1,000 rifles were collected from the Aha Dasht area and a slightly larger number from the Beni Turuf who subsequently fled across the Iraq border. (e) Kurdistan. —It is convenient for the purposes of this report to divide this area into two, i.e., Northern and Southern Kurdistan, not for any ethno graphical reasons, but because the former lies within the area occupied by Russian troops or under “Democrat” rebel influence and presents, therefore, special problems of its own. The boundary may be considered to be about Bukan, some 80 miles south-east of Lake Urumiyeh. (f) Northern Kurdistan —In this area the attitude of the tribes caused the Persian Government the greatest concern. For a long time past the Soviet authorities had prevented the Persian Government from taking any measures to enforce their authority, with the result that the tribes from Maku to Bukan were a law unto themselves except in so far as they were restrained by Russian officials. For a time endeavours were made by the Russians to induce the Kurds to join the “ Democrat ” party, but its principles of industrial and agrarian reforms found little favour in the eyes of the Kurdish chiefs. Russian support was then transferred to the movement for Kurdish independence known as Komala. A party of Kurdish chiefs were taken on a visit to Baku where they11 were given to understand by the President of the Azerbaijan Socialist Republic that Russian support would be forthcoming for a movement for an autonomous Kurdistan if the Kurds in their turn supported the Democrat movement for an autonomous (Persian) Azerbaijan. Actually the Kurds took very little part in the &gt;4 Democrat ' movement and were not called upon to fight for it against Persian military, gendarmerie or police forces, though they have been plentifully supplied with arms and ammunition by the Russians. As far as is known they were not being enlisted in the Azerbaijan people’s army. They received no seats in the Azerbaijan National Government Cabinet, and it is evident that the Russians are keeping the two movements entirely separate. An added complica tion in this area was introduced by the entry of Mulla Mustafa Barzani who, with a large following, took refuge in Persia after his defeat at the hands of the Iraq Government. They were billeted by the Russians on Kurdish tribes and villages around the southern end of Lake Urumiyeh, and Mulla Mustafa was reported to be concerting with the Kurdish ruler of Mahabad, Gazi Muhammad Haziri, further measures of retaliation against Iraq or revolt in Persia. Even if the Russians withdrew from Azerbaijan the Persian Government would be faced with a formidable task in reasserting their authority in this region. (g) Southern Kurdistan. —In August an attack on the frontier post at Merivan by Mahmud Khan Kanisenani forced the Persian army to undertake punitive operations against him. To show the flag in an area but little visited by troops since the entry of the British and Soviet troops into Persia and to collect arms were subsidiary objects in the plan of campaign. For some months the operations under General Hushmand Afshar dragged on with little or no advantage to the military. General Afshar himself, a gallant and energetic commander in the field, is a man of no political insight and is obsessed, moreover, with an implacable hatred of all Kurds. Like many senior officers of the Reza Shah regime he entirely failed to recognise that the tribes, be they Kurds or Qashgais, have, like other Persian subjects, certain elemental rights and that a policy of unceasing oppression was not likely to induce them to be law-abiding subjects. He was succeeded in command by General Humayuni from Khuzistan who evinced a more reasonable outlook. The operations were brought to a temporary successful conclusion with the flight of Mahmud Khan Kanisenani into Iraq, the death of Mahmud Khan Dizli and the surrender to the Iraqi authorities of Hasan Khan Rezabi. With the advent of winter, which would have forced the Persian troops to suspend operations and withdraw to their permanent stations, it was fortunate that events turned out as they did. The Persian forces were able to return to their wfinter quarters at Merivan, Baneh, Sardasht, Saqqiz and Senneh. About 1,500 rifles were collected, mostly of obsolete pattern and from semi-settled tribes. It will be recalled that Hama Rashid, after sacking Baneh. fled into Iraq and gave himself up to the Iraqi authorities in November 1944. Negotiations for his extradition broke down and the Government of Iraq would only consent to keeping him in residence forces at Kirkuk. At the close of the year, owing to Iraqi negligence, Hama Rashid made his escape and crossed the Persian frontier near Penjwin. He is believed to be in Mahabad conferring with Sadr Ghazi and other Kurdish chiefs. More will probably be heard of him. Persian Army. 56.—(a) High Command. —Ibrahim Zand, the Minister for War. resigned on account of ill health in October 1945 and was succeeded by General Riazi who came into office in November with the Hakimi Cabinet. General Riazi is intelligent, cultured, patriotic and honest, and commands great respect in the army, but he lacks drive, and from the beginning seemed uncertain of his ability to work with the rest of the Cabinet or to cope with the formidable task of improving the administration of the army. General Arfa continued throughout the year to hold the appointment of Chief of the General Staff. His rough tongue, his violent likes and dislikes, his vindictive treatment of those whom he considered inimical to him or who were close associates of his predecessor, General Razmara, gained for him a wide unpopularity. Everyone admits his courage and his energy, especially in the mutiny and Azerbaijan crises, but his endless dabbling in politics and parties did him more harm than good. Much pressure was brought on the Prime Minister, the Minister for War and the Shah to remove him, and his early fall from office was to be expected. (b) Administration. —The American Military Mission under Major-General C. S. Ridley now numbers some twenty officers. As some of the officers’ wives have arrived it appears as if the mission expects to stay. Their contract expired [77—51] ' c 212 in March 1945 but, at the request of the Persian Government, the United states Government allowed them to stay lor the time being. Results of their work are less and less in evidence. The members of the mission appointed to provincial formations attempt, with varying success, to supervise the supply situation and transactions. Those at the centre limit their functions to giving some unheeded advice on transport and medical services and act as agents for the supply of such material as the Persian Government can afford to buy from the United States. 57. The strength of the Persian army stands at about 90,000 officers and men, from which must now be deducted the 6,000 men of the Azerbaijan Division who, after their surrender, either drifted away to their homes or possibly joined the rebel “ Democrat ” army. A Bill to provide a credit of 165 million rials for the raising of two additional infantry divisions of about 6,000 men each was passed by the Majlis in September 1945. Up to the end of the year recruiting on a small scale had started in Hamadan Province for one of these divisions. ^ credit of 35'million rials was also granted by the Majlis for the improvement of the living conditions of Persian officers which, with their miserably low rates of pay and the fantastically high cost of living were appalling. Free houses in the vicinity of barracks, a small annual increment, a children’s allowance, two free issues of uniform per annum, and the creation of a co-operative society for the supply of certain staple commodities at rates cheaper than those prevailing in the open market were the items in this programme of financial relief. A further credit of 3 million dollars for the purchase of stores (mostly clothing, boots and medicines) from the United States was also passed. (c) Morale .—From the point of view of their effect on morale two events occurred in 1945 which were of the greatest importance, viz. :—a mutiny among the officers and the surrender of the garrisons in Azerbaijan. Regarding the mutiny the story is as follows. Despair over their financial embarrassment, discontent at the slowness of promotion, disgust at the incompetence of their seniors had for some time been felt by most Persian officers. The Russians were not slow to notice this and, both directly and indirectly through their agents the Tudeh party, fanned the flames of this discontent, in mid-August eighteen officers of the Meshed garrison headed by a lieutenant-colonel in the Supply Department obtained possession of a jeep, two lorries, a W/T set and arms and ammunition. To prevent pursuit they immobilised the remaining army vehicles by removing their switch keys and by putting salt in their petrol tanks. (Sugar, though more effective, is too expensive in Persia.) With the connivance of the Russian control post (some say avoiding the control post by a detour) they made their way to Bujnurd, having taken the precaution of cutting the telegraph lines between Meshed and Kuchan. On arrival there they gave out that they were come on an inspection of the cavalry squadron stationed there. This they disarmed and made for the Turcoman steppes. It was thought in Meshed, and the General Staff was so informed by the Russians, that these mutineers would join forces with a band of armed Turcomans said to number between one and two thousand, and subsequently attack Meshed. The Chief of the General Staff, having much experience of Russians, did not think that they would go out of their way to give him accurate information about a gang of mutineers with whom they were probably in sympathy, nor did he think it likely that the Russians would tamely allow them to attack one of their garrison towns. He acted therefore on the assumption that their information was wilfully misleading and reckoned on the mutineers heading in the opposite direction. Havino- no troops in Gunbad-i-Qabus, through which place they must pass he asked for the assistance of the gendarmerie who acted with the greatest promptness and energy. The local commandant, a lieutenant, hurriedly collected the men from their scattered posts and was able to assemble a force of about 1\ companies before the mutineers put in an appearance. They demanded right of wav but were refused. A battle then ensued in which the gendarmerie, first putting the vehicles out of action, then fired upon their occupants. Seven of the mutineer officers were killed and two were wounded and taken prisoner. The vehicles, arms and ammunition were recovered. The next day three officers and four men were picked up in an exhausted condition nearby on the road between Gunbad-i-Qabus and Shahrud. Later, six officers from the Tehran garrison, headed by a lieutenant-colonel on the General Staff, deserted and effected a junction with the Meshed mutineers just before the skirmish at Gunbad-i-Qabus. These seven, and six of the Meshed mutineers, are still at large. Two others from Tehran and Tabriz who deserted later also joined them° In Tehran a commission was appointed to examine the antecedents and contacts of officersvs ot the central garrison. Thirty officers were found to have close contacts with the iudeh party or the Russians and were detained under a clause of the Military Governorship law until Military Governorship comes to an end. Ten, less deeply implicated, were sent away to divisions in the south. Further arrests were made as further details of the mutiny came to light. The Chief of General Staff, on the strength of the information so far extracted from the captured mutineers, is of the opinion that a plot for a general uprising existed and that the Meshed w party acted precipitately, thus causing the general mutiny to go off at half-cock. Two officers sent by the General Staff to make a full report on the Gunbad-i-Qabus skirmish and to retrieve the captured vehicles and arms were sent away by the Russians without being able to complete their task. A party of 200 gendarmes proceeding by lorry as reinforcements for the gendarmerie at Gunbad-i-Qabus was turned back by the Russians at Firuzkuh. A lorry conveying bombs for the Persian air force detachment at Meshed was turned' back by the Russians at Semnan. Reinforcements for the Meshed garrison coming from Turbat-i- Sheikh Jan were stopped at the Russian control post south of Meshed. The fact that the original party of mutineers was able to leave Meshed at all and pass through the Russian control post en route, the attitude of the Russian- controlled Tudeh party in Meshed and elsewhere towards the mutiny, and the presence in Bujnurd of the Russian Vice-Consul at Meshed a few hours prior to the arrival of the mutineers, add to the growing weight of testimony to the effect that the whole affair from beginning to end—and the end is not yet in sight—had the knowledge and approval of the Russians. Subsequently, it was learnt that most of the officers still at large had joined up with the Azerbaijan “ Democrat ” rebels and had been given posts in the Azerbaijan People’s army. Regarding Azerbaijan the sad story can be told in a few words. The Acting British Consul-General, Tabriz, had more than once stated, even during the early days of the Democrat movement, that in his opinion the Persian commandeiv „^ r - would not put up a fight if seriously threatened. Cut off from supplies of food and clothing, with little or no backing from the Cabinet, surrounded by Red army soldiers either in uniform or mufti and a populace with scores to settle for past acts of tyranny by the army, gendarmerie and police, it was not surprising that they allowed themselves first to be confined to their barracks by the rebels and later to be disarmed. Of actual fighting there was little, though some officers are reliably reported to have been murdered in cold blood. The garrisons surrendered one by one, all, except Rezaieh, showing only token resistance. Nearly all of the officers have arrived back in Tehran, having been offered by the rebels the choice of departure or joining the Azerbaijan People’s army. The 6,000 men of the division, having been told to disperse by their officers, will have made their own way home. Some few, possibly, may have joined the rebel army, for which a recruiting drive is in progress. The 150 rials per month plus uniform and food may attract some. The year 1945, therefore, has been a bad one for the Persian army. Gendarmerie. 58. There is no evidence available to indicate any substantial progress, except perhaps in the capital, in the efficiency of the gendarmerie as a whole. Co-operation between the army and the gendarmerie is rare, a state of affairs which precludes any effective measures being implemented for the maintenance of security throughout the country. 59. Colonel Schwarzkopf, since his return from the United States, has been obliged, through lack of funds and suitable personnel, to shelve many of the elaborate reforms contained in the reorganisation scheme to which he has devoted most of his attention over a period of two years. During the year under review he has, however, introduced two very essential reforms. Sections are being increased from six to eight men and no post will eventually have the ^ strength of less than a platoon, i.e., thirty-eight men. His Persian gendarmerie officers are to be changed round every two years, thereby minimising the opportunities for graft 60. During the recent disturbances in Azerbaijan the regiments at Tabriz and Rezaieh were almost completely lost, only some 250 officers and warrant, officers finding their way back to headquarters in Tehran. There is a scheme to replace them by two of the seven new regiments which are at present in process of formation in Tehran. This will bring the total strength of the force up to eighteen regiments with a grand total of approximately 34,000 officers and14 men. The number of motorised companies has reached four to date and there remain four more still to be formed. JDuring his visit to the f nited States at the beginning of the year, Colonel Schwarzkopf arranged for the purchase of 500 vehicles and W/T equipment to provide for a “ net” of ten stations, also for the employment of two extra American officers for the mission. The officers have arrived and the complement of his staff is now eight, but, owing to the Persian Government’s inability to provide dollars, it has not yet been ^ possible to obtain the equipment. Police. 61. The history of the police force for the period under review is one of steady decline in organisation, administration and efficiency. Corruption and venality prevail throughout. Only a mission of foreign officers with adequate powers, which once granted can be exercised independently of changes in Govern ment, and adequate funds at their disposal, can be expected to turn the force into an instrument for the impartial suppression of disorder, and even they, as the experience of the American officers with the gendarmerie has shown, would have no easy task. So far no official move has been made towards establishing such a mission and it is thought that lack of the funds which would be require.! to pay for its officers and upkeep is the principal reason against the opening of negotiations. Persian Air Force. 62. During tne year the standard of training, discipline and morale remained low, though some not unsuccessful minor operations were undertaken during the autumn in support of the army in Kurdistan, a small detachment of Hind aircraft being sent to Kermanshah for this purpose. The return of the nine pilots who had done a course of flying training in the United Kingdom gave a slight fillip to training, though one of them typically enough killed himself shortly afterwards by a stupid piece of unauthorised low flying. 1 he most important development of the year, however, was the conclusion of arrangements to re-equip the air force with more modern aircraft and to combine this with a training programme more ambitious than has yet been undertaken by the Persian air force since its foundation. 63. The proposals are, indeed, by modern standards, modest enough. They comprise the purchase of thirty-four Hurricane aircraft with spares and ground equipment, the despatch by Hawker-Siddeley Aircraft of a party of technicians to remain for three years in Tehran and supervise the erection, maintenance and use of the Hurricanes and reorganise the Persian air force factory at Doshan Tappeh. and the provision of a number of courses or attachments to Royal Air Force units in the United Kingdom or Middle East for Persian air force officers and n.c.os. The plan had been approved by the Persian Ministries of War and Finance and by the end of the year the first steps had been taken to give effect to it. If it is carried through, it should have the result of consolidating the attachment of the Persian air force to British equipment and methods for a fair time tc come, and is a first and most necessary step towards the survival of that force even at the low level of efficiency which is all it is ever likely to attain. Civil Aviation in Persia. 64. In spite of much talk the year saw no practical development in Persian airline operation. The State airline continued to run inefficiently but with fair regularity from Tehran to Bagdad and Bushire. Various schemes, backed by private interests and in one case involving American participation, were started, discussed and dropped. It is possible that one or more may be revived, but nothing concrete has yet come to light, 65. In the foreign field, the B.O.A.C. service to Tehran, whose locus standi was that of a military service in connexion with the presence of British troops in Tehran, was stopped on the withdrawal of those troops at the end of Septembei and had not been resumed by the end of the year. The Russians continued to run as before, moving their installations from Qaleh Morgheh to Mehrabad airfield at the end of the year. The French ran a fortnightly service, initially by the device of requesting leave to operate a special flight every other week but have apparently now achieved recognition as a regular line. The Americans have apparently secured temporary rights to use Abadan on their eastern line which i? be in c? taken over by the Trans-continental Western Air Company from the15 United States Air Transport Command, and Pan-American Airways ran a trial flight through Tehran in connexion with their proposed route through Turkey to India and beyond just after the year’s end. The Persian Government seem anxious to encourage foreign airlines rather than otherwise. The End of Dr. MiUspaugh and His Mission 66. It was stated in the Annual Political Review of 1944 that there was a renewed agitation to deprive Dr. Millspaugh of his economic powers, i.e., his functions of purchase, distribution, price control and sale of certain food-stuffs and other goods, as distinguished from his financial powers proper. On the 8th January the Majlis passed a Bill depriving him of them. Dr. Millspaugh thereupon resigned and left Persia on the 28th February, justifiably disgusted at his treatment by the Persian Government and its ingratitude for the con siderable services he had rendered. (For an appreciation of his qualities and defects see the Review for 1944.) At first a number of his American staff stayed on. The Persian Government, however, whittled down their numbers and their powers until in October the American Ambassador informed the Persian Govern ment that they were not in a position to do any good and that as this was injurious to the prestige of the United States, the State Department wished the American Finance and Economic Mission withdrawn from the 21st November. It was, however, lef to individual members of the mission to exercise their own judgment whether they should make individual contracts with the Persian Government. At the end of the year five men remained. 67. The failure of the Millspaugh Mission, due largely to Persian corruption and intrigue but also, unfortunately, to his excessively rigid and professorial attitude, is a tragedy both for Persia and for British interests which are to see an independent and well-ruled Persia. There is now nothing to save the country from its chronic maladministration, and this will render it perpetually liable to upheavals and Soviet intervention. Finance. 68. Owing to the absence of the necessary majority, the Government was unable to secure sufficient votes to pass the annual budget for the financial year 1945-46, with the result that the Administration had to continue a hand-to- mouth existence. Credits were voted on the basis of votes covering one-twelfth or two-twelfths of the estimates and this proved to be most unsatisfactory because, apart from the fact that the votes were almost invariably well in arrear of the period they covered, it was impossible for individual departments to make provision for any capital expenditure. On the whole, revenues came in on the scale forecast in the estimates, the principal source of revenue being the monopolies and import duties. The loss of revenue from Azerbaijan, one of the few provinces which really pays its way from the fiscal point of view, is bound to increase the Government’s difficulties. ... 69. A praiseworthy effort to introduce a little long-term planning m the financial administration was made by the Ministry of Finance in the Hakimi Cabinet. A Bill was introduced allocating Government expenditure on a percentage basis, each department being allocated a predetermined percentage of the estimated revenue. It is interesting to observe that whilst army, gendarmerie the police allocations were reduced from 39 per cent, of the 1945-46 budget to 30 per cent, of the 1946-47 budget, there was a marked increase in the allocation for social services. The vote for education was increased from 9-5 per cent, to 14 per cent., and that for the Ministry of Health and its associated organisations was increased from 3-5 per cent, to 10 per cent. The Bill had not been voted by the end of the year. 70. It is also interesting to observe that in the Bill all Government liabilities were to be consolidated and funded in a single account with the Bank Melli, and that these liabilities were to be liquidated within a period of fifteen years from the oil royalties derived from the A.I.O.C. 71 The rate of exchange (rials 128 = £1) continued to be that stipulated under the Anglo-Persian Financial Agreement, due to come to an end on the 2nd March, 1946. . ...... 72. The Imperial Bank of Iran’s concession as an authorised bank was renewed on the 17th October, 1945, by agreement with the Persian Ministry of Finance. The concession is valid for six months and is thereafter subject to six months’ notice of denunciation.* 16 Economics. 73. The closing months of the year were marked by a welcome tendency towards de-control of trade. The monopolies of the importation of cotton piece- goods and of motor cars and tyres were abolished, and the import licensing system was discontinued except for those articles which are still on the controlled list drawn up by the British Supply Mission in Cairo. 74. The Exchange Control regulations, which were generally disregarded,^ were reintroduced and the Exchange Control Commission was reconstituted. As far as the sterling area is concerned, the measures of control do not impose any restrictions on the transfer of sterling against imports, and authorised banks are free to sell sterling against the presentation of import documents, and to open sterling credits in the sterling area against export documents. The Exchange Control Commission has also placed no undue restriction on the transfer oi sterling for personal expenses, transfer of a proportion of the salaries of British subjects, &amp;c. The new regulations stopped the transfer of capital, and this resulted in a black market rate for sterling, which, however, never rose abose 152 rials as against the official rate of 130. The Government s endeavours to collect foreign exchange and particularly dollar exchange resulting from exports were not successful, and whilst residents in this country hdld many millions of dollars in the United States, the Government’s stocks are practically non-existent In order to pay for the United States rolling-stock the Government was obliged to sell gold, and for private imports practically the whole trade is financed by the purchase of privately-owned dollars, with the result that the black market rate for dollars rose to over 60 dollars as against the official rate of 32^, though it fell somewhat towards the end of the year. 75. The Minister of Finance proposed towards the end of the year the reintroduction of the former system whereby imports should be financed solely from the sale of export certificates, the exporter being allowed to retain 85 per cent, of his foreign exchange or to sell it to a prospective importer. The proposal, although approved by the Cabinet, was not put into practice, and with the ratification on the 27th December, 1945, by the Persian Government of the Bretton Woods Agreement it is hoped that nothing more will be heard of this restrictive measure. Transport. 76. During 1945, road transport was operated with great difficulty, owing to the lack of tyres and the dilapidated condition of the majority oi the vehicles, most of which are at least five years old. The situation was eased to some extent by the sale of a large number of load-carrying vehicles from Allied sources, and by the carefully controlled issue of new tyres. Towards the end of the year, the Government-operated transportation department was closed, which was perhaps just as well, as, with the withdrawal of Allied military control, it is doubtful whether the transport company would have attained even a modest degree of efficiency. The Government sold to private buyers much of the large fleet of trucks used by the Transportation Department, and this, combined with the sale of the department’s stocks of tyres and of part-worn tyres offered by the Allied military authorities, made the situation by the end of the year considerably easiei, and there was an appreciable fall in the price of load-carrying vehicles. Few passenger vehicles were imported or disposed of by the Allied authorities, but traffic between towns was relieved by the conversion of trucks into buses by private operating companies. T ^ r. • 77. With the cessation of hostilities and of Lease-Lend traffic tor Russia, very little was done to maintain roads, many of which were showing signs of bad wear and tear. The British military authorities sold over 4,000 tons of bitumen to the Tehran Municipality for account of the Persian Government, but little or no attempt was made to use it. 78. The section of the Persian State Railways operated by the British and American military authorities was turned over entirely to State operation on the 1st July, and discussions were proceeding at the end of the year for the settle ment of freight charges during the period of the Allied military operation of the line The Ahwaz-Khorramshahr line, built by the Allied authorities, was offered to the Persian Government, together with the improvements in the port of Bandar Shahpur The extension to Khorramshahr port was included in the offer made by the United States military authorities and accepted by the Persian Govern ment The Persian State Railways acquired a valuable addition to their rolling- stock by the acceptance of an offer made by the United States military authorities. This included 461 oil tank cars, which were essential for the adequate distributioni 17 of oil. This is important, as a break-down in distribution would have, however unjustly, been blamed on the Anglo-lranian Oil Company. An offer for the sale of a limited number *of rolling-stock was also made by the British military authorities. This offer had been accepted by the Ministry of Communications by the end of 1945, but still awaited ratification by the Government. 79. The Russians returned the lines from Tehran to Mianeh, Shahrud and /•v Firuzkuh at the end of November, but kept the line from Firuzkuh to the Caspian. Whilst a great deal of consideration was given by the Persian Government to the completion of the line from Tehran to Tabriz and from Tehran to Meshed, a combination of the Russian occupation, political crises, the instability of successive Cabinets, and the difficulty of supply of material from abroad all combined to prevent any progress in this direction. Disposal of British and American Military Assets. 80. (a) Telecommunication System. —The telecommunication system installed by the British military authorities is now being administered, or rather maladministered, by the Persian Department of Posts and Telegraphs, who have incidentally failed to make either of the first two payments specified in the Act of Sale. A quantity of maintenance material was also handed over to them. (b) Fixed Assets — General .—All fixed assets, with the exception of transportation assets and the sawmill in Tehran, have now been disposed of, either by direct sale to contractors or by inclusion in the overall offer made by the American military authorities. (c) Transportation Assets .—An offer was made to the Ministry of Com munications for the sale of all fixed transportation assets on the basis of 33-J per cent, of their original construction cost, estimated to be 336 million rials. (Details are given in the section headed “ Transport.”) (id) United States Fixed Assets. —The United States military authorities made an overall offer to the Persian Government for the sale of all American fixed assets, on the basis of 7-| per cent, of their original construction cost. This offer, made without prior consultation with us, included certain British military installations in areas in which we had a minority interest. The purchase price is payable in dollars, to be covered by Persian Government bills at 3, 5 and 7 years’ sight. (e) United States Military Stores. —All surplus United States military stores at Khorramshahr were sold to a group of Persian financiers against a cash payment of 6 million dollars. The payment of dollars was found from private Persian dollar holdings in the United States. Prospects of British Trade. 81. At the present time the sterling area holds all the aces, as the Persian Government has no dollar resources and can only obtain them by selling part of its gold reserves. It is true that there are considerable private holdings of dollar exchange, and this could be sold, but as the open market rate for free dollars is considerably above the official rate, United States trade would be considerably handicapped if financed by this means. The sterling position is, on the other hand, satisfactory, and no restrictions have so far been placed by the Persian Exchange Control Commission on the sale of sterling or the opening of documentary credits for the importation of goods from the sterling area. There is a widespread demand for goods, but the limiting factors are shipping and supply position in the United Kingdom. It is somewhat unfortunate that the supply position of textiles (cotton, woollen and rayon piece-goods) which are in great demand, is still unsatisfactory, and that the United Kingdom can allocate only a small quota to this market. 82. Merchants in this country are obviously anxious to establish direct relations with United Kingdom suppliers and the Commercial Secretariat has a formidable waiting list of merchants, anxious to go to the United Kingdom in order to re-establish their commercial relationships or to develop new ones. With the present problems of shipping and air transport, the greater part of these applications has had to be held in suspense. 83. Whilst there is a demand for practically every branch of United Kingdom manufactures, it should be borne in mind that this market easily reaches saturation point, and with the low standard of commercial integrity in this country there is always the risk that merchants will repudiate their contracts when the supply position becomes easier, and prices fall in consequence. For this reason it is recommended that as a general rule business with this country should be transacted on the basis of irrevocable credits. [77—51] d18 c Middle East Supply Centre. 84. The TIiddle East Supply Centre ceased to exist on the 31st October, and was replaced as far as the sterling area and sterling area-controlled resources of supply are concerned by the British Supply Mission (Middle East). The general tendency is towards the rapid decontrol of trade, but there are still m existence lists of goods, such as cereals and sugar, which can be supplied only ^ on the basis of annual quota and by bulk procurement from the British Supply Mission. There is also a short list of goods, of which the supply position is difficult, and for which the Persian Government have been requested to main tain the system of import licensing. The work of liaison between the Persian Government and the British Supply Mission, Cairo, has, with the abolition o: Middle East Supply Centre, been transferred to the commercial secretariat of this embassy. United Kingdom Commercial Corporation. 85. With the cessation of “ Aid to Russia,' the primary functions of the L nited Kingdom Commercial Corporation in this country came to an end, and it is perhaps fitting that in this survey for 1945 the invaluable work carried out by this organisation should be placed on record. The organisation of road transport in Persia presented a formidable task, and its successful discharge R- the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation was a material contribution to the total war effort. By the end of 1945 the greater part of the staff of the corporation had departed, and the organisation is now represented only by a skeleton staff engaged in the work of liquidation. The bulk of the corpora tion’s claims against the Persian Government are now well on the way towards liquidation, as is also the claim advanced by the Persian Ministry of Finance for payment of income tax for the financial years 1944-45 and 1945-46. The corporation have compounded with the fiscal authorities for a total payment of f £3.000 for each year. Ministry of Economic Warfare. 86. With the close of hostilities, the work of Ministry of Economic War fare has necessarily decreased. Certificates of origin and interest are still issued where required, and notifications have been sent to the Persian Government in regard to the maintenance of the statutory list, but in general Ministry of *■ Economic Warfare work has virtually come to an end. Cereals and Agriculturdl Development. 87. Thanks to hard work by the British officer team of cereals collectors there were, at the time they left in September, 170,000 tons of bread-grains in Government stores in Persia, and of this 108,000 tons was wheat. 88. In addition there were reputed to be some 100,000 tons surplus to the country’s requirements and available for export, but the Soviet Government s refusal to countenance its export frightened the Persian Government into silence and to acquiescence in the danger of its rotting in the village granaries. 89. Since then the Azerbaijan granary has been closed to Tehran and the future is unknown, but by all calculations there must be many months' stocks in the capital, although statistics are no longer available. Locust Control. 90. The locust danger during 1945 turned out to be small, in spite of alarums caused by Persian locust officers inflating the danger of infestation, : n order to obtain surplus stocks of poison to sell for their own fraudulent profit. The British anti-locust unit, which had done excellent work in Persia during the war, was withdrawn in September, leaving the Persian locust authorities, much to their distress, to resume full responsibility for operations in their own country. 91. It is of some political importance that Persia should not suffer from a plague of locusts. If Persia were to lose her present self-sufficiency in bread grains, owing to the ravages of locusts, it would be impossible, in view of the present world shortage, to supply grain from outside Persia, and a famine would provide golden opportunities for subversive Tudeh activity. Again, if lorusts in Persia were liable to migrate to Soviet Turkmenistan (always a potential19 danger) this would give the Soviet Government a pretext for interfering m South-East Persia, where the locusts normally breed. This would presumably be unwelcome to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. 92. The Middle East Anti-Locust Unit is confident, however, of being able to prevent serious infestation of Persia'dby their operations in Arabia. Indian Affairs. 93. After its inauguration in Tehran in October 1944, the initial enthusiasm of the Indo-Iranian Cultural Society lasted only until June, when {a) the hot weather, (b) the dispersal to Europe of the leading Persian lights, i.e., Messrs. Hikmat, Rashid Yassemi and Hejazi, (c) the illness of the President, M. Samii (Abid us Sultaneh), (d) the aggressive Russian policy in North Persia, and (e) the successive fall of Persian Cabinets after a two to three months’ life, virtually suffocated its activities. 94. By dint of immense perseverance by the secretary (Major Naqvi, the Government of India Consul in Tehran), suitable Persian students and graduates were selected and sent off to India for long courses in'agriculture, forestry and engineering, and to take up the generous scholarships granted by the Govern ment of India. Although at first these eleven young men found it strange in India, they gradually settled down to hard work in competition with Indians with better educational qualifications and abilities than ever they could obtain in Persia. One Persian official naively pleaded that these well-meaning grants of scholarships actually embarrassed the Persian Government, for where India offered a dozen or so, the Russians forced the Persians to send forty lads to study at Baku, and all knew how those forty should serve Persia ! 95. Enquiries from private individuals—men ana women for educational facilities in India poured in and showed the need for a special Indian educa tional officer to assist the embassy in their difficult task of advising and placing these enthusiasts 96. In spite of ceaseless efforts no real progress was made in the efforts to equate Persian school and university diplomas and decrees with recognised standards in India, England, France or elsewhere in the Middle East, and this made it extremely difficult to place students anxious to go to Indian schools and universities or attend post-graduate courses. The fact is that the Persian standards are very low and the Persian Government avoids having to admit it. 97 Some time in 1944 the British Council admitted that they could not obtain English teachers to cope with the large number of requests for Anglo- Persian Institutes and English classes and so it was agreed that Indian educa tionalists should be engaged to teach English at Meshed, Kerman, Eezd and Ahwaz. After certain vicissitudes the scheme got under way, and, where the teacher is suited by his qualifications and own personality, there has been a good response. Never, however, will the scheme be the self-supporting one it was optimistically expected to be, as in these days of high cost of living in Persia, the income from tuition fees cannot be expected to cover the teachers' normal and legitimate living expenses. That the good work should continue is the opinion of the^British Council, who have assisted the teachers by giving them the benefit of their own “ refresher ” courses and other advice. The not-very-large expendi ture that may have to be borne by the Government of India is well worth while. Incidentally, it would be a heavier item had not the Indian trading community in Persia voluntarily contributed most generously in hard cash to this fund for the teaching of English. p ^ u / *i 98. After many years’ delay the Iran League of Bombay (mostly Zeroastrian) succeeded in getting to Tehran a 2-ton bronze statue of the Persian poet Firdausi, sitting on his cushion and writing his epic, the Shahnameh. The statue was promised soon after Firdausi’s millenium in 1934, but the war pre vented the export of the bronze. It is now admirably placed at the head of the avenue bearing the poet’s name and surveying the modern city of Tehran. 99. At the end of October Dr. R. E. Mortimer Wheeler, the Director- General of Archgeology in India, and his party came to Persia at the invitation of the Persian Government. He was only able to see Kerman, \ezd, Shiraz, Isfahan and Tehran before having to curtail his visit, and proceed to Iraq. In fact, his proposed visit to Meshed coincided with the Russian-sponsored coup in Azerbaijan and Persian army officer desertions in Meshed itself, and, as the Russian Charge d’Affaires naively explained when asked why Russian permits were refused, “ the time was not considered suitable for his visit ” ! Nevertheless. Dr. Wheeler was able to make valuable contacts with Persian archaeological and [77—51] D 220 educational authorities and it is certain that in the near future there will be valuable archaeological exchanges of both students and specimens between India and Persia. 100. In the autumn of 1944 the Government of India asked permission of the Persian Government to remove a number of rails from an unwanted railway siding at Mirjawa, where the train between Quetta and Zahidan ci’osses the frontier. Although these rails had been lying unused since 1931, the Persians ^ successfully procrastinated until after VJ-day and so showed in the true light their much vaunted “co-operation” and “sacrifice” for the Allies in a matter _ which, at a time when rails were in short supply, was very important for the prosecution of the war against Japan. 101. During the whole time that Indian army detachments were in Tehran the Indian Soldiers’ Welfare Association of British Indian Traders generously entertained their fellow-countrymen and made their stay in the capital as pleasant as possible. When His Highness the Maharaja of Kotah visited his infantry regiment, he had as his guest at a reception, M. Maximov, then Russian Ambassador. M. Maximov was extremely interested to meet his first Indian, and a prince at that, and naively expressed his astonishment at the quite unexpected good relations between His Majesty’s Ambassador and staff and the Maharaja and other members of the down-trodden “ slave ” races of India! Inauguration of an Indian Trade Commissioner's Office. 102. Major M. Hassan, the Indian Government’s first Trade Commissioner for Persia, assumed his duties on the 12th June, 1945. I he work of his office falls under two main heads : commercial intelligence and commercial publicity. The latter covers activities which will range from organising Indian stands and exhibitions and fairs, to the furnishing of information regarding India on a variety of subjects to official bodies, associations and individuals in Persia. An Indian information officer has recently joined for this work. Mr. IL H. Rahman, joint director of exhibitions in the Government of India, visited Tehran in the end of December 1945 for discussions in connexion with the preparations for a mobile exhibition in the Middle East countries. Although no dates are fixed as yet. it is hoped that the exhibition will come to Persia early in 1947 and will be held in all provincial centres (including those in what is now the Russian zone, if possible). The object is to give a visual demonstration, in a vivid and arresting manner, of India’s cultural traditions, general progress, industrial advancement, and her capacity for supplying many of the consumer goods and raw materials previously imported from the Axis countries. The preliminary object of the exhibition is to create a cultural understanding and to promote commercial relations between India and Persia and other Middle East countries by showing the homogeneity of India’s culture, her achievements and her capacity as a potential supplier of the needs and requirements of these countries. The main sections of the exhibition will be cultural, artistic, educational, agricultural, industrial, transport, Indian army, amusement and information. Indo-Persian Trade. 103. Indo-Persian trade in the years immediately preceding the war was not on a very extensive scale. India occupied fifth place in the returns of Persia s “ commercial ” imports and exports during those years. The lion’s share went to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Germany, next came the United States and the G T nited Kingdom, followed by India and Japan. This position has been changed by the war and India has emerged during the war as the principal supplier of consumer goods to Persia. She has also become one of the leading buyers of Persian goods. The latest statistics published by the Persian Government show that for 'the period the 22nd March, 1944, to the 21st March, 1945, India was the chief supplier of Persia’s “commercial’’ imports. In 1942I43 she supplied as much as 55 per cent, of these imports. In 1943-44 the percentage dropped to 36-51, and in 1944—45 it was 31-79. These decreases are explained by the enforcement of war-controls in India. Despite the controls in India and the import licensing procedure in this country, India remained in a dominant position in the market. India’s share of “ non-commercial ’’ imports (i e , duty-free imports by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, not recorded in the Persian statistics as “ commercial ”), was also considerable in the year 1944-45. She supplied goods approximately to the value of 31 million rials out of a total of 383 million rials. As regards Persia’s exports to India these too have been109 On the 23rd July the Persian Government recognised the Warsaw Government, and a new charge d’affaires, M. E. J. Milnikiel, presented his letters to the Persian Government on the 22nd September. Meanwhile, M. Okohski, the 21 on the increase during the war. In the year ending the 21st March, 1945, India’s share was almost equal to that of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and these two countries were the principal buyers of Persian produce (excluding mineral oil). If C£ non-commercial ” exports (mineral oil exported by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and fish exported by the Caspian fisheries) are included, India’s share of the total export trade of Persia far exceeds that of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. 104. The balance of trade was definitely in India's favour despite large imports of mineral oil by her. 105. With the end of the war trade is returning to its normal channels slowly. Some of the war controls have been withdrawn in India and Persia. For instance the Government of India is now allowing exports of natural indigo, certain chemicals and chemical preparations, scientific instruments of indigenous origin, pyridine, cashew nuts, lac, &amp;c., freely; while the Persian Government has abolished monopolies of cotton piecegoods, pharmaceutical products, jute and jute manufactures, &amp;c. Notwithstanding the fact that export controls for essential commodities are still in operation in India, a good ground has been prepared for the promotion of commercial relations between the two countries. Fmquiries received show that the goods most needed in Persia are cotton piece- goods, tea, sugar, spices, jute and jute manufactures, electrical equipment, machinery of various kinds, leather products, bicycles, toilet requisites, coir mats and mattings, sports goods, &amp;c. The desire to export more goods is keenly felt in India. Efforts are being made to increase the quotas for Persia of the goods, export of which is still controlled by the Government of India. American Affairs. 106. 'me American Ambassador, Mr. Leliand Morris, who had only been in Persia since August 1944, left on the 19th May and was replaced by MU Wallace Murray, for many years the redoubtable and hitherto rather anti-British, head of the Near East Division of the State Department. Mr. Morris was a disappoint ment. Although not mischievous like his predecessor, Mr. Dreyfus, he was inert and carried no influence. In particular he was unable to co-ordinate the activities of the American advisers, or to curb the intransigence and obstinacy of Dr. Millspaugh. 107. Mr. Murray seemed during the first few months to be in a highly nervous state, and whereas he had hitherto acted as the defender of Persian interests against British imperialism, he began to treat the Persian Minister for Foreign.Affairs in a highly arbitrary fashion whenever he could not obtain exactly what he wanted, e.g., in the matter of aviation rights. He also spoke in the most violent fashion, on no evidence, of the alleged hostility of Sayed Zia to the Shah and to Dr. Millspaugh, and it was quite evident that his criticism was really aimed at His Majesty’s Embassy. Towards the end of the year, however, he calmed down a little, perhaps because his health improved or because events began to prove to him the falsity of some of his assumptions, and a little later Mr. Bevin’s stand for Persia at the London meeting of the Security Council was to take much wind out of his sails. He suffers from the constant difficulty that he distrusts the Russians and despises the Persians, but whenever this drives him to the logical conclusion that the British are right, he has to find an excuse for not accepting it, and he therefore lives in a fog of inconsistency. French Affairs. 108. In October the French Diplomatic Mission, hitherto entitled the &lt;£ Delegation of the Provisional Government of the French Republic,” was raised to the rank of embassy, and the existing delegate, M. Pierre Lafond, presented his credentials as ambassador on the 20th October. In the same month, an office was opened in Tehran by the Agence France Presse. It became increasingly clear towards the end of the year that a general revival of French cultural influence, predominant before the war, was the purpose of the activities of the press department of the new embassy and the local director-correspondent of the agency. This revival is to be welcomed from our view, since British and French cultural propaganda support each other in strengthening the influence in Persia of Western civilisation and counteracting Soviet cultural influence. Transfer of Polish Legation to Warsaw Government.22 r charge d’affaires of the former London Polish Government, had handed his lega tion over to the Persian Government, as he refused to acknowledge the new regime. The Persian Government in turn handed it to M. Milnikiel. 110. M. Milnikiel was in peace time an inspector of schools; he was captured by the Russians in 1939 and released in 1941. He then reached Palestine, where he was court-martialled and imprisoned by the former Polish military authorities on a charge of having defamed the (London) Polish Govern- ment while in Russia. ^ Polish Refugees. 111. At the beginning of the year there were 4,435 Polish refugees in p ers i a 112. The dissolution of the Polish Government in London caused anxiety lest the refugees in Persia should be deported to Russia against their will. His Majesty’s Embassy countered this by forming a Polish Refugee Section and putting the refugees under its auspices. On the other hand their presence in a country partially occupied by the Russians was a potential source of Anglo- Russian friction and it was desirable to move them to less contentious territory. Arrangements were therefore made to transfer most of them to the Lebanon, and by the end of the year there were only about 1,150 refugees left in Persia, of whom 850 were due to leave in the next month, the remaining 300 being mainly a c £ hard-core 5 ’ looking after themselves. 113. The new Warsaw charge d'affaires explained, on arrival, that he could not at present assist any refugees to return to Poland. Nor could he maintain any refugees who adhered to his Government. He approved the move of the refugees to the Lebanon, on the grounds that repatriation to Poland would be easier from there than from Persia. His acquiescence in oar arrangements made matters politically much less difficult for us, since it minimised the prospects of Soviet misrepresentation. Retrenchment of British Propaganda Activities. 114. The peak of the activities of the embassy’s public relations bureau was reached in the late autumn of 1944. After that, with the prospect of an early end of the war in Europe, care was taken not to allow’ any extension of publicity expenditure pending direction from the Ministry of Information as to post-war policy. Indeed, several activities were stopped or curtailed before the Ministry’s instructions were received in June to cut expenditure by 25 per cent, in three months and by 50 per cent, in six months. The result of the Ministrv’s instructions is reflected in the 1945—46 budget estimates, which provide' for a net expenditure of £49,315, compared with the estimate for the year 1944-45 of £122,764. Moreover, the net expenditure for the year 1944-45 was reduced to £80,616, a saving of no less than £42,148 on the estimated expenditure. , , ... • j, 115. At the beginning of 1945, the bureau s activities w^ere organised under the following heads :— (i) Press attache section. (ii) Films section. (iii) Allied liaison section. (iv) Daily news section. (v) Broadcasting section. (vi) Visual publicity and distribution section. 116 By the end of the year only three senior British officers were provided for in the budget (the director, the press attache and an administrative officer whose post is still vacant). Apart from these three, the only British personnel remaining (out of a total of twenty-six at the beginning of 1945) are the editor of the daily news bulletin and the registrar. 117. During the summer of 1945 the press attache s section ceased the publication of their women’s magazine— Alame Zenan —as it was not very successful. Publication of the Tafsir-i-Khabarha-yi-Jehan (World News Review) and of the very successful children’s newspaper—Vow Nehalan-Ai&amp;s been continued. . .. . rp , , 118 The films section operated seven mobile cinema vans m lehran and the provinces for most of the year, but will in future only operate five. In addition until late in the vear, the bureau operated a newsreel cinema m theheart of the capital. The cinema has been handed back to its proprietor upon condition that he shows at least three public relations bureau reels with each change of programme and upon tihe terms that he pays the bureau 20 per cent, of his net takings. This has proved to be a most remunerative arrangement without any loss of publicity value in giving up the cinema. 119. The Allied liaison section was closed down in the early spring. 120. The newspaper Tehran Daily News had always been a heavy drain on ^the bureau’s financial resources and it would have been difficult to justify its survival, upon political grounds, after the evacuation of American and British troops from Tehran. It therefore published its final number in mid-October. In its place a daily roneo’d news bulletin is published with a circulation something short of 1,000, some 674 of which are paid for by subscribers. 121. The broadcasting section continued to put out its daily half-hour programme—the Voice of Britain—on Radio Tehran until the 21st March, 1945, when the half-hour was officially handed back to the Persian authorities. The Russians continued to broadcast tendentious material from Radio Tehran under the cover of the Irano-Russian Cultural Society’s programme. In July they broadcast a particularly obnoxious quotation from Pravda commenting viciously on Persian internal affairs, and their programme was interrupted by the Persians, who thereupon prohibited all foreign broadcasts, only allowing one to continue—the Russian! At least their action, unexpectedly courageous, had one good result—the Russians have never again used Radio Tehran to broadcast directly offensive material. But the British Council English lessons by radio had not started again by the end of the year although the Government of Prime Minister Sadr had promised that they might start again. 122. The visual publicity and distribution section ceased towards the end of the year to produce its own publicity displays and now concentrates upon the preparation of photographic material received from Cairo and London for the Victory House windows and the reading rooms in the provinces. British Council. 123. The British Council continued to expand its activities. The total number of pupils being taught English went up from 4,000 to 4,600 and the only limitation was shortage of British personnel. 124. The council consulted the Foreign Office as to the desirability oi opening two new Anglo-Persian institutes in the provinces, one at Kermanshah and one, if circumstances were politically propitious, at Tabriz or Meshed. The Foreign Office replied that they thought it enough if the council’s estimates for 1946 contained provision for one new institute, and that it should be decided after the 2nd March, the date fixed for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Persia, whether this institute should be in Tabriz, Meshed or Kermansbah. 125. Expansion of the council’s activities in Persia is most desirable, particularly as the public relations bureau of the embassy is retrenching. The council is popular with Persians, having, one is thankful to say, remained free of suspicion of dabbling in politics, in spite of the many possibilities of malevolent misrepresentation by Persians or Russians.86-105 B .n u V I-1 THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC^MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT CONFIDENTIAL (17204) E 1346/40/34 IW^XED 4 TT' PERSIA February 13, 1947 CONff Section 1 Copy No. 165 ANNUAL POLITICAL REPORT ON PERSIA, 1946 Sir J.

Enclosure Political Report on Persia, 1946 j During 1946 the energy and ingenuity of the Persian Government have been mainly directed to foiling the Soviet plan , to turn this country into a Russian protec- 5 torate. In the closing weeks of the year j their efforts were crowned with sudden i success and for the time being Soviet 5 influence in Persia is at a lower ebb than it has been since 1941. 2. Long before the end of 1945 the obvious reluctance of the Soviet Govern ment to commit themselves to any pro gramme of military evacuation had created grave suspicion about their ultimate intentions. The conference of Foreign Ministers at Moscow in December failed to provide a solution, and in January Hussein Ala, the Persian delegate at U.N.O., was then instructed by his Government to appeal to the Security Council. A few days later the Prime Minister, Hakimi, appalled at his own temerity, resigned and was succeeded by Qavam-es-Saltaneh, who was supported by a majority of only one vote in the Majlis. Qavam was the nominee of the Soviet Embassy and of the Tudeh Party, which had already fallen under Communist control. It was his policy to reach a direct understanding with Russia, and he promptly opened negotiations with Moscow to that end. He did not cancel his predecessor’s instruc tions to Ala, but the Security Council decided to defer consideration of the Persian appeal until the outcome of Qavam's approach to the Soviets could be seen. 3. On 18th February Qavam visited Moscow but achieved nothing, and on 2nd March, by the date on which they had undertaken to withdraw the last of their troops from Persian soil, the Soviet Government announced their decision to postpone evacuation. 4. A few days later, amid violent demon strations of hostility from gangs of hooligans organised by the Tudeh Party, the statutory life of the Fourteenth Majlis expired. The Prime Minister thus escaped the necessity to make any public statement about his negotiations with the Soviet Government, but he told His Majesty’s Ambassador that he had found them cold and arrogant. They had flatly refused to withdraw their troops on the scheduled date and demanded full autonomy for Azerbaijan in addition to a concession to prospect for oil throughout North Persia. Qavam, in his turn, then made an appeal to the Security Council, in which he denounced the failure of the Soviet Government to withdraw their troops. 5. On 19th March the new Soviet Ambassador, M. Sadtchikov, arrived in Tehran and, under pressure from the Security Council, negotiations were resumed. A few days later, certain Red army units were withdrawn as a concilia tory gesture, and on 5th April a joint com munique was issued over the signatures of Qavam and Sadtchikov in the following sense. It was agreed that the Red army should evacuate Persian territory com pletely within six weeks from 24th March and that within seven months from the same date legislation would be introduced to establish a joint Perso-Soviet company for the exploitation of oil resources inPersia. The Persian Government under took, moreover, to settle the Azerbaijan question in a peaceful manner and in a spirit of benevolence towards the people of that province. At the same time the Prime Minister exchanged notes with the Soviet Ambassador, defining in general terms the nature of the joint company and the con ditions under which it was to operate. 6. At this stage the Prime Minister agreed to withdraw the Persian Govern ment’s appeals to the Security Council. The Red army was completely evacuated within a few days of the date specified in the communique, and the Persian Govern ment were left to grapple as best they might with the puppet regime at Tabriz which the Russians had left behind on their withdrawal. It was clear that at this stage the Soviet Government had no inten tion of relaxing their political stranglehold on Azerbaijan and the Caspian Provinces, although they had felt obliged, under pressure from the Security Council, to agree to a military evacuation. 7. On 23rd April Qavam published a decree in which the Government stated their intention of interpreting the organic law so as to ensure various powers and privileges for Azerbaijan, including the right of the Provincial Council to make senior departmental appointments and to be consulted about the selection of the Governor-General. The Central Govern ment reserved full power to appoint the commanders of military and gendarmerie forces in the province. Elementary schools were to be allowed to use Turki and ade quate funds were to be assigned for social services. The province would also have the right to increased representation in the Majlis, corresponding to the growth of its population. , . 8. This decree, which formed the basis of subsequent discussions with the Azer baijanis, had been approved by the Russians before it was enacted. Yet, not withstanding the fact that the Azerbaijan delegation were under direct Soviet con- trol the £ ‘ negotiations which followed dragged on through various stages until November. The reason why this game of double-dummy was so inordinately pro tracted is a matter for speculation, but it is more than likely that the essential condition of success, not stated m the Government communique, was m tact the inclusion of a hard core of Azerbaijani Democrats in the Central Government. Onlv when such aspirations became patently futile did the negotiations finally break down. 9. At the beginning of May, Jafar Pishavari, the leader of the Azerbaijan Democrat Party, came to Tehran for discussions and returned to Labriz a fortnight later empty-handed. In June a delegation led by the Prime Minister’s chief assistant, Muzafiar Firuz, visited , Tabriz and it was officially announced that an agreement had been reached on the basis of the Government decree of 23rd April. But, from the explanatory memorandum published simultaneously, it was clear that no solution of the fundamental question of the armed forces had been reached. 10. The substitution of political for military pressure on the Central Govern ment from Azerbaijan coincided with a rapid development of Tudeh activity in other parts of Persia and particularly in the capital and in Khuzistan. On 1st May Labour Day was celebrated in Abadan by a demonstration of Tudeh supporters on a scale which took the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company by surprise. There was no dis order, but, from this time on, it became clear that the party was preparing for a trial of strength with the company and that months of underground activity had resulted in the creation of a powerful organisation. The company, who had hitherto felt secure in the knowledge that their workers were better paid and far better treated than those in other parts of Persia, was suddenly exposed to a blast of fiercely hostile propaganda, which exploited every weak point in their organi sation in the'most unscrupulous manner. The main purpose of the party was clearly not to secure better conditions for the workers but to undermine the company’s authority. Owing to the rapid increase of output during the war, the provision ol many normal amenities, and even essentials such as housing, had failed to keep pace with requirements and, in consequence, a number of workers were living under emer- o-ency conditions. In spite of every effort on the part of the company, there was bound to be a considerable delay m making o-ood these deficiencies. The local Tudeh, inspired and directed by the Soviet Consul- General at Ahwaz, proceeded to exploit this situation. At the end of May a strike was declared at Agha Jari, a field whic had undergone particularly rapid expan sion during the war and where living con ditions of the workers were particularly inadequate. The pretext was a demand for an increase of pay and the substitution of money for certain payments m kind inspired no doubt by the belief that oo prices would soon be stabilised or evena decline. Thanks to the devotion of the British staff production was maintained, but, after a fortnight, the company decided to accede to the workers’ demands rather than to risk a general strike. 11 . There followed a period of uneasy ^equilibrium, during which more effective ^^ecurity measures were imposed by the Central Government as a result of repre sentations by His Majesty’s Ambassador. On the other hand Tudeh propaganda against the company continued unabated and even increased in violence. The entire Persian press, both in Khuzistan, in the capital and elsewhere, was mobilised for this purpose. In the chorus of denuncia tion no discordant voice was heard and there could be no doubt that matters were about to come to a head. Finally, in the middle of it all, just as the newly created Labour Council in Tehran was on the point of agreeing, with Tudeh participation, to a basis for the calculation of a minimum wagre, the Tudeh leaders at Abadan declared a general strike. On the first day certain Arab contractors, who were sus pected of engaging in anti-Tudeh activi ties, were brutually murdered and wide spread disorder was only averted by the coolness and determination of the military Governor, Major Fateh, who promptly arrested the leading Tudeh agitators. This strike was called off two days later, as a result of the personal intervention of the Prime Minister’s deputy, Muzaffar Firuz, who released the Tudeh leaders and per suaded the company to grant part of the workers’ demands. The cost to the com pany was no greater than they were pre pared to incur in the ordinary process of law, but, owing to the manner in which the settlement was forced upon them, the blow to their authority was considerable. On the other hand, the reckless and undisci plined behaviour of the Tudeh Party did them much harm in the eyes of many of their own supporters. 12. While the strike was in progress H.M.S. Norfolk and H.M.S. Wild Goose were ordered to lie in the Shatt-el-Arab off Abadan and their presence undoubtedly had a sobering and reassuring effect. But, although previous notification was given, the Persian Government reacted strongly and protested that, if the arrival of these vessels was connected with the strike, it would be considered an unfriendly act. At the beginning of August it was decided to send an Indian Brigade Group to Basra for the protection of British and Indian lives, should circumstances require it. The Persian Government did not protest officially on this occasion, but the Prime Minister expressed his concern privately to His Majesty’s Ambassador and also the hope that this force would shortly be with drawn. He was given soothing assurances and was informed that there was no truth in reports that these troops had been ordered to enter Persia. Appreciation was also expressed for the effective measures taken by the Persian authorities .to main tain order throughout Khuzistan. 13. Early in July, the Prime Minister announced the formation of a new party, to be known as the Democrat Party of Persia, which would be identified with him self and the members of his Government. In Persia, however, as elsewhere, it is felt that the Government should be formed by a party and not vice versa. There was also widespread misgiving about the composi tion of the party and the programme it would adopt. In particular, more respon sible conservative elements were dismayed at the prominent part played in its organisation by Muzaffar Firuz, who, during six months of office as the Prime Minister’s chief assistant and deputy, seemed to be acquiring a dangerous ascendancy over his master. A shallow and unscrupulous political adventurer, Firuz has lived for many years in England. He was educated at Harrow and had formerly been associated with Sayyed Zia, whose policy was consistently friendly to Britain. He acquired office on the crest of a pro-Soviet wave and sought to ingratiate himself with the Russians by his antagonism to all things British, veiled only by insolent professions of friendship towards members of the embassy staff and any other Englishmen he might happen to meet. 14. At the beginning of August, the Prime Minister decided to extend the base of his Government by including three members of the Tudeh Party. At the same time, a new Ministry, that of Labour and Propaganda, was established under Muzaffar Firuz, who, moreover, retained his previous function as chief assistant to the Prime Minister. A few days later, the text of a communique was published in the press over the Prime Minister’s signature, which placed a ban on all unofficial contact between members of the public and foreign embassies or consulates. Foreign missions were never officially informed of this boy cott which no doubt was a piece of window- dressing for the benefit of the Soviet Embassy, whose widespread contacts b 2 86-1054 through the Communist Party would be unaffected by it. It was only observed in certain districts and soon became a dead letter. 15. The concessions which the Govern ment seemed prepared to make to the Azerbaijanis acted as an incentive to autonomous movements in other parts of the country. A complicating factor in the Abadan strike had been the emergence of a separatist Arab movement in Khuzistan, responsibility for which was quite unjustly fastened on His Majesty’s Government, and the murder of a number of Arabs which followed only added fuel to the flame. In August it became known to His Majesty’s Consuls at Isfahan and Shiraz that the BaJkhtiari and Kashgai Khans were plotting to seize control of those cities and to destroy the Tudeh organisa tion in tha area. Eventually, Abul Qasim Bakhtiari turned King’s evidence. Muzaffar Firuz thereupon flew to Isfahan and arrested other leading members of the Bakhtiari clan. On the strength of state ments extracted from them and from Abul Qasim. he then made a public announce ment which implied that the conspiracy w T as largely the work of British agents, and in particular of His Majesty’s Consul- General at Ahwaz, Mr. Trott, who had visited Isfahan shortly before the plot was revealed. An official request was made for Mr. Trott’s recall. His Majesty’s Ambas sador was instructed to press for the pro duction of any evidence on which these allegations might be based or alternatively for an official retraction. Neither was forthcoming, but early in October the Secretary of State made a statement in the House of Commons which was previously agreed with the Persian Government, roundly disclaiming the suggestion that there had been interference in Persian affairs The request for Mr. Trott’s recall w r as then dropped. 16. Meanwhile, the threatened rising in Fars came to a head. For this purpose Naser Khan Kashgai concerted with Hiat Daudi and the coastal tribes at Bushire. The garrisons of Government troops in the area were isolated and reduced and, on the 29th September, Bushire fell. A punitive column eventually reached Shiraz, but could not proceed further and the High Command were accused, not without some reason, of welcoming this opportunity to demonstrate to the country the need for a firmer policy, particularly in Azerbaijan. By the middle of October fighting had ceased and an uneasy truce supervened. 17. Negotiations with the Azerbaijanis on outstanding points was resumed in August and dragged on in desultory fashion during September. There was no sign of real progress, but time appeared to be on the side of the Prime Minister until, on 3rd October, the Soviet Ambas sador abruptly warned him that he had no more than three weeks in which to imple- ^ ment his undertaking to introduce oil ^ legislation into the Fifteenth Majlis. In' the name of his Government, M. Sadtchikov demanded that elections be held forthwith. He would hear nothing of the Prime Minister’s protest that the Azerbaijan question must be settled first. On 5th October the election decree was issued and the Tudeh Party began intensive agitation for the formation of a “ democratic front ’ ’ to include the Democrat Party of Persia, the Azerbaijan Democrats, the Tudeh themselves and one or two minor groups. The Prime Minister at first seemed inclined to toy with this dangerous proposal, but attempts to divide repre sentation in the new Majlis in advance of the election broke down owing to the refusal of the Tudeh to accord his party more than 55 out of 136 seats. 18. At this stage the Shah intervened and prevailed upon the Prime Minister to reform his Government without the three ^ Tudeh Ministers and, no less significant, without the egregious Muzaffar Firuz, who, much against his will, was forced to accept the Moscow Embassy. This deci sion, for which the Shah deserves no less, and perhaps more credit than the Prime Minister, proved to be an important turning-point. It was followed by the interruption of negotiations with the Azerbaijan Delegation who returned to Tabriz early in November, and by the announcement that Government inspectors, supported by armed forces, would be sent into all provinces (including Azerbaijan) to ensure the fair and orderly conduct of the elections, and, a little later, by the reoccupation of Zenjan. In spite of the agitation of certain religious leaders and conservative elements in favour of a post ponement of the elections, of a crescendo of protest from Tabriz and, finally, of several very blunt warnings from the Soviet Ambassador, the Prime Minister pursued his programme undeterred. On 10th December, Government troops crossed the border into Azerbaijan. On the following day, the Democrat regime disintegrated and Pishavari and a number of his associates and supporters fled across the Soviet frontier. Tabriz was occupied on 13th December, and in less than a week the whole of Azerbaijan and Kurdistan were under the effective control of the CentralGovernment. Resistance had been neglig ible and the population of the province welcomed the arrival of Government forces with undisguised enthusiasm. At a single stroke the head of the alien octopus had been severed and its essential feebleness ^exposed. 19. It is still too soon to assess with any certainty the factors underlying this spec tacular collapse. In some quarters it has been suggested that there is a sinister understanding between Qavam and the Russians, of which this country will before long have reason to repent. In others the Prime Minister is depicted as a reluctant passenger swept along to victory by the Shah and his general staff. The truth may well be that the Russians have once again misjudged imponderables and have under rated the ineptitude of their puppets no less than the determination of the Shah, his Prime Minister and his people to have done with all the mummery of compulsory progress and to win back the threadbare independence of their backward country. 20. With the reoccupation of Azer baijan the stage was set for a general election and everything pointed to a land slide in favour of the Prime Minister and his party. The Tudeh Party had for the time being ceased to be a factor of importance and the chief opposition to Qavam now came from those who had dominated the 14th Majlis, but could not or would not find a place in the Prime Minister’s new party. In their dilemma these disgruntled, heterogeneous elements looked to the Shah for approval and sup port, and it may be that they will not look in vain. The personal relations between the Shah and his Prime Minister, though outwardly correct, are, in fact, precarious. By sinking their personal differences for a time they undoubtedly turned the political tide, but if they drift apart again the outlook for Persia will be bleak indeed.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00001b_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3472A</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00001b</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3472A</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 28/67 ‘Persia.
