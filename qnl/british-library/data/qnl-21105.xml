I received yesterday letter from Yusuf Yasin 4n reply to my letter of September 26th. Text, of which following is summary, sent by bag today. 2* Letter expresses surprise that His Majesty’s Government should view direct correspondence with Shaikh of Qatar with disapproval and in so doing should rely on Article VI of Treaty of Jedda. Yusuf Yasin quotes phrase in my letter (paragraph 7 of your telegram) ’•Ibn Saud undertook amongst other things to maintain friendly relations with Shaikh of Qatar M etcetera pointing out what he terms difference in text wk4e and significance to Article VI which he quotes in full. He asserts that Article VI contains no reference to any undertaking by Ibn Saud not to corresponds with Shaikhs, with whom relations since Treaty have remained on same friendly Das is as before, with exchange of correspondence ensuring maintenance of those relations, treaties refer ed to in Article VI viz thosebetween His Majesty’s Government and Shaikhs may be binding on latter but not on Saudi Government. 3# Regarding His Majesty’s Government’s preparedness to offer concession in derogation of their strict legal Telegram From To Repeated rights- 2 - rights, letter declares that Saudi Government’s desire has always been for relations of friendship with Shaikhs; that they have no desire to exert pressure on them; and have shown readiness to concede territory to utmost limit (mut) whole of shch domains were formerly subject to Ibn Baud’s forefathers. Saudi Go ernment cannot recognise legal rights to which His Majesty’s Government now pretend and cannot accept them as a basis for discussion in regard to frontiers. Saudi Government therefore reserve their rights in territories and places which they cannot *gree to renounce and in privileges granted in those places. 4. Saudi Government are fully prepared at any time to discuss settlement of question of frontiers animated by spirit of friendship for neighbouring Amirs# CALVERTG.T.C Telegram:- From:- To:- Hepeated:- Air Head Quarters, Rinaldi.

After refreshments and coffee the Ehaikh landed. When asking if it would be convenient for the Shaikh if I paid his return I in call at once said that I would land again^the evening for business but that if the Shaikh (who was living at Raiyan) preferred to talk business at the return call, the Captain and officers (who had been invited to liich) would land later on. The Shaikh jumped at doing business at once. I returned the Shaikh’s call on shore immediately after the Shaikh landed. 2. Before even serving doffee the Shaikh opened the conversation about Ibn Sa’ud’s letter, saying that he had received a letter of Salams (No*99/1/30 dated the 6th Jamad al Auwal 1364, i.e. 6th August 1936) from King Bin Sa’ud and which had a ’MULHAQ 1 with it (No .99/1/31) which was an important one and which he wanted to show to me. 3. King Bin Sa'ud had threatened to stop operations by the Oil Company in Qatar and the Shaikh wanted to know whether he could do so. I asked him how he thought that Bin Sa r ud would try to stop it, and he said that he did not know but was obviously afraid of tribal trouble. I reassured him. The Shaikh continued that boundaries of Qatar were well-known and ran from *AL MASHIBIYAH 1 near Salwah to Khaur al *Udaid. He was not certain about the real intention of '•/VP King Bin Sa’ud, but thought that he is trying to get the British sphere and wanted to use this as means of pressure* The Shaikh said that he had replied that he was not concerned with matters beyond his territory and that the question of the Turks * treaty with the High Government was a matter to be settled by Government, that the boundaries of Qatar are well- known and that he had already granted the concession and could not go back on it. He expected that Bin Sa’ud would sendback a reply but he was not sure about his attitude. The Shaikh asked that our knowledge of the letter might be kept secret, as when his letter reached Bin Sa*ud and he learnt from it that he had already given the concession, he might change his attitude. I said that I would communicate the contents of the letter to His Majesty^ Government and ask their advice in the matter. Also that I would tell them that he wanted the matter kept secret, but that it was for them to do what was best in his interests and assured him that Government would do their best to safeguard his interests. In the course of the interview I asked him to let me know of Bin Sard’s reply, if it came, and of any other developments at once. 28.8.35Telegram G.T.C From fiir Headquarters, ’Iraq Command, Bagdad via H.M.S.Shoreham. political Resident, Bushire.

His Majesty’s Government have carefully considered position reached in negotiations and see little prospect of reaching settlement, which they regard as very desirable, more especially in riew of existing international situation in Red Sea area, unless far acre extensive offer is made to Ibn Saud, than that hitherto ;Pntemplated. They have never denied that Murra tribe was predominatly under Uaudi influence and propose now to accept [bn Saud’s authority over this tribe as one of main factors in the situation. Political Agent, Kuwait, has now received inform t ion from Beduin with Murra connections which shows (a) that great number Df wells on Fuad Hamza’s list are probably Murra. wells; (b) that lira of Murra tribe extends in south-east to Sabhkat Mijora which is not shown on maps but appears on sketch.map furnished by Political Agent as approximately at intersection of parallel 20 and meridian 54. From this point tribal boundary runs in south-westerly curve to point apparently tv/enty to twenty-five miles south of Shanna whence it proceeds in north-westerly curve cutting violet line. I * 1 these circumstances His Majesty’s Government consider flbn Saud might now be offered an area which in north, east and south will correspond closely with Murra dira. It is not proposed to oifer Dim severeighty over Murra dira as such but rather to make latest information basis of new and final offer while££\q i Or | )9 3 3 V &gt;- HACi. advancing positive claims of British proteges as irremovable obstacles to any Saudi demand for extenstion of this very reasonable and generous proposal* 5. This proposal will entail substantial concessions to Ibn Saud in northern sector but in south it will not involve (and there is no intention of offering) concession of any territory to south of line running from intersection of violet line ana parallel 18 to intersection of merida^n 52 and parallel 19 (area north of which has already been offered)and thence to intersection of meridian 54 and parallel 2C. This should m^et your minimum requirements as set forth in paragraph 8 of Ingrams 1 note of ^ 19th August accompanying your despatch under reference. 4. His Majesty’s Minister at wedda will visit Ibn Saud at ' Riyadh in November and it is very desirable that fresh instructions should be ready before he leaves England about | 25th October.

Yoiir^^iegram to Government of India dated October 26th, No:895, and Government of Pndia telegram dated October °*jth, 1361. You will have seen from my telegram No:3450 that I agree with your view that to put boundary as far east as meridian 56 would not give us requisite margin. 2. I see certain objection however to your (? proposals ?) regarding edge of great sands. If frontier were simply defined thus in Treaty position would be uncertain and unsatisfactory since sands opposite presumably shift and very likely increase. On the other hand fact that frontier by a cartographical line along present position edge of great sands would be involved an accurate survey which is obviously impracticable. Present edge of great sands would also apparently give Bin Sa T ud even more tnan he himself claims in north-east. Only possible course seems uo be to adhere to decision reached that frontier should be defined by cartographical lines between fixed co-ordinates but so drawn up as to take account so far as possible of tribal distributions, strategical considerations and known geographical features. It is hardly practicable at this late stage to reconsider whole question with a view to substituting different methods of definition. 3. Ky conclusions therefore are that:-(a) • On eastern sector there is no advantage in suggesting alteration of His Majesty*s Government T s present decision to offer meridian 55; (b) . On northern sector little advantage is likely to be gained by ^*och raising with Shaikh of Abu Dhabi question of offering edge of great sands. But in any case I trust he will concentrate primarily upon securing answers to enquiries regarding key points recapitulated in paragraph 6 of my telegram 5386.

After rolonged discussions with Shaikh of Abu Dhabi in the'presence of his family especially his aged uncle Shaikh Khaiifah who. is experienced in tribal matters they express willing agreement with line described below. Most references are to Thomas , map but exact positions of.places are often doubtful. I have therefore supplemented geographical terms (which are mine) by allotting number of places in vicinity of lines to each party. (i) . Line^ running north from Oasr Salwah (which will pertain to sp n Sa ! ud) to sea three-quarters mile s’ ay (this line meets sea about one-and-half miles east of very well defined head of Dohat Salwah). (ii)• Sine running approximately east by south from Casr Salwah to Khor al Odaid as far as meridian 51 leaving rocky ground and hills of Barr al Qatar to Qatar and sandy ground south to Bin Sa T ud. Line running approximately south from intersection in (ii) to Haluwain leaving Sabakhah al Amra, Khafus, Rims, Farhud, Aqalat al Lanasir, Duwaihin and Haldiala to Abu Dhabi; and Bakak, Ambak, \Iil %/ DeIrish, Raghuwan and Haluwain to Bin Sa'ud. ■ ^ viv, . Line running approximately south-east from Haluwain to intersection of meridian 53 and latitude 22 leaving Yinaiyif, Hqda, Adaiyin, iiijhut, Habaran, _Qara to Bin Sa f ud; and ILLjan, Sufuk, Sabakhat al -u tti. Hmm al Ama.d, Abu Ruwawil, Eil Hanna, Al Khubba, Khor TuwaIrish and Qurain (not marked on map. but is place to which Shaikh attaches much importance in vicinity of group of five places mentioned immediately before it) to Abu Dhabi.(v) . i^ine running east from intersection of meridian 55 and latitude 22 to intersection of meridian 55 and latitude 22 leaving Ramlat Ghasaiv.ara to Abu Dhabi. . Shaikh claims places allotted to him in (iii) above on grounds that they are near coast which indubitably belongs to him, they are on the D ohah to Dhabi route and are frequented by his liana sir. He regards Sakak and Ambak areas as having belonged to Abu Dhabi in the past but recognises that they now pertain to B in Sa f ud. I think that it is probable that Bin Sa T ud may oress claims to these places allocated to Abu Dhabi on the ground of use by A1 Morrah. There is I consider some ground for this contention nowadays, but in spite of this I think that we should support Abu Dhabi because places are more or less of one grouo and so near the sea that if they were to be handed over to Bin Se T ud it would in practice be almost impossible to urevent him * absorbing coast. I regard this as real danger. 5. Shaikh claims places allotted to him in Civ) on ground that Mijan and Sabakhat al Lfetti are coastal areas and on Qata.r to Abu Dhabi route and are used by his Manasir and Bani Yes. cufuk is term meaning line where hilly country merges in salt nwrsh of Sabakhah. Sufuk in.question runs south from sea on • est side of Sabakhat al Iktti. About ten miJ.es fpom 7 sea are wells known as Sufuk where travellers water on road to Abu Dhabi before crossing Sabakhat al Aetti. Remaining places mentioned ere claimed to be in area principally of Bani Yas and Danasir. Cura in, Khor TuwaIrish and -ijhut may be items 29, 52 end 46 in Fuad Fey T s list of July 3thT^~ 4. I should perhaps add that in each case Abu Dhabi claims 're made also on the general ground of old and known ownership. Shaikh emphasises that though Rashid bin lani 1 lives at HofuT his sons reside in Liwa and Fb.nasir are properly an Abu Dnabi tribe. 6. Shaikh npkes no repetition no claim south of latitude ^ or east of line running, south from intersection of /latitudelatitude ^ and meridian 55, but he tells ne that Ramlct Ghafa and Ghanim are used by Ay: e.mix from vicinity of Dhufar. It is therefore just possible that ^ultan of Muscat may claim rights in those areas, but perhaps saving clause recommended in para- granh 3 of ny telegram of S'^nd September, 8j34, might be held to cover any such claim. I venture to think that line nov; proposed constitutes very real concession to Bin Sa T ud while safeguarding coast and and' essential interests of Crucial Oman.© Telegram:- G.T.C.

I therefore hoped that Kis jesty ! s Govern ments line (even though geographical along that stretch) might be qualified by statement that ail Live fell to -^bu Dhabi in the same way as north-western line in paragraph 2 of your telegram of November 14th, 354, was qualified by mention of certain places.

So far as I can judge further proposed concession to Din 5a ud does not make essential difference. I would hesitate to press too strongly /bu Dhabi claims to above places (provided saving clause gives Abu Dhabi tribes free access) as I infer from certain remarks let fall during the conversations that they have latterly been allowed to become more or less derelict.

Ibn Sa*ud has advanced a claim to a wide area in South-Eastern Arabia extending for example to meridian 56 degrees between parallels 22 degrees and 19 degrees, and to a line from the intersection of medirian 56 degrees and parallel 19 degrees to the intersection of meridian 52 degrees and parallel 17 degrees. His Majesty # s Government are not prepared to recognise the whole of these claims, which in the South certainly would encroach on territory which they recognise as appertaining to the iultan. His Majesty's Government, however, see no objection to recog nising Ibn Sa'ud's claim to an area in the Great Sands extending Eastward at any rate as far as meridian 55 degrees between parallels 22 degrees and 20 degrees and in the South to a line drawn from the latter intersection to the intersection of meridian 52 degrees and parallel 19 degrees.

The undertaking of H.M.the King of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its Depen- -dencies is confined to friendiy and peaceful relations with the Amirs of t hose territories (li t.directions) and it does not contain any reference to any undertaking by Hisa WKHM 2. Hie l^ajesty ; ;?. and that he should not correspond with them or that they should not correspond with him, and therefore nothing has been changed since the ireaty of ,c Jedda in the rfcltaions which had existed between His Majesty* and those ^mirs, but friendly and peaceful relations remained complete arid perfect and correspondence is exchanged between nis Majesty and them in respect of various affairs, because this assures the friendly and peaceful relations which His Majesty undertook to main- -tain. xhe treaties referred to in Article 6, con- deluded between the British Government and those iunirs are the concern of the Amirs, and they may bind them with them but the cannot bind our Govein- -ment with them. As regards your reference to (the fact) that the British Government in accordance wi th their desire isle to deprive themselves of their strict legal rights, and offer a part of those rights to the ^audi Arab Government etc., (lit. to the end of your statement on the subject], I am glad to draw your attention ih this respect to the true facts that our Government always desires that their relations v;ith the Amirs of those territories (lit. directions] should be lasting relations of affection and friendship, and do not desire to restrict (lit.press , upon) them and their affairs and they (S.A.G] showed their readiness to grant them areas (territories! to the utmost extent which can be granted, on the under- - standing that the whole of those domains were previously subject to the fathers and forefathers of ms Majesty s the King Abdul Aziz. a B regards the legal rights to whichwhich you refer and to which the British Government pretend our Government cannot recognise and accept them and cannot consider them as basis for any dis- -cussion in connection with those frontiers. In respect of the above our Government therefore pre- -serve their fullest rights in the territories and places which Ahey cannot agree to renounce in favour of the ^rairs of those territories and (in regard to) all privileges or rights which may be granted at those reserved places, our Government cannot recognise or agree to them, and record their reservation in their regard. i'hia is on the one hand and on the other I am pleased to inform you that our Government are fully prepared at any time to discuss the settlement of the question of the frontiers in a spirit of affection and friendship to those neighbouring Amirs whenever di s- -cussion may be resumed on this subject. v/ith highest regards, l s*d) rusuf Yasin.No. 2748/229/18, HIS Majesty's Char G £ d’AiXulre* at j cdda presents his compliments to the Political Agent at Bahrain, and has the honour to transmit to him the under-mentioned documents.

Section E 6087/77/91] tiir Samuel Hoare to Sir A. Ryan (on leave). r) Sir ’ T Foreign Office, October 23, 1935. Hlfe Majesty s Government are anxious to take advantage of your forth coming visit to King Abdul Aziz at Riyadh to resume, and if possible to advance, the negotiations which have been proceeding for a settlement of the eastern and south-eastern boundaries of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Indeed, it is probable that King Abdul Aziz himself will raise this question with you at an earlv stage, as I understand that it is one on which he feels strongly; and it is in tact the most important major question at issue between this country and Saudi Arabia at the present time. 2. \qu will recollect that after His Majesty’s Government had decided not to take their stand, so long as negotiations were proceeding, on a rigid adherence to the legal basis provided by the frontier laid down in this region by the Anglo- Turkish agreements of 1913-14, you were instructed, in November 1934, to open negotiations with the Saudi Government for an agreed settlement of this question by endeavouring in the first place to obtain an exact statement of King Abdul Aziz’s territorial claim^ The Saudi/response^fo your enquiry was delayed for several months, but/the- Saudi GovcT»nmeftt~ eventually furnished you, on the 3rd April last, with a memorandum putting forward a claim to a vast area in South-Eastern Arabia, which was asserted to correspond to the areas frequented by certain tribes owing allegiance to King Abdul Aziz. You were already aware from the previous consideration which His Majesty’s Government had given to the matter that they were unable to entertain such extensive demands,* and you therefore proceeded immediately to the next stage contemplated in your instruc tions and offered to Saudi Arabia a small strip of territory—the so-called “green line ” concession—immediately to the east of the Anglo f urkishrboundary. ° The subsequent departure of the Deputy Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs from Jedda rendered an immediate continuance of negotiations impossible, but the discussions were resumed with Fuad Bey Hamza himself during his visit to London last summer. 3. Despite the offer which was then made by His Majesty’s Government of a further territorial concession (bounded by the so-called “ brown line ”), it unfortunately proved impossible to reconcile the divergencey between the point of view of His Ma jesty’s Government (as then agreed upon between all the various departments of His Majesty’s Government concerned) and that of King Abdul Aziz, and, on Fuad Bey’s departure towards the end of July, the discussions closed in w r hat appeared to be a complete deadlock. 4. It was explained to the Saudi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs during the course of these discussions that His Majesty’s Government were prepared, with a view to reaching an amicable settlement, to make limited ^cessions, to the east of the 1913-14 boundary, of territory which, like that contained^m the areas already offered to the King, could be shown to be predominantly utilised by tribes or settlements recognising his sovereignty. His Majesty’s Government considered, however, that no satisfactory or durable frontier could be constructed on a purely tribal basis, in view of the shifting allegiance of the nomad tribes and of their wide and overlapping migrations. Dibal considerations were valuable wdiere it could be shown that an area was predominantly or exclusively frequented by a certain tribe with an exclusive political allegiance, but historical, geographical and strategic considerations w °uld also have to be taken into account. The object of His Majesty’s Govern- ment was not to establish a rigid frontier in the European sense, but to work out a boundary as equitable as could be attained from all points of view, which 8167 [12260] b•J would remove a source of uncertainty and friction by defining the territorial limits within which Saudi Arabia and the other Arab States concerned would respectively be free to exercise full sovereignty. Fuad Bey Hamza replied that his Government considered that the only basis for a settlement was to establish and allocate the grazing grounds in accordance with the political allegiance of the desert tribes concerned. He maintained that the statement of King Abdul Aziz’s demands was drawn up on the basis of the grazing grounds of four tribal groups, in particular of the widespread Ahl Murra tribe^ w^ a^npwl^iged Saudi sovereignty; and, in support of the line claimecV he^omt^unicafea^the names of 161 wells said to be owned by that tribe. Fuad Bey criticised the concessions offered by His Majesty’s Government as being purely arbitrary and not in accordance with the material facts of the situation in the desert. The Saudi Government had, he said, worked out, after the most searching investiga tion and enquiry, a carefully plotted and rational boundary which took account of the political and tribal situation, and they were prepared to provide detailed evidence in support of their proposal; he insisted therefore that the next move lay with His Majesty’s Government, and that, if they did not agree with Saudi claims, it was for them to produce a detailed statement of their criticisms. Hitherto, he asserted, His Majesty’s Government had merely replied to the Saudi proposals by the simple counter-offer of an arbitrarily limited narrow area which failed to take account of the material facts. 5. His Majesty’s Government are reluctant to acquiesce in a continuance of the deadlock reached in the conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza last summer without making any further attempt to reach an agreed settlement. As you yourself have advised, so long as this frontier question remains in its present indefinite state it stands in the way of the general and lasting settlement of Anglo-Saudi differences which His Majesty’s Government are anxious to bring about. Moreover, the rapid development of oil exploitation on the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf renders it very desirable that a definite limit should be drawn between territories which would be recognised as being under the sovereignty of King Abdul Aziz on the one hand, and as being under that of the rulers of Qatar, of the Trucial Coast States and of Muscat on the other. You will recollect that only in September last His Majesty endeavoured to stop the grant of an oil concession by the Sheikh of Qatar to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, on the ground that part of the concession area was included in his territorial claims. If the frontier is not settled there is a risk that similar difficulties may arise from the exploitation of the oil deposits in the Trucial Sheikhdoms if oil concessions should be granted therein. 6. It is clear, therefore, that every effort should be made, especially at the present critical juncture in world affairs, to reach an agreed settlement of the dispute, to put an end to an uncertain and unsatisfactory situation, and to remove a source of friction which has already had an unfortunate effect upon the general course of Anglo-Saudi relations. With this object in view His Majesty’s Government, after obtaining fresh information from the British authorities of the Persian Gulf and of the Aden Protectorate, have reconsidered the whole question, and they are prepared to go to the extreme limit of concession in the endeavour to formulate new proposals to meet the claims of King Abdul Aziz in the greatest possible measure. They have accordingly decided to authorise you to seek a favourable opportunity during the course of your forth coming visit to Riyadh to resume negotiations in the matter, if possible with King Abdul Aziz himself, but otherwise with his Ministers, and to furnish you with the following instructions for your guidance. 7. You will begin by informing King Abdul Aziz that, as a result of the conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza last summer in London, the whole question of the frontiers in South-Eastern Arabia has been fully reconsidered by His Majesty’s Government, after consultation with the local British authorities in Arabia. In particular His Majesty’s Government have re-examined the boundary claimed by King Abdul Aziz as described in the memorandum communicated to you on the 3rd April last, in the light of the detailed evidence supplied by Fuad Bey Hamza, of the arguments advanced by him in the course of discussion, and of the further information collected by the British authorities in the areas concerned. You will then express in general terms the earnest desire of His Majesty’s Government to go as far as possible to meet the wishes of King Abdul Aziz in an amicable settlement of the question, laying stress at the same time3 ritorial would id that tablish nice of Abdul ’ tribal ^the ;ed the ry and , The estiga- iccount etailed t move Saudi icisms. ■ Saudi which nuance ummer Vs you i resent lent of ► bring i shore drawn ^nty of lers of icollect an oil on the claims, e from essions illy at tent of and to t upon w His British udered cession Abdul ied to forth- e with urnish of the lestion &gt;y His ties in xndary licated ied by ussion, l areas &gt;f His Abdul e time on the o g-standing treaty obligations of His Majesty’s Government towards the independent rulers of the Arab States in South-Eastern Arabia, You should emphasise the importance which His Majesty’s Government attach to their historic position m the Persian Gulf, and the impossibility of their agreeing to any solution which might m any way prejudice or impair that position or injuie the interests of the Arab States with whom thev are in special treaty relations. ' 17 8- At this stage you may at your discretion decide to inform King Abdul Aziz that you are in possession of new proposals by His Majesty’s Government. Before describing these proposals you desire, however, to make it clear why His Majesty s Government, after full and sympathetic enquiry into the material facts of the situation, have not felt able to accept the boundary which the King had himself suggested. T ou should then proceed to explain in detail the reasons which prevent His Majesty’s Government from accepting the boundary proposed in the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April last, developing for this purpose the relevant arguments used in discussion with Fuad Bey r Hamza last summer as set out in the records of the meetings. 9. Beginning at the northern end of the proposed Saudi line \ r ou should point out the importance which His Majesty’s Government attach to establishing a frontier in accordance with geographical, as well as political and tribal, considerations. The Qatar peninsula forms a clearly defined and separate geographical unit, and it is only reasonable that the frontier between the Sheikhdom and its neighbours should follow the natural division between the peninsula and the mainland. His Majesty’s Government have already expressed readiness to depart from their strict legal position by recognising King Abdul Aziz's sovereignty as extending over the western shore of the gulf known as the Dohat-as-Salwa and over the Ikhwan settlements at the head of the Gulf; but they could never consent to attribute to Saudi Arabia features, such, for example.^a^the Jebel Naksh, which form an integral part of the physical structure of the/peninsula itself and have always, in fact, been an equally integral part of the Sheikhdom. An additional factor in regard to the frontier of Qatar is the grant by the Sheikh to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, with the full approval of His Majesty’s Government, of an oil concession over the Sheikhdom of Qatar. This concession, which was granted on the ilth May last, while not extending beyond the limits of the State of Qatar as claimed by the Sheikh of Qatar and recognised as his territory by His Majesty’s Government^ does actually extend to the south of the line claimed by King Abdul Azi^r; but the position in this respect will be already known to His Majesty through the communication which I inst^jictpjl Mr. £ajygrt nmkej^y^n}gtele g)um Ao. 112, ¥4u may. tmuklT wcTl.-ttowevev. to reeati-Hus etevclopmcflfr,- and. irr particular, thft.,fa&lt;.i* that His Majesty’s Government have formally assured the Sheikh of Qatar of their protection against any interference with his territorial rights. 10. Turning to the problem of the Khor-al-Odeid (to which Fuad Bey Hamza attached special importance), you will explain to King Abdul Aziz that, as Fuad Bey was informed in London, His Majesty’s Government have long recognised officially the validity of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi’s claim to the whole of this inlet, and have regarded his territory as extending round both the Khor-al- Dhuwaihin and the Khor-ai-Odeid up to a line, running westwards from the northern side of the mouth of the Khor-al-Odeid, which forms the boundary between the territory of Abu Dhabi and that of Qatar. His Majesty’s Govern ment naturally cannot violate or disregard their obligations to these Arab rulers with whom, as the King has recognised by article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, they have long-standing and special treaty relations. Should you consider it wise or desirable to do so, you are authorised to develop frankly to the King a further argument which was used with Fuad Bey Hamza in London; namely, that His Majesty’s Government have had for many years a particularly strong interest in the chain of Ajrab States on the coast between Qatar and Muscat; that the maintenance of this position is an important principle of British policy in the Persian Gulf; and that it would be at complete variance with this policy for them to agree that a powerful State such as Saudi Arabia should acquire $ new outlet to the sea on this section of the coast, to which neither political nor geographical considerations entitle it. [12260] B 2&amp; 11. Pursuing your reply to the claims put forward in the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April, you should explain that a thorough reinvestigation of the situation has now been made by the British authorities in the Persian Gulf in order to ascertain the precise limits of the territory of the Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi in the hinterland of the coastal strip. As a result it has been established that the district known as A1 Aqal, the Sabkhat Matti salt marshes, and the districts shown on the maps as Bainunah, Dhafrah and Qufat-al-Liwa, all of which lie outside the area predominantly covered by the Ahl Murra tribe, are within the historic possessions of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. His Majesty’s Government are accordingly unable to agree to the eastward prolongation of the proposed boundary being carried as near to the sea coast as suggested in the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April, since this would, in their opinion, be incompatible with their obligation to protect the rights of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. Similarly, they can find no justification for the extension of the claims of King Abdul' Aziz as far east as meridian 56°, since this would result in the inclusion in Saudi territory of the steppe country beyond the Great Sands, and of the grazing grounds of tribes owing allegiance either to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi or to the Sultan of Muscat. 12. You will then inform King Abdul Aziz that the tribal position on the southern fringe of the Ruba-al-Khali desert and in the northern part of the Hadhramaut has also been the subject of detailed reinvestigation since the state ment of his boundary claim was received last April. As a result His Majesty s Government are satisfied that the tribes depending on the Aden 1 rotectoi ate and in particular the A1 Saiar, A1 Manahil, Ahl Kathir and Ahl Mahra normally range not only to the edge of the Great Sands between parallels 17° and 19° North, but for some little distance into the sands themselves. You should explain that His Majesty’s Government were informed by Fuad Bey Hamza, during the course of the'conversations in London last summer, that King Abdul Aziz did not claim the allegiance of these tribes, and their enquiries have now definitely shown that the southern and south-eastern limits of the district predominanth frequented by the Ahl Murra (which they understand to form the basis of the Saudi claims in this area) do not extend to the edge of the sands, but lie a considerable distance to the north and north-west of the line claimed m the Saudi memorandum of the 3rd April. 13. You should then proceed formally to put forward the new oiler which His Majesty’s Government, in the light of the foregoing considerations, ha\e now resolved to make, emphasising once more that it is made with every desire to meet the wishes of King Abdul Aziz to the furthest possible extent, but adding in no ambiguous terms that it represents a final concession which His Majesty s Government will not be able to increase. I trust that you will thus dispel as lar as possible any impression in the King’s mind that, m now putting forward proposals much more favourable to him than the two territorial concessions already offered. His Majesty’s Government would be likely to yield still further in response to continued bargaining on his part. As you are aware this is a point to which the India Office attach much importance. You should explain that the new boundary which you are about to offer has been carefully worked out. and that while the geographical, historical and political considerations mentioned in the preceding paragraphs have naturally been taken into tuli consideration the new proposals also take account of the full and detailed intor- mation which His Majesty’s Government have now received from their local authorities in Arabia regarding the wanderings and habitats of the Ahl Murra tribe. In the light of this information His Majesty’s Government are prepared to agree in principle to recognise King Abdul Aziz’s claim to the allegiance oi the Ahl Murra tribe, and they have endeavoured to align their proposed boundary so as to include as far as possible within Saudi Arabia the grazing grounds (“dira”) exclusively or predominantly utilised by the various nomadic sections of this tribe. ^ 14. As you are aware, the Political Agent at Koweit has recently reported that the Murra ‘ c dira ” appears to be bounded on the north, east and south by a line running, from a point south of Hofuf, parallel to but inland from the neck ot the Qatar Peninsula ; continuing in a south-easterly direction along the southern edge of the Sabkhat Matti marsh: turning south-south-east at the south-eastern corner of the Sabkhat Matti; running thence straight across the Eastern Rub-ai Khali as far as the Sabkhat Mijora (approximately at the intersection of meridianv 4 •?' f 1 !? parallel 20° N.); and thence sweeping westwards, within the southern limit ot trie threat bands, so as just to include the important group of wells at Shanna . I enclose herein a copy of a valuable sketch map prepared by Colonel Dickson to illustrate the result of his recent enquiries^ 1 ) 15. You are authorised to make such use as you think best of this infor mation; but you should be careful not to give the impression that His Majesty’s (joveinment ha\e in any way abandoned their objections, as explained to Fuad Bey Hamza in London, to basing the frontier solely on tribal considerations. To do so might only encourage the belief that His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to modify their offer in the light of further statements regarding tribal settlements or diras, and might lead the Saudi Government to embark on a lengthy, and ine\ itably fruitless, argument as to the precise areas covered by tribal migrations. At the same time, you should make the best possible use of the fact that, in their new proposals, His Majesty’s Government are offering to recognise the sovereignty of King Abdul Aziz over practically the whole ££ dira” of the Ahl Murra tribe, even as defined by the information communicated by Fuad Bey Hamza at the time of the conversations in London. 16. After these preliminary observations you should, subject to confirmation by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf of the exact location of key-points A and B mentioned in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) below, and to further tele graphic instructions in regard to the eastern sector of the frontier dealt with in sub-paragraph (c) below, make a formal offer of the following line as the boundarv between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on the one hand and the Sheikhdoms of Qatar and Abu Dhabi (in special relations with His Majesty’s Government), the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, and the Aden Protectorate, on the other :— (a) A line starting from a point, on the eastern shore of the gulf known as the Dohat-as-Salwa, about 4 miles to the north-east of the settlement of Qasr-as-Salwa, running thence in a straight line to a point, which may for convenience of reference be called ££ Key-point A,” which will probably lie at the western extremity of the salt lake known as Sabkhat-al-Amra. (b) From this point the line will run roughly due south to a point to be known as “ Key-point B.” This point, when fixed, will be situated approxi mately on the northern boundary of the Murra ££ diral*’ as drawn in the light of the latest information in the possession of His Majesty’s Government (i.e., on Colonel Dickson’s map (see paragraph 14 above)). It is proposed to fix this key-point B at some well on the southern edge of the district known as A1 Aqal (i.e., a short distance east of the intersection of meridian 51° E. with parallel 24° N.) to which a positive claim can be advanced on behalf of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. The Political Resident is still making enquiries as to the precise points at which these two key-points A and B could reasonably and' properly be fixed, and further instructions will be sent to you as soon as his reports have been received and a decision has been reached by His Majesty’s Government thereon. (c) From key-point B it is proposed that the boundary should proceed, generally speaking, in a straight line, but so as to leave the whole of the Sabkhat Matti to Abu Dhabi to the intersection of parallel 22° N. with meridian 54° (or 55°) E. and thence down that meridian to its intersection with parallel 20° N. The Political Resident is being consulted on the question of substituting meridian 55° E. for meridian 54° E., as originally proposed, for this sector of the line, and tele graphic instructions will be sent to you on this point as soon as possible. (d) Thence the boundary will run in an approximately straight line, but so as to leave the Sabkhat Mijora in Saudi Arabia and the Ramlat Mu^shin in Muscat and Oman, to the intersection of meridian 52° E. and D Darallel 19° N. (namely the south-eastern frxfrermfcy'Of the area— the so called ££ brown line’’ concession-offered to Fuad Bey Hamza in London last July), and thence in a straight line to the intersection of parallel 18°, N. with the “violet line” of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914. lit) ; W It?17. Your detailed comments on the proposed line, which you may make at whatever stage seems to you most appropriate, should be based on the following considerations : You should make what capital you can out of the small further concession which the new line offers at its northern end, in that it lies considerably east of the so-called 11 green line ’ ’ which you were instructed to offer to the Saudi Government last April. You should emphasise that, as a result of their further thorough study of the matter, His Majesty’s Government are now prepared fully to admit the Saudi claim to the wells at Banaiyan, to which Fuad Bey attached such particular importance last summer. You should also lav stress on the fact that the sector of the line defined in sub-paragraph (b) of the preceding paragraph represents a genuine attempt to meet the Saudi claim while respecting the territory of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. You will then do your best to make it clear, while not letting it be thought that the line is drawn on a purely tribal basis, that the line now proposed leaves within Saudi Arabia the whole of the Murra “ dira ’ ’ according to the latest information in the possession of His Majesty’s Government (see paragraph 14 above). Moreover, in carrying the boundary as far east as they are now doing, His Majesty’s Government will be recognising the authority of King Abdul Aziz as extending beyond the “ dira ” of the Murra tribe into the southern part of that of the Manasir, who are a tribe predominantly based on territory under the sovereignty of Abu Dhabi. You may then point out that the southern section of the proposed line, described in sub-paragraph^ (d) of the preceding paragraph, leaves not only the whole of the Murra ‘Mira” in this region within Saudi territory, but also the important wells at Shanna, although these are used by tribes from the Aden Protectorate almost as much as by the Ahl Murra. In conclusion, it will be well for ) r ou to explain that, although the proposed boundary, like that proposed by King Abdul Aziz himself, is in its eastern and southern sections necessarily artificial, and based mainly on geographical co-ordinates, His Majesty’s Government are satisfied that it repiesents a fair and reasonable division between the various suzerainties concerned. 18. Lastly, you should make every endeavour to ensure that in anv settle ment eventually reached all tribes are left free to use their normal wells and grazing grounds on whichever side of the line they may be situated. 19. Basing yourself on the broad lines of the instructions contained in the preceding paragiaphs, I request that you will make every effort to secure the acceptance in principle by King Abdul Aziz of the new boundary proposed bv His Majesty’s Government. In the event of agreement being reached, thev are still inclined to favour the procedure suggested in paragraph 8 of Sir J. Simon’s telegram No. 70 of the 1st May, namely, the incorporation of the new line in a single comprehensive instrument in which the frontier would be defined as beino- between Saudi Arabia on the one hand and Qatar, Abu Dhabi, Muscat and the Aden Protectorate on the other. This point is, however, premature at the present time, as is also the question of the possible final demarcation of the frontier in the vicinity of the Qatar peninsula. I am, &amp;c. SAMUEL HOARE.

As the Saudi Government have been informed His Majesty s Government are prepared, in derogation of their strict legal rights to offer to haudi Arabia important concessions at the northern end of the frontier line, and to admit Saudi sovereignty up to the so-called “ green hne, o which you should repeat tft^ definition. But, as was pointed out to Fuad Bey London last June, this line represents the utmost concession which His Majesty s Government are able to offer in this area compatibly with their obligations to the other rulers concerned. The reasons why His Majesty’s Govern ment are unable to contemplate further concession in this sector'were fully explained to Fuad Bey. \ J 6. The southern limit of the oil concession granted to Anglo-Iranian Oil Company by the Sheikh of Qatar not only does not extend beyond this green line but lies to a considerable distance to the north o\it. The'concession does not therefore extend to any territory under discussion with the Saudi Government. /. Moreover, His Majesty’s Government have formally assured the Sheikh oi Qatar of their protection against any interference with his territorial rights more particularly over the area covered by the concession. In view of the language of I bn Saud s letter to the Sheikh of Qatar, His Majesty’s Government must'make this point clear and draw the Saudi Government’s attention to the terms of article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, by which Ibn Saud undertook, inter alia, to maintain friendly relations with the Sheikh of Qatar, whose special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government he specifically recognises, 8. In these circumstances the frontier question cannot be affected by the grant or exploitation of this concession. For your own information, grant of a concession could not in any case prejudice the legal rights of either party over the territory to which it purports to extend. 9. You should add that His Majesty’s Government appreciate and reciprocate the Saudi Government’s desire to' reach an early agreement on the frontier question, and that they hope that discussions on this subject may be profitably resumed on Sir A. Ryan’s return to Arabia. * \ (Repeated to Government of India. No. 92. and Bushire, No. 57.) oL Telegram Prom To Retec ted xx H.M. 1 a Minister, Jeddf-.

Z* With reference to paragraph 4 of the telegram, regard ing the Saudi claim to Jebel naksh» m the first place the Saudi Government will, of course, have to produce the originals of the correspondence referred to between the Shaikh of &lt;&lt;atar and Ibn Jiluwi. if they are able to do this it remains for the Shaikh not only to acknowledge the fact of its having taken place but also to confirm the interpretatiox^ given to it by the Saudi Government. 3. if the Saudis cannot produce the originals of the correspondence, or if they produce the correspondence and the Shaikh can successfully refute the interpretation put on it by the Saudis, then the matter of the correspondence seems to have no importance. 4. If however the two conditions mentioned in paragraph 2 are fulfilled, the line to be adopted by us will require consideration. jnow that the shaikh has our promise of protection, he would doubtless be Tilling to take the attitude that prior to 1916, when he was not so safeguarded, he had had no option but to yield to force majeure and to concede any thing desired by Ibn Jiluwi on behalf of ibn Saud, that he had never intended to surrender territory to Tnhich he has strong ancestral claims and which is commonly acknowledged as his, ••Colonel Gordon Loch, C.l.Jfi., P°litical Agent, Bahrain. and•* 2 •» and that he certainly now does not regard it as anything else# if he shows any reluctance to adopt this line it could be pointed out to him that he has included this promising oil bearing area in his concession to the Anglo- irai ian oil Company and that if it were now excluded they might well go back on the concession^ or al any rate reduce the payments agreed upon, and that, even if they did not take either oi these likely steps, the result of surrendering Jebel .Naksh to ibn saud would be that royalties which might have gone into his - the iihaikh*s • pocket, would instead fill the King*s# 5* Visavis ibn Saud our additional argument could be that despite his knowledge since several years of our special relations with the Kuler of ifatar, not only did he not take steps to substantiate his alleged claim to this area, but he did not even communicate his claim to us. 6# i shall be glad of your views on the^pointOf ; Confidential , D»0«NotC/8-1•a/38# ?vd January 1936. jlU Sa^rl clslm to Jabel Neksh , Fill you kindly refer to your dend-officlal letter HoJ984-8 dated the 1 3th December 1335 about the Sa *udi claim to J&amp;bal Naksh in Qatar. • I venture to agree with the views expressed in the second and third paragraphs of your letter. It might be worth asking Shaikh •Abdullah about the alleged correspondence on your forthcoming tour. 3. If, however, the matter is pressed, a point of some importance is that on the map (sent with your Printed i^etter ^ No:63-C dated the °6th January 1934) Jabal Naksh is shown inside the limit of the concession granted by the bhaikh to to iuiglo- Ira ian ^il Company, This at least shows that the Shaikh either has never acknowledged Jabal Naksh to pertain to la^di Arabia or does not consider himself bound by anything that may have passed between him and Bin fa f ud on the subject. il x i 1 1 : 4. T should feel inclined not to press too hardly 1 11 at aU) the possibility of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company going back on the concession, for it is possible that in certain circumstances j J the Shaikh might think this to his advantage. I would rather jj impress upon him that, if Bin Ca»ud gets Jabai Naksh, he may give it to an American Oil Company who may, from this point.

I found that sheiich Hafiz had not clearly realised the position about the concession and X explained to him, with the aid of a map produced by Mr. Zada, that the concession was for a limited area which was described on a map attached to the concession, and that although in one place it extended slightly beyond the maximum frontier claimed by King Abdul Aziz, it did not, in fact extend to what we regarded as the frontier between Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The limit of the concession in fact lay well to the North of the maximum line which we had been able to offer to King Abdul Aziz. There was no question of an unlimited 'blanket concession', as in the case of the Saudi concession to the Standard Oil Company of California, and in view of our known views on the frontier question there could be no question of the concession extending over territory the sovereignty over which was in any real doubt. Sheikh Hafiz did not dissent from this explanation and did not pursue the matter further, but the conversation then turned on the question of the south-eastern frontiers of Arabia as a whole. As Sir A. Ryan had by then almost certainly already made his offer to King Abdul Aziz I saw no reason for not giving an outline of it to the Minister, and I accordingly gave him a rough explanation of the line which Sir A. Ryan had been authorised to propose. Sheikh Hafiz rather surprised me by appearing extremely disappointed that we had not been able to offer any further concession to King Ibn Saud in the neighbourhood of Khor el Odeid.X explained to him why this wa8 i^oe.ible. and winded hi, that I had ®ode it abeolutely clear-, both to hinnelf and to fuad Bey, last sunmer, why we could not agree to King Ibn 3aud acquiring a new outlet to the sea between Abu Dhabi and Qatar. I emphasised, however, that the whole of the aurra dire fell within the territory which we were now prepared to recognise as under Saudi sovereignty, and that the line which Sir a. Ryan had been authorised to offer the Kins approximated for a great part of its length very closely to the line claimed by the King himself. I think it la as well that th Saudi Minister and Mr. Zada should hove hod a fairly clear statement of the proposals which Sir a. Ryan will have made to the King, as the accounts which they will get from Arabia may well be slightly misleading. PORElOft OFFICE, 29th Wovember, 1935.■■■mOBBHBHHHr Telegram:- R/S9.

That day, hoveaber $4tiu , after luncheon ?uad Bey expressed a wish to have a general talk about the business side of ay visit. It had already been made pretty clear that the iaudie fully expected official matters to be discussed during my stay and Fuad Bey started our conversation on November 84th. by asking m what X had in view. 1 explained that X had come equipped with instructions on varioui subjects and that, as on previous occasions, I should welcome an opportunity of stating to the King in person th Majesty 1 ® aovemment, although his Majesty waul questions which had been discussed with ?uad Be July. I had new instructions regarding the qu said, was the most important outstanding questi put second the question of -'audi-Kuwait eoononis *^*«v*^ w third that of the prolongation of the validity of t : m Treaty of Jedda, with the tiiree connected questions of Slavery, Arms Traffic and the language of t e Treaty. 1 had Instructions on all these matters. I had instructions on the question of air facilities also but I thought it might be better to leave that until after ay return to Jedda. As for the Trans-Jordan question the position was that we were expecting a reply to the letter which Mr*Rends 1 had written to Fuad Bey on July 19th. 8. This rcoord deals only with the question of the Eastern and South-Eastern frontiers. In our conversation on November 24th., X explained to Fuad Bey the general nature of me to discuss the aetaile with his advisers /toymy new instruction®. I emp&amp;asiaed tft* poeition of Hi® Majesty’s Oorerment in regard to the Arab states on the Persian oulf. Fuad :tey might, x said, dislike the pretensions of a non-Arab state to concern itself rith Arabian affairs but they were founded on an historic evolution. re could not contemplate a break in the line of states with which we were in special relations. 0m th® other hand we were/eeKou^iy desirous of a settlement of the frontier ^eation and the new proposals I had brought took ti e fullest possible account of ths desiderata ehioh the -audi G-ovt-mmsat had put forward. 2 stressed the fact that the new proposals were not merely an advance from the offers, which His Majesty's Government had previously made but were based on a nev/ metnod of approach to the question, that of readiness to meet audi views handsomely when® we could do so, e. r, # in regard to the country of the Murr® tribe, the ajra of which proved in fact to be much more extensive than we had supposed; but we must at the same time safeguard other essential interest®. I pointed out taat in applying this new method we had gone so far that further concession® could not be expected. I also said that they were subject to the assent of the Sultan of 1 uscat, ‘'horn w* had wished to consult but who was out of reach, when the matter had got to this stage. 3. Fuad Bey preserved th® rdle of an attentive listener. He did not demur to ay proposal to give general explanation® to the King in person but was clearly anxious to have our proposals as soon as poaslbls. X thought it politic to promise to let him have on November 25th. a note of our proposals and to show him a map to illustrate their effect. 4. Fuad Bey called on Bovarmber 25th shortly before the time fixed for my audience with the King to present th® insignia of the (KC.B. e had a short general conversation, which I need not record in detail. Its only interest lay in the fact /thattnat Aiad ;ey got on to th« old foalliar theme that Hie Ka^eaty'o Oovernment nerer considered Xhn ;aud aumoiently and had always returned evasive answers to his professions of friendship and a desire for close collaboration with them. ns spoke of the •* ^ • grievances. t riposted as usual by saying how greatly Hie Majesty's oovernment valued the King's friendship but insisting that we had always believed the beet way to consolidate mutual friendship was to clear up outstanding questions. { j &gt;;ill revert to this part of t?i* conversation when reoordii^ separately my conversations regarding the Kuwait B ooked*,) Before we parted 1 gave ?uad Bey my note of His Majesty's oovernment’s now proposals regarding the eastern and south eastern frontiers and lent him a eopy of the latest edition of hunters lin.*= 32 miles Hap of Arabia, showing the line now proposed and that which the Paudi dove raiment had asked for on Aprxl 3rd., so far as it could he draws in from the indications in the laudi meaoranoua of that date in the absence of all the geographical infomation necessary to identify certain of the places named therein. There was no time for discussion but Fuad Bey manifested disappointment at the exclusion of Sufuk from Saudi territory. I told him that that place was much closer to the SabJchat si Matti than ae shown in Hunter's map and was marginal to the Sabkhat. 5* After the formal G.C.B. audience, I remained ith the King to tal business* As he apparently wished the conversation to be private, I aaksd Mr* jppanhalm and Mr. Jusman to withdraw* ^uad Bey re: ained in attendance# S# did Saeykh Tuauf Yasin and the King's four eldest sons but they all at discreetly at the other ena of the room* Captain de Oaury acted as interpreter* 6* I reminded the King of our conversations at Taif in July 1934.

After aiad *7 had left hoadOB, His Majesty's Govern- nt had studied very carefully the information he had supplied and. had collected tafor *tloa other rouroee.

It would be difficult and useless to reproduce the whole of what pass a but the following paragraphs represent adequately the main course of the conversation. 14» Fuad Bey said he had come to infom me of trie Ung 1 ® reaction to our proposal. he aug.eated that altlwngfi it was oased p as X liad aacplairiedg on now principles, their application *aa v ry limited. A regards the Jebel ffalcsh area, he referred to past correspondence between the Sfesyfeh of star and the lUng, through Ibn Jiluwi, in which the ;:h«yfch had asked more as a favou^/t an as a right tlaat the King should no; claim The king had Jeoel XHtlEhaxi and ti» tract known as 4miq* ~^i|r . ~rnnMii Iimmiuu „ a***''** ■ »**»^W-**tt*&amp; t **A agreed and, that being so, the King' would now be disposed to abandon any claim to Araiq, altiougli he, -hiad, had elainjed it in earlier discaseions.

Fuad Bey said that the oo unication to which X referred did not Include our Treaty wi h utar.

I explained that very great difficulties had had to be overcome on the side of Hie Majesty’s Government. Their proposal represented an honest effort to reconcile all the interests involved and I must again commend it earnestly to the acceptance of Xbn Baud. 24.

The fundamental difficulty #aa t at, though he eae the greeteet r ler in Arabia, he was not the only one vno had ancestral claims. ids position was simple* as he had only to assert his own claims.

Usual ending. sd/- G.Loch, Lt.-Colonel, Political Agent, Bahrain. (issued In Arabic overleaf).M On the 13th January 1936 I attempted to proceed to Qatar by aircraft but was twice forced to return owing to faulty oil pressure. The flight was, therefore, postponed till next day pending an examination of the machinery. 2. On the 14th January I left the ground at 09.15 hours (taking with me Khan Sahib Saiyid t Abdul Ra ?zaq and Ferashbashi Muhammad Shahdad) and reached Doha without incident in 45 minutes. On landing I was met by the Agent of the Anglo-Iranian On Company, with his car. 3. The Shaikh had a standing camp at Maqrun, some 20 miles away, and was himself supposed to be a couple of days beyond a point to which motors could go easily, about 30 miles beyond Maqrun. I decided that I had better go go out with the Anglo- Iranian On Company»s agent in his car to the standing camp to get information myself and proceeded there by car. T h e Anglo-Iranian Oil Company*s agent kindly sent lunch to the landing ground and gave me lunch on my return from Maqrun. 4. At Maqrun I found the Shaikh T s cars which had been ordered out two days before with instructions to wait at Maqrun till a messenger came to say that they were to go on the further ?0 miles to fetch him. He was expected back on the 19th or 20th of the Arabic month, i.e., January 14th or 15th, but they said that he might come 'today or tomorrow or after 3 or 4 days' according to the sport. My letter had been sent on about midday by a messenger left by the Shaikh to bring anything from Govern^ ment who knew the Shaikh’s usual hunting places. From their talk and that of others it appeared that here vas no idea of his going to Hasa, and it seems probable arose from that the storyhis going to hawk just when Bin Sa’ud was coming to Hasa. The Anglo-Iranian On C om p any t s agent had hlmself asked on the way out whether *in Sa’ud was now at Hasa and said that people had talked of the possibility of Shaikh ’Abdullah’s going, but that it was just talk.5. In the circumstances as there seemed little chance of finding the Shaikh without undue waste of time, even if transport could have been got, and as the fear of his going to Hasa was entirely ruled out (unless he made a sudden journey there on getting my letter, which seemed most improbable and in any case could not have been stopped), I decided to leave a note at Maqrun telling him that I had come out but that as his date of return was not known and as the Honourable the Political Resident was arriving at Bahrain the next day, I was returning b} the aeroplanes, I asked him to send word by launch, when he would get back, and said that I would come over again then. 6. After a late lunch, I returned by aeroplane to Bahrain without incident. I asked Flight-Lieutenant Macdonald kindly to defer his departure on the 15th January till I could telephone to him after seeing the Honourable the H 0 x itlcal Resident who was to land at 08.00 hours on that day.CONFIDENTIAL.

I have the honour to refer to the Secretary of State it pc for India’s telegram Ho:r47 dated the 10th January 1*L36 in v.hich it was stated that His Majesty’s Government agreed that I should proceed to Qatar and communicate a vanning against committing himself in connection v/ith his frontier to Shaikh ’Abduixah bin Oasim al Than! in case he were to proceed to Hasa to see Bin Sa’ud. P. As explained in my note dated the 14th January 1336 I flew to foha on the 13th January and proceeded thence to Shaikh ’Abdullah’s standing camp at Jfeqrun, some 20 miles south-east of Foha. I did not see Shaikh ’Abdul ah as he was a ay hawking, but I satisfied myself that he was coming back to Doha in the course of the next few days, though his men Scid that they could not tell whether he would come back the next day or during the next three or four days as his movements depended on the hawking. I decided, therefore, to return to Bahrain the same day to meet you and left a message for Shaikh ’Abdul ah asking him to let me know directly he got back. / 3 .

I lunched with him and afterwards had a talk with him and his sons. Shaikh *A!i and Shaikh Hamad. and in this connection His Majesty's Government had, as he knew, been discussing with Bin Sa'ud the question of the boundary betv/een Ba’ud.i Arabia and Qatar. I showed him the boundary line described in the first paragraph of Sir Andrew Byan T s note | November 1955 handed to Fuad Bey Hamza at Riyadh His Majesty's Government had been careful to saf but that they were now disposed to abandon the c although it had been claimed in earlier discussions Csee paragraph they stated that there had been correspondence between him and the late Bin Jiluwi in which he (Shaikh 'Abduliah) had recognised with the question of his boundary, saying that modern conditions, and especially since the discovery of oik, it had become necessary to fix boundaries between Arab States in a way which had been 4. Axfter suitable opening conversation, I explained that I had come to see him by the order of Government in connection unneeded in the ole days when merely tribal grazing was at stakes (country) of Qatar as claimed by him. I said th Sa'udi Arab Government had claimed the district No:14 of Sir Andrew Ryan's report dated the 7th December 1935 on his conversations at Riyadh). X informed him that the Sa'udi Arab Government, however, insistently claimed Jabal Naksh andHim to think well before replying, emphasising the importance of our knoving anything which might have passed in view of the difficulties which would arise if such correspondence was denied and was then produced by the Sn'udi Arab Government. Shaikh 'Abdullah again warmly denied that there had been any such correspondence and went so far as to say that if anything was Froduced it would be £ forgery* I then asked him whether he had had any correspondence into v/hicn it might be possible to read the meaning now claimed b&gt; the Sa^udi Arab government• He thought this over, but replied that he was almost sure that there was nothing of the kind, except tnat possibly (though he could not be certain) Bin Sa^d or Bin Jiluv/i might at some time have written to him asking for permission to collect zakat from individuals of his (Bin Sa'ud^) tribes who might occasionally have been grazing in the vicinity ot Jc.bal fukhan. He emphasised, however, that in such a case trie request would only be for permission to enter an area known to be within the bounds of Qatar. Shaikh T Abdullah then explained that the district known as A1 *Ar&amp;iq was to the south of Jabal Dukhan and Jabal Naksh and between them and Salwa and said that as A1 'Araiq and Jabal fukhan were admittedly his, it would be absurd to claim that Jabal Naksh, situated between them, was not his. He added that Jabal Naksh was part of Jabai Dukhan, 'as the nose is part o p the face', and was for that reason called by the bedouin 'naksh' or 'nose'. The dictionary morning is Hihe lower part of anything'. He further said that he only refrained from claiming /SalwaSaliva as he recogniser 1 that It had passed from him by reason of Bin CaMid^ superior force. 6* Shaikh 1 Abdullah told me that about eighteen months before Bin Sa T ud had sent him a verbal message with a man named IfuhanaBac! bin Nr sir (see the third paragraph of ny Express better No:C/979-1•a / 38 rated the 15th December IS*^) about the boundary of Qatar. He had then replied that his boundary extended to and included A1 Mashajyiyah which ras a few miles from Qasr £&gt;alv/a and that I’lihammad bin Nasir had mcde a note of this in his own hand- writing and had taken it to Bin Sa ! ud. Later Bin Ca f ud had sent him a long telegram through the Amir of Hasa in which he confirmed whet the f-haikh had said to llihamn^id bin Nasir. In a letter the .ate Bin J iluwl had admitted Jabal DuMian a.nd A1 ^Araiq as belong ing to Qatar but had requested Shaikh f Abdullah to allow A1 Mashabiyah to pertain to Sa T uci Arabia. Shaikh T Abdullah says that he replied to Bin Jiluivi that he could not allow A1 Mashabiyah to pass to them as it formed part of Qatar. Shaikh 1 Abdullah drew me a rough sketch (someThat like the attached) which placed A1 f Araiq (which stretched from the Bohat Salwa) to the south and vest of Jabal N&amp;ksh and Mashabiyah south and west again of A1 ’Araiq and between A1 f Arriq and Salwa. 7. I warned Shaikh 1 Abdullah of the danger to his oil should another oil company establish themselves on the ridge of Jrbal Dukhan, and I found that he fully appreciated the danger, and I do not think that he will now do anything (knowingly at any rate) which may weaken his position. 8. I have described my conversation at some length in view of its local importance, but the essential point is that Shaikh 1 Abdullah most positively claims that Jabal Naksh pertains to5 Cftsr and equally positively denies thst the Sa*udi Arab Govern ment have any letter froa him admitting Octal Naksh to belong to Bin Sa'ud. “• 1 In conclusion, I would request that, if there is no 'u! objection, ny thcriks may be conmuiicoted to the Royal Air Force for so kindly co-operating in transporting me to Qatar at short | j notice on these two occasions and especially to Flight-lieutenant G.P.fecdonald who took me on both flights. j I am the more grateful j| as I believe that the political situation in the Mediterranean has rendered the units remaining in 1 Iraq shorthanded and heavily worked I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servoit 1 y -^ieut-Colonel Political Agent, Bahrain.I GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Department.

FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. 27th January 1936. Dear Walton, You will have received under cover of* our official letter No.E 7574/77/91 of 17th January copies in print of oir Andrew Ryan s despatch No.551 of the 10th Decemher last covering a note on his discussions at Riyadh with Ibn Saud and Fuad Bey Hamza on, among other matters, the question or the south and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. 2. In this letter, which I am writing in Rendel's absence on leave, I propose to deal only with certain points raised in Ryan’s despatch, viz:- despatch) that ”as the Anglo-patar Treaty was not concluded 1, until 1916, His Majesty’s Government must respect an ’’alleged earlier agreement by which the Sheikh of jatar ’’recognised Ibn Saud's right to the Jebal Naksh” ai Ryan) by Ibn Saud 'that Sir L.Felly had reached a definite ’’agreement with his grandfather 1 ’. 3. As regards (a) above I think it would be as well if you would consult the Political Authorities in the Persian Gulf and endeavour to ascertain whether any light can be thrown on the alleged correspondence between the Sheikh of Qatar and the late Ibn Jilawi to which Ryan refers in his ^ telegram No.215 of the 8th December last, a copy of which was sent to you under our E 7149/77/91, and furnish us with such material as may be available to refute Fuad Hamza’s assertions on this point. ts raised in Ryan’s despatch, viz:- (a) Fuad Hamza's argument (see paragraph 5 of the (b) the allegation (see paragraph 12 of the note by ’’alton Esq., ttia Office, S. W. 1. C.B. , M.C.,4. As regards (b) it appears quite clear from paragraph llo et seq. of India Office memorandum P.z.5620/ 1934 ’ B 437, that there was no such agreement, and, subject to your observations, we would propose to instruct Ryan to reply categorically to Fuad Hamza to that effect. 5. With regard to the insistence of the Saudis on the inclusion of the Jebel Naksh within the Saudi boundaries, I don't think there can be much doubt that oil is at the bottom of their anxiety and that considerations connected with the protection of Salwa do not really weigh very heavily with them. 6. In paragraphs 26 and 27, Ryan shows that the King attempted to invoke the 1915 Treaty with His Majesty's Government and their recognition of his ancestral claims, but it is quite clear - as Ryan pointed out to him - that these ancestral claims referred only to Nejd, Hasa, Qatif and Jubail and the towns and ports belonging to them, and by no stretch of imagination can these be held to extend to any part of Qatar. 7. The outcome of these discussions between Ryan and the Saudi Government will of course necessitate another meeting of the Middle East (0) Sub-Committee, but I should prefer to await the result of your enquiries under (a) above before suggesting a date for the meeting. I hope however that we may all be ready to hold it some time towards the middle of February. Yours, &amp;c., (Sgd.) J.C. 3TERNDALE BENNETT.m CONFIDENTIAL.
