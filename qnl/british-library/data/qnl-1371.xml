INDIA 01 DICE Qj^dUy, * V/Hlx'EHALL f 3'^v P. Z.#^^/37. 26th May, 1937. Dear Mr. Lewisohn I told you some little time ago that we might want to suggest certain verbal amendments in the common form of the political agreements to be made between His Majesty's Government and the company in respect of any future oil concessions in the Persian Gulf. fou also* I think, said that the Company might want to suggest certain small amendments. have now looked into this matter and enclose &lt; a draft which, as you will see, differs in certain sma^^^ particulars from the text of the Debai political agreement. It has not yet been approved officially here, and I will not do any more about it until you let me know whether you see any objection to these amendments and whether you have any others to add. possible, to get the text settled in time for it to be used in respect of the next oil concession which may be obtained after the Debai concession. But 1 believe it is quite possible that certain of the other prucial Sheikhs will be ready to give your Company concessions directly the Debai concession is agreed, and in exactly the same terms. If this is so it would obviously be undesirable, and there would probably not be time, to alter the Deba. text for these Sheikhs, but the revised text would be It would, of course, be the ideal thing, if available for use as and when it is possible, to introduce it. yours sincerely isohn.

My dear Mendel* Will you kindly reler to Bushire telegram of the 8th June* No,531* of which a copy was sent to you on the 9th June* P.Z.3759/37* about Trucial Oil Negotiations. We have also had a visit from Longrigg on this matter. He says the Company are gravely disturbed about the present situation and feel that they are unlikely to be able to clinch matters with the Sheikh of Shargah and the other Sheikhs unless it is possible for Government to intervene on their behalf. Holmes has apparently thrown in his hand and it is proposed that Longrigg should go out immediately to the Gulf and try to get on with the negotiations. Generally speaking, we are inclined to agree with the proposal which Fowle makes* and to suggest to him that the communication to the Sheikhs should be put somewhat on the following lines. W. Bendel* Esq.* C.M.G.* Foreign Oifice* petroleum/' 2 . Petroleum Concessions Limited are approved by His Majesty’s Government and v/ere first in the field. They have already secured a concession from the Sheikh of Debai on terms satisfactory to his interests and are offering similarly satisfactory terms for other concessions. His Majesty’s Government do not wish to have more than one Company operating on the Trucial coast as this might lead to complications. in these circumstances and on the assumption, of course, that the Resident is satisfied that the terms offered by Petroleum Concessions Limited are fair, His Majesty’s Government are prepared to approve agreements with Petroleum Concessions Limited, but they are not prepared to consider permitting negotiations with any other company. If you agree we would propose to telegraph to the Resident that he may have discretion to communicate as and when necessary with the various Sheikhs on these lines (which are of course very similar to those he suggests). We would also suggest to Longrigg that he should go immediately to the Gulf and keep in touch with Rowle, and, moreover, that he should be prepared to make such3. generous financial offers to the various Sheikhs as would justify powle in regarding the offers as completely satisfactory from the point of view of the Sheikhs. Incidentally we gathered from Longrigg that the company might be prepared somewhat to increase their present offers. YiTe have considered whether we should be discriminating unfairly against the Standard Oil Company if we acted on these lines. Our view is that there would not really by any unfai r discrimination. It is obviously desirable that there should not be more than one Company on the Trucial Coast, and so long as the Sheikhs 1 interests are not sacrificed His Majesty’s Government are entitled to bring pressure to bear upon them to secure that any concessions they may give should all be with the same Company. His Majesty’s Government can also claim that they are responsible for seeing that Petroleum Concessions Limited (who were first in the field) receive a square deal irom the Sheikhs, and to prevent the Sheikhs from using purely delaying tactics with a view to freeing themselves from the obligations to Petroleum concessions Limited implicit in the options which they gave them. 1/4.

I have been carefully considering the question of the relative areas of Dubai and Sharjah and I think it correct to say that the area owned by the Sharjah is greater than that owned by Dubai but that Dubai controls a larger area than Sharjah does and therefore one is liable to conclude that his area is larger than ■Sharjah. 3. I do not consider it desirable for you to visit Ras al Khaimah at present. My information is that the Shaikh is not at present in his state. There is no reason, from my point of view, why you should not visit Umm-al-Qaiwain and Ajman at any time you like. oOoCONFIDENTIAL.

My dear Clauson In continuation of the telegram from Major Holmes dated June 8th, of which I left a copy with you this morning at your office, I send you herewith his further telegram received this afternoon and our reply l Y ther&lt; does not produce additional last minute demands, it seems that the difference between us is now not,serious. The p.no revised offer implied in our telegram of to-day represents an advance, to a certain extent, on the offer which the Shaikh of Dubai accepted and signed, to improve the offer still further, e.g. by additional financial inducement, would appear to us both unjust to the Shaikh of Dubai and dangerous as a precedent for the other Trucial Rulers.

I should be glad of your observations on the points raised by the Company, and in particular on the question whether, in the event of a clear and comprehensive definition of boundaries and authorities in this area being impossible for the present, the Company might be permitted to make its own arrangements with the various tribal leaders in de facto control of the area. 3. It is understood that the Company are anxious to consider their programme of exploration for next cold i weather at an early date and it would be convenient to have your views as soon as possible. The issue of the above has been duly authorised. LfAt'*3842/37 * PC. 28/374. Cit/y-Gate House, Finsbury Square, London, S.C.2. 11th June, 1937. Dear Mr. Walton, As agreed between us yesterday afternoon, the ICth instant, I am sending you a short note containing such information as we have on conditions in the hinterland south and south-east of the Trucial Coast. It would appear from ■ — 1— nr ' l ' this that certain areas which might possibly contain conditions favourable for oil are outside* the effective control of the Trucial Coast rulers, with whom we are already in touch and from whom we hope to obtain concessions. The question which therefore arises - that is, with whom we ought to deal in such cases, and witn whom you a.re willing that we should deal - is one which we cannot long delay facing, and this for two reasons:' firstly, the extent of their effectively controlled hinterland eventually affects the value of concessions which the Trucial shaikhs may grant us: and secondly, our field programme in that area for next cold weather must depend upon the extent to which we can hope for access to the inlying areas. India Office, Whitehall, S .’ • 1. T.S. I am sending a copy of this letter and note to Mr. Rendel of the Foreign Office. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) Stephen H. Gouring. Enel. J.C.- alton, Esq., C.B., .0.,3842/37 . OK COM) IT ICES IK THE HIKTTRLAKD SOUTH AKD SOUTH-EAST OF THE THUCIAL COAST. P.C.L. Geologists v/ho worked on the Trucial Coast, generally based on Dubai, during the cold weather of 1936/37, report that not the least interesting area is Likely to lie immediately to the west of the Oman mountain range, running south-east to north-west and south to north. The area concerned thus includes presumably the inlying portions of the territory under the real or nominal control of the Trucial Coast rulers. The Company is, however, without in formation as to the distance inland covered by the effective authority of these rulers, as well as their boundaries inter se and the extent to which nomadic or shepherd tribes in the interior are to be regarded as their subjects. In respect of the area under particular reference - that is, the crescent west of the Oman ranges - there appear to be other possible claimants to power. These are, firstly , the Sultan of Muscat and Oman himself, doubtful as it may be how far his authority extends westwards of the mountains, secondly, the Imam of Oman (unaerstood to be in some sort of relations with Ibn Baud) whose status appears to be quite independent of the Sultan 01 Muscat: thiral^, the inlying tribes themselves, end in particular the Beni Chittib (who seem to control the Jebel Faiyah area and to owe no real allegiance to the Shaikh of Sharjah, who claims them), the Beni Cha'ab (possibly controlled to some extent by Ras-al- Khaimah), the Ka’dm (who occupy Baraimi and Jebel al Aouha), the Abu Shems (occupying Jebel Hafit and part of the Baraimi Oasis). The Company's position is that it is anxious to send its Geologists to explore this country and, in fact, as much of _——~~ the/r 2 . the Trucial and Oman hinterland as possible. The Company’s Geologists believe that there are no insuperable physical difficulties in the way of such exploration, which they would probably be able to carry out with the help of good guides and perhaps fairly generous presents to the de facto rulers. It is clear, however, that such movements would require nmm mnm the concurrence of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Prom the Company’s point of view the step most desired YvOuld be a comprehensive definition of b oundaries and^ authorities in the area concernedor, failing this, permission to make its own arran R enien ^£_ : ^£ r 1 n rth er exploration.

My dear Brenan, Iiidia Cfxice s \7hitehall,S 6 th July, 1937 /ee / &lt;7 f Would you kindly relej* to the corres ondence resting with our printed letter oi 11th June,?.3.5637/37, regarding the common form of the political agreements with Petroleum Concessions Ltd. in respect of oil concessions in the Persian Gull. ■ffe have now heard from the Resident that the Company have secured a concession from the Sneikh of Sharjah, and it is necessary to take steps for tnc signature of the appropriate political agreement, v-ie shall he writing to you officially asking for your concurrence in the signature of tne agreement t.v an Under Secretary of this Office on behalf of His Majesty's Government, but in the meantime it is necessary to get the precise text agreed with the Company. fou will remember &gt; that a revised draft was sent to the Company on 26th May j (p.2.3492/37 - copy to you on 31st May). You subsequently told me that Beckett was still not quite satisfied that the draft looked right from the lega point of view in certain particulars, and we have been looking further into these points as well as into the points raised by the Company in their letter oi 3rd June (copy to you on 11th June,. As a result we have prepared the enclosed further draft. 7 — '^* 7 ^ '■frenanjHsq. ,O.B.L. in/2 . In Article 3 we dc not quite like the -wording of the Company's suggestion, and we think it will oe simplest merely to provide for the consent of His Majesty's Government or of the Political Resident to he given, leaving us to decide which consent shall he given in wnicn caseo. ,.e have altered the end of Article 6. Its appearance in the form sent to the Company on 20th Mey was the result ox a misunderstanding. The present form, I think, explains itself. The reference to instructions hj the Political Resident refers to the period before general regulations are made hy the Sheikh (at present, of course, there c.re general aircraft regulations on the Trucial Coast). In Article 7 we have introduced the first of the Company's suggested amendments, hut not the second, ..xicn doeo seem to fit, since the sites in question are m no way comparable to harbours (we have, however, inserted a reference to the use of aerodromes or seaplane bases). \!e have omitted Article 11, in accordance with Beckett's suggestion, and will make the necessary adjustment in the exchange of letters. As regards the amendment suggested by the Company in subclause (iv) of the pre-emption clause, we understand that the Admiralty see objection to the suggested addition, and we are proposing to leave the clause as it stands. We have now, I think, covered all Beckett's points except that in regard to Article 10. In regard to this article we recognise that the wording muj not bo ^i'tvx rvf view but on political grounds ideal from the legal point of view, we feel it is important to retain the wording as it stands, particularly/3. 0°7 particularly as it has been already accepted by the Company, who in the exchange of notes agree that in any conflict between the commercial concession and political agreement the latter shall prevail. It is an essential part of this article that the prior permission of the Ruler should be obtained, in order that His Majesty's Government should be safeguarded. We hope that you will see your way not to press your point further in regard to this article. I should be very much obliged if you could let me know by telephone whether you have any more to say on the draft agreement in its present form, so that we can got it finally fixed with the Company. I am sending a copy of this letter to Seal, Gunn and Pirie. Yours sincerely, (Sd.)

DATED 11th July 1937- © Dear Sir Trenchard Fowle, I should have written before this to thank you for the trouble you took with Gordon when I sent him down last month to consult with you regarding future sand supplies from Kuwait. We shall be following up this matter shortly when Gordon visits Kuwait to come to an arrangement on the spot with de Gorey and the Sheikh. Gordon mentioned to me that you were rather concerned about the movements of Haji Williamson in the Trucial Coast States. So far as we are concerned, Haji Williamson’s usefulness is now at an end. You will be aware that our concessional interests on the southern side of the Gulf have now been transferred to Petroleum Concessions Ltd., so that our business in that part of the world is now confined to the distribution and sale of products, mostly in connection with refuelling commercial and military aircraft. For this v/ork we do not require Haji Williamson’s services any longer, and we therefore offered to transfer him to Petroleum Concessions Ltd. if they could find any further use for him. We have now had a reply from Wratislaw at Bahrein who states that his London Office has agreed to his engaging Williamson on terms identical to those which he has been epjoying from us. Before taking any further action in the matter, hov/ever, i should like your confirmation that you have no objection to this transfer* If you would prefer us to do so I can easily arrange to terminate his service with this Company and make no further reference to a transfer elsewhere. Yours sincerely, ^ Col. Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E. Bus hi r e.86/7 Telagram tfroja To Repeated to No. 682 G.T.G. Hesldency Agent, iSharjah. Political Agent, liahrain.

Before talking anything Holmes started criticising bitterly the policy of Political wholesale. He said that the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah was complaining of action taken aginst him on account of Kalba. Holmes who was talking in an offensive manner said that i always get news from him and but did not inform him of my news and for that reason was not straight with him and subsequently in his opinion i was not fit for political work. Holmes did not make himself clear and as he •us offensive l thought best to avoid complications by saying noth ing. Since return from Has al Khairaah Holmes had several inter views with Sharjah’s Secretary. 1 could not think of any ground for this unwarranted remark except his failure at Has al Khaimah. it is highly probable Shatjah’s Secretary poisoned Holmes's mind about exchange of letters with the idea that Holmes might be able to bring pressure on His Majesty's Government.

All our treaties with the Trucial Shaikhs, with three exceptions, are what might be described as Exter nal Treaties. The exceptions are the General Treaty of 1820 No. 19 (page 245 of Aitchison»s Treaties, Engage ments and Sanads 1929) which provided for the suppression of plunder and piracy by land and by sea and the Agreements of 1922 Nos. 34 and 35 (at page 261 of Aitchison*s Treaties,/-- 2 - Treaties, Engagements and Sanads) which provided for the exercising of the right of approval by His Majes ty^ Government before an Oil Concession could be given to a foreigner. Until recent years our only contacts of importance were with the Coast line and we were prin cipally concerned with the maintenance of peace on the High Seas. We were not anxious for commitments in the interior of the States which bordered the Trucial Coast and, therefore, we have even to the present day refrained as nuch as possible from direct or indirect interference in their private affairs. Our treaties with the excep tions noted above were designed to suppress piracy, sup press arms trade, and to suppress the slave trade, and for this purpose they were made with the Rulers who exer cised control on the Sea Coast. We have never endeavour ed to enter into treaty relations with the Chiefs who exercised power in the interior. 3. The advent of Oil mist alter our policy on the Tru cial Coast and in my opinion the time has now come when we will have to penetrate .into the interior and get in touch with the Rulers of Tribes living beyond the areas over which the Trucial Shaikhs exercise control. We are faced with two problems. The first of these is most dif ficult, and that is the demarcation of interstate bounda ries. The second problem is to decide what tribal rulers actually exercise control in the areas which lie east and south-east of the Trucial Shaikhdoms. 4. The necessity for the demarcation of interstate boundaries is brought about by the individual concessions which/-which Petroleum Concessions Limited are obtaining from the Shaikhs on the Trucial Coast* Petroleum Concessions Limited quite naturally are anxious to know exactly for what amount of territory they are buying concessions and at the same time the Trucial Shaikh is anxious,especially in the event of Oil being discovered, to claim as nuch territory as he possibly can* The present boundaries bet— ween the States are not demarcated with any accuracy and I am doubtful if any of the Trucial Shaikhs themselves can accurately describe where their territorial boundaries run* It is probable that the wandering tribes and the persons living on the edge of the States concerned do know roughly where the boundaries lie, but there are large areas which no side has been anxious to claim. Areas in which there is no water, no vegetation and no grazing for flocks and camels. The advent of oil has made these areas potentially as rich as areas where there is water and grazing and now the indi vidual Shaikhs are anxious to claim as nuch land, however barren, as they possibly can. This will give rise to boun dary disputes between the Shaikhs, even along boundaries which are fairly clearly defined, that is, the northern and southern boundaries of the various States. Already a dispute has arisen between the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and the Shaikh of Dubai regarding their nutual frontiers . The tra cing of the northern boundaries and the southern boundaries of the individual States could probably be done without a great deal of difficulty by a Political Officer and the Residency Agent acting in consultation with the representa tives of the Shaikhs on either side of the boundary. This will of course take time but it will be relatively easy work compared with the task of deciding what I may describe as the/-— 4 —- Lk35 (r ^ the eastern boundary of the States for on the east there are no definite controlled areas except in one or two cases such as Umm al Qaiwain and Dubai who do exercise a reason able amount of control over the whole area belonging to them. Some of the Shaikhs have been gradually losing con trol and what was considered an integral part of the Shaikh— dom ten years or more ago has now become separated and under the rule of the Shaikh of one of the nomadic tribes. There is an example in the case of the Shaikhdom of Sharjah a part of the territory of which is now controlled by the Shaikh of the Beni Kitab. This will have to be faced and eventually the boundaries will have to be decided. But with the exception of the northern and southern boundaries I do not think that we can possibly attempt tracing the other boundaries until we have tackled the second problem. 5. The second problem is as I said before to get in touch with aixi decide which tribes and their rulers exer cise control over the areas which lie to the east and south east of the Trucial Shaikhdoms. This having been done there is then the necessity for coming to agreements with them. The territory east and south east of the Trucial Shaikhdoms is an unknown area and I do not think that any Political Officer has penetrated beyond Buraind which lies to the south east of Abu Dhabi since the late Sir Percy Cox went there about the year 1907. I have been endeavouring to obtain information regarding these areas, and I find from cross- examining various tribesmen that the Beni Kitab tsribe (spelt in the enclosure to the India Office Express letter under reference as Beni Chittib) are accredited with exercising/-3 ~5~ exercising considerable control in the area of Jebel Faiyah, ^lich is daimed by Sharjah and northwards as far as the eastern boundaries of Ras al Khaimah and southward as far as Safwan. These enquiries of mine are very superficial and it is probable that a consi derably larger area is claimed by the Beni Kitab them selves • I gather that they are acknowledged as having a certain area which would weald lie roughly between the points I have mentioned and that they exercise consider able control — so much control that the Shaikh of Sharjah for instance would find it difficult to interfere with them. Recently the paramount Shaikh of the Beni Kitab, Mohammad bin Ali, caused the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah considerable anxiety. Going further south we come to the Bur aim! area and it appears to me that Bur aim! is not wholely under the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi as I had pre viously believed. He occupies two or three of the villa ges on the BuraimL plain and he has a representative li ving at the village of Al Ain. This representative, Ib rahim bin Uthman, exercises control in the absence of the Shaikh. The control is only exercised over that part of Buraimi which is confessedly under the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. The major portion of Buraimi, is I believe, in the Ijands of the Naim. The Naim are a tribe which ex tend for some distance to the south, east and north of Buraimi and are ruled by two brothers. Shaikh Sagar bin Sultan and Shaikh Mohammad bin Sultan. I understand that the younger brother Shaikh Sagar bin Sultan exercises control over two-thirds of the tribe as opposed to the one-third under the control of his brother Mohammad. Then again/-- 6 - again we have the Bu Shamis which is an independent tribe living in the Buraimi area and whose chief is Saqar bin Sultan al Hamit who writes himself as Chief of Buraimi. He is said to own an area about the size of the Shaikh- dom of Ajman and he addressed a letter to the Residency- Agent in October of last year to the effect that he »s anxious to come into relations with us and he invited some one to go to his country for the purpose of discus sing an agreement which he wished to negotiate (nothing has been done) • Then going further south-east we come to the area between Buraimi and Ebri. This is said to be under the control partly of the Bu Shands Shaikh and partly of the Duroor tribe and partly under the control of the Ebrien Shaikh 1 Abdullah bin Rashid. It is clear that a considerable amount of touring will have to be done before we can say that we know anything about this part of the world, and the sooner it is undertaken the better. I do not know to what extent the persons and tribes that I have mentioned are said to be under the con trol of the Sultan of Mis cat but I do know that they claim independence. Unfortunately as I have hot got Lorrimer with me — I left the book at Sharjah intending to return there nuch quicker than I have been able to do — I have been unable to refer to this work of reference with regard to the area and tribes I have mentioned* 6 * It seems to me that the sooner we open up conmuni- cation with the tribes of the interior the better and that can best be done by extensive tours by the Political Agent, Bahrain, and the Residency Agent, Sharjah, during the coming cold weather. We mist ascertain before we endeavour to demarcate/--7- demarcate or trace frontiers isho is in actual control of the areas to be traced and to ®hom, if any.one, right ly or iiTrongly the Shaikh in control owes allegiance. Un til we have decided this question - and it can only be decided by personal contact with the individuals concern ed - it is not possible for us to trace frontiers with any likelihood of permanence* 7* I am not in favour of permitting employees of Pet roleum Concessions Limited to become political officers and negotiate agreements with the people they consider to be de facto rulers* They are not experts in work of this sort as I presume Petroleum Concessions Limited employ men for their knowledge of surveying and not for their diplomatic abilities. I think it would be unwise for us to permit the Company to enter into agreements of which we know nothing and with persons with regard to whose status we are uncertain. It would lead to endless trouble and in the event of any unfortunate accident occurring such as the murder of one of the survey party we should find ourselves surrounded by a mass of agree ments with petty Shaikhs and possibly discover that the principal ruler had never been consulted and was bound by no agreement and, therefore, refused to take any pu nitive action. He would most certainly disown agreements between the Company and Chiefs whom he considers to be subordinate to him. 8* It would be advisable for the Conpany to be per suaded to confine the major portion of their activities to the northern part of the Peninsula where the problem is not so great, and leave this cold weather for us to endeavour to make contacts and penetrate into the east and south-eastern portion of the Trucial Coast Shaikhdoms with/-with a view to obtaining a knowledge of the people and the country and coining to any agreements which may seem necessary to facilitate the work of the Company in future years. If the Company consider it essential to continue work in the south-eastern area that is Abu Dhabi and be yond, then I think that as soon as possible I and the Residency Agent at Sharjah should proceed to Buraimi with a view to getting in touch with the people, in particular the leader of the Bu Shamis and the leaders of the Naim. 3. The advent of the Air Liaison Officer who is within the next two or three days to be equipped with a light aircraft should very nuch assist us in our task of obtain ing contact, for he will be just as anxious to obtain con tact with the local people in the interior as the Officers of the Political Department. I think that the Royal Air Force may be interested in flying directly from Abu Dhabi to Miscat and the establishment of a landing ground at Buraimi might be considered favourably by them. Use could be made by the Political Agent of the facilities offered by the presence of the Air Liaison Officer and his aircraft to proceed to such places as Buraimi fairly often during the cold weather and for periods at a time. It would always be possible to send tents by camel transport to Buraimi under the care of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and for the Political Agent, etcetera, to arrive later by air, the camp being struck after his departure. 10 . I regret very much that the information contained in this letter is very sketchy and by no means accurate, but the inaccuracy is due to the fact that I have no local knowledge of the areas concerned and I have not found, so far, any one who has an adequate local knowledge. I propose to/-to continue vay enquiries with the object of obtaining more knowledge of the area in question. 11* I have asked Tomlinson to sign for me as I cannot get the letter faired before leaving for Sharjah* I have the honour to be.

Hickinbotham, I.A., Political A-gent, Bahrain I/Vo No ?62- To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegram No. 629 dated the 26th June 1937. 2. Khan Sahib Haji Yusuf Kanoo called to see me this morning and stated that he was extremely anxious to go to Abu Dhabi. He pointed out that he had served the British Government in an unofficial way for many years and that he had received recognition of his services, such as the Com- panion^of the Indian Empire, Membership of the British Em pire and the Kaiser-i-Hind Medal. He stated that he had always been extremely loyal and given every assistance that il*' had been in his power to give to Government officials. That* as was well-known ; he was no longer a rich man and that he was extremely anxious to be allowed to go to Abu Dhabi in order to assist the Shaikh in his negotiations with the representative^ of Petroleum Concessions Limited. He stated that he was prepared to assist the representative^, of Petro leum Concessions Limited to the utmost in the negotiations and that he had no desire to raise the Shaikh 1 s terms to any fantastic and impossible height. He stated that he expected to be reimbursed by the Company for any service that he might be able to render. This of course would be completely unofficial. 3. Haji Yusuf Kanoo is an agent for the Petroleum Con cessions Limited and I do not think that any harm would be incurred/-- 2 - lb? incurred by allowing him to proceed to Abu Dhabi. There is no doubt that he has acted in the interests of His Majesty*s Government on mere than one occasion and from what I have seen of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and of Haji Yusuf Kanoo I think it possible that Haji Yusuf Kanoo would make a good mediator between the Shaikh and the representative# of Petroleum Concessions Limited. It is probable that Haji Yusuf Kanoo!s presence in Abu Dhabi would cost the Petroleum Concessions Limited a certain amount but from what I have seen of the working of the Company they are not unaccustomed to making pay ments of this kind and at the same time I think that he would be careful to watch the interests of the Shaikh. He is a reasonable man and is in financial difficulties at the present moment and I feel that he would work for a quick and successful ending of the negotiations.

The Shaikh said he was willing to see Major Holmes but that he would have to consult his relatives before making a decision. Major Holmes 1 ill health prevented him from visiting Um al Qawain and so no progress has been made.

He had refused 'to extend the option. The letter which was delivered to him in accordance of July 18th, has upset his plans and he is uncertain of his next move. He was apparently net surprised to receive the letter. He stated that he would write to you regarding the contents of the letter. He will probably announce his intention of dealing with other companies if he is unable to come to terms with Petroleum Concessions Limited.

I explained the letters which are known to us as the 1 trump card! and informed him in what circumstances they have been issued to the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Has al KhaimalNand Umm al Qaiwain. I told Mr. Lermitte that as far as Sharjah was concerned, the next move lay with the Shaikh. That as far as Has al Khaimah was concerned the next move lay with his Com pany who I understood had been given the Shaikh*s terms by Major Holmes. In the case of Umm al Qaiwain the next move appears to lie with the Company as the Shaikh has stated that he is prepared to negotiate at least an Op tion and that in the case of Ajman the next move lay with the Company as no action has so far been taken. I told him that I did not think that there was any particular ur gency about these Sheikhdoms but that I considered that the he should be in possession of allyterms of Concession Agreements so that if an emergency arose he would be in a position to commence negotiations at once. I further informed him that I expected that there would be a reply from the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah with regard to jthe letters known as the ‘trump card, and that I should be interested to see what the Shaikh’s reaction was. Mr. Lermitte stated that he had no facts at all in his possession regarding the terms of the Agreeements for Sharjah , Has al Khaimah, Ajman and Umm al Qaiw^ain and that on ny suggestion he would immediately write to his Company and request them to forward all the necessary documents to him. He stated that presumably there will be no objection to his going to these various places should he have to go to Sharjah to pay out the money fta if the Shaikh agreed to the Political Agreement, and I said that there would be no objection whatsoever - in fact-2- I thought that he would do more good than harm by paying a preliminary visit if it is necessary for him to go to the Trucial Coast but that I thought that fcftEXE it was not necessary for him to make a special trip. With regard to Abu Dhabi I explained at length the course of the negotiations as I understood them from the Shaikh himself and also from Major Holmes. I pointed out that unfortunately Major Holmes 1 views and the Shaikh’s viev/s as to what had takan place were not exactly the same. I suggested to Lermitte that as it was possible the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi was waiting a reply at Abu Dhabi and was therefore delaying his summer move to Buraimi he would be advised to write by air mail to the Shaikh and ask him whether he was anxious to conclude a conces sion immediately, if so that he (Lermitte) would be quite prepared to go at once to negotiate with him but that if he was not anxious to enter into immediate negotiations with him, then the matter might be left until October when the weather would be cooler. Mr. Lermitte stated that he would write to Abu Dhabi and that as he was send - ing him a cheque by the next air mail he would take that opportunity fca of addressing him as I have suggested. Mr. Lermitte stated that he was in entire agreement with the suggestions that I have made to him, and he himself had no particular reason for g&amp;ing to Abu Dhabi at once unless it was quite clear that the Shaikh was prepared to enter into immediate negotiations and was desirous of so doing. Mr. Lermitte informed me that he was surprised at the lack of information that had been given to him by Major Holmes and in fact he knew nothing of the details of any of the negotiations. He said that he was not even sure/sure of the amount of money to be paid for the Sharjah Concession. I again advised him to ask for all details from his Company as he was the sole representative of the Company and it might be necessary for him to act on their behalf alnK)st at a moment^s notice.

Sir, I have the honour to enclose Which had passed between the Ruler of Has al Khaint* and the Ruler of Umm al Oaiwain and the Residency Agent at Sharjah. 2. V»ith regara to the letter addressed to the Residency Agent by the shaikh of Ras al Khaimah, dated the 24th July 1937. I expected that a letter of this type would be re ceived in answer to our communication with regard to the refusal to permit negotiations with oil companies other than j Petroleum Concessions Limited. The Shaikh complains with some justification that negotiations have been very much de layed. However, he is not correct in stating that negotia tions were not opened until after the expiration of the Op tic period, as Blajor Holmes visited him about the middle of July and the period of Option does not expire until the 1st of August 1937. The Shai kh of Ras al Khaimah is not of a very stable disposition and in fact at times is scarcely normal. His A CVlSO r 1 ' ® Qadhl ° f Mejdl origin who at one time endeavoured to form a confederatio n of all the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast. His idea was that in combination under one Ruler they would be more powerful than they are at the moment. Pro bably his real idea was that he would be more powerful as the advisor of the head of the confederation. However his scheme/-• I - 2 ~ scheme came to nothing and he left the neighbourhood of Buraiini / where I believe he resided while trying to form the confederation,and took service with the Shaikh of Ras al Khalmah. mis man has a bad effect on the Shaikh and ills iniluence can be traced in the unfortunate answers that the Shaikh is inclined to give only too often to communications from Political officers. The Qadhi has generally been conducting himself in a proper manner and he has given us no cause to take action of any sort against him, 4, The Trucial Shaikhs are watching events at Ras al Khaimah very keenly. They have most of them at one time or another crossed swords with the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah and have come off second best. They have no love for him and all know him to be a deceitful individual but at the same time I believe they have a respect for his quick-witted ness. Naturally they are watching his encounter*'with Petro leum Concessions Limited with interest and in my opinion the result of Petroleum Concessions Limited*s negotiations at Ras al Khaimah will have an important bearing on the ne gotiations with the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast with whom negotiations have not yet been opened. 5. Both in the interests of His Majesty*s Government, who are desirous of seeing Petroleum Concessions Limited obtain oil concessions on the Trucial Coast,and in the interests of the people of Ras al Khairaah I think that it is time we made the Shaikh understand his position. I suggest that he be informed once again that negotiations with any other company will not be permitted and that should he in disobedience of the orders of His Majesty!s Government open negotiations with any other company then a very serious view of his action will be taken especially in view of the fact that he nas recently been cautioned by His Majesty*s Government with regard to his unwarranted interference in the affairs of the neighbouring State of Kalba. Should theShaikh in disregard of this letter proceed to negotiate with any Company other than Petroleum Concessions Limited then it may be nelo that by his action he has expressed his intention of disregarding his Agreement with His Majes ty's Government of the 22nd February 1922, should it suit hxs purpose, for it mist be presumed that he would not enter into negotiations with any conroany unless it is his inten tion to conclude an agreement with that conpany should their terms be the more acceptable. This expressed intention of disregarding the Treaty or Agreement would in my opinion be sufficient grounds for considering the question of the de position of the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah.

I was thus faced with negligence When the period expired however* Major Holmes, approached me last week and I actually submitted to him my demands which were in conformity with my wishes.

The situation ia difficult and complicated, the gist of it being that tne Company wish now, haying previously explored the coastal area, to sena parties to explore far into the hinterland, where the Trucial Coast Shaikhs, from whom the Company obtained their options or concessions, have doubtless de jure rights, but where the de facto authority is in the hands of various petty tfnaiicns. 3.
