It has evaded British sanction as a result of possessing a 'pass port' from Captain Moorsum, Commander of HMS
                           Ariadne(see ff 9-13). It is noted that the boat in question is currently at Muttra [Maṭraḥ], a small port near Muscat; the nacoda of the boat has attempted to sell it, but failed as a result of its reputation.It is explained that Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl Sa‘īd, the Imam of Muscat, has offered to give up the boat, but that the Resident fears this will negatively impact his standing among the Arab tribes.It states therefore that the boat will be prevented from returning to sea, but that the Resident will take no further actions on the matter, pending the instructions of the Bombay Government.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054665.0x000040#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
