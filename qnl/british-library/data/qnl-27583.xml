We have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with vour predecessor’s telegram, dated the 16th September 1915, regardin'* customs arrangements at Basra. In our telegram, dated 8th September°1915 we proposed inter alia that Mr. C. R. Watkins of the Imperial Customs Service should draw a salary of Rs. 1,050 per mensem to be increased to Rs. 1,100 per mensem in May 1916, when his next increment under the time scale of his Department fell due. 2. It was not possible at the time to foresee that Mr. Watkins’ deputation would be a prolonged one. We have now reconsidered the question of his emoluments and have sanctioned the grant to him, with effect from the 27th May 1917, of the salary which he would have received in India but for his deputation plus the usual Mesopotamian deputation (duty) allowance of Rs. 800 a month. 3.

SlE, We have the honour to refer to Lord Crewe’s Political despatch no. 48, dated the 14th May 1915, and to the later correspondence ending with Mr. Chamberlain’s Political despatch no. 22, dated the 4th May 1917, relating r to the appointment of Mr. Duncan Willey as Assistant Political Officer at Basra, and to his subsequent employment as Second Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; and to submit the question of his future employment and emoluments for your consideration. 2. Mr. Willey was at first employed for a period of one year from the 4th June 1915, his pay being fixed at Rs. 450 plus a duty allowance of Rs. 150 a month, and we subsequently sanctioned his retention up to the 31st December 1917. W'hen this extension was under consideration Sir Percy Cox suggested that his salary should be increased by Rs.' 50 a month from the 4th June 1916, and by a similar amount from the 4th June 1917; but we decided after consideration that he should not be treated more liberally than an officer of corresponding seniority in the Political Department, and declined to consider the question of increasing his pay until he was transferred from Bushire or completed two years’ service, whichever event occurred soonest. 3. The Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, has now reported that from the 7th April 1917 Mr. W T illey was transferred for duty in the civil administration of the occupied territories, and was posted as Assistant 1 olitical Officer to Ali Gharbi, where his responsibilities are considerably increased, while the necessity of offering hospitality to officers passing through is a heavy tax on his present emoluments of Rs. 600 a month. The Civil Commissioner re commends that, with effect from the date of his transfer to Ah Gharbi, Mr. Willey’s duty allowance may be increased to Rs. 300 a month. We support this recommendation.l »• I 2 4 The increase of Mr. Willey’s remuneration would ordinarily be within our powers, but in view of the fact that his allowance was origmaUy fixed at Rs. 160 a month by you, we consider it desirable to obtain your previous sanction.

INDIA OFFICE, 1HITEHALL S.W.I., OoiW^r, 1917. -ft Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 190413/17/44 dated the 13th October, 1917, on the subject of the emoluments of Mr. R. Bullard, while employed in connection with the Civil administration of the occupied districts in Mesopotamia. The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury are unwilling to accept the increased rate of salary proposed for Mr. Bullard by Sir Percy Cox and the government of India, on the ground that his emoluments in his present post were presumably fixed at a suitable rate, having regard to his duties, and they see no reason to take account of the increments which he would have been receiving had he reverted to his substantive post in which his total emoluments at any stage would have been very far below those which he is at present enjoying. 4y .-Beerotary Montagu desires to make a further representationrepresentation in support of the proposal submitted by the Government y &lt;Zrr\ £ MVr^ , , , 1 of India^ that witn Uie exception of the case 01 A33i 3tan u Comissionersof Police employed in the occupied districts, -fe saic;n ie^ of officers employed in connection with the civil administration in Mesopotamia are calculated on a basis permitting them to enjoy any incremental promotion in their own service, which would have accrued to them but for their employment in Mesopotamia (vide the cases cited in the Government of India letter No.1021 of 24th July, 1917 to the Chief Political Officer, Basrah, of which a copy was forwarded to the Foreign Office in India Office letter No. of the 24th September, 1917). To deprive Mr. Bullard of a like privilege would thus be treating him in a less liberal manner than his contemporaries borrowed from the Indian Government service and similarly employed. In their argument that Mr. Bullard is at present enjoying emoluments higher than he would have been receiving had he reverted to his substantive post in the Consular Service, the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury include the special remuneration allowance of Rs.300/- per mensem sanctioned for all civil officers employed in the civil administrationj % Vx APPROVED COUNOIl o 1ST' S4 JJ'iv av c&amp; CoTTf-TV-^ieG mahs no observe no:is 7 - v o : e '‘j 31 OCT 1917 administration of the occupied , d / h r lfon jy\ districts. -Mr, -^ntagu 4s 7 •Q-piii+Q* that this allowance, which is granted as compensation for the nature of the employment in a country where the ordinary amenities of life are wanting, should be regarded as special and be excluded from the calculation.

W. Bullard, C.I.E., of the Levant Consular Service, under the orders of Sir Percy Cox, in connection with the civil administration of the occupied territories in Mesopotamia. 2. Mr. Bullard, as you are aware, was permitted to draw salary at the rate of Rs. 550 a month, together with a remunerative allowance of Rs. 300 a month, with effect from the 1st January 1915. Sir Percy Cox, however now represents that, hut for his employment in Mesopotamia, Mr. Bullard, on the termination of his appointment as acting British consul, Basrah, would have reverted to his permanent appointment of vice-consul on the cadre of the Consular Service, on a pay of £470 rising to £550 a year, and would in that case have been entitled on the 1st January 1917 to a salary of £530 a year (or Rs. 662-8-0 a month). With a view to improving Mr. Bullard’s position, Sir Percy Cox has suggested that he may be permitted to draw pay at the rate of Rs. 650 a month, with effect from the 1st January 1917, together with the remunerative allowance of Rs. 300 a month which he already enjoys.o 3.

In view of the importance of preventing smuggling it is essential that the Collector of Customs should he in a position to detail picked men to he in charge of the posts at Ahul Khasih and Daaiji which for the reasons stated by the Revenue Commissioner are likely to be regarded by the Customs staff as penal settlements unless some tangible concession is allowed to those who are selected for the special work involved. 3.

The post of additional Accountant in the Revenue Commissioner's Office at Basra with a salary of Rs. J. .m. debitable to Basra Revenues' was created by the Army Commander I.l.JVD' in an order dated the 31st July 1915; as after tue capture of Amara it was found necessary to depute to tuat, place the Indian Accountant originally entertained for the Revenue Commissioner's Office at Basra. A locally recruited 'clerk was at first appointed to the new post, but as he proved unequal to the work and the accounts of vary laigc oUi.s ^ere involved, it was decided to appoint a trained Indian den,. Lala Langla Ram, of a Hindu family long settled among Baluch tribes, was the only clerk known to me who combined an intimate acquaintance with Kohamedan habits ana roues of thought with honesty and a thorough training in accounts and who was willing to serve in Iraq. The loan of his services was accordingly obtained from the Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan, a lien being kept on his appointment atV at SiM. Lala kangla Ram entered pensionable service on the 1st December 1913 having previously served for 6 years as clerk for local funds. 3. It was understood at the time that the sanction of the Army Oommander to the appointment would in tue special financial circumstances of Indian Expeditionary force 'D' suffice for accounts purposes. It has now been pointed out that the sanction of the Government of India is required to the increase of Lala Kangla Ram's pay involved by his transfer to the temporary appointment in question. I regret that this sanction was not earlier appliec. &gt; I trust that no objection Five lie It must 'be remembered that the scale oi pay among local employes in Iraq has always been far higher than m India, the most mediocre clerks having enjoyed under the /d Turks salaries of about Rs. 100 per mensem, and clerks with the work and responsibility of Lala Langla Ram having received about Rs. 150 or more. The greater number of clerks employed in the Revenue Commissioner's Office are local clerks who formerly served under the Turks and are still drawing the high Turkish rates of pay. , • ulc ' difficult to introduce among then and over tnem an Indian clerk on a lower rate of pay, for the mere knowledge oi tne fact that his pay was lower than theirs would detract uom his authority and position in their eyes, moreover living at Basrah is expensive, uhe climate is i-rying and tne place remote, for all these reasons the rate of pay given to lala Mangla Ram would seem to be justifie; .

Supply and Transport, of the 1st Peshawar Division on a salary of RsP/5/- p # m. to the post of Indian Accountant to the Assistant Political Officer Suq-esh~8heyukh on Rs. 150/- p.m. debitable to Basra Revenues. B. The post of Indian accountant to the A#P.O. Suc.-esh- SheyuMi on a salary of Rs* 150/- p.m. was created by the Army Commander I.E.P. with retrospective effect from the 1st October 1915 in a Porce Routine Order ho. 133, dated the 28th January 1916, the creation of the post having previously been informally sanctioned. The services of Pazl ‘^adir were unofficially lent to the Revenue Department for the post so sanctioned by the Deputy Director of Supplies and Transports, I.E.P. ?f D i!f on the 19th October 1915, there being no other suitable clerk available with a knowledge of Arabic, which was essential for a place like Sun-esh-oheyukh. In a letter No. s.a./3379, dated the 27th January 1916 from the Assistant Director of Supplies 1st Division the transfer of Pazal nadir to the Revenue Department I. E. P. H D n was formerly approved and a Porce Routine Order, I.E.P. fT D' ,? dated the 19th February 1916 of which a copy is attached was published to sanctionsanction the temporary transfer. J'azl r,adir has held a 11 Q pensionable post in the Sa h T. Department since the year 1908 3. It was at first understood that the sanction of the ^rmy Commander to the creation of the post to which i’azl hadir has been temporarily transferred and the publication of the Force Eoutine Order above quoted y/ould suffice for accounts purposes. It has however, been pointed out that as Fazl Qadir is no. longer drawing his pay from the military Department, but from Basra Revenues, the absence of the sanction of the Government of India to the arrangement might result in a break of service. I trust therefore that the formal sanction of the Government of India to the transfer of the terms stated may now he obtained. In view of the remoteness and unpleasant climate of Suq-esh~Sheyukh the increase of pay given is not, 1 think, excessive, and the same considerations obtain as those set forth in the case of Lala Bagla Ram. in para. 3 of my letter No. 634, dated 14th April 1916.

Finance. Sir P. Cox has represented that he has been for some time overworked and understaffed, and his sphere of work and routine duties at headquarters has so greatly increased as to hamper his mobih'tv his time is much occupied by personal interviews, and he finds considerable’difficulty in keeping correspondence up to date. He lias asked for an officer of sufficient seniority to run his office and to act with authority as his deputy when absent. We strongly support his request in view of the volume and importance of his work. He has at present attached to him at headquarters only Captain Wilson and Mr. Edmonds, neither of whom is of sufficient standing to act as deputy. We fully realise desirability of keeping staff down to minimum, but we are satisfied that local arrangements are not possible and that temporary assistance is imperative. We therefore propose deputation for three months in the first instance of senior officer of Political Department on following terms: (a) lime scale pay. (6) Consolidated remunerative allowance of Rs. 300 per mensem, (c) Travelling allowance on scale admissible to Consuls and Political Agents in the Persian Gulf, (a) Language allowance if admissible under existing rules, (e) Outfit allowance Rs. 500 if transferred from India. If you approve we propose to send Mr, RE lipllgpd for whom Sir P. Cox has particularly asked and who has local an! blher qualifications.

His A ajesty s Government desire that no declaration of permanent annexation ion c )e made, as it would arouse French and Russian suspicions and won d be contrary to principle that occupation of conquered territories by allies is provisional pending final settlement at close of war. Subject to this leniark, 1 approve generally proposals for temporary administration. As regards branches mentioned in Cox’s second telegram, existing structure of administration and local agency should be retained as far as possible and leniency observed m revenue collection. No attempt should be made at present to transform vilayet into an Indian district. As regards superior personnel I approve Dobbs and Scott for present purpose. Administrative control will for time being rest with Indian Government.

Cox telegraphs 27th November. hirst. It seemed to General Officer Commanding and myself that as long as state of war exists or at all events as long as expeditionary force occupies Basra the administration of the town and suburb must be a military one. ^ Consequently Major Brownlow lias been appointed Military Governor with suitable military staff and subject to the approval of higher authoiity concerned. 1 have attached to his Staff, Mr. Bullard, late Consul at Basia, as advise] for civil and local affairs ; and Mr. Gregson, Punjab Police, in oi ganismg local police and registration of arms. Latter can conduct his ordinary Arms Traffic duties at the same time. If these appoint ments are approved I beg that 1 may be allowed, by telegraph, to confirm them and mafie proposals for regulation of pay. If the views of Govern ment as to the stage up to which military administration should continue differ from those expressed above (? 1 beg that) 1 may be informed. Apart from the measures necessary for maintenance of order, measures for conduct oI civil post office and telegraph office, Customs and quarantine have to be arranged for. As regards Post Office the military postal section can only deal with mails of the Force. Suggest that the Director-General may be asked to instruct military postal offices to report as to what staff and accessories are necessary. As regards civil telegraph offices with branch lines appertaining thereto, I am asking for traffic manager, Karachi, who is on board “ Patrick Stewart ” at Mohammerah to come here and draw up report on requirements. Presuming that Indo-European Depart ment will manage the line request that Director-General may then be instructed to arrange for despatch of necessary staff, ft is highly important in commercial interest of community that both posts and telegraphs should resume work as soon as possible. As regards Customs, Messrs. Gray Mackenzie, in addition to agents with whom a military accounts officer has been associated, have consented to conduct Customs for the present, but it woidd be convenient if Customs official could be sent to advise as to future needs. As regards quarantine, Medical officer will arrange in consultation with our quarantine authorities at Mohammerah.” Second telegrams begins :— “ Following departments of Turkish Administration also have to b(N replaced as soon as possible as Military administration cannot properly cope with them. First, management of State property : secondly, management of Waqf properties: third, collection of land revenue generally : fourthly, collection of such revenues as are ear-marked for account of public debt : -fifthly, management of tobacco Regie. In spite of state ol war we are responsible to bond-holders in the last two cases : the sooner management is placed on working footing the better. 1 will endeavour at an early date to state what establishment was employed by Turks in each case and what seems primd facie needed now, probably something similar to that ordinarily employed for'an Indian district. Meanwhile presume Government of India will administer Basra. I recommend that a civilian or political officer of suitable standing and experience, accompanied by one or two trained accountants, be despatched as soon as possible to examine the working of these branches and make recommendations for future conduct of them. It would be well if the officer selected was one likely to lie concerned m the conduct of the civil administration after the war.’ We agree generally with Cox’s recommendations for temporary ad ministration and would 'ask for very early sanction to proceed on these lines We assume that administration will be under Government ol India \\ m interests in the Gulf are intimately involved. We propose to send at once Mr Dobbs, who has special qualifications, to take over departments mentioned in Cox’s second telegram, subject to general control of the General Officer Commanding the force of occupation. 15616.
