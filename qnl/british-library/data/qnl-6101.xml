Subjec t: flights down Persian Gulf by Plying Boats of ho.203 (Plying Boat) Qquadronj 1. Three ,, SouthaInptoJn ,, Plying Boats of the above Squadron have now arrived ai**Basrah and are ready to carry out flights down the Gulf as soon as the necessary arrangements for their reception at various places can be arranged. 2. It is proposed that the first flights to be under taken will be to Bail rain. Mo ings jand fuel are already available there and arrangements have^been made for more fuel to be sent. 3. It is important to establish if possible moorings and a fuel supply at Ras al Khaimah. in order to do this it is proposed, as soon as the arrangements at Bahrain have proved suitable, to fly from Bahrain to Ben jam and carry out a reconnaissance from there to Has al Khaimah. 4. At present there are four mooring buoys with sinker at Henjam one of which is laid. it is proposed to move ^ the other three to Ras al Khaimah. Eventually it is desirable to establish a fuel supply of 3000 gallons aviation mixture and 200 gallons of oil at this place. 1 should be grateful for any advice you can give in this connection. As far as possible the flights will keep to the Arabian Coast in order to avoid any trouble with the Persian authorities. At the same time it would be a good thing if the boats could visit Bushire to give the Commanding Officer, Wing Commander T.E.B. Howe, A.P.C., an aAkortunity of callirg on you, and discussing future plans ifTpou agree. 6• With regard to the general arrangements for the flight we will give you ample warning by cypher signal of our proposals. After you have replied to this we will keep you iniorined en clair of the actual movements.n Persian Gul^f Residency. ^f) 12th. April, 1929.

Sir, i There are a number of matters of detail connected with the work of No.203 (Flying Boat)Squadron in the Pefaian Gulf necessitating correspondence with the Political Agents at Bahrain, Kuwait and Muscat, or with the Residency Agent at Shargah. These are as followsi- (i) Air craft Movement Signalsj (ii) Refuelling arrangements; S iii) Movement and safeguarding of stores; iv) Maintenance of landing grounds; v) Provision and maintenance of moorings or buildings occupied by the Royal Air Force; (vi) Provision of boats; (vii) Engagement, pay and discharge of personnel employed by the Royal Air Force. 2. Hitherto, much of the correspondence connected with these matters has been conducted by Air Headquarters at Hinaidi. Owing to the distance of Air Headquarters from the Gulf and the consequent difficulty in keeping in close touch with the local situation, this system has not proved satisfactory, and it has become necessary to give the Officer Commanding, No.203 (Flying Boat) Squadron greater control over such matters and to give him authority to deal with the Political Agents and Residency Agent in connection therewith. A suitable opportunity to do so now presents itself in the appointment of an officer of the rank of Group Captain to command the Squadron. 3. Air Headquarters would, of course, continue to deal direct with the Political Resident on all matters of policy and on the following subjectsi- (i) Concurfence in flights beyond Bahrain; (ii) Requests for Political Officers to accompany flights; (iii) Requests for any particular political action. Similarly, if flying boats are required for any purpose ..... The Hon. the Political.

DioKson, (U.K., Politioal Agent, Kuwait. To The Officer Commandii^, 84, Squadron, Royal Air Foroe, Shaiba. Dated Kuwait, the May 1934. Flying low of anlties in Ku^vai t territory . I have the honour to draw your attention to a complaint which I received yesterday the 13th May regarding the n low flying' of certain Royal Air Force machines. 2. Apparently four Royal Air Force machines were returning from the south about 9 a.m. on the loth May (probably the Qatar reconnaissance) and when over the village of Abu Halaifa some 25 miles south of Kuwait while two are said to have flown so low (60* was mentioned) as to have stampeded sheep and camels in several places along the road with the result that some were lost and some suffered accident and one woman riding on a camel fell off and was hurt. 3. I have not the slightest doubt that the low flying was not done with the intention of causing panic, but it would be of great assis nnce if officers under your command could be asked to fly at a reasonable height when in Kuwait territory, so as to avoid anything in the nature of panic among live-stock. 4. That the incident was not entirely exaggerated may be shown by the fact five of my own camels who were bringing up my private camp equipment happened to be Sir on the coast, two of them were seen to be flying high that&gt; three miles north of Abu Halaifa village, moving in a northerly direction. They also stampeded and one camel fell and broke a bone in its leg la* down, damaging tent poles and my bath in the process. 5, I trust yoi^ will not think that I am criticising the methods of the Royal Air Force in drawing your attention to the above^inoicient. I quite realize there was no intention to frighten aninals and people. 6. When the machines actually flew over Kuwait Town, I must admit they were ab&gt;ut 4,003 feet up. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant,No. 84 (Bomber) Squadron, Royal Air Force, Shaibah, ^raq. 8th June , 19 54. To:- Lieutenant-Colonel H.R.P. Political Agent, Kuwait. Dickson, C.I.E., Subject:- Plying Low of Wapitis in Kuwait Territory . Sir, I have the honour to reply to your dated 16th May, 1954. I regret that I have not answered this previously, but I have been laid up for over a fort night with malaria. 2. With regard to the complaint of low flying on the 15th May, I regret very sincerely that this happened. I was leading the four aeroplanes mentioned, from Bahrein to Shaibah, and owing to very high contrary winds, I had been flying at a very low altitude over the sea a little way off the coast. When I decided to alter course to fly across to Kuwait town, I immediately climb ed to a safe altitude with the aeroplane next to me. Owing to the glare of the sun on the water, the other two aeroplanes lost sight of me and carried on along the coast for some time expecting to see me, and then turned inland expecting me to have done the same. It was not for some five to ten minutes before they saw me and and climbed up to join me. During this time they were searching for me and probably flew over camels and flocks without notic ing them. 5. I am extremely sorry that this should have happened as it is entirely against the custom of the Squadron, and I should be very grateful if you would express my regret to the villagers who, quite rightly, complained. Perhaps you would be good enough to explain that this was a misunderstanding. 4. I am also extremely sorry that one of your own camels should be one to suffer. Please accept my sincere apologies.

Dear J/. j , Vhen I got up to the aerodrome this morning I found an adverse weather report and decided to abandon my visit to Kuwait this weeKend. I am as yet uncertain as to when I shall be leaving ’Iraq, but the Air Ministry seem to be quite unsuccessful in finding a relief for me. I therefore expect to still be here in septemberand would like very much to come down to Kuwait during that month and go out with you to the jieleing fleet. _£ presume you will go off to India August and will be back some time early in September. It would be a convenience to me if you could let me know the date you intend to go out to the fleet some time in advance. v fU \ i ^ • / &lt;iA&gt; I s jrc r a t.

(a) On 19-4-42 I left Magv/a at 5-30 P*ia. accompanied by Dr. A.L.Greenway, the K.O.C. Headguard, a second guard and a guide. (b) We reached Shadhaf in the Neutral Zone 9 p.m. (c) At 4 a.m. on 20-^42, ^ proceeded to Arq wells (southertiborder of Neutral Zone). There we turned east till the coast Y/as reached(3 hours). We carefully searched whole coastal region round Ain Awaija, Jebel Amuda and Ras Hishaat as far as vicinity of Ras Safaniyeh. (d) Fifteen miles from Ras Safaniyeh vre learned from some Awazim badawin that 3 aircraft had on previous day crashed near the small village of Safaniyeh, situated on south side of the promontory of that name, but that airmen were safe and vrere being looked after by Bin Saud’s guards there. (e) At 11-30 a.m. we arrived at Safaniyeh and found Flight Lieut Bird and two others ( a Polish Sergeant Major Pilot, and an Australian Sergeant Pilot) safe and well though somewhat shaken. Of their 3 aircraft one lay 2+00 yards away, 'and tv/o some 2 miles to the North west. All three had their propellers smashed off with under carriages damaged and one stood on its nose in a salt pan. (f) I told the airmen to collect their personal kit, food, and any equipment or papers of a secret nature and have same stacked near the nearest aircraft, but that nothing belonging properly to the aircraft proper such as wireless, machine guns, ammunition etc should be touched. I explained that I intended taking them back to Kuwait at once, but that their machines and everything pertaining to them would be left behind in charge of the King* s guards, until such times as they received proper orders from the Saudi authorities. (f) I next visited the guards* tent; had coffee with them and explained rry intention to them. This I did after expressing the British Government’s and my own appreciation and thinks for the excellent treatment wiiich they had meted out to the stranded airmen during their 24 hours enforced stay v/ith them. (There was no actual Amir at Safaniyeh but the head guard acted apparently in that capacity). (g) The guards gave nyself and our relief j^rty a good welcome, offered to kill a sheep for us, and explained that they were ready to do anything to help, that they had been more than anxious to assist the marooned airmen the previous day but that all their efforts to make themselves understood had failed dismally. (h) Just before I left for Kuwait, the guards asked me for a letter to put them right v/ith the Amir of Jariyah to whom they had already sent a report by camel man of the landing of the aircraft. (CONTD)Jr^&lt;- This I gave them on a rough piece of paper which they provided. This let was worded more or less as follows, though copy of actual text was not kept. ’ * CERT IF IG ATE « Acting on the orders of the British Political Agent at Kuwait, and with the knowledge and approval of H.M. King Bin Baud’s agent in Kuwait, Abdulla al Nafisi, I proceeded to Safaniyeh to search for three British aircraft, which were reported to have forced landed in Saudi Arabia, as a result of shortage of Benzine and a bad sand storm. That I had found the said 3 aircraft in wrecked condition but their crev/s safe. That the latter had received the utmost kindness and consideration from the King’s guards at Safaniyeh. That I had left the aircraft intact with guns and ammunition in the guards’ care (fi wejh hum), pending orders from H.M. the King as to their disposal,and had taken the airmen back with me to Kuwait. That that ^ was what had to be said and may the Almighty preserve and protect the King . (i) I offered (unostentatiously) Rs.100/- as a small reward to the guards for their excellent conduct, but they refused to accept a penny, saying tnat the King would disapprove of their doing this. I accordingly took their names and promised to ask the Political Agent at Kuwait to strongly reconmend them to Al Nafisi, for a suitable reward. They seemed pleased with this. (j) The rescue party left at 2 p.m. after arranging for the unloading of the aircrafts’ machine guns (all except the machine which was standing on its nosej. (k) We returned by a shorter route to Arq wells, and finally reached Kuwait at about 10-A5 p.m. pausing only to eat a quick lunch at 2-45 p.m., by the way. (l) On the outward journey along the coast south of the Neutral Zone, re encountered veiy bad terrain Indeed, the return journey was better, though bad in parts. (m) The names of the Kin^s guards at Salaniyeh rere Baud bin Jaza (head guard) Shara bin Hanaif. Jaraidi bin Saad. Salim bin Dawas (negro) and I recomnend that His Majesty’s Government’s thanks be conveyed to them through the Saudi authorities through the medium of Al Nafisi.confidential.

Sir I have the honour to enclose a copy of a clear and. concise report prepared at ray request by Lieutenant- colonel H.A.P. Dickson, C.I.E., and copies of letters exchanged between His Majesty King Ibn Saul's agent and myself. 2 * * Blenheim aircraft landed at Kuwait at approximately 1.30 p.m. on the 19th of April and the pilot .vas interviewed by me some fifteen minutes later at the landing ground. He informed me that he had been escorting three Hurricanes to Bahrain but that after passing Has • anura he had found visibility so bad that he was unable to distinguish the land from the sea and had been unable to locate Muharrak Island. He decided that he had no alternative but to retrace his steps to Kuwait and accordingly so instructed the Hurricanes, 'i'he Hurricanes had force landed owing to lack of petrol at Has Mish'ab and as far as he could ascertain one of the pilots was unhurt. 3. I conferred with Mr. L.D. Scott, jf.c., the General manager of the Kuwait Oil Company and lieutenant-colonel Dickson of the same company and decided to send immediately the last named accompanied by Captain A.L. Greenway, If.B.E., .B.u.S., L.H.c.P,, the Agency Assistant Surgson Joy land in cars, very kindly placed at my disposal by the Kuwait Oil Company, to Has Mish'ab to endeavour to locate the aircraft. Colonel2 Colonel Dickson was instructed to search the area of Has Mish’ah and if he was unable to obtain any trace of the airmen to proceed further south. He was informed that I had telegraphed to the Political Agent, Bahrain with a request that the C.A.S.O.C. at Dhahran be asked to send a rescue party north. would apply for authorization for him to fly over Has Mish’ab the following day and verify the location of the aircraft. Dickson’s expedition was successful and the party returned on the evening of the 20th April with the three airmen uninjured and in good spirits. treated the airmen with courtesy and kindness and I suggest that an expression of our thanks be conveyed to His Majesty King Ibn Saud through the proper channels. Begarding the four guards of whose conduct Colonel Dickson thought desirable to make special mention, I do not consider it appropriate that our appreciation should take the form he advocates but recommend that our gratitude should take a more concrete and probably more acceptable form and to this end I suggest that His Majesty King Tbn Saud should be asked to permit us to bestow on each of the three guards Hs. 75 and on the head guard Rs. 100. 5. I wish to place on record the prompt and whole hearted assistance I received from both Mr. L.D. Scott, M.C., and Lieutenant-Colonel H.R.P. Dickson, C.I.E.
