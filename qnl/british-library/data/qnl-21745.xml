PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN. Dated the Reference to previous coxrespondence Description of enclosure :COHFIPSNTIAL, Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain, D.0.No»9Q5-3 * the 14th May, 1947 , Bear Donaldson, I forward herewith a tentative note regarding the designation, status, salutes, etc* of officers in the Gulf* X should be grateful for an early decision on the question of fiags, hut apart froia this if you do not agree with any of my suggest ions you might perhaps leave them for discussion until I come homeoon the assumption that I get my leave* On the other hand if you consider thorn sound you may perhaps think it worth while to pass them on to the Foreign Office for consideration now. Yours sincerely, Sd. w.r.jiay. E.P. Donaldson, Esquire, C*M.G., India Office, LONDON.i UTUaE STATUS Oh' BRITISH 0^ ICiLRS IN Tli^ GUlk\ A. I^KSIGNATICN OF OFFICERS . The following are the designations of the posts at present held by officers of the Indian Political Service in the Gulfj. 1* Political Residents 2. Political Agent (at Bahrain, Kuwaiti Muscat)* 3. Secretary to the Political Resident. 4. Under Secretary to the Political Resident. 5. Political Officer (Trucial Coast). 6. Assistant Political Agent (at present only at Bahrain). At Muscat the Political Agent is also His Britannic Majesty’s Consul and is always referred to as Consul by the Sultan. • These designations have been in use for a long time and I would suggest that there is no necessity to change them. I should have preferred that the Political Officer, Truoial Coast, were termed the Assistant Political Agent but as it TCili almost certainly be necessary to raise the s a us of this officer to that of a Political Agent in the near future I do net think the matter worth pursuing. I ♦ ^ ink “appropriate to designate the Political Agents at Bahrain and Kuwait Consuls as this would tend to lower their position in the eyes of the Shaikhs. They have consider- ■ore executive and administrative powers than are nominally enjoyed by a Consul. I had thought of suggesting the omission of 'Politicel' from the designation “Political 8 Resident but see no real necessity for this change. If any change is to be made in the designation of any of the officers i » decision should be reached on the poin? quirtly T n ° e n ? cee9ar y to use the new designations in the revised Oraers in Council which will have to be enacted at an early oaie. B. PRSCRDENCB . Precedence is Warrant of Precedence. at present governed by the Indian The Political Resident within his charge re.nks senior to a full General und the Political Agents within their charges and the Secretary to the Political Resident rank senior to Lieutenant Colonels. I would suggest that in future the Political Resident should rank as a Minister, the Political Agents and the Secretary Po ( f itic a 1 Resident as Consuls, aid the Political ° - rucia l Coast, Under Secretary and Assistant Political Agents as Vice-Consuls. C. SALUTS S. - “ present the Political Resident enjoys a salute of thirteen guns and the Political Agents of 11 guns. If the proposals »bout the ranking of officers are accepted, the Political Resident would appear to become entitled to a salute of seventeen or fifteen guns according to whether he and r the r poli i ti 0 a| M » niS J er &lt; . J[,ien i P ? tentiary or a * irii 8*er Resident !'L the ^ 0llt i 0al ^ salutes of 7 guns.

B. i'lAGS.. 2 D • y ItAGS • The flag at present flown by the Political Resident and the Political Agents is the Union Viceroy. In future I consider that the Political Resident should fly the Union with the Royal Arms as is prescribed for His Majesty’s Diplomatic Servants, Ministers Plenipotentiary, etc. and the Political Agents the flags prescribed for His Majesty’s Consular Officers. E. POLITICAL RESIDENT’S APPiiLATIOH OF 'HCNOURABLS' . This appellation is prescribed by the Government of India for Members of Council and First-Class Residents. I think I am right in saying that no such appellation is allowed for under Foreign Office rules though I think i t is enjoyed by some high officials in the Colonies. I do not think any harm will be done if the appellation is dropped in the case of the Political Resident but he should continue to be referred to as 'Fakhamat'* 'His Honour' in Arabic correspondence • F. UNIFORM . At present the Political Resident wears Class III diplomatic uniform, the Political Agents Class IV and others Class V. I would suggest that officers of the Indian Political Service who continue to serve in the Gulf and already possess the civil uniforms prescribed should be allowed to continue to wear them. If the Political Resident is given the status of Minister he could be permitted at his discretion to put up the additional gold braid. Of the matters discussed above the only one on which a more or less immediate decision is required is that of flags, as Ido not think the Union Viceroy should continue to be flown after 1st April, 1948, and steps ought to be taken now to obtain the new type of flag which has t o be flown in its place. PERSIAN GUIF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN. the 10th May, 1947.fixt. 1555/47 • India Office, Whitehall, London, S*W«1« 23rd July, 1947• My dear Galloway, A Please refer to Hay's demi-official letter £•0 .Mo .905-3 of 14th May, 1947 about ceremonial matters in the Persian Gulf. I enclose herewith a copy of correspondence with the Foreign Office# So far as decisions require to be taken locally on the matters raised you may proceed in accordance with the conclusions reached in this correspondence* X euppose that formal approval should be secured, in due course, for any changes required in the existing orders* Yours sincerely, Sd.

London, S.W.l. 5th June, 1947* L n My dear Baxter, p The Political Resident has sent heme for consider at ion a note on rririous ceremonial matters Tshich require to be settled as a result of the transfer of the control of the administration from the Government of India to iSxcept for the question of the flags to be flown no immediate decision seems to be required ana you may feel that things can reimin as they are until the foreign Office take ovfer from the India Office in April of next year* You may, however, like to have our views on the points raised in Hay* s note and I set them down for convenience in this le tter. (A) Lesi»r;ation of Officer s We agree with the Political rlecident that there is no necessity to change the designation of any ol the officers which have been in use for a long time and are well understood in the area. The Political Agent at Muscat is already H .M. Consul as Yiell but we see no necessity for a change in the description of the Political Agents at Bahrain and Kuwait. (B) Precedence . It se&lt;d£B only necessary to regulate the comparative precedence between the Political Officers and Officers in His Majesty’s fighting services. As the Political Resident at present ranks senior to all Flag, ‘General and Air Officers, it Beams appropriate that, within his charge, he should continue to enjoy this precedence and that the Political Agents should rank with, but after, Captains, R.H., Colonels and Group Cap tains in the R.A.F. and that the jianior officers should rank with, but after, Lieutenant-Comnanders, Majors and Squadron- laaders• (C) Salut cs I an inclined to think that the best solution is to leave the number of guns as they are at present, and in any • case not to reduce the Salutes accorded to the Political Agents below the 11 guns which they new enjoy. (D) It aeons clearly desirable that the Political Residenl should no longer fly the 'Union viceroy' (which is, I believe, a Union flag with the Star of India in the centre) but should in future fly the Union flag with the Royal Arms in the centre and the Political Agents the Union flag with the Tudor Crown. (£) The Political Res ident's title of 'Hobble ” I expect you will feel that the time has now come to drop this and we should not object if you so decide, but the point about the use of the honorific in Arabic correspondence should be brone in mind; this could perhaps be treated as a local usage and left undisturbed. (F) Uniform The Political Resident’s suggestions seem to be sensible, and we think that, at any rate until new incumbents are appointed the Political Officers should continue to wear the uniform they already possess. C.W.Baxter £sq.,CMG, MC, Yours sincerely, 3d. £#P.DONALD30H .5 ) ^ No.C/277(24/3) Political Agency, Kuwait# November 21, 1949. Dear Sir Kupert, i .iliile you are considering rriy note No. C/276 of November 21 about the Sheish of Kuwait’s guns I should be glad if you would review the position of A 6 posts in the Gulf. You will remember that on my arrival in Bahrain you asiied me to accept past gulf practice in the matter of salutes and calls because you had not had time to sort the matter out since the hand-over. I said that I fully realised the difficulties about salutes because Sheikhs’ salutes were involved and that the question of guns night well be left for a general overhaul but that I considered the question of calls, particularly where the Navy was concerned, should be settled on the basis of personal ran^. The matter was not pursued because you went away immediately and such calls as I paid on the Navy were in the capacity of Acting Political Resident. The present Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, is clearly anxious that I should maxce first calls on him but it seems to me that he has no leg to stand on being junior to me in rantc, age and length of service. Also I find that I was wrong to assume, as I did when in Bahrain, that in the past all Political Agents called on the Senior Naval Officer first for as late as April 16, 1947 a Residency memorandum stated that at Muscat, v/here the Political Agent is also a Consul, Captains of less than three years' standing would H.A.Sir Rupert Hay, x^CIS., CSI., Political nesiuent, Persian Gulf, Bahrainwould maice the first call. Muscat is, of course, an A 7 post. So that while the question of guns might well be left awhile I should be grateful if the question of calls by and on the Senior Naval Officer could be settled now. I am sending a copy of this note to Pelly as the other officer in the Gulf filling an A 6 post. As you will know the Senior Naval Officer invariably makes the first call on the A 6 man in Basra.
