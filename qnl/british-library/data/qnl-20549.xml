E, Although Major Holmea' lateat draft conce^ jn ia open to aerioua objection upon a number of points. My Lorda conaider that the proposal that the Petroleum Department ahould prepare a counterdraft for diaouaaion with the Syndicate in London is tactically moat undesirable. The Ai.glo-Peraian Oil Company ia at laat ta^inf an interest in Kuwait and ia now preparing a draft conoeasion for conaiderution by n.U, Jovernmeat and the iheik , '.xad y Lorda consider that it ia in every way desirable that the Anglo Peralan Oil Company rather than the j^aatern and General Syndicate, who vdll immediately turn it over to the Standard Oil Intereata, ahould secure the concession. 4, If, however, the British Goverument itself preparea a draft concession and the Eastern and General Syndicate v.. accepta it, it will obvioualy be quite impossible thereafter for H # H, Government to raiae any objection to the terms of the concession or to convince the United States ...mbasay that it is open to any possible objection from the iheik'a point of view - in fact the Lastorn and General Syndicate would be virtually aajured of the concea^ion no matter what terms the Anglo-Persian Oil Company might be prepared to offer. The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, 3. 1.— n® 5. If, on the other hand, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company draft is a reasonable one, it will be open to H.M, Government to advise the Sheiic to accept it and to inform iiiastern and General Syndicate that their draft is acceptable neither to H.M. Government nor to the Sheik. If pressed by the U.S.A. Authorities it will evidently be possible to quote a number of points in Major Holmes T latest draft to which exception is taken. 6.

In paragraph 7 of his despatch 1 :0 .21 of the 10th of June, the late Sir Hugh Biscoe suggested that an entirely new draft concession should be prepared for discussion with the Eastern and General Syndicate. His Majesty's Government ere reluctant to adopt this suggestion in view of the information which has been received that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have already prepared a draft concession and have sent it to their locrl representatives for submission to the Sheikh of Kuwait. in these circumstances it would now appear advisable to defer any action until the Sheikh has had an opportunity of comparing the proposals of the Anglo-persian Oil Company with those of the Eastern and General Syndicate, and has given some indication of his wishes in the matter. r.ica.-v/hile steps are being taken to compile a THE HONOURABLE atotor.o + • THE POLITICAL RESIDENT s^aLemenx 1: ti:e PERSIA, gulp.$ ^ 9 , statement containing the observations o- KLs \ % Majesty's Government on the latest draft concession submitted by the Syndicate, a copy of which accompanied Sir Hugh Biscoe's confidential despatch i:o.20 of the 7th of June.

Pages 2 and 3 . Substitute for the passage from ••For this reason' (last line of page 2) to 'formulate their proposals' the following; 'To avoid such a controversy we should have to 'walk very warily indeed. The Americans were 'already suspicious of our every action in this 'matter. They suspected us of 'being able to do 'what we liked with the Sheikh and of merely 'sheltering ourselves 'behind him when it was a 'question of furthering the interests of a British 'Company. They suspected us also of having 'deliberately delayed negotiations with the 'Eastern and General Syndicate in order to give 'the 4nglo-Persian Oil Company time to formulate 'their proposals. The Foreign Office were there fore most anxious that no action should be taken •which would lead the iynericans to believe tntit 'we were actively working against American interests 'The only policy which would, in the opinion of 'the Foreign Office, be justifiable was a policy 'of absolute impartiality as between the two ^competing companies. T &lt;7e must adhere genuinely 'to the principle of a 'fair field and no favour'. in view of theXV '•iwiericaa suspicion.3, it was much to be uoped •♦tJaat tiie offer which tne iinglo-Per sian oil •♦Company were now putting for and would 'be ^demonstrably a 'better offer than the Syndicated. •If, however, there were little to choose 'between ••the two offers, it would be more difficult, but 'at the same time most important, for His esty's ••Government to be in a position to maintain that ••tney had acted with complete impartiality. '• Pa^e 4, line 12. Insert after '•American interests ••into Koweit rt the sentence; ' •Mr. Baxter suggested that the ••necessary safeguards might be communicated to both the ••competing companies. •• page 5 , conclusion (2). \7e snould much prefer not to associate ourselves with the view of the Petroleum Department that our safeguards snould not be communicated to the Syndicate until the general policy of His Majesty 's Government as regards oil has been announced. While not at present desiring to contest the views of the Petroleum Department on this point, v/e feel that if, as it appears, it is tne intention to consult the Dominions Governments ci and to bring them into line before the generl policy of His iw^jesty's Government is announced, tnis may take a long time and it may prove impossible for us to hold up the necessary communications to the indicate until we have agreed with the Dominions Governments on our general policy. Moreover, so far as I remember, all that was agreed on this point was that we should have to have another meeting wnen the ^nglo-Persian Oil Company concession has been received, and when the Petroleum Department have prepared their statement on the Syndicated draft.. I suggest, tnerefore, that tne sentence 'This will not be communicated have been examined' should be redrafted as follows! ^men this statement 'is i^fady, and '•the Anglo-Persian Oil Company 1 s proposals are also available, '•a further meeting will probably be necessary to examine the further action to be taken in tne matter.

With reference to the recent inter-departmental discussions which have taken place in re^rd to the grant of oil concessions in Koweit, I am directed by the Secretary for Mines to enclose for the information of Secretary Sir n hilio Cunliffe-Lister copy of a memorandum ^hich has been prepared in the Petroleum Department comparing the draft concessions submitted by The Eastern and General Syndicate and the Anglo- p ersian Oil Company. I am, etc., (Sgd) Director. r# . . im. V 4 KUWAIT . Memo, by Petroleum Deoartment X y The attached document has been preoared in the 0 Gtroleum Department comparing the more important provisions of the draft concessions submitted to the uheikh by the iiastern and General Syndicate and the Anglo- Persian Oil Company. Particulars hare been added of certain provisions in addition to those covered by the comparison which it is suggested ought to be included in any concession. When the Sheikh has decided which of the applications he would wish to accept it will be necessary to give further consideration to the draft of the successful applicant. There are certain points raised by the Political Resident and the India Office, such as the exclusion of certain areas, facilities for imports, questions of telegraphs, railways, etc., as well as certain drafting amendorents, which can be more conveniently dealt with when the larger question has been disposed of. ^ome of the more important points raised on the draft of the Eastern and Greneral Syndicate by the Oovemment of India in their letter of the 15th April last (F.28o/ri/;38) hare been dealt with in the comments on the terras offered by the two applicants. Two of these are the qu stion of the area of the concession and the period for which the concession should be granted. In view of the ^etroleum Department it is necessary to draw a distinction between a country such as Kuwait, where conditions are very difficult, facilities are few, and there is no guarantee that oil in commcercial quantities willul will be found, and a country like India inhere oil has been preyed and there is a market near at hand to absorb the whole of the production, while in addition there is in existence a Cxovernment organisation riiicfa is responsible for seeing that the policy of the Grovernment in regard t j oil development is carried out. With the existing organisation of the oil industry on the basis of large corporations the tendency is for applicants for concessions to seek large areas for development, and such security of tenure as will enable them to obtain over a period of years a reasonable return on the heavy capital expenditure which oil development entails. 3o long as / there are reasonable arrangements in regard to royalty payments it is in the interest of the State which wns the mineral rights that such a tendency should be encoura ;ed. There is no doubt that much waste has resulted in the past in countries which have allowed undue competition between rival concerns. The Grovernment of India also suggested that the minimum royalty offered by the Eastern and General Syndicate was quite inadequate. Here again it would be very difficult for H. . Government to suggest to the Sheikh that he should stand out for a higher minimum. In a letter of the 6th October 1930 the Political Resident suggested that the minimum of R3.70,000 offered by the Eastern and General Syndicate was too low and that a minimum of Rs.100,000 should be insisted on. This sum has now been offered by the Anglo- p ersian Oil Company. It may be that rather than run the risk of losing the concession both applicants would be prepared to offer rather more than they have done but it would only increase thethe difficulties which already exist in dealing with these two applications if any attenrot were lo be made start them bidding one against the other. The question of the d eclaration that oil has beai found in commercial quantities is obviously an imporiani one. The India Office in their letter to the Colonial Office of the 3rd October have suggested that in place of 1941 the Anglo-Persian Oil Comoany might be pressed to agree to say 1937. There may be room for compromise on this point but 1937 would ocly allow a period of five yoars and the Eastern and General syndicate require that period for exploratory work. 1t is considered that in the first instance this matter should be left to the Sheikh and the Company to which he decides to grant the concession. If the oheikh consults the Political Resident on the point it is suggested that his advice should not go beyond indicating that something rather b tter than 1941 might be asked for. The Petroleum Department has included in the general provisions which should be contained in any concession hich may be granted two which relate respectively to pre-emption during an emergency and re- finicg a proportion of the oil in Ku ait, or British Territory. It is suggested however, that it would be preferable to omit these at this stage from tne memorandum which is submitted to the bheiK'h aiiCi -o deal with these points when putting forward the safeguards required by H.M.

Comment. Exploration and ^rospectia; . 'iVhichever Company is granted the Concession will find it necessary to carry out explanatory work as the geology of the country is much obscured by superficial deposits. The Eastern and General Syndicate refer rather Taguely to 'exploratory work' by geologists and engineers, which they undertake to begin within 9 months oi the date of the Concession, failing which the Sheikh may cancel the Concession. Nothing is said as to drilling and the Syndicate require a period of 5 years for their exploratory work. The Anglo-Persian Oil Comoany ask for a maximum period of two years for exploratory work, which will be reduced if they undertake drilling within that period, to be followed by a maximum period of two years, during whichwhich they undertake to drill at least 4,000 ft. Eeriod of La&amp;s^. As regards t e period of Lease both companies ask for approximately the same terms. In the case of a country such as Kuwait where the existence of oil has not been proved, it is considered desirable that the period ol lease should be a long one. The work of proving and developing an oilfield involves very heavy capital expenditure and companies are not likely to be attracted unless there is a guarantee of their being able to obtain a long period in which they may have an opportunity of securing a return on the money expended. There are precedents for such a period as is now asked for in Iraq, where the period granted by the Itaq Oovemment is 75 years, in Persia where the period is 60 years, and in Bahrein where a similar period is provided for. In his letter of the 25th August, 1932, (36/1932) the Political Resident mentions that he understands that the Sheikh himself asked for a period of 70 years. r J* 16 right to explore 1 Are&amp;x The draft agreement the whole territory of 1 covers the whole of Kuwait /.uwait and select an area » territory for the whole for ultimate development 1 period oi the Concession. not exceeding 1,640 square f miles divided into 6 or 1 more blocks. &gt; » OQaaatn t ■ The Anglo- D ersian Oil Company's draft Concession provides for the grant of the whole of the area of Kuwait, for the period of the concession. On the other hani, the eastern and Greneral Syndicate provide for the selection within 5 years of an area amounting in the aggregate to 1,640 square miles, this area may be divided up into six or mors blocks, and by such an arran jement they presumably hope to secure all promising oil bearing te rritoryterritory which is worth haying. The yalue of their proposal to limit their activities to 1,640 square miles is, therefore, more apparent than real. There would appear to be definite advantages in • avin^ the whole of this rather limited territory developed by one Company of jood standing. Competitive development of an oiltield by two or more Companies seldom produces the best results as it tends to lead to unnecessary loss of gas pressure and premature exhaustion of the field, as has been the case in many fields in the Inited States, The operations of the Anglo-Persian Oil Comapny in Persia are generally accepted as being in accordance with the best modern practice of unit development. It may be mentioned that in the case of Iraq tliere was in the original Concession a provision for the oelection of areas, &lt;,0 much difficulty arose in re ard to this matter that the Iraq Grovernment agreed in the revised Concession grantei last year, to accept the Iraq etroleum Company's proposal for the grant to them 01 exclusive right® over a large area amounting to about 36,000 square miles, or nearly twice the area of Kuwait. Incidentally ihe Eastern and General syndicate re .er to the area to be reserved to them as 'Conceded Territory''. There are obvious objections to the use of such a ^erm and this should be replaced by 'Lease i Area'. forkingels' Ob^at^ona; Th« ) dforklap: Obli^ationa : After oiiceaaion to become void } a maxi urn period of two unless tne Company has , years for exploration, coinmenced exploratory work ) the Company undertake within a period of 9 months) within a period of 2 from the date of the Con- 1 years to drill in a cession* after ) workmanlike manner a commencing operations, ) total depth overall of following the exploratory ) at least 4,000 feet.

This provided for an Exploration period of 2 years and a Prospecting period of 2 years, subject to extensions. In 1927 the Syndicate assigned their rights to American Interests, and they have not yet taken up a Mining Lease. They have recently applied for a further extension of the prospecting period and have only recently begun work on a second well.

Comment,SM @ Comment. It will 'be aeon that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company offer a higher amount on signature of the Concession, and a higher annual amount *hen they commence drilling (which must happen within 2 years of signature of the concession)• Except for the first year after the declaration that oil has been produced in commercial quantities, their minimum royalty is also higher than that offered by the Eastern and General Syndicate• It will also be observed that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company must make a declaration by a date to be specified in 1941,that oil has been found in commercial quantities or surrender the concession* In the Eastern and General Syndicated draft this question has to be settled by arbitration. Bearing in mind the absence of any specific drilling obligations during the period of 5 years provided by the Eastern and General Syndicated draft for the exploration period, it seems unlikely that there would be much prospect of taking the Syndicate to arbitration at an earlier date than that by which the Anglo-Peraian Oil Company must make their declaration. After the declaration that commercial production has been obtained the Syndicate offer a tonnage royalty of 3 Ra. 8 annas per ton and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company a royalty of 2 Ha.10 annaa. To decide which of these is better in the interests of the Sheikh depends on the production which is likely to be secured. And here the amount of the minimum royalty is important. Generally speaking,the Company with the higher minimum royalty will have the greater inducement to produce oil. It may also be said that too high a tonnage royalty may retard production.production, and here the prwrision in the Saatern and General ayndioate's draft, allowing a oeasation of operations should not 'be lost sight of. The rate of royalty offered 'by the Eastern and General Syndicate is the same aa that in India, hut there is a local market to ahsorh all the production. The rate offered 'by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is approximately the same as that levied 'by the Iraq Government. In Venezuela the rate of royalty is understood not to exceed 2/- a ton in most instances, while in Trinidad there are many leases with a royalty of from 1/6 to 2/- &gt; although in recent years a royalty of 3/- has been imposed. In the case of both these countries, over 90 per cent of the oil has to be exported. Customs Duty ; The Company ) Custons Duty. No undertake to pay the ) similar provision.

It la not usual to impose a Customs Duty in addition to royalty. Such a charge might with some justification be levied in a country where the State does not own the mineral rights and desires to secure some financial consideration for the loss of a wasting asset svich as petroleum. But where the State is the owner of the minerals it is regarded as preferable that the State should take the whole of its financial return in the shape of royalty. Apart from the principle involved there is bound to be some difficulty in assessing the value of the oil for purposes of the duty, whether at the well head, or port of shipment. There are some cases in which royaltyjjmtmmmmmmmmmmrnuat (Sf) t^-'l / [ royalty is charged on th« 'basis of a percentage of the value of the oil won, and endless difficulty has arisen in finding a satisfactory method of determining the value. In Trinidad, where the Government owns the greater part of the minerals and the question has 'been thoroughly considered, the idea of an export tax has 'been definitely abandoned as unsuitable• British Control Clause ; Ownership of Concession may 'be transferred or rights sold to another Company, provided that (a) the Company shall be one organised and registered either in Great Britain or Canada with an office in Great Britain at all times in charge of a British subject, (b) of the 5 Directors of the Company, 1 Director shall at all times be a British subject who shall be acceptable to E,M♦Government (c) The Company shall at all times maintain in the region of the Persian Gulf an official called the Chief Local Representative of the Company, whose appointment shall be approved by H•M• Government, (d) as many of the employees of the Company as is consistent with the efficientcarrying on of the undertaking shall be British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh.

While H.M. Government has informed the Eastern and General Syndicate that they are prepared for their part not to insist that any concession granted by the Sheikh must contain a clause confining it to British interests, if the Sheikh for his part is willing to grant a concession without such a clause; it has also made it clear that in respects^l respect of the provision# proposed Ijy the Eastern and Creneral Syndicate which are quoted above and which will enable a transfer to a foreign controlled company to 'be effected, revision will be needed to safeguard the interests of H JJ,Government. A decision as to the exact form of the safeguard has not yet been taken but this will not prevent the aheikh from considering in other respects the relative merits of the two draft concessions. The provision made by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company will prevent any concession which might be granted to that Company passing away from a British company. J - General, 0bservatlou3. The foregoing notes deal with the more important provisions of the draft concessions and will it is thought enable the Sheilch to reach a decision as to which application is likely to be more acceptable to him. Besides the points dealt with there are certain provisions which ought to be included in any concession which may be granted of which the following are the more important. Some of these may be covered in part by the existing drafts 1. During the exploratory period, the work of exploration should be comniencsd within a specified period and carried on continuously under the supervision of a fully qualified petroleum geologist. Correct geological plans and records should be ^ept, which should be open to inspection by the Sheikh or his representatives at all reasonable times.2 « The Company ahould glre an xindertaking at all times during the continuance of the Concesaion to carry on all opera tions for winning and working crude oil and natural gas in a skilful and workmanlike manner and in accordance with modern approved methodsj to maintain all productive 'borings in good repair, working order and condition and to take all practical measures to prevent the injurious access of water to the oil-'bearing formations. 3. The Company should furnish an annual report of their operations, together with a plan showing the location of all wells drilled. They should also keep accurate records of the drilling logs of all wells, showing all casing inserted and any water horizons passed through. 4» All abandoned boreholes should be plugged so as to prevent ingress of water, and excavations fenced off if the Company la required to do so. 5. There should be a provision for the measurement of any oil won, for purposes of ascertainment of royalty. A draft of a suitable clause is appended. 6. It may be desirable to provide for the revision of the rate of royalty at intervals of, say, 10 years, on the application of either party, such revision to be based on the general trend of world prices for petroleum products. Minimum and maximum rate of royalty should be laid down in the first instance. 7. It is usual to provide for a rojfe-lty on any natural gas sold. The equivalent of. 2i (?2 annas) per thousand cubic feet is suggested as a suitable rate.-q © rata. It might also te provided tliat in the event of casing-head gasoline being produced the Sheikh may fix a royalty at a rate not exceeding the equivalent of a gallon. 0. The 3heikh (? or His Majesty^ Government) should retain the right of pre-emption of oil and the right to control coaling and oil stations, docks, wharves, etc., in time of war of emergency. 9. It is considered desirable that provision should be made for refining say 50 per cent of the oil in Kuwait or British territory and that plant should be capable of producing fuel oil suitable for 10# Minerals, other than petroleum and cognate products, should be reserved to the 3heikh, who should retain the right to lea/se them to other parties, provided that the operations of the Company are not thereby obstructed. 11. The Company should undertake to offer no unnecessary or reasonably avoidable obstruction or interruption to the development and working of any minerals (other than petroleum.or cognate products) including water and to afford to the iheikh and to the holders of prospecting licences or mining leases in respect of other minerals reasonable means of access to such minerals for the purpose of working and carrying away the same.- 12. Provision should be made for local office and resident local representative. 13. On the termination of the Concession the Company should undertake to deliver up to the Sheikh without payment of compensation in good order and repair and fit for further working all productive wells or borings together with all casings and fixtures below Admiralty use. ground. iZ» L . j pT^- It 4 !il nar .W : Il fM iSp&gt; 1 mm ■ Is h ■' fili| W :§| : W# ' t 'I ; H 41 i ll-.l 4 : lfl m ®l!.

Dear Magowan, Mr.B.R.Jackson, representative of the Anglo-Persian 0x1 Company in America, who is known to Chalkley.has just teen in to see me about a visit which Sir John Cadman is going to pay to the United States within the near future. During our conversation he mentioned the fact that the Anglo-Persian is having considerable trouble with the Gulf people on account of the oonoeesion which the latter wish to get in Koweit. It appears that the Anglo- Persian were not wij flly enthusiastic over the oil deposits in that district and took practically no steps to gain the favour of the Sheikh, until a British syndicate came along and started to buy the concession from him. As the syndicate could not raise sufficient funds in Oreat Britain, an attempt was made to interest scree American concern and the Gulf people entered into it with saB e enthusiasm. The Anglo-Persian do not at all want to have important American interests in that area and are willing to offer J.H.Magowan E8q. t 0.BeE. t Acting Commercial Counsellor, British Embassy, Washingt on,D•C. thethe Sheikh more than the concession is worth in order tc keep the Gulf Company out, hut H .M.Government are, according to the Anglo-Persian, inclined to favour the Gulf interests in order that it may not he said that we oppose the establishment of an American company on the Persian Gulf. Mr.Wallace of the Gulf Company does not see it that way and has adopted a most hostile attitude contending that H.M.Government and the Anglo-Persian are closing the Open Door and keeping it closed hy a method which the United States Government would never adopt towards British firms in this country (I am afraid his experience in that respect is not very wide hut perhaps he thinks that Columbia and Venezuela are United States territory). Anyway the matter is being taken up as between the American Embassy and Foreign Office and Jackson wondered whether it had also been referred to the British Embassy in Washington because, if not, he was anxious that Chalkley should know that this fight is on. He has tried his best with Wallace and has failed and he hopes to get Sir John Cadman to take it up with Mr .Mellon^ brother in Pittsburgh. It is a bit of a mix-up with the other Mellon as Ambassador in London. I happen to know Major Holmes, who got the concessions fromfrom the Sheikh, very well, and I have always regarded him as an exaggerated optimist somewhat given to extravagant schemes, so I told Jackson that it does not t 1cllow that the oil is worth the expense likely to be incurred; but that does not matter so much and it only makes it all the more tragic if the Americans get into the i * Persian Gull on a wild cat scheme because, once in, they will dcubtless wish to stay and obtain more profitable concessi ons.

My Lords also consider it desirable to add that should an opportunity arise to tender his advice to the Shaikh the Political resident, in addition to explaining any doubtful points in the i-etroleum uepartment's analysis, might well refer also to the following points (i) That as nothing is yet known as to whether the field will be a cheap or an expensive one to work and as at present there is a considerable world over-production of oil, there may well be a strong inducement to limit production from the Kuwait field rather than to increase it. in these circumstances the w bird in the hand- of the Anglo-Persian uil Company's offer seems to be worth considerably more than the •♦two in the bush H of the Kastern and ueneral Syndicate's draft concession. ^il) «•••(iij The wide experience of the Anglo -xtereian uil Company in this area enables then to offer a fair economic royalty, combined with a higher minimum payment«. xhe Kastern and General Syndicate, on the other hand, being almost entirely without local experience, offer a higher royalty and a lower minimum payment but would seem to be themselves doubt ful whether the royalty which they offer is economically possible since their draft conceesion provides fox' a complete cessation of work for any time up to two ye ax 's during which no payments would accrue to the shaikh. 6« i am to suggest that the whole matter should now be considered by the Middle ifiast uificial Sub-Goromittee of the Committee of imperial .Defence. 6.

The Anglo-Persian Oil Company were the first Company to take an active interest in the oil prospects of Koweit, and as long ago as 1917 they carried out a preliminary examination in Koweit and Bahrein and applied formally for the grant of petroleum rights in the territories of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein. For various reasons these negotiations were not brought to a satisfactory conclusion and the Anglo.Persian Oil Company has more than once suggested that if they had received a little more help at that time from the Government Departments concerned the Kasterri luid General Syndicate would never in these territories. The Anglo- have become interest The Under Secretary of State, yoHSiou o jyics, 3. rr.Wm :r ' P0LITICAL A !1B1 MA C IDE Persian(4) l'@) Persian Oil Company ha» represented that at the request of His Majesty's Government they had agreed not to approach the Shaikhs directly, but to negotiate only through the Political Resident in the Persian .ulf# Major Holmes, however, on behalf of the Eastern ahd General Syndicate obtained promises of concessions from the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit by approaching them personally with the result that the Anglo -rersian Oil Company forfeited their chance of obtaining concessions while a lengthy correspondence was taking place between the Government Departments 'concerned, the Govericneiit of India, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the High Commissioner for Iraq. (2) In 1925, Major Holmes, acting on behalf of the Eastern and General Syndicate (which v/as then purely a British Company) made certain proposals to the Sheikh In regard to the grant of a concession which were not, however, acceptable to him* The Anglo Persian Oil Company also continued to negotiate without success• (3) In Harch, 1926, the Eastern and General Syndicate commenced operationa (lay arrangement with the Sheikh) to drill for water In Koweit, and undertook to sink two wells within the a»a surrounded by the town wall of Koweit* After several failures the first well reached a depth of 700 feet without striking water. It was apparently as the result of information disclosed by these water boring operations that the interest oi the Syndicate in the oil prospects of Koweit was further stimulated. (It should be noted that these operations had nothing ostensibly to do with prospecting for oil, the Sheikh having refused to grant to ajor . ol an oil prospecting licence#)(4) In September, 1928 t however. Major Holmes, with the permission of the Political Resident, a/^in approached the Sheikh for the grant of an oil concession, and submitted a draft agreement. (5) In November, 1928, it was realised that the point concerning a British Control Clause had been overlooked in the Bahrein Concession, and the Eastern and General Syndicate were infomed that in any concession in Koweit which misjit be granted, a British Control Clause must be inserted similar to that imposed in the case of British Companies operating in British Grown Colonies. No question of American participation had, up to this time, arisen and the suggested inclusion of the nationality clause was in fact put forward partly as a precautionary mmsuve in order to bring the concession into line with British practice in other oil producing territories (such as India and Trinidad) and partly because the Sheikh of Koweit expressed himself as being unwilling to grant a concession to any Company which was not under British control. It was not until December 19th, 1928, that the Syndicate informed the Colonial Office that they had concluded a^eements with the Eastern Gulf Oil Company, under which tney assi^ied to that Company such rights as they possessed to explore the territories which they were interested in, with options to form Companies under British or Canadian Laws to acquire and work any territories taken up under the terms of their options. (6) In March, 1929, the Political Resident reported that Major Holmes had arrived in Koweit and left for Baghdad, but that apparently he had not renewed with the Sheikh the negotiations for an oil concession. (7) In August 1930, the Eastern and General Syndicate drew up a Second draft concession which they forwarded to the ColonialColonial Office asking that it might be discuesed with the Directors of the Syndicate and Major Holmes in London. The Colonial Office replied that before the matter of the concession could be discussed it would be necessary to consult the other interested Crovemment Departments, and also the Political Resident in the Persian Grulf. In the meantime Major Holmes had written to the Political Agent at Koweit stating that the proposed British Control Clause was causing much difficulty with the Company's American Associates, and that it was their intention to take up the question of modifying it with a view to making it conform with the modified form of British Control Clause which had The Sheikh of Koweit on the other hand is understood to have informed the Political Resident that under no circumstances would he agree to a concession being transferred to an American Company, and to have been insistent that the nationality clause should be inserted and the concessionaires remain British. This attitude of the Sheikh accorded with the policy of the Government of India, who were entirely opposed to the entry of United States f interests into the area of the Persian Gulf. (8) In August, 1931, the Anglo Persian Oil Company, largely on account of representations made to t era by the Petroleum Deoartn'ent, renewed their application in regard to Koweit and announced tiaeir readiness to make a further geological exa'riination, which was subsequently carried out. representations were wade by the United States Government. Some of these ooints were set out in the Foreign Office Mote of April 9th, 1931, (S. 1733 /121/91) which was sent to the United States ^rovernment. It will be seen from the above summary that while it may be true tnat for some 4 years the Eastern and General Syndicate have been endeavouring to obtain a concession in Koweit/ by that time been incorporated in the Bahrein Agreement. (9) It wai not untilKoweit, British intersata ha'e been negotiating - r very much longer, and without any greater aucceaa. At a Conference held at the Colonial Offi '9 on the let January, 1932, the representative of the Forei-n Cn . i e agreed that provided the Anglo Peraian Oil Company were serious in their intentions aa regards oweit it would e as well to keep the position open for the present as f'r as the United States was concerned. As regards the complaint of delay in completi ^ jhe comparison of the two draft concessions referred to in your letter, the Secretary for Mines deairea to point ou. at it ie not the caae that no progress has been made in the matter. A critical examination of the Eastern and General Syndicate's draft had already been ore pared in the .ebroleu Depart'.ent when the Anglo Persian Oil Company's draft concession was received. It was however agreed at a uepartmental Conference that it would be advisable to defer sending this until a comprehensive statement could be drawn up, comparing the relative merits of the two drafts. In point of -act, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's draft was not received in the Petroleum Department until September 14th, at a tine when, as it happened, the staff of the Department was depleted by illness, and many other more urgent questions had to be dealt with. It cannot be accepted, moreover, that the delay of 4 years, to which Mr.Mellon refers, can be attributed to the Petroleum Department, and it would be futile to suggest that a delay of a few weeks in co oaring the ten s of the draft concessions has in any way prejudiced the Eastern and General Syndicate or the Anglo Persian Oil Company. The points involved in considering the araft concessions raise technical questions of some difficulty, but the Secretary for lines hopes to be in a position to submit/submit, a statement comparing the two dm ft concessions within the next few days. A cony of this letter is beinr; sent to the Colonial Office, India Office and Admiralty. I am, etc., (Sgd.) F. C. STARLING Directoi%PfREIOK OPPICE, 8.V. 1. 83rd Noveater, 1988. My doar AmT&gt;#s68&lt;lcP, Slnc« I wrote to you on November 11th about K v.elt oil, I have been oensiaering the question, on which, ib y&gt; u know, x was not in poseesalcn of ftxll details at the time of cur Interriew. I have, therefore, ooae to It with « fresh mind, and one or two points have at onoe struck me. y' u * Crfl : ^ 2o The niemQrand « ffl which ycu left with me on November 2nd might be Interpreted as Implying that Hia Majesty's Government have been purposely procrastinating In regard to the participation of American interests in the development of Koweit oil for ever four years. But. apart from the fact that the Anglo-Persian oil Company ^ere in the field in Koweit long before the British concern which is now acting for the United States interests. I wish re make it clear that the decieicn of His Majesty 's Ocvemment (which was communicated to the Eastern and His Excellency General JPhe HcncuraMe Andrew v. Mellon,r y (S) General Syndicate in November 1923) that any oil concession which might 'be granted must contain a clause which would confine it to British interest Sp wa- ttiken on grounds of general policy and before we hao. heai anything of American participation in the matter. The decision was in fact taken in pursuance of the then existing goaopal policy of His Majesty's Government which had 'been in force for many years, and aleo 'beonuee the Sheikh of Koweit, whose interests they are, of course, under an obligation to protect, expressed himself as unwilling to grant a concession to any company not under British control« It was not until December 19, 1986, that the Syndicate informed the colonial Office of their agreement with the Eastern Gulf Oil company, by which the conces6ion ? if obtained, was to be transferred to United States interests^ His Majesty^s Government did not however feel able to change their decision until, in December 1931, your Embassy first made representations In the matter. Then His Majesty's Government, in their desire to go as far as they could to meet the United StatesStates Ocvernment, reconsidered the Question and decided after much deliberation that, while they could not ccmmlt the Sheikh of Kcwett# they would, for their part, not insist in this case that any concession granted must contain a clause confining it to British intereate, if the Sheikh for his part waa willing to grant a concession without such a clause, and we so informed your Embeesy in April. 3 o Ycur memorandum alac rere he representa tions made in Athertcn's official note No. 831 of the 6th September, to the effect that the American interests concerned are labouring under a diaa^nKitage as compared with the Anglo -Persian Oil Company o^rtjLg to their ignorance of the provisos which His Majesty's Government would require to see embodied in the concessions granted, in order to safeguard their own interests. But surely these representa tions were satisfactorily answered in 8ir John Simon 's reply? No. S 4588/121/91 cf the 16th Beptem^ero As I understand it, the ^safeguards w are a matter for discussion after the Sheikh of Kow^it has made his decision from the print of view of what is to til® T *aat advantage cf hishis cwn State* (I am advised that though no final decision has teen taken cn the point it ts not unlikely that at ieaet soma of them would actually have to 'be embodied in ^ny conceseion which might be granted to a purely Britiah Oil Company wishing itself to operate in Koweit). As these s&amp;fegu&amp;rds are not primarily the concern of the Sheikh, and will not affect the comparison of the two draft concessions on their merits, they do not in our view effect the matter at the present stage^ 4a As you know, that stage is that the latest draft concession submitted 'by the Eastern and General Syndicate and the draft submitted by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have Teen compared in London by the department concerned on the technical side in order that the Sheikh, who is naturally not well versed In such technical matters, may understand *hat in fact will be the effect of the main provisions of each offer (e^g^ the financial side, conditions of working the oil, etc®, etc*,). The resulting document is now on its way to the Persian Gulf and wa must await the result of the Sheikhas examinations 5o The two offers made for tha concesaion are thusthus 'being treated concurren'tly^ «nC thatj I you will appreciate, waa the ctt!Ly correct course for His Majesty's Government to take in order to secure the moat acceptable terms for the Sheikh, If only in hie interest. His Majesty's Government were naturally 'bound, ee Sir J.hr. Simon Informed At her ton in his note NO b E 1733/121/91 of * the 9th April, to allow any interested company to consider whether they wanted to apply for a concession, and if so to give them time to do so* The Anglo-Persial Oil Company formally renewed their efforts to obtain a concession in Koweit in August, 1931 (not October as mentioned in your memorandum) c 6, X regret that there has been delay in the whole matter; I cannot of course at this stage say exactly when the Sheikh will decide to grant a concession; I do hope, however, that In the light of the preliminary information I have now given, you will be a^lc to assure your Government that there has been no desire on our part to cause them embarrassment by any avoidable delay. Believe me, My dear Ambassador, Yours sincerely,811 Ill I ■ II ¥ t1 -a- The matters dealt with in the deleted paragraphs will be taken up at a later stage* Also last sentence of all, commenoing * when Shaikh has made his choice' should be deleted, this being a matter for you to arrange with Shaikh and you should take a suitable opportunity of bringing suggestion in that sentence to his notice. As you are aware 9 it is Tery desirable from point of view of His Majesty's Goyernment to reach a definite decision as soon as possible in view of pressure now being brought to bear by American oil interests and it is hoped that you and Political Agent, Kuwait, will now be able to persuade Shaikh to reach a decision between the rival applicants in the light of information contained in memo randum which will be communicated to him as above* You will appreciate that it is most important in case Shaikh decides in favour of Anglo-Persian Oil Company that His Majesty's Government should be able to avoid any suggestion that pressure has been brought to be? r on him, or that decision is not the Shaikh's own* In the circumstances, while you and Political Agent are at liberty to give Shaikh any explanations for which he may ask, either of the statements in memorandum or of effects in the light of that draft concession, you should leave it entirely to him to make the choice on his sole responsibility* - Secretary of State for the Colonies • Br^QfUS^R. for Secret■ lie ii R 1 ■ i/i- m. -I - ^ 'LiS I jskp I &lt;2 &amp; ll 4 ^W9 Telegram Pr om JP.

There is little doubt in my mind that Major Holmes was made aware by his principals, the Eastern and General Syndicate, Ltd., London, that His Majesty's Governments comments on the A.P.O.C, Draft Concession and that of the Eastern and General Syndicate were on their way out to Kuwait, hence his letter of 21st December 1932 (copy forwarded to you under my confidential No.213 dated 22nd December 1932). 2* Major Holmes consequently decided to make a last bid for the Shaikh's favour by persuading him to go to Bahrain and offer his condolences to Shaikh Hamad on the death of his father the late Shaikh Sir Isa bin Ali al Khalifa. The Shaikh had already it may be recollected cancelled his intended visit to Bahrain fixed for the 15th December, but altered it again on the arrival of Major Holmes from that place. The latter on the plea that Shaikh Hamad of Bahrain was very upset at the prospect of not seeing the Shaikh of Kuwait, managed to persuade the Shaikh of Kuwait to alter his plans and visit Bahrain on 22nd December. 3* Having succeeded in his plan. Major Holmes proceeded to take charge of the Shaikh, as if he were his The Hon'ble Lt-Col.

He paid for all air tickets both ways for the Shaikh and his entourage, and met all the Shaikh's expenses during his sojourn in Bahrain# Over and above every thing, he went so far as to insist on his staying in his own house in Bahrain, and arranged most of his goings and comings whilst in the island# All this the ohaikh told me on his return, saying that Major Holmes on their arrival refused to allow Shaikh Hamad to take him (the Shaikh) away to his own palace, and that Shaikh Hamad did not seem to mind at all# The plot seems to have nicely arranged between Shaikh Hamad and Major Holmes with the Shaikh as a willing victim# Certain it is that the Shaikh is profoundly grateful to Major Holmes and for all he did for him# 4 # The Shaikh apparently spent a good deal of time out at the oil works in Bahrain, and was highly impressed, as it was no doubt intended he should be# Ke talked much of the n gushing n oil that he saw around him etc# etc# 5 # Major Holmes* move was a clever piece of pro paganda, and was of course his reply to the recent invitation of the A#P.O#C# to personally conduct the Shaikh round 'Fields' at Masjid Sulaiman# Looking back on events I have little doubt now in my own mind that it was Major Holmes who largely put into the Shaikh's mind that to land in Persia was unsafe, and then having disposed of the A.r.O.C#, planned the Bahrain expedition just to show what he could do# As I have already informed you, on his return ±1 to Kuwait, Major Holmes had an official invitation awaiting the Shaikh from the Eastern and G-eneral Syndicate asking him to be their guest in London during the coming summer# This was duly presented to the Shaikh, and looked very well# 7 # Major Holmes* sudden midnight departure for Basrah and London on 29th December 1932 I have not been able to fathom yet# He was discourteous enough not to inform me, even by a short note, of his intended departure# He just dis appeared.% -3- 0 # I mention the above facts rather at length for your information solely and to show you the type of man our Major Hotaes is. 9 # A point worth mentioning I think is the fact that during the past 10 days or so, there has been a consider able amount of anti A .P .O.C. propaganda in Kuwait* It may or may not have its origin in Major Holmesa Personally I rathe think it started with him, and was deliberately spread by his various Jackals' in the Town. Of course one will never be able to prove tthis. The propaganda has taken the form of malicious gossip against the A .P .O.C. in the matter of their dispute with Persia, is quoted as a very good example of what a dangerous thing it is for a small and weak State to feave dealings with a powerful company whose principal shareholder is the British G-overnment. These latter are made out to be oppressors of the weak and ever ready to trample on the rights of small nations and communities. In fact Britain^ policy today is made out to be ptffc of running away from people who stand up to her, and bullying those who are too weak to do so. 10 # Of course I realize that the above propaganda may emanate from Persia, but I prefer to put my finger on Major Holmes.86/1 &amp; 82/1 Telegram R 30 From Political Agent, Kuwait.

CF CuNVai^ATION • In a note from the British foreign Secretary, dated April 9, 1932 {Mo. S 1755/121/91j, regarding an applicatior of the astern ana General syndicate,Limited, t&gt;r an oil concession in Kuwait» reference is made to the extended period of time that oil companies have heen interested in oil lands in Kuwait. The Eastern and General Syndicate initiated and carried on negotiations with the Shaikh of Kuwait for an oil concession in his Principality with the knowledge and approval of the British Government hut it was not unt-l after American interests hecame associated in the venture with tte oynuicate in 1927 that the British Government required (in 1928) the inclusion in the concession agreement of a 'nationality clause', which clause would have the effect ol excluding any hut purely British interests from exploiting such a concession. Thus the Syndicate for years prior to 1927 and in agreement with American interests since 1927 has continuous ly endeavoured to obtain a concession in Kuwait very similar in principle to a concession which, with the knowledge of the British foreign Oifice, had been granted to the Syndicate in the Bahrain Islands. Last Lecemher American interest in the Kuwait concession formed the hasis of representations hy the American Ambassador to the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affiirs. In referring to these representations, the Foreign uifice note of April 9, men^ioneu auove, stated that 'His Majesty's Government for their part are prepared to agree to the omission from any oil concession, which the Shaikh may he prepared to grant, of a clause confining it..2- 'to British interests On Septamlaer 6,1952, however, the American ^bassy, in a note to the Foreign Office urged that early appropriate stejs might he taken, that this statement become effective, and that the American interests involved might he placed in as favourable a position as a British Oil company in having its application considered hy the Shaikh of Kuwait. In acknowledging this note ot September 6, a foreign Office note in reply stated; 'His Majesty 9 8 Government decided they could not advise the Shaikh to give ureferantial treat ment to the ^astern and General Syndicate rt # In the opinion of the Department of State, some misunderstanding may exist, in the mind of the British Government in this connection, since no preferential treatment has heen asked for American interests, n .r has any heen granted# It may he recalled that the American Amhassador, in discussing the Kuwait Oil concession with Sir John Simon last December, pointed out that the ISasLem and G -eneral Syndicate had initiated and carried on its negotiations with the shaikh with the knowledge and approval of the British Government; that the Syndicate had offered the Anglo-Persian Oil Company the opportunity, over six years ago, to interest itself in the Kuwait Oil concession which opportunity that company declined; that according to his information it was only after efforts to interest the Anglo- ersian Oil Company and other British groups in the saici concession that the Syndicate sought to interest and, in November 1927, succeeded in interesting the American company since then associated with it in the venture; that it was after these American interests became associated with the Syndicate in 1927 that the British Government in 1928 insisted upon the inclusion of a 'nationality clause' 1 which■e r -3- wblcU for a period of several years from tUat date uaa prevented the Syndicate from consummating with the Shaikh the concession it sought. Since the withdrawal of the Anglo -Persian Oil Company in 1926, it is only, 1 unuerstanu, during this last year U931-1932) of the Sastern and General Syndicate's negotiations that the Anglo-Persian Oil Jompany iin October 1931) manifested further interest in Kuwait. On the contrary, the Syndicate has been conducting it^ negotiations with unceasing activity for many years. it may also he recalled that it was not until April of this year that the British Government reached any decision to the urgent representations initiated hy the American Ambassador in the latter part of last year# In a most recent Foreign Office note it was staoeu. that the An^lo-Persian Oil Company suhmittea a urait concession for consideration in August last, and stuay of this Anglo-Persian draft will necessitate further ana considerable delay in His Majesty's Governmem*s reaching any concUsion regarding the draft concession which suh- sequent to receipt of the Foreign Office note of April 9, 1932, the Sastern and General Syndicaoe submitted to the Shaikh on May 26, thus renewing its application for the Kuwait oil concession which, as ahove indicated, it has heen negotiating in association with American interests unremittingly for many years# With reference to representations made 'by the American Ambassador to the Foreign Secretary in December, it may he well to draw attention to General i^awes* let ter to Sir John Simon of December 22, pointing out the * inin^ Lease Act of February 25,1920, regardxng lands unaer which British subjects are given the same treatment as American citizens• ••••1 -4- citizens. The text of this letter reads as follows^ •London, Deceaiber 22,1931# H My dear Sir J ohm •In furtherance of my remarks to you the other day regarding the Kuwait Oil concession, I venture to set forth below the pertinent section of the United States Mining Lease Act of February 25,1920, under which you will notice that British subjects receive the same treatment as American citizens: w (Public-No. 146-66th Congress) •(S. 2775). • An Act To promote the mining or coal, phosphate, oil, oil shale, gas and sodium on the public domain. 'Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.

That citizens of another country, the laws, customs, or regulations of which, deny similar or like privileges to citizens or corporations of this country, shall not by stock ownership , stock holding, or stock control, own any interest in any lease acquired under the provisions of this Act.* M In discussing this with the representatives of the interested company here, he informed me that the Syndicate concerned has already advised the Colonial Off ice tua t the same mtionality conditions as incorporated tyr theColonial Office in the case of the Bahrain oil concession, which the Embassy discussed with the Foreign Office in 1929 (reference: Foreign Office note No 0 S 2521/281/91 of May 29,1929) areare acceptable in the case of the Kuwait concession* I understand the Bahrain concession was assigned to the Bahrain Petroleum Company, the Canadian subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of California^ In this connection a statement to me by the syndicate representative may be of interest to you, '•The agreement entered into between the Eastern and General Syndicate, Limited, with the Eastern tfulf Oil Company stipulates that the nominee of the Eastern Gulf Oil Company will be a Canadian or English Corporation, at the election of the Eastern Gulf Oil Company• A copy of this agreement has been in the possession of the Colonial Office (in its consideration of the Kuwait oil concession) since December 26th, 192S, the same having been furnished to the Colonial Office by the Eastern andGeneral Syndicate,Limited** h A 8 stated to you the other day, the discussions have been so long delayed that I should be most appreciative of s an early word of reply. Yours sincerely, (Signed) CHARLES G.BAWES. W In conlttsion, it may be realised from the above facts that for more than four years American interests, in agreement with the Syndicate, have been seeking to obtain an oil conces sion in Kuwait, and for approximately the last year of that time representations have been made by the American Embassy, seeking for its nationals in this natter such opportunities as British subjects receive in the United States. In this connection, the American Embassy pointed out only recently that opportunity to American interests seems to be obstructed by the arbitrary decision of His Majesty 4 s (rovernment, as set forth in the Foreign Office note to tMs Embassy of September 16, containing a refusal to inform the Eastern and General Syndicate at this time whether that portion of the draft concession submitted by it(namely Clause 8) was satisfactory from ....SSSSmSBammmamt&amp;sssaasiBs~~-~-T from the point of view of safeguarding the interests of his Majesty's Government, and, if not, to state wherein the said conditions failed to satisfy in safeguarding the interests of Hi s MaJ esty • s (Joveminent. The Department of State has therefore instructed the American Embassy to review the facts with the Foreign Office and to request that this matter, which has been delayed for over a period of four years, may be expedited by the British authorities to the end that such action may be taken as will permit the Shaikh now to come to a decision*^Received under India Office endorsement .No. COPY.

As regards the instructions to be sent to Colonel Fowle, Sir Samuel Hoare would suggest that the Political Resident might be informed that, as he was aware, it was very desirable frcm the point of view of His Majesty's Government to reach a definite decision on this question, in view of the strong pressure which is •...

IBX^oremHer .932 Sir, With reference to foreign uffice letter xio .js.by2y/12l/ 91 of 15th jNOT «i1jer ,1932, to the Colonial office, in which it is suggeetcd that the Inter -departmental Meeting proposed toy the Admiralty to discuss the telegraphic instructions to toe sent to the iPalitical Resident, jl&gt;ersian uulf, in the matte-- of the Kuwait Oil Concession, might toe unnecessary if the instructinns proposed in India Office letter Mo 6809/32 of 12th Woveratoer to Colonial Office were acceptaLxe other Departments, I am commanded by lly Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to offer the following observations for the consideration of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. 2. ihe implication to toe drawn from the wording of para graph 3 of the India Office letter appears to toe that the ftolitical Resident should confine his advice to the shaikh to strictly impartial explanations of the jpetroleum uepa. tment' analysis and should take no steps to influence the shaikh's decision. yiey/ of the great strategic importance attaching to the development of oil supplies in the j?ersian uulf area by bona fide British Companies, uy Lords are of opinion that no legitimate step which might influence the shaikh of Kuwait to ... The Under Secretary of State, COLONIAL OFFICE.(£) -2- n to award the oonoeBBion to the Anglo -Persian oil Company rather than to the vnerioan intereete acting under the cloak of the Eastern ana ueneral syndicate should he neglect- ,d. although they fully adnit that it is essential that the hurden of choice must ultimately rest entirely with the Shaikh. My Lords therefore consider that the instructions to the Political Kesident should point out that it is ox the utmost importance that the Shaikh should give his decision in favour of the Anglo -Persian uil Company and that the Political Resident should neglect no legi-ina-e step -o ensure his taking this decision provided that the ultimate decision can Ise made to appeal' to have been entirely that of the Shaikh himself and that no greund is given to the American interests concerned for an accusation against his Majesty 's Government of having brought undue influence ox pressure to bear upon t-iie Shaikh. ^^ uy Lords also consider it desirable to a c that should an opportunity arise to tender his advice to the Shaikh the Political uesident, in addition to explaining any doubtful points in the Petroleum department's analysis, might well refer also to the following points.- (i) That as nothing is yet known as to whether the field will 'be a cheap or an expensive one to work anci as at present there is a considerable world over-production of oil, there may well be a strong inducement to limit production from the Kuwait field rather than to increase it. In these circumstances the 'bird in the hand' of the Anglo-Persian uil Company's ofler seems to be worth considerably more than the nwo in the bush M of the Kactern and general Syndicate's draft concession. (ii) ...•w (ii) The wide experience of the Anglo -Persian fliil Company in this area enables them to offer a fair economic royalty, combined with a higher minimum payment. The Kastern and General Syndicate, on the other hand, being almost entirely without local experience, offer a higher royalty and a lower minimum payment but would seum to be themselves doubt® ful whether the royalty which they offer is economically possible since their draft concesi &amp;ion provides for a complete cessation of work for any time up to two years during which no payments would accrue to the bhaikh. be I am to suggest that the whole matter should now be considered by the Middle Kast Official Sub-Conmittee of the Committee of imperial defenceo 6. Copies of this letter have been sent to foreign Office, India Office and Petroleum department. I am etc., (ogd) J• b. Barne s.SECRET* D»0»n©#213« sn 1 &lt;^(y \l Polltloal Agency, Kuwait. Dated the 28tli December 1932, /•/ .(V\ I Will you refer to your confidential No«916 dated the 16th Deoember and enclosure, Admiralty letter M#0E977/32 of 18th Norember to the Colonial Office, on the subject of the Kuwait Oil Concession. g # The Admiralty's letter if I may say so is rather to the point, and largely roices my own views# You remember X discussed the question with you, as to what would happen, and in idiose favour the Shailch would be likely to decide (Anglo Persian Oil Company or The General Eastern Syndicate) after he receires His Majesty's aorermaenVs final criticisms on the two draft agreements. 4 :# Presumably His Majesty^ Gorernment*s final letter will take the form of a comparative statement, showing where the A.PO.C's offer is superior to that of the Eastern and General Syndicate, and vice versa. Presumably also they will not adrise the Shaikh as to which of the two concessions it would be to his advantage to accept. If jay presumption is correct and this happens| I have the uncomfortable feeling that the Shaikh .7111 express his gratitude and thanks to His Majesty^ Govermaent for all the trouble they have taken in his interest, to make the matter so clear, and will then proceed to give the concession to the Eastern and General Syndicate. The Hon f ble Lieutenant—Colonel TeC .WeFowle, C»B.S., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R E.to You. may ask tt vrhy/the Eastern end General Syndicate, and not to the Anglo Persian Oil Company?'. My reply is that the Shaikh will he influenced to some extent by the foilowings- (a). His 10 years* personal friendship witfi Holmes; during which time he has receired a hundred and one kindnesses from him in the shape of pre sent s^ advice, sympathy etc., (b). His inherent nerrousness of theA.P.O.C. because of the fact that His Majesty's Oorernment has the controlling interest. (c). The feeling that he has not had fair dealing from His Majesty^ (Government in the natter of the Blockade and his Date Gardens. (d). His Nejdi failing of getting as many foreign persons as possible interested in his country, as by so doing he thinks to be able to play them all off to his advantage. (This is today one of Bin Saud^ principle methods of procedure and is a typically Nejdian trait). 7, In my opinion His Majesty^ Government must direct bring a certain amount of/preeaure on the Shaikh else the chances are I fear about 6 to 4 on Holmes 1 winning the game. 8, If His Majesty's Government fears to adopt thfcs course out of consideration for American feelings (for the life of me I do not see why they should be), then the only other way is to get the A.P.0.0. to make the financial advantages they are prepared to offer, at least 40% greater all along the line, than those of the Bastern and General Syndicate. 'Cupidity' will then come into play, and the Shaikh will I think fall to the A.P.O.C. gun. 9, At present the figures offered by the Anglo Persian Oil Company are too closely similar to those yzMttv \©,.i -3- to those promised by the Eastern end Ckn^ereil oyndloate, to make n® feel happy* ^0, As perhaps you would like to send my ▼iews to London, I am enclosing a duplicate copy of this.1 ANGLO PERSIAN OIL COMPANY LIMITED No. 72 - C/7.

The Middle East Official iiub-Gommittee at their meeting on the 2nd December recommended under Conclusion 1 (c) that the final sentence should be omitted from the statement drawn yp vy the Petroleum Department, when that statement is submitted to the Shaikh of Kuwait, on the ground that the subject of this sentence is a matter for the Political Resident to arrange with the Shaikh. The sentence referred to embodies a suggestion to the effect that, when the Shaikh has made his choice between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Eastern and General Syndicate, he should make the grant of a concession conditional upon the emandation of the draft concession submitted by the successful competitor in such a way as to cover any points upon which His Majesty's Government may recommemd him to insist. This is evidently a matter of importance both to His Majesty's Government and the Shaikh.

Sir, f The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty have had under consideration your letter 98026/11/3 2 of the 10th December, enclosing the drafts of two telegrams which it is proposed to address to the Resident in the Persian Gulf concerning the two apppications now under consideration for an oil concession in Kuwait. In view of the general conclusions reached at the meeting of the Official Sub-Committee for questions concerning the Middle East on the 2nd December, My Lords concur in the despatch of the two telegrams, subject to the following observations:- The words 'questions at issue have now been discussed with other Government Departments and' at the beginning of the first telegram appear to be superfluous and might conceivably convey an erroneous impression of general departmental agree ment . The draft of the private and personal telegram to the Political Resident contains no special reference to Admiralty |Vf letter No.M.02977 of the 18th November. My Lords consider it is important that the letter should be mentioned and that the Resident should be aware that the views expressed in it are shared by the Service Departments. Accordingly they propose that an addition to the telegram be made in the sense that **Admiralty views as expressed in Admiralty letter of 18th November are shared by War Office and Air Ministry'. - My/ The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office,My Lords infer from the views expressed by representatives of other departments interested tnat we are deeply committed to the U.S.Government in this matter and that it is for this reason that it is not desired to stress the advantages which both H.M, (iovernment and the Shaikh may be expected to derive from the grant of the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. If this were not so and we were free to offer our unfettered advice to the Shaikh, My Lords would have preferred to explain the position more fully to him. It appears to Their Lordships to be possible that the Shaikh may consider us lacking in candour if we refrain from disclosing onr own wishes, which must necessarily weigh with him in coming to a decision from the point of view of his own interests and those of his ^haikh- dom.

Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir Philip Cunlif fe-Lister to acknowledge the receipt of your letter ol' the 2lBt Dec ember, o.M.03274/52, from which he is glad to observe that the Lords Gornmiasioner8 of the Admiralty are preapred to concur genera31y in the despatch of the two telegrams which it is proposed to address to the Political Resident m the Persian Gulf concerning the applications now under consideration for an oil concession in Kuwftit, 2, Uo objection is seen to the omission of the words questions at issue and 11 at the beginning of the first telegram, as suggested by Their Lordships. 3. tfith regard to the private and personal telegram to the Political Resident, it is understood that it is considered very important both by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for India that this telegram should contain nothing of a character calculated to lay especial emphases on any particular aspect of the correspondence. Moreover, copies of the Admiralty letter (M.02977/32) of the 18th of November were despatched to the Political Resident by air mail on the 25th of November and by sea mail on the 24th of November from the India Office, while copies of the War Office letter No.0179/l01(M.0.2.) of/ The Secretary, Admiralty, S.W.I.-2- of the 13th of December and of the Air Ministry letter i^o. S.31084/S,6 of the 14th of December have been despatched by air mail leaving England on the 17th of December# The Foliticci.1 Resident will therefore be in possession of this correspondence epxressing, as it does, the support of the Army Council and the Air Council for the views expressed by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. 4, In order, however, to make quite certain that Lieutenant Colonel Fowle has the correspondence before him when he confers with Colonel Dickson, it is proposed to request him by telegraph to acknowledge the receipt of the air mail packet which left London im the 17th of Decemberm and he will also be invited to state on what date he expects Colonel Dickson to join him at Bushire. Should it then appear that there is any risk of Colonel Dickson's reaching Bushire before the arrival of the air mail the 17th of December, it will be possible to instruct the Political Resident to delay the discussions with Colonel ~ickson until the arrival of that Air Mail. It is thought that this course will provide am|)le safeguards and will ensure that the views of the Service Departments are fully before the Political Resident and the Political Agent at Kuwait. 5. In these circumstances I am to express the hope that iheir Lordships will agree that the telegram should be despatched as drafted, and, in view of the increasing urgency of the matter, I am to ask that they will cause a reply to be returned to this letter at the earliest possible date. It wilil be observed from the letter addressed by Colonel Murray to Mr. Warner on the 19th of December( a copy of which has been sent to the Admiralty,* that the War Department agrees that the telegram need not now be amplified, and it is understood semi-officially that the Air Ministry also agrees. 6./-3- 6.

It is not usual to impose a Customs Duty in addition to royalty. Such a charge mi^it with some Justifi cation be levied in a country where the State does not own the mineral rights and desires to secure some financial considei&gt; atlon for the loss of a wasting asset such as petroleum. But where the State is the owner of the minerals it is regarded as preferable that the State should take the whole of its financial return in the shape of royalty. Apart from the principle involved there is bound to be some difficulty in assessing the value of the oil for purposes of the duty, whether at thethe well beady or port of shipment. There are eome oases In which royalty is charged on the basis of a percentage of the ralue of the oil wen, and endless difficulty has arisen in finding a satisfactory method of determining the value# In 'Trinidad, where the Ck *rerxa »nt owns the greater part of the s &amp;inerals and the question has been thoroughly considered, the idea of an export tax has been definitfcly abandoned as unsuitable. acmaral Obaaryatlong.

The memorandum comparing the drafts is produced by the Petroleum Department of the British Government and two copies of it are contained in the volume (folios 48-64, 153-161).Also included in the volume is correspondence between the US Embassy in London and the Foreign Office regarding what the US embassy view as unacceptable delays in the amount of time it has taken the British Government to discuss the question of the Kuwait concession and repeating their concerns that the Eastern and General Syndicate will not be compared favourably alongside the British A.P.O.C. proposal. Also outlined by the Foreign Office are their fears that the Government's delays in responding to the US in this matter could potentially affect more serious negotiations in the future between the two countries.Other items of interest in the volume include:Letters from the Admiralty and the Army Council expressing their concerns over strategic and military assets in the Gulf should American interests be permitted to acquire the oil concession in Kuwait;Enquiries from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Secretary of State for India asking if anything can be done to assist the Shaikh of Kuwait with his grievances regarding his date gardens in Iraq and Ibn Sa'ud's blockade;A letter from the Secretary of State, Foreign Office (on behalf of the Secretary for Mines) to the Director of the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited outlining the history and background to an oil concession in Kuwait dating back to 1917 when A.P.O.C. first undertook preliminary examinations in Kuwait and Bahrain (folios 76-81);Details of proposals by A.P.O.C. to increase the financial offer of their concessionLetter from the Political Agent in Kuwait to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf regarding anti-A.P.O.C. and anti-British propaganda which is being circulated in Kuwait (folios 106-108).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Admiralty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Eastern and General Syndicate Limited, oil company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for the Colonies, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Embassy to the United Kingdom, London</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Division</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Frank Holmes</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Kuwait</topic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Propaganda</topic></subject><subject><topic>Bilateral relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial policy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military policy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000266#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
