Knowing well that slaves are not permitted to be kept, my son, before he accepted her services when she was offered to him as present by Hosein Bin Neama of G-ater as a token of his (my son's) visit there, explicitly asked this woman wether she would be willing to come and work only as a servant, and she agreed, as has already been stated to you by my son, and doubtless also by the woman to you. When she arrived at my house I also made it clear to her that she would work as a servant if she liked if not I would arrange for her to return at once. Then also she willingly consent ed to remain, and it was my intention to fix her a salary later on according to her work. She is not a minor and since she of her free will agreed to serve, I saw there was nothing wrong in keeping her as I did in the capacity of a maid servant, otherwise I would never have kept her but still if you take her as a slave and think she has no freedom at my humble place, I certainly would not object to j' 4 your letting her go. I think therefore that you have acted under a misapprehension in keeping my son under custody and only releasing him on a cash security of Rs,5000/- which I sent to you immediately you ordered.Mohamad Sharif H.
