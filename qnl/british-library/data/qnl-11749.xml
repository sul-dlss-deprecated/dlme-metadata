Right of centre, one peak is identified as ‘Sugar Loaf’ or ‘Gebel Yemmenere’: this may refer to Jabal Jimām, a mountain due east across the coastal plain from Hodedda.At far left several windmills are indicated; to their right a structure with high walls and a domed roof, which may indicate a mosque or mausoleum. Further mosques are indicated at right along with a fortified structure at far right.The middle image is a hastily sketched out series of mountains; inscriptions indicate locations that cannot be verified such as ‘Sennam’ and ‘Gebel ‘Ulmayer’.The lower image may be a continuation of the upper topographical view. Fortifications lead from far left towards the centre, while the highest peaks in the range of mountains in the background are identified as ‘Saddle Hill’ or ‘Gebel Addar’.On the verso a further hastily sketched out topographical view shows some low-lying tents or other structures along a coastline, with mountains in the background.Inscriptions:Recto:Above upper image, in pencil: ‘Sugar Loaf or Gebel Yemmenere.’Below upper image, in pencil: ‘[lost]ddah’Above middle image at left, in pencil: ‘Semman’; ‘end of [illegible] Bay [illegible]’; ‘Gebel Ullmeyer.’Above lower image, at left, in pencil: ‘Saddle hill’; ‘Gebble Addar’Verso:Upper left corner, in pencil: ‘WD3534’Above image, in pencil: ’Towards the end of Judda [sp?] Bay to the North &amp;’; ‘Northern part of the range left of the Town Domarrar[sp?]’</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Thomas Elwon</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">artist</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Hodedda</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100025656138.0x000002#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
