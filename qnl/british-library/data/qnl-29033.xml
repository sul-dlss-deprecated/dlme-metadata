To The Secretary to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian 3ulf, BUSH IRS. Memorandum. I enclose herewith copies of tvfo successive reports received from the Head Cleric, Bandar Abbas, in connection with an Omani dhow, which was seized by the Cus to ins motor dhow Ilo.b, and brought to Bandar Abcas for trial, for your information, and such action as you deem fit in the matter. ad. C.H.Lincoln, Maj or. H.B.M.*8 Consul, KermanCopy of report dated 24th October 1936 from Head Cleric Bandar Abbas to Consul, Kerman. I beg to report that on the 22nd instant, the Customs launch No.5 under Nakhuia Abdullah Kishnsy with Ardashiri, the Customs Inspector on board, brought one dhow .vith her crew wno were all Arabs from Oman. The dhow had firewood as her cargo ana two rifles on board. She was bound from Batenah i or Khasab, It seems due to bad weather she was bound to cross the Guli . she was caught while she was under sail. It does not seem that she had anchored at any Iranian Port. The Customs claim that tney have right to arrest any vessel bearing arms on board in Persian waters. The brew are in Shahrabani pending trial by Customs. Por information please.Copy of report dated the 27th October 1936 from Head Clerk, Baiidar Abbas, to H.B.H.’e Consul, Kerman. II In continuation of my report dated the 24th instant, regarding the Omani dhow, I beg to report the further development for your information. ?he boat in question was from Xhasab and bound for Dubai, she had on board as passengers one Arab woman and her daughter. ^he crew including the passengers were handed over to the Military Authorities on the 26th to be tried by Diwan-e-Harb (Court Martial). The Diwan-e-Harb will try them for carrying arms in Persian v/aters. There is also a rumour that the boat was caught near Coral Island10 Telegrsan R. 35 N ' © From H.M.’a ill n is ter, Tehran.

I learn that Omani dhotf carrying firewood from Khasab to Dibai and having two rifles on board was seized by Customs launch off Bandar Abbas on October 22nd. Crew were handed over to military authorities for trial by martial law on charge of carrying firearms in Iranian waters. It would appear that dhow was outside three mile but within twelve mile limit and that she was driven by bad v/eather. Political Resident states it is common practice for dhows to carry small quantities of arms for self protection. 2. (Here insert text of my immediately succeeding telegram). -SEYMOUR. —Telegram S.

I am endeavouring to ascertain poiition more accurately. I presume that there is clear case for protest if dhow was outside 12 mile limit but do you wish me t o protest if as is probable she was within limits claimed by Iranian Government but outside those recognised by His Majesty’s Government. 7/e cannot hope for satisfaction in latter event but action is perhaps necessary in order to maintain our position over arms traffic ?in territorial waters. 2. Likelihood of alternative issue is that of charge brought against crew. There seems to have been no attempt to smuggle and I know of no law declaring illegal the carriage of arms in a foreign ship innocently passing through Iranian waters. There would h; rdly seem to be grounds for protest while matter is aub judice but I could ask to be informed of exact nature of charge in ho^e that informal discussion of case will convince authorities that there are no grounds for prosecution. 3.

Political Resident’s Seizure of a Kuwaiti dhow minute dated the 6th April by Irai ian Customs 1937. Authorities at ^usbeh. iNOTE Subject: Seizure of a Kuwaiti dhow by Iranian Customs Authorities at fyTJ SBEH. I discussed this case with Captain de Gaury at Kuwait* Captain de Gaury explained that this case was a typical one. The Iranian Government have forbidden Iranians to own dhows built in Kuwait, and presumably this order applies to dhows built anywhere on the Arab Coast, The idea behind this order is that the Iranians should build their own dhows. This, however, they can’t do. An Iranian, therefore, wishing to own a Kuwait built dhow, gets the dhow registered in Kuwait nominally as belonging to a Kuwait merchant. The dhow then flies the Kuwait flag but to all intents and purposes is an Iranian craft, since it is really owned by an Iranian and the Captain is Iranian as are the crew. 2. If such dhows are seized by the Iranians, as in the present case, therefore, we are really on a bad wicket in protesting. Captain de Gaury will explain the position to the Shaikh and in future the reports from Kuwait or other posts on the Arab side of the seizure of any dhow should ment ion if the dhow does or does not come within this doubtful category. 3, A copy of this note should go to Political Agents Kuwait, Bahrain and Muscat.

Monsieur le Ministre, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that my attention has recently been drawn to two cases in which ships of the Imperial Iran i a: Navy have interfered with Arab vessel; within Arab territorial waters. 2. The first incident took place on the 25th January (5th Bahman). On that date H.I.M.S.'Babr” stopped and searched two dhows belongint to Debai. The first dhow was searched two miles north east of Quoin Island, and the second one mile from Quoin Island. Both dhows were therefore stopped within the territorial waters of the Sultan of Muscat. The first dhow is the property of Muhammad Khan of Debai, and its Nakhuda is named Ahmed Ali Harmuzi, The second belongs to a relative of Muhammad Khan and its Nakhuda is Hasan Tahlak. The two dhows carried passengers and cargoes of salt, dates and clothing for the Bat in eh coast. The cargoes His Excellency Monsieur Enayatollah of both dhows were searched, being Saipiy, Minister for Foreign Affairs, prodded / Tehran.2 - prodded with a steel prong, and the baggage and clothing of the passengers and crews were also searched. After completion of the search, the dhows were allov/ed to proceed. The second incident took place on the 16th February (27th Bahman). On that date an unnamed jolly-boat, belonging to Debai, sailed from Khassab to Debai with a Cyidargo of dried fish. The jolly-boat is the property of Humail bin Khalfan al Basti of Debai, and the Nakhuda is named Ali bin Hasan ash-Shahi of Xhassab. At about noon on the 16th February (27th Bahman) an Iranian warship was sighted coming from the direction of Hen jam. The name of this warship is not known, but it is believed that she was H. I .S. rt Chahrok^ji”. When the jolly-boat was off Ghamda (between Bakha and Sha’am) she .vas overtaken by the warship, which stopped a few yards distant from her. Both vessels were then about one mile from the shore. The ^akhuda was ordered to go aboard the warship, where he was questioned about the nationality of his boat, himself and his crew. He was then allowed to proceed. 4* Your ISxcellency will observe that in both these cases, Arab vessels from Debai were stopped by Iranian warships actually within Arab territorial voters. In these circumstances I must make to Your Excellency a strong protest at /at these further cases of interference with Arab vessels outside Iranian territorial waters* In my note No.112 of the 11 th March (20th Esfand 1315) I had the honour to remind Y^ur Excellency that incidents of this nature could not but maxe a most unfortunate impression. I have no doubt that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India will view these further incidents with much concern, and I would therefore again earnestly request Your Excellency, in the interests of the friendly relations so happily existing between those Governments and the Imperial Government, to cause strict instructions to be issued to the Commanding Officers of His Imperial Majesty’s ships to abstainlfrom inter ference with Arab vessels outside Iranian territorial waters. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to lour Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration. (signed) H.J.SEYMOURCONFIDENTIAL. No. 366-S of 1937.

On tne one occasion when a few years ago a British sloop came on the scene when a Persian warship was interfering with an Arab dnow, tne Persian snip made off in great haste long before iUM.Snip came up witn the dhow* 4. j4y Lords nevertheless consider it to be important tnat hoM*Snips should nave clear authority to use force if necessary, on / The under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, 3.W.I.on the high eeaa as well as in Arab territorial waters* they suggest, therefore, that the instructions should take the form that, in the event of an Arab dnow being interfered with in the presence of a British warship, the latter should communicate with the Persian warship, warn her that she is conmitting an illegal act and, if necessary, take the dnow in tow and take such other steps as are necessary to ensure tnat sne is not further interfered with. They would point out tnat unless tne Instructions are in tne sense suggested above, there is always the possibility, however remote, that a Persian war vessel might persist in her interference in the presence of and in spite of remonstrances by a British warship. If in such circumstances no attempt were made to resist tne illegal action of the Persian warship the effect upen our prestige amongst tne Arabs would be likely to be serious, 5« Ah additional reason for issuing instructions in tne sense proposed above is that (in spite of recent verbal communications by individual Persian officials) it seems likely tnat it will shortly be necessary to make a formal communication to tne Persian Government in the sense proposed in paragraph 6 of ur, Seymour’s memorandum - namely tnat *2:sx orders nave been given to H®M,Ships to prevent aqy interference with Arab dnows on tne high seas. In this connection, ineir -Loras concur witn tne views expressed in paragraphs 4 and S of the Political Kesident’s semi-official letter of tne 21st May, Any divecgence between tne language used at Tehran and tne instructions issued to rt.ii. Ships would clearly be open to objection, 5* Another suggestion contained in MroSeymour's memorandum is that in waters claimed by Persia as territorial, but not admitted as such by His Majesty’s Government, tne same course should /f i .Z.8003/37 India Office, Whitehall, 8 .W.I. 14th iieceiaber, 1937.

My Lords note that Lord Halifax considers that the balance of advantage lies in including waters off the Iranian coast outside the tnree-mile limit, but within the six-mile limit, in t he scfcpe of the proposed instructions authorising Commanding Officers to use force in the last resort to prevent interference on the high seas* Lord Halifax then suggests, however, that in order to reduce the risk of a serious incident within the six-mile limit, further, possibly seEDet, instruct ions should be given to Commanding Officers that they should, so far as possible, contrive to avoid witnessing incidents which may occur within the six-mile limit, 3 0 My Lords have given careful consideration to Lord Halifax*s suggestion, but regret that they are unable to agree that Commanding Officers* discretion should be limi- -ted by such secret instructions. They do not consider that it would be in fact practicable to instruct H.M.Ships5^1 2 . enter tne aix-mile limit. It would not, for instance, be possible, without serious detriment to our prestige for H.M toips patrolling outside the six-mile limit either to ignore an incident which they may observe within the s ix- -nuie limit, or tail to pursue, if necessary, an offending rerslan vessel up to tne limit of waters claimed by ue as the high sees. The damage to our prestige would be all the more serious if, as would now be thee ase, it were public knowledge that we had authorised resistance to \ Persian interference outside Persian territorial waters. It would therefore seem necessary, if the risk of incidents is to be avoided in tne manner suggested by Lord Halifax for H.M.Ships to be instructed to keep, not only outside the six mile limit, but at a distance from it sufficient to ensure that they did not witness any incident occurring within the six miles, or likely to involve pursuit beyond that limit. My Lords do not, however, consider t hat any auch instruction would be desirable in principle or practical, those suggested by Lord Halifax would, not, in fact, avoid the risk of incidents, and would, My Lords consider, merely introduce an undesirable element of doubt in Commanding Officers' instructions which would make decision in particular cases difficult and embarassingT a* explained in Admiralty letter M.03427/37 of tne 10th Septemner, 1937, they do not consider that the risk of a serious Incident arising is great, and, for the reasons explain,* above, they would be Slad if Lord Halifax could agree to the issue of the instruc- -tions without the proposed reservation. 4- My Lords have also considered the proposal that H.H.Ships should undertake to see that suspected vessels proceed/-/ 3 proceed to their alleged destination, and that offences are investigated and punished. To be effective, this would involve escorting the dhow to its alleged destina- -tion. The actual destination of such dhows would i presuoably be generally within •r’ersian waters^ the a for operational reasons. As regards the investigatTou and punishment ol offences, Thier Lordtthips consider that the proposal in paragraph 9 of Admiralty letter of 10th September, 1937, would be sufficient to cover cases of suspected arms running. It is observed, nowever, tnat the activities of Persian warships appear at present to be mainly directed towards the suppression of smuggling, and its would not seem possible for an/ undertaking to be given that offences which are offences against Persian law will ce investigated and. punished elsewhere* A copy of this letter is being sent to the India Office.

With reference to your predecessor's submission -vo.504 /Jj.• 1,3273/4 of 19th May 1937, I am to communicate to you the following instructions coneerning the action to be taken by H.M.Ships in the Persian dulf to protect vessels of the Arab Cheikhdoms under British protection if Iranian warships or customs vessels should attempt to interfere with them. 1 * Protection against interference by Iranian ships is to be atxorded by H.M. Ships in the territorial waters of the arab States under .British protection and on the high seas up to the limit of Iranian territorial waters recognised by His Majesty's Government. Notwithstanding, therefore, the claim advanced by the Iranian Government to a territorial belt six miles in width protection is to be given up to the three mile limit off the Iranian Gcast. 2 . If the Commanding Officer of one of H.M.Ships observes an Iranian warship or customs vessel interfering with a protected Arab vessel in the waters described in 1 above, he is to communicate with the Iranian ship and warn her that she is committing an illegal act. 3* II the Iraiiian ship does not thereupon releaserelease the Arab vessel, H.M.Ship is to take the latter in tow, and adopt such measures as may be necessary to ensure that no further interference occurs# 4* If the Iranian ship opposes such action with force the Commanding Officer of H.M.Ship is authorised to use such force as may be necessary to effect the release of the Arab vessel. 5. If the Iranian ship attempts to justify her action by alleging that the Arab vessel is engaged in the arms traffic, the Commanding Officer of H.15.Ship should reply that if the allegation proves correct he will see that the offenders are properly dealt with in accordance with the laws to which they are subject* and he is subsequently to take the necessary measures in collaboration with the Political Resident and his staff to ensure that this promise is fulfilled. 6 . If an incident occurs v/ithin the six mile limit but outside the three mile limit off the Iranian coast, and the Iranian ship justifies its action on the ground that these waters are Iranian territorial waters, the Commanding Officer of H.II.Ship is to reply that H.M. Government does not recognise such waters as territorial and that he cannot permit interference with Arab shipping outside the three mile limit. • ^ t 7. ihe utmost tacy and discretion are to be employed in dealing with any dispute which may airse, and every endeavour is to be made to obdain the release of the Arab vessel without the use of force, which should be employed only in the very last resort.

Monsieur le Mlnlstre, I have the honour to direct the attention of Your Excellency to the Increasingly frequent practice of interference by Iranian naval vessels with Koweiti and other Arab dhows, and to refer in particular to two recent cases of such interference which have been brought to the notice of His Majesty's Government. 2. His Majesty's Government are informed j (1) that on the 11th March one dhow was stopped at a point 30 miles North fcest of the island of Kh/arg by an Iranian naval vessel which caused serious damage in coming alongside. It appears that the boarding party failed to board the dhow owing to heavy seas; (2) that on the 18th March two dhows were stopped by an Iranian naval vessel 18 miles from the nearest point of the Iranian shore in the vicinity of Tahiri. Both these dhows were boarded and searched. A few articles were stolen and in each case a sum of 5s 1,000 was demanded, although the dhows were eventually released upon payment of a small levy. 3. I am to point out to Your Excellency that the dhows concerned in these incidents, which were returning to Koweit from India, were flying the flag of Koweit and were stationed well outside Iranian territorial waters when they were intercepted. I am therefore to ask you to be so good as to arrange for the issue of instructions to Iranian naval vessels not to interfere with foreign dhows on the high seas. I am further to emphasize that this practice of stopping koweiti and other Arab dhows on the high seas is likely to lead only to constant friction which it is the earnest desire of His Majesty's Government to avoid. 4. I shall be grateful to receive Y8ur Excellency's assurance that adequate measures will be taken by the competent Imperial authority to prevent a recurrence of such interference. 5. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration. Received under Foreign Office printed letter No. E.4632/66/91, dated the 3rd June, 1947.Mo.

Their Lordships feel that arrangements on the lines proposed are unnecessarily complicated, and that the risk of an incident leading to recourse to an international tribunal on the question of the proper extent of territorial waters can be discounted* They therefore suggest that the same instructions snould cover the whole of the high seas, up to the limit admitted by us as Persian territorial water. d 0 As regards possible interferences inside Arab territorial waters. Their Lordships would draw attention to the Muscat, Bahrain and Kuwait Proclamations made in 1393-1900 in connection with the arms traffic® Copies of these proclamations are appended for convenient reference® It will be seen tnat tney all confer upon Persian vessels tne rignt of searcn of Muscati, Bahraini and Kuwaiti dnows vritnin tne ruler’s own territorial waters* The question of tne cancellation of these proclamations naa recently been under consideration - see in tnis connection semi-official correspondence commencing witn Mr® Claus on* s letter P*Z.2970 of the lltn «iay and Foreign Office despatch no®204 to Tehran* Their Lordships consider that it is extremely unlikely that the Persian (iovermaeat are aware of these provisions, and they feel tnat it is not necessary to take open steps to cancel them - wnicn, as pointed out in tne corres pondence /correspondence referred to above* might draw attention to the Persian 'fi’irm&amp;n of 1897. They would point out moreover tnat these proclamations only relate to the suppression of the arms trade, whereas the present activities of tne foreign warsnips seem to be mainly directed to tne suppression of smuggling. 9a In order to cover tne point, Tneir Lordships suggest that the instructions to n.M.lhips should provide tnat if a Persian warship which is interfering with an Arab dhow attempts to justify her action to a British warship by alleging that tne vessel is engaged in tne arms traffic, tne Britisn Commanding Officer snould reply tnat, if the allegation proves to be correct, ne will see tnat tne offenders are properly dealt witn according to tne law to which they are subject; and tnat he should subsequently take tne necessary steps to ensure tnat this is done, acting in collaboration with tne political Resident and nis staff. It is understood that all tne Arab States in treaty relations witn rt.M.Government nave legislation pronibiting tneir subjects from engaging in tne arms traffic. 10. Tneir Lordsnips nave noted tnat in tne Political Resident's note dated 26tn Pebruary suggesting tne cancellation of the proclamations, it is stated in paragrapn 2 tnat under tne huscat Proclamation Persian vessels nave rignts of searcn of Muscat vessels on the nign seas. Tneir Lordships presume that tnis interpretation is based upon tne notification dated I 3 tn January, 1898, which was apparently issued at tne same time as tne proclamation and wnich states tnat 'in future our Muscat tlag will be no protection to vessels carrying tne said arms and amiunition from our dominions to India and Persia.” Tn ir Lordships would suggest tnat it is unnecessary to treat tnis notification as formally conveying powers of searcn upon tne nign /-5- §*9 nign seaa, and tnat it can be regarded as being no more tnan an intimation to tne lultan^ subjects tnat tney cannot expect tne support of their ruler if tney indulge in forbidden activities. On the assumption, therefore, that no other document exists which confers these powers in a more formal and definite manner, Their Lordships suggest that the matter would be adequately met if the instruction covering tne case where a Persian warship alleges that a dhow is engaged in tne arms traffic (see paragraph 9 above) were made applicable to any case of interference with an Arab dhow on the hign seas as well as in Arab territorial wat er s. 11. In reply to tne enquiry as to tne existing instructions in your letter of tne 7tn July, I am to state tnat Their Lord- snips nave been unable to trace that any specific instructions governing tne use of force nave been issued to n.m.
