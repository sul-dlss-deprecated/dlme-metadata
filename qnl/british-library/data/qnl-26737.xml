An alternative version is that tiie meeting will ca...- upon King Parouq to rule Palestine and appoint the hufti as^his Viceroy. It is understood that Ilaj Amin is now in Karachi as a guest of the Pakistan Government. 2. Whatever credence may he attached to these particular reports, it is worth noting that this will not be the Mufti's first participation in an Islamic Congress, and it is quite possible that he intends to re-assert his former influence by participating in another. 5 . i/a are convinf? this to all interested Foreign Office, London, S.W.l.
