From To Lieutenant-Colonel ILK.P.Dickson, C.I.E., Political Agent, Kuwait. The Secretary to His Excellency the High Commissioner for f Iraq, Baghdad.' / ■ ji kt Sir, ' r With reference to your memorandum No.8793 dated the 4th September 1930, forwarding certain documents from the ’Xrai Ministry of Justice Baghdad, which you requested me to serve oi His Excellency the Ruler of KUV/AIT. 2. I have the honour to inform you that while I did no1 consider it quite 'En regie” to serve the said documents, according to ordinary procedure, such as asking the Shaikh to accept the Summons and sign the receipt, I neverthless sent him the documents in question for perusal and any remarks he oared to make. His Excellency the Shaikh has now sent me his offic- ial reply dated the 19th Rabl’ II, 1349 (13th September 1930) translation of which I forward you for the information of ’Irao A ^ Minister of Justice, and has turned the documents, which are also enclosed (unsigned). 4t# His Excellency followed up his letter by calling on me the next day to explain certain aspects of the case. 5 * He i&amp;at the property had been purchased during the lifetime of Shaikh Mubarak 22 years ago (1909) and had come down through two rulers, i.e. Shaikh Jabir al- Subah and Shaikh Salim al-Subah to himself, and that throughout the whole of this period no claim had ever been put forward to any portion of the estate in question, either by the lady Hafiyaa, her mother the lady Sfcafiya, or anyone else. n ^ s Excellency next showed me a copy of the original deeds of sale of the property in question, on one of which- 2 - whioh the lady Shafiya mother of Rafiyaa bint An al~ Zubair the plaintlf in the present case, clearly declares that she is selling her share and those of her six minor children, one being her daughter Rafiyaa (mentioned by name Jin accordance with a 'WASIYA' granted her by the Turkish 'Mahkamat al Sharia; or official Religious Court of Basrah* was interesting to note also that the original deed of sale together with other documents pertaining to it were witnessed by all the leading notables of Basrah such as the Haqib etc. and were finally signed by His Britanic Majesty* Consul Basrah, Mr.Crow on February 12th 1909 and presumably registered in the Consulate. True copies of the deeds were taken later on 23rd May 1915 under signature of Colonel Grey His Britanic Majesty’s Political Agent at Kuwait and handed over to the Shaikh here. 8 * Today the original deeds are kept in possession of Abdul Aziz al—Salim His Rxcellenoy’s Agent and represent ative in Basrah, while the copies are retained in Kuwait. There are two curious features of the case which I think merit attention. (a) Firstly the claim concerns a portion of the FAPAGHITSH ESTATE, (bj becondiy the lady Rafiyaa has apparently already had the whole case carefully explained to her by the shaikh’s Agent, who has shown her all necessary documents connected with the original sale, more particularly the document signed by her mother in which the Courts granted her authority to sell her (the lady Rafiyaa’s) share. In spite of this the lady has chosen to go to law under what appear somewhat suspecious circumstances. 10 * 1 apologize for the length of this letter, but ' I think the details given above, may be found of interest by His Excellency the High Commissioner seeing that the claim concerns portion of the great Fadaghiyeh Estate, the second in importance of those owned by the Ruler of Kuwait and his family -3--3- family on the Sh&amp;fct - al - Arab and which is among those exempted from taxation by promise of His Majesty's Government.

In view of the observations contained in your letter it would appear that His Excellency the Shaikh has a good defence to the claim.

As I predicted, one of the heirs of the original owner of the property is about to file a suit (or might have done so by now) against the Shaikh of Kuwait for one third of the property. Personally, I do not wish to interfere in this matter, as one of the daughters of Ahmad Pasha az-Zuhair is an old friend of mine. I have two learned friends, Messrs Jacob Gabriel and Arteen, who are willing to represent the Shaikh in the matter if the Shaikh intrusts them with his case. Both of them are relia ble and competent and are as good as any lawyer I can find here. I go even so far as to say that no other lawyer enjoys my perso- confidence as much as they do. They are willing to take up Shaikhs case-, provided he pays them a fee amounting to 5/ of amount of the suit, half the fee to be paid in advance and the other half later if they succeed in winning the case. If the Shaikh agrees to their proposal, they will make a written agreement with him, to be attested by you, on the above lines. I have thought it desirably to mention these facts to you, as you may desire to dis cuss the matter with the Shaikh. My friends are almost sure that they will win the case for the Shaikh. If tney do, I shall have the satisfaction of feeling that I have rendered a service to the Shaikh, and I hope that he will prove more helpful to me in connec tion with the -claims of the Shaikh of Mohammerah. I may add that tne case of Bashiyah which was lodged against the Shaikh by the heirs of Ali Pasha az-Zuhair, is quite different from this case, which relates to the main property called Faadaghiyah. Mr. Gabriel the attorney for the plaintiffs m that suit. may nal the the was With best compliments and kindest regards. Colonel R.H.P. Dickson, C.I.S., Political Agent, KUWAIT I .A. , Yours very sincerelyNote on the circumstances of the sale of Faddaghiyah. Vf; 3 ' ^ 'V The property is about 400 jaribs, and was owned by Awwashah. wife of Ahmad Pasha az-Zuhair. Ahmad Pasha sold it for £60000 under an ordinary Sanaa to the Shaikh of Kuwait. He held no power of attor ney from his wife at the time the sale was effected; but he pro mised that such a power of attorney would be forwarded to Abdul Wahhaj* Pasha al-^irtas to enable the latter to appear before the Tapu Department ana aeclare the validity of the sale as is required bv law. Subsequently, a power of attorney^was sent by Ahmad pasha ' A * - v to Abdul Wahhab Pasha al-&lt;*irtas, but this was notfsigned by Awwashah A A. It was made by Ahmad Pasha az—Zuhair and stated that he nas execu ted it in virtue of a power of attorney which he held from his wife # and which was attested by the Notary Public of Galata. The origi nal of this last-mentioned power of attorney^or its certified copy was not sent to Basrah. Abdul Wahhab Pasha al-qirtas executed a deed of sale in favour of the Shaikh of Kuwait, which was attested by the British Consul at K-uwa-i-t*. War broke out in the meanwnile and the sale was not properly registered in the Tapu Department. Somewhere in 1915-16 the revenue Commissioner, Mr. (how Sir Henry) Do/Sbs oraerea the Tapu Department to register the property in the name of the Shaikh of Kuwait. This was done.

X am worried about all this business, as it all means that Kuwait relations with Iraq are going to get worse, and no one wants this, 3, Whether there is anything in the Shaikh’s contention that Baghdad is behind the attacks on his properties it is difficult to say. He does not talk much with me at present, but one thing I think is certain, he ha© secret sources of information coming in from Bagdad and he gets his Ideas from there. Probably some member or members of the oppo sition party in the Iraq Parliament. 4 # You will X am afraid think me tiresome asking you to read through all the old references on the subject that I have raked up from old files. But 2 hope that you will try and go through them all as they not only throw a very clear light on the purchase transactions connected with the properties but show plainly the sort of atmosphere that existed between Kuwait and the Turks in Basrah in the old days and the methods the latter used - a state of affairs which I fear, we are going to see repeated in their entirety before long. 5 # X saw Shaikh Abdullah as Salim 3 nights ago out at his shaab Estate.

I am wading through the papers about the Fadaghiyeh estates and will do what I can in the matter, but really I am rapidly coming to the conclusion that the Shaikh is an exceed, ingly difficult man to help. Instead of coming to us in the first instance he appeals to us after there have already been extensive judicial proceedings, and it is of course difficult to get judicial proceedings quashed. had he, when this case was first instituted / taken up the line that he could not be sued in the ’Iraq Courts as an independent ruler, or in any case have sought our advice when the suit was first filed, it would certainly have been very much simpler* British authorities, but there is a good deal to be said on the other side, and if any body else takes up a similar line to you, I hope you will not take it altogether lying down. though why this should be regarded as a grievance I cannot imagine. The Shaikh said he would like to sever h|s connec tions with Iraq. I said that I would write enquiring as to whether the Government of India could take over uhe^xine or substitute a wireless, but I pointed out the difficulties. Then after I had written to India the Shaikh himself deliberately delayed everything for six or eight months by It is very easy for Abdullah bin Salim to abuse the One grievance apparently is the telegraph line, entering Lt .Col.H.R.P.Dickson,C.I.S., Political Agent, Kuwait.X entering into some secret negotiations with emissaries ^ certain facilities he would keep on their telegraph line! You cannot do these things with a stroke of the pen, and when the Iraqis turned him down and the Shaikh again appealed to me I at once took up the matter again, but to be told we let him down over this is grossly unfair. Then look at his conduct over the oil. Having first W-ttctd- said that under no circumstances he allow Americans into his territory, he v/rites to Holmes a letter ; which entirely sells the pass and makes things as difficult as he can for us. As regards the blockade I admit we might have done more; on the other hand the Shaikh will not lift a little finger to help himself and refuses to discuss the matter personally with Ibn Saud. It is one thing to help a man but a very different thing to prop up a weakling who absolutely refuses to stand on his own legs or to do anything at all to help one. As regards the date gardens, every encroachment by Iraq has been promptly stopped and, up to the present at any rate, the Shaikh has had no ground of complaint• mail at Basrah on the 16th, getting here on the 17th, or come direct by slow mail, and I should of course be delighted to see you: but I merely suggest it in case you would like a change* If you are coming please send me a wire. entering into some secret negotiations with emissaries ^ Iraq and stated that if the Iraqis were prepared to give him yould you care to come over and stay with me for a few daysl If convenient you could either catch the fast.v£ i 4 V (Air Mai 11 *•. ^ waa- ^ . ) British Hssihency anh Goneulate-tnii»rai, Bushirs, 11th July 19i8. / *&gt; &lt;y.\ Jr Sir, 1 haTtt the honour to forward herewith for Your Bxeelleney’s information copies of two letters with their enclosures received fro» the Political Agent t Kuwait, regarding certain law suite that are being brought against the Shaikh of Kuwait in connection with certain properties on the Shatt-al-Arab. 2* She facts of the case are given in Colonel Dickson’s letter* It will be seen that in respect of the ••Baehiyeh* properties judicial proceedings were instituted some time ago # and the Shaikh was successful in the Court of the First Instance. The case was then taken to Baghdad, where apparently a re-trial of the case was ordered, and at the eeoond trial a decree was given against the shaikh which was upheld by the Baghdad Court. 3. As regards the second case dealing with a portion of the 'Fadaghlyeh' estates, proceedings have not yet co»- meneed, but there sees® no doubt that a suit for the recovery of these properties is about to be brought. Excellent High Cosmic si oner for Iraq, g. h d &gt; A ■4, St 1« unnecessary to trouble Sour ijcoellency with copies of the voluminous correspondence to which Colonel Qlokson refers. St can be suBsasd up very briefly. A perusal of It shoes that these properties were purchased by ahalkh Mubarak, who tried t© get the#* regietered at Basra, but the Turkish authorities refused to register then unless the Simikh described himself as a Turkish subject. This he declined to do and in this attitude rssslvsd our full and constant support, end it is for this reason that the transfer was not registered till 191b, after we had occupied Basra. Kwn then, as will be seen, the transfer of the «Bashiyoh tt property was not registered owing to the illness of the vendor, but the deed of sale bad already been registered at the Basra Consulate . A perusal of the correspondence leaves no doubt in the mind of any impartial person that it was a bona fide transaction ard it is not disputed that the purchase prise was paid, in It has been^the possession of the Bhaikhs of Kuwait for twentythree years and only new is their title disputed. I may mention that Shaikh Mubarak in order to obtain registration proposed to get it registered in the um» of two of his ladies and a blind son, but even this concession to the Turks was die ecu raged by us* 5 . i m entirely unacquainted with the present judicial regime in * Iraq, and do not know whet lie r the Shaikh is in any position to contend that the case should have been heard by one of the British judges, or whether the Indian Law of Limitation applies. A point, however, which does not seem to have been raised during the proceedings is whether the Bhaikh of Kuwait, an independent Ruler, is liable to be sued in the Iraq Courts. In any case I should be most grateful if four excellency would kindly advise ms in this matter and let me know whether there are any further steps that the uhaikh of Kuwait oan take to maintfA: hi*/hie rlj$its» 6 .

I have rarely seen the Shaikh so bitingly sarcastic against us, as he was when he saw the notices. He vehemental^y called God witness that while he knew that we in the gulf were his friends and that Sir Hu$i Biscoe had worked on his behalf till he had killed himself, yet he knew our efforts were all going to be useless as His Majesty’s Government and especially Sir Francis Humphreys were clearly against him. By their faire” attitude, both over the date garcxen taxation Question, and over the disgraceful attacks on his properties, it was certain that he would be beaten, ^or naturally he said if the Iraqis saw no pressure from His Majesty’s Government or her repeesentativo, then 'the mice would go on eating the cheese' (his words), was he said netting ready to return the document promising him exempt- ion from taxation to His Majesty’s Government , as a dishonoured promise. This sort of thing makes things all very difficult for me, as in the oil negotiations now stating with the A.P.O.C . the ohaikh mi^t very easily vent his spleen on the v company. If this should happen it will be due to His Majesty’s The Hon’ble Lt-Col. T.C. &gt;/.Fowls, C.B.B. , Political Resident in the Persian ujl,-,, Honf i dent i o.].

I am quite prepared to go off and do my best. 3ir Hugh had this in mind just before he died, and told me that he had collected all facto and v-ras going to make a grand attack in London. As it is I fear that the High Commissioner with his frequent visits always gets the first say whether in. Let me know/your views on this suggestion of mine are favour able or otherwise. 6 , Regarding the 'coming attack’' on the Fadda- ghiyeh Estate- I have it today on the authority of a very well- known Basrawi notable (I cannot mention his name under promise) that the case is now being prepared by a Basrah Lawyer called 'Sulaiman al Shawaf. This man’s partner is an Ali Hi the , advocate, who works in Baghdad, -Eli Ri 1 ha* s brother is employed by the Ministry of Justice, and his particular pigeon is ^ the Appellate Court. All letters from the Hi^i Commissioner to the Ministry o^ Justice etc. will probably go through this person's hands, or will be seen by him, and he can keep his lawyer orother au fait with all our efforts etc,etc. The inference is clear, that chance has the Shaikh with this sort of thing against him? 7# Another thing will interest you - The same informant toils ne that on Nuri Pasha’s last visit to Basrah he )(/ lead a deputation to complain against the iniquity of the 'Istahlak' law, as it was going to hurt hundreds of nalloko. Nuri Pasha after listening to the deputation, took my informant aside, and told him that the Government had introduced the la- entirely to bring pressure on the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohamnerah who thought they were God’s brotiiers (his wards) hut that the law would, be changed again, as soons as these worthies were brought to'senses. I remember, I once told Sir Hugh Eiscoe that this was my view of the new law, hut he entirely pooh-poohed the suggestion. It seems I was right after all. Yours sincerely,J flflnfidenfrial .

Dear Sir Francis -pared hy Alexander regarding the attempts which have Been made to deprive the Shaikh of Kuwait of certain of his date gardens. I enclose a copy of the letter ask- -ing him for the information. cases, viz.la) The Bashyyah garden case, the claim to 1/10 of which has J^ready 'been admitted hy the Gourts in favour of one of the daughters of the original owner, and (h) The f’addaghiyah case, said to he under prepar- -ation, regarding which no claim has yet been filed. Alexander are that legally the Shaikh has no title to the Bashiyah garden, and he can suggest no steps whereby the Shaikh f s interests therein can he safeguarded, he also expresses the opinion that if the Faddaghiyah case comes to Sourt, the Shaikh will probably lose it. His enquiries do not support the suspicion that the ‘Iraqi G-overnment have any part in a conspiracy to oust the Shaikh from the properties. The Shaikh s difficulties arise solely from the fact that as he was not an Ottoman subject, he could not obtain a clear legal title to these lands, and this is being taken advantage of by unscrupu lous claimants, egged on, no doubt, by sharp lawyers. The fault ijT not having the case heard throughout by a British judge seems to lie with the representative of the Shaikh in ‘Iraq who seems at no time to have applied for the case to be heard by a British Judge. You will remeitber that there were two The general conclusions reached by The memorandum..The memorandum and the cases themselves bristle with legal technicalities, and there do appear to he one or two legal points on which a skilled advocate might build up a case. For the present I can suggest no other course of action than to hold up all legal documents for service on the Shaikh here, until Nihill returns. ^n this way we can prevent any further legal steps being taken to the Shaikh's disadvantage. Gases have been filed by the other three sisters of the success -fuljplaintiff in the ^ashiyah case and these documents are being held up. The reply to Alexander’s letter to the Minis- -ter asking for an enquir# into the reason why the appeal case was not specifically brought to his notice when it came up before the Court of Cassation, will be reported in due course. Sir Hubert Young, who arrives to-day, has not seen these papers, which 1 am sending by this mail in order that they may reach you by the end of the month. I will place them before him as soon as possible. The Shaikh of Kuwait has suggested that he should pay a private and personal visit to Baghdad to see the King, and the Political Resident hints that the the question of his date gardens may be one of the forces which have prompted the request. The King has sent a reply welcoming the visit, which will be for two or three days only, at the beginning of September. Yours sincerely, sd. F. TJ. Stafford •Secretariat of H.E. the *lgh Commissioner for 'Iraq. Baghdad, the 1 st Aug. 1932. D.0.6408. My dear Alexander, fiis Excellency the High Commissioner directs me to forward to you as ^cting Adviser the enclosed copy of a letter from the Political resident in the Persian Gulf regarding difficulties which the Shaikh of Kuwait is encounteiing in connection with litigation arising out of his possession of landed properties in 'Iraq. ^is Excellency will he glad to receive as early as possible a general report on the case referred to, and, in particular, upon the following points:- (a) What is the law of limitation to he applied to these cases? (h) A copy of the plaint and the defence is thes second case regarding the rBashiyah lanas. (c) How was it that the case was not brought to your notice especially in view of the fact that the original case was heard by you? (d) Whether in your opinion the Bhaikh can success -fully contest all these claims under the exis -ting law or whether fresh legislation will be n^sary? His Excellency desires to have the above report sent to him so as to reach him before the end of August if possible. Yours sincerely, Sd/- F.E.Stafford. G.ALEXANDER, Esq., C.B.E.20th August, 1932. MBMOBAMDUM . Subject U) The Shaikh of Kuwait and the Bashiya G-ar&amp;en^land suit. (2} The possession of the ^Fadaghiyah garden lay the Shaikh of Kuwait. A * # Jy% » | 1. With reference to your letter dated 1.8.1932 the rrime Minister and the Minister of Justice have b 'both mentioned this matter to me and requested me to fJxnisu a^l available information. l am therefore in a position to supply you with fuller comments than 1 would feel justified in doing if I acted only on the terms^of Secretary of State*letter dated 6 th February 19 26. 2 * The Prime Minister and the Minister of Justice realise that in your opinion the good name of the Law Courts is involved and at this stage of the political developement of ’Iraq., the Government are particularly desirous that there should not be imputations against the Law Courts and in particular against the Court of Cassation. 3 . I must point out that I occupy the most peculiar position in this matter, for this report does not con- -sist in my giving a note on the whole case only, but the honesty of the personnel of the Court of Cassation is directly challenged by the Shaikh of Kuwait and this aspect has been pressed by you upon me most forcibly, further you have put certain questions as regards the Shaikh's position in Law. I trust I may be able to give you full aibd accurate information on most of these matters but I cannot say what future decisions ought to be given by the courts because I shall I).V. most certain -ly be required to sit. 4 . The letter from Colonel Dickson dated 25.6.32 shews...shews that the Shaikh of Kuwait owns 5 gardens or rather groups of gardens* The two gardens under reference in this matter are the ^ashiya and the Faddaghiya gardens, these two gardens, with a third garden called A 1 Kharam, form the group of gardens called Faddaghiyah vide para.( 9 ) of the letter. The case already decided affects the garden ^ashiya and is in respect of a claim to one tenth of that garden 'being the share claimed hy Rafia Bint Ali Pasha A 1 Zuhair. I have received information that three of the sisters of Rafia have now filed similar eases in the Court of First Instance^asrah, cases Kos. 239, 214 and 253 and the secretariat of the High Commissioner has 'been informed. The Shaikh of Kuwait alleged to Colonel Dickson that a case is about to he filed in respect of the main Faddaghiyah garden hut as regards this no information has reached me. 5. There is a point distinguishing the facts as regards the possession of the Shaikh in the i%shiya garden and the facts regarding his possession of the Faddaghiyah garden vide page (3) of the statement of Abdul ^-ziz el Salim el Badarj^ agent for the Shaikh of huwait^which is attached to Colonel Dickson*s letter. This distinction is that no Tapu Sanad was ever issued to the Shaikh of Kuwait in respect of the Bashiya garden hut it appears that a Tapu Sanad was issued to the Shaikh of Kuwait in respect of the main Faddaghiyah garden vide the letter dated 14.6.1915 from Sir Henry Dobbs and statement on page (7) of Colonel Dickson's letter. This distinction must be borne in mind when I deal with the Shaikh’s possession^ as regards the faddaghiyah garden. 6 I have no knowledge of the conditions under which the other four groups of gardens were bought by the Shaikh of Kuwait nor how the third garden A1 Kharam• • » t A 1 Kharam of the ^'addagtiiyah group was acquired. 7. Without wishing to minimise the importance of the ohaikh*s allegations, the actual case decided affects one tenth of the small garden of 31 jerihs and the Shaikh s main fears is. as regards the large garden of Al Fadaghiyah containing 400 jerihs. 8 . As to the history of the proceedings up to the date of filing the action in the hasrah Court of First Instance in respect of the Bashiya garden, I see no reason not to accept the statement of Aziz el Salim el Badar set out on pages 1 and 2 of the translation of his note and I agree with the statement on page 2 of the letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Sulf dated 11.7.32 that there is no doubt that it was a bona fide transaction and that the purchase price was paid. 9. I will now summarise the case and the findings. This will enable you to follow the complicated series of facts set out in this report. A. sues B. for a declaration of ownership in a piece of Miri land and for an injunction against B. A. proves ownership of her ancestor. B. sets up sale dated 1327 I.e. 13th March 1909 by ancestor of A. to ancestor of 3. by means of ordinary unregistered sale deed. Held this Sanad cannot pass ownership; |a) It has not the consent of the Mamur Tapu neees- -sary in 1327 under section 36 Land -^aw for Miri Land Sales. 4b) The transfer is not registered in Tapu and is therefore void vide r Section 1 .

The history of the proceedings in the Bashiya garden case has not in my opinion been accurately or sufficiently set out, I will therefore try to set out the salient facts. A great deal of stress has been laid hy you and hy Colonel Dickson on the judgement being given hy ’Iraqi and not British judges and I have therefore made several references to this aspect of the case. 41. I have had copies made of the following docu- -ments and they have been sent to your office for Further ess edu the land prior to date of sale because the Sanadtor translation and forwarding to you** 1 * Judgement Court of first Instance dated 15 * 7.31 2 * Judgement Court of Cassation dated 11.11.31 3.

No point turns on this now and it was not raised in the Oourt of Appeal. It merely concerns whether one tenth or the plaintiff inherited/17 out of 215 shares. The thitd ground sets out the case for the defendant namely that his grandfather Shaikh Mubarak Ai Sabah bought the shares belonging to Shafiqa Khanim and her children Hassan, Bahija, Najiya, Bafiya (the plaintiff in the case) and Kamila children of Ali Kasha Al Zuhair for 3033 lira and 30 kurush on behalf of herself as principal and as guardian (wasi) on behalf of the children, as proved by Sanad of sal referred to a condition of sale that if the business of Tafweedh i.e. transfer in Tapu were delayed, that delay would not form any ground to cancel the sale, he then stated that there was a delay in registering due to political matters because the Ottoman Govern- -ment considered that the Shaikh of Kuwait had bought these lands for the benefit of the British Government (sic) vide letter No.504 dated 14.6.1915 from Abdul Aziz Bffendi el Salim el Badar, agent of defendant^ and for this reason the Government of Turkey sent a code telegram to Dafterkhana of Tapu Basra not to tant. On 28.1.1931 the main grounds of defence dated 21st Muharram 1327 The defendant then register Note:Note: I have set out this ground at ^ length because it contains what is the real reason for the delay in registration. On 3.2.1931, plaintiff replied to|this defence , the important points being the following:* (a) So far as the minor children were concerned, no permission was given by the Wadhi. Note: I mention this because the formalities of the sale by the 'Wasi” are given as one of the grounds in-the judgement of Court of First Instance basrah dated 30.12.1931, but this point was not pressed in the Court of Appeal, which decided the case on other points. (b) Proved that this is Miri land and the sale of Miri land without the permission of Mamur of Tapu was not allowed in 1327 under Article 36 of the band Law. (c) That a sale outside Tapu must be registered under Section 1 Law of - L ransfer of Possession of immovable Property Act. The defendant made a rejoinder to this dated 12.2.31 which adds nothing to the matter but on 24.2.31 he filed a petition giving the reasons why the sale was not registered in Tapu. He said that this was not done because the Turkish Covernment wanted a declara tion that the Shaikh of Kuwait was a Turkish subject whereas he is independent unaer the protection of Britain. On the 4th of May 1931 (probably an error for 4.7.31 ) defendant put in letter from Dafterkhana istana to Lafterkhana Basra ordering him to do the registration on the lines jf the communication from the Prime Minister. He also filed a translation of letter from Prime Minister Mahmud Shawkat Pasha to “inistry of Finance x stana ordering it to carry through the business■business of Shaikh of Kuhammera and that of the Qaimmagam of Kuwait if they admit that they were Turkish subjects and agree to have this endorsed in the Sanads. During the hearing on 9.7.31 the plaintiffs filed an^ argument in writing which recap- -itulates the points on which he relies. ^^ Kave set out at length the points made hy plaintiff and defendant because at the rehearing no additional pleadings were filed and the case proceeded on these original proceedings and on the arguments recorded in the , *Dhabt , ‘ i.e. record of the case. You will noticejthat there does not appear to he raised the matter of limitation on which you have laid so much stress hut in fact in the second hearing this point was expressly raised and recorded in the ’•dhaht’* and formed the main grounds of appeal taken in the second appeal. 14. At this stage 1 will set out the dates of the different decisions. They are: 14.4.31 claim dismissed hy Mr.Hooper for lack of prosecution. This is a very ordinary step in a case and I see no reason to comment on the remakks of the defendant’s agent to the effect that at that date, i.e before judgement, Hr. Hooper was convinced of the justice of defendant’s case and for that reason plain- -tiff withdrew her power of attorney from her advocate and allowed the case to he dismissed for default. If Mr. hooper really was unwise enough to shew his intentions before giving final judgement , it is quite understandable why the plaintiff dropped the case hut I really have no grounds on which to say that this was the reason why the plaintiff dropped the case. There may he a dozen reasons. On 6.5.31 the plaintiff applied to continue thecase 'by opposition to the judgement of dismissal. The ca3e was iieard on the 7th of July 1931 hy the Vice-iresident and the judgement was given on 15.^.31, in favour of the defendant , i.e. of the Shaikh of Kuwait dismissing the case on the ground that an action must firstly he filed to cancel the deed of sale of the 21 st Muharram before any action could he filed based on ownership claiming mana’ mu* aradha. So far as the allegation of the ^haikh against the bona fides of the ’Iraqi judges is con- -cerned, 1 cannot see that he can complain of this judgement in his favour but i now draw your attention to fact that although Mr. Hooper was known to be leaving Basrah no application was made to me as Presi- -dent f Court of Cassation^by Mohammed Bffendi Jasfi, the Shaikh's advocate, to transfer the case to another court. It the Shaikh's agent had then any reason to suspect an intrigue either with lawyers or with i Government officials I find it difficult not to sup- -pose that he would have gone to the British Consul and information brought to me or after I went on leave r to Mr.Dower who acted for me. 15. I attach copy of judgement of the Civil Court of First i nstance Basrah which l paraphrase as follows: ' The defendant relies on a contract of sale which purports to transfer ownership to him. The plaintiff relies on inheritance through the person who made the Sanad of Bale. Therefore the plaintiff cannot claim ownership until he has cancelled the sale, she must therefore first file an action to cancel the Sanad. If that suceeeds, she may then claim in respect of the share of the estate which she had inherited as the owner and and may then file an action claiming (Mana* mua* radha ) i.e. prevent the defendant from interfering with 'her property'. For the benefitoenefit of any lairyer v/ho may Tse consulted I should explain that this is what the Turks call a judgement on a preliminary ground. Such judge ments caused much scandalous delay and section 20 of the amended Civil Procedure Regulation was trained to curtail these judgements on preliminary points, hut, unfortunately it left it to the dis- -creticn ot the court and this case is an instance of the trouble which results when a judge does not gi\e judgement on the me^ts as well as on prelimin- -ary objections. IS. Against this judgement as appeal was filed before the Court of appeal C.A.148 of 1931. The Plaintiff appellant: (a) Challenged the correctness of the order of Ids- -missal, (b) referred to section 36 of the Land haw and the Judgement of the Court of Cassation of Con- -stantinople dated 13/1/1331 with reference to the sale made outside Tapu by the Sanad of 21 st Muharram 1327 relied on by defendant respondent. (c)Urged that the sale of the minor* property without ri , leave of the Qadhi is valid. The advocate for defendant respondent maintained that the decision was correct and he also claimed that in view of the long possession of this land the Law of Limitation applies. I was present at the hearing of this appeal. A fairly complete note was prepared for me and I concurred with, the judges. In this judgement the court held that the decision to reject the claim on the single ground that the plaintiff must first file an action to cancel the deed of sale is wrong ,in particular as it will appear clear that this deed is null and void as a transfer of property being made outside Tapu vide sec.l Immovable Property Act and without permission of the Lamur as requiredrequired UDder section 36 of the Land Law and as this transaction was not merely voidable hut is actually null and void, no separate action to can- -cel it is required before the court can treat it as being non-existent. Lhe case was therefore remitted for re-hearing on its merits. As this decision was given by Turkish trained judges and is framed in language which presupposes that the decision is a technical document for lawyers, the following observations will assist you in realising what is the theory of Turkish Law regarding unregis tered sale of Miri land in areas where the Tapu offices function. In Turkey there is a difference between transfer of mulk (firagh) and transfer of miri (tafweedh). In l Miri Lands there is always an ultimate ownership in Government which may be resumed and section 36 of the Land Law preserved the right of Government to interfere with the free disposal of such Miri land hy insisting that the permission of Ma’mur concerned I.E. transfer is legally effected in the Tapu office only, Miri land was registered in Tapu and the consent obtained was null and void in the year 132? and in the eyes of the Law did not exist to pass property. The consent of the Mamur Tapu does not appear to be necessary any longer since 1329 but that dees not concern the efforts to register this sale. ^ 7 , Before going on with the proceedings I wall _ _ a. „ 4 - v. ^ 'K'l r-. r/,t vr* v* £»-Pn a csri 'h r\ VA the Tapu Ma # mur should be obtained. Further such therefore, unless and until, a transaction affecting usually by endorsement ofthe Mamur Tapu, that transactiorever: in the case of Mulk land e.g« houses and small gardens it is only allowed on conffition that the foreigner submitted to the laws and courts of the country and as regards Kiri land it was forbidden. The Turkish attitude in this matter throughout has been that no sale to foreigners will be allowed and the Government Kamur was forbidden to allow this trans- -fer. Under the orders of the Turkish Prime Minister, however, they stretched a point as regards the known attitude of the Shaikhs of Muhammerah and Kuwait towards the Turkish State and offered to allow them to register their sale if they admitted that they were Turkish sub- -jects. The Court of Appeal disposed of the first appeal on the 9th of November 1931, and papers went back to -Basrah and on the 14th of December the * Iraqi Vice- -President fixed the 23rd of December for the rehearing. Since the proceedings in this part of the case have been attacked because no British judge sat, I must point out that Mr. LLoyd was ^resident of the Basrah Court and was in Basrah from 1 st of December. All British judges know that they should sit if possible in foreigners' cases and I cannot believe that any application was made to Mr. L^oyd to sit in this case and must therefore presume that the advocate Muhanned M a sfi Effendi and Abdul Aziz Effendi Ai Salim A 1 Badar took no steps to draw the attention of the British President to the case. I have read the rt dhabt“ and it is quite clear that the following points were raised in argument by the Shaikh of Kuwait’s advocate. (a) That in this case limitation ought to run under section 144 schedule 1 the Indian Dimitation Act and that the period has elapsed. (b) If the Indian Limitation Act does not apply, limi- -tation runs..runs under the Law of the country and also has elapsed. On 30th Decemher 1531 judgement was given in favour of the plaintiff on the following grounds:- (a) That the sale as shown Ly the deed of 21 st Muharram 132? was null and void under section 1 Possession of Land Law. lb) Section 1647 of the Majelie lays down that in view of the admission of the right of the plaintiff’s ancestor no prescription can he pleaded. Fate: This is the important decision as to limitation and will he discussed later on. lc) That at any event a sale hy one H Wasi“ will he invalid. ' 19. On this judgement appeal is made to the Court of Appeal; 2 nd appeal No. 66/932. Iskender -^ansour l Effendi appeared for the Shaikh as appelant. It is alleged that I was deliberately kept in ignorance of this case. -“-skender Mansour is an advocate who often comes to Baghdad on appellate work and is quite well aware that he may at any time have access to the Presi- -dent if he wishes to apply to him. He made no effort to secure my presence in the case. The case was heard on the 9th Lay. There were five cases in the list in- -cluding one concerning a foreigner on which I sat. The parties in the appeal hy the Shaikh of Kuwait were descrihed : Appellant:A1 Shaikh Ahmad A 1 Sahah, Advocate Iskander Effendi Lansour. Respondent: Rafi Bint All Zuhair, her advocate Kamal Effendi A1 Sinawi. I note that you apprehend that this omission to inform me that it was a foreigner’s case was intentional. In view of the extremely sharp* nature of your conjec- -tures I have asked the Minister to hold special enquiry vide my letter vide..CY&gt;3\ vide my letter to the Minister dated 16.8.32, copy attach -ed. I will only observe that the grounds of appeal filed by Iskender Mansour do not state that the Appellant was the Shaikh of Kuwait not does the copy of the judge- iment ot the First Instance filed with those grounds state that-ftuti theitShaikh is described by the title of Kig Highness and the advocate's Power of Attorney state that he was the Ruler of* Kuwait• 20 The judgement of the Court of Cassation sets out the grounds of appeal fully. They are as follows:- (a) Limitation is this case should he in accordance with para.144 Schedule 1 of Indian Limitation A ct, that the period under this is 12 $ears, and that twelve years of actu^l^ possession had passed before Basrah Law Repeal ■^ct of 1920 took effect and appellant claims to prove this by proving possession before the sale deed was made, lb) If Limitation under the Indian Indian Limitation Act is not good then the appellant has been in possession for the necessary period under the law of the country 5 and Section 20 of the -‘-'and Code applied which gives prescription of 10 years. (c) Appellant has enjoyed this possession by virtue of a legal sale not in opposition to the wishes of the seller. Although the sale by the one w Wasi* yet it was with permission of the Qadhi and if the Court cancels sale I ask for the recovery of the price. The plaintiff respondent took the points already dis- -cussed in the L a w Court and in particular laid emphasis on section 1674 of the Majelle claiming that once an admission of the right of plaintiff’s ancestor had been made a defence of limitation cannot succeed and he also relied on section 1 of the Transfer of Immovable Property Law. As to Limitation under the Indian Limitation Act the period runs from date of Sanad 13-2-1909 to 30th Sept. 1920 i.e. eleven years seven months and a half.i half The defendant appellant submitted a further statement of grounds of appeal of which the important points are: - A (a) ihe irossessio’j exceedlnsg 12 years under the Indian Limitation Act. * (D That the Q.adhi had g^ven valid permission. (c) That no permission of Manu Tapu was required. The judgement of the Court of Cassation holds that;- (a) In as much as the Sanad of sale stated that possession of t h esel ^ e^ ^ co n t in u ed up to the date of sale, the possession/for the purpose of Limitation runs from the date of the Sanad i.e. 21 st Muharram 1 327 and that 12 years hag not expired under the Indian Limita- -tion Act before the Basrah Law Hepeal Act. (b) Under the Law of the country the admission of a right to title^ entirely prevents a subsequent set- -ting up of Limitation under section 1674 of the hajelle (c) The sale deed is null and void. I have examined the points of limitation under the Majelle i.e. Law of the country, and there is ample authority from the remarks of Ali Haidar the jurist that if a defendant admits that the origin of his g® possession has derived from the plaintiff or his ances- -tor the defendant cannot plead prescription but must prove some other means of aquisition e.g. sale. In this case he tried to prove such sale but as the sale was unregistered he cannot rely on this as a transfer of property; as long ago as 1318 all such transactions outside Tapu were forbidden regarding Lulk and Liri land by Iradah Saniyah. f -1 21 ...21 . I come to answer your specific questions: (a) to limitation; I have set out the view taken Dy the Court of Cassation and I see no reason to suppose it is wrong except that the view that possession under the Indian Limitation Act only runs from the date of the oanad is a point on which I am a little doubtful; there is however much to 'be said for the view followed by the Court of Cassation that the written admission in the £&gt;anad of sale as to possess!®! commencing with the date of the Sanad is conclusive aganfTst the purchaser even though the Sanad itself as a disposition of property is null and void. A reference to the Sanad shows that it contains admission that the land is under the possession of the seller up to the date of the Sanad and will be possessed by the Shaikh of Kuwait. Cb) cony of olaint_and defense: I have already stated that in the rehearing at ^asrah separate written pleadings were not filed but that the 'dhabt' a court record shews clearly that the point of limitation was argued. I have supplied copies of all pleadings. (c&gt; I have explained how I did not come to sit in this case. (d) See next paragraph. 22. Your question (d) presumably refers to the two gardens Bashiya and Padaghiyah. I do not see what the Shaikh can do to contest the decision already as regards the claim of Bafia to l/10th of the Bashiya garden;, but if he wishes to apply for a review the grounds are well known vide section 27 of the Amended Civil Procedure Regulations. Clearly I cannot possibly advise to his chance of success. As regards the Paddaghiyah garden I remind you of the distinction between this garden and the Bashiya garden; namely,..namely that it appears from the letter of Sir Henry Dohhs sated 14th of June 1915 that a Sanad Kbakani has been issued to the Shaikh of Kuwait. If an action is filed as regards the Faddaghiyah garden the followiing points will certainly arise: (a) Is the Sanad Khaiiani a valid disposition in Tapu? (h) If valid so far as the Government is concerned was it made with the consent of the seller or her heirs? (c) If there were minors with interests in the garden when does the period of prescription cease. I will here observe that Sir Henry Hobbs* letter shews that the entry in the register was made without the consent of the heirs of the sellers.. i&lt;kA*r Under Turkish^it is possible to file suit to declare void a transaction in Tapu and the point will be taken that it is essential that in such transaction the seller or his agent must be present and admit the sale. As regards prescription for such suit I am unable to how far prescription may run as the claimant appears to have been a minor at the time of the sale. If a minor the period of Minority must be added to the period of prescription^ which I am informed is 15 years. ■ L n answer to your question I can therefore say that it is douMful whether the Shaikh can successfully contest the claim, assuming the period of prescription is not com- -pleted. 23. A s regards legislation, this depends on the generalconditions surrounding this case. In this matter the Iraq Government stands in the shoes of the Turkish Government. The same objection to foreigners holding Mird land prevails. The Turkish view is confirmed by the Courts was that this transaction is null and void but the Mamur of Tapu would, on behalf of the Government, allow registration, as the sellers agreed, on condition that the purchaser declared himself to be a Turkish subject. I do not see that any political consideration can possibly destroy the legal results of such failure to register. The Law as to limitation laid down under section 1674 of the Majelle is peculiar to English ideas but to me it seems logical. There have been many different decisions as regards necessity or non*necessity of registering land in different parts of Iraq but I am of the opinion that as far as the transactions in land at Basrah is concerned section 36 of the Land Law certainly applied as to permission of Mamur Tapu and since the Irada Saniyah of 1318 there have been many decisions insisting that asles must be registered or they have no validity. The first part of section 1 of Law to dispose of Immovable Property 1329 lays this down and applies in Iraq according to many decisions. The Unregistered Sales Confirmation Proclamation 1919 affirms this in its pBBamble, 24 . Generally, I am of the opinion that, even if the omission to inform me of the case was intentional, the grounds given by the Court of Cassation will be accepted by the Iraq Government as being valid grounds for determining this claim and unless there is some treaty obligation I do not think that the Iraq Government will admit any liability. The argument may be expressed as follows Minor Children are not bound until they reach majority. They may take any legal steps to recover what they think is their patrimony. The sale by ancestor of plaintixf is nullnull and void. If there is a legal flaw in the title of the purchaser from their father and mother they may recover their estate even though it has enormously increased in value unless they are time barred. They were not time barred at the date of the Basrah Law Repeal Act and under the Civil Law no prescription can be good as the Shaikh admitted that he held his titles from the ancestor of plaintiff. I will put the matter in another way. The Shaikh of Kuwait has induced the British Government to guarantee his possession of lands to which he cannot (presumably) establish his legal title. I draw attention to the following :- It is in fact clear from the conditions of the deed that he was aware of the necwssity of registration and aware that there were difficulties he endeavoured against the express provisions of the Law to ensure that the sale should not be considered null. 25. As to the promise by the British Government, the Iraq Government, so you inform me, don’t admit this promise to be binding on the Iraq Government. If there is a dis- -pute between the two Governments, presumably the matter will go to the Hague Court. If the Hague Court holds that this is an international obligation of Iraq, then, the Iraq Gov- -ernment may have to pass a law expropriating those persons who establish their claims in those gardens. If the Hague Court holds that there is no ihternationai obligation on the Iraq Government it aeems to me that this becomes a matter between the British Government and the Shaikh of Kuwait and it is for the British Government to decide whether the Shaikh should be compensated. 26. I notice that the Shaikh of Kuwait refuses to employ Mr. Mirza Mohammed. It will be extremely difficult for the High Commissioner to get legal opinion unless some advocate of standing is employed and I am of the opinion that it iV s *' y it is advisable to obtain the J 4 a^^e-s of an experienced 10081 advooate - “ “ay be that the fuling on limitation under the Indian Limitation Act can be attacked and the ruUng that under article 20 of the Land Code is subject to the overriding provisions of article 1674 of the Majelle may be challenged by the advocate* 27 ' ’ I ’ he Politi c8l Resident of the Gulf asks about the claim to be independent of the Law Courts. All I can say is that the Shaikh of Kuwait can raise this point in the 3 cases filed at Basrah. When a foreign potentate possesses land in another country it is easy to believe that the Court will not admit that an action affecting immovable property can be excluded from their jurisdiction. 28. ?he Court gave kk no order regarding the point rai^ -ed on appeal that a refund of the purchase price should be claimed. There is nothing to prevent the Shaikh claiming tc recover this. ho doubt the Court did not decide this as it would mean an adjournment for payment of court fees on the claim. 29 * Tile Court did not go into the point whether the second guardian should have joined in the sale. There may be a good deal of substance in the argument that when there are two 'tfasis” both must join, failing which a disposition by one can be upset. 30 * 1 cannot recommend any legislation except to alter the application of the Majelle, to possession of land under article 20 of the Land Code. 31* Finally do not let it be supposed that I am in favour of the present Civil Code known as the Majelle nor of the provisions of the Land Code. I have frequently pressed for the revision of both the Majelle and Land Code anjl you will find my comments in my annual reports especially for 1923, 1924, 1926 and 1931, copies of which should be in your off ice.

There ere of course certain points in favour of the ahaiJth* though tn^y have l&gt;ee» overruled in the tourta. One is that in the case of the Baahlyeh garden, as Ur. Ale^ioiaer points o it (paragraph B ), there is no doubt that its purchase Tsy the shaikh was a bona fide transaction and that the purc•**£*-s© price *•• s paid. The grounds on which the Shaikh seeks to rebut the claim of the plaintiff ares *'(1) Under the Indian Limitation Act# * (2) Under Article 20 of the Land Act, * Paragraph 9 of Mr* Alexander * s note# Under the foraer the Shaikh, by the decision of the Court, le only months short of the necessary tl.ae 11H ye ra;. -he Coutt refused to bear witnesses that tte Shaikh had poeseased the land prior to the date of its sale, on the grounds that the “p« * of Sale on which he himself relied stated that the seller was in possession up to the date of the sals. Presum ably the Shaikh con produce witnesses to prove actual possess ion before the date mentioned in the .ianed of ale, and ar. Alexander (paragraph 21 (*5 ) is doubtful as to whether possMSloa under the Indian limitation Act only runs from the to te of the sanad. He is of opinion (paragraph 26 ) that both that ruling, and the ruling that Article 20 of the hand God# is subject to the overriding provisions of the Aajelle I*., aight be challenged. ££!** &amp;&amp;1&amp; 14 * oula 9 '' i! u *'' ie that both these rulings might well be challenged. e# With re erd to there being no British Judge on the tribunals which tried the csss, Alexand^ says* ' i must point out that Mr. -loud was President of the Basrah Court anu was in '-.rah from 1st of cecsmber. m British Judges know that they should sit if possible i« foreigners' cases «U34O' I ^ ' I cannot believe mat any a plication wae mdde to Mr* i-loyd to sit in mie case and lannt therelore presume that Ui® advocate Eoimmmad -aaf i ^ffendi and ^.bdul Aaia i ffendi hi dalim /X Badar took no otepe to dr a* the attention of the British President to the case** (paragraph IB of Mr*Alexander 9 s note)* Farther in paragraph 19 he say a* M it in alleged that X was deliberately kept m ignorance of this case* Iskander Eanseur is an advocate who often comes to Baghdad on appellate work and ie quite well aware that he may at any time have access to 'the President if km wishes to apply to him* he made no effort to secure jay presence in the ease* The caaeo were heard on the 9th May* There were 5 cacao in the list including one eoneerti ing a foreigner on which I eat* Xh® part lee in the appeal by the Shaikh ef Kuwait were described* Appellant* AX Shaikh Ahead &amp;1 Stibah» Advocate Xekender Mfendi Eanaour* Beepcndenti Kafia feint All **uhair t her advocate CMoaX sffendi AX sinawi* 1 note that you apprehend that this omiealon to inform me that it was a foreigner 1 © case was intentional* In view of tho extremely sharp nature of your conjecture® I have asked the Minieter to hold special enquiry vide mg letter to the Minister dated 16th August 193*2, copy attached* I will only observe that the grounds of appeal filed by Xekender Man sour do not state that the Appellant was the Bh&amp;ikh of Kuwait nor does the copy of the Judgment of the Air at Instance filed wi th those grounds state that tut the Bhaikh is described by the title of His Highness and the advocate’s lower of Attorney state that he was the Ruler of Kuwait.'

Dear Residency, iOth December 1932. Reference the correspondence ending with your letter £io.617-S dated the 27th of August, 1932, regarding the hon- service of certain judicial documents on the Shaikh of Kuwait, these have been returned to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs with an intimation that service could not be effected. We are now sending you a further document for service on the Shaikh. Xou will note that it is a copy of the judgment given by the Court of Appeal in the case of the Bashiyah strip of the Faddaghiyah estate in which the Shaikh’s opponent was Rafi’ah, a daughter of Ali Pasha al Duhair. As the Shaikh was himself the Appellant in the case and thereby recognised the jurisdiction, he will presumably raise no objection to accepting service of this decree. If you agree perhaps you will be good enough to forward the document to the Agency at Kuwai t. We should explain why this document sent to us in August is only being sent on to you now. At the time it seemed better to hold up all judicial documents sent us for service on the Shaikh whilst the problem of these land cases was under discussion. As, however, service of this particular document can have no effect prejudicial to the shaikh’s interests, we can see no harm in forwarding it.

The suit in question concerns a portion of the Shaikh’s Faddaghiya estate on Shatt al-Arab, and the Bashiya land to which members of al-Zuhair family lay claim to. The Secretariat of the High Commissioner for Iraq passes the case to the Political Agent, Kuwait, upon the request of the Iraq Ministry of Justice. In turn, the Political Agent passes the case to the Shaikh of Kuwait and to the Political Resident, Bushire.The correspondence includes a report (ff 26-50) with full details related to the Shaikh’s Faddaghiya estate in Iraq, accompanied by two attachments. The first attachment includes communications with Abdul Aziz al-Salim Al-Badr, the Shaikh’s agent in Basra who provided the Agency with details of the way by which Faddaghiya estate had been bought by Shaikh Mubarak in 1908. The second attachment includes the correspondence with Mirza Muhammad, agent in Iraq to Shaikh Khaz'al, recommending two lawyers, Messrs Jacob Gabriel and Arteen, to help the Shaikh with the case. The Political Agent, Kuwait, also sent two short histories of the Bashiya and Faddaghiya estates (ff 88-96) to the Political Resident, Bushire. According to the reports, the Faddaghiya estate was owned by Aisha, wife of Ahmad Pasha Al-Zuhair. Ahmad Pasha sold the estate to Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait although he did not hold a Power of Attorney from his wife at the time of the sale.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="family"><namePart>al-Zuhair (Family)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Shatt al-Arab</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Estates (land)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Suit of court</topic></subject><subject><topic>Power of attorney</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Hakim of Kuwait Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Hakim of Kuwait Mubārak bin Ṣabāḥ Āl Ṣabāḥ</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Date Gardens</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000057#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
