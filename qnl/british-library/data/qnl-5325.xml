Dear Bahrein A German business man named Heinrich Willnow has come to ue in great distress because he has been told (he says ) by his diplomatic representative here that he is suspected of having indulged in espionage at Bahrein. His passport bears a visa,for Bahrein, No.47 of July 4, 1934, granted by the British Consulate at Bremen. He is now on his way back to Germany, but will be coming out to these parts again before long on his firm’s business, and is anxious to have the matter cleared up* Would you let us know whether you have anything against him?

Herr vilJnow was at first prevented from landing here in December 1928, as Ills Excellency the Shaikh did not desire Germans to visit the islands, owing to the undesirable activities of ESessrs sronckhaus and Company during the early days of the war. Later, Herr Villnow was permitted to land, on the express understanding that he came for business [| t purposes only. 3.

I hare the honour to enclose a copy of a note by £*• Acting Vice-Consul L.P.L.iyraan containing certain information about the activities of the Hansa Line in the Persian Gulf, which has come to hia ears in the course of conversation with the various local shipping agents • 2. The Hans a Line’s endeavour to negotiate a contract for grain reminds one of the German activities in this business before the European ?nr 1914-1919 (see, for example, the enclosures to a letter dated the 14th November 1911 from the Board of Trade to the Foreign Office). 3. In April 1936 (see paragraph 47 of Bahrain Intelligence Report Ho.6 for the period April 1st to 16th 1936) the H&amp;nsa Line agent in Bushire (Herr H.I.Pritae) and the Line’s Manager for the Persian Gulf area (Herr Frits Bruhn of Bremen) visited Bahrain on board one of the Hansa Line ships, which had brought material for the Bahrain Petroleum Company. 4. In a recent conversation withae the new Hansa Line agent at Bushire (Herr Johann-Hinrich Plate) snowed considerable interest in Bahrain and rather hinted that he would like to visit the place. I am inclined to think that the ^nsa Line (who are now represented tnere by tne Mesopo tamia /&lt; - 2 - Mesopotamia Persia Corporation) may contemplate trying to open an agency at Bahrain. 5. Xarly this year in the case of a Japanese representative of the Mitsui Bussan Kaisha Limited (eee paragraph 31 of the Bahrain Intelligence Report tfo.4 for the period 16th February to 15th March 1936) the Bahrain Oovermient took up the attitude that, while they were willing to permit new steamer agencies to be given to the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation (who have oeen long established in Bahrain and are a ell skill in the land** ing business), they wished to refuse to permit agencies to be given in future to any other firms who were not Arabs of Bahrain. 6. it seems undesirable that a German Line should open an agency with a German staff at Bahrain and so obtain a foothold at the heart of the Arab Littoral, and I would propose that, if the Bahrain Government are approached, they should reply that, though they are quite prepared to allow the Hansa Line agency to remain, as it is now, in the hands of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, they would not otherwise grant permission for anyone except a suitable Bahrain Arab firm to hold the agency. 7. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Poreign Secretary to the Government of India, Hia Majesty’s Chargfe d*Affaires, Tenran^ the Senior Haval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, and tne Political Agent, Bahrain, and a copy of Mr. pyman’a note to Hie Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Khorremshahr.

It remains to be seen if this firm will be able to maintain its policy against the interests of the Oil Company which dislikes exposing its material to the risks of breakage during transhipment. (c) . The service is likely in any case to hit the British India steam Navigation Company's export trade in dates, gum and other Gulf produce, sent to Bombay for transhipment to the United states* II. /jpcport of Grain from Iran to Germany. The Hansa Line and the Iranian authorities havs been negotiating a contract whereby the latter would ship about 3000 tons of grain a month from Bandar Shahpour by U&amp;nsa ships, and it appeared the deal was going through, when the Iranian authorities suddenly gave up the idea of a monthly forward contract, and told the Company that they would accumulate grain at Bandar Shahpour and ask for a ship when they wanted one. They were probably influenced in their decision by anxiety as to the future trend of world prices and a* to next year’s harvest (this year’s (1936) was exceptionally plentiful), and possibly by doubts as to the ability /~fri|IT * 3 ° © - 2 - ability of tht railway to deliTer supplies according to schedule. The new arrangement appears to give less of a stranglehold on grain exports to the Hansa Line* and as t ne Iranian demand for shipping facilities is likely to be erratic and, from the Yiew point of the Hansa Line, unpredictable, there may be some dissatisfaction on both sides. In any case the first attempt to use Bandar Shahpour for the export trade will be interesting to wa-ch. Some of the Hansa ships on the Persian Gulf serrioe are running with three engineers instead of four, as the demand for engineers for the Nary is causing a shortage. sd« L.j'.L.-yman.HO.C/537-1G/6.

The Secretary to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, jOL c h j; r ^CTIVITILL Hi Th, , P- ru.,1,GULF . Sir, With reference to my letter Ko.749-S dated the 11th October 1936 (written when Officiating Political Resident) about the activities of the Hansa Line in the Persian Gulf, I have the honour to forward the following information about Herr neinhurd Kulenkarapff, who visited Bahrain recently in connection with the shell trade. 2. On the 9th November 1936, Herr Reinhard Kulenkampff, German subject, arrived in Banrain on board the British India ' Steam Navigation Company^ down rm.il. He had a visa granted after reference to me by the British Passport Officer, Berlin, who had telegraphed;- 'May I grant visa Reihhard Kuienicanpff German visit of two weeks on mother of pearl business recommended”. 3. Viiile at Bahrain Herr Kulenkampff stayed with the Agents of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited to whom he had apparently been given an introduction by Mr. Charles Wills of Messrs Gray Dawes, London. He seems to have some business connection (possibly only over shipping shells) with the Hansa Line. He is thought locally to Know all about the shell trade? - 2 shell treble and is said to have bought at cheaper rates than Mr. Sol Pack v/ho sent an experimental shipment to France. So far us I know at present, he did nothing suspicious while in Bahrain. 4. He called on me at the Agency and asked for a visa to go by air to Sharjah for the purpose of buying pearl shells. I explained that visas were not usually given for places such as Uiurjan us t lere were difficulties about protection. He at once volunteered (and subseauently gave it to me in writing) that he would not leave the Airways Station, but would get his friends to do business with him there. I hardly thought that it was possible to refuse this modified request (though it was for the Superintendent to say whether he would allow business to be transacted ut his Station) and 1 also considered that it was better to help him by giving him &amp; certificate of identity rat ier than risk any embarrassing result, when and if my visa on his passport were to get him into trouble in Tr».n. 5. As Herr Kulenkumpff stated that his subsequent intention was to proceed to Persia, no visa for Shar.lah was entered on his passport, but a Certificate of Identity was given to him (with a visa charged for at the rate applicable to German subjects) on tne condition of Ms remaining in the Airways Station for the whole period of Ms stay. 6* Herr Kulenhanpff had an introduction from his firm to one Hais Hassan of lubai, who is a Persian subject and agent for the Hansa Line at Dubai. Hais Hassan is suspected 4 of dabbling in tne sale of arms and ammuMtion, but I have, as yet, no reason to connect Herr Kuienkampff with this traffic. 7. Herr Kulenkampff also asked for help to ehable him to obtain accommodation in Muscat (he appeared to be rather particular about his personal comforts), but was told that m apart froms © apart from the Political Agent and the Arabian Mission there were no Europeans there* After the usual reierence to the Political Agent, a visa for Muscat v/as given to him also on a certificate of identity# 8# Herr Kulenkumpff then got an introduction to the personnel of the Mission at IMscat from their confreres in Bahrain and I understand hoped to arrange for accommodation with Doctor Harrison. 3. Herr Kulenkumpff left Bahrain for Dingsh on tne slow mull of the 17th November with the intention of proceeding from there to ttiscat# I had tola him that the fact that his passport hud a visa for Bahrain might lead to his having trouble with the Iranians at binguh. I have since learnt that he lightly glued together the two pages of his passport which bore the offending name and so eluded Iranian wrath# 10# i am sending a copy of this letter to the Political Agent, Muscat. \ I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant.

I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with your rxpress letter No.910-S dated the 21st December 1936 to the Secretary of State for India about German activities in the Persian Gulf. 2. In paragraph 122(ii) of my Intelligence Report No.17 of 1936 I mentioned that Shaikh Muhammad bin 1 Isa had told me of his visit to Berlin. I gather that he entertained the 'German Oriental Association 1 ( I do not know if that is the correct name)• Shaikh Muhammad recentiy received a telegram from the* Oriental Association giving him a wave length and time to listen in to broadcasting on the night of the 21st December. He was away hawking, but the broadcast in Arabic was picked up here and as far as could be made out was siiLply thanking him for his kindness to the Association *.nd hoping that he had had a good journey home. It is possible that the broadcast is genuinely a courtesy, but I cannot help thinking that it may be designed to cement friendly German relations with one of the ruling family of Bahrain. In this\ © In this connection I would refer also to njy letter ~o.C/109-l./25 dated the 17th February about the possible influence of broadcasting in this part of the world 3.
