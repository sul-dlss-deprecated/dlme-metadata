Uatar: Telegraphic Communications Thank you for your letter dated 11th September, 1946, and accompanying copy of a letter dated 5th September from Petroleum Concessions Limited. The suggestion for telegraphic communications with Qatar was originated by the British Resident, Persian Gulf, and I assume that from his point of view it might be advantageous even thiDugh Petroleum Concessions Limited do not appear to think there would be much advantage to them# In the circumstances I think Petroleum Concessions Limited might now be asked to discuss the matter with Cable and Wireless Limited. To save time, and as I am going to Moscow on Wednesday, perhaps you would write to Cable and Wireless Limited direct. E.P. Donaldson, Esq., India Office.In May last the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was of the opinion that the time was ripe for re-opening the question of establishing telegraphic ccramnications in Qatar and that the Sheik was unlikely to raise any objections* Before approaching Cable and Y/ireless Limited we thought it advisable to consult Petroleum Concessions Limited who would be the party mainly interested and obviously the chief beneficiaries under any system of telegraphic communications in Qatar* The Conmonwealth Communications Council after consulting Cable and Wireless were also of the same opinion and advised us to write to Petroleum Concessions Limited asking them hew far they would be interested in this development. Our letter to Petroleum Concessions ■Limited accordingly issued in these terns. We also suggested that if they wished to pursue the matter the best thing would be for them and Cable and Wireless to consider it jointly and submit agreed proposals to H*U»G» A reply from Petroleum Concessions limited has now been received and is placed immediately below. The theme of their song is that they do not wish to pursue the mattezy as they consider that their present arrangements for caammication through Bahrein are adequate and from their own point of view they see little advantage in our proposal* There does not seem to be any particular urgency in this matter but before replying to Petroleum Concessions limited we might, if you deem it advisable, acquaint the Coraraonwealth Communications Council with the result of our approach to Petroleum Concessions* I propose sending the draft below to the Commonwealth Communications Council* 1■I mm (1! -Ext. 6107/46 INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, LONDON, S.W.I. ff September, 1946.

That is to say, it is difficult to see what advantages there would be from our point of view in such an arrangement as you suggest. •Perhaps you would be kind enough to let us know, before proceeding any further, how this aspect of the matter strikes you.

If the Petroleum Concessions Limited reply in the affirmative I suggest that we should then invite Cable and Wireless Limnted to contact them.

The Secretary, Commonwealth Communications Council, Halifax House, Strand, W.C. 2. Dear Sir, We refer to your letter P.416 of 25 th June, relating to the proposed establishment of telegraphic communication in Qatar. We have been in communication with our Divisional Manager in the Persian Gulf and have ascertained that between 1935 and 1942 our Bahrein wireless station was in telegraphic communication intermittently with Dohah (Qatar), a service which was undertaken at the request of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. This service was discontinued in December 1942. In March 1944 at the request of Petroleum Concessions Ltd. it was arranged for Bahrein to exchange radiotelephone calls with their launch when visiting the Trucial Coast and Qatar. In order to assist Petroleum Concessions, the above mentioned telephone service was extended occas^lanally # to Dukhan (Qatar). We are informed that Petroleum Concessions much appreciated the service furnished and are likely to request this Company to make the service permanent. Before we discuss further the establishment by the Company of a wireless telegraph station in Qatar, we think that it would be advantageous to ascertain the status of Petroleum Concessions as regards telecommunications in Qatar. We are informed that the terms of their Concession in Qatar, Petroleum Concessions ‘’may construct, maintain,and operate telegraph and telephone installations and their lines and wireless station s”. Further, we are advised that they will normally maintain a wireless transmitter and a receiving set at their main camp, apart from radiotelephone communication with launches at sea. In view of the above, v/e should be glad if you would •kindly let us know if you wish us to contact Petroleum | Concessions Ltd., on the subject and if the Political | Resident in the Persian Gulf could furnish this Company with some information of conditions, business activities, and possibilities of obtaining telegraph traffic in Qatar. Also whether accommodation would be available for the staff and offices at any point in Qatar where it would beconsidered desirable that a wireless installation should be established. Yours truly.
