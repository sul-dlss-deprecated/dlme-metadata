Sir 9 i 36 Co i JUt | 1934 J With reference to your despatch No. 190 oi the 14th April regarding the control of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf, I have to Infora you that the Persian ChargS d’Affaires raised this question in the course of recent conversations at the Foreign Office, M» Shayesteh stated that the Persian Delegation at Geneva had heen authorised to eafcark on discussions v?lth the United Kingdom Delegation, and he requested that corresponding Instructions should he despatched to the latter. 2o M. Shayesteh could give no indication of the basis on which the Pero5 J an Delegation had been authorised to discuss the matter, and he had evidently hut little idea of the past history of this question. He was unaware of the existence of tho Persian note of the 10th April, a copy of which was enclosed in your despatch No.190 of 14th April, and when shown it, could give no satisfactory explanation of its purport. 5o XL was explained to Shayesteh that no reply had ever been received to my note of the 3rd June, 1933, to his predecessor. The proposals contained therein hed been intended to go as far as possible to meet the desiderata of the Persian Government, and had beeei evolved with considerable difficulty cold after much Interdepartmental discusslonj they nad been based on Teyuiourtache f s original project for a bilateral convention ea revWed by &amp;.

Vet the Persian Government, without so much as a reference to my note, which had regained unanswered lor nearly a year, had now M withdrawn' Teymourtache*s project which had been the basis of the whole subsequent discussion. the whole attitude of the Persian Government towards this question was, in fact, entirely obscure and difficult to reconcile with ordinary diplomatic procedure, and it was impossible, ixi cue it circumstances to issue any useful instructions t© the United Kingdom Delegation. 4 C M. Shayesteh eventually undertook to point out these facts to his Government, and to inform them, In particular, that until ay note of the $r&amp; tftme, 1935, had received an adequate official reply, ais majesty s Government mmld be unable to take any steps in the matter. 5.

[E 7114/114/34] ^“ November 21, 1933. O '1 If &gt; 4 O Section 8 . No. 1. Mr. Mallet to Sir John Simon.—(Received November 21.) (No. 505.) gi r? Tehran. October 30, 1933. IN paragraph 5 of his note of the 21st October about the search of a Koweiti dhow, the Fath-ul-Khair. near Bushire, on the 21st May, the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated :— “ Without entering into details or mentioning special instances, I imagine that the question of the inspection of suspected dhows by the vessels of the Imperial Government should not cause any anxiety to you because these measures would effectively enhance the safety of the Persian Gulf, to which His Majesty’s Government attach the utmost importance.' 2. This contention, or rather the principle which underlies it, is completely at variance with the attitude which the Persian Government have themselves adopted towards the International Arms Traffic Convention of 1925 and the Slave Traffic Convention of 1882. In the various discussions that have ranged round these instruments and their projected successors, the attitude of Persia has been, roughly speaking, that she would not consent to the search of Persian vessels on the high seas by foreign warships even in return for the right to have the vessels of other countries searched by her own warships. As an alternative, the Persian Government appear ready to enter into engagements respecting both the slave and the arms traffic in which they bind themselves in effect not to search the vessels of other countries for slaves or arms upon the high seas, on the under standing that Persian warships alone shall search Persian vessels. Though such an arrangement would have its disadvantages, it woukT possess one compensating 7 advantage of importance in that Persian warships would be precluded from searching Arab vessels, a proceeding to which His Majesty’s Government could only consent with the very greatest reluctance. 3. In the present case, the principle which the Persian Government are trying to enunciate is obscured, first, by their refusal to recognise the Arab principalities of the Persian Gulf, and, secondly, by their claim to a limit of 7 miles for territorial waters. But the obsession about smuggling is at present so strong among Persian officers and officials of all kinds that I think it highly probable that the Persian Government will continue to search Arab vessels for contraband upon the high seas even if they come to recognise the various principalities and even where the question of the extent of territorial waters is immaterial—unless, of course, some means are devised to stop them. It may, at any rate, be useful to review the position on the assumption that the Persian Government will maintain this principle in the widest sense and defend it on the ground that necessity demands it. 4. It is not my purpose to consider here what I may call general political measures, which might have to be taken if the Persian Government were defiant. Apart from these there arc certain particular measures of a kind in which the punishment may be said upon the whole to fit the crime. The most effective and most legitimate would be for the Persian navy to be shadowed by British warships; but this would be a very costly and inconvenient proceeding. Moreover, in view of the existence of many small customs-launches besides the larger vessels, it would doubtless be very difficult. Other possibilities would be for British warships to search occasional Persian vessels under the convention of 1882 on the so-called Arms Traffic “ Firman ” of 1897 (though the Persian Government could cancel this as easily as the Sultan of Muscat could cancel his Arms Proclamation of 1898), or even on the general principle which the Persian Government have themselves just enunciated. Such action would have the merit of bringing to a head any dispute which might then be raging, but would have to [971 x—8]* be taken with great discretion; for example, it would be necessary in each case to be able to give a plausible excuse for supposing that the vessel which was searched might have been carrying arms or slaves or contraband. 5. Apart from political measures, it is necessary to give consideration to the treaty position. So long as the Persian Government do not renounce theii /- _ intention of searching foreign vessels for contraband on the high seas, either in t specific agreement or by acknowledging that to do so is contrary to international law, there appears to be no particular point in entering into either the proposed j Slave Trade Protocol or the proposed Bilateral Arms Traffic Agreement. The effect of each would be to restrict the powers of His Majesty’s Government in regard to Persian vessels (if indeed they can, from a legal point of view, be more restricted than they are at present), while leaving the Persian Government free, in their own eyes, to search foreign vessels for contraband, or for arms or slaves under cover of a search for contraband. 6. It seems to me that it would be necessary to deal with this point somehow. One way would be to add to the Slave Trade Protocol an article (to come between articles 3 and 4 in the present draft) somewhat on the following lines :— c ‘ II reste egalement entendu que les stipulations de 1’article 2 du present protocole s’dtendent aux vaisseaux qui seront suspects de d£lits de toute autre espece,” a similar article being inserted in the Bilateral Arms Traffic Agreement. No one would be bound, or feel himself bound, by such a provision to refrain from interference in the case of grave offences such as piracy being detected flagrante delicto. 7. Finally, it cannot be denied that a considerable amount of smuggling is taking place into Persia as the inevitable result of the restrictions imposed by the Persian Government upon imports. Lieutenant-Colonel Dickson’s most interesting memorandum upon the subject (see Bushire despatch, dated the 8th June, 1933, addressed to His Majesty’s Ambassador, Bagdad) suggests that in the case of Koweit, at any rate, the people of the place do not themselves carry the contraband goods across the sea, while it is significant that of all the Koweiti dhows which the Persian authorities have so far inspected, only one (the one taken in the Shatt-el-Arab last December) has been claimed by them to have had contraband on board. I have no information as to the position in the other principalities, but even if the position is analogous to that in Koweit, I fancy that contraband is shipped to Persia from most of them and that the inhabitants of all of them participate sometimes in its transport by sea. It seems to me that if ever Persia were to behave properly, it would be difficult to turn down out of hand a request for co-operation in the suppression of the traffic. But how far this co-operation could be given without ruining the Arab principalities, and how far it would be possible in practice to exercise any effective control over the traffic, are matters upon which I have no data for forming an opinion. 8. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire (No. 187). I have, &amp;c. V. A. L.

Please see the previous submission at P.Z.4821/34. ^The reply to the latest Persian proposals for a bi-lateral convention has been held up by the necessity for prolonged correspondence between the F.O. and the Admiralty. The latter held that since the reply proposed by /F.O.^basing our refusal of the Persian proposals on the reluctance of Persia to recognise the position of the Arab States and Rulers of the Persian Gulf would be directed only to the j supervision by the Persian Navy of the vessels of third parties, it would prejudice the position of H.M.G. in replying to the Persians if the latter reverted to their previous proposals of April 1933 under which the Persian Navy would receive the right to verify the British Flag in returnreturn for granting the right to verify the Persian Flag, leaving the supervision of third parties entirely to the Royal Navy. It was of course decided hy the Cabinet in May 1933, as the Admiralty have pointed out, that there could be no question of extending reciprocally to Persian ships the right to verify the Flag of British Indian vessels. The F.O. however consider that it is most improbable that the Persian Government would now in any circumstances revert to their proposals of April 1933, and they have made it clear in the course of^correspondence that, even in the event of this happening, the position would be precisely the same as it was when we replied to these proposals in June 1933, and that H.M.G. would notin any way be precluded from maintaining the condition regarding the non-reciprocal right of flag verification which they attachafto their acceptance of the previous Persian proposals if the latter should now be reverted to. It will be seen from the correspondence at P.Z.6908/34 that in view of this the F.O. have now replied to the latest Persian proposals on the lines originally suggested and concurred in by this Office at P.Z.4821/34.

I said we would await their decision on this; as that we should, I thought, see/strong objection to the verification of the flag of British-Indian vessels as the Admiralty would to that of the verification of the British flag; but that if the Foreign Office could establish the points referred to in the preceding paragraph it might be unnecessary to go too closely into this question^ ^S.*44y8/I&gt;t.IXI/S.«. c&lt;uf- August, 1934 Sir, ,» ■i 1 am co iraanded! by the Air Council to refer to str* Honda 1*« lot tor of tfco 20th July (E« 40X6/2956/94) rogord- ing the Foreign CoTormaont's attitude tovarda the question of areas traffic control in the Foroian Gulf, and to say that, in the eirouajotanoco explained therein, they agree that the draft bilateral convent ion should not be accepted by Hie ttajeety’e Governaent and that this refusal should be baaed on the arguasmt set out in paragraph 4* a.

In replj I am directed to observe that since the reply proposed In your letter would be directed only to the supervision by the Persian Havy of the vessels of third parties, it would remain open to the Persian rrovernrnent to suggest an alternative arrangement in which they would receive the right to verify the British Flag in return for granting the right to verify the Persian Flag, leaving the supervision of third psrtiea entirely to the Royal tfavy. -luce the Persian Gtovemraent were originally prepared to content themselves with the supervision of Persian whipping it would appear to Their lordships that it is by no means unlikely that they would follow this course. Their lordships have always understood that such a proposal would be unacceptable to the Government of T ndia The/ would also point out that the cabinet Conclusion of 26th May, 1933, laid down that there could be no question of extend lag reciprocally to Persian ships the right to verify the Flag of British Indian as well as Arab vessels.

MARKER, Ihe Under beoretary of State, *orei t .» Office, lest minster. 5 . • 1 .Minute Paper, political Department It will be remembered that consiaerable discussion took place last year consequent on a Persian proposal for a bilateral Arms Traffic Convention with this country. The history of this question and the principal points then unaer discussion are examined in the Foreign Office Memorandum to tne Cabinet of the 23rd May 1933, C.P.136/33, on the file. The Cabinet subsequently decided that it was essential tnat we should retain the right to verify the flag of vessels which might be falsely flying tne Persian flag, ana tne reply ultimately sent to the Persian Charge d*Af faires'w (P.Z.3368/33) proceeded on this basis. ' 2. No reply was received- from Persia to our Note of 3rd June last year until 10th April 1934, when the Persian Government informed Sir R. Hoare officially that as the proposals put forward by the Persian Minister in Switzerland to Sir Jonn Simon in May of 1933 had not been accepted in their entirety now and H.M.G. had made counter propositions they must/be regarded as wholly withdrawn. In June of this year the Persians again revived with sir John Simon at Geneva the proposal for a bilateral convention for the control of arms traffic in the Persian Gulf. The text of the draft proposed by them was at about the same time communicated to H.M. Minister at Tehran and to the Foreign Office. 3. The Persian proposals are examined in the Foreign Office letter of 25th July below. They iInvolve reciproca .1 rights of verification of flag by the nigh Contracting Parties and further give both High Contracting Parties the right to verify the flag 2621 6000 3/34 etc.- - 2 - etc. of all third party shipping helow 500 tons in the Gulf area. This would place the dhows of our u rah protegees at the mercy of tne Persians and, as the Foreign office agree, there can he no question of acceding to any such proposal. 4 . The question for decision in these circumstances is that of the tactics to he adopted in rejecting the Persian proposal. The alternatives are: (a) to reply that our Note of 3rd June 1933 which embodied considerable concessions from the Persian point of view, represented tne farthest point to which we could go; that Persia had not only shewn no appreciation of the advance which that Note constituted, hut had now come forward with quite different proposals which we could not regard as acceptable; (h) the course suggested in para.5 of the Foreign Office letter, viz. to base our refusal on the reluctance of Persia to recognise the position of the Arab States and Rulers of the Persian Gulf. On the whole I think; that, for the reasons given in their letter, the Foreign Office are right in preferring the second of the above courses, the adoption of which would, as they remark, leave us on strong ground internationally. A mere repetition on our part that the conditions put forward by us last year, which were primarily designed to secure the sole right of verification of flag for H.M. Ships, were essential and could in no way be modified, might place Persia in a position to put us at a disadvantage with public opinion at Geneva, and indeed generally. 6.

Foreign Office, S.W.l. 20th July, 1934. Sir, With reference to Foreign Office letter No.E 3773/2956/34 of the lith June, I am directed hy Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit to you herewith, to he laid before Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, the accompanying copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran regarding the Persian Government’s attitude towards the question of arms traffic control in the Persian Gulf. A copy of the draft bilateral convention enclosed in that despatch has also been received from the Persian Charge d’Affaires. 2. It will be observed that this draft differs widely, in certain important respects, from the proposals of His Majesty’s Government as communicated to M. Shayesteh*s predecessor in the Secretary of State’s note of 3rd June, 1933 of which a copy fvas enclosed in Foreign Office letter fz-siis-. E 2924/211/34 of 10th June of that year. Not only would the present Persian draft, by Article 2, confer on Persian v/arships the right to verify the flag flo-wn by British and Indian ships of less than 500 tons on the High Seas of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; but it will be seen that the Persian Government have now apparently The Under-Secretary of State, India Office. COPY SENT i withdrawn 30 MT TO- 26 JUL DEPT IN(i? ■ withdrawn their original proposal that the supervision, in the two Gulfs, of all shipping not flying the Persian flag should he entrusted to the British naval authorities (see the second sentence of paragraph 2 of Sir John Simon f s note of 3rd June, 1933), and that they now propose instead, under Article 3 of their draft, that the British and Persian Navies should enjoy equal rights in regard to the shipping of third parties. 3. In Sir John Simon’s view, which was frequently expressed hy the Foreign Office representatives when the matter was under discussion last year, if His Majesty’s Government are to claim the right for British ships to verify the flying of the Persian flag, it would he difficult, from the international point of view, for His Majesty’s Government to defend their refusal to agree to the Persian Navy being granted the reciprocal right to verify the flying of the British or Indian flag. Such a refusal, however disguised, would clearly he based on the premise that, v/hile His Majesty’s ships could always he trusted not to interfere with Persian shipping without good cause, the Persian navy could in no circumstances he trusted not to abuse any such rights which might he conferred on it hy the Convention. The Persians could scarcely acquiesce in such an assumption. But if His Majesty’s Government merely refuse to consider the present Persian proposals without giving any clear and convincing reason for their refusal, the Persians will assume that the refusal of His Majesty’s Government is due to their unwillingness to treat the Persian Government on a basis of equality in this matter. SuchSuch an attitude would he greatly resented hy the Persian Government and might even he regarded as action of a +aJ£ of t} ie Committee of Imperial Defence that it was desirable Government were to refuse to consider the nresent Persian * proposals without giving any clear reason for their refusal, the effect might well he to increase the sympathy, already evinced among certain Governments represented at the Disarmament Conference, with the attitude of the Persian Government towards the relevant provisions of the 1925 convention. 4. On the other hand, the withdrawal of the original Persian proposal, as put forward hy M. Sepahhodi in April 1933, under which the supervision of vessels flying the flags of third parties should he left solely to His Majesty T s Government - i.e. the withdrawal of the original Persian offer voluntarily to renounce any claim to interfere with non-Persian shipping in the two Gulfs - alters the whole basis of the original scheme discussed last year, and seems likely to give rise to difficulties of a different and more serious character, where His Majesty’s Government appear to he on much stronger ground. On this point it could reasonably he explained to the Persian Government that, as was made clear to M. Sepahhodi last year, the crux of this question is the supervision of the shipping of third parties. The PersianPersian Government’s original proposal, which left this to the British naval authorities, would have led to no serious difficulties. But the fact that the Persians now apparently wish to withdraw this proposal, and now claim an equal right with His Majesty’s Government to supervise such shipping, has changed the Basis on which the discussion has hitherto proceeded, and raises the whole question of the relations of the Persian Government with the various Arab States and Rulers of the Persian Gulf. It will be remembered that the Persian Government have repeatedly declined to recognise the Arab States of the Persian Gulf or to abandon the Persian claims to certain of the territories of these Rulers. They have further refused to recognise the special treaty relations existing between His Majesty’s Government and those Rulers. In these circumstances the Arab Rulers concerned could hardly be expected to accept a situation where their shipping would be subject to interference by the Naval authorities of a Power which has adopted and maintained such an attitude towards them, and His Majesty’s Government could not advise them to do so. 5. Sir John Simon considers that if, as he assumes, the present Persian proposal is to be regarded as entirely inacceptable, it will be preferable to base the refusal of His Majesty’s Government to consider it on the reasons given in the immediately preceding paragraph, where His Majesty’s Government are on strong ground internationally, rather than to state merely that the conditions put forward by His Majesty’s Government last year - which were for the most part designed to secure for His Majesty’s ships the sole right to verify the flying of a flag - are essential and can&lt;3 can in no way be modified. 6. The Persian Charge d f Affaires has now expressed the earnest wish of his Government to receive a reply to the present Persian proposal at the earliest possible moment, and I am therefore to request that Sir John Simon may be informed at an early date whether Sir Samuel Hoare concurs in a reply being sent on the lines proposed above. 7. Similar letters are being sent to the Admiralty, Air Ministry, War Office and Board of Trade. I am Sir, Your obedient Servant,r'N COPT.
