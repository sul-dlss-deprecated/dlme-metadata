The facts may be briefly suiamariaectias under , &amp; In the month of January of this year the Controller feeling shortage of sugar proposed to the direct importers to import 2000/ bags forthwith but they hesitated as the rates at that tinie were too high and they feared the rates may decline any time whereby tnev may have to undergo loss .But on controller s assuring them that in case of decline in rates the import into Bahrain will be stopped till those 2000/ bags were completely sold out.On this undertaking though many merchants refused eight merchants including ourselves agreedljto import 2000/ oags.Subsequently a meeting was helArherein a joint order for 2000/ uags2 bags sugar was decided upon,The Controller at that time was in so much fear of shortage that not only he aslsathe merchants to import 2000/ bags but asked them A to import as early as possible whereupon he was ax informed tnat sugar could be had cheaper from its place of origin i•e.'JAVA' which would take about two months to arrive at this place but if it was imported from xsm • * India it would each within a fortnight but would cost more.Whereupon he axkd asked for imports from India as it appeared to him that the international situation was such that it was impossible for any one to infer what may happen during these two months hence in his opinion it was wiser to i import from India than taking risk of importing from Java and looking to the risks involved it was immaterial if sugar cost more hence he asked for the imports from India and asured them that they had no reason to fear as under no circumstances they will have to suffer into the transaction and thus 2000/ bags of sugar were imported from Karachi by joint order to maintain uniformity of price from one merchant irresp ective of individual merchants actual shippers. 3^The abovementioned sugar arrived in, Bahrain,oxin the last week of January and after that a consignment of 2^0/bags of sugar actually intended fofc ”Quatif M was allowed for local delivery without calling any meeting even though the rates were falling down in India. Subsequently when K. Mohan das Bros applied for permission to import ^00/bags sugar a meeting of importers was held on l6.^.40 and he was refused the permission.Thereafter Messrs Aujan Bros, who are not regular importers of food stuffs,imported4 r' -7 % 3 imported JOG/bags of sugar and a meeting on 10,4.40* was called where the merchants were assured that should thr^occasion arise the (Jovernment would purchase the ^ sugar at the price fixed for^the full facts are mentioned in exhibit ”0', Ag^in on l6,^,40 a meeting of merchants was held and in consideration of declining- rates it was suggested by the Controller to continue shipments on the distintic understanding that unsold sugar from Grovernment guaranteed sugar willi be proportionately divided among the importers of new sugar on the arrival of the same and the rates to be fixed accordingly.(for particulars please referax exhibit n A w ) 4. Though the rate of sugar was fixed at Rs,28/-but actually no sales took place in the said rate hence our sugar remained unsold full facts have been mentioned in exhibit 'h n ..Also there was no time ' % limit for disposal (as claimed in exhibit 'h^as shown in exhibit n h' which has been written in reply to exhib it n D'. 5, On arrival of the sugar ordered after the abovementioned meeting of l6#^«40 in accordance with the assurances given we applied for jcha fulfilling the guarantees for distributing unsold balance of stock of sugar from the one ordered on Government orders among the new importers but no reply to this point has at all been given and till day neither the said^has been proportionately distributed among the new importe rs nor taken up by Government as promised and remains with us in stock which if sold in present rate of Rs 4ft 22-4-0 would cause us unbearable and ruineous loss. 6. All this trouble in sugar arose when the4 the rates fixed after the arrival of first consignment of about 7000/ bags,after the declaration of war, were quite unfair the reasons are not far to seek and can be easily explained if personal interview is granted to avoid lengthening of this application,Although there were thousands of bags,of sugar,for merchants on way but in consideration of the rates fixed by the Gontro- Her on arrival of the first consignment the merchants were obliged to divert their shipments to other places and no sugar was iraported into Bahirain^iouosxjddcJcxwocx It will not be out of place to mention that the control system has been introduced with the intention of helpingx the consumers by:— (1) Keeping the stocks as high as possible to avoid shortage due to unforeseen cireumstances, (2) keeping the prices reasonable on pre war basis, O) Checking excessive profiteering. (4) Avoiding hoarding and refusing sales. (5) Seeing equal and fair supply to all consumers. (6) hqual and just treatment to all irrespective of their status. So far we have been able to make out from the proclamation of 19.12.^9 issued by H.B.M’s Political Agent,Bahain£. This system is not at all objected to, but the procedure of working system adopted here is quite different if not contrary to the above. 7* As,at present, we are concerned with the guarantee about sugar hence we have refrained from writing beyond that. 8. IW conclusion,we are confident that Your Honor will be fully satisfied from the above mentioned facts of our just and reasonable cause and agree with us that the guarantee given by the Controlled be fulfilled in letter and spirit,the principle forJ* u for which British Government is famous throughout the World. 9* We pray that Your Honor will be pleased to order for execution of guarantees given to us whereby only we will be saved from suffering loss. However' if any doubt arises or any comment is put on our above facts we humbly request we may be given ah opportunity to reply to any adverse criticisim and we shall be ready to satisfy Your Honor with substantial facts.

It is hereby to bring to your attention that in the month of January 1940 your predecessor feeling shortage of sugar asked the merchants to import 2000/bags of sugar but they refused to do so as the rates of overseas market, at that tii^e, were too high hence they feared that possibly they may decline any time whereupon your predecessor gave them guarantee that he would scop imports of lower rates sugar till those 2000/baga were sold out whereupon only 8 merchants including ourselves imported the same and shortly aftenvards the overseas market began to decline whereupon one H. Mohanaas, in the month of y&amp;rch 1940, had applied for the permissionof importing 500/bags and on 16.3.40 your predecessor called a meeting for the same wherein it was decided that he should be refused the permission and thereafter your predecessor on many occasions assured the concerned that if any imports were made they could not be allowed to be sold until the stocks of his guarantee were completely sold out but as time passed on the market overseas went on declining day by day whereupon on 16.5.40 your predecessor called a meeting wherein he explained that on account of changing international conditions and a heavy decline in rates it was better to keep the stocks as high as possible and he said that he had found out the solution whereby the Government guarantee would be kept good and the stocics of this place would increase and the oonsimers will have to pay lower cost and he explained his suggestion that if orders for the purchase of sugar were given, at that time, shipments of the month of yay or early June could be haa and those merchants who wish to import may give orders forthwith and on arrival of the goods of those shipments the balance remaining from the Government Guaranteed stocks would proportionately be given to the importers of new sugar on rates and the rates would be fixed accordingly, and he further assated that all the imports mode in the meantime would be kept unaer Government control and could not be allowed to be sold till the arrival of the aforesaid sugar ana fixing the rates accordingly, thus the Government would be relieved from the responsibility of the guarantee and all will get a fair treatment whereupon all the concerned finding it reasonable agreed to it.Yours faithfully, */r ■ / Now the said sugar has arrived hence we beg to request that you will Kindly inform us that to whom we have to deliver the goods, imported by us on government guarantee, against receiving its value i.e. rs. 28-0-0 per a bag and will also kindly inform them about the same.

In the month of April of this year, the selling rate of Java sugar was fixed at Rs.28/- per bag, which left the importers a clear margin of profit of Rs.2/- per bag; and also for a period of three months no impo^rts of Java sugar were allowed. 3.

Bahrain 18.8.40 After seeding you our application of 15th ins tan' t we are in receipt of youra No.101/59 of 15th instant and in reply to it we beg to state as under: 2. In reply to para 1 of your aboveraentioned letter we have to state that we have not made the application on the subject of rates of sugar but for fulfilling ^ we have never complained that the rate fixed was wnreasonable on the contrary 3 months clearly indicates that you accept that your predecessor had given guarantee mentioned by us, and we thank you for that, and beg to request that at no time there was a word about time limit in the guarantees had there been any ti: e limit there was no necessity of giving such promises as distributing proportionately the balance of sugar from the Government guaranteed stock among the importers of new several meetings, his woras of the meeting of 10th April 1940, mentioned in our application of 15th inaiant would leave no doubt in tne mind of any one; and ther guarantees but the guarantees stood good till the last bag was exhausted hence the question of 5 months period or any period does not arise. 4. in reply to para 3 of your abovementioned letter we have to state that no merchant has been able to sell the Government guaranteed sugar on the price far sold has been disposed on lower rates than that and mostly lower than the actual value of the same, through there was Government guarantee for the same, and according to us, leaving aside the question of finance the other reasons for doing so are (1) any one having no faith in Government guarantees can do io (2) there must be something at the bottom but as this question at present has no connection with the macter hence we do not find it necessary to go in it at present. On the other hand we being loyal British subjects have always been accustomed to see that the promises given by our Government are always fulfilled in letter and spirit and had never any idea nor even upuO thh time have any idea that the premises given by Governments could not be kept by them specially in a Government where there are British as British justice is famous through out the world, hnca the guarantee regarding the some. 3. In reply to para 2 of your abovementioned letter we have to state that we were quite satisfied with it and your reference for not allowing imports for sugar and further the point had been definitely made clear by your predecessor in are several other examples which would prove that there was no ti-.e limit in the fixed by the Government for the same, on the contrary almost the whole quantity soas vvere noi in hurry to sell on loss therefore the question of ourselves selling like others on loss does not arise nor oould be applicable to us nor has any connection with the guarantee. 5. In conclusion the facts mentioned in our applications of 29th ult; and 15th instant and in the above paras would clearly convince you that our request is reaanable and in accordance with the Government guarantees hence we request that it would be complied with at an early da :e.

Reference our discussion the other day at which I promised to let you have the gist of the complaints by the sugar merchants against the State. 2. They say briefly that in January 1940 the Food Con troller, who was then Captain Byard, asked the sugar merchants to import 2000 bags of sugar in order to avoid the risk of any shortage here, -hey further say that he promised that in case of any fall in rates no other sugar would be allowed to be sold in Bahrain until the whole of these 2000 bags v/ere completely sold out. On this assurance eight merchants includi ng the applicants Messrs. Hirjimal Dhamanmal &amp; Co., Goverdhandas Dharamaas &amp; Co., and Purshotamdas Vasumal, ordered jointly 2000 bags of sugar. As the Controller ’ ,,as in a hurr y sugar was, at his request, imoorted from India and he again assured them against any loss. -hey further state that the Controller asked them to continue shipments on the understanding that unsold sugar from these 2000 bags would be proportionately divided among the impcrtefs of fresh consignments and rates would be fixed accordingly. The rate was fixed at Es 28/- per bag but no sales took place and the applicants , sugar has remained unsold. The applicants say that they then applied that according to the assurances given their unsold balance of stock should be distributed amoneist the imoorters of fresh supplies. The ? ood Controller replied to this application on the 15th August saying that in the month of April 1940 the selling rate of Java sugar was fixed at Rs 28/- per bag C.

The merchants contend however that no limit of three months was fixed and that the guarantees still hold good and that the prices have fallen much below Rs 28/- per bag and they request that the sugar may accordingly be taken over at that price according to the assurances alleged to have been given. 3.

The above fact needs no clarification but is a clear proof to show that no uniformity of principle is oeing adopted in declaring tne rates hence this discriminating procedure is giving unuue advantage to those in whose favour it is using practiced. 2, It will not be out of place to mention that the new arrived on which the rates were announced were only a fractional percentage of stock on hand as can be easily ascertained from tne weekly returns of the same date submitted by the merchants. Bor should a eonsign- \ ment arrived thereafter and which was not till the date of notifica tion cleared irom the Customs be taken as basis lor calculations. also by the same steamer (Bamora 2^1) consignment ol Calcutta rice has arrived which will be at least equql the quantity of the stock on hand still no rates have been declared for the said rice, it is very surprising tnat arx-Lkiils on arrival of fractional ^percentage of the stocks of one v^ualJity tne rates are altered while on equal quantity of other no rates are announced. 4. The reasons can be easily ascertained by referring to the weekly individual returns ol merchants which will no doubt satisfy thrt this had led to monopoly of trade in this commodity being enjoyed by one merchant only whose interests are safe guarded and his arrivals however fractional they may be are considered as basis for increasing the rates whereby not only a clear margin of profit is assured to him but a free overturn without any locking up of capital is assured. p. Further we would bring to your attention tnat Rangoon rice of s.s. Barpeta 2b7 though definately marked RB were allowed for local delivery and also some hundreds ol bags though actually taken overside delivery were noticed by us after a period of more than a fortnight, to be removed for local delivery possibly under some false pretexts but actually wi^n the sole object ol shipping another quality of rice instead Irom tne local stocks. 6.

So far we know that the said rice of overside delivery landed here are still actually lying in Stockland there is every possibility of the same being tampered wrtn no sooner the contents of thrs explication are known to the concerned. d.

The control system, if carried in accordance with H.B.M’s Proclamation is expected to be in favour of local merchants in consideration of the existing cirdistances as it would avoid dumping into market by outsiders as has been the experience of the last war. quite a new man unaware of the mercantile line hence naturally he had to depend on his subordinate who taking undue advantage of the above fact has been helping xhblxk some vested interests which is the main cause oi complaint.

M ! s Political Agent is being taken advantage j of and is being used as a strong weapon. H. Weekly returns of stocks of merchants though I dispensed with and only one person is func tioning in his own autocratic way. 7. ihe above facts if inquired fully would no doubt reveal that the very principles for which the control system has been introdu ced have been oblitrated whereby one party being in touch of the facts can easily get inside into the actual position of trade and thereby have indirect monopoly and thus divert trade by being certain of a clear margin of profit and an assured overturn without any detention 8 . A short discription of chief commodities is given to make it more clear:- Rangoon Rice ;- Is the chief commodity consumed by poor people hence main item of trade. On declaration of war about 30000/- bags were imported by Bahrain Government as stocks on hand seemed in adequate to meet the emergency for which there was every possibility in consideration of previous war^ experience. Along with the above 30000 / bags about 16000/ bags were imported by one merchant at a time when owing to un-certainties of the effect on declaration of war when promised confidential but advantage is being taken to put in touch of stocks on hand which revealation works as a guide to place fresh orders. !• Though a committee of merchants was appoint- I ed but it has never functioned and also to assist the controller two of the Government subordinates were appointed one has been axs or lock up of finance-4- when the rates had gone up by leaps and bounds. _but the present war so far imports from India are concerned has produced no such effect on trade specially all transport facilities and no restrictions of export brought the trade to pre-war conditions. This naturally upset the plans of greedy importer of 16000/ bags who was to suffer heavy loss in his transaction owing to decline in rates at port of shipment. Under principles of freedom of trade observed throughout the British Empire the rice imported by Government could not be taken from that point of view and it was im-material if there was any loss in the Government imported rice which were imported for welfare of its &lt; subject. But here taking advantage of the above rice in order to help the ambitious importer on the rates having fallen down enormously under guise of disposal of Government imported rice, all the importers were prohibited by verbal orders from placing any fresh orders on 8 th November 1939. Our firm claimed to have placed orders for 3500/ fts/uccA,** e/ I \ bags and another merchant for 700 / bags and only those imports were &gt;• permitted. This prohibition remained in force till 4 th may 1940 when - - xjlXsfil j., by verbal orders the imports were made free. But before the above official public announcement there was effected a shipment for Bahrain from hangoon by s.s. Itodia which left the port of shipment on or about 28-4-40 at a time when the rates were favourable there. This ■^clearly speaks for itself that those who had pre intimation were able to pre purchase in favourable rates. The free import was announced to the public after the rates had increased at Rangoon. Under the then existing procedure of control it was not possible, from a mercantile point of view, for a merchant to place orders in higher rates. Also instead of shipment from Rangoon the rice were imported from Bombay for which there are definate surmises which it is not advisable to meantion at this stage. Government Imported rice;- We refrain from writing further than what concerns us. It is submitted that the direct importer s who hesitatingly purchased the first half of the lot did not purchase the second half inspite of the fact that the import was prohibited and as an inducement a margin of 0 - 4-0 per bag more was allowed than the first half. With a clear margin of profit and being the chief commodity of trade with no stock available the merchants refused to purchase can not be without reasons. An inquiry into the matter would reveal a good- good deal about Government rice is) Sughandi Rice from Rangoon;- On declaration of war the ofiicial rate of Rs. 9 - 8-0 ( though actually it was lower ) v/as declare d. fey Though reasonable quantity was imported by one merchant no official rate for sale were announced and also fresh imports were prohibited. Thus monopoly was given to one merchant and as no rates for sale were fixed the importer was selling the said rice in higher rates at his personal discretion and went on increasing the rates of the said lot in contravention of the contrl system. This continued for a period of about ten months till 5 - 8-40 when for the first time controller announced the official rates. Sugar;- Has a long history. .Before the declaration of war preceding four months the rates of sugar had declined from Rs. 8-0-0 to Rs. 4-8-0 C.I.F. Bahrain. This obliged the merchants to dispose of their stocks on hand and place new orders in lower rates as sugar transactions are always from Java where forwar^d contract^ shipment are carried out. On declaration of war naturally due to above facts the stock of sugar was very limited and there was un-natural demand from the consumers. A consignment of about 7000/ bags was already on way. But on arrival of the above sugar rates were so fixed that no margin of profit v/as allowed and this obliged the merchants to divert their shipments from local entry. Also on the declaration of war a proposal of 6000/ bags for import was rejected as it was proposed by our firm. This naturally caused a heavy demand on sugar and the controller fearing shortage asked the merchants to import from India instead of Java which naturally costed higher rates. Though a guarantee for the above sugar was given that no imports will be permitted yet one merchant was allowed to import 250 / bags under circumstances unknown to us. An application has already been made in this connection wherein all the facts have been me/ntioned. How we have been effected can be explained in detail if called upon to do. Loaf Sugar;- The chief stockists were our firm and one another firm which v/as connected with our representative and on the declaration oi war the ofiicial rate declared by customs was lower than actual selling rate of market. Loaf sugar was always linked with Java sugar and is considered as a luxury and not a necessity of life. Though an application was made to controller but remained unreplied.The result was that not a single bag can be imported and due to uneven rates abnormal demand consumed £he whole stock in contravention of usual average consumption. Crystal Sugar;- Is superior than Java sugar and is mostly consumed by Persian ports. Though no import was made still the rates as announced were quite unjust in comparison of Java sugar which deprived the stockists of legitmate right. The matter was referred to h.B.M’s Political Agent a perusal will satisfy. The stockists of this sugar was our firm and two others. The rates were so uneven that the stock was sold out in course of a week inspite of our nolding in stock fS for over two years. This sugar is not of common use as can be ascert ained from the list of weekly returns. Coffee Mangalore;- Is chiefly consumed by Mainland ports and very limited quantity is locally required. On the declaratio n of war the export was prohibited except under special permit issued by the controller vide para 2 of Ji.B.M’s Political Agent ! s Proclamatio n dated 19-12-39. How undue advantage has been taken of the above can be easily had by actual export allowed ma. to merchants by referring to shipping bills from the start of control system till 9th December 1939 when being obliged the merchants put in application for permissi on to export, hot only that but it can be proved that actually more quantity ’was shipped than the permit granted for export. This obliged us to stop our free dealing in this commodity. Previous three years records will prove that our firm was the first shipper for local. 9. The above are some of the glaring instances to show that we have been obliged to suspend our normal activities of pre war days owing to uneven treatment being given to the commodities of which we were the higher stockists on the declaration of war. Naturally we have been the most sufferers and this has obliged us to suspend our normal activities as can be clear from the imports during the corresponding period of April 1940 to September 1940. The control system was not meant for diverting of trade from one to another and helping the favourites. 10. It will be clear from the above facts that all help is being given to one party by all possible means and their margin of profit being assured the trade has been diverted into their hands-7- C53 hands and have thus indirect monopoly of trade. Having thus helped them they are being misrepresented to the higher authorities as being very loyal to help the control system and are being given all £he facilities whenever required to have full and free overturn of their trade without any financial lock up and by being in touch of stocks on hand. 11. It will not be out of place to mention that in order to give equal treatment to all the following may be kindly taken into consideration. 1. The work of control should be in charge of one who may have no connection direct or indirect with the merchants. (The controller himself dose not ) take active part and possibly may not be aware of these tactics) but everything is dependant on his subordinate who has dispensed with a committee and | co-subordinate so appointed. 2. The prices of all food-stuffs must be declared by the controller in strict confirmity of h.B.M f s Proclamation i.e. every ten days are three days after the arrival. 3. Balances of stocks of chief commodities to be officially declared weekly to hk enable the merchants to place fresh orders in consideration of stocks on hand. 4. Uniformity of system in fixing thB rates should be ' observed. 5 . Definate procedure for export from local cargo to I be announced to give equal treatment to all. At present the above has been made a strong weapon to subdue any merchant. 6 . Mo verbal orders to be issued and a record to be maintained in writing to avoid any misrepresen tation and to have a systemetical procedure. ! 12. In conclusion we respectfully submit that if an appoint ment is given to us we shall be able to substantiate and corroborate our statements by facts and proofs where ever required in support of our contentions.To avoid this petition too lengthy we have refrained from- 8 - from giving full details. &amp;($i 1 3. With humble request that your Honor will be pleased to hold an inquiry into the above matter and see that the contrl system gives aaal equal treatment to all and is carried on in this port as has been through out the British Empire specially India on which depends the main food-stuff supplies for which till day no ban has been imposed so far Bahrain is concerned hence there is no cause for any special procedure to be adopted. 14. Though we have mentioned our grievances but an inquiry will satisfy that the above facts have a direct effect on general trade of food-stuffs and the public at large. 15* If Your Honor, after inquiry, is satisfied that we have been the actual sufferers and our trade has been nearly stopped the loss so caused to us may kindly be taken into consideration. hoping to be excused for this lengthy application We beg to remain, Sir, Your most obedient servants &amp; Loyal SubjectNo .925/^55 Government of Bahrain, Custom r Director.

B. M T s Political Agent, BAHRAIN. MEMORANDUM:- ^ 1 yr^y In reference to your No:C/ / 948-l a/ / 48-B of the 7-l^-40., for your information, I would recapitulate the position of Rangoon Rice Some years ago, the Hon’ole the Resident ( Lt-Col.Sir Hugh Biscoe K.B.E.) obtained from the Saudi-Arabian Government permission for Hindu firms to open branches at Q,atif, for trading at their own risk in the usual manner. Some disappointment w T as expressed by such as wanted the Government to guarantee their ^ position in Arabia; but the local firm of Haridas Janimal opened a branch at q,atif some 8-9 years ago, where they trade chiefly in Rice. Later the firm of Dhamanmal Isardas opened a branch there, and have recently opened another branch at Jubail. Mr. Karko Bunya is a partner in the firm of Haridas Janimal; and his younger brother is e partner in the firm of ^ Hirjimal Dhamanmal. During the period from 1st September, 1939, to 7th December, 1940, the following quantities of rice were transhipped within the port to the mainland of Arabia;- 1. Messrs Dhamanmal Isardas 60,000 bags. 2. Hajy Abdulaziz Aly al Bassam. . . .45,000 bags. 3. Messrs Haridas Janimal 20,000 bags. 4. Al Rouq and Al Zaraal 9,500 bags. 5. Hajy Muhummad Abdullah Al Kazy. . . 4,500 bags. 6. Hajy Suliman Hamad Al Bassam. . . . 3,800 bags. 7. Messrs Ratanchand Dipchand 3,500 bags. 8. Hajy Suliman Fahad Al Bassam. . . . 2,400 bags. 9. Hajy Yusuf Uy Akbar 1,700 bags. 10. Messrs Al ^ us&amp;it) y &amp; Bros., 500 bags. 11. M .Goverdhandas Dharamdas,. . . 325 bags. 12. ” Hirjimal Dhamanmal. * . . . . Nil. 13. ' Purchotamdas Vasumal, ... Nil. It will thus be seen that the largest trader in rice to the mainland is the firm of Dhamanmal Isardas. In reference to the rice market in Bahrain, in September, 1939, the Bahrain Government decided to import about 30,000 bags of rice as a reserve against contingencies; and for that purpose employed Dhamanmal Isardas as its buying agents, since this is the largest local firm dealing in rice. (It is probably correct to state that during the past three years, sixty per cent of the imports of rice into Bahrain have been made by this firm). The controlled prices of rice have been: 1939, 4th November, Rs:9.8.0 per bag; M 24th December, M 10.0.0 M ' 1940 22nd April, ” 10.4.0 ' ' “ 22nd July, ”12.0.0 ” ” ” 2nd September ” 12.8.0 ” ” M 13th November ”13.8.0 ” ” ” 4th December, ” 14.0.0 ' ” a These prices are fixed periodically according to the rule in clause (3) of the Order by the Political Agent, of 19th December, 1939, under Emergency Regulation No:2.In December, 1939, the Bahrain Government decided sell openly to all rice importers this reserve stock; and from the 27th December, 1939, until the 6th ?Iay, 1940., the following sales took place, no distinction being made between the bidders: v .Jiimal took 3,000 bags, while Dhamanmal Isardas took 16,393 bags. advised the rice dealers not to import more rice lest the stocks should become too heavy; and there was no great urgency to do so while Government stocks were available, as export prices were increasing. However, importers urged that they should continue to ^mport according to their previous commitments, which was agreed to. It takes about six weeks for a consignment of rice to arrive here from Rangoon. largest stocks of rice ( i.e. Dhamanmal Isardasj would be likely to earn a greater profit if the price rises, or a greater loss if the price fell. Similarly Haridas Janimal, having 1 ess to risk, would make a less profit. Now the firm of Dhamanmal Isardas already carried a stock of about 7,000 bags; and during the above period they imported about 16,000 bags in addition to their purchases from the Government. Consequently, having taken the risk of such a large stock, they were likely to gain on a rising market, and could easily ' ra^t competition, which in fact occurred. Messrs Haridas Janimal were not in such a favourable position, and consequently were jealous. rice, it could not have been removed on the 4th May, 1940. S In June, 1940, local stocks were becoming low; and the craders were advised to import more rice, which would be dearer in price. It happened, however, that in the past summer the Japanese Government purchased a huge quantity of Rangoon Rice, which greatly affected the stocks held there; and purchases for Bahrain were not quite so easy as might have been expected. The price has steadily increased, and is likely to do so until next season’s crop is on the market. Since the 22nd June, 1940, until the 6th December,1940. , the following quantities of Rangoon Rice were imported:- Messrs Haridas Janimal 2,000 bags. 2,000 bags. 5, 000 bags. 2.000 bags. 3.000 bags. 2, 000 bags. 1.000 bags. 5.000 bags. 2.000 begs. 5.000 bags. 1,393 bags.

Dharamdas 12. M Vasumal..r • It will thus be seen that Dhamanraal Isardas imported about sixty per cent of the total quantity. The favourable position of Dhamanmal Isardas is due to their shrewdness in judgment, and their financial ability to take the risk of loss on a falling market; and they would ofcourse gain a somewhat greater profit on their old stocks bought cheaply than on new stocks bought recently. But no dealer can sell at a price greater than is permitted by the Pood Controller. for the convenience of this firm is nonsensical, inspired by a jealous competitor, since the same price applies to every importer. For that reason, with your approval, I do not propose to take any action in the matter, because no action is necessary, please. The false suggestion that controlled prices are adjusted FOOD CONTROLLER.J Fr. Faridas 'Janimal came to 3 e me on the 19th December 1940 and with regard to the Food Control Order under Regulation S issued by the Political Agent he states that his complaints are as follows: He states that instead of a special permit being issued to merchants for the export of their goods from Bahrain the ordinary shipping bills are demanded. On occasions hen he has desired to exnort cargo from Bahrain he has been verbally requested by the Customs authorities to put in a shipping bill for the amount which it is either writes his sanction on the bill itself or in other been told this verbally. When the return of he bill has been asked the request has been refused. He states that it apoears that unfair discrimination I is being shown in allowing some persons to export ca^go and in refusing permission to others. These will be clear i Applicant says that he recently put in an application to ship a consignment of this to the mainland which was re fused v/hile to another nerson permission was given. states however that merchants may desire from time to time to export othe^ articles which they find to be surplus in their stocks and for this purpose they may have again to apply for special permits. Article 3 According to this article the maximum prices of certain articles are to be fixed at intervals of 10 days or should a consignment arrive in the meantime then within 3 days after the arrival of such consignment whichever mav be the shorter oeriod. The applicant says that this is not Article 2 desired to export. Thereafter the Director of Customs cases the bill is is not sanction ^ and the applicant has I from the lists of exports of local cargo. The difficulty has now largely disappeared as HD cargo arrives marked HS and is shipped to its destination without delay. The only exception which remains is coffee from Fangalore.being done. He says for example that the nr ice for rice was la^t fixed on the 5th December and tlhat no further price hasb een fixed since then. The applicant gives a specific instance in the case of some superior quantity Tangoon rice which he imported some three months back. The rate was fixdd at the time at Fs 13/8? since then no further rate for this par icular rice has been issued although under Article 3 they should be issued every ten days. Tn the case of jira Hangoon rice (a superior grzde) a rate of] 11/12 was notified about -Tune this year; since then no further rates for this rice haveb een noti fied and the public owing to non-issue of notices fixing the price are unaware of what they should pay and are being charged Fs 14/ or 15/ for the same quality of rice. He also states that for the last six monthp no prices have been fixed in resoect of cotton anp woolen piecegoods. 'Articl e 4 This article states that oricelists for all the articles named will be exhibited on all notice boards. Applicant states that however that no such lists are exhibited on the notice boards in the town or on |the Customs nbtice board with the result th 2 t the public are unaware of the rates which have been fixed for the sale of the various articles. Article 8 states that merchants are required to maintain accounts and records relating to their business in such form as may be prescribed by the Food Controller. Applicant states that the Food Controller has not issued any orders prescriving the accounts and records to be kept up by merchants as required by article 8. Applicant states that all merchants are submitting weekly returns A . : »to the Food Controller showing the sales of commodities and the balance of stock remaining in their hands. He says J that these returns which are suoposed to be confidential have on occasions leaked out to the disadvantage of some parties and that it would be fairer if the return of total stocks of general commodities in Hah^ain were to be made public for the information of all concerned. Tm*Mr, Haridas Janimal c ame to see me on the I9th December 1940 and stated that he is having trouble vd. th his letters between Oatif and Bahrain. He states that s great delay amounting to 10 or 15 days is experienced in receiving replies frbm his agents in ^atif and that he is certain that certain competitors of his in Bahrain are getting their letters smuggled thorugh on dhows very much quicker xM thus causing him g^eat damage in his trade. The transmission of lett jrs between Bahrain and the main land by hand of private individuals is forbidden but in the case of certain merchants the Customs petty officials are allowing their letters to come through unchecked. He says that the Manager and the Bead Clerk are both Hindus of many years service in the Customs and that they are favouring rival concerns amongst the TT indu traders.fVt&gt;- c (1- Would you very kindly let ;i.e h?,ve figures shoeing the i:, ; orte of rice inic Bc tireia by the various io^orters engaged in this trtue uuring the year and this year u . tc ictc as far ea possible.

The Director of Customs for information.&gt;• H D.O, No. C/25-1.fl/48-B Dated the 8th January 1941 Dalrymple Belgrave t Ssq., C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain. With reference to the meeting which took place in the Custom House on Saturday the 28th December 1940 at which you, the Director of Customs and myself were present together with Messrs. Kakhoomal of Haridss Janimai &amp; Co., Hirjimal Dhaman ial, Gobindas Dharamdas and Purshotamdas Vasumal, who had certain complaints to make regarding the working of the food control system as it effected themselves. 2. The first point reised was regarding the issue of special permits under Article 2 of the Order (Food Control). They stated that Instead of a special permit being issued to the merchants for the export of their goods from Bahrain the ordinary shipping bills were demanded. On occasions when it was desired to export cargo from Bahrain they had been verbally requested by the Customs staff to put in a shipping bill for the amounts desired to be exported. Thereafter the Director of Customs either writes his sanction on the bill itself or in other cases the bill is not sanctioned end the applicant is informed verbally. Vhon the return of the bill has been asked the request has been refused. They allege unfair dis crimination in allowing some persons to export cargo and in refusing permission to others. The difficulty has now largely disappeared as re-export cargo arrives marked HE and is shipped straight to destination. The only exception which tamalns is coffee from Mangalore. Mr. Fakhoomal states that he recently put in a declaration to ship a consignment of this to the mainland which was refused while to another person permission was given. He states however that merchants may desire from time to time to export other articles which they find to be surplus in their stocks. 3 /-3. With regard to the issue of special permits it was admitted that it was the practice to endorse the permit on the shipping bills submitted' by the applicants and although there is perhaps nothing which could be objected to in this there seems no reason why the bills should not be marked so and returned to the owners for their record and for use as evidence should they wish to make any representation. At present they have nothing to show the dates on which they made their applications nor the results thereof. In this connection I noticed that the reason given for withholding rejected bills and keeping them' in the Customs was to prevent merchants 'repeating the attempt'• It should be noted that it is quite legitimate end in keeping with the Order for merchants to apply for permission to export goods as many times as they wish and the Controller would normally give his permission if the stocks in the Islands were considered sufficient. 4. As regards the allegations of discrimination in favour of some merchants and in particular Mr. Kakhoomal*s complaint about Mangalore coffee it was agreed that he should call on the Director of Customs and explain the matter which would be investigated. I should be grateful to know? the results of these enquiries when completed. 5. In regard to Article 3 of the Order. According to this Article maximum prices for certain articles are to be fixed at intervals of 10 days or, should a consignment arrive in the meantime, 3 days after the arrival of such consignment, whichever may be the shorter period. The applicants stated that this was not being done. Mr. Kakhoomal said for example that the price for rice was last fixed on the 5th December and that no further price had been fixed since then. He also gave a specific instance in the case of some superior quality of Rangoon rice which he imported some three months back. The rate was fixed at the time at Rs 13/8 per bag; since then no further rate forthis particular quality was declared although under Article 3 rates should have been issued every 10 days. In the case of 'jira' Rangoon rice (a superior grade) a rate of Rs 11/- was notified in about June last year; since then no further rates for this rice had been notified. He also states that for the last 6 months no prices have been fixed in respect of cotton and woollen piecegoods. 6. It was admitted on this that the Food Controller does not fix prices at intervals of 10 days and it was also established that prices are not fixed 3 days after the arrival of a consign ment. On the contrary in some cases they are not fixed until 10 or 15 days after the arrival of the ship as in the case of the 'Bandra” which arrived about the 2nd November 1940 and the rate for one consignment of rice on it was declared on the 13th November and on another quality of rice by the same ship on the 4th December 1940. 7. Applicants also hold that Article 4 of the Order was being contravened in that price lists were not exhibited on all notice boards; indeed they were not even exhibited on the Customs Notice Board and that if the meeting would examine the board on the spot no notice would be found there. 8. I am afraid th^t the applicants are right in saying that Article 3 of the Order has not been observed. Article 3 is very clear and is mandatory i.e. it is not optional on the Food Controller to fix or not fix prices at his discretion; also the wording of the Order shows that maximum prices are to be fixed at even shorter intervals than 10 days should a cargo arrive in the meantime. The meaning of the Article appears to be that the Food Controller should regulate prices at intervals of not more than 10 days with reference to the general trend of prices. It cannot I think be taken to mean that the price of a consign ment is to be fixed at the time of its arrival and then subse quently left unchanged until the arrival of a fresh consignment£ - 4 - of the &amp;ame commodity but this is what is being done by the Food Controller with the result that if a merchant imports a superior quality of rice, for example, and takes 4 or 5 months to sell it he might find himself having to sell it at say te 10/- per bag i«e« the maximum rate fixed at the time of its arrival. Another merchant importing a cheaper rice and having a quicker turn over may get his price raised on the arrival of each consignment and be selling his inferior rice at r 14/- per bag. In addition to this all his previous stocks lying in the warehouse will also rise automatically in price each time a new consignment arrives. And this is actually the position to-day and is due solely to the provisions of Article 3 not being followed, as it should have been. Mr. Kakhoomal also alleged that consignments of two different qualities of rice arrived per S.S. H 3amora* about November 2nd one was Rangoon rice consigned to Dhamanmal Isardas &amp; Co. on which the rate was declared on 13th November. By the same ship other merchants received a consignment of Bellam rice for which no rate was fixed until 4th December. Thus Bellam rice hrd to be sold at the previous and cheaper maximum rate while Rangoon rice together with all previous imports of the same kind imme diately scored a rise. And this he states is an example of unfair discrimination in favour of the firm mentioned above. 9. I should be glad therefore to know the reason as to why the provisions of Article 3 of the Food Control Order issued by this Agency had not been observed and I would also be grateful to know as to whether the allegation regarding the two consign ments of rice by S.S. Bamora are correct and if so the reason for net fixing the maximum prices for Bellam rice at the same time as those of the Rangoon rice. 10. As regards the allegation that Article 4 is being contra vened and that rates are not being exhibited on notice boards I had the notice board in the Custom House examined by an official of this Agency at the time the complaint was made and it /-- 5 - •rN -'A it was reported to me that no price lists for the articles mentioned in the Order were being exhibited on that day. I should be glad therefore to know the reason why this was not being done* I should also be glad to know the reason for no prices having been fixed in respect of cotton and woollen piecegoods as required by Article 3. These articles are regularly being imported* 11* Applicants also stated that merchants are required under Article 8 to maintain accounts and records relating to their business in such form as may be prescribed by the Food Controller* Mr* Kakhoomal states that the Food Controller has not issued any orders prescribing the accounts and records to be kept up by merchants under this article* He ©Iso states that merchants are submitting weekly reports to the Food Controller showing sales of commodities and the balance on stock remaining in their hands. He says that these returns which are confidential have on occasions leaked out to the disadvantage of some parties and that it would be fairer if the return of total stocks of general commodities in Bahrain were to be made public for the information of all concerned* I should be glad to have your opinion on this suggestion which has the merit of depriving anyone of the chance to allege that information has leaked out to trade competitors* 12. The applicants went on to say that on the 8th November 1939 the merchants had been sent for by Mr* Kumbi and asked to furnish figures of consignments of Rangoon rice which they may have ordered or which were actually on the way and they were also asked to give a promise in writing not to import any more of this rice until further notice* The reason given by the applicants is that the State had Imported 30|000 bags of rice through Messrs. Dhamanmal Isardas &amp; Co* to guard against shortage and that it was desired to withhold further imports until this rice could be disposed of* But they also allege that /-that Messrs. Dhamanmal Isardas had Imported 16,000 begs of his own rice and that this prohibition on the import was giving him a favourable field for disposal of his stocks along with those ol the 3tate. They further said that it was not until about the 4th ay 1940 x,hat they were again allowed to resume imports. The Director oi Customs had no recollection of any such promise being taken as he was on leave at the time. ATr• Kumbi admits that merchants put in signed slips giving quantities of rice which they had ordered but on the slips being asked for by me they w’ere not forthcoming. I should be grateful to be informed as to whether there is any truth in the allegation that promises were taken from merchants to suspend all imports of this quality of rice until further orders. There is of course nothing in the Order to empower the Food Controller to prevent imports of food stuffs since the more imports take place the lower prices are likely to fall and the Food Control system is designed primarily to ensure supply and to keep down prices both of which are assisted by large imports, and conversely, retarded if imports are stopped. promises v/ere not taken from the merchants it may kindly be stated as to v/hat the reason was for asking them to hand in signed slips showing the amounts of Rangoon rice on order. I would also be glad if I could see some of these slips especially those signed by the applicants.

The Agency, BAHRAIN, Persian Gulf. Dated 14 th January 1941 Reference to previous correspondence:✓ DoOo 1970/3*. Bahrain, January 22, 1941. Dear Alban Reference your D«0. No. C/B5-la/48-3 dated 8th January 1941. I spent another morning at the Customs going over the quest the position fully. 2. A separate letter has been sent to you regarding Mr. Kakoomal’s complaint about coffee. 3. Regarding your para 6. from the time that measures for food control were instituted prices have been fixed according to the price of goods at the time of their importation into Bahrain, these prices have not depended on any subsequent price fluctuations in India, nor upon general trend of prices locally. In fact some commodities have been sold at less than the fixed price, which is the maximum, but this has not affected the price laid down by the Food Controller. I have seen the circulars regarding any change in prices which are sent to all importers, and signed by them, and I have seen the complainants 1 signatures on these notices. I am sorry that deCrenier did not bring up this point at the first meeting. 4. It is my suggestion that merchants should be consulted before the government publishes a state ment showing stocks held by every merchant. If the merchants agree to this the list can be published in the weekly paper but I think before taking this action -action their approval should be obtained. 5. The allegation that merchants were ordered not to import more rice, after the government’s large importation, is denied. I fully realise that it is not within the power of the .Food Controller to forbid the import of foodstuffs, nor any other legal import, nor would this government wish to prevent imports. They were asked to give details of rice in stock and on order in order that the Food Controller should know how much was on the way and for how many months Bahrain had an assured supply of rice. The slips have not been filed and I am unable to produce a specimen. 6. I have discussed this matter with the senior Bhaikhs. I found some difficulty in making them understand the details but they assured me that the general public were deeply grateful to the government for the measures which it has taken and they had heard no complaint whatever from any of the merchants. Yours sincerely, Major R. G. E. .7. ^Iban, O.B.E., H.B.M’s Political Agent, Bahrain.1AM., \. 1 A/o \ Fc / in /*7 To;- II. B. M’s Political Agent, BAHRAIN MHMORANHJM:- THE CUSTOMHOUSE: BAHRAIN ^trth January, 1940., PSth Bhul Haj, 1359., 14- U O I' May I incite your consideration of clause (3) of the Order of 19th December, 1939 made under Regulation 2. by The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf: which reads; '(3) In respect of the following articles maximum prices will be fixed 'by the Food Controller at intervals of ten days or three days after 'the arrival of any cargo of such articles, whichever may be the /^'shorter period.,' In this respect the wording may not be entirely clear; but I suspect that the intention was that sale prices should be fixed every ten days; but if, in such an interval, a fresh consignment of a commo dity should be imported, then the sale price should be changed in '^'accordance with the imported value ( i.e. prime cost y of this latest consignment. I do not xnow if it was the original intention that the retail market price should vary with the retail marxet price obtaining in some part or another of India; but, if such was the case, this can not be put into practice because (a) India is not Bahrain, where the local market is obviously very much smaller; and (b) the upward trend of Indian prices would enable a local wealthy importer to have accu mulated large stocks, which he would sell at ever-increasing profits, and thus ’profiteering’ would result by holding up the market; and(c) the cost of telegraphed Indian market prices from the nearest market, i.e. Karachi, would be very expensive, and only serve to support (b;. r-s The practical working of this clause has been: to fix the .Local sale price of the commodity, having ensured a ten per cent profit to the importer, upon the prime cost of the latest import of such commodity. When another import does not come forward within ten days, the necessity for changing the sale price naturally does not ^ arise; and the importer cannot suffer because his profit has already been assured to him. The fact that the prices in India might, in the interval, have risen cannot affect such a price in the absence of a fresh import. I take it that the purpose of the Food Control is to protect the consumer, generally a poor man, from profiteering by importer’s holding up stocks; and I submit that this method achieves this purpose. I propose, every ten days, to republish the sale prices of all commodities, in addition to publishing the changes in prices; but I am most anxious that the principle upon which the prices are fixed P.S.Since writing the above, I have seen Major A.C.Byard who quite definitely confirms that it was originallyagreed that the Bahrain sale prices should not be connected in any way with any Indian sale prices, but depend upon the latest Bahrain prime cost.r No: PA/S’C/ BAHRAIN 15th January, 1941., 15th Dhul Haj, 1359., To: - H. B. M's Political Agent, BAHRAIN. MEMORANDUM In reference to the meeting on the 28th December last, when Messrs Haridas Janimal ( i. e .Mr .Karku Bunya} and Ike. Goverdh; nde s Dharamdas complained that they had been refused permission to export hence to the Arabian mainland mangalore coffee from their existing stocks; I would report that I subsequently saw these two importers, and heard the details of their position; Their complaints were;- COMPLAINT: 1. We are the leading importers of Mangalore coffee, which is consumed by Arabs on the main land more than locally. 2. The season for this export business is from January to June in every year. 3. On 14th March 1940 I was refused permission to export 31 bags of this coffee. 4. Aw out the end of April I was not granted permission to export some bags (quantity not ^nown,. 5. Pn 13th October I was refused perw-xssion to export ten Dags. 6. The local controlled sale price is Rs:19.8.0., but I can sell on the mainland at about Rs:22-23/- Hence the Food Control involves me in a loss. 7. I have been unable to import more coffee becuase this permit was refused. 8. Mr. G.Dharamdas said;- I complain because somewhere in November my Shipping Bill for export of coffee w r as refus ed. REPLY : 1. The feeding importers are Messrs Dhamanmal Iserdas &amp; Ratanchand Dipchand. There are more Arab consumers on the mainland than in Bahrain, as it is a larger country. 2. True. 3. The export of foodstuffs from Bahrain is prohibited except under a special permit issued by the Food Controller, which permit is (or is not y granted having regard to local stocks on hand. Mr. Karku's stock was then 53 bags; 31 bags would re present more than 5C$ of this small stock, (see skeleton S/B herewith. 'A”). 4. No such permission was applied for. 5. Permission was refused because on the 2nd &amp; 7th October he had beer permitted to export in all twenty be gs. 5. He was not involved in s loss, but in less profit see oelow for records of his sales. The local controlled price allows ten per cent profit to the importer, which all the merchants agreed to oe adequate. This is a bluff, as most of his stock was sold locally. The true reason for lack of further imports is quite different. 6. He is not entitled to export; and he was refused permission because his local stock was low.-3- ) I i 1 I Thus it will he seen that the working of the Food Control has not prevented the two complainants from doing business; but the quantity of business fane must obviously depend upon their own enterprise. I understand that the business of the Food Control is: HOT to assist an importer to make a profit at the expense of the consumer; but (having seen that a fair profit is secured upon the last imported value) to ensure the retention in Bahrain of an adequate stock of a commodity. The difference in the size and nature of the Indian market from that in Bahrain prevents the fixing of a fluctuating retail sale price; and ohe fairest method is to fix the local price upon the Bahrain value of the latest import of the commodity. This principle was, I understand, originally agreed upon, as it is equitable to all concerned and serves to keep down the retail prices to the consumers, plea.se.3 Bahrain, November, 1939.

No.u/2^-1,a/4B—B or ^he ^8th January, 1941.*^] to each clause, as far as is possible: l.The purpose of the Pood Control is (a) to conserve in the Stace of Bahrain a sufficiency of foodstuffs, particularly of the commodities in general consumption by the greater part of the population, who are very poor people, as distinguished from luxuries; ib) to protect the public from profiteering by importers, wholesalers, and retailers of general commodities, and * (c) having achieved these ends, to ensure to the importers and the wholesalers a fair profit on their trading. -or this a profit of ten per cent upon the prime cost was agreed by the importers to be fair when fixing a maximum price, they being at liberty 01 course to deal at lower prices in business competition. ~hus the interests of one or two merchants must be subordinated to the well-being of the whole. -he Pood Control operates under the authority given in H.B.M*s Political Agent’s Order under Emergency Regulation No.2. dated the 19th December, 1939. At fiJ^st a number of meetings were r Id oy .B.M’s Political Agent, and The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, and the \hen Pood Controller, when verbal decisions were made and put into effect. Clause It will be remembered that no foodstuffs may be exported from Bahrain without a previous permit from the Pood Controller, who exercises his discretion having regard to (a) the quantity of stock held generally, and (b) the stock held oy the applicant. . jm application for pe^rmissUbn to export had tq.oe.. &gt; made to the -ood Controller; and, after permission was grantedV’'the .exporter^ took out his Shipping Bill at the Customs and observed the usual procedure. . &gt; t Expedience showed .that^ime was pav^d and fir©cedui^_ simplified by endorsing the permit upon a skeleton Sh 1 p&gt;in and Cohen tffe Poo4 Control was merged with Customs, the system was stui further simplified by treating the skeleton Shipping Bill as the application for permission to export , x as indded it was Permission to export is not granted as a matter of routine; nor is any person entitled to export at his own option such option being in the Pood Controller. A trader having made a bargain on^the mainland can fill same by bringing the goods under mark RE, when suoh--cargo*~woul4~no-rmally go on^ to the &gt;*&lt; mainland and not be imported into Bahrain; hence local stocks are not affected by RE business. Two local Indian firms, Messrs uhamanmal Isardas, and hairidas Janimal (i.e. Mr Kakhumal) have branches on the mainland and are keen competitors. glause 3. ^©aif-e-Beervatienei© it should be explained that since the merchants’ muqquddams visit the Custom House daily on their general business, it was simplest to inform proposed exporters verbally whether or not their applications to export had been granted, ustoms documents, once lodged at the uustom House arp properly treated as private; and it is not the usual procedure to release them, especially when there is no necessity to do so* and it would oe strange to suppose that a proposed exporter does not xnow when he seeks permission to export, or that he has no record of his own business affairs. However, so that there may be no misunderstanding, it has been arranged that the triplicate coov 01 tne skeleton Shipping Bill shall oe returned in cases where an export is not sanctioned, with a suitable endorsement.d&gt; -his oeing understood, the Political gent’s observations ar* 3 accepted with the qualification that no trader is entitled to export Bahrain stocic at his own option. lause 4^ I'he occasion when Mr Kairhumal was refused sanction to export a quantity ol Mangalore coffee has already been explained in detail to the Political Agent in 1*0 :PA/PC/185/59 of the l'5th January, 1941 ( a copy of which is before you), the reason being that, in the i (, ood Controller s discretion, this trader s small stock did not justify the export. Clause 2_i In regard to the practical meaning of Article 3. of the Order, i would invite your attention to my memorandum to H.B.M’s Political Agent No:PA/PC/l83/39 of the 12th January 194i (_ a copy of which is before you;; and would add that I have discussed this with the former Food Controller who agrees with my opinion that local market prices in ahrain are not to be dependent on or vary according to local market prices in various parts oi India, as the effect of sucn dependence would be to increase the local Bahrain sale prices to the advantage ol such wealthier importers who could have accumulated larger stocks tnan poorer traders. It appears that this principle has been fully discussed at the meetings above referred to, wneu UlTwas agreed that the local maximum price must depend upon he prime cost ol the latest import and remain unchanged until sucn prime cost changed. •'his, of course is only logical; and it ensures a continuance or tne lower price as long as possible, lor the benefit of the consumer without loss to the importer. 'thus, ix is no more reasonaole to urge that the price 0 - ualiam nee should vary with the price of rangoon rice, or vice versa, than to urge that the price of oeef should vary with tne &gt;rice ol veal. mce the last fixation in the price of ballaix rice, there has been no change in its prime cost and, consequently, no need to change its local sale price, rhe same remark applies to rangoon rice and to zira rice; and, of course m each case the importer is assured of his fair profit when ne’ chooses to sell. -p 4 . should oe clearly understood that the interpretation Ox article 3. does not require that a price should oe changed evexy en days, out certainly that ix shall be checxed every ten days, or oftener if an import comes forward. For this purpose a Notice Board has been put at the Custom House giving ^e sale prices (in Arabic) ol all controlled commodities; and it is ordered that this list shall be revised every 1st 11th and 21sx of the month, and amended when a change m once developes. v ^ a x. , In connection, it is important that the Political ^ now an&lt;i - 7 ' r Kakhumal of course knows, although ne did not say so that the local merchants in 1939 expressed a wish that, since the Notice Board might be overlooked or for-' gotten, a circular notice should be issued mentioning any change m prices. fhis has been regularly done; and all the noted merchants duly endorse the Customs’ copy of every notice such recipients including the attendants at the meeting of the 28th December, 1939. Further notices are sent to the baladiahs of -.anamah, Maharaq, and Hedd and other public officials. -Jlguses 6. ,. d . Por the at)ovs reasons I submit that Mr Katthumal is simply quibbling about the effect of tne strict wording 0 r amai Articles 3. '-4., while it is Known that the practical worKing ox these clauses has gone beyond tne minimum requirements of ® sucn wording. It may be noted mat no complaints have come -rom other traders, all of whom are of course at liberty to express 'their views 'to me ab any 'time. „ .. 1 nave personally re-checKed all the local imports u . oa 9- anl rlce ex s. s.'Barpeta' v.285, (those two importers being Messrs Ratanchand Dipchand and Dhamanmal Isardas) and ex s.s. Bamora'v.29i» whose importers were: Messrs Abuulaziz Aly A1 Bassam 1.500 ba*^ ' Muhummad Sharif Awazi uqi f ‘ C. Dharamdas # „and I have conrirmed that all the prime costs were consistent, and no need arose to alter the fixed sale prices. Clause b. The point regarding tne delay in the fixation of prices on rice ex s. s.'’Bamora'' of 4-11-39 13 explained by the confusion in shipping conditions in India whicn resulted in mixed and varying consignments being shipped, and the delay m the mails bringing forward the relative invoices. A sale price cannot oe revised without the relative invoices from which the prime cost is ascertainable. Last week's visit of the extra steamer s.s. 'ITur Jehan M was to relieve the congestion in stocks at Karachi. Clause 8. For reasons shown above, I submit that the Political Agent's phrase: 'shOvJ.d regulate prices....with reference to 'the general trend of prices' is muoh too vague for practical working, as is also the wording of-Article 3.; and the system in practice at present is the only practical method of fixing the sale prices to give protection and fair p^y to the consumer with justice to the importer. The wording or the Order should oe adapted to the real conditions, and not vice versa. Nor is it reasonable to change the price of one kind of rice to follow variations in the price of another kind or rice. I deny that there is any unfair discrimination in favour of Messrs Dhamanmal Isardas; and I attribute this statement to competitive jealousy. Clause 9» I submit that the provisions of Article 3. of the ^ Food Control Order have been observed more fully than the strict, wording required; but at the same time I would be glad to have any practical suggestions for improving the present system which is working well, and, I believe, would be difficult to improve upon. It should oe rememoered that Bahrain is a small State where 'bureaucracy' is detested; and the simpler the official procedure, the greater the public confidence in its , public officials. Clause 10. I do not contest the statement of the Agency official; but I invite an inspection of the Notice Board at the Customs (remembering that all prices have previously been received by the concerned); and would add that since the prices of cotton and woollen piece goods mostly used by the poor (i.e. not luxury articles) were fixed in June last, there has been no necessity to alter them. ( se e addition below)^ Clause 11. It is correct that up to date no orders have been issued prescribing the accounts and records to be kept by the merchants under Article 8., the reason being that at the above meetings it was agreed that, since merchants keep their accounts which are always available for whe inspection when required by the Mejliss al Tujjara, to insist upon another set oi accounts would create extra work both for the merchants and als °° r •^ 00(i Controller, and probably entail the employment or additional accounts clerks, of whom, unfortunately, there are tew available locally. It is also true that the merchants are regularly submitting reports showing sales of commodities and stocks on hand; and, so far, these are found satisfactorily to meet our requirements. These reports and other relative documents are always keot under lock and key in the Customs; and it is not true to allege that the information therein has leaxed out. ^hirther, it is true that merchants are inclined to spy uoon one another jealously for the sake of competition; and it is extremely difxicult, if not impossible, to orevent one importer from observing the imports of another. Jince I regard all (ustoms documents as confidential 1 am extremely reluctant to publish records of stocks on hand’ as T lear that this would operate to the disadvantage of the smaller importer in his commercial enterprise. Such allegations are frequently made by jealous competitors. however if the Political Agent considers this point to be cogent, and’will approve, i propose to put the suggestion to the consideration o± the iiejliss al Tujjara and to be guided by their decision. Mr rumby reports to me that when the Government oi Bahrain considered the purchase of a large stock of rice* ■ to enable the former Food Controller to icnow the position of local stocics, he noted particulars of stocics and commitoients and passed this imormation to him. Local dealers were informed of tne govt's intention of purchasing through the agency of Messrs Dhamanmal isardas, the largest local dealers, and they were advised to suspend their imports, so tnat there should not oe a glut on the market. 1i is denied that they were ordered to suspend such imports; on the contrary there was no objection to their fulfilling their commit ments, as did Liessrs Handas Janimal and others, the difference being that Lhamanrnal isardas imported most of his commitments by one steamer, the s.s.'Warina', while naridas danimal took four months to fulfil what they claimed to have oeen their commitments. In this connection please refer to my No: PA/FC/7/501 ox 8-12-4o, a cony of which is before you. There was no reason why such slips should be saved, once they had served their purpose, as they were not official documents; but it is I am definitely assured that no one was asked to sign an undertaking not to import more rice until further orders; and, when in May last I recommended merchants to import more rice, I did not order them to do so, as naturally one would not direct a merchant ^in his private enterprise. Ordinary business sagacity would prevent an importer from cringing rice if he feared that he could not compete with the Government; but when such fear was removed, he would naturally resume his activities, and the point of fulfilling their commitments was originally raised by the merchants. J ONOLUSION : In conclusion, I would like it to be clearly understood that, while the Food Control system is wonting well, and is appreciated by the merchants, i appreciate constructive criticism which 1 treat as a helpful suggestion. Believe me, Yours sincerely, Addition When it was pointed out to the Political Agent (Mr H. ®ightman that cotton and woollen piece goods come forward in dozens oi different varying designs, textures, and values, it was .ecided that dealers should lodge pepiodieal&gt; price lists for examination, 3j.^._larly as is done in the case of provisions.Coffee kan&amp;alore Statement showing the imports of Coffee Mangalore by Messrs Haridas Janirapl &amp; Co for the year ***&amp; 1938 i.e.one season prior to the declaration of war. 17 Bags s.s .Bankura V .265 17 9 9 19 Bardda V. 292 . 21 1 9 9 9 Bexala V. 298 . 54 f 9 9 9 Bqmora V. 265 . 130 ) 9 9 9 Barala 7,^00. 197 • 2 9 9 9 Benkura V .269 18 Bags 3.3 •Bamora v .263 9 9 9 9 Benkura V .266 100 9 9 9 9 Ban dr a V .256 1^0 9 9 9 9 Bandra V.257 250 9 9 9 j Baroda V .295 40 9 9 9 9 Barpeta V.262 1025 Bags Total, It is to be pointed out that no individual, mere bant can claim to have imported more than the above quantity just a season before the declaration of war. /-N The main allegation about the Mangalore Coffee is that some merchants have been given the permission for export from local was as to what quantity each individual merchant has sold for _ * export and what quantity he has sold to local tarders. A comparative statement (from middle of March till day) showing the above figures of individual merchants has been awaaKat evaded which involves the real issue; as the rates for export are free while for local sales Jfche rates have been fixed at Rs.l9-S-0 (there has been a difference f Ps.4 to 6 per bag in the above sales). A statement showing the percentage basis of exports allowed (calculated on the stocks of individual merchants on the day of sanctioning the export ) has been shown which has no bearing on the matter. While the actual statement showing the percentage of sales for local and export of individuals has not been submitted. The rates of Mangalore Coffee* during the year 1940 were twice declared by controller on 26th February 1940 and 1.5th june 1940, It id an undisputed fact that the local demand for this coffee is very limited major portion of the stock is censur ed by Main- 1 and.Haturelly who were refused permission for export in March and April 1940 had no other go but to sell their coffee locallywhich is a self sufficient proof to show that there must be a clear loss to those stockists who were obliged to sell locally,due to absence of demand, after the declaration of rates on 1^.6.40. til ^ a — l-- im _ ~ — 11 m w — - nr ~ r — — ^ t, - r n- ~ ■ - _ i The special permit system as declared in Political Agent's Procalmation of 19.12.,59 been adopted.Coffee statement continued To give equality of treatment for exports from local cargo the whole stock Hjodunui is the main point for consideration and not the stocks of individuals on the day of sanctioning the export It is denied that Margin of 10^ was allowed only 5^ clear margin was agreed but the margin of profit has always been varying at nersonal discretion to heir the vested interests. The statement for the year 1940 of imports of coffee will show how the trade has been diverted from pre-war merchants to others* Specially those who were refused permission to export in the month of ^arch and April when there vas full season to import were naturally obliged to suspend their fresh orders as very little was consumed locally This is the main cause which has diverted the trade and given indirect monopoly for sales oft export to others who co-old freely import f»esh stocks being given in free hand* There has been no ban on export from India no# any difficu lty for transport and still permission to some was refused and at the same time to others was granted* This; led to the sales of export being the reserved monopoly of the so called highest stockists so created due to above tactics*Rice statement Continued sale, were announced by the Controller. Taking for granted tLc above figure?? to be accurate and after deducting the said 16000 /bags the net actual imoorts by Messrs Dhamamn&amp;l Issardar would cooje to ^4000/ bags only. Which is lower than our actual imports during the same period i,e. year 1939 * (4) The said lot of 16000/ bags was actually saleable in the year 1940 hence it is to be added to the imports of Messrs Dhamanmal Issardas for the year 1940 and not 1929 as shown in the stat ement and it was due to this lot that the import was banned by the Controller to avoid loss being suffered. (5) If seperate figures of Rangoon rice for the year 1940 are taken then till June not a single bag (except the unshipped stock of previous orders before 8th November 1929**** the day on which the ban on imports was put)has been imported by any merchant which is '\ue to ban on imports otherwise as a natural course when the rates hnd fallen down the merchants would have surely placed the oreders,Renee the monopoly has been enjoyed by one merchant*- f * ' / r f * H.B.M* e Political A^cnt Bahrain.

V- v&gt; In reference to your memorandum No:C/l01-l.a/48,B of the 29-1-41., I would state that when the Food Control was instituted, th-e dealers were classified into (a) Direct Importers, (b) Wholesale dealers, ?nd (c)-Retailers. Later, in order to prevent retailers from m?king an extra profit at the expense of the Local Wholesalers, it wi/as ordered that sales by Direct Importers should be in quantities of not fewer than ten bags, at a time. 2. ^ After conversations with the concerned, the Food Controller ru_ed that a fair rate of profit on sales would be: (a) for Direct Importers, five per cent; (b) for Local Wholesalers, four annas per bag; and (c) for retailers, five per cent; and it will be noticed that the’retriler has the gunny bag for re-sale, which is also worth a few annas. 3. On the 24th December, 1939, the maximum prices for Rangoon Rice were fixed at: (a) Direct Importers... not exceeding Rs:lO.0.0 per ba£ (b; Local Wholesalers, not exceeding ' 10.4.0 ” “ (c) Retailers, .... ” ' Rs:3.9.0 per maund.* The rice sold under this order was, mainly, Government stock. 4. In June, 1940, as local stocxs were becoming low, the Food Controller rdvised a meeting of eleven (out of fifteen expected;, local merchants to resume their imports of Rangoon rice. Of these, nine merchants undertake to import, but with considerable reluctance, owing to; (a) it was expected that prices would steadily fall; and th^wcefore an early importer might face loss; (b) the sinking of s.s. ”pathan'» , (believed to be by enemy action; in Bombay waters, and the closing of the ports of Bombay and Rangoon temporarily, and the recall of two B.I.3.N.Coy’s steamers, created nervousness about security of delivery here; and (c) it was generally agreed that the above sanctioned margin of^brofit was too low, and ought to be douoled. Point (c) was discussed by the Food Controller with the Political Agent and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, ; nd was accepted. 5. On 22nd July the following rates were fixed: (a; Direct Importers, not exceeding Rs:12.0.0 per bag; (b; Local 'Tholesalers ' ” 12.4.0 ' (c ; Retailers . . . . ' ' 4.8.0 per maund.

We request that if the said Head Clerk is allowed to go on leave and our matter remains pending we shall have to suffer hence Your Honor will be pleased to do the needful whereby our cause may not suffer.

After compliments, We, the undersigned, have come on behalf of ourselves and on behalf of af all fruit and vegetable sellers to put our §&gt;*****» grievances before the Political Agert, and pray that he may be pleased to have them removed. had appointed a corrupt person, Yusuf bin Abdulla Loori since 6 or 7 years as tax collector of the fruit and vegetable market. This man who is doing all sorts of corrupt acts, at our expense, is reputedly doing all these acts at the instructions, and for the private gain of the Secretary. Since he was appointed we have been so much harrassed by him that we had to curtail our imports and restrict our business, and as a result there is always a shortage of fruits and vegetables and consequently had to sell at high prices. He controls our sales and purchases and does not allow a whole sale dealer to sell to the person who pays more but compels him to sell at a much lower price than others offer to the persons who agree to act as his partners and pay him half of the profit when the fruits are auctioned at a much higher bid. In other instances, when lots are to be auctioned he demands bribes of Rs.5 or Rs.10 from the seller and if he does not pay him he would delay his goods for a day or two until some of them rot. He creates disagreements between buyers and sellers so that he may extract bribes from both sides for mediating between them. If one refuses to fall for his suggestions and to satisfy his demands he would ruin his credit with other dealers by false stories about his finances and by threatening some of those who allow him credit. Some of the fruits left by us in the Baladiyah godowns, the keys of which are kept by him, are often partly stolen by him, and we have brought complaints against him to the Secretary beforei#hfrm we proved the thefts by producing witnesses but the Secretary turned us av/ay and did nothing in the matter-. He issues receipts scribbled in pencil on pieces of waste paper which are undated and do not contain full particulars and often demands a tax for a second time without these receipts holding good because there are no date and particulars on them.

Mr. Kakoomal made certain allegations against specific persons and said he wanted full liberty for proving these allega tions. Would you kindly discuss this case with me at an early date ? Captain M.G.Dixon, Assistant Political ^ Agent, Bahrain •Due to control and restrictions on export our trade has been greatly hampered and our Pre-war activities have been stopped and we are the hardest hit. if the Pre-war figures of the last 8 or 10 years are taken it will be clear that our firm was the first importer for Bahrain• Due to no restrictions on rates for sale of export goods, there is a good margin of profit thereon. The permits for export from local cargo has been made matter of personal discretion, if the figures of last three months of export from Bahrain are taken specially of tea end sugar it will be clear how the trade is being indirectly monopolized by one party while the others are suffering. if this matter is thoroughly investigated impartially it will prove a lot of other things which it is not advisable to disclose at this juncture • The whole of the Arabian side of the Persian Dulf ports is full of foodstuffs while here in Bahrain not a single mer chant has got any rice in stock for which reason may be enquired and taken into consideration. The monthly requirement of Bahrain has been shown as 6000 bags rice and 2000 bags flour. This estimate is not only misguiding but has been done to achieve personal gains and this has been the chief cause of the general public complaint. The reduction in ration of 12 lbs.and 4 lbs.flour has upset the whole Buhrain, specially the floUr would work to 2 oz. a day and will naturally lead to malpractices among the retailers and will as well cause much trouble hereafter as necessity is the mother of invention. The control work should be in the hands of one who may have no connection with any merchant. Here if the matter is properly enquired into all the relevant facts will be clear. Much misrepresentation to the higher authorities is going on and actual charge is in the hams of one who has made the present control system a matter of personal discretion whereby the whole trade is being diverted from Ire-war mer chants and traders who are the real sufferers while favourite are enjoying. The merchants and traders are so much terrified that none would! dare utter a word and give evidence even of actual facts as they know that not only they will be disreputed but will be ruined as their trade will be totally stopped as now-a-days the traders are solely dependent on the permits from the Food Controller which is a question for their very existence. After my statement to the Adviser contradicting to the monthly requirement of 6000 bags rice and 2000 bags flour with facts and figures whereby the general public opinion Trias created a very bad impression oi the sponsors of the scheme and has degraded them sitice every possible effort is being made to put our firm as revenge into trouble. if the natter is enquired into independently of the Control department quite sufficient proofs in support of the above and many other revelations will come to light which otherwise will be exposed provided full opportunities are given by impartial access to records -which will throw light on the /ac tual11. 3very effort is beir^ made to get all the orders through Bahrain Government of fooustuffs to one firm which is be in D made exception to the standing orders in certain cases to give the said firm undue advantage over other merchants, 12. Whether any of the staff of the Control department has ary connection with the said firm is a matter of very careful investigation. Besides there are many other allegations which cannot be put into writing as none will dare give direct eviuence for the reasons mentioned above.V r&gt;. m -ir, Before intruding upon your precious time, I bey to submit that only very difficult circumstances have prompted me to approach your honour uitb the sanguine hope that you will very kindly look into the matter and help us in retting out of the difficulty. 1 ir, our firm imported into Bahrain 175 bags of Buga r arrived per s.s. 'Asian** on 14-3-42 (i.e. about 5 months back; but I regret to say that up to now no rate has been fixed by the ?ood Controller for sale. It means we cannot sell the Sugt r and, consequently, our money is tied up. T have c. lied on the od Controller many times and requested him to fix the rate, but nothing has been done a 3 y^t, although according to your Orders, the r-te is to c° fixed within 5 days or the maximum ID days after the arrival of goods at Bahrain. Cir, had the authorities concerne ' been goo ; enough to fix; th® price in time, m would have by this time been eble to make a turn over of the business at least three to four times on the .same investment. Besides, we have been put to loss in respect of godown rent, interest, tare &amp; v.a r ® by rats and also have been greatly inconvenienced owing to the money being tied up. Above all, r ir, the price of Cugar ha; since gone up from i-. 19-4-0 per Cwt.

I.:»s Political Agent, Bahrain. MQmorandum: - Reference your printed Letter No. ^2^42 dated 13tn October, 1942, enclosing a letter from Gover- dhandas Dharamdas. I have made enquiries about the matter from the Director of Customs. I understand that the letter is from a clerk in the firm’s office, not from the Principal who is out of Bahrain at present. Narly in 1942, Goverdhandas Dharamdas, who does not normally deal in sugar, purchased 175 bags of sugar in Karachi as a speculation at a time when prices were fluctuating and the cost was very high. He imported the sugar into Bahrain and its cost at the time was higher than the controlled price, if the contol price had been raised to fall into line with this import all the sugar in the bazaar would have had to be sold at a higher price. The Director of Customs theieTore offered to buy the 175 bags of sugar paying 7-^ more than the prime cost. This offer was refused and the sugar remained unsold but if the importer is now willing to dispose of thu sugar the Bahrain Government is willing to make the same offer as was made before. Aov iser t,o the Government.f HQ.C/1687 To Political Agency, Bahrain, the 5th November 1942 Messrs. Goverdhandaa Dharamdaa, Bahrain. Memorandum Reference your application dated 28th September 1942 about the 175 bags of sugar which you have lying in stock with you. The Bahrain Government, through the Food Controller, offered to buy the sugar from you at above the prime cost. This offer, I am informed, was refused by you, though in my opinion it was a reasonable one and in consonance with the Government policy of discouraging speculation or profiteering in essential foodstuffs. The Bahrain Government now repeat their offer to purchase the sugar at ?%% above the prime cost. If you had accepted this offer when the sugar was imported your capital would not have been left idle, the sugar would not have been damaged by 'wear and tear', and you would not have had tofain.

The price in Bahrain was Rs. 45/— and the Bahrain Government refused to buy the sugar from him and refused him permission to sell it in Bahrain at more than Rs.45/-. He was given permission to export it to Saudi Arabia but he did not ship it as he had already had stocks there. When stocks of sugar in Bahrain were diminishing he offered to sell to the Bahrain Government 150 bags of sugar at the controlled rate provided he was given permission to export the remaining 221 bags. This was granted. Messrs. Goverdhandas Dharamdas had 175 bags of sugar which cost him Rs.57/- a bag. On 18th January 1943 he oifered to sell to the Food Controller 100 bags of their sugar at controlled price and asked for permission to export to foreign ports the remaining 75 bags. This request was granted and I understand that he shipped the 75 bags of sugar on the 21st January 1943. Sncl....

The commodities discussed include (Rangooni) rice, Mangalore coffee, fruit and vegetables, and sugar.The Persian language content of the file consists of a petition (with English translation), dated 27 May 1944, on folio 119.The covering dates of the main run of correspondence (folios 2-113) are 3 October 1940 - 26 January 1943.
