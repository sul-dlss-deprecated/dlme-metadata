Jacob also discusses his fears that all his hard work of the last twenty years on the frontier is being deliberately undone by the Government.The letter concludes by discussing the need for William Merewether to return to England for his health and Jacob's desire to retire once the situation in Beloochistan is resolved.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024079755.0x000008#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
