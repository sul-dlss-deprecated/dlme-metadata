Hennell states that the principal object for which a squadron is maintained in these seas is the suppression of piracy and maritime disorder. In the margin he provides a list of members of the maritime truce and states that no hostilities of any kind are to be permitted between their vessels. The members of the truce are listed as follows: Sheik Sultan ben Suggur [Sulṭān bin Saqr Āl Qāsimī] of Ruselkhyma [Ra's-al-Khaymah]; Sheik Abdoollah ben Rashid [Sheikh Abdullah I bin Rashid Al Mu`alla] of Amulgavine [Umm al-Qaywayn]; Sheik Abdool Azeez ben Rashid [Sheikh `Abd al–`Aziz I ibn Rashid Al Nuaimi] of Ejmaun [Ajman]; Sheik Muckhtoom ben Bulye [Sheikh Maktoum bin Butti bin Sohal] of Debaye [Dubai]; and Sheik Saeed ben Tahnoon [Sheikh Said bin Tahnun Al Nahayan] of Aboothabee [Abu Dhabi].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023711592.0x000010#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
