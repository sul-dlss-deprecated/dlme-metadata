Confidential . NOTE M Lieutenant Oolone l t ,C. Fowle. G3E , KUWAIT AN D QATAR OTI, . ^en travelling irom Bush ire to Kuwait the other day, I haa a long conversation with Haji Williamson 01 the A«?.0.J. Being a Moslem, and, unlike most ''converts', oeing trusted 'by his fellow M)hammedans, he is in a position to gauge local Moslem opinion fairly correctly. I was careful to avoid expressing my own opinion ana let him talk, which he was quite willing to do. 2. On the subject of Kuwaiti Oil he was definitely of opinion that Major Holmes was the nigger in the wood pile, and lor his own ends had assisted the Sheikh to stick out for high terms from the K.O»C. He said that the Sheikh would never have adopted such a stiff attitude towards the Company unless he had heen instigated thereto hy Major Holmes. c^tar Oil, He, Haji Williamson, had gone to Qatar with Mr. Utiles of the A.P.O.C. on his recent visit to the Sheikh, ana on the whole was rather lavourahly impressed with the Sheikh's attitude, which haa improved since the last visit of the a.P.0,0, reprebentatives last year. He thought that the policy of leaving the sheikh alone, and so giving the impression that the Company were not running after him to get the concession, had been successful. He was under the impression that there were some hopes, though, of course, he could not commit himself in any way definitely, that at the end of the new option period/(') V / - 2 - perioa the Sheikh might oe willing to abate his terms. He said that he had heara indirectly that Ibn Saud's stock had somewhat gone down with the Sheikh, as a consequence of the evacuation of Hoaeida and the Yemen Littoral without apparently payment of any subsidy on the part of the Imam. The Sheikh of Kuwait, in the course of casual conversation with me a day or two later, also expressed the opinion that the final result of the Saudi-Yemeni war was not regarded by the Arabs of the Gulf as by any means too successful from Ibn Saud's point of view.

I think that the Admiralty were going to consider the suggestion which Mr. Agnew then made. Could you let us have the views of the Admiralty on the subject and on the draft clauses enclosed with Hearn 1 s letter?

' ■■VriBHITAMIC HOUSE, FINSBURY CIRCUS LONDON. E.G.2. llth July, 1934. Dear Walton, QATAR . You are, I think, faxailiar with the steps we have recently taken to send Mr. Mylles to Qatar with the object of renewing the option period for 6 months, or possibly more. It will not be possible, for various reasons, to open up concession negotiations with the Shaikh for several months, but my recollection is that we are generally agreed with the India Office, etc. respecting the character of the two Agreements (Government and Company) which will govern the negotiations. However, I suggest it will be desirable that we should have one meeting at the India Office, after the leave season, when we can be quite sure that we are keeping step. There is one point arising out of our last meeting on which I think it desirable to write you: I am referring to the clause respecting ! refining' in the Government Agreement. You may remember that at the discussion in the India Office, at which Mr. Agnew was present, he expressed dislike for the wording of the Refining Clause as it appears in the Kuwait Political Agreement and suggested another method of meeting the situation. However, at a discussion I recently had with him, in which he learnt that the Kuwait Political Agreement would not be published to the world, or referred to in the Commercial Agreement, he agreed that, subject to the same procedure being followed in the case of Qatar/ Walton, Esq., C.B., M.C., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.I. , 4596/34.Qatar, he would no longer object to accepting the precise v/ording of the Kuwait Clause 10. Alternatively, and arising out of the views he expressed at the meeting at the India Office, he has prepared a new draft clause which he would be equally willing to accept, I enclose herewith a copy of the alternative drafts Speaking for my own side, I am prepared to accept either the original Kuwait draft or that proposed by Mr. Agnew, although, personally, I would prefer, for the sake of uniformity, to stand by the drafting as it appears in the Kuwait Agreement. However, we leave it to you to choose the one which is preferred from your point of view. Yours sincerely, (Sgd) A.G. Hearn. P.S. A copy of this letter has been sent to Mr. Starling.Q. A T A R . 'The Company declare that it is their intention, should they consider that commercial conditions justify it, to erect a refinery at Qatar. If and when the Company is satisfied that commercial production is assured, the Company agrees to examine with His Majesty's Government the question of establishing a refinery in Qatar of suitable type and capacity.' MR. AGNEw 1 S DRAFT . 'If this Company should itself, or through a subsidiary Company, hold a concession covering the State of Qatar, and if a petroleum production is reached of a quantity equal to the capacity of one modern refining unit, the Company will undertake to consider with H.M. Government the question of the erection of a refinery within the state of Qatar, either by itself, or through a subsidiary Company. In giving consideration to the question of a refinery, physical conditions, as well as the possibilities which may then exist for the marketing of refined petroleum products, will be given due weight'.BRITAKNIC HOUSE, FINSBURY CIRCUS, LONDON. E.C.2. 18th July, 1934. Dear Mr. Walton, Q. A T A R . Further to iny letter of the 11th July, Mr. Mylles has now succeeded in obtaining an extension of our agreement with the Shaikh over a period of eight months from 6th August, This, of course, greatly relieves the tension. Having regard to our experience in guwait, we feel that it would he very desirable for all 'political' matters to be settled between the Governments political representatives and the Shaikh before our negotiator appears on the scene. If you concur in this view, we can, no douot, arrive at a mutually satisfactory time-table for the future. As I remarked in my previous letter, I suggest it would be desirable to have another meeting at the India Oo-iice in order to settle all outstanding points. They are not considerable. If you will let me imov; one or more dates which are convenient to you and your colleagues, we will make arrangements accordingly, Ix it can be arranged for the near future, so much the better.

We are consulting the Admiralty about this and will let you know the result in due course. I have also to acknowledge your letter of 18th July about the procedure and time table to be followed with the Sheikh of Qatar. I shall be writing to you separately about this. It is good news that Mr.Mylles has succeeded in obtaining an extension of your present agreement for eight months from 6th August. Yours since^Giy* iSd.) J. C. WALTON.

Jear Hearn, I write with further reference to your letter of 18th July to ./alt on, who is on leave, about ^atar Oil to say that we understand from Fowle that he has now discussed with you in detail the question of procedure and that in t'.e light of his views you are now prepared to adopt the Seine procedure in Q,atar as in the case of Kuweit, viz: to enter into a political rgreement with His Majesty 's Government on the same general l^nes as m Kuweit, and thereafter to proceed with comm ercial negotiations with the Shaikh. The political agreement would in due course be disclosed to the Shaikh, but not oecess- arily in the early stage of the commerical negotiations. .'e feel strongly ourselves that this is the right course to adopt, and we are glad to understand that the company now feel the same. 2. &gt;/e suggest that the meeting on outstanding points in the political agreement might ta ^e place once we have the views of t-.e Admiralty about refining. I hope that these will not now be long delayed.. Yours, &amp;c.. (Sgd) J.G.LAITH ^AITL. G.

At beginning ol the rule of Shaikk-Shakkbut bin Sultan over Abu i^habi he was lenient in paving the Sakah in the same {/v/vvX tA, ttTi manner as used to be paid at the^two previous Shaikhs namely when the Muzakki reached the Al Bainaun^on tne western sine of Dhatran ana coiiectea tne Zakan from ihe tribesmen wno were at AJ.

The reason lor not insisting on getting the ZaKah is that in the year 1349 a fight took place between the ti-ioes ol Bam Yas / namely the Hawamil and the men ol toe Amir ci ^asa, Muhammad as-Sanali and his lollowers. The said men lad severe beating and tne lour tribes did not pay Zaican, incluaing some ol the 'nasir who were on the southern springs.The tribesmen 01 ®ani ^as complained to Simikh Snaicnbut bin Sultan and Lhe said ^haiidi wrote ^o the Amir ol ^asa about the matier.

The Wahabi Amirs and Ibn Saud : their Relations with Eastern Arabia and with the British Government, 1800 to 1934. The difficulties which have recently arisen in connection with the eastern boundary of the Saudi Kingdom, the claims advanced by Ibn Sand to ancestral rights east of the Blue Line laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913, and the suggestions put forward by him that at some period in the past arrange ments were entered into with his ancestors, the Wahabi Amirs, by the representatives of H.M. Government, which afforded some recognition of those claims, have made it desirable to examine in some detail the history since 1800 of the connection of the Wahabi power with the Trucial Sheikhdoms and their hinterland and with Muscat; the relations between H.M. Government and the Wahabi Amirs and Ibn Saud himself; and tinally the extent to which either the Wahabi Amirs or Ibn Saud in the pre-war period can properly be regarded as Turkish vassals or have admitted or claimed Ottoman nationality. 2. The period to be covered falls into the following sections :— (1) 1745 to 1800.—First development of the Wahabi sect. (2) 1800 to 1870-71.—From the first expansion of the Wahabis in Eastern Arabia to the fall of Baraimi and the Turkish occupation of Hasa. (3) 1871 to 1901.—From the Turkish occupation of Hasa to the capture of Riyadh by Ibn Saud. (4) 1901 to 1914.—From the capture of Riyadh to the outbreak of the Great War. (5) 1914 to 1934.—From the outbreak of the Great War to the opening of the Blue Line discussions. I.—Rise and Development of the Wahabi Power, 1745 to 1800. Origin of the Wahabi Sect. 3. It is unnecessary to examine in detail the sources and early history of the Wahabi movement. The sect appears to have been founded by Abdul Wahab and his son, Mohamed Ibn Abdul Wahab, in the early part of the eighteenth century in Nejd, and to have advocated a return to the primitive simplicity which prevailed among the early followers of Islam in the lifetime of the Prophet. The founders of the sect connected themselves with the Sheikhs of the Saudi family, who then ruled at Deriyah in Nejd ; and the movement, originally religious in character, rapidly assumed a political complexion. The Saudi Sheikhs, with the assistance of the impetus given them by the Wahabi movement, rapidly extended their local influence under the Amir Mohamed, who ruled from 1745 to 1765, at the expense first of the neighbouring rulers of Riyadh and then of the Beni Khalid, who had, since the middle of the seventeenth century, been the principal tribe in Hasa. 4. The first Wahabi Amir died in 1765 and was succeeded by his son, Abdul Aziz, who ruled till his assassination in October or November of 1803. Riyadh was captured in 1772 and the whole of Nejd came under Wahabi rule. The province of Hasa was subdued for the first time in 1792 and finally in 1795, and the power of the Beni Khalid broken. Attempts by the Ottoman Government to re-establish its control failed, and a truce for six years, under which the W ahabis remained in possession of Hasa, was concluded in 1799. The Political Situation in Arabia in 1800. \\ ith the conquest of Hasa the Saudis commenced to turn their attention to the east and south. The occasion is a convenient one briefly to review the political situation in Arabia in the year 1800. It was as follows :— . Furkey held Iraq; exercised what appears to have been a controlling influence in Koweit, and maintained a claim to tiasa and its ports. The llejaz was a so held by a Turkish vassal, the Sherif of Mecca.Lor. I, 769- 90. Lor. I. 421. Lor. I, 429. 7. The Wahahi Amirs held Hasa and Nejd. 8. Bahrein was in the possession of the Uttabi Sheikhs, who, originally settled on the mainland of Arabia at Zubarah in Qatar, had expelled the loisums iroin Bahrein in 1783. The Bahreini Sheikhs, apprehensive of attack by Muscat, had in 1799 made overtures to Persia and paid her tribute. In 1800 they weie tempoiarily subdued by Muscat. 9. Qatar. —The Uttabi Sheikhs of Bahrein had hereditary possessions in Qatar, and took refuge there on their expulsion from the islands by Muscat in 1800. 10. The present-day Trneial Coast, then known as the Pirate Coast, was ruled by Arab Sheikhs, the ancestors of the present Trucial Sheikhs. Of these Sheikhs, only two were of real importance, the Beni Yas Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and the rival Jowasimi Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah, whose capital was later removed to Shargah. These rulers were separated by a secular enmity, and belonged to the opposing religious factions of the Hinawi and the Ghafari. I he iacl that the Kulers ol Muscat! also belonged to the Hinawi faction formed a link between Muscat and Abu Dhabi. The Sheikhs of the Pirate Coast held a fringe of varying depth along the coast but do not appear to have exercised any real influence in the remoter hinterland, which w T as in the possession of Bedouin tribes. 11. At the eastern end of Arabia was the independent Sultanate of Muscat, at this time ruled by the able and vigorous Saiyid Sultan, who succeeded in 1 792, and who had in 1794 extorted a lease of Bunder Abbas and its dependencies fiom Persia. The Sultan had in 1798 entered into an alliance with the British Govern ment and had in 1800 agreed to receive a British Political Representative. In the same year he succeeded in establishing his dominion over Bahrein. 12. The British Government, represented by the Government of India and the Government of Bombay, were closely associated with Gulf affairs loi commercial reasons, but their policy in 1800 and until late in the nineteenth century was essentially to restrict their activities on the Arab littoral of the I eisian Gulf to the minimum necessary to secure the security of the seas and freedom loi British and Indian commerce. They were consistently extremely reluctant to involve themselves in any way in the affairs of the hinterland, save to the extent necessary to secure these objects. As will be seen from the statement which follows, they were anxious in these circumstances to observe strict neutrality towards the W ahabis and to abstain from involving themselves in difficulties with this new and considerabe mainland Power. II.—1800--1871. From the first expansion of the Wahabis in Eastern Arabia to the Conquest of Hasa by the Turks. 1800 to the Death of Amir Abdul Aziz in O ctober —November 1803. First Wahahi Encroachment in Eastern Arabia. 13. In 1800 the Wahabis for the first time turned their attention to Eastern Arabia. In that year a Wahabi expedition invaded Oman and occupied the oasis of Barairni—a strategic point of the first importance commanding the approaches o Muscat. In 1801 the Sultan of Muscat was forced by the Uttabi Sheikhs to abaiidon Bahrein. In 1802 a fresh attack on Bahrein by Muscat was repulsed with WahaDi assistance, but thereafter with brief intervals Bahrein remained unclei a a ! influence till 1811, tendered tribute to the Wahabis in 1803, and afforded uava assistance to them against Muscat in 1805. By 1802 the whole coast from to the boundary between Muscat and Shargah at Diba had been reduced to nonllU , a , Selections submission, and in 1803 the Sultan of Muscat was forced to conclude a t nice ul XXIV, 303, the Wahabis, under which Muscat agreed to pay zakat to them, and to allow 429. Wahabi representative to reside at Muscat. Lor. I, 842. Bombay Selections The Wahabis in Western Arabia, 1800-1804. 14. In Western Arabia in the meantime the \\ ahabis had captured and destioye Kerbela, and had in 1802 decisively defeated a punitive expedition sent them by the Turks. Their control of Hasa and Nejd was now complete. . 111 f, 1803 they overran the Hejaz and completed the conquest of the Turkish dis rl . Lor. I, 1054, on the Red Sea littoral.

Between 1801 and 1814 the Wahabis consolidated their influence in Trucial Oman, delivered repeated attacks on the Sultan of Muscat, and for the first time came into contact with the British Government. Between 1814 and 1818 they succumbed to the attacks of the Egyptians and their power temporarily ended. It will be most convenient to deal with their relations with the various sections of the Arab littoral seriatim. Muscat and the Waiiabis, 1804-1818. 10. Saiyid Sultan died in 1804, and the Wahabis took an active share in the disputes which followed about the succession. Saiyid Badr, to whom they lent their support, was finally elected Sultan in 1805. 1 he new Sultan, who in 1806 co-operated Lor. I, 107G. with the British expedition against the Jowasimi pirates (paragraph 24 below), ruled the Sultanate till his assassination by Said bin Sultan in 1807. Said bin Sultan, who was to rule till 1856, was hostile to Wahabi influence, although he continued Lor. I, 1075, to allow a Wahabi Political Agent to reside at Muscat, and in 1809 he conducted ^42. au abortive expedition against the new Wahabi Sheikh of the Jowasimis. In the same year the Wahabis delivered a successful attack upon the Sultan from Baraimi, aud the punitive expedition sent in 1809 by the Government of India against the Jowasimi pirates (paragraph 25 below) had as an incidental object the easing of the pressure on the Sultan. In L810-11, on the withdrawal of the British expedition, further successful attacks were made from Baraimi by Syed bin Mutlak, the Wahabi lieutenant there, in face of which the Sultan appealed, but unsuccessfully, to the Government of India for assistance. These attacks in 1812-13 penetrated to the south-east of Muscat at Sur and Jaalan; and in the latter place the Beni bu Ali tribe were permanently converted to Wahabism. In 1811 Bahrein was freed from Wahabi rule by the Sultan of Muscat, who inflicted a severe defeat on the Wahabis in Qatar in 1812. In 1813 the Sultan endeavoured to co-operate with the Lor. 1,445. Egyptians, who were now massing for their attack upon Nejd. A Wahabi attack from Baraimi again, however, led to his temporary submission and to the payment of a large fine. The increasing pressure of the Egyptians on the Wahabis appears now to have led to a diminution of Wahabi activity in eastern Arabia ; with the death of the Amir Saud in 1814 all further danger ceased by land, and from that date to the fall of the Wahabi power in 1818 little is heard of them in connection with Muscat, although in 1816 the Wahabis assisted the Sheikh of Bahrein to repel an attempt by the Sultan to re-establish his control over Bahrein. Trugial Oman and the Wahabis, 1804-1818. 17. During most of the period from 1800 to 1814 the Wahabis appear to have held a dominating position in Trucial Oman and its hinterland. Their Agent established himself in 1800 in the oasis of Baraimi, which he fortified and used as a base for attacks on Muscat or for bringing pressure on the Trucial Sheikhs, hi 1803 the Jowasimi of Ras-al-Khaimah were compelled to co-operate in a Wahabi attack on Muscat; but in 1806 a British punitive expedition sent against the Lor. I 105 7, Jowasimis ignored the Wahabi connection with them, and a convention concluded 1074. with the Jowasimis in that year was concluded without reference to the Wahabi Amir and without protest from him. In 1808 Sultan bin Suggar, the hereditary chief of the -lowasimi Arabs at Ras-al-Khaimah, was deposed by the Wahabis, and in ml 6 year a Wahabi nominee, the Sheikh of Rams, was substituted for him. J-he fallen Jowasimi chief was subsequently lured to Nejd and there imprisoned, but he escaped and returned through the Yemen to Muscat bearing overtures to the Sultan from the Pasha of Egypt for co-operation against the Wahabis. In Lor. 1,1075, IoO ( J the Jowasimi responded to a Wahabi request for co-operation against Koweit, though nothing seems to have come of this. oi Pirac y broke out in an aggravated form after the deposition of the Jowasimi leikh of Ras-al-Khaimah and a further British expedition, with which Muscat co-operated, was sent in 1809 -10 which reduced the pirates to submission. The a ha hi Agent at Baraimi is alleged to have proceeded to the assistance of as al-Khaimah ; but, if he did so, he did not arrive until after the departure of the 3076 B i i i4 Lor. 1,1076. punitive expedition. Shinas, which was held by a Wababi Governor, was also forced to surrender. The Government of India, anxious to avoid involving them selves in any way with the Wahabis, turned a blind eye so far as possible to Wahabi responsibility (as to the degree of which there is room for difference of opinion) for the activities of the pirates and gave stringent instructions to the Political Resident to avoid involving himself in any way with the W ahabi power. 19. The Wahabi Lieutenant in Baraimi, Syed bin Mutlak, proceeded to Nejd in 1813, whereupon his successor, Tbn Azdakah, was murdered by the Beni Yas of Dhafrah. On Syed bin Mutlak's return later in the same year, he was himself Lor. 1,445, killed in action against the Hajriyin of Oman, and was succeeded by Ibn Mazru. 650-1, 1076. j n 1 ^13^ an d again in 1814, the Beni Yas Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who appears to have been more independent of Wahabi influence than the Jowasimis, on two occasions combined with Muscat against the \\ aha bis. In the autumn of 1814 the Wahabi Amir associated himself with explanations Lor. 1, 652. and assurances furnished by the de facto Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaima to tue Resident in regard to the piracies of the Jowasimis, consequent on which a preliminary agreement, immediately violated by the Jowasimis, was reached in October 1814. Bahrein and the Wahabis, 1804-1818. 20. The Wahabis assisted the Sheikhs to regain possession of Bahrein from Muscat in 1801, but the islands thereupon came under the influence of the Wahabi Amir, to whom they offered tribute in 1803, and with whom they co-operated in that year and again in 1805 against Muscat. The Government of Bombay in 1805 gave no encouragement to suggestions from the Sheikhs for material assistance to Lor. 1,842-3 enable Bahrein to withhold her support from the W T ahabis, under whose control they remained until 1811, when, with the assistance of Muscat, they again regained their independence. The Sultan of Muscat subsequently claimed that Bahrein had then accepted a liability to pay tribute to him, and in 1816 he made an attack Lor. 1, 844. U p 0n the islands which^ thanks to the assistance of the Wahabis, with whom and with the Jowasimis the Sheikhs now again allied themselves, was, however, unsuccessful. Lor. I. 1007-8. Koweit and the Wahabis, 1804-1818. 21. In 1803 Koweit, like the rest of the coast, was under Wahabi control, and in that year it assisted the Wahabi Amir in an expedition against Muscat. In 1805 the Sheikh described himself as subject to the Wahabis. But by 1808 Koweit was strong enough to decline to respond to a further appeal for assistance; a Wahabi attack was driven off in 1809, and the Sheikh of Koweit appears thenceforward to have remained relatively free of Wahabi influence. Qatar and the Wahabis, 1804-1818. Lor. 1, 791. 22. Wahabism was dominant in Qatar between 1809-11, but the Wahabis were expelled by Muscat in the latter year and the authority of Bahrein re-established. In 1816, however, Sheikh Rahmah bin Jabir of Khor Hassan and Damman sided with Muscat against the Wahabis and the Sheikh of Bahrein. Turkey and the Wahabis; 1804 to the Destruction of the Wahabi Power in 1818. Lor. 1,1069. 23. In 1804 Mehemet Ali was appointed Viceroy of Egypt, chiefly in order that he might recover the Hejaz for Turkey. From 1804 to 1810 he concerted his plans for achieving this object. Between 1810 and 1815 he reconquered the Hejaz and drove the Wahabi Amirs back into Nejd. In 1815 his lieutenants advanced into Qasim, and later in the year the Wahabis were severely defeated, submitted to Tusun Pasha, and sent hostages to Egypt. But the Egyptian Viceroy refused to ratify the understanding reached, and w T as content with nothing less than the complete subjection of the Wahabi Amirs. x \n offer to accept an Egyptian Governor of Nejd and to pay tribute was rejected ; Deriyah was invested, reduced and destroyed in September 1818 ; and the Wahabi Amir was taken prisoner, sent to Cairo, and executed at Constantinople. His four brothers were sent to Cairo as prisoners. The Wahabi power was, for the time being, completely destroyed, and Turkish (or rather Egyptian) control re-established over Nejd, Hasa, and the Hasa coastal area in the Persian Gulf.Wauabi Relations with H.M. Government, 1800-1818. 24. The first relations of H M. Government (as represented by the Government of India and the Government of Bombay) with the Wahabi Amirs date from ]805. The Wahabis had reached the sea coast with the conquest of Hasa in 1795, and had subsequently extended their control along the Trucial Coast between 1800 and 1803. The piratical activities of the Trncial Sheikhs (responsibility for which was in some quarters ascribed to the Wahabis) led in 1806 to a British punitive expedition against them. The expedition subdued the Jowasimis and concluded a treaty with their chief. Despite the fact tiiat the Wahabis were suspected of being the moving force behind the activities of the Jowasimis, the instructions given to the Resident were to refrain from proceedings which might be displeasing to the Wahabi Amir. But it is noteworthy that the treaty concluded with the Jowasimis in 1806 was concluded with them as independent Sheikhs and without reference to, or the interference of, the Amir. Punitive Expedition against the Jowasimis of 1809-181 (J. 25. Further outbreaks of piracy, both before and after the removal of the Jowasimi chief by the Wahabis and the substitution of a Wahabi vicegerent, led to a combined expedition against the Jowasimis by Great Britain and Muscat in 1808-10. The expedition succeeded in its objects, but it was conducted with a Nejd Precis degree of caution and forbearance towards the Wahabis, probably now, as § previously, the real motive force behind the pirates, which rendered its results of little permanent value. The instructions given to the Resident were that he should 'be careful to make it in due time fully known to the Wahabi and all the officers of his Government that it was our sincere wish to continue at all times on terms of friendship with him and the other States of Arabia, desiring only to provide for the security of the general commerce of the seas, and of the Gulf of Persia in particular, so long and so unjustifiably interrupted by the Jowasimis, in breach also of a positive treaty concluded with their Chief in 1806. . . . The just support of our ally, the Imam of Muscat, cannot reasonably give offence to any other State or Government.' (Correspondence with the Wahahi Amir, 1810. 26. The Wahabi Amir having in 1810 entered into correspondence with the Political Resident at Bushire, in regard to the punitive operations which had been undertaken against the Jowasimis, in which he expressed his desire to maintain Nejd Precis relations of amity and concord with 11.M. Government, the Government of Bombay, § 25. addressed him in the following terms (letter from the Honourable Mr. Duncan dated 9th August 1810):—' The British Government receives with satisfaction the expression of your desire to maintain with it the relations of amity and concord—a desire in which it cordially participates and has uniformly manifested. It is there fore proper that I should assure you that the late expedition to the Persian Gulf •did not originate in hostility towards you, but was, as above noticed, directed solely to the destruction of the pirates who had, in direct breach of their own positive engagements and with an entire forgetfulness of the former instances of condescending lenity manifested towards them, long infested the seas in that quarter, plundering vessels and murdering subjects of all nations indiscriminately, for the British Government does not concern itself with the hostilities carried on by you against the members of the Mussulman faith, on account of their alleged deviation Irom the ordinances of the Koran, and its power will alone be directed against those who, exercising the detestable profession of piracy, are the common enemies of all nations, ' Ihe channel of communication between us being now open, 1 request you will continue to afford me the pleasure of hearing of your prosperity and success. British Tlef iisal to assist Muscat against Wahabis, 1810-1811. 27. In 1810, and again in 1811, on the Sultan of Muscat appealing for assistance Nejd Precis, ^gainst the \\ ahabis and representing that his recent co-operation with the British § overnment had involved him in perpetual and implacable war with them, in which 6 trusted that the British Government would not remain neutral, the Government llK *ia replied that the British Government had always considered itself to be at Peace with the Wahabis, their late co-operation with the Sultan not having been in prosecution of war against the Wahabis generally, but merely for the extirpation ofLor.

' Under the influence of that solicitude and a just sense of the benetits and blessings of a state of peace,, it was recommended to the Imam to grant the terms of pacification solicited^ by the Wahabis if consistent with the honour and security of the State of Muscat. Covvespondence with the Wahahis, 1813. 28 In the course of 1813, on a Wahabi envoy to Muscat announcing his arrival Neid Precis at that place to the Government of Bombay with the object of restoring 'the Nejd . reels, * o{ ^ betvveen the two powers,' the Governor of Bombay wrote in reply * ' Entertaining, as I have always done, the most friendly disposition towards vour master I conceived it my duty even previously to the receipt of your letter to instruct Mr Bruce the British Resident at Bushire, to communicate with His Hio-hness Sand bin Abdul Aziz, and to establish such an amicable intercourse with him as cannot fail to be equally advantageous to both conn tries as well as for the o-eneral benefit of their respective neighbours, and it is with feelings ol particular satisfaction I observe Your Excellency has stated that a corresponding desire is sincerely entertained by His Highness Saud bin Abdul Aziz, and I shall therefore look forward with confidence to the speedy attainment of our reciprocal wishes. Wahahi Overtures, 1813-1814. 2° The Wahabi Amir had in 1810, in reply to British representations, intimated that he had interdicted his followers from molesting British vessels. Late in 1813, threatened by the advance of the Egyptians, he made overtures to the 1 ohtica Resident indicating his desire to form a connection with the British Government of mutual amity and friendship which might be beneficial to both states ana, acknowledging the superiority of rhe British over every other nation at sea proposed that the ports of each State should be open to each other and a Iree and unmolested trade carried on by their subjects. 30 The Government of India, however, while considering it politic ' to maintain a friendly intercourse with the Wahabi Chief and to endeavour by cordial and 18 2 1814 conciliatory conduct to confirm the amicable disposition which he appeared to lor I 1077. entertain towards the British Government,' thought it undesirable at this moment to enter into any regular engagement with him, even of a commercial charactei. British Proposal for Anglo-Eyptian Co-operation against Jowasimis rejected hy Egyptians, 1819. 31. In 1819,on hearing of the successes of the Viceroy of Egypt against the Sadleir, Wahabis and of the arrival of the Egyptian expedition on the Arab littoral of the Diai T Gulf, the Government of India endeavoured to arrange with Ibrahim Pasha for (1866). i^ j 0 i n t operations against the Jowasimis, with w^hich Muscat should be associated, on 4 1091-8 the understanding that in return Ras al Khaima would be made ovei to tie Egyptians. The British officer (Captain Sadleir) deputed for this purpose arrived only after the subjugation of the Wahabis and the withdrawal of the Egyptians. Mehemet Ali ultimately, however, replied that neither he nor the Porte desired or needed foreign help in dealing with the Wahabis of Nejd. 32. The Chief Secretary, Bombay, writing in 1820, recorded that a lettei had 'lately been received from Hussein bin Rahmah [formerly w ahabi vicegerent id Trucial Oman and Chief of Ras al Khaimah] referring to a treaty of peace concluded between 'his Imaum' and us, and professing a desire of continuing on terms o friendship with the English Government, which has of course been positney declined.' Bo. Sel. XXIV, 312. General Summary , 1808-1818. 33. The Wahabis in the early part of this period consolidated their position the Hejaz, Hasa, Nejd and Trucial Oman. In the latter area their control o 1 Sheikhs, exercised from the oasis of Baraimi, appears to have varied with ^ effective force at their disposal; but to have been particularly close in the ca \nof the Jowasimis, and less so in that of Abu Dhabi. Up to 1814 they bore heavily 011 the Sultan of Muscat, who, however, retained his independence, although he mid through much of the period a tribute to the VVahabi Amir. Relations with the British Government, as represented by the Government of India and the Government of Bombay, were polite and even friendly ; but the Indian authorities, while avoiding any cause of quarrel with the Wahabis and closing their eyes to the responsibility of the Wahabis for the piracies of the Jowasimis, declined also to involve themselves in any engagements with the Amirs. Between 1814 and 1818 the power of the Wahabis, who lost the Hejaz between 1810 and 1815, was completely destroyed by the Egyptian forces of Mehemet Ali, and, save to the extent that it survived as a purely religious movement, Wahabism temporarily entirely disappeared. 1818-1824.

In 1819-20 the Government of India effectively subdued the pirates of the Trucial Coast, destroyed their forts, and burnt their warships. The Sheikhs in Aitch. XII, May 1820 entered into a general treaty with H.M. Government to preserve the No. xix, maritime peace, H .M. Government on their side undertaking certain reciprocal PP- obligations of protection by sea. The treaties were concluded with the Trucial Sheikhs as independent rulers. In November 1820 H.M. Government took steps to subdue the Beni bu Ali of Jaalan in Muscat, who had been converted to Wahabism by the Wahabi expedition of 1813. Situation in Trucial Oman in 1822-1823. 35. In 1822, Abu Dhabi, now in control also of Debai, is stated to have been the firm ally of Muscat. The Jowasimi Sheikhdom of Shargah was peopled by strict Mohammedans, partly Sunni, partly Wahabi ; Umm al Qaiwain was strictly^Wahabi, Sel as was for the most part the Sheikhdom of Ajman. In 182o the Jowasimi Sheikhs xxi\, 315, (as distinct from the Beni Yas of Abu Dhabi and Debai) all appear to have ^&gt;41-3. acknowledged the general authority of Shargah.

In 1824 Sheikh Turki bin Abdulla, a descendant of the first Wahabi Amir, collected a force and marched against the Egyptians. At first defeated, he was subsequently successful. Between 1824 and 1830 he endeavoured to re-establish l or i ' iojh the A\ ahabi power. In 1830 he completely defeated the Beni Khalid and reconqueied ; in the following year Bahrein and Muscat both temporarily became tributary to him ; and by 1833 he had fully re-established Wahabi influence on the I rucial '-oast and in its hinterland and had reoccupied Baraimi. In the same year, however, Bahrein repudiated the agreement of 1831 and maintained itself against the Amh, whose coast it blockaded, until 1836, when peace was made. It is recorded in 1830 ^ that, while pretending to be free and independent, 'Turki had agreed, and XXIV, 439. continued, to pay a small annual tribute to Mehemet Ali Pasha, who approved of 8 P r oceedings which he took care to represent in a favourable light. 3076 C8 38. In 1834 Turki was murdered. He was succeeded by his son, Feisal bin Turki. In 1837 Mehemet Ali sent an expedition into Nejd to reduce the Wahabi Amir and replace him by the pretender Khalid. After two years of fighting, the Egyptians accomplished their object in 1839. The Wahabi Amir surrendered in Lor. I 1097 1838, and was sent a prisoner to Egypt. In 1840 the Egyptians again withdrew from Hasa, leaving the puppet Amir Khalid as its tributary Governor. 39. The principal events in the relations between the Wahabi Amirs and H.M. Government and the rulers of Eastern Arabia during this period are described below. Wahabi Relations with Muscat, 1824-1840. 40. Between 1824 and 1830 the Sultan of Muscat was principally busied with unsuccessful endeavours to reduce the Sheikhs of Bahrein. In 1.^29 he suffered a severe defeat at the hands of the Bahreinis and made peace with them. In 1831, in the hope of forwarding his designs in Bahrein, he sent an embassy with presents to the Wahabi Amir. 41. In 1833 the Sultan, with the encouragement of the Government of India, made a general agreement with the Wahabis, by which he undertook to pay a zakat of 5,000 dollars a year. A condition of the agreement was that each should hold possession of his coast according to the limits then existing ; the Muscat coast extending to Jaalan, and the coast of the Amir to Qatif. Reciprocal assistance was also promised in putting down rebellion. There is nothing to show for how long the tribute continued to be paid. 42. No other events of importance affecting Muscat took place until 1839. In face of the Egyptian invasion and the threat which is constituted to Eastern Arabia, the Sultan oAluscat, with a view to promoting his designs in Bahrein, which he had never abandoned, was then at first disposed to co-operate with the Egyptians, but on becoming aware of the hostility to Egyptian advance of the British Government, he associated himself with the views of the latter and refused a demand for assistance made upon him by the Egyptian Commander in Nejd.

Immediately on the revival of the Wahabi power in 1824, the Wahabi Amir opened correspondence with all the Sheikhs of the coast, inviting them to renew th e relations which had existed prior to the overthrow of the Wahabis by Ibrahim Pasha. The Jowasimi Sheikh of Shargah appears forthwith to have opened n 0 Sol negotiations with the Wahabis. ' This measure he did not attempt to conceal, but XXIV,316- assigned self -preservation as his only motive for adopting it.' Matters do not, 9, 437. however, appear to have proceeded far, and in November 1825 the Sheikh enquired Lor. I, 687. 0 f the Political Resident whether Great Britain would help him to maintain his Neid Pivcis independence against the Wahabis. He was informed in reply (see paragraph 52 § 35. below) that he was the best judge of his own interests, but that no connection or authority would be accepted in excuse of predatory proceedings, while action against Muscat would be considered unfriendly by H.M. Government Disputes heticeen Muscat, Ahu Dhahi, and Shargah over Baraimi, 1824-1826. 44. It may be recorded that in 1824-25 considerable difficulties arose locally between the Sultan of Muscat, the Sheikh of Shargah aud the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, over the occupation of the towers of Baraimi, which had apparently been re-occupied by the Trucial Sheikhs on or shortly after the downfall of the Wahabis in 1818.° Bv a solemn treaty the towers in question had previously been declared Bo. Sel. neutral, and on their occupation by Shargah the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, whether in XXIV, 317- concert with or independently of the Sultan of Muscat is not clear, had taken up the 319 ; 465. m atter. In December 1S24 a reconciliation was negotiated by the Resident, under whicb the Sheikh of Shargali was to destroy the towers, the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi • It should, however, be noted that Lorimer (I, 450) records a successful raid at some tin^ ayparentlj, between 1821 and 1828 . . . by Saad bin Mutlaq, Wahabi, from Baraimi on the Hajriys 1 tribe ' to avenge their slaying of his father Syed bin Mutlaq (paragraph 19 above).9 on his side destroying a fort which had been built at Derah. In February 1825 the Resident addressed a strong remonstrance to the Sheikh of Shargah for his delays in destroying the towers and received an evasive answer. In May l(S25 the Hosident sent his Native Agent, armed with authority from the Sheikh to effect the immediate destruction of the towers, to accompany a Muscat force. Hostilities, however, broke out between Shargah and Muscat, and the towers remained. In October 1825 a reconciliation was finally mediated between the two States by the Resident, in which no word was said about Baraimi, which appears to have remained in the possession of one or other of the Trucial Chiefs until about 1833. Wahabi reascendency established. 45. In May 1830, consequent on the defeat of the Beni Khalid of Hasa, the Wahabi Amir and his policy became a matter of acute importance in Trucial Oman. The bulk of the Jowasimis, and especially the Sheikhs of Ajman and Umm al Bo. Sel., Qaiwain, appear to have welcomed the prospect of Wahabi reascendency, 'the lower orders anticipating a return to their former piratical habits and the above Lor. I 687- two chiefs expecting to emancipate themselves from their dependence upon ' the 8, 1095. Sheikh of Shargah. The Sheikh of Shargah. who had in 1821 abjured Wahabi tenets, now, while outwardly professing sympathy with the Wahabis, wrote to the Resident in July 1830, 'expressing his earnest desire to co-operate with the British Government in checking their further progress, and went so far as to declare that he was determined to oppose them even in the event of his not receiving any support.' In reply he was informed that the British Government were solely interested in the suppression of piracy and could not interfere in the internal affairs of the Arab States. But the Wahabi Amir soon made it clear that he was not prepared to encourage any revival of piracy, and that he proposed to look upon the Sheikh ot' Shargah and the Sultan of Muscat as the heads of all the Arabian ^ ^ j ( . ss tribes in Oman. The Sheikh of Ajman, who had asked for a body of troops to enable him to throw off his dependence on Shargah, or even to attain the ascendancy in Shargah territories, and who had also suggested that he should cruise against the enemies of the Wahabis in the Gulf, met with a refusal on the ground inter alia that the English being the masters of the sea, the Wahabi Amir was not able to contend with so powerful a nation. In 1831 the Sheikh of Ajman was, however, used by the Amir as his intermediary with the Governor of Bombay (paragraph 53 below). Wahahi Claim to Suzerainty over Trucial Oman, 1833. 40. By 1833 the Wahabi ruler had established his influence throughout the Trucial Coast, and in that year a direct demand by the Resident on the Sheikh of ^hargah for redress for a piracy led to an intemperate letter from the Wahabi Lieutenant at Baraimi to the Residency Agent at Shargah. As the Wahabi representative had written without authority, no direct notice was taken of his communication, but the Residency Agent was instructed to point out the long delays and great forbearance shown before coercive measures had been resorted to by H.M. Government, ' and further to use other arguments importing the evident Bo. Sel. existence of our right to demand redress.' The Wahabi representative replied XXIV, 442. that Amir Turki ' was now the only authority on the continent of Arabia, and that both citizens and Bedouins, maritime as well as inland tribes, having all acknowledged his supremacy, he was in fact the ruler of the country, including Hajar, Oman, and the coast from Jaalan to Qalif, and that, therefore, on the occurrence of any piracy it should be reported to the Wahabi Chief, or, in the «vent of his being at too great a distance, to his Agent at Baraimi.' Aim Dhabi submits to the Wahabis, 1833. 47. Later in the same year the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi was murdered by his brother, w T ho, anxious to consolidate his position, tendered his allegiance and an annnal payment of tribute to the Wahabi Amir. The Amir in return informed nbargah that Abu Dhabi was under his protection and that he would permit of no Bo - Sel - Aggression upon them. Despite this, and the very categorical assertion of suzerainty ^ IV ' 161, referred to in paragraph 46 above, the threats of the Wahabi representative at baraimi proved insufficient to overawe Shargah, and in 1834 peace was concluded between Shargah and Abu Dhabi, one condition of which was that Debai should Lor.

Government and the Wahabis, 1824-1839. 52. In 1825 on the revival of the Wahabi power in Nejd, the Jowasimi Sheikb of Shargah enquired whether he might look to the British ^Tt ^habi assistance should he endeavour to maintain his mdependence agan ^ intrigue. He was informed in reply that he was the best judge of h ' but that no connection or authority would be received by the But as an excuse for any proceedings bearing a predatory charactei. n .f Muscat warned against co-operating with the Wahabis against t ie e \ 11 , r r-n m w]iB Nejd Precis, 'The language held on this occasion was confirmed !y the u)\onioi L ^ ^ § 34.

About the middle of 1831 the Wahabi Amir, through the intermediacy of Precis, § 37. the Sheikh of Ajmao, wrote to the Governor of Bombay expressing his desire to be upon the same intimate footing as that formerly existing between the British Government and his ancestor, Saud, and 'to have the treaty renewed which was made between you the British and Imam Saud.' 54. Search among the records of the Government of Bombay with reference to the alleged treaty showed that two documents only could be found bearing on British intercourse with the Wahabis, viz. those quoted in paragraphs 26 and 2S&gt; above. The Government of Bombay, in reply to the Amir, wrote as follows :— 'Your communication dated 25th Jumadyooluwul, informing me that by the appointment of the Ruler of Events you had arrived at the dignity of Chief of the W ahabi sect, has reached my hands, and given me the gratification which friends feel when they receive intelligence from friends. 'Your disposition to a friendly understanding is met with reciprocal feeling, and the terms of amity which existed between this Government and your great ancestor, Imam baud, will still remain in force, and, I cherish hopes, will never be broken or infringed. 1 send this letter by the hands of your faithful dependent Esa bin Hassan to express the same.' Mr. Lorimer remarks that the relative ignorance existing in Bombay at this Lor. 1,1096. time ol the position in Central Arabia is evidenced by the use of the phrase 'ancestor ' of the Imam Saud, who belonged to the same generation as the then Amir, and had died only in 1814. British Attitude, 1833-1840. 55. The question of the attitude to be adopted in the event of the Wahabi Amir J absorbing Muscat was considered by the Government of India and the Government G of , t() of Bombay in 1833-34. The Government of India intimated that they were not Bo. '1.2.34. prepared to send an expedition to maintain the continental possessions of Muscat and instructed the British authorities in the Gulf ' to observe a strict neutrality in any disputes that may arise between him [the Sultan of Muscat] and any of his neighbours on the continent of Arabia.' 1837-1839. 56. On the second Egyptian invasion of Nejd in 1837 to 1839, the Government of India (see paragraphs 59-62 below), moved by considerations of European Nejd Px^ecis, policy, spared no efforts to counteract the progress of the Egyptians and to persuade § 45. the Trucial Chiefs and the Beni Nairn of Baraimi to co-operate against them. 1839-1840. The Egyptians and Eastern Arabia. P F all of the Wahabi Amir. 57. The Amir Feisul surrendered and was sent to Egypt as a prisoner in December 1838, and by the beginning of 1839 the Egyptians were in complete control of Nejd and Ilasa. Hitherto they had supported a puppet Amir of the »ahabi family, the Amir Khalid. They now threw off the pretence of supporting Mialid, and declared that Nejd was a possession of Mehemet Ali, and that he would imp rove and extend his conquests. Khalid thereupon called upon the Sheikhs of ahrein for payment of tribute, and advances were made by the Egyptians towards Eastern Arabia. Egyptian Overtures to Muscat and Trucial Oman, 1839. 58. For this purpose they employed Sa'ad bin Mutlak, who, during the lifetime Bo g el ^ e Amir Turki, had been the Wahabi Lieutenant at Baraimi, but who had XXIV, 156, een removed by his son, Feisul, and who possessed great personal influence among 209, 336, I ' it ^ • ra ' as we ll as a perfect knowledge of their various and conflicting th eie ^ 3 r ^ a ' a d was despatched by the Egyptians to Ras-al-Khaimah to persuade j' le c iefs of the Oman coast to acknowledge the authority of the puppet Amir 1100-3.12 Khalid. A letter addressed by him to the Sultan of Muscat, directing Muscat to assist or be considered an enemy, was returned, but the Jowasimi Chief of Shargah at his instigation, summoned the Beni Nairn, ' who had lately got possession of Baraimi,' to surrender it to the Nejdis. The Beni Nairn refused and appealed to Abu Dhabi and the Chief of Sohar in Muscat for aid against the common enemy. Representations were also made to the Political Resident. British Countermeasures and Support fur Beni Nairn of Baraimi. 59. H.M. Government were at this time principally concerned to reduce Meheraet Ali to his proper position as a Turkish vassal and to prevent any further Egyptian advance in Eastern Arabia. The application of the Beni Nairn chiefs was therefore well received ; the Resident held out hopes that a British agent would be sent to Baraimi (Captain Hamerton subsequently visited the oasis in January -February of 1840) ; and he undertook, if necessary, to supply ammunition to the Chiefs. The I ^ l 457 Sultan of Muscat, who had at first shown a disposition to take the side of the J Egyptians, in the hope of re-establishing his ascendancy over Bahrein, was informed of the attitude of H.M. Government, and was called upon to support the Beni Nairn chiefs, a request to which he acceded. The Resident, after a formal protest against the proceedings and intrigues of the Egyptian Commander as being in direct opposition to the assurances which had been given by Mehemet Ali to H.M. Govern ment, obtained a written agreement from the maritime chiefs of Oman to cultivate close relations with the British Government, to abide by its wishes and instructions, and to resist to the last extremity ali attempts by the Egyptian Commander to subdue them. Withdrawal of Egyptian Agent under British pressure. 60. The Sheikh of Shargah, at his own request, was furnished with a document requiring him to demand the immediate departure of the Egyptian Agent. This was communicated to the Agent, who was also informed that, the British Govern ment having taken the chiefs and tribes of Nairn in Baraimi under their protection, be would be held responsible for any injury to them ; and he was required, in accordance with the assurances given by Mehemet Ali, to withdraw from Trucial Oman. After repeated remonstrances he quitted the Trucial Coast and, embarking at Shargah (where he is alleged to have been assured by the Sheikh that if he returned to Oman in force Shargah would join him and place all its resources at his disposal), proceeded to Ojair. The withdrawal of Sa'ad Bin iMutlak was a severe blow to Egyptian influence and is stated to have broken up the combination rapidly forming in favour of Mehemet Ali. The Government of India approved the action taken by the Resident, but intimated to him that they would not be prepared to extend protection to Baraimi. Egyptian Evacuation of Nejd, 1840. 61. After the departure of the Wahabi Agent an attack was made on the Beni Naim at Baraimi by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who was called to account by the Resident and required to make reparation to the Beni Naim. In the same year (1839) the Sheikh of Qatif was warned that any expedition against Oman or the territories of the Sultan of Muscat would be opposed by the British naval squadron in the Gulf. In 1840, internal dissensions breaking out among the Egyptians, Sa'ad bin Mutlak was arrested and sent under escort to Riyadh, while in May of that year the Egyptians evacuated Nejd, leaving the puppet Amir Khalid in charge as an Egyptian tributary. Attitude of H.M. Government, 1839-1841. 62. During the period 1839-41 H.M. Government departed from their policy of refusing to concern themselves in the internal affairs of the Trucial Sheikhdoms and of their hinterland. This modification of their attitude was directed by considerations of European rather than of Arabian policy. As will be seen below, once the Egyptian menace had been disposed of they reverted to their policy of non intervention, and the Sheikhs of Baraimi, who, not unnaturally, had been encouragd by the attitude adopted by H.M. Government in 1839-40 and by the visit of a British Agent to Baraimi in the latter year to hope for some substantial support14 P.R. to Bo. 21.1.65, Nejd Precis, §§ 77-117. Lor. I, 473- 4.

Resident, but ColoDel Pelly reached the conclusion that it was open to question whether the Wahabi Lieutenant at Baraimi, in the support he had given to the Chief of Rostack, was acting under instructions from the Wahabi Amir. It transpired that the differences which had arisen had a two-fold aspect: the first the rebellion of the Chief of Rostack ; the second and more important, a demand on the part of the Wahabi Amir for an increased annual tribute from the Sultan, coupled with a threat of invasion in the event of non-compliance. 67. In August 1865 the Beni bu Ali and the Jenabah tribes of south-east Muscat, both of them Wahabi by religion, captured Sur, inflicting considerable damage on British Indian subjects. A protest was at once made to the Wahabi Amir and to his deputy at Baraimi on behalf of the British Government and the Resident was authorised to take, in consultation with the Senior Naval Officer, such measuies as they might think likely to promote an arrangement between the Wahabi Amir and the Sultan. ' lie is not, however, to undertake anything on land.' Undertakings secured from Wahabis, 1c566. 68. The Amir defended the action of his Lieutenant on the ground of an agreement alleged to exist between the Wahabi State and the British Government, a statement for which there proved to be no foundation. The discussions which subsequently took place were unfruitful It proved necessary to bombard and destroy the forts of Sur, and to destroy a Wahabi tower at Ajman and certain Wahabi warships which were lying at Qatif; and the Wahabi Amir, faced with these evidences of a positive British intention to support the Sultan of Muscat and to secure reparation for the injuries which had been inflicted, sent an envoy to Bushire early in 1866, who requested the Resident, on behalf of the Amir, to mediate between the Amir and the British Government, and gave undertakings that no attack would be made upon British subjects residing in territories under the authority of the Amir or upon the territories ' of the Arab tribes in alliance with the British Government, especially of the Kingdom of Muscat, further than in receiving the zakat that has been customary of old.' The overtures made by the Amir were accepted by the Government of India and friendly relations were restored. The Wahabis in Trucial Oman, 1840-1870. The Amir Khalid and the Trucial Sheikhs, 1841. 69. In October 1841, on the Amir Khalid threatening to send a force into Oman, a British officer was deputed to inform him, both orally and in writing, that H.M. Government would disapprove of such a measure. The Amir disavowed any intention of adopting it and would apparently in any event have lacked the force to give effect to it. This was perhaps as well, &lt;l as the maritime Arab chiefs, though outwardly professing their determination to maintain their independence, were known to be secretly carrying on intrigues and correspondence with him.' Overtures of the Amir Ahdulla to the Trucial Sheikhs, 1842. 70. In February 1842 the Amir Abdulla addressed letters to the Sheikhs of Oman intimating his intention of sending Sa'ad bin Mutlak as his deputy to them and requesting them to afford him every aid and assistance. The originals of these letters (save in the case of Abu Dhabi, where the Sheikh refused to surrender the letter addressed to him) were obtained by the Political Resident, Colonel Robertson, who thereupon formally protested to the Wahabi Amir against his attempt to bring the Trucial Sheikhdoms under Wahabi influence, on the ground of the ill-effects which had hitherto resulted 'from the establishment of Wahabi interests among the pirate chieftains, which had led to their chastisement by the British Government.' The Amir, in reply, declared his intention of co-operating with the British Government to stamp out piracy and added that he had promulgated this to the people of Oman, whom he referred to as his subjects. The correspondence dropped with the overthrow of the Amir Abdulla in May-June of 1842, but it may be noted that in their published reply to the letters received from the Amir, the Sheikhs of Baraimi claimed a species of connection with the British Government (no doubt based on the encouragement given them in 1839—paragraph 59 above), although there was reason to believe that secret letters of a different tenour had also been despatched to the Amir by the Wahabi partisans among them.ft 15 Overtures of the Amir Feisul to the Truclal Sheikhs, 1843. 71. In 1843 the Resident concluded a Maritime Truce for a period of 10 years Aitch. Xll, with the Trucial Sheikhs. Followiug the example of his predecessor, the new Amir, Feisul, in July 1843 wrote to the maritime and inland Sheikhs of Oman, 1)p ' 0 intimating his intention shortly to send an army under Sa'ad Bin Mutlak to bring tlie Province under his authority.

Arrival in Oman of Sa'ad bin Mutlak (1845) and reoccupation of Baraimi 72. No marked advance appears to have been made by the Wahabis until 1845, when Sa'ad bin Mutlak arrived in the vicinity of Baraimi. The Beni Naim, in the absence of any support or reassurance from Great Britain, at once submitted, while the [{esident, in reply to enquiries by the Regent, in the absence (in Zanzibar) of the Sultan of Muscat, as to the course to be adopted in face of the Wahabi Bo. Sel. requests for submission, advised that, provided the terms proposed by the Wahabis were not extravagant, they should be accepted. If they proved excessive, the Regent should reply that he could not accede to them without first consulting the British Government, whose ally he was. Opposition to Wahahis. 73. Sa'ad bin Mutlak's course proved less smooth than may have been expected. On his arrival Wahabi influence was so great in Trucial Oman as to endanger the security of Muscat. But it was soon severely shaken by a refusal on the part of the Beni Said tribe to pay tribute, and by the punishment administered by them to the envoy of the Wahabi Lieutenant, who was unable to persuade the maritime Sheikhs to assist him against them. Protests against Wahabi aggressions on Muscat were also received from the Resident. By the end of the year a reaction against the Wahabis had taken place in Trucial Oman. Umm al Qaiwain alone of the Trucial Sheikhs now supported the Wahabi Lieutenant, who was isolated at Bo. Sel. Baraimi. Of the other tribes the Beni Said were joined in opposition to him by the XXIV, 218- Al Said and the Abu Rashid, while the Muttawas, the Beni Naim and the Chief of Sohar formed a separate alliance with the same object. ' The effect of these two separate confederacies, both composed of powerful and numerous followers,' must 'have been highly beneficial and tended greatly to prevent the inordinate aggrandise ment of the Wahabi power in the Province of Oman.' 74. The next few years show in a conspicuous degree the volatile and uncertain nature of the relations of the Trucial Sheikhs (w T ho in 1847 entered into an anti- slavery treaty with H.M. Government) both with one another and with the Wahabis. In 1845 Abu Dhabi united with his hereditary enemy Shargah to crush Ajaman, Debai and Umm al Qaiwain. In 1847 Debai joined Shargah. In January 1818 Shargah found himself isolated and opposed by a combination of the remaining Trucial Sheikhs. Later in 1848 hostilities broke out between Abu Dhabi and the Wahabi Lieutenant in Oman. Capture of Baraimi hy Ahu Dhabi (1848) and its Restoration to Wahabis (1849). 75. On 16th June the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi captured Baraimi, the garrison surrendering; defeated a Nejdi expedition sent to restore the position, and Lor -1- 7C,7 • compelled the Wahabi Agent to take refuge with the Sheikh of Shargah. But the successes of Abu Dhabi aroused the apprehensions of the other Trucial Sheikhs, who now combined against him, and the Sheikh, support from Muscat seeming improbable, in February 1849 made peace with the Wahabis and agreed to restore the Baraimi forts to the Wahabi Agent.

In November 1850, however, Shargah,.Abu Dhabi, and the Beni Nairn of Baraimi were again allied against the Wahabis. In 185], Abu Dhabi and Shargah having reached an understanding (one result of which was to make Debai draw closer to the Wahabis), Abu Dhabi assisted Bahrein against the Wahabi Amir. Expedition of Abdulla bin Feisal to Oman, 1852. 77. Towards the end of 1852 the Wahabi Amir despatched his son, Abdulla, to Trucial Oman. Abdulla is stated to have come 41 in the character of arbiter and redresser of wrongs suffered by his people (the Sheikhs) in Oman at the hands of Muscat.' He established himself at Baraimi, supported by an imposing force, and called upon all the maritime and inland Sheikhs to attend him. All the maritime Sheikhs responded to this summons with the exception of Debai, who sent his uncle to represent him, but explained to the Resident that he was opposed to the presence of Wahabis in Oman. Shargah, anxious to injure Muscat, lent his fullest support to the Wahabis and urged an attack on the Batineh, Abu Dhabi thereupon adopted an opposite course, intimated that he would not be prepared to co-operate personally in such a policy, and disbanded most of his forces. The Resident and the Wahabis, 1852—1853. 78. Meanwhile, the Resident was anxious to renew the maritime truce concluded for 10 years in 1843 and'' called upon the Trucial Sheikhs to attend him for this purpose. The Trucial Sheikhs other than Debai were all at Baraimi, and Ummal Qaiwain, in particular, ' in seeking permission to return to his port for the purpose of meeting the Resident, had some degree of restraint imposed on his actions.' Shargah also alleged that he was detained at Baraimi. He was instructed in reply to proceed forthwith to the coast. The Resident informed the Wahabi Commander of his extreme surprise that any circumstances whatever should induce him to prevent the Sheikhs from obeying his call, and a warship was sent to patrol the Trucia! Coast. These measures proved effective, the Sheikhs repaired to the Resident, and on the 4th May 1853 signed as independent rulers the Perpetual Maritime Truce at Shargah. Trucial Oman in 1854. 79. A report from the Resident in 1854 remarks that the Trucial Sheikhs ' are independent, but acknowledge the feudal supremacy of the Wahabi ruler whenever his own power, or their dissensions, may place him in a position to exercise it. Their chiefs are expected to afford military aid in his expeditions and to furnish supplies to his troops when present, as in the case of the garrison at Baraimi in Oman. The territorial possessions of the maritime chiefs are confined to the inhabited spots on the sea coast and may be said to be bounded by the walls of their towns and the date gardens in their immediate vicinity. . . . The maritime tribes are closely related to the nomad tribes in the interior, over whom the chiefs of the former exercise a limited control.' Shargah, Debai and Umm al Qaiwain are described at this time as belonging to the Wahabi sect. Lor. I, 726. P.K. to Bo. 5A, 22.9.54. 2a, 6.6.55. Lor. I, 727. Decline in Wahabi Influence in Oman, 1854. 80. But despite the imposing character of the Wahabi mission to Oman in 18o3, the power of the Wahabi Agent at Baraimi had by 1854 fallen to a low point. ' Having no longer any material force at his command he was reduced to maintaining his position by petty intrigue and playing off one Sheikh against another.' I 11 1854 he was reported to be exercising a restraining influence on the Wahabi Amirs. But in the following year he was involved in intrigues against Shargah, and in that year the Naim of Baraimi suggested to the Resident that British influence should be used for the expulsion of the Wahabis. The Resident, however, explain^ that the policy of Government was now one of non-intervention in internal affairs, and himself merely continued to avoid, as his predecessors had done since 1840, direct communication with or recognition of the Wahabi representative.' 81. In 1855-56 the Chief of Abu Dhabi was expelled from his State, a 111 ^ appealed to the Amir to instruct his Agent in Oman to assist him. With the assistance of the Agent the ex-Sheikh re-established himself in Abu Dhabi.Wahabi Injiuence m Trucial Oman in 18(35. 82.

It will be observed that Abu Dhabi and Debai are classed as supporters of Muscat, and that Qatar and a fairly deep fringe along the Trucial sea coast are shown as failing outside the Wahabi sphere. Fall of Baraimi and Destruction of Wahahi Power in Trucial Oman, 1869. S3. Little of moment appears to have occurred in the Prucial area between 1856 and 1870. In 1864-66 the Trucial Sheikhs appear to have stood aside from the struggles between Muscat and the Wahabis. In 1866 the Wahabis undertook not ' to injure or attack the territories of the Arab tribes in alliance with the Lor. I, 727, British Government . . . further than in receiving the zaliat that has been customary of old.' In 1867 the ex-Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah unsuccessfully sought for Wahabi intervention. In April 1869 the Wahabi Lieutenant at Baraimi, having involved himself in the affairs of Shargah, was murdered there. In June 1869 the Sultan of Muscat captured Baraimi and formed an alliance with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, originally directed against the other Sheikhs of Oman, whom the Sultan suspected of favouring the Wahabis. But on the Sheikh of Shargah joining this alliance all danger from the Wahabis came to an end, and, with the reassertion of Turkish influence farther west in 1870-71 and the gradual collapse of the Saudi dynasty, Wahabi influence ceased to be of importance in •Trucial Oman, save in a purely religious sense, for half a century. Qatar and the Wahabis, 1840-1870. 84. Bahrein assumed a dominating influence in Qatar throughout most of this period. In 1851 there'was risk of the establishment of Wahabi influence in it, but a peace arranged in J uly of that year removed any risk of the dispossession of the Sheikhs of Bahrein by the Wahabis. Bahrein tributary to Wahabis in respect of Qatar, 1866. 85. In 1866 the Political Resident, after a careful investigation, expressed the view, which was accepted by the Government of India in 1867, that the Sheikh of Bahrein probably owed fealty to the Wahabi Government on account of his Lor. 1,892. possessions in Qatar and that the tribute of 4,000 dollars a year which he at that time paid to the Wahabi Amir ' was regarded as a payment made to secure his subjects in Qatar from aggression by other tribes of the mainland.' The Amir appears at one time (between 1852 and 1856) to have had a representative of his Lor. I, 800. own at Dohah. But Lorimer expresses the opinion that it is probable that this agent was only the local Sheikh. 86. By 1868 the El Thani family had obtained a dominant influence in Qatar. Lor. I, 802.

From 1843 to 1847 the Wahabi Amirs from time to time lent a considerable degree of support to the dispossessed Sheikh Abdulla of Bahrein, and in 1845 the ex-Sheikh unsuccessfully attempted to capture the islands with their assistance. Lor. I, 880. In 1846 the Wahabi Amir was refused permission by the Resident to call in the Trucial Sheikhs of the Arab littoral against Bahrein, a corresponding request by the Sheikh of Bahrein to be allowed to enlist the Sheikh of Debai against the Wahabis being equally refused in November of the same year. In August 1847 a treaty of peace was concluded between the Wahabi Amir and the ruling Sheikh, under 'which the ruling Sheikh agreed to pa} 7 a tribute of 4,000 dollars a year, while the Wahabi Amir agreed to abandon his support of the ex-Sheikh. 88. In 1850-51 the Amir was prevented from taking and possibly subduing Bahrein by the intervention of H.M. Government, and a peace by which Bahrein Lor. 1,1112 a greed to pay tribute was concluded between the Sheikh and the Wahabis in »)uly ' 0 f that year. In the following year, the Sheikh proposing to withhold his tribute18 from the Wahabi Amir, on the advice of the Resident decided to pay it. In 1853 the Government of Bombay were authorised to afford every obstacle to an attack on Bahrein by the Wahabis (who were now nominally subject to the Turkish Government). In 1859 a Wahabi attack was again averted by British intervention, but the Amir formally asserted his authority over Bahrein, declaring that he was himself a vassal of tbe Sultan of Turkey (see paragraphs 91 and 105 below); in 18(31 it proved necessary l-o bring pressure to bear on tbe Sheikh to discontinue a blockade of the Wahabi ports which he had instituted, and, later in the same year, to take forcible action for the removal of the Bahreini pretender from Qatar, despite the support accorded to him by the Wahabis.

In 1841 the Porte, having received presents from the puppet Amir Khalid, advanced claims to authority over ISiejd and appointed him Wali of Nejd on their behalf. In 1851 the Amir was undervstood to pay tribute to the Porte, despite the fact that ' accredited envoys of the Pasha of Kgypt were present in his camp and the Wahabi agent at Koweit professedly supported Egyptian interests. ' In 1855 (see paragraph 105 below) the Amir stated in terms, in writing, that he was a dependent of the Turkish Government and that the dependence of Nejd on Turkey had been made clear to Mehemet Ali in 1839. In 1859, again in writing, he referred to treaties between Nejd and the Porte (paragraph 106 below). In 1862 a Turkish protest against the bombardment of Damman in Qatar, on the ground that, as lying within the territories of 'Feisul Beg the Kaimakam of Nejd,' it was ''part of the hereditary dominions of the Sultan,' was rejected (paragraph 108 below). Wahabi Appeal to Turkey, 1866. 92. In 1866 the Amir sent an envoy to Bagdad complaining of English aggression , upon the coast of Nejd and its dependencies, and soliciting Turkish intervention ' against its recurrence, and the Turkish Wali raised the matter official^ with the British Consul-General, and ' loudly asserted the suzerainty of the Sultan over Nejd.' But in the following month the envoy was abruptly dismissed; and the Consul-General conjectured, in the light of further discussion with the Wali, that the explanation was that the Amir, ' when urged by the authorities of Bussorah to be more explicit in his communications, not only evaded compliance, but signified his repudiation of Turkish supremacy by despatching envoys to Bushire to treat with the Resident, while on the other hand the Ottoman Ministry at Constantinople . . . probably pointed out the inexpediency of extending to more remote tribes and principalities in Arabia that condition of quasi dependence which is found only too onerous and embarrassing in the case of the Bedouin tribes. . • • 98. Nothing further of importance emerges in regard to the relations between Turkey and the Wahabi Amirs between 1865 and 1870, but thereafter the Turks took immediate advantage of the dissensions which had broken out in the ruling family, conquered Hasa in 1871, and re-established themselves in that Province and in Nejd.19 1853 ttack rkish ition, s 'was ); in nue a year, ^atar. itions Jt no ed an rly as d the I 'ptian i rkish ' head halid, their :e the p and 1855 was a urkey ig, he i 1862 i that, ' part v )- ession ention the i over nd the i, that rah to unified ire to jry ^ more which 3t\vePD Turk 5 rulicg ce a iid The Wahabis and H.M.

In October 1841 the Government of Bombay deputed a British officer to visit Khalid at his camp in Hasa, consequent on rumours that he contemplated the invasion of Oman. He gave satisfactory guarantees that he had no such intention. 96. In 1842 overtures made to the Trucial Sheikhs by the Amir Abdulla, who Lor. 1,1108. had overthrown Khalid in February 1842, drew a formal protest from the Resident. Li 1843 the Amir Feisul, having overthrown the Amir Abdulla, intimated to the Trucial and inland Sheikhs of Oman that he proposed to bring that area under his ^ British Assistance refused to Beni Nairn of Baraimi, 1843. 97. The Chiefs of Baraimi thereupon in November 1843 applied for the aid of Bo. SeL, the British Government. They were informed in reply that 'the communications XX1\, 454, formerly entered into with them by the British Government had reference solely to the advance of the Egyptian troops and the connection subsisting between H .H. Muhammad Ali Pasha with Nejd, but that these circumstances being now altogether changed and the impending danger removed by the departure of the troops under Khurshid Pasha from that province, it was now the intention of the British Government to withdraw from all interference in the internal ailairs oi Arabia.' Overtures hy Amir Feisal, 1843. 98. At about the same time the Wahabi Amir on his side informed the Resident Bo. Sel., of his anxiety for the renewal of the amicable relations which had formerly existed XXU between his father, Turki, and the British Government. An appropriate response was made to this communication, and the Amir was also informed that the sole object of the British Government in this quarter was the suppression of plunder and bloodshed on the seas and the security of all well-disposed inhabitants on the shores of the Gnlf. Policy of Government of India and Government of Bombay, 1843-1845. 99. The Government of Bombay, having at about this time suggested doubts as Nejd Precis, to whether the Wahabi Amir should be allowed to obtain a preponderating influence § at Bahrein and over the Arab chiefs who were in treaty relations with H.M. Government, were informed by the Government of India that it was ' not at present necessary or expedient to interfere with the proceedings ol the Chief. 100. The Government of Bombay reverted to the subject on 26th August 1844, and pointed out that in the 'now certain event of the Amir Feisal, the legitimate Wahabi Ruler, extending his authority over the chiefs of Oman, and especially if he endeavoured to effect this object by sea,' British relations with Oman and the maritime Arab Chiefs might be affected and the resumption of piracy facilitated. They suggested the possibility of an arrangement with the Amir ratifying and securing existing engagements at sea; ' In other words, that as the price of forbearance on the part of the British Government this chief should become a party to its maritime engagements, whereby commercial interests may be secured.' The Government of India took no action on this suggestion. 101. Early in 1845, consequent on the re-establishment of the Wahabi Agent at Baraimi and his inroads into Muscat, the Bombay Government again consulted the Government of India as to the action to be taken if Muscat asked for British help against the Wahabis. The Government of India replied that if '' the mere G. of I. to e stablishment of the Wahabi power in Oman and the reception of the willing lio -' allegiance of the maritime chiefs, whom, on a former occasion, we took under our protection and encouraged to resistance, were to be the only result of the present ^pedition ... the Governor-General in Council would see no occasion to modify Nejd Precis, ■ i the opinion given in 3076 the letter from this office of 7th October 1843, that our § 56 - F l s ■ I o' 20 interference is not called for.' If, however, the Amir's purposes appeared to be to encroach on Muscat, or if ' the result of these proceedings is found detrimental to our relations with the maritime Arabs and our measures for the suppression of piracy,' a case for interference would arise, and in such an event it miglit be desirable that the Government of Bombay should warn the Amir that our forbearance would be extended no further. Such an expression of the views of the British Government would probably be sufficient to cause him to desist from active operation against Muscat. At any rate, a demonstration by sea by the British naval forces would produce the desired effect. If the Government of Bombay considered that the mere declaration of our views or naval operations alone would in all probability effect what is desired they were given discretion to proceed accordingly. Otherwise, they should refer for further instructions to the Government of India, A strong naval demonstration was subsequently made, and forcible remonstrances addressed by the Political Resident both to the Amir and to his Lieutenant at Baraimi resulted in the conclusion of an understanding between Muscat and the Amir. 102. In 1846 the Wahabi Amir was refused permission by the Government of India to borrow aid against Bahrein from Trucial Oman, a corresponding request Lor. I, 881. from Bahrein being likewise refused. Bahrein supported against Wahahis, 1851. Lor. 1, 1112. 103. In 1851 the Amir, consequent on British naval intervention, found himself obliged to come to terms with the Sheikh of Bahrein. Muscat supported in Negotiations with W ahahis, 1852. 104. In 1852 the Resident, on Abdulla, son of the Amir, entering Oman, remonstrated sharply with him for detaining at Baraimi the maritime Chiefs at a time when he (the Resident) desired their presence to discuss a renewal of the maritime truce, and negotiations between Muscat and the Wahabis were facilitated by a British naval demonstration along the Arabian coast. Nejd Precis, §61. me, harbouring of Correspondence with Amir, 1855. 105. In January 1855 the Resident pointed out to the Imam that the British Government regarded the Arab tribes on the coast as independent Powers. The Amir's reply is of some importance. He stated that ' being a dependant of the Exalted Turkish Government I hold the confirmation of the Sultan to my con tinuance in authority over all the Arabs. To exemplify this, when Mehemet Ali Pasha . . . deputed his envoy to me, professing to hold me dearer and more cherished than his own sons, to induce me to forward his interests in respect of the coast of Oman and elsewhere within the peninsula of Arabia and to offer no hindrance or opposition ... I replied ' Vou know that f am a dependant of the Sultan of the Faithful, from whom, if you possess orders to that effect, let me be informed of them. Otherwise this thing is impossible.' Thereupon war broke out between me and him which lasted two years, and intelligence thereof duly reached the Sublime Porte and they (the Sultan's Government) greatly rejoiced and were much pleased with me and my influence and consideration with them increased exceedingly. May God perpetuate their rule and the glory of their state.' ' With regard to what you observe, that engagements have existed between the chiefs of the coast of Oman and the Resident for a period of 30 years, this is well known to their object being to guard against the occurrence of irregularities and the disorderly characters, nought else. This is an arrangement of which I quite approve on the part of Residents—both those who have gone before and those who come after—for there is an understanding between us and the British Government of 100 years' duration for the security of traders and travellers passing on the seas. The coasts of Oman, however, and the territories thereof appertain to the peninsula of Arabia under my control, and acknowledging my authority. Further, the people of the districts in the interior of Oman and at the seats of the Bedouin tribes are more powerful than, and have the command over, the inhabitants of the coast and could not be restrained from preying upon and slaughtering them, but that I maintain a Lieutenant with a force in Oman, who holds them back fro® the people of the coast. These last are well assured of his protection ; otherwise, were they abandoned to their fate, they could not subsist. Moreover, when, owing to. their negligence, disagreements, too long to be detailed, and bloodshed han21 arisen between some of the CLiefs of the coasts aforesaid, there was none could check them and restore order and goodwill among them except the Lieutenant in Lor.

In 1859, the Wahabi Amir threatening to support the Bahreini pretender, Muhammad bin Abdulla, against the de facto chief, the Persian Gulf Squadron was despatched to Bahrein, with the result that the Wahabi Governor of Qatif abandoned his designs and begged for pardon. The Amir, however, after justifying his proceedings on the ground that the Sheikh of Bahrein was one of his feudatories Tj0r l gg 7 whom he had a perfect right to chastise for various misdeeds, strongly protested Nejd Precis against British interference and added that ' between the Wahabi Amir and the § 63. British Government treaties Have been made by the several authorities, authority after authority, and, in accordance with treaties between the Wahabi Amir and tlie Sultan Abdul Mejid, there are matters which everyone is precluded from meddling with, unless on special grounds.' The Resident replied that the British Government recognised Bahrein as an independent Sheikhdom and was prepared to oppose all foreign agency, including that of H.H. the Amir, by ever}^ means in its power. He added that the Amir's claim to be a dependant of Turkey was inconsistent with the piracies which were at the same time being committed by his Lieutenant at Qatif on vessels bearing the Turkish flag. Bombardment of Damman f 1861. 107. In June 1861 the Amir w^as required to eject the Bahreini pretender from Damman in Qatar, and was advised to enter into a peaceful convention with the ruling Sheikh. No answer having been returned, the Persian Gulf Squadron forcibly compelled the Pretender to flee from Damman in November 1861. The Wahabi garrisons took no steps to molest the Squadron. Turkish Protest and British Reply, 1862. 108. A Turkish protest against the bombardment of Damman—a place which, Ne j d p r 6cis, as lying within the territory of ' Feisul Beg, the Kaimakham of Nejd,' ' was part of § 67. the hereditary dominions of the Sultan '—was received from the Turkish Wali of Bagdad at the end of 1861. The British Consul-General at Bagdad replied that H.M. Government had hitherto ' always maintained direct relations with Amir Feisul as well as with all the chiefs and principalities situated on the shores of the Persian Gulf.' In the prosecution of our pacific policy in the Gulf, which was well known, we ' have never acknowledged the authority or jurisdiction of any other State—an authority and jurisdiction, moreover, which assuredly the Porte neither does exercise nor has ever exercised in that quarter.' The Consul-General, ia reporting the correspondence to the Ambassador at Constantinople, remarked : to ''Although it may not be denied that since the Egyptian invasion of Nejd in Const., 1839-40 Amir Feisul has remained tributary to the Turkish authorities of Mecca, 1.1.62. his tribute being regarded probably as an offering to the head of the religion, it is certain that the Porte has never exercised any jurisdiction or attempted to extend its authority over that country. ... In point of fact the Porte has not the power to punish or coerce its tributary; not a single Turkish functionary exists in the country, and to judge from my own experience of the duties of the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, I feel assured that, were the relations of that officer with the Amir of Nejd to be disturbed in a manner to withdraw the Wahabi coast from his immediate supervision, the effect must be highly prejudicial to the policy which has hitherto obtained under the orders and sanction of Her Majesty's Indian Government in that quarter.' Resident authorised to mediate between Muscat and the Wahabis, 1864. 109. Towards the end of 1864, serious difiiculties having arisen between the oultan of Muscat and the Wahabi Amir consequent on the endeavours of the Vahabi Agent at Baraimi to secure a substantial increase in the amount of zakat ^ p r6c - s paid by Muscat to the Wahabis, Colonel Pelly, then Political Resident, was § 72. ^quested to report fully and to employ his good offices if mediation were of any l ^ e '.

This visit is of some importance, as Ibn Saud lias tended to suggest (both recently, in 1911 (paragraph 148 below) and in 1913 (paragraph 152 below) that an agreement (in 1911 alleged to have been oral) was reached between Colonel Telly and his ancestor on this occasion. It may, therefore, be recorded that the Resident's visit, though subsequently formally approved by both the Government of Bombay and the Government of India, was undertaken on his own initiative and without any previous reference to or sanction of either Government • and that the Resident had no instructions on the basis of which he could have conducted negotiations. The Despatch reporting that lie was proceeding to Riyadh remarks : I hope that I shall leave the Wahabi Provinces on polite terms 'with the people, and with the prospect of more friendly relations with the Wahabi Government. It is possible, also, I may find an opportunity for a casual and friendly office towards smoothing the present differences between the Sultan of Muscat and the Wahabis.' No Agreement concluded with the Amir. 111. Colonel Pelly's report on his visit makes it clear that there was no discussion with the Amir regarding the conclusion of any treaty or understanding. Towards the end of the visit, however, the Amir's Secretary (elsewhere described as a ' frivolous and vindictive mongrel') intimated that he (the Secretary) 44 was very desirous that I should enter into some treaty whereby the Arabs of Oman, Soor and the Persian Gulf should be exempted from our slave piracy (sic); and receive from us the same consideration which we had accorded to the Sultan of Zanzibar in entering into a treaty with His Highness confirmatory of the slave trade. The Secretary added that he was empowered by the Amir to offer an exchange treaty binding him to prevent the Arabs of Oman and the Gulf from committing depredations or injuring our telegraph establishments. The manner of the Secretary became somewhat familiar and he stated that, as I was in their capital it would be a convenient time to have a draft of the agreement made. I rebuked his manner; absolutely refused his request; and gave him his cong&amp;' There is no further reference in the report to the conclusion of any agreement, and no reference was made to the point in the Resident's farewell interview with the Amir, at which, however, the latter ' expressed a wish that in regard to Qatif and Oqair I would refer to him if piracy or wrecking happened and that he would punish the aggressor to the utmost . . . begged me in like manner to protect hi&amp; maritime interest on the Persian coast . . . concluded by expressing a wish that I should write to him . . . and said that his curtness had been owing to his previous relations with the Residency, but that now he would turn over a new leaf and had given instructions accordingly to his Governors on the coasts.' There is nothing to suggest that the Resident concluded any agreement with the Amir, verbally or otherwise, that any understanding or agreement was reached during his visit, or that the visit aimed at, or achieved, any object other than the establishment of friendly personal relations, the dissipation of the view previously apparently held that it was difficult if not impossible for a European to penetrate to Riyadh, and some preliminary exploration of the ground in regard to the differences which had arisen between the Wahabi Amir and the Sultan of Muscat. Suggestions thai Great Britain might assist the Amir in fighting the Turks or other tribes were not encouraged by the Resident. 112. It may be added that among Sir Lewis Pelly's private papers in the India Office there exists a rough private journal of a fragmentary character, which contains inter alia some notes of his conversations with the Wahabi Amir. Here likewise there is no reference to or suggestion of any agreement, but the following notes are of interest: ' Assurance to my interpreter after my departure that he [the Amir] was very pleased with the visit, that for the future he would open a new- book ot relations with me, and keep all his proceedings (? unveiled) from and in direct communication with me ' . . . ' Imam's remark that if more cut off from the world than other States, he was still an independent sovereign and feared no one.'23 ; i Colonel Pelly on the Relation between the Wahahi Amirs and the Gulf Sheikhdoms. 113. In the general conversations that took place between Colonel Pelly and the i^ara. 74. Amir the latter claimed sovereignty over all Eastern Arabia, from Koweit to lias 1 Hadd ' This land of Arabia,' he remarked, ' from Koweit through Qatif, Kas ! Kb aim ah Oman, Ras al Hud and beyond, which God has given unto us.' He stated that in previous years the Turks had seized some of his territories, but that hp did not fear them. . i . -d n The Resident in the course of his report remarks that the quasi -independent I ara. 11. pWfrains' along the Arab littoral 4 ' were in fact more or less the puppets ot the great inland power of Nejd ' ; and elsewhere that the Wahabi Government 'dominates the western seaboard of the Persian Gulf and that of Oman. It a 1 &lt;l - • receives tribute, whether in kind or money, from the chieftains of Bahrein, Abu Dhabi Dibai, Umin al Qaiwain, Ajman, Shargah and Ras al Khaimah It holds an advanced militarv post at Baraimi, astride between these chieftains and the bultanate of Muscat, which is also its tributary. . .' He further observed that if the Amir Vbdullah, who succeeded Feisul in 1865, were enabled to consolidate his pov^c i at p ara ^^3 home and to be assured against our intervention abroad, the result would probably be that the Wahabi confederacy would directly dominate the chiefs of the 1 irate Coast; and that all Eastern Arabia, from Koweit to Ras al Hadd, would ultimately, whether willingly or unwillingly, fall under Wahabi influences.' 114 Later in 1865 the Resident, with the approval of the Government of India, offered to mediate between the Amir and Muscat, and British intervention proved Lor. 1, 464. necessary owing to the Wahabi activities at Sur referred to in paragraphs 07 and 68 above. Claim by Wahabi Amir that Proceedings of his Agent at Baraimi were justified by an Agreement with H.M. Government, 1865. 115 Meanwhile, the Amir, in reply to the remonstrances addressed to him in Nejd Precis, regard to the Sur'incident, endeavoured to justify his action and defended the §^ 2 ; proceedings of his Lieutenant at Baraimi on the ground that there existed between ^ ^ 12 65) the Wahabi Amirs and the British Government an agreement originally ettected No 197 in the time of the late Amir Sand, and again ratified in the time of the present g. of I. to , m t • Bo., 24.1.66, ruler, lurki. ^ t No. 66. 116. No trace of any such treaty as that mentioned by the Wahabi Amir could be found in the Residency at Bushire or in the records of the Government of India. The Government of India stated that it would be advisable ' for the Bombay Government to inform the Wahabi Amir that the British Government is not aware of the existence of any formal agreement between itself and the Amir, but that il any such document does exist, a copy of it, no doubt, must be in the Amii s possession, and the Amir will do well to produce it for verification. The Amn should likewise be given to understand that any encroachment on the territory o Muscat would be viewed with grave concern. British Punitive Action against Wahabis, 1866. 117. Considerable subsequent discussion and correspondence took place in regard to the affairs of Muscat during 1866, and on the 6th January in that year a formal warning was addressed to the Amir Abdulla, who had succeeded his father Peisul bin Turki on the latter's death at the end of 1865, with a request for full and written apologies for the Sur incident. During the month, ^ ahabi towers and ships ueie destroyed by the Persian Gulf Squadron, and in February the forts at Sin were equally destroyed by gunfire and a severe punishment inflicted on the local Wahabi tribes. Towards the end of the month letters dated 28th January were received from the Wahabi Amir, which were followed by the despatch of an envoy to Bushire with definite proposals of peace. Wahabi Undertaking of 21st April 1866. 118. The Resident arrived at Bushire on 2Jst April 1866 and interviewed the ^ ahabi representative, whose assurances and wishes appeared to be in all ivspects satisfactory. The envoy gave the following written declaration to Colonel Pelly:— ' I, Mohamed bin Abdulla bin Maneh, am certain on the following points: ' I am authorised by Imam Abdulla bin F eisul to request the Sahib, the Ucsident in the Persian Gulf, to become the medium of friendship between Imam Abdulla bin Feisul and the British Government ; 3076 G Aitch. XI1, No. i, p. 260. i illNejd Precis, § 116. Political A, June 1866, Nos. 64-5. 24 ' Secondly, I assure the Resident in the Persian Gnlf on the part of the Imam Abdulla bin Feisul that he will not oppose or injure British subjects residing in territories under the authority of Abdulla bin Feisul ; and 'Thirdly, I assure the Resident in the Persian Gulf, on the part of Imam Abdulla bin Feisul, that he will not injure or attack the territories of the Arab tribes in alliance with the British Government, especially of the Kingdom ol Muscat, further than in receiving the zakat that has been customary of old.' 119. It will be observed that this declaration was volunteered by the Wahabi representative and does not in itself constitute a treaty between the two parties. Its acceptance was approved by the Government of India, and the Resident thereupon wrote to the Wahabi Amir a letter from which the following is an extract : — ' I have received Your Highness' friendly letter by the hand of your confidential servant, Md. bin Abdulla bin Mana and suite. ' You state that you are desirous for peace, and your envoy has handed to me a paper, copy of which I enclose and which has been approved by H.M. Government. ' II difficulties should hereafter arise as to the payment to be made to you by Muscat, the English Government do not wish to interfere or become guarantee in a matter which concerns you and the Sultan. Rut the English Government would not object to my using my good offices in arranging the details of an agreement, and your Envoy informs me that in the contingency of such question arising, you will write and request my good offices. . . . I hope this may find you in health, and if you have any difficulty send to me a confidential Agent, and I shall always be happy to meet him on friendly terms as I have Md. bin Abdulla bin Mana.' 1 Basis of a Wahahi Claim that H.M. Government had entered into previous Agreements with Wahahi Amirs, 1866. 120. The Resident, in reporting the result of his final interview with the envoy, wrote : ' I asked the Wahabi envoys what the Amir meant by stating in his letters that agreements had existed of old between his Government and the British. The envoys replied that the Wahabi Amirs had, from time to time, received friendly letters from the British authorities, and that the Wahabi Government considers a friendly letter to be synonymous with a Treaty Agreement. ...' Government of India and Turkish Claims to Suzerainty, 1866. 121. In connection with the Sur disturbances Sir Lewis Pelly appears to have suggested that Turkish interference should be invoked against the Wahabi Amir. The Government of India, on 11th June 1866, recorded the following comments G. of I. to on proposal. ' . . . The Government of India entirely concurs with the Bo., No. 602, Government of Bombay in discountenancing Lt.-Col. Felly's suggestion that the 11.6.66. interference of the Turkish Government should be invoked. No good, but much harm, would result from the question of Turkish supremacy over the Wahabi territory being imported into our relations with the latter power. It has always been our policy (see letter from H.B.M. Consul-General at Bagdad to our Ambassador at Constantinople, dated 1st January 1862) [paragraph 108 above], to repudiate the Porte's claim to authority in that quarter ; and the Governor-General in Council is satisfied that any deviation from the principle will give rise to complications much to be deprecated.' 122. There were no further developments of importance between 1866 and the fall of Baraimi in 1869. Summary , 1840-1870. 123. At the beginning of this period the Wahabis were subject to the Egyptians. Between 1843 and 1865 they reasserted themselves, re-established themselves (though not apparently on the same scale or with the same influence as in the past) in Trucial Oman, were deterred from annexing Bahrein only by British interference, and conducted operations against Muscat. The Government of India found it necessary to remind them of the independence of the Trucial Sheikhs, and of the special relations between H.M. Government and those Sheikhs (1853, 1855) to defend Bahrein against them (1850-51, 1859), to intervene to prevent them from aggression on Muscat, and to conduct effective expeditions against them or their proteges in 1861 ■&lt;IF 25 md 1865-66. During the whole of period they appear to have paid tribute to Turkey; notably in 1855, but also in 1859, they formally claimed to be 1 urkish dependants, and in 1866 they appealed to Turkey. On the death of the Amir Feisal in 1865 dissensions in the ruling house prepared the way lor the invasion of the Turks in 1870 and the fall of the Saudi dynasty. Throughout this period the Trucial Sheikhs remain to a not inconsiderable extent under Wahabi influence, but retain their independence, and from 1845 to 1869 the Wahabis are in possession of Baraimi and use it as their base in Trucial Oman. '1 he independence of Bahrein (and with it the relative independence of Qatar) is consistently maintained; Koweit falls outside the Wahabi sphere, and Muscat remains, as in the past, an independent State. jjj 1870—1901. From the Fall of Baraimi and the Turkish Occupation of Hasa to the Capture of Riyadh by Ibn Saud. Abortive Wahahi Plans to recover Baraimi, 1870-1871. 124. It is unnecessary for the purpose of the matters now specially under W cousideration to examine the history of this period in any very great detail. Suffice it to say that in 1870-71 active steps were in contemplation by the Wahabi Amirs for the restoration of Baraimi, which at one time caused some^ apprehension to the Government of India and to the Irucial Sheikhs. In 1670 the 1 rucial Sheikhs, having been approached by the Wahabi Amir with a view to an attack on the fort, returned conciliatory answers, with the exception of Abu Dhabi. 1 he internecine quarrels of the Wahabi ruling family, closely followed by a Turkish expedition into Nejd in 1870 to assist the Amir Abdulla against his brother Sand, led to the abandonment of the prosecution of the war against Oman. Baraimi remained under the control of Abu Dhabi; the Trucial Sheikhs emerged from any form of Wahabi control or influence ; Wahabi influence outside Nejd and Hasa disappeared, and matters remained in this state throughout the whole of the period now under consideration. Turkish Occupation of llasa, 1871. 125. It may, however, be recorded that in 1870 the Amir Abdulla, having been defeated by his brother, himself appealed to the Turks, with the result that a Turkish expedition occupied Hasa in 1871. In the same year the 1 urks ceased, even in appearance, to act on behalf of the Amir Abdulla, and a notification was issued that the ' El Saud has ceased to reign' and that a Turkish official was appointed Governor of Nejd, and the Amir Abdulla fled to Riyadh. Wahahi Appeals to Great Britain, 1871-1873. 126. In September of 1871, Saud bin Feisal protested to the Political Resident against the activities of the Turks in the Gull waters. He urged that the peace ol those waters was under British protection and begged for British arbitration, a request which was refused. Between 1871 and 1873 no fewer than four letters were received by the Resident from Saud, in which he represented that he had been ' easy as regards the sea coast in reliance to your answer, the sea being in your charge and protection. . . . The sea is under charge of the Resident, and I was careless about the sea owing to his word.'' ... ' The Sircar 15 - • • is 'bound to keep peace.' The Government of India informed the acting Resident in the Persian Gulf, with reference to these letters, that unless Saud ' was a party to the so-called maritime truce or had otherwise received assurances from the British Government he was mistaken in supposing that the British Government bad undertaken to protect his territories from attack by sea.' The Resident was instructed to report whether anything had been said or done at any time to commit the British Government, directly or indirectly, to defend him or to use their influence to prevent attacks being made upon him by sea. Ihe report when received showed that Saud was not a party to the maritime truce and that the British Government had in no way been committed to protecting him by sea. Later communications from Saud showed that he now understood the position and merely hoped for the good wishes and friendship of the British Government, and it w as left to the Resident in these circumstances to answer Saud's latest letter, either then or afterwards, in general terms, expressive of goodwill.

Amir Sand and the Turks, 1872-1873. 127. A brief reference may be made to the relations between Saud and the Turks as bearing on the question of the relation of the ^audi dynasty to the iurkish Nejd Precis, power. In 1872 it was reported that the terms of the understanding contemplated § 150-6. W ere to be his recognition as the Chief of Nejd on condition of his paying the Turkish war expenses and the same yearly tribute as had been paid by the Amir Feisul. There were certain supplementary conditions which are immaterial. Both he and the Turks professed their anxiet}^ for a settlement on this basis, but no conclusion was reached. In 1872 a letter from Saud offered to invest the Resident with full power of mediation with the Turks, but the negotiations which succeeded again came to no conclusion. In 1873 Saud, now in a stronger position in Nejd, sent Abdul Rahman, the father of the present Saudi King, to Bagdad, with a view to the reaching of an agreement. Abdul Rahman was treated as a hostage and Pol. A. detained until 1874, but negotiations proved unfruitful. In 1875 Saud died and Sept. 1875, Abdul Rahman was elected Amir of the kingdom of Riyadh ' by the general 53 ~ 8 - consent of the people.' Internecine quarrels between members of the Saudi family continued from 1875 to 1880, but in the latter year it was reported that Abdulla and his nephews (including Abdul Rahman) were living in peace and friendship. The nephews possessed Kharj, 1 lotah, Hank, Aflaj, &amp;c., and had followers of the Ajman, Murra and Dowasir tribes. Rise of the Ihn Rashid Family. 128. In 1881, however, the Ibn Rashid dynasty, assisted by the divisions among the Saudis, gradually established themselves in control in Nejd, and the Saudis, who in 1879 had been reported to exercise control only in Riyadh and the district round it, sank into obscurity for 20 years. 1 he Ibn Rashid dynasty of Hail had from 1832 occupied the Jebel Shammar and its Sheikhs had paid homage to the v ■. p - • Saudis. The homage to the Saudis was gradually abandoned with the decay of Nejd i recis, ^ Wahabi g tate) and iu 187 g R as hid is described as the greatest prince in Nejd.' In 1888 Ibn Rashid decisively defeated the Saudis and captured Riyadh, and his dynasty remained in complete control in ^vejd until 1901. It may be recorded, however, that in 1890-91, on the Saudis regaining Riyadh, both parties N';'IP vis wrote to the Mutasarrif of Hasa, Ibn Rashid to denounce Abdul Rahman as § 217. meditating an attack on Flasa \ Abdul Rahman complaining of Ibn Rash id an( Extl. A: professing his obedience to the Turkish authorities, who were disposed to listen Nov. 1890, favourably to him.' The Ibn Rashid family throughout professed allegiance to the 189l' e 'Turkish Government, though Turkish influence in their dominions appears to have ' ' been of the smallest; and even on the occasion of his capture of Riyadh in 1888 Ibn Rashid posed as the officer or lieutenant of the Ottoman Government. Consolidation of British Position on the Arab Littoral of the Gulf, 1870-1901. 129. Between 1870 and 1901 H.M. Government had substantially strengthened I their position on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf. In 1880 they had entered into an exclusive agreement with the Sheikhs ol Bahrein; in 188/ corresponding agreements were concluded with the Trucial Sheikhs. In 1892 the agreements both with Bahrein and with the Trucial Sheikhdoms were confirmed and strengthened and control of the foreign relations of all the rulers in question passed into the hands of the British Government. Muscat, which had entered into a revised Commercial Treaty with Great Britain in 1891, in 1899 agreed never to cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation, save to the British Govern ment, any portion of its territories—an understanding which had at an earlier stag*? been secured from the Trucial Sheikhs and Bahrein. In 1899 the British Government for the first time established relations on the basis of a positive written engagement with the Sheikh of Koweit and laid the foundations of the situation which emergea 14 years later in the acknowledgment by Turkey under the Anglo-Turkisn Convention of 1913 of the autonomy of the Sheikhs of that principality. Turkey established herself in Qatar in 1871 and remained in control through 0111 the period 1871-1901. Her claim to the principality was never recognised by H.M. Government, and considerable correspondence with the Turkish Government took place during this period in connection with it.27 jy,—1901-1914. From the Capture of Riyadh by Ibn Saud to the outbreak of the Great War. 130. Between 1901 and 1913 Ibn Sand considerably reduced the importance of the Ibn Raslrid family and established himself in Nejd. In 1913 lie drove the Turkish garrisons out of Hasa. During almost the whole of this period he was in frequent contact with II.M. Government, his object being to secure their protection against the Turks. It may perhaps be well, in the interests both of illustrating the terms which he was prepared to offer in return for British protection and of placing on record the various statements made by him during this period as to his maximum ambitions, his attitude towards the area to the east of the Kejd-Hasa border, and to the States of the Arab littoral, and his view of his position vis-d-vis the Turks, to record in greater detail than would otherwise be justifiable the sequence of events and the more important correspondence which passed. 131. In January 1901 Ibn Saud took Ibn Rashid by surprise and conquered Riyadh. He appears to have made overtures to the Political Resident late in 1903 with a view to ascertaining whether he could look for British protection in the event of his conquering Hasa. The Government of India thereupon took up the _ question of sending a European officer to Riyadh for the purpose of collecting il intelligence. They were instructed by H.M. Government that no steps should be taken to enter into closer relations with Nejd or to send an Agent there without prior sanction, and in the light of the Resident's views, which were also hostile, they did not proceed with the proposal. Ihn Sand appeals for British Protection, 1904. 132. In May 1904, on the Turks taking active steps to support Ibn Rashid, a protest against the Turkish invasion was received from Ibn Saud, who solicited the yj c tel protection of Great Britain for his country and himself. No answer seems to have 20.5.04. been given to these overtures, which were made through the Political Resident. Influence of Ahu Dhahi in the Hinterland of the Trvcial Coast, 1904. 133. The Political Resident in June 1904 drew attention to the preponderating influence which the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi had recently been exercising in the J! 1 ' 0, hinterland of the Trucial Coast and referred to the fact that the Sheikh had &gt;8 6 04 concluded agreements with the inland Bedouin tribes such as the Beni Khatab, Ghofleh, Khavater, &amp;c. Policy of H.M. Government, 1904. 134. In September 1904 Ibn Rashid and the Turkish troops accompanying him P. 2188 a /04. were completely routed by Ibn Saud. The Political Agent, Koweit, asked by the Bie.toG.ofl. Sheikh what advice he should give Ibn Saud, who had enquired whether or not to ' !! ' write to the Turks on the matter, replied that Ibn Saud must consult his own interests and act as he thought best, and that in the absence of instructions from H.M. Government neither the Political Agent nor the Sheikh could give him any advice. 135. On 30th December 1904 the Secretary of State for India telegraphed to p. 8499/04. the Viceroy that ' H.M. Government desire that it should be clearly understood that their interest and influence are to be confined strictly to the coast line of Eastern Arabia, and that nothing should be said or done to connect them even indirectly with the warfare now in progress in the interior.' Saudi Agreement with the Turks, 1905. 136. In February 1905 a meeting took place at Koweit between the Sheikh, the Turkish Wali of Basra and Ibn Sand's father. The latter is stated to have wade a humble submission to the Sultan in his own name and that of his son, Abdul Aziz, professing loyalty and devotion to his sovereign and his readiness to obey his commands, and stating that he was prepared to do all he could to assist the Turkish expedition to Qasim. He protested that Ibn Rashid was his enemy ^d was inciting the Turkish Government against him. After preliminary discussions the Turkish representative produced an order from Constantinople, af idressed to Ibn Saud, appointing him ruler of Nejd on behalf of the Turkish 3076 jj Const, to F.O., tel. of 12.2.05 and 17.2.05.

Projected Visit hy Ihn Saud to Trucial Coast, 1905-1906. 138. Towards the end of 1905 information was received that Ibn Saud had visited Katr (still nominally under Turkish rule) and composed certain tribal disputes there, and that he was meditating a visit to the Trncial Coast and to Bre. lr. 513 Muscat.

G. ofi. Desp. 139. The Government of India were seriously disturbed as to the possible effect P 285/06 011 0Ur P 08 ^ 011 ou . t ^ le Trucial Coast and in Muscat of a visit by Ibn Saud. S. of 's. If-M. Government in the light of their views decided after consultation with the Desp. i5. Ambassador at Constantinople that if Ibn Saud appeared on the coast and failed to 13.4.06, give satisfactory assurances as to his intentions, he should be warned that any P. 2834/06. attempt on his part to interfere in Oman or along the Arab coast, either with the Chiefs or with their subjects, would be regarded as an unfriendly act and that Bre. lr. 51 steps would bo taken to frustrate it. Before these instructions were received, of 4.2.06, ''ercy Cox had conveyed a hint in this sense to Ibn Saud through the Sheikh P. 535/06. of Koweit (who regarded the proposed visit as a mere attempt to blackmail the coastal Chiefs). The visit, probably owing to the unsettled situation in Nejd, was abandoned. It should be recorded that, on the instructions of H.M. Government, the Lruciai Sheikhs were in the same connection warned by the Resident that, on the ground that general unrest prejudicial to British commercial interests on the Coast would inevitably result, the Government of India would not view with complacency the intrigues of any of them with Ibn Saud. Defeat of Ihn Rashid, May 1906. Const, to 140. In May 1906 Ibn Rashid and his immediate following of 250 were KO., 292, surprised and annihilated in Qasim by Ibn Saud, and Ibn Saud was reported from Jedda m June ot that year to have declared himself, consequent on his victory, ruler of the whole 'Shark' (East) and to have sent letters to Constantinople, asrah, Bagdad, the Hedjaz, and the Sherif of Mecca. Sir Nicholas O'Conor doubted, howeyei, whether Ibn Saud would be able to cope with the Turks, ' should he decide to proclaim his independence of the Sultan.' Turkish Allowances to Ibn Saud. 141. In August 1906 the Consul at Basrah reported that the allowance granted Koweit to j/ 1 t ? r 11 Sa ; u( ? was a recent arr angement paid through the Sheikh of Resdt.,' Koweit who deducted it from the land tax on his Fao property. The Sheikh 30.9.06. stated that the allowances paid by the Turks were 90 liras a month to Ibn Sand 's lather and 200 liras and about 300 tons of rice to Ibn Rashid. In October 1906 ^ Resident at Bagdad reported a statement that Ibn Saud had in the past received ctl.30 a month from Turkey, with 100 suits of clothes and some grain-an allowance now alleged to have been discontinued.29 Withdrawal of Turks from Qasim, September 1906. 142. Tn September 1906 inconclusive negotiations took place between the Cwngt to Turkish Commander of Qasim and Ibn Sand, and at the end of that year most F.O., 824, of the Turkish troops were reported to have been withdrawn from Qasim, a step 27.12.06. which was regarded as a definite success for Ibn Saud. Fiirther Overtures hy Ihn Saud to H.M. Government, 1906. 143. As stated above, no reply was sent to the overtures made to H.M. Government on behalf of Ibn Saud in 1904. Further indirect approaches having been made through various channels during 1906 with a view to ascertaining whether H.M. Government would be prepared to give him protection at any rate by sea to the same extent as it was accorded to the Sheikh of Koweit and other Arab Rulers of the Gulf in the event of his driving the Turks out of Hasa and Nejd, the Political Resident in September raised the general question of policy. Major Cox Bre. toG. said that he was aware that ' it has been a recognised principle of their (H.M. of I. 2181 Government 's) policy not to allow themselves to become involved in the tempestuous p 6 '^ 6 ^ politics of Central Arabia,' but expressed the view that it might be unwise to carry ' aloofness too far. He suggested that an understanding with Ibn Saud would be of advantage in various ways, and that if we had any intention ' of establishing some measure of friendly intercourse with the Ruler of Nejd, the present seems to be the time for us to do so.' Attitude of H.M. Government, 1906. 144. Lord Morley, then Secretary of State for India, replied, however, that H.M. Government maintained the view that their interests and influence should be 9 ^ Qg VlC '' confined to the coast, and that no steps should be taken to enter into relations with Nejd or to send agents into the interior without his previous sanction. Further Overtures to H.M. Government, 1906. 145. Towards the end of 1906 further indirect overtures on behalf of Ibn Saud were received through the Sheikh of Koweit and the Sheikh of Qatar. The Resident reported that from the statements made by the latter it appeared that the Saud ' considers that the oases of Hasa and Katif were always the most profitable possessions of his Wahabi ancestors. He is anxious to recover the two districts and d he proposes that a secret understanding should be arranged between the P to G - British Government and himself under which he should be o-mntPfl Rritisdi ot 1 ' granted British 24.11.06, protection from Turkish assaults by sea in the event of his ever driving the Turks, p. 2719/06 -. unaided, out of his ancestral dominions. In return for this protection the Amir 2.12.06, is willing to bind himself to certain agreements (probably similar to those of the P- 2799/06. Trucial Chiefs) and to accept a Political Officer to reside at his Court. . . . Ibn vSaud is determined to make an effort to obtain possession of Hasa and Katif. He proposes, therefore, in the first place, to apply to the Sultan for the Mutasariflik (Governorship) of the districts, and to throw off the Turkish yoke as soon as he considers the moment favourable, after establishing himself. If his application is refused he will invade the districts as soon as he is ready and having captured them will appeal openly to the British Government for protection.' Murder of Muta'ad ihn Rashid, January 1907. 146. In January 1907 Muta'ad ibn Rashid, the young Amir of Hail, who had p. 2660/07. succeeded his father in the Principality of Jabel Shammar at Hail in September 1906, was murdered by his kinsman Sultan ibn Rashid. Further Consideration of Policy towards Ihn Saud, 1907. 147. On 21st February 1907 the Government of India, in the light of the Resident 's reports, again raised the question of the policy to be adopted towards Ibn Saud. They suggested that if the Turks were really likely to disappear from the stage and Ibn Saud to be a power in the land, 'it seemed desirable that this De8p .No .28, Chief should, when a suitable moment arrives, be led to a friendly understanding 21 - 2 07 - with us.' But on a review of the various factors in the situation, they expressed ^e opinion that no immediate response to the advances reported by the Resident was necessary and that the answer to Ibn Sand's reiterated enquiries might be that30 Uesp. No. 11 to G. of I., 3.5.C7. P. 2938/07. Basra to Const., No. 32, 6.5.08. Const, to F.O., No. 585, 22.7,09. H.M. Government, 'while anxious to maintain friendly relations with him so bug as he comports himself in a manner consonant with British interests and our engagements with the Arab Sheikhs on the coast, see no necessity under present conditions for making him any formal promises of protection, which might even have the effect of stimulating Turkish opposition to the consolidation of his authority.' 148. The Ambassador at Constantinople, Sir Nicholas O'Conor, thought that our right policy was ' to intervene as little as possible in the internal affairs of these tribes and let them work out their own destiny as best they can,' 1 to wait on events and to modify our policy if subsequently a closer understanding with Ibn Saud seemed desirable. With this view H.M. Government agreed, and they instructed the Government of India that they saw no reason to modify their earlier policy that British interests and influence in this region should be strictly conlined to the coast. If it was quite inevitable to give an answer to Ibn Sand's enquiries, the answer should be that as Ibn Sand's proposals involved considerations which it was impossible for H.M. Government to entertain, no reply was to be expected to them. Ihn Rashid is defeated and abandons Qasim, 1907-1908. 149. In October 1907 Ibn Rashid was decisively defeated by Ibn Saud and besieged by him in Boreida ; and in February 1908 Ibn Rashid entered into negotiations with Ibn Saud and abandoned Qasim to him. Ibn Saud settles Tribal Disputes in Hasa at request of Turks (1908). His ascendency in Nejd. 150. In May 1908 Ibn Saud was asked by the Turkish Wali of Basra to settle certain tribal differences in Hasa in the Arab way. In July of the same year Sultan Ibn Rashid, himself the murderer in April 1906 of Mita'ad Ibn Rashid, was murdered by his brother Saud, who succeeded as Amir and made overtures to Ibn Saud. But by September of that year the Consul at Damascus reported that Damascus to ' Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud has become practically the undisputed Amir of Nejd, with 23 9 S 08 ascendanc y recognised in Riyadh, Qasim and by all the Bedouin tribes of Nejd. No 48 Even Saud Ibn Rashid himself admits that his Amirate of Hail is only a vassalage under the suzerainty of Ibn Saud.' In the same month Saud Ibn Rashid was overthrown, and the Amirate reverted to a minor under a Regency. But by January 1909 the Ibn Rashid faction had to some extent consolidated themselves. Ibn Saud and the Turks, July 1909. 151. In July 1909 Ibn Sand's agent at Bagdad,, in the course of a discussion with the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia, remarked that 'Abdul Aziz had thought of approaching the Sultan with the suggestion that he should tly the Turkish flag, pay a certain amount of tribute to the Turkish Government, and he recognised as the Governor of the whole of Arabia,' and had actually sent an emissary to take soundings, who had reached Basra, but had returned to Nejd on the news of the Young Turk coup d'etat of April 1909. Ibn Sand's object and that of many Arabs was Arab independence. If they could not secure this they would ^ prefer the supremacy of a foreign Power to that of the Turks, and the emissary clearly indicated that the Power they had in view was the British Government. First Conversations between Ibn Saud and Captain Shakespear, 1911. 152. In the spring of 1911 conversations of much importance, though of a Bre. to G. of wholly informal character, took place between Ibn Saud and Captain Shakespear, I., 20.4.11. then Political Agent, Koweit. Captain Shakespear was the first European whom Ibn Saud had met, and close personal relations appear at once to have been established between them. The Amir described his position and his ambitions in great detail. The following extracts from Captain Shakespear's Report of the conversation are of interest as illustrating Ibn Sand's view as to the previous relations of the Wahabi rulers with the British Government, his own relations with Turkey and his attitude to the Trucial Sheikhs :— ' . . . After the Egyptians had been expelled from Nejd, his ancestor, Turki-Bin-Abdulla, had re-created most of the original Wahabi dominion, including Hasa, Katif and most of the Oman coast from Qatar to near JViuscat, . . . and had then made a treaty with the British Government . .31 '... The Amir Feisal bio Turki, on obtaining a pardon from the Egyptians and returning to Nejd in 1842, was at once acclaimed as Imam. He also renewed the old treaty with the British Government.' '... the British Government showed how close were their relations with Nejd by sending one of their officers, Colonel Lewis Pelly, to Riyadh, and be renewed the old treaties and friendship, though not by an actual written document.' . . . Since the evacuation of Qasim by the Turks in 1906 there have been no signs of Turkish authorit} 7 in Nejd and Abdul Aziz has so con solidated his power that his word is law over the whole of Nejd from within two days' march of Hail to the Persian Gulf coast line excepting only the actual towns of Hofuf, Katif, and where the Turks maintained garrisons, and as far south as the Wadi Dowasir. . . . He asserts that he had made no professions [at the time of an expedition against him in 1910 by the Sherif of Mecca] of being the vassal of the Sultan, and being a Wahabi does not admit the Sultan's Khalifate in Islam. . . . The As Saud . . . above all desired to be in relations with the British Government so that the Turkish Govern ment would hesitate to oppress them or tc interfere in their affairs in Nejd. . . . The new regime in Constantinople had already shown their aggressive policy, and he feared that before very many years there would be another attempt to subjugate Nejd. Though the Wahabis had formerly fought us in regard to the coastal Chiefs' affairs, they saw the benefit of our rule amongst them and had no wish to alter the present position, though Abdul Aziz mentioned having received a letter from Dibai, whose Sheikhs had written, after the Hyacinth gun-running incident, asking to be taken under his protection. On enquiring how he reconciled the regular receipt of a Turkish annuity with the claim to absolute independence, Abdul Aziz said that the annuity dated from the time of his father's incarceration in Bagdad, was given then for his living expenses, and has continued ever since as personal to Abdul Rahman ; it amounts to only £T.60 per mensem. The As Saud have never received anything else from the Turks in the way of subsidies, and on his father's death Abdul Aziz proposes to allow his subsidy to lapse. All the correspondence they had had with the Turkish officials has been of a diplomatic nature, either to effect the removal of troops on the pretext of a show of submission, or to settle any other difficulties as they arose.' 153. The question of policy was again considered between the India Office and the Foreign Office on the receipt of Captain Shakespear's report. It was agreed, however, that it seemed preferable to hold to the existing policy unless the Govern ment of India should propose a departure from it, when the question could be again considered. British Negotiations with Turkey, 1911-1913. 154. Between 1911 and 1913 H.M. Government were engaged in .negotiations with the Turkish Government on the various matters in dispute between them in the Persian Gulf area, which culminated in the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of July ouM 1913 (paragraph 165) and March 1914 (paragraph i79). Further meeting between Captain Shakespear and Ihn Saud, May 1913. 155. On 15th May 1913 Captain Shakespear, then Political Agent, Koweit, ot reported that he had met Ibn Saud in the course of a recent tour, in the Koweit 5 13' hinterland, and had spent four days with him. In the course of the visit p. 2448/13. Ibn Saud had discussed his future policy with great frankness with Captain ^hakespear, who was in close personal relations with him. Captain Shakespear submitted a detailed report of his discussions, from which the following extracts, bearing on the matters now under discussion, are relevant:— 156. He, Ibn Saud, according to Captain Shakespear, stated that ' his power ln Central Arabia had increased till he no longer feared any of its Sheikhs or fulers; he was, moreover, in alliance with all of them, excepting only one, viz. : Capt. the Sharif of Mecca, who, fearing a second Wahabi invasion of the Hejaz, had Sh ^ kes P® ar therefore allied himself with the Turks. The As Saud were prepared to hold c K) 68 ' what they had recovered during the last 15 years of their ancient dominion in 15.5;13. Arabia, and felt capable of being able to do so comparatively easily but for the 3076 tI v - v - t -S r., u. r ^ ifcs^Wl 32 monaco of Turkinh aggression only possible from the East by way of Hasa and f rom the West by Mecca and Medina. To withstand the Turks from both &lt;11 rod ions they felt was beyond their strength, and to render secure their eastern borders, thus making their full force available lor the defence of their western bouudaries, was one of the reasons for their desire to evict the lurks trom Hasa and Kalif. Another most important one was that possession of these rich disl riots, wit h their ports, and especially Ojair, would furnish a valuable source of revenue. Moreover, the As Sand had other grounds, and just ones, for their claim to I lasa and Katif. One was that these districts formerly belonged to their house; another was that the Turks themselves, in a document given to Abdulla bin baiaal b\ Natiz Pasha, the General who commanded Midhat Pasha's oxpodition to Katif in 1871, had agreed that the area should belong to and be governed b\ Abdulla and his family. The Amir informed me that this document had onh recentIv oomo into his possession, and on his return to Riyadh he would send mo a oopv.' Another document of which he had heard, but so far had not suoooeded in tracing, was one which purported to be an agreement made by Colonel Sir Lewis Polly guaranteeing on behalf of the British Government that the Vs Sand family would be recognised as the Sheikhs of the Katif District. This dwumont, ho said, was the result of negotiations after the naval actional Katif and Panunam ^in 1865), when four men named Muhammad bin Ma'ana. Abdul \t\t bin I mr, Saloh A1 Widawi and Ibrahim bin Ghanim were sent by Faisai Vs Sand as his representatives to the Resident. I have no archives with which to test the aocunuv of the Amir's assertions, but I find a declaration imnted on page 156 of Aitchison s Treaties. Vol. XII. as Xo. XXVIII. which stvms u&gt; hear on this transaction.' I &gt;7, Captain Shakos pear in his report stated that while for want of early \\\vi\is ho was unaware of ihe earlier relations of H.M.

Government, which is to abstain strictly from intervention, direct or indirect, in the affairs of Nejd. The general attitude of H.M. Government, which in this matter is based on considerations of European policy, is to consolidate the power of the Central Government in Asiatic Turkey, and if H.M. Government were to approach the Ottoman Government, as suggested by Sir P. Cox, with a view to concluding direct agreements with Ibn Saud as an autonomous ruler, it would give rise to suspicion and might have far-reaching and regrettable effects.' Ihn Saud and the Trucial Area 1913. 161. On 18th June the Viceroy reported that Ibn Saud had sent an envoy to P. 2449/13. the Residency Agent at Shargah, bearing a letter to him and one for the Sheikh of Dabai, intimating that he had recovered without bloodshed 'the ancestral possessions of his forefathers, namely, Hasa and its dependencies, and had established peace and public security therein.' Overtures by Ihn Saud to H.M. Government, June 1913. ' IGw. On 13th June 1913 Ibn Saud wrote to Sir P. Cox informing him of the conquest of Hasa, and suggesting a friendly understanding. The following p.E.toG.of extract from his letter is of importance because of its reference both to an earlier I- No. 2048, British treaty with Wahabis and to the ' dependencies ' of Hasa, &amp;c. :— p 7 ^ 13 ' We beg to address Your Honour in consideration of the previous friendship between us and you and of the still earlier treaty belonging to the time of my grandfather, Faisal—may God forgive him—of the period of which 55 years have elapsed and 55 years still remain to run. I desire to establish the same in the same manner as it existed between you and my ancestors, and this (fact) has prompted me to make this reference. Firstly, I am confident that there will happen nothing to your people to produce causes which may be contrary to friendship and rules. And we have nowadays conquered the countries of our fathers and forefathers (viz.), El Hasa and El Katif, as well as their dependencies. ... I desire to be on the same terms with you as existed between you and my ancestors, and I desire that those terms should exist between me and you after them (my ancestors).' 163. Sir Percy Cox replied (9th July 1913) that the British Government P.R. toG.ot considered it necessary to observe a strictly neutral attitude towards both sides. }■&gt; 2249 ' No reference was made to the alleged treaties with the Amir Faisal. p 0 3441/13 Ihn Saud's Overtures to the Turks, July 1913. 1(34. On 11th July 1913 Sir P. Cox reported that an envoy from Ibn Saud had reached Bahrein en route for Basra with telegrams to Constantinople P. 2763/13. J* explaining that the Amir's action had been forced on him in the public interest, and that he entertained the utmost loyalty to the Sublime Porte. The Resident urged that H.M. Government should inform Ibn Saud that we should be glad to ?ee him reconciled to the Turks and to assist in promoting such reconciliation. ''-O. to I.O., The Porte could be informed that we had so replied. This proposal was supported by the Government of India and the India Office; but, the Foreign Office objecting p 2948/13 to the suggestion that we should offer to assist in promoting such reconciliation,' it was abandoned. A nglo -T urkish C onvention of 29 th J uly 1913. 165. In July 1913, as the result of the negotiations referred to in para. 150 above, a convention between Great Britain and Turkey was initialled, under which Turkey : («) recognised Koweit as an autonomous kaza of the Ottoman Empire and accepted as valid the Sheikh's agreements with H.M.

(c) agreed that the eastern boundary of the Turkish Sanjak of Nejd should be represented by a line, shown in blue on a map appended to the Convention, running due south from the head of the Gulf opposite Zaknuniyeh Island, which formed part of the said Sanjak, to the 20th parallel of latitude in the Rub'al Khali. Ihn Saud and Qatar; Apprehensions of the Trucial Sheikhs, July 1913. 166. On 1st August the Government of India reported the death on 17th July of the* Sheikh of Qatar, and stated that the Political Agent, Bahrein, had informed the Resident that while at Katif Ibn Saud had addressed the Sheikh of Qatar and demanded the expulsion of the Turkish garrison from A1 Bidaa. ' Residency Agent, Trucial Coast, reports that Sheikhs of Debai and Abu Dhabi, who are of the same tribe, have had a conference, and latter, who since the Wahabi evacuation has achieved a paramount position in Baraimi and neighbourhood, is convinced that Ibn Saud will now turn his activities in that direction. In this fear the two Sheikhs have decided to mobilise their Bedouins in the Sabakhat el Matti (vide page 1200, Persian Gulf Gazetteer) and take the initiative against Ibn Saud. There having been nothing unfriendly in our reply to Ibn Saud, I [Sir P. Cox] should not imagine that he would think it worth while to hostilize us by such action, but of course the state of Oman generally at present offers him a very favourable oppor tunity, if he be so disposed. I am warning Sheikhs of the improbability of such a development, and deterring them from provoking hostilities, but I should be glad to give them, if possible, something reassuring as to the attitude of the British Government towards a possible enterprise of this kind on the part of Ibn Saud.' British Guarantees to Qatar, 1913. 167. The Resident was instructed in reply that the new Sheikh of Qatar ' and, if necessary, Ibn Saud, should be informed that H.M. Government would allow no outside interference in the peninsula. Latter should clearly understand that if he attempts it, he will be forcibly resisted. Former may be told that he has nothing to fear from Turks.' H.M. Government and Ihn Saud as a Potential Danger in the Trucial Area, 1913. 168. On 7th August the Political Resident telegraphed to the Government inter alia that— ' At any rate for a long time to come the Porte can exercise no control whatever over Ibn Saud and that meanwhile he is in a position to give a varying deal of inconvenience alike in regard to Oman, the Trucial Coast and Katr, which inconvenience an innocuous modus vivendi, arranged n necessary with the knowledge of the Porte, would obviate. It is not a question of any desire to interfere in the politics of Central Arabia. Ibn Saud is now at the coast, and for us it is a question of a new menace to our interests in the Gulf sphere which we need either to sterilise or protects ourselves against.' Views of Government of India, August 1913. 169. The Viceroy on 10th August in a telegram commenting on the general situation, and urging a modification in the policy hitherto adopted by H.M. Government, said that— ' It is clear from his [Ibn Sand's] relations with the Sheikh of Katr and the recent reports as to the apprehensions of the Trucial Chiefs that It® Saud is becoming a more and more prominent factor in the politics of titf Persian Gulf littoral, and has thus brought himself within the sphere o our interests and influence. As lon^ as Ibn Saud confined himself to ^ Hasa he could be ignored with impunity. Such a policy, however, cannot m our-opinion safely be pursued now that there is a possibility of his in^ ference in El Katr, with the Trucial Chiefs, and possibly in Oman, whei^ the rebellion may give him an opportunity for encroachment on Musca territory. .... Unless we come to some mutual and amicable underW i ^ ( 35 standing with the Amir, who has hitherto been friendly disposed to us, the probability is that we shall force him to adopt an attitude of permanent hostility, which cannot but react unfavourably on the Chiefs of the littoral. We therefore strongly advocate not any definite treaty with the Amir, but a friendly interchange of views in which we should intimate to him that we expect him not to interfere with the territories of Chiefs with whom we have treaty or other relations on the Gulf littoral. We see no reason why if this were done with the full knowledge of the Porte, to whom our intentions could be clearly explained, there should be any risk of offending Turkish susceptibilities or raising their suspicions. We might warn the Trucial Chiefs seriously against any provocative action against the Amir, but instead of assuring them of immunity from him, which is only likely to encourage them to assume a truculent attitude towards him, we might tell them that our relations with the Amir are such that their fears of aggression on his part are groundless.' Views of H.M. Government, August 1913. 170. H.M. Government on consideration agreed generally with the Govern- i.o. to F.O., ment of India, and on the suggestion of the Secretary of State for India, Hakki 13.8.13. Pasha was also informally told that H.M. Government owing to the death of the ^ L0 '' Sheikh of Qatar and subsequent events must in order to carry out their obligations 3751043. make Ibn Sand either their friend or their enemy; that they could not afford to s. of S. to make him their enemy; and that they therefore proposed to enter into a friendly Vic., exchange of views with him in order to regularise the position—a communication 21 - 81 3. which the Pasha received in a friendly spirit and promised to communicate to his Government. 171. In September 1913 Ibn Saud, in reply to the Resident's letter of 9th July vie. to S. of (paragraph 163 above), asked for a clearer explanation of the British attitude. S., 5.9.13, Sir Percy Cox intimated on 11th September 1913 that it was somewhat difficult P. 3666/13 to give the explanations desired without fuller information as to Ibn Saud's wishes. He suggested a meeting, and added:— 'Meanwhile, I have my Government's authority to assure you that, pro vided you undertake on your part to abstain from all action calculated to disturb the status quo, or to create unrest, among the Arab Principalities Bre. to G. of whose rulers are in relation with the British Government, including the I-, -796, Principality of Katr, the independence of which under the Government of p &gt; the late Sheikh Jasim and his successors of the Bin Thani family has been recently recognised by the British and Turkish Governments, the British Government will continue to maintain the friendly relations which have been sustained in the past.' Attitude of Turkey: October—December 1913. 172. On 2nd October the Foreign Office intimated that a reply had been received from Hakki Pasha to the communication referred to in paragraph 170 F .o. to 1 .0., above, in which the Porte expressed their thanks for the friendly offer of H.M. 39902/13, Government stated that they were actually in negotiation with Ibn Saud, and p * 4062 lo added that if the necessity should arise for recourse to the good offices of H.M. Government the Porte would not fail to avail itself of them. 173. On 15th December the Ambassador at Constantinople reported that the Const, to Turkish Government had intimated that they proposed to recognise the recent fait ^ : 977 . accompli in Nejd by nominating Ibn Saud A1 Mutasarif of the district. p 1 56o2/l3 Discussion between Acting Political Resident, Captain Shakespear, and Ihn Saud: l§th December 1913. 174. Endeavours were made to arrange a meeting between the Political Resident and Ibn Saud towards the end of 1913, and on 16th December Major Trevor and Captain Shakespear met Ibn Saud and had an exhaustive discussion w ith him. The following points are taken from a memorandum of the interview which was read over to Ibn Saud and in the terms of which he concurred ;— 'His family, he said, had been in Nejd from time immemorial and had for generations ruled over it without interference from outside. He himself 3076 Kwas an Arab chief, whose views on matters of policy naturally differed from those of European powers. Bedouin tribes are not concerned in weighing the merits of different governments, as they live as nomads and when oppressed move off to another locality In recent years he had been able to consolidate his authority in Central Arabia and has now taken Hjisa and Qatif All he wants is to be left in peace and he sees that the British Government keeps the peace all along the coasts of the Persian Gulf, except in this small section of the coast of the Hasa province. If he could get an assurance that the British Government would maintain the maritime peace on this strip of coast and recognise his position as de facto ruler he would be satisfied, i f not, he would have to trust in his own sword In the discussion which followed Ibn Sand said he would be glad to co-operate with the British Government in the suppression of piracy and the illicit arms traffic and in the maintenance of the maritime truce and would also agree not to interfere in the politics of Qatar and the Tiucial Coast and to admit British subjects and representatives in his-territory, provided that the British Government would give him the assurances mentioned above. In fact, he went further than this and said he would be willing to consult the British Government in all matters if he received these assurances. We again repeated that it was quite impossible to give him any such assurance. In the course of his remarks Ibn Saud pointed out that though he claimed Trucial Oman and Qatar as part of his ancestral dominions and could make his power felt there, he was quite willing to meet the wishes of the British Government in regard to them. He hinted that the only reason which restrained him from overrunning Qatar and possibly Trucial Oman after he had occupied Hasa and Qatif was his desire not to alienate the sympathy of the British Government.' 175. In a separate memorandum the negotiators recorded that Ibn &gt;aud, after the discussion on the subject of arranging a modus vivendi had been con cluded, enquired the policy of the British Government in regard to Qatar and the Trucial Oman States. We said that we could not make any definite pronouncement on the subject, but that as a general rule, as far as we v^eie aware, the policy of the Government was one of non-interference in internal matters. In the case of the Trucial Sheikhs we had certain agreements of long standing regarding the maritime truce, the slave trade and arms traffic, to which v»e held the Sheikhs, but we did not as a rule interfere with their rule on shore. As regards Qatar we translated to him the clause referring to that region in the recent Anglo- Turkish Convention and said that we assumed the British policy there would also be one of non -interference It proved that Ibn Saud s enquiry was due to the possibility that enemies of his might take refuge in some of these States and plot against him, and he enquired what the attitude of Government would be in regard txV such cases.' The negotiators were unable to state definitely, but promised to refer the matter to higher authority. ' He was apparently satisfied with this, but urged that the matter was important to him as affecting his authority over the adjacent Bedouin tribes. At any time in order to check the intrigues of such people, it might be necessary for him to take reprisals, and this might involve him with the British Government, which he was anxious to avoid. The nego tiators recorded that Ibn Saud had also said 'in a more informal manner that he would not interfere in the politics of Qatar and the Trucial Coast States. Views of Political Resident. 176 Mr. Lorimer, in forwarding this report, suggested the desirability, in the event of a mutual arrangement being reached between H.M. Government and Ibn Saud, of disposing of the question of his relations with the Sheikhs of Qatar and Trucial Oman and that of the control of refugees from his authority who settled under their protection. ' These questions arise from Ibn Sand's own position as an Arab chief and do not concern the Turks. It might be arranged with Ibn Saud. on condition of his not entering the territory of the said Sheikhs without our consent, that we should use our influence to prevent or restrain refugees whose conduct in their chosen places of residence is shown to be injurious to Ibn Sand's legitimate interests''if I 177. Endeavours were meanwhile proceeding in London to assist in the reachincr of an understanding between the Turks and Ibn Saud. A memorandum drawn ^up by Sir Percy Cox and communicated to Hakki Pasha on 9th March 1914 remarked that our requirements of Ibn Saud for the maintenance and protection of our interests included inter alia 'that he should not meddle m the territory or politics of Arab principalities in the Gull, including the 1 rucial Coast and Qatar.' Hakki Pasha replied that he must refer the matter to his Government, and the Resident was instructed to inform Ibn .Saud that 1 . ; vi. Government were endeavouring to effect an arrangement with the lurkisli Government and to warn him not to act independently. The Ambassador m Constantinople on 2nd April 1914 urged the desirability of watching the situation and awaiting further developments, the Turkish Government having intimated that they had a strong hope of coming to a settlement themselves. T reaty of 15 th M ay 1914 between I bn S aud and T urkey. 178. On 15th Mav 1914 a treaty (the original of which was found during the war among Turkish records at Basra) was concluded between Ibn Saud am. the Turkish Government. The text of the treaty is reproduced in Appendix A. p.z. 4569/16 It will be seen that it proceeds on the basis that Ibn Saud is a 1 urkish subject and vassal. A nglo -T urkish C onvention of 9 th M arch 1914. 179. On 9th March 1914 H.M. Government concluded a further Convention (ratified on 3rd June 1914) with Turkey, which provided that the line separating British and Turkish Spheres in South-Western Arabia should rejoin dans le Aitch. xji, Ruba-al-Khali, sur le parallele 20°, la ligne droite et directe vers le sud qui part d un point sur la rive meridionale du golfe d Oudjeir et qui sepai e le teiiitone Ottoman du sandjak de Nedjd du territoire d'El Katr, en conformite de 1' article 11 de la Convention anglo-ottomane du 29 juillet 1913 relatif an ( joijx Persique et aux territoires environnants.' 180. On 4th June 1914 the Foreign Office, the news of the conclusion of Ibn Saud's treaty with Turkey not yet having been made public, strongly urged r.O. to l.O., the importance of avoiding any action which might lend colour to suspicions that 4.6.1 k H.M. Government were supporting Ibn Saud's policy of 'making himself independent,' and in the same connection referred to him as a 1 urkish subject and specifically recognised as such by the Anglo-T urkish C onvention of 29tli July 1913. Sir E. Grey is, in fact, convinced that it would not be compatible with our engagements that Ibn Saud should be treated otherwise, or that independent communications with him should be held except in cases where they cannot be avoided.'' S ummary , 1901 to 1914. 181. From the above it will be seen that Ibn Saud, emerging as the repre sentative of the Saudi family and capturing Riyadh from Ibn Rashid in 1901, by 1913 had consolidated his position in Nejd, and in the same year drove the Turks out of Hasa. His repeated overtures to H.M. Government between 1901 and 1913 with a view to securing their protection against the Turks had no result. In May 1914 he accepted the position of Turkish Wali of Nejd and concluded an understanding with a duly authorised Turkish representative, the basis of which was that he was an Ottoman subject and lieutenant of the Ottoman f'orte in this area. V.—From the outbreak of the Great War to the opening* ol the Blue Line Discussions, 1914-1934. British Offers to Ihn Saud in return for his Co -operation against Turkey. 182. The importance of securing the support of Ibn Saud and the Arab Hulers of the Gulf (or, at any rate, of preventing them from giving active support *4 8/ i4 to the Turks) in the event of war with Turkey was patent; and H.M. Government decided that Ibn Saud should be informed that, in return for his co-operation38 P. 4902/14. Vic. tel., 2.1.15, P. 48/15. P. 697/15. To P.R., 4.1.15, No. S. 13.

Government would be prepared to recognise him as independent Tiuler of TSejd and Ilasa, and entei into treaty relations with him, and to guarantee him against attack by sea. Ihn Saud y s Response. 183. Ibn Saud on the outbreak of war took the field against his rival, Ibn Rashid, and used his preoccupations in this quarter as an excuse for not responding to the Turkish request for active military support against the Allies. It proved impossible to pursue discussions with him as to an undei standing on the lines referred to in the preceding paragraph until the end of 1914, when Captain Shakespear, on the instructions of H.M. Government, met and discussed the position with him. Ibn Saud intimated that he was entirely on the British side and that he would commence verbal negotiations on the subject of the offers made him by H.M. Government in the near future. In a lettei to the Political Resident of '28th November 1914 he referred to the British promise of recognition of his independence as ' Her recognition of the independence of my Chief ship of all the parts of Nejd, El Hasa and Katif. Ihn Sand's terms, January 1915. p 184 In January 1915 further discussions took place between Ibn Saud and Captain Shakespear. The Amir's attitude was that being ultimately dis appointed of British intervention on his behalf m April 1914, he was obliged to come to an understanding with the Turks sufficient to secure his immunity from their asrsrression. He was now anxious for a signed treaty gi\ing him a solid guarantee of his position under the aegis of Great Britain. If the treaty was not soon concluded, force of circumstances might drive him to give some overt demon stration of his intention to side with the Turks. On the other hand, once it was concluded he would use all his resources and influence on our side. He proposed a draft. 185 The following are the portions of the draft submitted b} Ibn ^aud, which bear on the question of his boundaries and of his abstention from inter ference with the territories of the Arab proteges of H.M. Government (1) That the British Government will acknowledge and admit that Nejd, El Hasa Katif, their surroundings and the ports appertaining to them on the shores of the Persian Gulf are to me and (are) the territory of my fathers and forefathers; that I am the independent ruler of them and after me my sons and their descendants by inheritance; and that the above -mentioned territory is an independent territory in which thei e is no (i igl^t o ) in ei ference bv any Foreign Power; &gt; • m ' (2) That they (the British Government) will declare its (the territory s boundaries north, south, east and west, by land and by sea, and that (regarding) the nomads who wander between neighbouring towns, whicti are either under British protection or (directly) under British Government, it there should arise differences between me and the Chiefs of the said towns and complaints be made in (these) matters, they should be decided according to the ownership of fathers and ancestors ' 186. Captain Shakespear, in his letter forwarding this draft, remarked that the addition to our responsibility did not appear heavy. The Turkish menace from the west and north of Nejd, though very real to Ibn Sand, need give us n anxietv; and while we should probably be called upon to act as arbiters somew^ more frequently than hitherto between Arab Sheikhs along the coast ana Saud, this was a duty largely to the advantage of our own interests. 187 Sir Percy Cox saw no special difficulty as regards the clauses referred to in paragraph 185 above, but remarked, as regards protection against externa aggression by land, that, ' apart from the Turks, Central Arabia is piac inaccessible by land to any power but ours, and I venture to think that we incur little risk by giving the desired undertaking, subject to the reservation that aggression be unprovoked. 1 ' Views of Government of India. 188. The Government of India pointed out that Ibn Sand's proposals involved many matters of detail which would require lengthy consideration, anf Q 39 suggested that we should aim at concluding a treaty on broad lines for the moment, accompanied by an undertaking to conclude, as soon as this could conveniently be arranged, a detailed treaty in regard to other matters outstanding. They suggested that the guarantee of independence should be to the effect that 'the British Government recognises Ibn Saud as independent ruler of Nejd, Hasa and Qatif, and guarantees hereditary succession to his dynasty ' 1 i .o. to F.O., HM. Government approved, but (on the proposal of the India Office) suggested 30.1.15 _ that the new treaty should also ' contain a clause binding Ibn Saud, subject to eventual definition of boundaries, not to interfere with Koweit, Bahrein, El Katr 2 2.15. and the Trucial Chiefs.' There is nothing on record to show the precise object Tel. to Vic., of the reference to a subsequent delimitation. 1.2.15. 189. Discussions were pursued on this basis between Sir Percy Cox and P.R. in Arkril 1 Ql Fi TV ip British Hrnft, rmd thpi draft finbmittftd bv Tbn Saud f*- to G. of Ibn Saud in April 1915. The British draft and the draft submitted by Ibn Saud ^ , 1 . on the points now under consideration were then as follows ;— p. 2832 15. British Draft. Ihn Saud's Draft. Article I. The British Govern ment do acknowledge and admit that Nejd, El Hasa and Qatif, and their territories and ports on the shores of the Persian Gulf are the territory of Ibn Saud and his fathers before him, and do hereby recognise the said Ibn Saud as the independent Ruler thereof, and after him his sons and descen dants, etc Article I. The British Govern ment do acknowledge and admit that Nejd, El Hasa, Qatif, Juhail, their dependencies and territories, which will he discussed and determined here after, and their territories and ports on the shores of the Persian Gulf are the countries of Ibn Saud and of his fathers before him, and do hereby recognise the said Ibn Saud as indepen dent Ruler thereof and as absolute chief of their tribes, and after him his sons, etc Article VI. Ibn Saud undertakes, as his fathers did before him, to refrain from all aggression on or interference with the territories of Koweit, Bahrain, the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman coast who are under the protection of the Exalted Government and have treaty relations, and the limits of their territories shall be hereafter deter mined. Article VI. Ibn Saud undertakes, as his fathers did before him, to refrain from all aggression on or interference with the territories of Koweit, Bahrain, Qatar and the Oman coast, or other tribes and Chiefs who are under the protection of the British Government, and the limits of whose territories shall be hereafter deter mined. 190. H.M. Government gave Sir Percy Cox a discretion as regards the p. 2966/15. alternatives suggested by Ibn Saud. A greement between Ibn Rashid and Ibn Saud, \0th June 1915. 191. On the 10th June 1915 Ibn Saud reached an agreement with Saud bin P. 772/16. Abdul Aziz Ibn Rashrd. Its terms are of some interest as showing the extent at the time of Ibn Saud's tribal claims. The agreement provided ' that Nejd and all the interior from A1 Kahaf to the valley of Duwasir and all territories of Ibn Saud and the encampments of Matair, Ataiba, Harb, Bani Abdulla, Ajman, A1 Morra, A1 Manasir, Bani Hajer, Sabia, A1 Sahul, Qahtauf, and A1 Duwasir, and everybody included among them, are subjects of Ibn Saud. I, Ibn Rashid, have nothing to do with them ' T reaty of 26 th D ecember 1915 between H.M. G overnment and I bn S aud. 192. After further discussions between Sir Percy Cox and Ibn Saud, a treaty p. 668/16. was finally signed on 26th December 1915. The Saudi draft of Article I, as set p.r . to G. of 0 ^t in paragraph 189 above, was accepted. It appeared that the reason for the L, No. 35 C., Saudi version was that Jubail was the locality where Ibn Saud's limits on the 311 6. J'Oast approached those claimed by Koweit, and that for that reason he wished to Aitch. XII, ^ave it specified. As it was well outside the boundary accepted by H.M. Govern- ment for Koweit in their negotiations with the Turks, Sir Percy Cox saw no pp ' ~ ' objection to its acceptance. 3076 L p ■ ■ * Sr I t &gt;•' B n illl40 Special 7. Aitch. XII, No. iii, pp.213—4. 193. In the case of Article VI, the Saudi draft, with a very slight verbal modification, was accepted. In its final form it ran as follows ' Ibn Sand undertakes, as his fathers did before him, to refrain from all aggression on or interference with the territories of Koweit, Bahrain, and of 'the Sheikhs of Katr and the Oman coast, who are under the protection of the British Government and who have treaty relations with the said Government, and the limits of their territories shall be hereafter determined.' The words ' other chiefs and tribes ' proposed in the original British draft quoted in paragraph 189 above were omitted in deference to Ibn ^aud s state ment that the several chiefs whom we did protect and had relations with were all mentioned, so that the words in question seemed unnecessary. 194. In Article VII, the British draft of which provided that a further detailed treaty should be concluded ' in regard to other matters jointly concerning the British Government and Ibn Saud, Ibn Saud successfully pressed for the omission of the word ' other.' He pointed out that some of the matters such as boundaries were among those already alluded to in the present treaty, so that there seemed no need to say 1 ' other. 195. From the above it will be seen that it was H.M. Government who them selves suggested the inclusion in the treaty of a provision for the subsequent determination and definition of the boundaries of the Persian Gulf States, our special relations with which Ibn Saud undertook to respect. Construction of Articles I and 11 of 1 reaty of 1915. 196. During 1916 Sharif Husain of Mecca wrote to Ibn Saud asking for an alliance and assistance. This overture was reported to Sir Percy Cox by the Amir of Neid, who expressed mistrust of the Sharif's intentions. As a result, Sir Percy Cox recommended on 8th September 1916 that Ibn Saud should be ' informed definitely that no present or future understanding between us and the Sharif would prejudice our adherence to the terms of Articles I and 11 of our treaty with him of 26th December 1915.' He was instructed in reply that 'as the policy of encouraging an Arab State or confederation of States was not dead, anything repudiating it should be avoided, and that reference to the treat) should be confined to Article I, as we could not admit that Article 11 was binding on us against other Arabs.' A verbal assurance on the lines indicated appears to have been given to Ibn Saud by Sir Percy Cox at Koweit on 21st November 1916. 197. The Foreign Office in a memorandum drawn up about this time remarked that the wording of Article I of the treaty in effect ' commits us to arbitrate on the territorial questions at issue between Ibn Saud and King Husain, and in the last resort to impose an effective sanction for our award.' Agreement of 1922 with Ibn Saud on Kjdweit Boundaries. 198. In 1922 an agreement was reached with Ibn Saud, who in that year overthrew the Rashid, in regard to the boundaries of Koweit. The agreemen referred in terms to the boundaries accepted by H.M. Government tor tn principality in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 29th July 1913, but ' ment between the two parties, and with the subsequent concurrence of the bneiK of Koweit, it varied those boundaries in favour of the Saudi ruler. Summary , 1914 to 1922. 199. During this period Ibn Saud in 1915 concluded a treaty with H .M. Government, in which the latter recognised him as the independent rule of Nejd, and he undertook not to interfere with the territories of their Ara proteges! By 1922 he had finally defeated and captured the representative o the Ibn Rashidi family. In the same year he entered into agreements under wm he received certain concessions in the Koweiti hinterland, and by whicn boundaries of Koweit, Nejd and Iraq were delimited.zrfS ■&gt; / 41 1922-1934. Representations by the Sheikh of Qatar, 1921-22. Ihn Saud warned to respect Qatar, 1922. 200. In 1921 the Sheikh of Qatar represented that he was alarmed lest some of his townspeople should become Akhwan and join Ibn Saud, and enquired whether H.M. Government would assist him should he be attacked from the interior. He was informed that H.M. Government were not prepared to promise p.g. 13. more than diplomatic assistance should Ibn Saud attack him. Late in 1922 he intimated that, while he did not fear an open attack by Ibn Saud so long as the latter remained on good terms with H.M. Government, he was seriously concerned by the more subtle methods employed, he alleged, by the Nejd authorities to undermine his position. The Resident suggested that a hint might be given to Ibn Saud to keep his people in order, but no action was taken on this proposal. In November-December 1922 Sir Percy Cox, finding that Ibn Saud proposed to include the whole of the peninsula of Qatar in a concession for oil in the Hasa district which was then under consideration, intimated to him that this could not be accepted and that he had nothing to do with Qatar except to respect it under the terms of his Treaty with us, and insisted on the limitation of his discussions to country west of the longitude of Salwa Bay. Sir P. Cox is stated by Lt.-Colonel H. R. P. Dickson, who was present, to have drawn on a map a line running from Djau-ed-Dukhan to Dohat-as-Salwa, which, he indicated, must represent the Eastern boundary of any concession granted by Ibn Saud in respect of Hasa. The Sultan accepted this injunction without argument. The line in question, it may be remarked, cuts across the Blue Line, which was never men tioned in the discussions. Sir Percy Cox has ^ince stated that, to the best of his recollection, nothing took place in his discussion with Ibn Saud which would prevent His Majesty's Government from claiming the Blue Line as the eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia. Reassertion of Wahahi influence in Trucial Oman and at Baraimi, 1922-34. 201. In 1922, when Sheikh Sultan bin Zaid murdered and succeeded his brother, the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, he found that the authority of his family in Baraimi, where it had been predominant since 1870, had fallen to a low ebb; and the Beni Naim of Baraimi were engaged in conflicts with Abu Dhabi. In June 1925 it was reported that the Awamir and the Dam had appealed to the Wahabi Amir of Hasa to protect them f rom Abu Dhabi, and in the same month it was reported that the Amir had sent an official to collect zakat in the Baraimi oasis, who was generally, but not invariably successful. This official also arrested and hanged a Hasawi refugee in Baraimi and notified the Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi and Debai that the Amir of Hasa had taken the Awamir and Daru tribes, who were fundamentally Muscat subjects, under the protection of the Sultan of Nejd. Anti-Wahahi combinations in Oman, 1925. 202. In July 1925 it appeared that the Sheikhs of the Beni Naim, Beni Khatib and the Beni Kaab had been negotiating with Shargah for mutual assist ance in the event of aggression by the Wahabis, and in August 1925, after a conference between Debai and the Imam of the fanatical Ibadhi tribes of the hinterland of Muscat, it was agreed that the two should support one another against the Wahabis. Further Wahahi activity, 1925-26. ^03. In December 1925 a letter received by the Sheikh of Debai from the Amir Hasa contained a serious threat against the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. In February 1926 the Amir of Hasa appears to have sent police to Shargah in pursuit of a Nejdi criminal. He was not found there and the police proceeded to Ajman and ^as al Khaimah. The man escaped detection. It was reported at the same time that Nejdi slavetraders were bringing negroes and war captives to the coastal 0wns for sale, and that the Trucial Sheikhs Avere afraid to interfere with them.

The Kazi sent his son to Hofuf to Pol. Res. to G. of L, 137 S , 30.4.27, P. 3996/27. Views of Political Resident, 1926. 204. The Political Resident expressed the view in 1926 that the region of Dhafra, some 14,000 miles square, which stretches 175 miles from west to east and 80 from north to south, bounded on the north by the Persian Gulf and on the south by the Rub al Khali, belonged, with three smaller coastal tracts to its west, historically and de jure to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. The first business of the Wahabis, if they were to establish themselves in Eastern Arabia, must be to absorb this region. East of it they would have little difficulty in procuring the adherence of the people of Baraimi, Haffit and Dhahirah, on account of the antipathy of some for Abu Dhabi and of others for the Ibadhi fanatics of the Muscat hinterland. He added that the kazis in all the chiefships except Abu Dhabi and Debai were actually Nejdis. 205. The Resident stated that the tribal situation was that Abu Dhabi and Debai were wholeheartedly opposed to Ibn Saud, and were followed by the Beni Yas and Manasir of Dhafra, Mijan, Akal, and the Dhawahir of Baraimi, Umm al Qaiwain, the Beni Khatib tribe and the Beni Kaab were inclined to be neutral. Shargah and Ras al Khaimah had a century earlier been bigoted Wahabis. Trucial Oman and the Wahabis, Ayril 1927. 206. A further report by Sir Lionel Haworth in the spring of 1927 confirmed that Debai and Abu Dhabi were opposed to Wahabism and had no desire to come under the sway of Ibn Saud, and stated that Ras al Khaimah and Shargah were closely sympathetic to the Wahabis, and that with them there might be bracketed the lesser chiefs of Ajman and Ummal Qaiwain. ' The latter four chiefs were actually Wahabis some hundred years ago, and are already in private communication with the Wahabi leaders.'

The oasis of Baraimi was, the Resident reported, occupied by three different sections of Arabs, the Naim, in close touch with Muscat and with no desire to be absorbed by the Wahabis; the villages belonging to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, partly occupied by the Dhawahir, and equally anti-Wahabi; and the El Shamis, a branch of the Naimi, in close touch with the chiefs of Ras al Khaimah and Shargah and strongly Wahabi in tone. ' The Baraimi section of this tribe have recently paid willing tribute to the Wahabi agent of the Governor of Hasa, who came to Baraimi, and they would encourage the extension of Wahabi power.' Of these sections, the first were the strongest and their chief occupied the fort at Baraimi. It will be seen that the pro-Wahabi element was in a minority and did not in 1927 occupy the fort, and this is of importance in estimating the weight to be attached to the payment of zakat to the Wahabis by Baraimi. 208. Later in the same year, however, the Baraimi Sheikhs, apparently acting under the influence of Ibn Saud's agent, and possibly apprehensive that P R. to Gr. of the presence of the Wazir of Muscat, Mr. Bertram Thomas, portended aggressions I., 181 S., by the Sultan, or that the establishment of a landing ground was likely to be a threat to their independence, refused to allow an R.A.F. party to reconnoitre the oasis. For convenience it may be recorded at this stage that despite this incident, however, no interference with the affairs of the Trucial Sheikhs by Ibn Saud's agent for Baraimi was reported in 1928-1931. In 1932, a cousin of the Sheikh of Baraimi having been ambushed by Bedouin consisting of Abu Dhabi subjects and Manasir tribesmen, hostilities broke out between Abu Dhabi. Baraimi and Dibai. Peace was restored after three months' fighting. It may be noted that there appears to have been no interference in this dispute by any representative of Ibn Saud and that the parties fought it out among themselves without any outside interference. There is no record since that date of Saudi 29.5.27, P. 3404/27. P.G. Ad. Reports, 1928-33. 210. with Ibn activities decided t of the T Sheikhdo had sine internati new draJ endeavou 211.

I he treaty of 1915 held the fiel until 1927. T he T reaty of J edda , 1927. nO In that year, after lengthy negotiations, a fresh treaty was concluded Aitch XII, I with Ibn Saud at Jedda on 20th May. H.M. Government, concerned by the 1 ► activities of the Amir of Hasa, to which reference is made in paras 201-207, decided to aim at the embodiment in any new treaty of the provisions of Article V I of the Treaty of 1915, binding Ibn Saud to respect the position of the Arab Sheikhdoms in alliance with H.M. Government, despite the fact that Ibn Saud had since the date of that treaty grown greatly both m strength and m international stature. They accordingly included that Article as Article VI m a new draft treaty, acceptance of which by Ibn Saud their negotiators weie o endeavour to secure. 211. The instructions to the negotiators remarked that the draft reproduced l.O. Desp. 'the provisions of Article VI of the treaty of 1916 save that no reference is ^ made to the question of determining the limits of the territory mentioned, p. 4 oo3/26. HM Government have given careful consideration to the question whetner Ibn Saud should be invited to refrain from aggression on the Rulers of the Persian Gulf Coast. It appeared to them doubtful whether in practice such an engagement would effectively deter Ibn Saud ii he were determined to absoib some petty neighbouring Arab State. Moreover, H.M. Government did not wish to commit themselves to recognise the extent of Ibn baud s domains oi to piotect territories outside those domains,-but would have preferred to lemain fiee to take what action they considered necessary in each particular case, ha\ ing i egard to the precise nature of their relations with the principality concerned and to other relevant circumstances.' In view, • however, of the recent instances of interference by the Amir of Hasa, referred to in paragraphs 201—207 above, H.M. Government ' came to the conclusion that ii Ibn Saud were not asked to reassume the obligation imposed upon him by Article VI of the treat} of 1910, he might infer that they would not oppose any interference by him with the integrity of the Rulers in question and would thus be encouraged to extend his f i influence in South-East Arabia. ... If, however, Ibn Saud should finally prove unwillmg to agree to reassume the obligation in the new treaty, you should inform him that H.M^Government hold themselves free to take what action they consider necessary in particular cases.' 212. Ibn Saud raised no objection to the draft Article, subject to the ®^® onto substitution of the words ' maintain friendly relations with for the words y q ^ 6.6.27, to refrain from all aggression or interference with, and the omission ot the p. 3269/27. words ' or under the protection of the Government of His Britannic Majesty.' Jedda to His grounds were that the earlier wording was not compatible with his dignity ^127 ^ an independent Ruler, and more particularly that the term 'interference' seemed to him to be capable of too wide an interpretation. The terms of the Article as finally agreed were as follows :— ' His Majesty the King of the Hedjaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies undertakes to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories of Koweit and Bahrain, and with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty s Government.' 3076 M P. 494/27. f* 1 :| ii 1 Li■vl j (#1 t iHlt ' 44 Anglo-Turkisk Conventions of 1913—1914 not communicated to Ibn Sand in 1927. 213 It may be recorded in this connection, as a point of some importance, that' Ibn Sand in connection with the discussions which culminated in the Treaty of Jedda, asked for a statement of the treaty engagements of H.M. government with the rulers whose special treaty relations with them lie undertook under Article VI of that treaty to respect. The list of engagements with which he was furnished did not contain the Anglo -Turkish Conventions of 1913-14. Ihn Saud informed that H.M. Government continue to regard the Blue Line oj the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 as binding on him, 1934. 2 L4 It is unnecessary to examine in any detail the events between the Treaty of Jedda and 1934. Towards the end of 1933 the question of the continental boundaries of Saudi Arabia was raised in an active form by the application of the Wlo-Persian Oil Company to be allowed to negotiate lor an oil concession in Qatar on behalf of the Iraq Petroleum Company, and by uncertainties as to the Eastern boundary which had been set by Ibn Sand to the oil concession he had oranted in respect of Hasa. In connection with this, the sheikh oi Qatar and the United States Government were officially informed in the spring of 1934 that H.M. Government regarded the Blue Line of the 1913 Convention (para. 16o (c) above) as the eastern boundary of Nejd, and as a matter of courtesy the Saudi Government were informed that, enquiry as to the boundary position having been made by the United States Embassy at Angora, a communication m this sense had been made to them. Ibn Saud subsequently intimated that he did not accept the Blue Line as binding upon him, and that he preferred ancestral claims to the territory to the east of it. It is now accepted that the question of his eastern continental boundary is one on which further discussion will be necessary in the near future between him and H.M. Government. VI. —Conclusion. 215. The history of the relations of the Wahabi Amirs with Trucial Oman, Muscat and with the British Government is given in detail above. It may be convenient, in conclusion, briefly to summarise the position and to touch upon certain of the more important general questions bearing on the difficulties wnicn have arisen in connection with the Blue Line and the claims made m a connection by Ibn Saud. i—General Historical Survey. 216 It will be seen that the Wahabi sect originated in Nejd in the earlv part of the eighteenth century; that by the end of the eighteenth century it naa conquered Nejd and Hasa; and that between 1800 and 1818 it established a commanding influence in the hinterland of Trucial Oman, the headquarters its agent being in forts built by the Wahabis at the oasis of Baraimi—a strategics point of the first importance on the borders of T racial Oman and the Muse Sultanate The Wahabi influence came to an end, and Baraimi was lost, wuu the defeat of the Wahabis of Nejd and Hasa by the Egyptians and the capture and execution of the Wahabi Amir in 1818. 217 On the revival of Wahabi power in 1824 overtures were again made In the Wahabis to the Trucial authorities. By 1831 those overtures had produce a considerable effect. By 1^33 Baraimi had been reoccupied. influence appears to have been as powerful in Trucial Oman and its hmter c as it had been in the period prior to the defeat of the Wahabis by the Lgyp * , The Wahabi agent at Baraimi appears to have been maintained there unti was driven out by the local tribes about 1838. Between 1837 and 1'3. . Egyptians again' overcame and destroyed the Wahabi power. . The &gt; r ' re endeavours, with the assistance of a former Wahabi agent at Baraimi to se the allegiance of the Trucial Sheikhs. These, and the Beni Nairn cmei^. Baraimi who now held the oasis, which they had recaptured from the ^ a , ^ m 1837-38, were encouraged to resist by H.M. Government, and the eitorts oi Egyptians ended in failure.45 218. On the withdrawal of the Egyptians in 1840, and a fresh revival of Wahabi power, endeavours were again made in 1842-3 by the Wahabi Amirs to re -establish themselves in Trucial Oman. Baraimi was surrendered by the Naim in 1845 and between that year and 1853 Wahabi influence was to a large extent re -established. 211). Between 1853 and 1869 the Wahabis continued to maintain an Agent at Baraimi. His influence was, however, much less than before, and there are fewer signs of Wahabi influence in the affairs of the Trucial Sheikhdoms or their hinterland. In 1855 the Wahabi Amir, who appears to have paid a tribute to Turkey since 1840, claimed to be a Turkish subject (paragraph 105 above) and in 1866 he appealed unsuccessfully to Turkey for help against Her Majesty's Government (paragraph 92 above). In 1869 the Wahabi Agent at Baraimi was murdered at Shargah, and in the same year the Sultan of Muscat captured Baraimi, in alliance with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. Meanwhile, the Wahabi ruling family, which had since 1865 been internally divided by disputes regarding the succession, were expelled from Hasa by the Turks. They were unable to take steps to re-establish themselves in Trucial Oman, and by 1879 their influence was reduced to Riyadh. Baraimi came under the influence of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and so remained for the next 50 years. 220. From 1875 to 1901 the Saudi family are of merely local political importance. Cut off from the coast and confined to the centre of Arabia their influence is of the smallest and does not extend to Trucial Oman or its hinterland. The principal power in Nejd at this period is the Amir Ibn Rashid of the Jebel Shammar, a Turkish vassal. 221. The Saudis, under the present Saudi King, in 1901 attacked Ibn Rashid. The history of Central Arabia for the next 15 years is that of the struggles for supremacy between the Rashidi and Saudi families, culminating in the victory of the latter in 1922. Between 1901 and 1914 repeated overtures were made by Ibn Saud to H.M. Government with a view to securing their protection against the Turks. These were invariably declined. In May 1914 he reached an under standing with Turkey under which, as a Turkish subject and a Turkish vassal, he was appointed Wali and Commandant of Nejd. 222. On the outbreak of the war Ibn Saud was approached both by the Turks and by H.M. Government. He alleged his preoccupations with Ibn Rashid as an excuse for not co-operating actively with the Turks but did not repudiate his allegiance to them. In 1915 he concluded a treaty with H.M. Government under which he undertook to respect their special relations with the Sheikhs of Bahrein, Koweit, Qatar, and the Trucial Coast, whose boundaries should thereafter be delimited, and thereafter he co-operated with them. The treaty of 1915 regulated relations between H.M. Government and Ibn Saud until 1927. 223. Throughout this time there were no signs of any importance of Wahabi advances in Trucial Oman or its hinterland. In 1925^26 emissaries from the Wahabi Viceroy of Hasa were reported to have been moving in the hinterland, to have approached the Trucial Sheikhs, to have reached Baraimi and to have collected zakat from the tribes (paragraphs 201 to 207 above). The matter was Qot regarded as of great moment and no special steps were taken to deal with the affairs of the hinterland being at that stage of no concern to H.M. Government. But when the Treaty of Jedda of 1927 replaced the Treaty of 1 (\t f* • • • iy io, steps were taken to include in it a provision that Ibn Saud would respect the territories of the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast which were in special treaty relations with H.M. Government. 224. Information accumulating since 1927 goes to suggest that Ibn Saud, as the result of the general prestige which he has achieved, and his authority with Bedouin of Central Arabia, is becoming increasingly a power in the Trucial hnterland and even as far east as Baraimi. H.M. Government have adopted the attitude, both in the Persian Gulf and in dealing with the King, that the eastern boundary of Nejd is the eastern boundary represented by the Blue ^ ln e of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913, and that they cannot acknowledge ^ Saudi authority to the east of that line. This contention is vigorously con ned by Ibn Saud, partly on the basis of what he describes as '' his ancestral claims.' i - H tt f iIv Uji- iil|; 40 II.—P oints of S pecial I nterest. 225. The following are certain of the main points of interest in this connection :— (A) Policy of H.M. Government 1800-1934. (B) Extent to which H.M. Government are committed by Treaty engagements with the Wahabis : 1800-1934. (C) Status of the Trucial Sheikhs and their relation to the Wahabis : 1800 to 1934. (D) Extent of Wahabi control in the area to the east of Nejd : 1800 to 1934. (E) History and position of Baraimi: 1800 to 1934. (F) Extent to which Ibn Saud and the Wahabi Amirs in the pre-War period were Turkish subjects or vassals. (G) The legal position. (A) Policy of H.M. Government, 1800-1934. 226. It will be seen that from 1800 to 1920 the policy of H.M. Government on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf was consistently to avoid any interference in the affairs of the hinterland. In the early part of this period they were solely concerned to make the seas safe for commerce; to put down piracy; and at a slightly later stage to suppress the slave trade. As time went on and the strategic importance of the Gulf area, particularly from the Indian stand point, became greater, they consolidated their relations with the rulers of Bahrein, Koweit, Qatar, and Muscat, and with the Trucial Sheikhs. 227. Their relations with the Wahabi Amirs in the period 1800 to 1870 were on all fours with their relations with the other rulers of this area. Once the Wahabi Amirs established themselves on the sea coast they became a matter of concern to H.M. Government, who were, however, content to abstain from all interference with their activities in the hinterland save to the extent that these might react on the position of the other maritime rulers of the Trucial area and so lead to piratical outbreaks, the revival of slavery, or the absorption of Muscat or Bahrein. They had no treaty relations with the Wahabi Amirs, and their com munications with them (apart from formal representations or demands for reparation for injuries committed at their instigation or by their subjects or vassals) were confined to polite exchanges of letters. The one formal engagement given in the period 1800 to 1870 is a unilateral undertaking given on behalf of the Wahabi Amir in 1866 (paragraph 118 above). 228. From 1870 to 1901 H.M. Government pursued their policy of con solidating their position on the littoral. In the period 1901 to 1913 they repeatedly refused to involve themselves in liabilities towards Ibn Saud. In 1913 they reached an agreement with Turkey in which the eastern boundaries of Turkish influence in Arabia were delimited. Their endeavours at the outbreak of the Great War to secure the co-operation of Ibn Saud against the Turks were successful, and in 1915 they concluded a treaty with him as an independent ruler, under which he undertook to respect the territories of their Arab allies. 229. Supplementary agreements were concluded with Ibn Saud after the war to regulate the boundaries of Koweit and Iraq, and the treaty of 1915 was replaced in 1927 by one less favourable to H.M. Government. Since 1925 the growing power of Ibn Saud and the reassertion of Persian influence by sea, the development of air communications, the transfer of the air route to India and the Last to the Arab littoral of the Gulf, the discovery of oil on that littoral, and the fact that international oil agreements make it difficult to exclude foreign exploitation, have combined to make it necessary to take a more active interest in the affairs of the Trucial Coast, and more difficult to ignore the position in its hinterland; in the case of Qatar it has been necessary in the interests of securing that any oil concession granted shall be under British influence to offer the Sheikh guarantees of protection by land; and the importance of setting a limit to Wahabi expansion in the hinterland has been held to justify the positive challenge to the position of Ibn Saud represented by the intimation to him that the Blue^ Line of the 1913 Convention is his Eastern boundary. i47 (B) Engagements of H.M. Government with the Wahabis between 1800 and 1930. 230 The Treaty of 1915 was the first formal engagement concluded by H.M. Government with the Wahabis. In 1810 friendly letters were exchanged between the Wahabi Amir and the Government of Bombay (paragraph 26 above). In 1813 similar letters were exchanged, and again in 1814 (paragraphs *28-30). In 1820' (paragraph 32) reference was made to the existence of an earlier Anglo- Wahabi Treaty. In 1831 the Wahabis (paragraph 53) expressed a desire for the renewal of 'the treaty .... which was made between you, the British and Imam Saud.' No such treaty could be traced, but a friendly letter was sent in reply to the Wahabis (paragraph 54). In 1843 the Wahabi Amir (paragraph 98) expressed a desire for the renewal of the amicable relations which had existed between his father and the British Government, and a suitable reply was sent. In 1855 (paragraph 105) on the Amir being warned that the British Government regarded the Arab tribes on the coast as independent powers, the Amir referred tc^an understanding 'between us and the British Government of 100 years duration for the security of traders and travellers passing on the seas.' ^o reference was made in reply to the contention that such an understanding existed. In 1850 the Amir (paragraph 106), endeavouring to justify himself ior his attacks on the Sheikh of Bahrein, alleged that 'between the Wahabi Amir and the British Government treaties have been made by the several authorities, authority after authority,' and referred to his treaties with the Turks. The reply sent to him took no notice of this point. 231. In 1865 Colonel Pelly, then Political Resident, visited the Wahabi Amir at Riyadh. It was repeatedly subsequently alleged that some undertaking was then entered into by the Resident with the Wahabi Amir. i here is nothing to support this (paragraphs 110-112). Subsequent to the visit, the Amir (paragraph 115), in reply to a protest against the activities of his Lieutenant at Baraimi, alleged that there existed between the Wahabi power and the British Government an agreement originally effected in the time oi tne late baud and acrain ratified in the time of the then ruler. Xo trace ot any such document or agreement could be found, and on the point being raised with the Wahabi envoys by Colonel Pelly they replied (paragraph 120) ' that the Wahabi Amirs had from time to time received friendly letters from the British authorities, and that ttie Wahabi Government considers a friendly letter to be synonymous with a treaty agreement' (1866). On 21st April 1866 a Wahabi representative volunteered the declaration recorded in paragraph 118 above. Ihis was a unilateial declaration. 232. It will be seen that, if the Wahabi declaration of 1866 is left out of account, there is no foundation for any suggestion that any treaty or agreement, whether affecting the Trucial Sheikhdoms or the hinterland, was concluded between the Wahabis and H.M. Government between 1800 and 1870. Nor was any engagement subsequently entered into until the formal treaty of 1915 between H.M. Government and Ibn Saud, now superseded by the later Tieaty ot Jedda of * 1927 No Saudi argument in regard to the Blue Line or the territorial limits of Saudi Arabia can thus be based on any engagement concluded prior to 1915 by H.M. Government. It is, on the other hand, a legitimate argument on the Saudi side, and one which they have not neglected, that no reference was made to the Blue Line in the lengthy discussions which preceded the conclusion of the Treaties of 1915 or 1927, and that the Anglo-Turkish Conventions were not communicated to them on the occasion of the latter treaty; though it is no doubt open to H.M. Government to argue, on the other side, that while as the result of their breach with Turkey they were prepared to ignore the Blue Line, and, as proposed on the initiative of H.M. Government, to agree to a subsequent territorial delimitation, the Blue Line, which was internationally legally binding, must be the stalling point of any discussions designed to bring about a modification. (C) Status of the Trucial Sheikhs, and their relation to the Wahabis: 1800 to 1934. 233. H.M. Government, without consultation with or any protest by the Wahabi Amir, in 1806 entered into an agreement with the Jowasimi Sheikh of Ras-al Khaimah-Shargah for the suppression of piracy (paragraph 24 above). In 3076 N1820 (paragraph 34) they entered into a general maritime treaty with the predecessors of the present Trucial Sheikhs. They have maintained those treaty relations since that date and have supplemented them by engagements, either with individual rulers, or with the Trucial Sheikhs generally, regarding slavery and piracy in 1838 (Ajman, Debai, Abu Dhabi, Shargah); 1839 (Ras al KhaimahV 1843 (all Trucial Sheikhs); 1847 (all Trucial Sheikhs); 1853 (all Trucial Sheikhs) 1864 (Shargah, Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Debai, Umm al Qaiwain); 1868 (Abu Dhabi and Qatar); 1873 (Shargah, Abu Dhabi). In 1887 they secured 'exclusive agreements ' from the Trucial Sheikhs, which were confirmed and strengthened in 1892, since when control of the foreign relations of these sheikhdoms has rested with H.M. Government. Further undertakings were obtained from the Trucial area in 1902; 1911-12 (pearling and sponge-fishing concessions); 1912 (Shargah- Tamb light-house); 1922 (oil). The treaty of 1820 and all subsequent treaties were entered into with the Trucial Sheikhs as independent States, and H.M. Govern ment, in so far as they have found it necessary to apply forcible pressure to the Sheikhs to ensure their compliance with the engagements accepted under those treaties, have done so without reference to, protest by (save in 1833—paragraph 46 above), or the prior sanction of, any other power. 234. Since 1823 H.M. Government have (paragraph 36) been locally repre sented by a native Agent, with headquarters at Shargah, of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Since 1932 the Trucial Coast has informallv been placed under the supervision of the British Political Agent at Bahrein. The history of the period since 1800, as recorded above, illustrates the close contact consistently maintained with the Trucial Coast by the Resident, which inevitably arose from the obligations assumed by the Sheikhs and by H.M. Government under the Maritime Truce of 1820 (paragraph 34), and the subsequent engagements by which it was supplemented. 235. The historical survey above goes to suggest that between 1800 and 1870 the Trucial Sheikhs (but Abu Dhabi to a much less extent than the Jowasimis of Shargah), were for considerable periods under a large, though not consistently an effective, degree of Wahabi influence, if not control. But the important division in the area seems to have been that between the religious factions of the Hinawis (represented by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and the Sultan of Muscat) and the Ghafaris (represented by the Jowasimi Sheikh); the minor Sheikhs of Ajman and Umm al Qaiwain, who normally co-operated with Shargah-Ras al Khaimah, and of Dibai, who normally co-operated with Abu Dhabi, changing sides according as one or other of the two major Sheikhs seemed likely to assume a dominating influence. Wahabi influence declined in this area after 1853 and disappeared altogether, save as a purely religious movement, after 1870. It appears to have revived only in the period subsequent to 1920. The long breaks in the continuity of Wahabi influence in Trucial Oman apart, it can fairly be maintained that the Trucial Sheikhs have throughout, in continental as well as in maritime affairs, been independent political entities, even if some of them were negligible in size, and if most, if not all, were by land responsive to or entirely under the influence at various times of the strongest neighbouring power, whether that power was Muscat or the Wahabi Amirs. It seems difficult in any event for Ibn Saud to base any substantial claim to suzerainty over these sheikhdoms or their immediate hinterland at this stage, merely on the broken record of Wahabi influence in Trucial Oman during the period between 1800 and 1870, or on its revival in the period subsequent to 1920, at a date when he had by formal treaty engagements undertaken to respect the independence of these States. (D) Extent of Wahahi control in the area to the east of Nejd from 1800 to 1934. 236. From the historical statement above it will be seen that this has varied very greatly, both in degree and in area, and that there are considerable gaps in its continuity. From 1800 to about 1815 it appears to have been a fairly substantial control, less marked in the case of Abu Dhabi, extending as far east as the boundaries of Muscat and largely exercised from Baraimi. The same is true of the period 1831-33 until 1836, or possibly as late as 1838. From 1845 to 1853 Wahabi influence is again marked over the same area as before. From 1853 to 1869 it underwent a steady decline, and from 1869 until 1923 it i s practically non-existent, though the Sheikhs react quickly to the fortunes of the49 ruler of Nejd {cv. paragraphs 138-9, 152, &amp;c.). At that point there are definite signs of revival, though, even so, the Trucial Sheikhs are divided among themselves, Abu Dhabi and Debai being opposed, like Muscat, to any such revival; Rasal Khaimah and Shargah inclined to sympathise; and the remainder neutral. In the hinterland of the Trucial Sheikhs Wahabi influence appears to extend in an informal fashion as far east as the oasis of Baraimi, a minority of the tribes occupying it having paid zakat \ while Mr. Bertram Thomas and other travellers report that the A1 Murra tribe of the Central Arabian Desert also defer to it. 237. The main test of the existence of this influence is the payment of zakat by tribes or rulers. No payments are now made by the Trucial Sheikhs, who, how ever, exchange presents with the Amir of Hasa. The local political authorities positively state that this payment is, in fact, a form of danegeld or blackmail, and does not connote any political subjection. ' The position seems to be that the Trucial Chiefs and the tribes fear p.z.4860/34. aggression from Ibn Saud and try to placate him, the former by presents of courtesy, and by listening to representations, for example, in cases affecting his nationals, and the latter by paying zakat to him. But these arrangements are of recent standing, and merely indicate that for the moment Ibn Saud is sufficiently powerful to make the payment of blackmail to him an appropriate insurance. (E) History and position of Baraimi. 238. Baraimi was in the past the only important Wahabi settlement in the Trucial area. The oasis of which it is the centre is well watered, fertile and strategically of great importance, since it commands the approaches into the Sultanate of Muscat. It was captured by the Wahabis in 1800, and from that date to 1869 was the headquarters of their representative in Eastern Arabia, with intervals during which it passed out of Wahabi control from 1818, or slightly earlier, to about 1833; from 1838 to 1845; and in 1848—9. In 1869 it was captured by the Sultan of Muscat, and appears never since to have been reoccupied by the Wahabis. Its forts are at present held by the Beni Naim, who appear to be hostile to the Wahabis, though a minority of the tribes who occupy the oasis were reported in 1924 to have paid zakat to the Wahabi tax collectors. It will be seen that there is thus no history of continuous Wahabi occupation, and that the oasis has not been under effective Wahabi control since 1869. (F) Extent to which the Wahabi Amirs and Ibn Saud have in the past professed allegiance to Turkey. 239. The Wahabi Amirs were decisively defeated in 1818 by the Egyptians, and the Wahabi Amir himself executed at Constantinople. On the revival of the Wahabi power in 1824 and for some years afterwards, the then Amir Turki appears to have paid tribute to the Viceroy of Egypt, and to have endeavoured to represent himself to the Viceroy (though not locally in Arabia) as the Viceroy's agent (paragraph 37). They were again decisively defeated by the Egyptians in 1837-39, and the Wahabi Amir taken prisoner to Cairo. He was released by the Egyptians and returned to Nejd in 1842. From 1839 to his death in 1865, it would appear (paragraph 90) that the Wahabi Amir paid tribute to Turkey, though, at any rate in the latter part of this period, through the Turkish authorities at Mecca. 240. In 1855 the Wahabi Amir professed (paragraph 91), in writing, to a Turkish dependant, and stated that he had made it clear to Mehemet Ali, when the latter approached him in 1837 with a view to securing his co-operation a gainst the tribes of eastern Arabia, that he could do nothing without the approval of the Sultan. In 1859 the Wahabi Amir, again in writing, referred to treaties concluded in the past between him and the Sultan of Turkey. In 1866 the Wahabi Amir (paragraph 92) made overtures, apparently almost simultaneously, ^ Great Britain and the Turks. But the overtures of his envoy were ultimatelv ejected by the Turkish Wali of Baghdad.50 (cp. paras. 145, 152, 164.) F.O. to I.O., 31.8.34. 241 In 1871 the Turks were called in by the Amir Sand, who subsequently became the head of the Wahabis. The negotiations between the Saudis and the Turks in the 10 years which followed appear consistently to have proceeded on the basis that the Wahabi Amirs, in return for Turkish support to enable them to re-establish themselves in Nejd and possibly Hasa, were prepared to accept Turkish suzerainty. In 1890 they professed their obedience to the Turkish authorities (paragraphs 125, 127, 128). Ibn Rashid, by whom they were finally defeated in 1888, and who, from 1876 to 1901, was the leading ruler in Central Arabia, consistently professed allegiance to Turkey. Between 1901 and 1913, Ibn Saud, while continually endeavouring to secure British protection and British assistance against the Turks, on various occasions appears to have submitted to Turkish authority (see in particular paragraphs 136, 137, 150, 151), to have drawn allowances from them for his father or himself (paragraph 141, but see paragraph 152), and to have settled tribal disputes on behalf of Turkey (paragraph 150). In May 1914, abandoning hope of the active assistance of H.M. Government, he concluded a treaty as ' Wali and Commandant of Nejd ' with the Wali of Basra, 'who was specially empowered by imperial iradeh,' the text of which will be found in Appendix A, and which is only consistent with Ibn Sand's full acceptance of the status of a Turkish subject and official. It may be noted, too, that on the outbreak of the War, Ibn Saud did not repudiate allegiance to Turkey, but gave as an excuse for his failure to lend armed assistance to the Turks that he was engaged in hostilities with Ibn Rashid, while at the beginning of 1915 he hinted to H.M. Government that, failing a satisfactory written understanding with them, it would be necessary for him to make overtures to the Turks. 242. The true position is no doubt that, throughout the whole of this period, the Wahabi Amirs, solely concerned with their own interests, were prepared to give a formal acknowledgment of Turkish suzerainty or to pay a nominal tribute to Turkey if by doing so they could be assured of non-interference by Turkey in their concerns. From one standpoint it would be unreasonable therefore to attach undue importance to the acknowledgments of suzerainty constituted by the series of incidents referred to above. But it is on the other hand open to H.M. Govern ment in any dispute in which they may be concerned with Ibn Saud in which that ruler claims that he and his ancestors have for the last century been the indepen dent rulers of Nejd and Hasa, and that he is not the successor in title of the Turks in those areas, to take advantage of the very frequent and consistent reiterations of Wahabi allegiance to Turkey over almost the whole of the period. (G) The legal ^position. 243. On the limited issue of the continued validity of the provisions affecting the Blue Line of the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 (paragraph 165) and 1914 (paragraph 179 above), the Foreign Office, at an earlier stage, expressed the view that the Blue Line remained internationally legally binding as against Ibn Saud. On the wider question of what precisely H.M. Government are legally entitled to maintain as against the King in regard to the Blue Line, they have since expressed the interesting and important opinions : — (а) That there is reason to believe that the territory immediately east of the Blue Line, on the assumption that neither H.M. Government nor any Arab State under their protection exercises any authority there, is at present either res nullius or (conceivably) in parts already under the sovereignty of Ibn Saud. (б) That &lt;£ while we are perfectly justified to use the Blue Line and the position of Ibn Saud as the successor of Turkey, &amp;c., as much as we can in negotiating with Ibn Saud in order to secure the most accept able frontier possible in wording future agreements, I do not think we should win before a tribunal deciding the matter on legal principle 8 if the issue was whether the area immediately east of the Blue Line was a part of the territory of the Sheikh of Qatar, a British protected principality, or, if it was res nullius, whether Ibn Saud was free to acquire territory by occupation or prescription if he could produce evidence of the state of affairs necessary to support such a claim.'

Trucial Oman, being the area at present occupied by the Trucial Sheikh doms (excluding Qatar), runs in the Persian Gulf from the Khor al Odeid in the West to Sha'am in the East and in the Gulf of Oman from Khor Kalba to Dibah, the places named all being included in it. Inland on one side, it is bounded by a line of uncertain course which runs from a spot between the contiguous villages of Dibah and Bai'ah on the East coast to Ras Shaam on the West coast, and so divides it from the Ruus-al-Jibal district of the Oman Sultanate to the North; on another by a line even more indeterminate, which leaves the Gulf between Khor Kalba and Murair and after partially crossing the promontory in such a way as to exclude the Madadhah and Jau districts to the South, is eventually lost in South Khatam; West of Khatam the inland limit of Trucial Oman is at the commencement of the Ruba al Khali and the Jafarah deserts. 2. The existing Trucial Sheikhdoms are Abu Dhabi, Debai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al Qaiwain, and Ras al Khaimah. The rulers of those principalities in 1820 signed the Trucial Treaty with His Majesty's Government. 3. The boundaries (omitting mention of insular possessions),of the Trucial Sheikhdoms as laid down in Lorimer's Gazetteer (1905) are as follows :— A hu Dhabi. 4. From Khor al Ghanadhah on the East to the Khor-al-Odeid (the northern shore of which inlet should in Lorimer's view, perhaps be reckoned as included with the inlet itself in his territories) on the West—a distance of over 200 miles. ' Inland the frontiers of Abu Dhabi are not defined : it is asserted that on the East they reach to the Baraimi oasis, but without taking it in; and on the South they may presumably be placed at the margin of the Ruba' al Khali.' A regular tribute was paid to Abu Dhabi by the Dhawahir, ' who are numerically a majority in Baraimi, though Baraimi was itself independent (see paragraph 12 below). Lor. II, 454. Debai. Lor.

On the East it is bounded by the Gulf of Oman, and on the West by the Persian Gulf.' 7. Its boundary with Ajman is at a place called Dabdabah, 2^ miles from the North end of the date groves of Sharjah Town; and with Debai at Abu Hail. Ij01 . n 8. Inland, Sharjah proper 'does not, it is stated, extend beyond Wasit, a 1757-8! locality 5 miles East of Sharjah Town, the tract between this and Dhaid not being under the Sheikh's control.' The detached oasis of Dhaid is administered through a Wali.53 Lor. II, 1004-5. Lor. II, 1007. a ' Xhe authority of the Sheikh only extends 2 miles inland, and, upon .i. sea U miles South-West and 2| miles North-East, embracing on the ,t mentioned side part of the tract called Zora : his dominions are thus an mdave in Shariah territory. There is no dependent village, and no Bedouin tribe Lor.II,53-4. nwes allegiance to the Sheikh, who is of the Qaratisah section of the Na 1111 . a political alliance and friendly relations, however, generally subsist between the inhabitants of Ajman and the people of Baraimi.' Umm-al-Qaiwain. . 10. The Sheikhdom 'has no clearly defined boundaries, but it lorms an enclave in Sharjah territory. On the coast it reaches North-East to Jazirat-al- Hamra and South-West part of the way to Hamriyah : the Siniyah island formed Lor. n, bv Khor -al-Baidhah is thus included in it.' Falaj A1 Ali (or Falai), about 16 &lt; &gt;• miles South-East of Umm-al-Qaiwain town and perhaps 8 miles North-West ot Dhaid village, is the only place of importance not on the coast which belongs to Umm-al-Qaiwain. Ras-al-Khaimah. , ^ -r^ i t ^ i • 11 At the date of compilation of Lonmer s Gazetteer Ras-al-Khaimah was under the control of Sharjah and constituted the Northernmost district in that principality. It has since again become an independent State. It is described by Lorimer as ' divided !rom the Ruus-al-Jibal district of the Oman Sultanate on the North-East by a line which runs obliquely from Ras-ash- Sha'am on the West coast of the promontory to a point between the village of Dibah proper and Bai ah on the hast coast. On the West, from Ras-ash-Sha am on the North to the South end of Jazirat-al-Hamra on the South, it is bounded by the sea; and thence by a line, of which the course is indefinite, drawn across the desert to the Southern extremity of the Jiri Plain. 1 he South-hast limit is an imaginary line connecting the South end of Jiri with the East coast at a point immediately south of Dibah.' The town of Dibah and village ot Wamm were at the date of Lorimer's Gazetteer exempt from the jurisdiction of the Deputy Governor (on behalf of Sharjah) and held in fief by a Wali who was first cousin of the Sheikh of Sharjah. Independent Oman. 12. This consisted in 1905 of a small tract lying between the Oman Sultanate Lor.II,1368 and Trucial Oman, consisting chiefly of the districts of Jau and Mahadhah ' which is not subject to any recognised ruler and may therefore be styled Independent Oman.' It includes the important oasis of Baraimi. 13. The boundaries of Jau are indefinite, but the tract embraces Jabul Hafit, Lor. II, with the villages uear the southern end of that range. It includes, at its north- 931-3, western and most important part, the oasis of Baraimi, which lies a little south of 260-5. a straight line drawn between the towns of Sohar and Abu Dhabi, about 65 miles west by south of the former and 85 miles east by south of the latter. The oasis is nearly circular and its diameter is about 6 miles. Its political position in 1905 was as follows : ' Raraimi is independent, but the influence of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in the district is strong and increasing. The ruins of the fort at Muraijib bear witness to the hereditary connection of his family with Baraimi, and he has recently acquired and is now engaged in developing an estate at Jahali, while Masudi is being formed into a village by his eldest son. Moreover, a regular tribute ... is paid him by the Dhawahir, who are numerically a majority in the oasis. At the present time the Sheikh could probably seize Baraimi if he wished to do so, hut his policy appears to be one of pacific penetration. The Nairn are the original owners of the oasis and possession of the fort in Baraimi village still gives them prestige and a local superiority over the Dhawahir. A few Manasir of the Abu Khail section frequent the Baraimi oasis or its neighbourhood in summer.' U. Mahadhah is described as a plain in the heart of the Oman promontory, the Ltm n, headquarters of the Beni Khab tribe, which, together with Jau, forms the greater 111/ - 21 - part of Independent Oman. Mahadhah is probably situated 15-20 miles north-east of the Baraimi oasis, but its exact position is uncertain. Its level is said to be somewhat higher than that of Baraimi and its extent is described as about 6 miles in any direction. 3076 P54 APPENDIX C. Map showing the extent of Wahabi and of Muscat Power, 1865 (enclosure in Bushire Despatch to Bombay No. 11 of 14th February 1865). APPENDIX D. The Manasir and the A1 Murra. The Manasir. Lor. II. Lorimer (1005) describes the Manasir as 44 a bedouin tribe of Trucial Oman 1162-4. whose headquarters are in Dliafrah. Their general range is from Qatar on the north-east to the Baraimi oasis on the east, and they are found all over Dhafrah, but especially in Dhafrah proper and Lira ah and also in Khatam. A few frequent the neighbourhood of Abu Dhabi town and visit the Baraimi oasis and some are settled in the coast villages of Khan and Jumairah. On the north the tribe are in contact with the Beni Hajir in the neighbourhood of Qatar, and further inland on the west with the A1 Murra; their raiding parties sometimes reach Wadi Faruq. On the east their territory marches with that of the Beni Yas, with whom, moreover, they are intermingled in Dhafrah, and to the south of them the country is uninhabited, being part of the Rub' al Khali. The Manasir, except those at Khan and Jumairah, are altogether nomadic. Most of them winter in Qatar or its neighbourhood and spend the suramer in Liwah, where they have temporary villages of huts and some date groves possessed as tribal joint property. . . . The total number of the tribe is about 1,400 souls. . . . The Manasir were formerly subject to the Wahabi Government, and in 1865 were understood to pay a contri bution worth 2,000 dollars a year, chiefly in kind, into the Wahabi treasury. Now they are independent of all control, but maintain some degree of intercourse with the town of Abu Dhabi and its Sheikh/' Vol. I, p. 89. The Admiralty Handbook of Arabia (May 1916) describes the Manasir as 'a small independent tribe in the ill-known Dhafrah district, bordering on the domain of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, to whom, if to anyone, they owe a vague allegiance, having for a generation or so been free of tribute to Ibn Saud. They are the last predominantly nomadic tribe towards the south, the Great Desert and. the Jafurah Desert enclosing their dira south and west, and the mainly settled and friendly Beni Yas of the Trucial Coast lying east. North lies the dira of the Al Murra, with whom the Manasir seem to be on better terms than anyone else. In winter the whole tribe moves into or near El Qatar. In summer part of it may be found as far south as the Barairni oasis in north-west Oraan. Mainly pastoral, the Manasir possess arable land and suramer settlements in Dhafrah (Liwah district) and are much in advance of the Al Murra in civilisation. Both in religious tenets and political connections they pertain to Oman. There seems to be no paramount Mansuri chief. The tribe numbers about 1,500 souls.' The Al Murua. The Al Murra are described by Lorimer (1905) as 'a considerable Arab tribe of Eastern Arabia, very notorious for their misdeeds, but otherwise less is known of them than of any other tribe of equal size and importance in the same region u Arabia. The Al Murra inhabit the country in the south of the Hasa Sanjak anc that adjoining it, but lying beyond its border on the same side. Some are generall} to be found in Kharma, near the wells of Zarnuqah. They visit Barr adh Dhahran and their raiders sometimes invest Wadi Faruq. They are the only inhabitants of the Jafurah Desert. Jabrin is their property. They sometimes visit Qatar in their peregrinations and they frequent the district of Aqal to a certain extent. A ^ Al Murra are among the bedouins who resort annually to Anik in the Qatif oasis and who are regarded as having a permanent connection with the place • • * Lorimer estimates the total number of the tribe at approximately 7»000 and the total fighting strength at 2,000. He adds that ' the Al Murra, when pressed b}' enemies more powerful than themselves ordinarily take refuge in the impenetrable Lor. II, 1239-42.Jafurah Desert. But in 1902 the Turks, alter the Oqair outrage [when the A1 Murra cut up a Turkish force near Oqair Port], succeeded in surprising a large body of them at the wells of Zarnuqah in Kharma and inflicted on them a sanguinary defeat. The Amirs of the Wahabis sent frequent expeditions against the A1 Murra, but one only, led by the Amir Feisal, was partially successful. His force, however, reached the scene of action in such a feeble state owing to want of water, that he was obliged to be satisfied with a nominal arrangement, and returned to Nejd vanquished rather than victorious. In connection with the postal service in the Hasa Sanjak the Turks pay small subsidies to the chief Sheikh of the A1 Murra. But these do not avail to secure the good behaviour of the tribe, nor can any revenue be realised from them by the Ottoman Government. . . . About 1865 the A1 Murra were paying the value of 3,000 dollars as revenue to the Wahabi Amir, and during the recent conflict in Central Arabia they supported the Wahabi cause, but they are not at present tributaries of Ibn Saud. 1 ' The Admiralty Handbook of Arabia (May 1916) describes the A1 Murra as Vol. I, pp. 'a savage and ill-known tribe, wholly nomadic, who range from the south of Hasa 88-89. into the Jafurah Desert and down to the wild oasis of Jabrin. . . . On the north they come up to near Oqair, while inland they lie south of the Hofuf-Riyadh routes, which they harry, as far as the borders of Kharj. In most of this inhospitable tract they wander alone and neither the Turks nor the Ibn Sauds, whose feudatories they nominally are, have ever been able to follow them far enough to subdue them. . . . They are said to number about 7,000 souls and to turn out 2,000 fighting men. . . . The whole tribe . . . maintains perpetual feud with the Ajman and the Beni Khalid.'■all communications to be addrebfled to the company S/. to ■PERSIAN OIL COMPANY, LIMITED. r ^ J 0^* ^ ^ J LONDON and ABADAN. t ^ ol/J •-*-i CA» — ^ •Jci &lt;JilX T elegraphic A ddress: 'ANGLOPERS.'

It is probable that on Ryan's return to Jedda he will enter ou negotiations in an endeavour to secure an agreement by which all major questions between Sa^di Government and His majesty's Government could be settled mutual satisfaction, and friendship between the two Powers reaffirmed. Certain preliminary discussions have taken place with Faud Hamza in London* 3. One desideratum of Ibn Saud to which he attaches utmost importance is to secure modification of attitude hitherto adopted by His Majesty 's Government that Blue Line of Anglo-furkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914 necessarily constitutes Eastern boundary of Sa'udi Arabia. foreign Office are now advised that while these Conventions and Ibn- 2 - Ibn Saud^ position as successor to Turkey give us a bargaining asset of some value, nevertheless territory to east of Blue Line, so far as it cannot be claimed for Trucial Shaikhs or Muscat, is a res nulliu e in whic. Ibn Saua is entitled to acquire rights by occupation or prescription. In any case it is a matter of great political importance not to allow prosCTpects of a general settlement which .;ould be of advantage to His x^ajesty's Government to break down over question of Blue Line* It rias therefore been decided that in Ryans negotiations whole question of iiastern frontier of Sa 1 uai Arabia should be discussed without pre-conditions, pnd that as part of a new general settlement giving His Ivlajesty^s Government their main desiderata in other directions Kis Majesty's Governiuent should be prepared to make concessions in regard to the Eastern limits of Saudi Arabia as generous as is consistent with their own strategic and other requirements in Eastern Arabia and the legitimate claims of Trucial Shaikhs and Sultan of Muscat, 4, Defence Departments of His Majesty's Government v/ill be consulted regarding strategic r equirements• In the meantime, as first step towards consideration of nature andejctent of I concessions which might be offered I should be glad if PolitiCcl Resident in the Persian Gulf cculd let me have as expeditiously as may be, information Qn the following questions :- 3 - (1) what are existing boundaries inter se of each Trucial Shaikhdom and Musaat ? It is desirable to ascertain whether information in Lorimer is up to date, (2) what are regarded as boundaries, if any, of Truc^al Shaikhdoms and Muscat towards hinterland or what is extent of claim of Shaikhs and Sultan in respect of soverignty flj 11 payment of zakat, or control of or influence over tribes in the direction of the hinterland ? In the case of Muscat the landward extent of Sultans control and influence should, if possible, be stated right round to the point where his coast line Joins that of the Hadramaut, (3) what are the views of Political Resident as to degree to which such claims are justifiable and ought to be supported either in our own interests or m le^itixaate interests of Rulers concerned ? 5. Information under (1) above is desirable because it is, of course, clear that whatever concessions in hinterland might be offered it would be i contrary to ourpolitical ana other interests to allow ' Ibn Saud to extend his dominions to coast anywhere east of ^atar and the hadramaut. It is therefore necessary to make sure whether or not there are any unclaimed gaps of territory on coast between boundaries of/(&amp; n ' - 4 - of various States. So far as coast is concerned the only possible concession would ap-ear to be territory between Blue Line and head of iJohat es Salwa. 6. It is possible it may be decided that any concession of Ibn Saud in hinterland should be based on a tribal rather than on a strict geographical basis. This would mean that instead of defining on the map the of a salient of territory stretching eastwards from Blue Line it might be found preferable merely to acknowledge that Ibn baud's authority extended over certain tribes living in hinterland. In collecting information requested above Political Resident should give particular atten tion to hAbitats and allegiances of various tribes both settled and migratory e.g. in the case of each Ruler it should be stated what tribes or sections of tribes are settled in area controlled by Rulers and what migratory tribes or sections visit such areas. It appears that Ibn Saud is particularly in terested in questions of Murra and lianas ir. - SECRETARY OF STATE - FOR LRDIA »82/27 Telegram From T o XX His Majesty's Secretary of 6tate for India, London. uovernment of India, Foreign and Political Department, 6imla,No.2316 Repeated to Political resident, Bushire,]so.23l7 Dated 2nd received 3rd October 1934.

My dear Gilbert, Many thanKs for your letter of the 20th August enclosing copies of corresoondence 'with Ryan about the Blue Line. 2. We have now got Bcckett f 9 views on the lesal points raised by Ryan in paragraphs 13 to 15 of his memorandum of the 30th July, and I am able to send you a copy of Beckett's minute. Beckett had previously advised on the question or the validity of the relevant provisions in the 1913 and 1914 iOiglo-Turkish Conventions, having regard to the fact that only the 1914 Convention was ratified. He had not hitherto given a considered opinion as to what precisely we were legally entitled to contend in regard to the Blue Line, as against Ibn Saud. You will see that Ryan^s qualms, are, in Beckett's view, to some extent, justified. 3. On one point, I had a word with Beckett after 1 had seen his minute, viz. his endorsement, in paragraph 8 of the minute, of Ryan's view that the Treaties of 1916 and 1927 with Ibn Saud 'appear to proceed on the basis that Ibn Baud 's territories and those of the Sheikhs oi ^atar, etc. are coterminous* (which had surprised me). Becket' sai ac he might possibly have oversteted the case on this point; but that in any case if we were not prepared to contend that the territory immediately to the east o the Blue Line ^ell under the sovereignty of the Sheikbs of Qatrr, etc* oui cas6 is much weaker. Prom a legal point of view, he holds, as you will see, that the 'British sphere of influence M cock will not fiyht at all. Yours ever, (Sgd. ) CHRISTOPHJSR WARNER G* Laithwaite, Esq. P.Z. 6052/34. 5348/279/91.I am glad of the opportunity to read all these papers and to consider the question of the blue line in its legal aspects in the light of &amp;^e much fuller information than was before me on any previous occasion. 1. We start from the position that Turkey, by the treaty of 1914, article 3, which adopted article 11 of the treaty of 1913, accepted the blue line as the limits of Turkish sovereignty in this part of the Arabian peninsula. From this it is clear that to the extent that Ibn Saud is the successor of the old Ottoman Empire in this part of the world and must base his claim on such succession, the blue line represents the limits of the territories which he acquired as Turkey's successor# I see that he was disposed 6 0 take the view that, even in 1913-1914 Turkey was not the sovereign in this part of the world, that he vms already then an independent power and that Turkey's treaties were invalid because ^she was dealing with territories ovsr which shs had/ sovereignty# argument is, of course, disposed of by the treaty which Ibn Saud himself concluded with Turkey on the 15th May, 1914, which I see recorded in the memorandum attached to E*4451, 2. The foregoing however only amounts to thiS| as successor of Turkey he could not claim beyond the blue line, and he certainly was the successor o± Turkey# But this is by no means the same thing as saying that Ibn Saud cannot, since that date, have acquired a sovereignty beyond the blue line, oi that/2. that His Majesty's Government possess soyereignty right up to the blue line on the other side, or that any sheikh under their protection does so. 3. The subsequent questions for consideration fall substantially into two classes: (a) the question whether by our subsequent treaty negotiations with Ibn Saud His Majesty's Government have waived or lost any right that they may otherwise have possessed to hold Ibn Saud's territories to be limited by the blue line, and (b) whether, even if an a: firmative answer is not returned to (a), it must be admitted that a substojitial portion of the territory east of the blue line is res nullius and therefore as such (i) open to acquisition by occupation on the part of Ibn Saud, and (ii) not being under the sovereignty of His Majesty's Government or within the territory of any sheikh's under their protection, is sua area where His Majesty's Government have no legal right to object to steps being taken by Ibn Saud in the direction of acquisition of sovereignty by occupation, even if he has not at present done sufficient to acquire a definitive title. 4. It must be remebered that under internati onal law territory is either under the sovereignty of a member of the family of nations, or it is not5 if it is not, then it is open to acquisition by occupation by another power. Spheres of influence in international law, whatever their political significance, mean nothing at all« If a state admits it has not sovereignty over a territory, but only claims a sphere of influence over it/mmmm—m mm 3. it, then apart from treaty obligations binding particular powers not to enter the sphere of influence etc. legally any other power can go there and take steps to make itself sovereign, I am well aware that from the political point of view spneres oi influence may have great importance. It may be a ground upon which representations may be made to another state that its action in going there is provocative and unfriendly, and that it must not be surprised if their action provokes the resentment and retaliation which may follow upon provocative and unfriendly, but nevertheless perfectly legal, acts. Legally a sphere of influence is of no effect at all unless you have a s )ecific treaty with the power who is entering the zone, under which the latter has specifically undertaken not to do so. 5. The second point to be remembered is that under international law, to use the words of Huber as arbitrator: 'Territorial sovereignty cannot be limited to its negative side'. Sovereignty over territory cannot consist in a mere right to keep other states out when the soi disant sovereign exercises no authority whatever there. If this is the position, then even if the soi disant sovereign had originally a perfectly sound title, he will lose it if another state enters the territory and de facto exercises authority there for a sufficient period, and this acquires a prescriptive right. 6. Applying these principles to the case of the territory immediately to the east of the blue line,it seems to be perfectly clear that neither His Majesty 1 s Government nor any Arab state under their protection, exercises any authority there. The Shei.ch of Qatr in whose name we should like to claim the territory has apparently/ ilfl7-/ 4. apparently never attempted to exercise authority up to the blue line, and may be even completely anaware that we are, as it were, attempting to incorporate it into his principality. Turkey, Ibn Saud^ predecessor,did, it is true, impliedly agree in the 1914 treaty that the territory east of the line belonged to the sheikhdom of Qatr, but I do not think that even against Turkey this Treaty would mean that Turkey had undertaken not to cross the line, and acquire sovereignty there by occupation if, in fact, the territory was res nullius , and the Sheikh of Qatr and His Majesty's Government did nothing to establish themselves there. Still less, I think, could it be said that this treaty had this legal effect as regards Ibn Saud as Turkey^ successor. The facts being what they are, I think it is impossible really to establish that the area in fact belonged to the Sheikh of Qatr in 1914, and if this is so, I see no ground upon which His Majesty 1 s Government could have established any title to it at that time. It was res nullius . The position is clearly weaker today because there is certainly some evidence that Ibn Saud has in fact to some extent established his own authority there (see K.1448). I am not attempting to advise now whether the amount of authority Ibn Saud has exercised up to this date is sufficient to give him a title by occupation or prescription, or whether it is only a state of affairs which will produce this result in time, if his present authority there is maintained and increased.7. On these grounds I think that the territory immediptely east of the blue line is at present either res nullius or (conceivably) in parts already under the sovereignty of Ibn Saud. 8. The second part of the case against His Majesty's Government when they seek to maintain that the olue line represents to-day the limits of Ibn Saud f s dominions (as opposed to those which he could claim as successor to Turkey) is based upon the subsequent agreements and negotiations with him in 1915, 192? and 1927. It is true, as Sir A.Ryan states, that the agreements of 1915 and 1927 appear to proceed upon the basis that Ibn Saud^ territories and those of the Sheikh of Q.atr etc. are co-terminous, i.e. that there is no vacuum between them, but this seems to me to be an argument which cuts both ways, though of course it does dispose of any case built up on a British sphere of influence as opposed to territory belonging to the dominions of the Sheikh of f-iatr. But from the legal point of view, the sphere of influence argument was clearly hopeless in any case, and any substantial use of it seems to be merely an admission of weakness on our part and a virtual giving away of any legal case that we may have. It is, of course, an argument against His Majesty's Grovernment that in negotiating the 1915 agreement no mention whatever is made of the blue line. It is not by any means conclusive, because the agreement of 1915 proceeds on the footing that the boundaries of Ibn Saud on one hand and Q.atr on the other are all to be delimited by agreement/'6. agreement. The most that can be said is that the 1915 agreement appears to proceed on the assumption that in the future delimitation by agreement the criterion should be the areas over which Ibn Saud and his predecessors and the Sheikh of q ,atr etc, possessed in the past, end this rather suggests that we did not think the blue line agreement with Turkey was necesssrily to be relevant. This is, of course, not conclusive, because it may well be that Ibn Saud and his predecessors could not really establish claims on ppst history to territory crossing the blue line or even coming anywhere near it, and we would not put the blue line into the agreement because we were not then prepared to admit that he could establish a claim that even vent as far ss this. I doubt very much if the 1927 treaty carries the matter any further. The 1922 agreement relates to an area which is so far distant from the blue line that it can hardly be said to be directly relevant at all. The most that can be said about it is that the frontier with Koweit there agreed upon is quite different from that laid down in the treaty with Turkey or 191.3 and once again the arrangement witn Turkey do not appear to have been taken as the basis for fixing the new frontiers. The argument alone is not, I think, very conclusive, but is, of course, a straw which acquires some force when added to other indications of the same kind. More nearly relevant are the lines drawn by Sir Percy Cox in 1922 at Uquari actually in the areas concerned (B.1512, para.4 of the India/India Office memorsindum)« Sir Percy Cox :rew a line indicating what he considered then to e Ibn baud's li dts, which follows quite a different course from the blue line, and this is perhaps a rather strong indication that the 1915 agreement with Ibn Saud did not mean the blue line to be relied upon when the frontier delimitation contemplated by that agreement was taking place* 9, The conclusion to be drawn crom a ■ this i ^ at, while we are perfectly justified to use -ne blue line and the position of Ibn Saud as a successor of Turkey etc. as much as we can in negotiating with Ibn Saud in order to secure the most acceptable frontier possible it ,cr i .g future agreements, I do not think we should win before a tribunal, deciding the matter on legal principles, if the issue was whether the area immediately east of the blue line was a part of the territory of the Bheikh of Qatr, a British protected principality, or if it was res nullius, whether Ibn Saud was free to acquire territory by occupation or prescriotion, if he could produce evidence of the state of affairs necessary to support such a claim.

M and the neighbouring districts, who at last so swelled the number of Ibn Saoud's adherents, that he became the head of the reformed religion, and according to the Wahhabi pretensions the head of all Islam. Guided by the counsels of Ibn Abd-el-Wahhab, and carried forward on the wave of trie new teaching, he gradually established his authority over all Aared and eventually over the greater part of Nejd. His hardest contests there were with the people of Hiadj who, under their Sheykh, Mohammed ibn Uaus, long held out, and with the Ibn Ghureyr (Areyr or iiruk), Sheykhs of the Beni Khaled. These latter, who owned the districts of Hasa and Katif, though forced to tribute, have always been hostile to the Ibn 3aouds, and are so at the present day.' Kven if a claim based on such grounds could be admitted, it is very doubtful whether this contention (sidelined at of the Ibn Sa^ds can be maintained. After the fall of the Abbaside Caliphate and the Carmathian revolt with its centre round Bahrain and ^atar, about the beginning of the ilth century, Arabia fell into chaos for some two centuries. 'Oman, ^atar and Hasa were organised for a time into a kind of monau % chy under the Nabhan, and later Ya^ibah tribes (both ♦Oman tribes). Najd and iShammar were abandoned to clannish alliances or feuds. The Turkish overlord- ship dated from 1617 when they conquered i^gypt, but from the beginning of the 17th century their claims in Najd, 1 Quan, ; ahrah and the liadramaut were absolutely ignored, and no collision was possible, because no ■ point of contact existed.

A copy has been sent to hy^lail vP,Z # 6496/34 NOTE. Mi', Prasor, Mr, Gass, and I.-Ir, Lefroy of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company called at the India Office on 10th October to discuss the question of the Q.atr oil concession. Mr, Walton, Mr. Laithwaite, Mr. Crombie and Colonel Fov/le were present at the meeting. Mr, Fraser said that, except for the question of the Refining Clause, the terms of the Political Agreement had now been agreed between the Company and His Majesty's Goyernment, With regard to refining, he had been in correspondence with the Admiralty and hoped that a settlement was row in si ^ht and that this would be on the lines of the Refining Clause in the Koweit Political Agreement, The Admiralty were disa pointed that he was unable to go farther than this, cut it was impossible to get the foreign constituents of the I .P .C, to agree to anything more. He explained that the Shell Company had one Dutch and one Biitish Director while similarly the American interests in the I .P .C. had one American and one British Director. Turning to the commercial negotiations 7;ith the Sheikh of Qatr, Mr. Praser said that these would continue to be carried on by Mr, Mylles in whom he had every confidence and who would have a Power of Attorney from the Company to conclude an agreement with the Sheikh, The question to be decided w&amp;s the most suitable time for introducing the Political Agreement into the. negotiations. Should a representative of I!.Ivi,G. approach the Sheikh and clear this question up now or would it be better for the Commercial Agreement to be settled first? Mr, Walton, Mr, Lalthwaite and Colonel Powle all agreed that it would be best that the Commercial Agreement should/f _ 9 _ slioiM 'be settled xirst and Colonel Pov.le suggested that biiis Agreui/.ent snould be signed subject to the approval oi ? II,.,:.G. though he 7?as apprehensive tliat this mirht have an uniavourable reaction on the Sheikh, In r euly to an enquiry from Mr. Fraser, he explained that, as in the case of Koweit, the Sheikh of Oatr was precluded 'by his treaty obligations v, ith H.M.G, from giving a concession v/ithout their approval, Mr, Walton recalled tha. g in bhe Kov/cit concession there had at first been a clause linking the Commercial and the Political Agreements, 'but that this had finally been taken out of the Commercial Agreement and put in an Exchange of Notes. Colonel Povjle suggested that the Sheikh of Qatr might say that he was prepared to sign the Commercial Agreement but that before actually signing he would like to see the terms of the Political Agreement or, alternatively, t-hat he might sign the Commercial Agreement and leave it to the Company's negotiator to explain that the Agreement must be subject to the approval of H.M.G, Mr, Lai thwaite suggested that it would be best, if possible, to get the Sheikh to sign subject to the approval of H.Iv'.G, without mentioning the Political Agreement. It was finally agreed that the most suitable procedure would be that, simultaneously with t.he signature of the Commercial Agreement, there should be an exchange of letters between the Sheikh aid the Company to the effect that the Agreement had been signed 'subject to the Sheikh's treaty obligations to H.F.G,' There would thus be no necessity for any reference to the Political Agreement in the concession and the Sheikh need not know that the terms of the Political Agreement had/had in fact 'been agreed in advance between H.M.G. and the Company. H.M.G. would then produce the Political Agreement for the parties to sign and, subject to this, would give their consent to the concession, the Sheikh simultaneously sending a letter to the Political Agent agreeing that the Commercial Agreement would be subject to the terms of the Political Agreement. The negotiations would thus be concluded by four sets of documents: (a) the Commercial Agreement; (b) an exchange of letters between the Company and the Sheikh; (c) the Political Agreement; and (d) an exchange of letters between the Sheikh and H.M.G. It was agreed that Ivtr. Lefroy should send a letter to the India Office to put it on record that the Company understood and accepted the above programme for the negotiations and enclose for the approval of H.M.G. a drait of the letter which the Company would send to the Sheikh under (b). At the end of the meeting Mr. Lefroy remarked that it had been clear during the Company's previous negotiations with the Sheikh that the latter was maintaining very close contact with the Standard Oil Company in Hasa and that he was also au fait with the situation in regard to the Koweit Oil negotiations. He expressed the opinion that if the Kuwait Oil Company obtained their concession at K'oweit, the position at Qatr might be much more favourable to the Company.r B y Air Mail.

Britannic House, Finsbury Circus, London, E.G.2. 1st November, 1934. J.G. Laithwaite, Esq., India Office, S.W.I. I • fiv Dear Laithwaite, Th^fk you for your letter of the 18th October, (P .Z. 6227/34), about Qatar oil. On that letter and our conversation on the 20th October I have had a redraft made of the last draft dated 13th March, and enclose six copies, dated 25th October 1934, of the redraft of the concession. I have marked on one of these copies the passages or wording different from the last draft dated 13th March 1934, which are as follows: x^reamble. Mylles' name is substituted for ^hisholm's. Article 6. In accordance with the suggestion in paragraph (l) o± your letter, the following words have been added at the end of the 3rd paragraph: Vand in times of national emergency the Shaikh shall have full use, free of charge, of the Company 1 s wireless and telegraph installations and railways for governmental purposes'. . . , . Article 10. In the hope of obviating i ficulties actually experienced elsewhere, v^e have reworded las1: sentence of the first paragraph. In Persia it has even been claimed that such articles as medical supplies and geological expeditionary equipment, for example, are imported : 0r or applicable to the personal use of employees, and are, therefore, dutiable. ' , ^• s you will see, we propose to restrict the dutiable category to articles sold to employees for their personal use - with the exception of food supplies, all imports of which will be liable to duty. Considering the desert nature of the country we still feel this to be a harsh equirement of H.M.G., and we feel it unreasonable to P aoe in the hands of a Shaikh notorious for his cupidity p Power to make the ordinary amenities of life for uropeans unattainable by reason of excessive duties which affect/affect strangers only. We hope that you will reconsider this point and remove your insistence on its offer to the Shaikh. A rticle 14. The third paragraph of the draft of 13th March has been deleted in agreement with you; it is to be covered as in Kuwait by an exchange of letters, Por purposes of construction the article has been divided into two clauses of which (b) covers the pnint in paragraph (2) of your letter of the 18th October. It was felt here that this division of the article into two clauses gave undue stress to the words 'at any time' in the opening phrase of the article. To avoid misinterpretation, and since the occasions on v/hich the Shaikh can terminate the agreement are clearly defined, we have deleted those three words. A rticle 16 .. In consequence of the new reference to default in Article 14 (b) it became necessary to insert a default clause in the arbitration provisions. A paragraph on the lines of the Kuwait draft has been added at the end of the article^ Article 21 of the draft of 12th March . This has been omitted from the present draft, and is to be covered by an exchange of letters. With reference to the suggestion in paragraph (3) of your letter under reply, we would pray you excuse us from adding 'in accordance with your Excellency's Treaty obligations' to the letter which is to be handed to the Shaikh when the Concession is signed. We feel that it is not for us to remind in writing such a Potentate of treaty obligations towards another State, and you promised to reconsider this point. As I told you, Mylles wi11 be instructed to remind verbally the Shaikh of the common knowledge as to his treaty obligations regarding concessions in handing him the letter. We are sending copies of this draft of 25th October to Abadan shortly, with the reservation that our instructions as to negotiations may still be subject to understandings with His Majesty's Government at this end, though you will doubtless have learned that the Kuwait reiinery provisions are now acceptable to the Admiralty for Q-atar.

Dear Lefroy, ^ Many thanks for your letter of 1st November about Qatar Oil and for the redraft of the concession enclosed in it. 2. -Ve have the following comments to make on the redraft. Article 10 . If the Company are prepared to insert an exemption payment, on the same lines as were followed in Koweit, we should be quite ready to accept the modified wording which you now suggest, and to exempt food supplies from duty, but failing this we fear we must hold to the existing draft. V;ill you let me know your vievvs about this? I may point out, as regards the rates of duty, that Article 6 of the Sheikh 1 s Treaty of 1916 provides that 'the customs dues on goods of British merchants imported into Qatar shall not exceed those levied on my own subjects on such goods and shall not in any case exceed 5^ ad valorem . British goods shall be liable to the payment of no other dues or taxation 2»L(ifroy Esq., A.P.O.C. , 1 Britannic House, Finsbury Circus, E.G. of/ I@ im of any amount whatsoever 'beyond those already specified'. This,as you will see, constitutes a substantial protection for the Company against any attempt on the Sheikh's part to raise his duties to an unreasonable figure. It is, havever, from a quite different standpoint also relevant in this connection that there can be little question that the Sheikh will be familiar with the provisions of the Koweit Agreement, and that any marked difference between its terms and those of the concession which he is asked to accept may give rise to difficulty. 3, We agree to the redraft of Article 14 and the omission of the words 'at any time'. 4 # As regards the penultimate paragraph of your letter, in the light of what you say we will not press our suggestion that the words 'in accordance with Your Excellency's Treaty obligations' should be inserted in the letter referred to in paragraph 2 of your letter to me ox 10th October. 5 # Would you be so kind as to let me have another six copies of the Draft if you can spare so many ?

Laithwaite, Esq., India Offioe, S.W.I. Dear Laithwaite, Thank you for your letter of the loth November regarding Qatar oil, under reference P.Z,6792/34, The information you give as to the limitation to bjo ad valorem of the duties which this Shaikh at least may levy on foodstuffs which we might import entirely alters the picture. It is not bjo duties that we are frightened of on food, but the E55^ or more which we have experienced elsewhere. I see little protection from our point of view in any provision that customs dues shall not exceed those levied on Qatar subjects, because our experience elsewhere again has been that our food and other private requirements are not those required by the inhabitants of the countries in which we work, and it is therefore very simple to introauce taxation involving no discrimination in principle but an unbearable burden in practice. If the Shaikh's Treaty of 1916 is to bind him and his successors during the currency of a possible concession, wo should not ask for reconsideration of duties on foodstuffs. I hope that you will not make water similarly dutiable, as I have just heard from Qatar that virtually all the springs there are 'straight Epsom salts'I I agree with your view as to the likelihood of the Shaikh being familiar with the provisions of the Kuwait Agreement. We have every reason to believe that he is closely informed of every step there, and that he has no intention of any serious negotiations pending the completion of the Kuwait negotiations, I am glad that such variations as were effected in the draft dated 25th October are acceptable to you. I enclose another six copies of the draft. Our geological party should by now I think be in Qatar, and Ivlylles will be going there this month to have a look them -nd at the Shaikh, but does not anticipate as I said any serious discussions, since during Ramadan the Shaikh proposes to retire to an inaccessible part of the desert and will be Prepared to hold discussions only during the night season.

Laithwaite , jidia Office, Whitehall, S.W.1» Dear Laithwaite, f Thank you 1'or your letter of yesterday, under reference P.Z. 7118/34, about Qatar oil. I note what you write about the Treaty limitations on the Shaikh's power to levy excessive import duties. As regards Article 10, there seems to be a certain misunderstanding between us. j I*' I read in your letter of the 15th November the S words 'existing draft' to refer to the draft of the 85th October. The draft of the 25th October as I read it appears to give you all the satisfaction you want in requiring a liability on the Company to pay import duties both onfbod supplies and on merchandise, etc. imported by it for sale to its employees. As I pointed out in my letter of the 1st November, we reworded the draft of the 13th March - but without altering in any way its sense - in order to avoid future claims that the Company was liable to duty on goods or materials^ imported purely for Company purposes,for example geological expeditionary equipment, which is issued to geologists from store and taken back into store on their return, against which we have elsewhere experienced claims that such material was dutiable* In our view the goods on which the Company should be exempt are those which are imported as the property ol the Company/Company and remain the property of the Company; goods on which the Company is dutiable are foodstuffs ana goods imported 'by the Company directly for its employees, and in which the Company does not retain property but hands over the goods to the employees against payment. In Persia until the duties became perfectly prohibitive large quantities of goods were so imported for our employees and the normal duties paid. The distinction we make is very definitely as to whether goods are 'on charge' against an employee or the personal property of an employee# ^ As you have not told me in what respect the wording of Article 10 in the draft of 25th October, as explained in my letter of the 1st November, is objectionable, I hop« that this explanation will clear up the question. I cannot read into our redrafted Article 10 any attemx^t at avoiding any of the duties for which you are sugg«sting that the Company should be liable# Yours, &amp;c., (3gd.)L.

The Shaikh has made it plain that he does not want to comiaence negotiations until after Ramadhan, and to confirm his intentions he has left for a tour of his territory and also announced that he will spend the fast at an inconvenient spot in theaesert. Our view is that he is waiting to get a line from Kuwait before he commences business with us. He have already made tne house in habitable, and a geological survey party will have commenced operations. I am now sending Mylles for a short visit to ^atar. He will see the survey party, establish relations with the leading inhabitants and if possicle pay courtesy visits on the Shaikh. Mylles should leave here about the end of next week, most p'-oba^ly by tug, and it occured to me that you might like to see him. If so will you kindly telegraph and I will arrange for the tug to call at Bushire en route.

J»G-• Laithvmite , Esq., India Office, S.W.I. Dear Laithwaite, Thank you for your letter of the 1st December about the ^atar Oil concession, under reference P.Z.7312/34. Letters we ha.ve recently exchanged clear up I think what misunderstanding may have existed between us. I now see your point that in principle the ^ altered wording in Article 10 of our draft of the 25th October is 'much more restrictive', but from the practical point of view from which alone we looked at it it was in our view no more restrictive than the draft of the 13th March 1934 and had the same meaning. Under the March draft we considered that we were liable for Company imports for the personal use of its employees, but the Company in practice imports nothing for the personal use of its employees for which they do not pay. It is simply our experience elsewhere which led to the suggestion from one of our staff recently returned from Persia of a rewording to render impossible claims recently made in that country by the Customs officials. Among several instances I can quote that of coir matting imported solely for placing underneath 10,000 ton tanks, which Customs have argued might be used for the dirty feet of our employees and therefore was dutiable as an article/article importod for their personal use, Since you explained in your letters of the 15th ^ ■ and 36th November the existing and prospective restrictions on that avaricious Shaik's powers of taxing British employees, the position appears quite changed as a practical question. As I have explained to you, since our redraft of the 25th October, what our previous experience has frightened us of is not 5^ duties, but such situations as now exist in P Persia, where for example an oil heating stove brought to Abadan at a c.i.f. cost of 17s.lOd, costs if landed £3.11.9, and an oil cooker with a c.i.f. cost of £7.7.3 costs £25.14.5 landed. If you had ever to do work outside in such a country you would again appreciate the difficulty of producing contentment in the staff with beer at a cost of 2s.6d. or more a bottle'. In view therefore of the prospect of import duties of 5^ or thereabouts we should be ready to take the risk of any misinterpretation of the wording of Article 10 in this respect as it stood in th^j draft of the 13th March last.

Note oi discussion at the India Oi'fice with the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, regarding Persian Gulf oil questions, on Thursday, 10th January 1935. Mr.Walton and I saw Mr.Lefroy of the Anglo-Fersian Oil Company amd Mr.Mylles today. 2. Qatar Oil. The Comoany's representatives said that Mr.Mylles was probably returning to Q-tar by the air mail of the 82nd January to resume negotiations with the Sheikh. Mr.Mylles thought that there was a reasonable chance of agreement with the Sheikh ana did not think there was any risk of the Sheikh negotiating with other parties within the period of the option which he had granted to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company though he had reason to believe that overtures of an unofficial character continued to be made to him by the Hasa Oil Company. The intermedary for such overtures was understood to be Sheikh Nazir, a brother of the Sheikh, resident in Hasa. 3. Mr.Lefroy said that the Company were anxious (a) to secure the concurrence of His Majesty's Government in certain modifications in the drait oi the Qatar oil concession dated 25th October 1934 (copies of which have been circulated to the interested departments), and (b) to reach agreement as to the map to be attached to any concession granted. 4. As regards the first oi these points, the amendments which they desired were the lollowing.- (i) Preamble, line 7. For 'lawful heirs' substitute . 'successors'. (ny2. (ii) Article 4(c)(3) -After 'royalty M insert 'per ton (2240 English pounds)'- (iii) Article 4(c)(5) Aftur 'royalty' insert 'per thousand cubic feet'. (iv) Article lOt sub-para^rauh 1, line 5« After 'lorries' insert 'aircraft'. (v) Article 10, sup-paragraph 1, last sentence* Revise to read: 'General merchandise and food supplies importea 'by it for the personal use of its employees the ordinary duty on goods of British merchants in force in the State of Qatar'. (vi) Article 15, page 6, line Cmit 'subject to the •.•it. approval of the Political Resident'. (vii) Article 1?, line 2. For 'own men' substitute 'subjects'. (viii) Omit Article 80. (ix) Article 21. line 2. Omit 'lawful'. (x) Article 21, lines 6/7. For 'In this Agreement the English text shall prevail' substitute ' in either text' the Sheikh and the Company agree to settle the matter by mutual - discussion, failing which they will refer the matter to arbitration in accordance with Article 16'. ( X i) New Article 22. Insert 'The terms year, month, day, as used in this Agreement refer to the solar calendar of England and to no other'. 5. The Company^ representatives were informed alter discussion that no objection was seen to alterations (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above; (v), having regard to the terms of the treaty between His Majesty's Government and Qatar and to the correspondence which had passed on this subject, was also unobjectionable. As for (vi), it was not quite clear whether the proviso had been inserted in the interests/m interests of the Company or of His Majesty's Government, 'but in view of the arbitration provisions of Article 16 no objection was seen to accepting the Company's proposal. No objection was seen to (vii). As regards (viii), the Company explained that the Sheikh conducted no banking transactions and liked his payments in cash. He would not welcome a reference to a bank (the reference had been inserted by the Company in the hope that it might facilitate dealings with the Sheikh). It was agreed that if this was the case there was no point in pressing for the inclusion of the Article, No objection was seen to (ix). As regards (x), it was impressed on the Company that it was in their interest as well as to some extent that of His Majesty's Government that provision should be mad© that the English text should prevail. They replied that the Sheikh of Qatar had very strongly urged that he knew no English himself,had no one in his State who knew English and did not employ for banking or for other purposes anyone with a knowledge of English. It was lelt that in these circumstances there v/as some justification for his request and the Company were informed that it they lound it impossible to secure his acceptance oi the Article as drafted they might assume our concurrence in their redraft. No objection was seen to (xi). The object ot the alteration was to prevent confusion owing to the use of a lunar calendar by the Sheikh. 6. The Company undertook to furnish a revised text of the Agreement. 7. As regards the second point reierred to in paragraph 3 above, the Company referred to the map produced by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company geologists (copies of which/4. 8./ which were circulated in February 1934), which showed a southern boundary ror Qatar which had been inaicated to the geologists by the Sheikh himself on the ground. The Company were anxious to know whether this boundary was satisfactory to His Majesty's Government for the purposes of the map to be appended to any agreement under the provisions of Article 2. They understood that there had been considerable recent discussion between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud over this boundary. The suggestion was even rumoured to have been made by Ibn Saud but not accepted that failing agreement commissioners might be appointed by the two parties to settle the difficulty. The Jebel Dukhan seemed likely to form part of a definitely oil- bearing structure and Ibn Saud was thus anxious to include the whole of it in his territory and so in the Hasa oil concession, while the Sheikh was not prepared to accept his view and claimed that his boundary ran either as shown in his map or south of it to Salwa. The Company were informed that the important thing seemed to be the limit of their concession, which need not necessarily be as extensive as that of the Sheikh's territories recognised by His Majesty's Government, or of any protection which they might give to him. It would, however, be necessary to examine the limit which they were anxious to fix with the other interested Departments. It was agreed in these circumstances that the Company should furnish copies of a map showing the suggested boundary and that endeavours should be made to let them have a decision before Mr.Mylies's departure for ^atar on 22nd January. The point was important as it would be necessary to attach the map to the concession put forward to the Sheikh.5. 8. Mr.Mylles, in CLnclusion, was asked what dilticulties in ;articula he anticipated with the Sheikh. He replied that the main difficulty would, of course, 'be finance. The Sheikh, on the other hand, was also suspicious of references to the Political Resident or of suggestions of closer control 'by His Majesty's Government, The Company could see no alternative to the reference to the Political Resident in Article 16 of the draft or they would have suggested one. But it might 'be that there would be difficulty on this point. The Company were given no reason to hope that His Majesty's Government would accept any modification of the draft on this point# Kowe i t Neutral Z one. Mr.Lefroy said that the Company had no lurther information as to developments in Neutral Zone. He was informed that His Majesty's Government were unaware of how matters at present stood, 'but that Mr. Jans on, Jnr. had some time ago intimated that the Arabian Development Syndicate, who retained an active interest in this question, we..e endeavouring to follow up their earlier negotiations, but would, ii they secured a concession, be prepared to transi'er it to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company on reasonable terms, e.g. something corresponding to out of pocket expenses plus an understanding about royalty. Thcj Company's representatives were informed that no diliiculties were seen about giving them this information, as there had been no suggestion that it was coni idential# 10* Mr.Lefroy, after further discussion, enquired whether His Majesty's Government would see any objection to the despatch of an I.P-C. geologist or representative to endeavour to secure from the Sheikh of Koweit an understand in/Itz 6. in respect ol' the Neutral Zone corresponding to that which was understood to have 'been reached between I'bn Saud and the Standard Oil. He was informed that rriina facie we saw no objection to action on these lines, which indeed, closely corresponded to what had previo isly 'been discussed with thb Anglo-Persian Oil Company, 'but he was invited to make a proposal for consideration in writing. 11# Oil in Abu Dhabi. Mr.Lefroy referred to the fact that, with the approval of His Majesty's Government, facilities had been given to an Anglo-Persian Oil Company geologist to assist the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi by sinking wells, an operation in the course of which he might have some opportunity of assessing the oil possibilities of this area. The geologist who had bten sent was interested in his results, and the Company desired to take matters further. The discovery of petroliferous strata in Bahrein (coupled with the probability that there was a valuable petroliferous stratum in Hasa and in the Jebel Dukhan in Qatar) had led to increased interest in this \yb_ole area. What would be our attitude towards the despatch of the American exploratory geologist who had now been attached to the I.P.C., with a small party, to conduct further researches in Abu Dhabi? 1S» Mr.Lefroy was informed that we were very anxious to facilitate the task of the British element in the I.P.O. of establishing themselves in these areas. But we should not at all welcome the despatch to the Trucial Coast of an American, or of any foreigner. As he and Mr.Mylles were aware, even English nationals were not at present allowed into the Trucial States except in quite exceptional circumstances.//f-? 7» circumstances. To send dov/n an American geologist, following especially on the establishment of the Standard Oil in Hasa and in Bahrein, might moreover very well prejudice their negotiations with the Sheikh of Qatar and might leave on the local Sheikhs &amp;c* the impression that the Americans were the interest of real importance# Would they in these circumstances consider, even though it might cause them inconvenience, finding an English geologist to do the work? If so, no obstacles would he placed in his way and he would he given all facilities. The Company would appreciate the political considerations involved, and the ract that the preferable alternative for His Majesty's Government to allowing exploration or development of these areas 'by foreigners was to close them (as had 'been their policy hitherto) for purposes of oil development to all parties# Mr.Lefroy undertook to consider the matter further.

Following our conversation on the 10th January,I now send you IS copies of a clean draft of the concession, giving effect to the verbal amendments which I understood then to be agreed, and which you have in red on the last copy I gave you of the draft of the 25th October. As regards the map to be attached, I arranged for the large map to be reduced to a double foolscap sheet for attachment, but on receiving these advance copies I see a note which I think v;ould better be omitted, and I am having further copies made without this note. I imagine that for your immediate necessities 5 copies will suffice; I can let you have more later on, I propose to have the name Dohah at least written in Arabic as well, but I am waiting for Mylles 1 return to London to ascertain exactly how it is spelt in Arabic. Our present plan is that Mylles shall leave by air for Abadan on the 22nd January, and after a short stay there to get his Arabic text brought up to date, will proceed at once to Qatr.

P*A« During the last few months lot of correspondence have taken place between KlngBin Sa'ud and the Ruler of Qatar on the subject of the Sa'udi Arbla and Qatar bcsindarles. Bin Sa'ud wrote to Shaikh 'Abdullah that the Qatar boundary should run from a line east of Jabal Idkhan{or Dakhan) to Khaur al 'Udaid, thus leaving the land to the north of this line to ^^the^on^to the south of it to the Sa'udi Arabia. contested this and claimed that &gt;e &lt;at,ar boundary should run from Dohat Salwah. In one of his letters Bin Sa'ud insisted that the boundary should be according to the line drawn by him. To this letter Shaikh •Abdullah replied that Qttar boundary should run from Dohat Salwah and added that he hoped that King Bin Sa'ud will not compel him to allude to other means which will not be in the nterest of both. The last letter he; received on the subject, that he considered the bouiidaries of both countries to be the same and that if Shaikh 'Abdullah wants, Jabal Idkhan majr be considered to be within Q%tar territory* 4.11.34 4 &gt;i ril * VNOTE. I left Bahrain on Tuesday the 30th October 1934 at ^.30 p.m. and arrived at Dohah on Wednesday the 31st October 1934 at 11.30 a.m. As the Shaikh was sleeping at the time of my arrival at Doha, I thought that it would be better if I waitea till the Dhuhr prayers are over. At 2 p.m. I went to the Palace but the Shaikh was still inside the Haram. His sons, f Ali Hamad and Hasan were sitting with tneir Fidawis in the eastern veranda without any carpets or mats. Half an hour later Shaikh T Abdullah came from the Earam when I salamed him and conveyed P.AIs Salams ana enquiry about his health. I then gave him the complimentary letter from P.A. After coffee was served he took me to the Ghurfah between the Haram and the Diwan. No one besides his son Hamad was present. 1 conveyed tne message of the Honourable the Political Piesident to him. The Shaikh said that he was very thankful to the Honourable the P.R. for his assistance and also for kiadly enuuiring about his health(leg). He also said that he was grateful to P.A. for his kind assistance in the matter. Besides these few words the Shaikh did no^say anything or ask any question about passes. Before conveying the message the Shaikh looked to be uneasy^but as soon as I informed him he put on a smiling face. The Shaikh then went inside the Haram and left his son Hamad with me. When his father went away Shaikh Hamad said that he heard that ftie Shaikh of Sharjah sold one of his Islands to the British Government and that Yusuf Kanu was sent to Sharjai it for this purpose. I told him that I did not hear about nor a about the departure of Yaauf Kanu to Sftarjah. He then asked if the ship of the Oil Company arrived at Bahrain and I told him that I did not hear anything about it#I heard that the ^haikia was given to understand that the oil Gompany are going to have one ship coming to Bahrain every week for liie purpose of taking oil. He/also said to have been very much impressed with/work in the Oil Field. 4.11.34I heard that when Shaikh Nasir,brother of Siiaikh 'Aoaullah who is living in Hasa with his family, came to '^atar recently,he, in the course of talk in the Majlis, told Shaikh Abdullah that from what he had seen and heara, the Americans ol the Oil Company in Hasa were very miser and. that there was no truth in the information communicated to him that they were very generous. Shaikh 1 Abdullah is said to have replied that he believed that the British nation were more generous than other people, but as a Company he thought that (Americans) they/offer better terms than others. Shaikh Nasir travelled with me on the same launch to Doha. He praises Bin Sa'ud very much but talks ill of the officials whom he says are sucking the blood of the poor in the name of Bin Sa T ud. He says tnat he is very happy in Hasa where he spe*is six months in sport. He had five hawks with him four of which ne purchased from Bahrain and one was given to him by H#E.Shaikh Hamad. When we reached near Lusail Shaikh Nasir said 1 This is the village in which I used to live with my father and brothers before I became angry with t Abdullah and went to Hasa T . I hear that Shaikh T Abdullah does not like him but he is very much afraid of him. Shaikh Nasir lold me that he will spend four days at Doha and then leave for Hasa by land route. When I was at Doha I heard that the Shaikh of ^atar asked A.P .O .G. to have his cars sent to Abbadan for repairs and , ^ also to supply him with electric lights but they refused to | comply with any of nis requests. The Shaikh has therefore uv^ ^ decided to take customs duty on things arriving for tnem at i 1 Doha.
