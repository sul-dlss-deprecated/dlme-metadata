Hickinbotham, O.B^E., Political Agent &amp; H .B.M 's Consul, Muscat. To The Hon 1 ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Eushire. Sir, I have the honour to refer to my letter No. G/198 dated the 25th July 1939. 2- At His Highness's request I went to Qantab to see him on Saturday July 29th returning to Muscat on the morning of July 30th. I had a long interview with His Highness on the morning of the 29th and several private conversations at various times later in the day and again on the morning of the 30th of July. After dealing with various minor problems which form the subject of separate communications to you,such as the ^ 56&gt;5, jb.a7 , ' appointment of a Jemadar from the Indian Army to the Levy and Ou s Sho', 1 a 4- ^r a skilled and ( 'the request for a Skilled and energetic man from India as Secretary to the Biladiya, His Highness asked me for my opinion regarding the restoration of the Arms Subsidy and if I thought that his request would be granted. I replied that I was not in a position to express any opinion on the subject. His Highness then referred to the various arguments that he has rward from already put and said that the financial position of the State was causing him considerable / concernconcern and that he hoped that bearing in mind his obvious need the Government of India would see their way to assisting him. I mentioned here that his financial position as shown by the statements that were received by us showed that-the finances of the State were better than they had been and that ii ^ the budget was being balanced. He stated that this was so but that there was nothing to spare for improvements and unforeseen expenses nor was there a margin from which to meet a serious reduction in revenue. He also stated that his rese rves were inadequate. I said that I had examined the last statement that he had sent to the Consulate but that I could not remember the actual figures. His Highness then said that his reserve was about two lakhs. That the figures in the statement did show a balanced budget and that they were accurate as a reference to his bank passbook,which he kept himself would show. 4. His Highness stated that he was endeavouring to regain control of Oman and thereby become ruler of the whole of his State. He worked and hoped for the reunion under one ruler of Muscat and Oman. He had been extending his influence with the sheikhs of the interior and had been spend ing his own private funds to augment the budget allotment for presents. The method that he was employing to attain his object was by making contacts with the tribal leaders and in some cases alloting to them monthly stipends. The only other way to regain control of the country was by force which was not only expensive but left enmity and bitterness which took years to overcome. He had thought that by peaceful means alone he would be able to carry out his plan successfully but that now he had come to the conclusion that he must have force as well as funds. He anticipated that he would require a / force- 3 - 0 force (permanent) of 1,000 men to reassert his authority and - 1 r ' tU ' -| i 't rt, Tji ■'i i : ******* *m~ywir j maintain control. He did not think that it would be necessary to make use of this force in warlike operations against his tribes as its moral effect would probably be sufficient. 5. His Highness said that he had nothing to spare for social work in the towns of Muscat and Matrah. He could not undertake necessary Public Health measures. He was unable to carry out any scheme for a closer control of the Customs as he had no capital.. In fact he was unable to develop his country way ^ in any Rowing to his lack of funds. i _ i .-n i -n , ^ ' • •• »WBI ' 6. His sole reserve amounted to only two lakhs of rupees. A very inadequate sum considering the size of the country and the possibility of unforeseen expenditure occurring at any time. Once these two lakhs were exhausted he would be bankrupt. 7. His Highness said that he was working single handed as he had no one he could rely upon. That he had no one who was capable of independent action or who could work without continual supervision. He was doing his best but he found that the constant effort to balance his budget and his financial inability to carry out necessary works very disheartening. 8. His Highness went on to say that he had thought of every possible way to raise the necessary funds for his purposes but he could only see one possible course of action. He was loath to mention his intention but it had come to the point where he must either obtain financial assistance to carry out his ideas or give everything up and retire to Dhofar and let Muscat carry on as best as it could while he occupied himself with improving the Dhofar province or else follow his father's example and abdicate. His Highness then asked me ''tlVninlii-.'- ■ n.nui ■■uq,..! i iii-'ii«ii i -t—— '♦ v - ''''' &gt;1* whether I thought that the Government of India '* '''i urn n« - -a* / would lease\-'M would lease Qvyadur from him or if they were not prepared to do that would they be prepared to accord him financial assistance if he ceded Gwadur to them. In other words sold Gwadur. I said that I was really unable to express any views ofithe subject but that I would seek your advice. His Highness pressed me for my personal opinion but I told him that I had no idea of the value of Gwadur to the Government of India or if it was of any value to them at all and could not possibly therefore give an opinion. 9. His Highness thought that the ceding of Gwadur would cause some comment in the interior but not sufficient to materially affect his prestige. He felt that it was a question of Gwadur or Oman and Oman was the more important. 10. On more than one occasion His Highness remarked that he was tired of the present state of affairs and that if financial assistance was not forthcoming he would leave matters 0 Sovl- to sought themselves out. If he had had a son he said that the position would be different. If he did leave he had no idea who would follow in his footsteps. Saiyid Nadr was no longer well and the other members of the family would not unite in favour of any one individual. He ended up by hinting that His Majesty's Government would have to solve the problem. 11. The situation as I see it is that the Sultan has come to the conclusion that to carry out his political plans in ■■ ■ iii i hi in).miii -i - i.iwi ... -i— regard to Oman he must have force as well as money. The finances of the State are not sound. -The State has not an adequate reserve and I believe that payment of daily and monthly commitments from the Treasury for the ordinary working of the Government depends on whether sufficient revenue has been collected. Up to date there has been sufficient revenue but it is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs. The Sultan / cannot obtain5 - cannot obtain any financial assistance from the State towards the cost of the force he hopes to raise. He has been using the income he derives from the Oil Concessions to meet the bill for gifts and stipends to tribal chiefs but I am inclined to think that he is unwilling to continue spending this money unless he is convinced that his ambitions will be realised. 1 a f air percentage of the money from the Petroleum Concessions Limited is banked in a private account as an. insurance against a rainy day. If he is to continue his policy money must be found. If money is not forthcominr: he must abandon his attempt at domination of Oman and be content to continue as de facto ruler of only half his State. mwks&amp;y' He is not content to do this. Either he will find the money and carry out his plan or else he will give up the attempt and leave the management of Muscat to other hands and retire to Dhofar or leave the country altogether. He has examined every possible way of raising money and at last has been driven to suggesting the ceding of a part of his State in return for financial assistance. 12. There are three alternative courses of action which 111 ' i- - - i'•wm* • omik. bbrrvj' ■'•ww.*'''' 1 inumwnw xwea.; wwaemw- I will examine generally. I am not competent to speak with authority on some aspects of the case and the selection of the most advantageous course to be pursued must necessarily follow after con si deration of the man^r factors involved including the Agreement (1862) bux. I wish to record now my views on the position. The alternatives are (a).To accede to His Highness f s request and make a substantial financial contribution in return for Gwadur. ■jk)• To refuse further financial assistance, (c).To take over control of the State of Muscat and Oman. His Highness would retain the title and control of the / province of6 (3) Vf province of Dhofar. In addition he would receive a reasonable stipend from the Muscat revenues. 13* The first of these alternatives means the grant to His Highness of a very considerable sum of money in return for very little. The revenue this year from Gwadur will probably amount to Rs. 70,000 as opposed to Rs.1,03,000 last year^ I am unable to speak on the subject of the value of Gwadur to India or rather to Kalat State but it is clear that the fall in revenue is largely due to the Kalat blockade which should Gwadur revert to Kalat will be removed with a resulting improvement in the revenue. The Sultan considers that the revenue from Oman will compensate him for the loss of Gwadur and will meet the additional expenditure on the maintenance of his standing army of one thousand men. He hopes to further improve his financial position by introducing a customs preventive service to stop evasion of duty. I feel that His Highness is overestimating for I do not consider that the Oman revenue will meet these extra commitments. It may be possible to develop the country and thus increase its revenue but surveys must be made first and a capital sum will be required to meet the cost of development. Years must pass before a return can be expected. I believe that the grant of a large sum of money will be only putting off the crisis for a year or two. 14. The second alternative is to do nothing or rather to refuse financial assistance. The result of this will be that the Sultan will leave Muscat to its fate and will retire to Dhofar. He will have the revenue from the province which is considerable and in addition for three or four years the Rs. 8,000 a month which Petroleum Concessions Limited are paying. / Muscat and7 - Muscat and Oman will be left to any one who is strong enough to hold them. There will be trouble in Oman and in the Batinah. The importance to us of Muscat and Oman strategically will no doubt determine the policy which we will adopt. The damage to British Indian commercial interests and the necessity for the protection of British Indian lives and property must be taken into consideration. I feel that we shall have to i ^.' terfere 3X1(1 at least ma intain law and order on the coast and ... , , in the principal towns. The adoption of this policy will result in a very unsatisfactory state of affairs which will ^rove very troublesome and expensive. IS- The last alternative is to come to agreement with Prance and the Sultan and place him in much the same position as the Sultan of Morocco. As long as he is in receipt of a re^-i'-ar income he will be more than happy in Dhofar•. As long as he is the titular head there can be no question of a successor and dynastic rows will be avoided for the time being. Such money as may be necessary to carry on Government will be controlled by us. With careful management and supervision I believe that the financial position can be much improved and + tfrie tnat tne presence of a squadron of/Royal Air Force in Muscat or Matrah with a detachment of Indian Troops will be sufficient to maintain security. Operations might and probably would have to be undertaken in the interior but these would be exclusively air operations. Political Officers could do much towards a better understanding with the tribes. The strategic value of Muscat would be much increased and its commercial value would be greatly improved. 16.

I pressed him to shelve the question for the time being hinting that his immediate needs would be met by the Subsidy. His answer that the Subsidy was for a specific purpose and his indication that it must be used for that purpose was of course entirely correct, although I am certain that a portion will be diverted into channels which could scarcely be considered legitimate, however careful a watch is kept on the expenditure.

I handed the Sultan a written communication No. C/S14 dated the 30th November 1939 and a further letter of explanation, No. C/615 dated the 30th November 1939. The Sultan said that he would consider the communication and consult me before reply ing. He asked if any points mentioned by him at our interview on August the 30th had been left out of the letter now handed to him. I said 'no' and read to him my telegram No. 260 of August 30th. 2. I suggested that he would probably like to shelve the question of the sale of Gwadur now that an increase in his forces was jossible without it being necessary to raise money in that direction. The Sultan said he would consider the question. He saxd that the money now to be received was for a specific purpose, i.e. defence, and he would not be able to use it for improvements in the administration for which purpose a part of the amount to be raised by the sale of Sv/adur was to be set aside. ^' The oultan asked if the Government of India would be likely to give a definite reply regarding the Arms Subsidy. I said I thought that it wae unlikely until peace had once more come to the Smpire.

I enclose a short note on Gwadur which you may find of interest. Appendix 'B' will take some time while to prepare. The Hon'hle Lt.-Col.C.G.Prior, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire•Mtesk* Th» Gwadur District includes not only the town of that name and the coastal villages of Peshkan and Sur but also the area known as Gwadur-i-Niger and Jebel-i-llehdi and certainly the southern slopes, possibly the whole of the Koh-i-Dram range t not to mention one or two insignificant hills features to the west of Qwadur— i—Nigor• It is not possible to estimate the area of the district as the boundaries have never been delineated and some difference of opinion is known to exist on the exact extent of the area. Uetitib If the question of the Gwadur boundary arose it is possible that the Sultan of Muscat would claim that the watershed of the Talar range from the Talar Pass in the east to Kandasul in the west formed his northern frontier, a line drawn south from the Talar Pass passing close to Sarchib and following the Karwat torrent to its entrance into the sea as his eastern frontier, and a line running south-west from the Talar range to Qabd and from thence south south-easterly to meet the coast at Ganz as his western limit* It is probable that the Khan of Kalat would consider that the area belonging to the Sultan of Muscat was bound in the north by the Koh^i-Dram watershed, in the east by a line from the Koh-i-Dram south to the mouth of the Drabello torrent and in the west by a line following the course of the Ankaro torrent from the Koh-i-Dram to the sea* In addition it is possible that a am«n isolated area bounded on the north by the Pheleiri torrent and running south to the coast to include the village of Peshkan would also be conceded as Muscat territory* The probable frontier and the one favoured by Captain Ross who was Assistant Political Agent at Gwadur for some years follows the course of the Barambab torrent from the sea north to the Koh-i-Dram and thence continues along the top of this rangeto the foot of the spur east of Gar-i-loh and from there turns due south and passing west of Chatti strikes the coast three or four miles w^st of Ras Peshkan. Physical Feature « The coast line is low and consists of sand dunes• The only conspicuous features are Ras Sur at the eastern extremity of East Gwadur Bay| Gwadur Head a hammer headed rocky promontory some seven miles in length east and west) and about one and a half to two miles in depth north and south the highest point of which is Koh-i-Batil an irregular mass of cliffs about four hundred and eighty feet high overlooking Gwadur towny and Ras Peshkan a rocky headland. The Dram hills form part of the Mekran coast range* They are barren uninviting looking hills, and the highest peaks are Barn (3,152), Dram (3,125), and Mukh (3,200). At the base of this range lies the area known as Gwadur-i-Nigor or more often just the Nigor. The surface of this area a little distance from the foot hills is moderately flat and in extent the Nigor reaches down to within a mile or two of the coast in the easterly part of the Gwadur District while it seems to be bounded by the course of the Ankaro torrent in the west. The Nigor proper meets the Gwadur sands six miles north of Gwadur town and from thence westward these sands are two or three miles in depth. To look at, the Nigor is a moderately flat plain with numerous groups of large trees with here and there a cluster of tall date palms. The impression is received, from a distance, that it is a land of plenty and each group of trees shades a village • Closer acquaintance with the area shows how deceptive first impression can be. There are no permanent dwellings in the whole area* In the shade of the groups of trees one or two 7 fields have been ploughed and a primitive form of dam or bank has been constructed to collect the rain water for all the agri culture in this area depehds on rain either over the area itself or in the Dram hills from whence it is brought by numerous flmai i torrents. There are no wells for purposes of cultivation and / even the«ven the drinking water is brackish. The inhabitants live in rude temporary structures consisting of a wooden frame covered with palm leaf mats and move from place to place as cultivation is made possible by rain or the grazing needs of their sheep and goats demand. The area contains no rivers? the Karwat, Barambab, and Ankaro are the most important hill torrents. The first two rise in the DrSm range while the Ankaro rises in the Saiji range and passes through the Dram range to find its way across the western Nigor into the sea through a large salt water creek twenty-three miles north-west of Gwadur town. Six miles north north-east of Gwadur town there is a small mud volcano. It is at sea level or only very little above and consists of a small pool of grey muddy water forty yards in circumference which is in continual movement. Occasionally it becomes active and the water is thrown up some distance into the air. There is no smell and little bubbling to be seen at the surface. There is said to be another such volcano in East Gwadur Bay and periodical discolour ation of the sea which is accompanied by the death of quantities of fish is put down to its activities. Climate and Water S upp I v. The climate approximates to the climate of Karachi but ha.3 prac wiCcau-ly no rainfall during the summer and is consequently somewhat hotter than Karachi. In September fans are unnecessary. Malaria is prevalent in the town but not to amy great extent. In Gwadur town the water is brackish but near the Political Bungalow there is fresh water at a depth of ten feet. This water has no unpleasant flavour. The rainfall is light. The total population of the area is about seven thousand persons. Of these nearly five thousand are resident in Gwadur town, one thousand in Gwadur-i-Nigor, five hundred in Peshkan and four hundred in Sur. The figures according to communities are given in Appendix 'A'. Manufactures. The only manufacture is salt which is sun dried in pans / south ofI i \ O) -L south of Gwadur town. The salt is used for local consun^tion and fish curing. There is a small salt tax. Comnunications. A motor able track runs from Gwadur town to Jiwani. The distance is about ninety miles and the time usually taken is three and a half hours. Camel tracks run to Suijajnd Peshkan and Turbat and other pi.aces in Kaj-at, State. The hiring price of a camel is rupee one a day and the camel ma^s food to be provided by the hirer. It is usually found convenient to pay an extra eight annas a day per head and not have the trouble of feeding the men. Transport and in- aift erent trotting camels can be obtained within twenty«»four hours from the Nigor. Administration. The Sultan of Muscat and Oman is represented by a Governor of the Gwadur area who resides in Gwadur town. He is assisted by a Deputy Governor at Peshkan and by two Kohdas or head men of the Baluchis living in Gwadur town. There is a Qadhi who hears civil cases and whose decisions are subject to the Governor^ confirmation. The head man of the Nigor Baluchis receives Rs. 14 a month for advising the Governor in Nigor cases. The Governor's salary amounts to rupees two hundred and fifty a month, the Deputy Governor at Peshkan, an elderly Arab who has married locally and speaks proudly of his hundred fcl or more descendants rupees sixty a month and the two Kohdas rupees ten each a month. The Governor has a force of thirty Arab Askaries to help him maintain order. The majority of this force live in Gwadur town but a square stone built fort within a quarter of a mile of the Political Bungalow which commands all the approaches to the town has a garrison of ten men. &amp;§£££&amp;' There is an Am in of Customs who is assisted t^y a clerical establishment of four persons and who is subordinate to the Director of Customs at Muscat. He is responsible for the collection of all import duties and octroi. The octroi revenue is included in the Customs Revenue figures and the Customs revenue for 1939-40 was Rs. 85,093 and the cost of maintenance of the establishment at Gwadur B9Hi-.i 1 H 'town and 'the Customs clerk at Peshkan was in 1939-40 Rs« 19,644. Qwadur Town. Gwadur town lies at the southern extremity of the narrowest part of a narrow sandy promontory which terminates in Gwadur Head. It is a fortnightly port of call for ships of the British India Steam Navigation Company whose vessels anchor some four miles off shore in East Gwadur Bay. The population of the town are with very exceptions ail engaged in the fish trade* Fish and crustaceans of various sizes and kinds from prawns to sharks are plentiful and are caught both in nets and on hand lines. The catch is sold morn- and afternoon) after one tenth has been taken by the Customs officials as fish tax f to dealers from the town who dry and salt the fish and after grading and sising export it to Ceylon and the Par East. The grades| kinds and sizes are too numerous to mention. Indian shopkeepers supply the needs of the fishermen and merchants alike both in the way of food and clothes but also by stocking and selling cotton fibre for lines and netS| sail cloth 9 nails and the hundred and one things essential to people earning their living by and on the sea. Of recent years trade in dried fish has been very dull and consequently Gwadur merchants have suffered financially 9 lately however things have looked a little better and there is a hope of a return of prosperity. Small quantities of cotton and wool are also expor^tsd and the figures for all exports and imports for the year 1939-40 are given in Appendix 'B*. The Post and Telegraph Sub Office is under the control of the Superintendent of Posts and Telegraphs az Hyderabad, Sind. The telegraph is a line which is by no means reliable being often out of order. British Representative There is a resident British Agent subordinate to the Political Agent and H.B.M's Consul at Muscat. The British Agent is a Magistrate of the 3rd Class and hears minor criminal cases* Civil cases and major criminal cases are dealt with by the Political Agent who visits Gwadur periodically.

It includes a letter from Captain T Hickinbotham, Political Agent and Consul, Muscat, to the Political Resident, Bushire, dated 31 July 1939, recording a recent visit to the Sultan of Muscat [Said bin Taimur] at which the Sultan stated that he was endeavouring to regain control over Oman and mentioned his inability to develop his country due to lack of funds, whereupon discussions took place on the possible cession of Gwadar to the Government of India in return for financial assistance. Hickinbotham suggests to the Resident that there are three possible courses of action: to make a substantial financial contribution to the Sultan in return for Gwadar, to refuse further financial assistance, or to take over control of Muscat and Oman, which would, with the agreement of France, place the Sultan in the same position as the Sultan of Morocco, with the Sultan’s income controlled by the British Government, and with British and Indian forces stationed in Oman to maintain security. Further correspondence records discussions over assistance for the Sultan and the possible sale of Gwadar, September-December 1939. The final item is a memorandum by Captain Hickinbotham containing information on the geographical extent, physical features, climate and water supply, population, manufactures, communications, administration, and customs of Gwadar District; a description of Gwadar town; and notes on the British representative, with covering letter to the Resident dated 9 October 1940.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman Sa'īd ibn Taymūr Āl Bū Sa'īd</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>James Orton</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Francis Warden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Hugh Weightman</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Gwādar</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Būshehr</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000161#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
