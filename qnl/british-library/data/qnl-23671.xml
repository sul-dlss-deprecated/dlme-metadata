The emoluments which c^n ee t .ken into account under Article 486 in the case of an officer officiating in a higher permanent appointment are not only the emoluments referred to in clause (h) of that Article but also'those referred to in clause (j) thereof. The sub stantive ' holder of a permanent post who holds a temporary post is likely to draw under Article 760, Civil Service Regulatio deputation -(duty) allowance (i.e. special pay) which counts ^ for pension under Article 486 (i).

This prpctice is not in accordance with the rules .• nd results in some pecuniary loss to the pensioner in os es in which the applicant is likely to have a birthday jefore the i sport on the title to pension is subattted. In order to avoid this delay and save th« pen sioner from loss it has been decided by the Ajiditor General | * lth the concurrence of the Government of India, that Accounts Oft icers should issue a report on the commutation of pension ln advance of the forma 1 r eport on th? title to pension, in caces in which the report on the title to pension is not likely to 'oe issued in sufficient time to permit of arrange ments being carried through before the applicant's ne xfe iiitet birthday; provided that the portion of the pension tobe ifommuted is clearly we 11 be low one half of the approximate amount of the tota1 pension likely to be sanctioned and theuncommute&lt;3 residue of the likely pension is also well above the limits prssoribed In rules S and 4 of the Civil Pension (Commutation) Rules.

F # 9/16/36-Ests•, dated the 4th September 1936, A case recently occurred in which an officer offi ciating in a selection post was, as a result of a depart mental enquiry, found guilty of negligence and incompetence and was ordered to revert to his substantive appointment as soon as an officer senior to him returned from leave. It was further ordered that he should not be allowed to officiate again in a selection post until he had earned at least tvvo rtally good reports in his substantive appoint ment. The question has now arisen whether the latter order amounted to the infliction of any of the penalties mentioned in Rule 49 of the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal)Rules or whether it amounted merely to non- selection for a selection post. 2. The distinction between ^ensure, the withholding of promotion and non-selection for a selection post is of considerable importance. Both censure and the withholding ' of promotion are appealable under Rule 56 of the Civil Services (classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, and under Rule 10(a) of the Public Service Commission (Func tions ) Rules, 1926, such appeals must be preferred to the Public Service Commission* Moreover under Rule 10(b) of the Public Service Commission (Functions) Rules» 1926, consultation with the public Service Commission is neces- sary before any order withholding promotion is passed, but such prior consultation is not necessary in the case of censure. On the other hand, nonrselection for a selection post is not appealable and does not require consultation with the Public Service Commission.If an officer, because of an unsatisfactory record and unfavourable confidential reports, is no t seated for a selection post and ao^e other officer junior to him is selected in preference, this does not amount to the with holding of promotion, if any enquiry is held against an officer and an order of censure is passed on him, it is open to him to appeal, if he doe8 not appeal ^ xs rejected, and if subsequently bdcause of the existence of this censure in his record he is not selected for a selection post and some oth*r officer junior to him is sele- cted in preference, this also does not amount to the with- aiding of promotion. If. h o wever , an enquiiy is ^ against an officer and an order is passed that he should b« promoted to a selection post for a definite period or until he has obtained good reports, this order would amount to the infliction of the penalty of withholding pro- motion. The distinction between non-election for a selec- tion post and the withholding of promotion M y be summed UP as keing that in the forffier ^ offioer ^ dered x or aelection but some other officer is &gt;re ferred 4 n his merits, while in the latter ca.e the officer in question has been declared before hand, as a discipli nary measure, to be ineligible for selection irrespective of the merits of the other officers available. • • • ; \ \-ffioe weiaorandum from tte Government of India in the Finance pepartment Ho.ff.5(3).&amp;. i/56 dated the 14th jpv 011QU01 4 subject*- Decision that house rent aljowence Bhould not be taken into consideretion in fixing the initial pay of Government servants on appointiment to ^o£«ts to which no such allowances are attached. very now end then proposals ere received by the /J'lnance Department for the fixation of pay m poete to which no housse rent -&gt;310*snce le attached, on the baaie ot pay jglue house rent allowance in poate preTiouely held.

Government of India, To All Minor Local Governments, Subjects- Calculation of ''earned leave' under the Revised Leave Rules, 1933. Sir, I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with this Department letter No. F.7(57)-H.I/34, dated the 26th October 1934 and to say that a question has arisen as to how 'earned leave' under the Revised Leave Rules,1933, should be calculated. In calculating leave on average pay under the Fundamental Rules the period of duty rendered by a Government servant is reckoned in terms of years, months and days according to Fundamental Rule 9(18) and the Audit Instruction tnerounder, and the leave earned and granted is similarly expressed. Under the Revised Leave Rules the maximum amount ot 'earned leave' has been expressed in days and consequently the method of calculation of 'earned leave' will be different from that followed in the calcula tion ox 'privilege leave' or 'leave- on average pay ? . It has accordingly been decided that in calculating r earned leave t the actual number of days of duty performed should first be counted and then multiplied by one-eleventh or one- twenty second as the case may be, the product expressed in daysdays (and fractions of a day) and limited to 120 or 90 days or 30 days respectively being the 'earned leave' admissible under Rules 9 and 10 of the Revised Leave Rules ? 1933.

Under these rules officers whose contract is for a period longer than 5 years or whose original contract of 5 years is ex- into tended or who are taken / permanent employment become subject to the special or the ordinary leave rules in the Fundamental Rules. .A question has arisen whether the conditions and terms of the Fundamental Rules which provide for the con cessions referred to above in a limited sense - v ide .

The model leave terms are nothing more than .Supplementary Rules framed unde r Fundament al Rule 103 end therefore subject to the over-riding condition laid down in the proviso to that rule that the rules should, not be more advantageous than the leavem -2- terms applicable to permanent Government servants. The Governor General in Council is accordingly pleased to decide that in any case where the contract provides for admission to the special or the ordinary leave rules in the Fundamental Rules the conditions as well as the terms of the Fundamental Rules should apply In their entirety in supersession of any concessions under the model leave terms.

It will be observed from paragraph 2 clause eight of the Secretary of State's telegram No. 2179, dated the 27th April 1921 that the primary object of paragraph 8 of the Resolution was to allow service in administrative posts v/han they were not on time scales to count for incre ments in the time-scales which were subsequently sanction ed, in other words, the orders Y/ere mea,nt only for the transitional stage when posts on graded pay were changed to time-scales. The Government of India have consulted the Auditor General who agrees that outside the transi tional stage these orders dlo no t permit any concessions which are not now admissible under the ordinary Funda mental Rules, while on the other hand they restrict the grant of the concession of counting leave for increment in a temporary post which is permissible under Fundamental Rule 26(d). As, however, these orders are protected by Fundamental Rule 21 in the case of time-scales sanctioned by the Secretary of St^te, his sanction is necessary to their cancellation. Should any case arise in which concessionsconcessions admissible under Fundamental Rules cannot be applied to a period of service in an administrative post, the Auditor Genei'al has suggested that the Government of India should be authorised to apply the principles of the Fundamental Rules in consultation with the Auditor General* 5o I am to request that the Secretary of State in Council may also be moved to sanction the proposal as set forth in paragraph 4 above. • paragraph 3 of Extract//letter No. F-lSSS/se, dated the 1st April 1936 ? .from the India Office, London, to the Govern ment of India, Home Department• Subjects- Conditions of Service attached to the post of .Deputy Director, Intelligence, Government of India, Peshawar.

Subject % - Method of allocation of leave^salaries of Govern ment servants subject to the Revised Leave Rules. I am directed to invite a reference to paragraph 3 of this Department letter No .u/SSGl- 11 , dated the 11th April 19o5, in which it was laid down that when a Government servant subject to the Revised Leave Rules is transferred permanently to another Government, the .oidit Officer of the lending Government should draw up a subsidiary leave account indicdting the amount of 'earned leave' at credit, leave salary for which will be borne by the Government from which the Government servant is transferred, and send it to the Audit Officer of the Government to which the Government servant is transferred. This procedure cannot be applied to non-gazetted Government servants as the records of service and the service books of such Government servants are maint .ined by the heads of oifices and not by the Audit Officers. The Government of India have threfore decided that when a non-gazetted Government servant subject to the Revised Leave Rules is transferred perm.: nently to another Government, the he:.d of the office from which he is transferred should prepare a leave account showing the amount of 'earned leave' ..t credit on the d'.te 01 perm, nent transfer .and send it to the head of the office to which the Government servant is transferred. A copy of the leave account should also be sent at the sane time to the audit Caficer of the office from which the Government servant is transferred so as to enable him to accept the debit on account of leave salary for 'earned le .-ve', up to the extent inaic ted in the le .ve account, as and when the Government servant takes leive. 2. I am to express the hope that the local Government will be agreeable to adopt the procedure indicated in p a? .graph 1 .bove which only supplements the procedure laid down in this Department letter referred to in paragraph 1 above.

Home Department, Simla, the 10th August 19?5 Office Memorandum The undersigned is directed to invite a reference to the rules for the imposition of penalties on members of the subordinate services under the administrative control of the Governor General in Council (published with the Home Department notifica tion Ho.F.9-19/?.0-Fsts., dated the ^7th February 19^2). These rules contain no provision for the imposition of fines as a penalty on inferior servants, as it was felt that this fo^m of punishment was too drastic 1n the t case of lo^ r —paid employes. The matter was, however, considered further immediately after the promulgation of the rules referred to above but was not proceeded with, as it was thought that such a provision was neither desirable nor necessayy. 2. It has now been suggested that the Question should be reconsidered in view of the facts that in the case of inferior servants fining is a more convenient and suitable form of punishment than those permissable under the rules, that while censure may be inadequate as a penalty for minor misdemeanours and delinquencies, the withholding o^ increments is not one that is awardahle ±n cases when the posts are on fixed rates of pay and not on aftime scale, and that in such cases the only other penalties awai-'dahle ( i.e. reduction, suspension, removal and dismissal) are too severe ^or the offence to be punished. In these circumstances, the punishing authority may be forced either to impose no punish ment at all or to inflict one which is unduly heavy. On the other hand, it should not be forgotten that fining 'Vs a ^ ott * i of_ v appears to h s; ve }? en caused by ^he absence of si form of punishment# In cases of minor mis-e^neanour« ^nd delinquencies, p rarnl.ng produces tbe desired e^^ect, and in those of grve misconduct or repeated minor delinquencies , the peral : t^&gt;7« laid do^-r in rule - of the Pules relating to Subordinate Services published vith the Home Department Notification No«F• 9-19A'-O-f.ss•, datei' the P^th February 19F?, can he imposed.

Various changes have been made in the ori ginal draft in order to meet criticisms by local Governments and others, and the result is embodied in the draft 'Superior Civil Services (Extra ordinary Pension) Rules' forwarded herewith (Enclosure No. 1). The more important features in the draft rules, and certain points arising from your letter, dated the 5th April 1934, are discussed in the succeeding paragraphs, and points of detail are dealt with in the expla natory memorandum which forms Enclosure No. 3 to this letter. 2. (a) The views of the Government of India on the suggestion that provisions on the lines of the British Police Pensions Act might be more satisfactory than the existing regulations for officers and members of the Police Forces in India were communicated to you in the letter from the Government of India, Home Department, No. 29/F.-106/XI/32-Police, dated the 23rd April 1934. Briefly, the conclusions of the Government of India were:— (1) that there is neither need nor justification for so radical a change in principle as would be involved, and (2) that even if the changes were necessary or desirable, it would be inadvisable to delegate discretionary powers (which appears to be inevitable in any such scheme), to Inspectors-General of Police or any other Heads of Departments. (b) The Government of India have also given careful consideration to the suggestion that some of the features of the rules in the Warrant framed under the Superannuation Act, 1887, applicable to civil servants in the United Kingdom, might be adopted. In particular, it has been suggested that widows' pensions might be based on the fraction specified in that War rant, namely, one-sixth of salary, subject to a maximum of £300 per annum. One of the cardinal principles on which this revision should, in the opi nion of the Government of India, be based is that the new rules should not be less liberal than those in Chapter XXXVIII, Civil Service Regulations, and that they should not be made materially more generous than the rules ^ in that Chapter save where this course is necessary in order to remove ? obvious anomalies, such as that which results from the different methods of determining relative military rank prescribed in Article 740, Civil Service Regulations. # When the suggestion referred to above is examined in detail it becomes apparent that the proposed arrangement would not satisfy this principle. Calculations show that it would in several cases involve too extravagant increases in awards, while in a few cases the amounts would be less than those now admissible. Again, it is intended that the existing rules should be superseded once and for all when the new rules come into operation, and the adoption of an entirely new basis for the assessment of awards would mean many changes of detail from the nrinciples of the existing rules which the Gov ernment of India would prefer to avoid.The Government of India consider that there is neither any real neces sity nor full justification for adopting the principles of, or the scales in r the Warrant framed under the Superannuation Act, 1887, particularly as. their adoption is to some extent impracticable. They have therefore draft ed rules which, while they adhere in the main to the principles of the exist ing rules, involve no references to obsolete military regulations and are entirely self-contained. The degree of simplification thus achieved has been welcomed by the various authorities in India who have scrutinised the draft rules. No criti cisms have been made on the score of the rules being complicated. 3. With reference to paragraph 2 of your letter, dated the 5th April 1934, T am directed to say that the Government of India are provisionally disposed to agree with the suggestion, so far as officers recruited hereafter are concerned, that civilians serving in a military capacity with a military force should be granted casualty pensions under military rules, but, as the possibility of an officer so serving in a capacity substantially inferior in status to his civil status cannot altogether be excluded, they consider that the existing right to elect as between the civil and the military rules should be retained in respect of officers now in service. Civil officers serving in a military capacity with a military force are subject for the time being to military law, and no provision for such officers can be made in these rules. It is therefore proposed to make whatever provisions are eventually considered to be necessary in the appropriate mili tary rules, and a separate communication on the subject will be made in due course. Again, while the majority of civilians serving with a military force, who hitherto would have served in a civil capacity, will in future serve in a military capacity, it is still possible that there may be occasions when civilians will serve with a military force in a civil capacity, and provision has therefore been made in these rules to cover such cases. 4. In paragraph 3 of the India Office letter, dated the 5th April 1934, it has been remarked that the necessity under existing rules for references to the Secretary of State has occasioned delay in disposing of cases and that such delay is undesirable. The Government of India fully agree with this view, and therefore, in framing these rules, they have sought to give to local Governments as large a measure of power as seems expedient. Disregarding for the moment draft rule 5, it will be observed that the occa sions when a reference to the Secretary of State would be required are limited to those on which it is clearly necessary that he should be consulted. Attention has recently been directed, however, to sub-section (6) of sec tion 247 of the Government of India Act, 1935. It appears to the Govern ment of India that while a case such as that of an award of less than the maximum admissible under a rule expressly conferring discretion within specified limits as to the amount to be awarded is not the kind of case at which the sub-section is aimed, there seems to be no doubt that such a case is within the sub-section as drawn and that the consent of the Secre tary of State will be required in every case to the award of an amount less than the maximum admissible. It would be possible to ignore this provision in the Government of India Act, 1935, when framing these draft rules, since there is likely to be a short period between the date on which the rules commence to operate and that, on which the sub-section comes into force. The Government of India feel, however, that it would be preferable to anticipate the forthcoming constitu tional position in this, as in other respects, and to this end they have inserted draft rule 5. As already stated, the Government of India understand that sub-section (6) of Section 247 of the Act was not aimed at this class of case, and, more over, it is likely to introduce just that element of delay which both the Secretary of State and the Government of India wish to avoid but therenow seems no way of circumventing that difficulty. When in any case it is proposed to make an award of less than the maximum amount admissi ble, there appears to be no reason, however, why the local Government should not commence paying provisionally the amount they consider should be awarded pending receipt of the Secretary of State's orders as to the actual amount to be awarded, and, unless the Secretary of State has any objection, it is proposed to adopt this course. 5. It will be observed that no separate scale of awards has been pres cribed for members of the Indian Civil Service. This is a matter to which the Government of India have given very close and detailed consideration. The existing table for the Indian Civil Service in Article 740, Civil Service Kegulations, was originally based mainly on the Warrant of Precedence, and its effect is that on the basis of pay an officer of this Service is always con siderably worse off than an officer or any other Service. Adverse comments have been made from time to time with regard to this differentiation by various authorities, and in several cases during recent years the Secretary of State in Council has made awards in respect of members of the Indian Civil Service in excess of the amounts prescribed by the existing table. After very careful consideration the Government of India have come to the conclusion that there is little or no justiification for this difference in the treatment accorded to Indian Civil Servants and others, and it is for this reason that in the draft rules they have prescribed one common table for all. One possible argument against this course is the fact that it involves a very material improvement in the amount of the awards admissible to Indian Civil Service officers. For instance, the maximum injury gratuity which will be admissible to an Indian Civil Servant in the 18th year of ser vice will be doubled as compared with that now admissible (Rs. 4,000 to Rs. 8,000), in the 23rd year of service it will be more than double (Rs. 6,000 to Rs. 15,000) and between the 24th and 25th years of service it will be increased from Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 15,000. It might well be argued, of course, that the increases involved are the measure, not so much of the degree of liberalisation which is now proposed, as of the inadequacy of the awards for which Indian Civil Servants have been eligible in the past. Again, the proposed liberalisation of the rules is more apparent than real, since, as already remarked above, the Secretary of State in Council has on occasion sanctioned awards in respect of members of the Indian Civil Service in excess of the amounts for which the rules provide. To provide for the possibility that local Governments might feel reluct ant to agree to so material an improvement in the rules, the Government of India prepared an alternative table for officers of the Indian Civil ber- vice which is set out in Enclosure No. 4. It will be seen that this alter native table would have provided a compromise between the treatment now accorded to Indian Civil Servants and that proposed above. Local Govern ments were invited to express their opinions on this question of the awards to be admissible to members of the Indian Civil Service, and they are, with out exception (save in respect of a small point raised by one local ^ 0 J er1 ]- ment) in favour of the application of the common scales set out m the dra t Rules. This improvement should go far to remove the need for reference to the Secretary of State and consequent delays, in cases concerning Indian Civil Servants, and it gives effect to the suggestion m paragraph 4 of the India Office letter, dated the 5th April 1934 with regard to the table m Article 740, Civil Service Regulations. 6 With reference to paragraph 5 of the India Office letter^dated the 5th 4pril 1934, it will be observed that the general rule m Article 74b-A with regard to the holding of a formal enquiry into pecuniary circumstan ces in cases of death has been abandoned, and that such enquiries will be L775FD8 required under the draft rules only in those types of cases which render such an enquiry clearly desirable. The provision in Article 741-A of the Civil Service Regulations has been abandoned, and awards to officers of the class to whom that Article relates will now be on the same scales and based on the same classification of injuries as for other injured officers. Since these draft rules will relate only to services under the rule-making control of the Secretary of State in Council, and the Contributory Provident Fund Eules (India) do not apply to such services, no non-pensionable officers are likely to be affected save those who are subscribers to the State Railway Provident Fund. It is not proposed to include Railway personnel within the scope of these rules, but, instead, to frame separate rules on similar lines with such modifications as may be necessary to suit the conditions of service peculiar to such personnel, and a separate communication on this subject will be made in due course. 7. With regard to paragraph 6 of the India Office letter, dated the 5ih April 1.934, I am to say that the Government of India have carefully con sidered the question of the treatment of military officers serving with fron tier militia units and with military police forces, and they have arrived at the conclusion that on the whole it would be best to retain the existing posi tion whereby such officers are subject to civil rules. Although the duties and conditions of service of these officers are ana logous to those of military officers in military employment the fact remains that they are in civil employment. Difficulties might arise in applying the military criterion of eligibility for an award, and in any case it seems hardly equitable to draw a distinction of the sort between one class of military offi cers in civil employ and others, merely on the ground that the civil duties of the first class are somewhat similar to military duties. Again, the posi tion of this class of officers was fully taken into account when Army Instruction (India), No. 57 of 1934 was framed, and there appears to the Government of India to be no sufficient reason for excluding this particular class of officers now from the general rule that the question of an award in respect of a military officer in civil employment should be considered with reference to the civil rules on the subject. 8. In paragraph 7 of the India Office letter, dated the 5th April 1934 the question of safeguarding the existing rights of officers now in service is mentioned. This might be done by providing that no officer or dependant shall get a smaller award under the new rules than he or she would have done under the old rules, or by allowing all officers in service on the date on which the new rules come into force to elect to be governed by the old or the new rules. The adoption of either alternative would mean that the old rules with all their defects would have to be kept in existence for many years to come, and would thus defeat one of the main purposes of the revision, which is to simplify administration by removing the need for reference to military rules. As the effect of the draft rules will be to liberalise, and not to restrict or reduce, awards, it is not in the opinion of the Government of India necessary to introduce a safeguarding provision of the kind in ques tion. It occurred to them, however, that in order to remove any possible appre hensions it might be desirable to insert a rule to the effect that in no circum stances should a memorial by an officer in service when the rules came into force, praying for the application of the old rules, be withheld. Local Governments were asked to comment on this suggestion and opinion on the matter is divided. Some local Governments consider the rule to be definite ly unnecessary and undesirable, while those in favour express no strong- views in its support.r care; ^. cons ^ era ti 011 tlie Government of India are of the opinion that no safeguarding provision should be inserted in the rules. The objec tions to provisions of the kind discussed in the first part of this paragraph ha^ve already been stated, it is doubtful whether a rule on the lines of that on which local Governments' comments were invited would be of much prac tical value, and the rules have been so framed that it is improbable in the extreme that any officer now in service, or his dependents, will ever be a loser because of the application of the new rules. In the unlikely event of such a contingency arising the matter could be put right by action under rule 8. 9. In connection with the subject matter of the preceding paragraph I am to say that the Government of India carefully considered the question of consulting Associations of Government servants concerned with these rules, and decided that this should not be done. The main reason for the decision is that the object of the revision is merely to make the rules regard- ing injury and family pensions self-contained and more simple than the existing rules. Again, the new draft rules, which in a great measure re present the practice which has been established under the existing rules, not only involve no deliberalisation of those rules but are more liberal in many respects. In the circumstances it appeared to the Government of India that no useful purpose would be served, and that unnecessary delay would be caused, if service Associations were consulted. 10. One of the least satisfactory features of Chapter XXXVIII, Civil Service Regulations, from the point of view of members of the services, is that the making of an award to an officer or to his family is a matter which, in theory at least, is entirely at the discretion of the sanctioning authority. The Government of India have no reason to believe that the absence of mandatory provisions has actually operated to the disadvantage of any officer, since in practice sanctioning authorities have generally exer cised the discretion allowed by the rules in favour of the officer concerned or his family. The fact remains, however, that apprehension has been expressed by members of the Services on this point, and the Government of India therefore propose that the provisions of the new rules should be mandatory in certain respects. It will be observed that the essence of the rules as now drafted is that, for the purpose of deciding whether an award must be made, or whether it is open to the authority concerned to exercise its discretion, officers are divided into three classes. These are; — (1) those who suffer in,jury or are killed or die through violence caused by a terrorist, anarchist or fanatic, (2) those who suffer injury or are killed or die through violence caused by some person other than a terrorist, anarchist or fanatic, or through accident or disease suffered as a result of a special risk and (3) those who suffer injury or are killed or die through an accident or disease suffered as the result of a risk of office. The terms in italics are defined in rule 3 of the draft, and the obiects aimed at m framing the definitions have been to exclude from the operation of the rules all cases which, under the existing rules and the case law which has been built up around them, would not now qualify for awards and to distinguish between the classes of cases in which Government can safelv guarantee awards and those in which they think it expedient to retain dis cretion. The individual definitions are dealt with in detail in the explana tory memorandum enclosed with this letter (Eclosure No. 3). In the case of an officer who' falls into the 'first class mentioned above it is to be obligatory on the local Government to make an award of the maxi mum amounts admissible. This provision gives effect to the decision bv the Secretary of State in Council communicated in the India Office IpffW ivu F.-4116/33 l -Financial, dated the 9th August 1933.The second class covers cases of a kind of which it can safely be said that Government would certainly make an award, but not necessarily of the maximum amount admissible. Awards in such cases are to be mandatory, but the amounts of the awards granted are to be fixed, within prescribed limits by the local Government, subject of course to the consent of the Secre tary of State in Council being obtained whenever it is proposed to grant an amount less than the maximum admissible in accordance with Section 247 (6) of the Government of India Act, 1935. It will be observed that all cases of c 'violence', save those in the first class mentioned above, come within this category, and at first sight this may appear to be a rather wide provision. The definition of 'Violence', how ever, is such as to exclude from the purview of the rules all cases except those in which the act of violence has a definitely official significance. These mandatory provisions are in theory a liberalisation of the existing rules, but they are not really so in practice because, in the types of cases to which they relate, the rules have to all intents and purposes been worked as if they were mandatory, and the Government of India consider that the risk involved in such cases in guaranteeing awards of amounts to be deter mined by sanctioning authorities is negligible. The third class mentioned above includes all cases in which it is clearly desirable that complete discretion, both as to the making of an award and as to its amount, should be retained. In order to provide for any case which technically falls within the mandatory classes mentioned above but in which no award, or an award of an amount less than that to which the recipient is otherwise entitled, is con sidered necessary, draft rule 9 contains a safeguarding clause whereby power is reserved to the Secretary of State in Council to withhold or reduce any award. 11. (1) The amounts of the maximum awards admissible under the draft rules are stated in Schedules I and II and in general, subject to the remarks below, they represent the awards admissible under the existing rules to offi cers other than members of the Indian Civil Service. (a) In the original draft rules sent to all local Governments for opinion, all amounts were expressed in rupees converted from sterling at the rate of U'. (id. per rupee. This expression of the pensions in rupees is consistent with the pension rules in general, and is suitable in view of the number of Indians now in the Services. The rupee figures were rounded in each case to the next higher convenient figure. It was realised that, unless some provision to the contrary was inserted in the rules, this would mean that officers drawing pensions outside coun tries where the rupee is legal tender would get the benefit of the favourable rate of exchange prescribed in Article 934, Civil Service Regulations. On further consideration, the Government of India consider that it would be preferable to remove the amounts of awards under these rules from the oper ation of that article, and they have therefore provided both rupee and sterling amounts, the one being equivalent of the other at the rate of Is. 6d. rounded to the nearest convenient figure, and have prescribed that if the reci pient resides in a country where the rupee is not legal tender the award shall be the sterling amount and otherwise the rupee amount. The rupee figures in the original draft have been approved by local Governments and they have consequently been adopted. The result, of course is that the sterling figures are slightly higher in many cases than the corresponding sterling figures in the military regulations from which they were originally derived. (h) Where the maximum gratuity or pension admissible to an officer or his widow is less than £100 under the existing rules, the corresponding figure in the Schedule has been raised to the rupee equivalent of £100, rounded to Rs. 1,400. The raising of these figures in the manner described eliminates certain anomalies in the matter of the awards admissible to civil officers9 relative to the amounts now admissible to military officers, and the Govern ment of India feel that this amount is the least that should be awarded for the severest degree of disablement to officers of the status of those to whom these draft rules apply. For reasons which have been explained in the sub-para, {a) above, the sterling figure now appears as £105. (c) A table corresponding to part (a) of the table in Article 740, Civil Service Eegulations, was inserted in Schedules I and II of the original draft rules circulated to local Governments. The details were as follows : — Schedule I.—Injury Gratuities and Pensions. — Gratuity. Annual Pension Higher Scale. Annual Pension Lower Scale. Rs. Rs. Rc. Viceroy of India ........ 50,000 Special Special Governor 40,000 Special Special Member of an Executive Council, Chief Commissioner or Chief Justice of a High Court 27,000 5,400 4,700 Judge of a High Court other than a Chief Justice i 15,000 4 ,700 4,000 Schedule II.—Family Gratuities and Pensions. — Widow's Gratuity. Annual Widow's Pension. Rs. Rs. Viceroy of India ........ 27,000 8,000 20,000 6,000 Member of an Executive Council, Chief Commissioner or a Chief Justice of a High Court 17,000 5,000 Judge of a High Court other than a Chief Justice . 13,500 4,000 This was done because it was felt that the new rules should cover all persons to whom the existing rules apply, but it was, of course, realised tnat the inclusion in the rules of any reference to these classes of officials would cause difficulties in the framing of a preamble, since the rules relate primarily to civil servants to whom Section 96B of the Government of India Act applies. On further consideration the Government of India are of opinion that no reference to the officials in question should be made in these rules, and that it would be simpler if they were dealt with by means of an executive order of the Secretary of State in Council applying these rules, and setting out the appropriate scales. I am to suggest that, if the Secretary of btate in Council considers that such a course would be legally feasible, it should be adopted. It is understood that the India Office are inclined to the view that, while executive orders might with advantage be issued in respect of Judges of a High Court, it would be preferable not to do so in respect of the other officials. The Government of India are disposed to think that it would be best to issue orders for all the classes of officials in question, and not merely for High Court Judges. There are obvious advantages in hav ing definite orders of some sort under which action can promptly be taken, should occasion arise. L775FD10 (2) The Government of India have considered the question whether the rates in the Schedules should be modified in respect of new entrants to the services, but as the question of the revision of the pay of certain of the services most concerned has not yet been finally decided, they have not thought it desirable to attempt anything in that direction in these draft rules. . Vi . v , 12. 'Pay' for the purpose of these draft rules is defined in rule 3 (5) in terms of the definition of 'pay' in Fundamental Rule 9 (21). As you are aware, the suggestion was made in 1932 that for the purpose of Chapter XXXVIII-Civil Service Regulations 'pay' should exclude 'special pay' and should be based solely on the substantive pay of the permanent non tenure post on which an officer held a lien, active or suspended, at the time of his injury or death. After careful consideration the Government of India are now of the opinion that this conception of 'pay' for the purpose in view is not justified. It appears to them that in the majority of cases injury or death is the outcome of the duties of the actual post which the officer is holding, including a tenure post, even though he be holding it only in an officiating capacity. For this reason definitions of pay such as that described above, and the one contained in Article 486 of the Civil Service Regulations, seem to be unsuitable. The definition in Fundamental Rule 9 (21) appears to the Government of India to be the most appropriate for the purpose now in view, and they therefore propose that it should be adopted in the revised rules. 13. No provision has been made in the draft rules for consultation with the Public Service Commission prior to the making of an award. The ques tion of such consultation does not, of course, arise so far as mandatory awards are concerned. For the rest, the Government of India will take up in due course the question of preparing draft regulations regarding consul tation with the Public Service Commission on matters relating to pensions in general, and they propose to deal with this matter of injury and family awards at that time. 14. It will be observed that provisions relating to matters of procedure find no place in these rules. A set of Procedure Regulations has been pre pared and a copy is sent herewith (Enclosure No. 2). (An explanatory memorandum relating to these Regulations will be found attached to the memorandum on the main rules which forms Enclosure No. 3). When the Superior Civil Services (Extraordinary Pension) Rules are published the Government of India propose, on the analogy of what was done in the case of the regulations governing procedure for the commutation of pensions, to issue these Regulations for observance in all cases relating to officers under the administrative control of the Governor General in Council or of a Chief Commissioner, and to invite provincial Governments to take similar action in respect of officers under their administrative control. 15. It is proposed to issue these new rules as a publication entirely separate from the other pension rules in the Civil Service Regulations. This course can be justified in theory by the argument that there is really little inherent connection between ordinary service pensions on the one hand and injury and family pensions on the other, and that the two types of pension are based on entirely different concepts. Again, many of the ideas and much of the phraseology in the Civil Service Regulations are becoming out of date, and a new set of rules based on modern ideas would be out of place in that publication. When the general regrouping of existing rules into two separate cate gories of (1) conditions of service, and (2) procedure, is undertaken in the future, the main rules, and the procedure regulations referred to in the preceding paragraph, can be incorporated in such general codes relating to •conditions of service and procedure respectively as may then be issued.11 16. The rules in Chapter XXXVIII of the Civil Service Regulations apply to persons serving in a civil capacity under the Army Department, but as these draft rules will be made under Section 96B, of the Government of India Act they will not apply to such personnel. The question of the treatment to be accorded to such officers is under separate consideration, and it will probably be proposed that these rules should be applied to them by an executive order to be issued by the Secretary of State in Council. A separate communication on the subject will be made in due course. 17. When these rules have been sanctioned the Government of India propose to adopt them, mutatis mutandis, for members of services under the rule-making control of the Governor General in Council and to invite Pro vincial Governments to frame similar rules for their services. 18. The Government of India hope that the Secretary of State in Coun cil will be able to sanction these draft rules as soon as possible.13 Enclosure No. 1. DRAFT RESOLUTION.

Has the Government servant lost an eye or a limb ? . As to second injury (if any). As to third injury (if any). ^ 2. If the answer to (1) is in the negative, is the injury equivalent to the loss of a limb ?. 3. If the answers to (1) and (2) are in the negative, is the injury very severe ? . 4. If the answer to (3) is ' Yes '' , for what total period from the date of injury has the Government servant been or is be likely to be unfit for duty ? 5. If the answers to (1), (2) and (3) are in the negative, is the injury severe? ...... 6- If the answer to (5) is ' Yes '— (a) is the injury likely 1o be permanent ? (6) and, if so, for what total period from the date of the injury has the Government servant been or is he likely to be unfit for duty ? . 7. *If the answer to (2) was ' Yes ' in the first instance— (a) are the effects of the injury still equivalent to the loss of a limb, and, if not, . (6) are they very severe ? . 8. *If the answer to (3) was ' Yes ' in the first instance, are the effects of the injury still very severe ? 9. If the answers to the questions above are in the negative, the injury should be classified here as ' severe ' but not bkely to be ' permanent or ' slight and permanent or in similar terms g| ^^ * For use in the case of subsequent medica' boards in ca c es of renewal of award. Instructions to he observed by the Medical Board 'preparing the report. 1. The medical board before recording their opinion should invariably consult the proceedings of previous medical boards, if any, as also all pre vious medical documents connected with the Government servant brought before them for examination. L775FD26 2. If the injuries be more than one they should be numbered and des cribed separately; and should it be considered that, for instance, though only 'severe' or 'slight' in themselves, they represent together the equi valent of a single 'very severe' injury, such an opinion may be expressed in the columns provided. 3. In answering the questions in the prescribed form the Medical Board will confine itself exclusive to the medical aspect of the case and will care fully discriminate between the Government servant's unsupported state ments and the medical and documentary evidence available. 4. The Board will not express any opinion, either to the Government servant examined, or in their report, as to whether he is entitled to com pensation, or as to the amount of it, nor will it inform the Government ser vant how the injury has been classified.Enclosure No. 3. Explanatory Memorandum on draft Superior Civil Services (Extra ordinary Pension) Rules. Rule 1. —No comments. Rule This takes the place of Article 728 (a) Civil Service Regula tions.

Rule 3, Sub-rule (1). —This is a new rule. The definition would cover the case of an officer injured as the result of the derailment of a locomotive carrying him on inspection duty over a flooded area, but not if the derail ment occurred on an ordinary train journey. In every case of accident as here defined the question as to whether it falls to be dealt with under the rules will depend on whether it is covered either by the definition of a 'special risk' or of a 'risk of office'. Sub-rule {2). —The existing provisions in Chapter XXXVIII, Civil Service Regulations, in respect of disease are in Article 741-A and the note below Article 746-B. Articles 743 and 747 can be ignored for the purposes of these rules. Clause (a) is taken from the note under Article 746-B, Civil Service Regulations, subject to the substitution of the words 'attendance on' for 'the performance of operations on'. The reference to post-mortem exami nations is new. Clause (5).—This provision is new. It seems a reasonable extension of the definition of an 'accident'. Clause (c). —This definition has reference primarily to the class of case now covered by Article 741-A, Civil Service Regulations, but it covers offi cers who die as well as those who are invalided. This seems to the Gov ernment of India to be a logical extension of the existing rule. Again, it appears to the Government of India to be only reasonable that service with a civil or military police force engaged on operations analogous to military operations should, for the purpose of this definition, be classed with service with an actual military force. As in the case of accidents, a case of disease as here defined has to satisfy either the definition of a 'special risk' or a 'risk of office' before it falls to be dealt with under these rules. Sub-rule {3) and Note thereunder. This is new. It seems desirable that officers should have some idea, by means of examples, of the meaning in these rules of the terms 'very severe', 'severe and likely to be perma nent' j etc. Sub-rule {4). —This is new, and its effect is that, subject to rule 5, awards within the provisions of the rules will be made by Provincial Gov ernments in respect of officers serving under them, and by the Governor- General in Council in respect of officers serving under the Government of India and minor Local Governments. Sub-rule (5).—This is new. It is discussed in the letter to which this is an enclosure. Sub-rule (6). —This covers, in the main, risks of the type for which at present Article 746-D provides, other than risks of 'violence'. 'Risks of28 office' 5 are broadly those risks in respect of which it is expedient that Gov ernment should retain in clear terms the right to exercise their discretion in the matter of making awards. The definition excludes common risks of a kind to which a private citizen pursuing his normal vocation at the same time and place would be equally liable. It would exclude, for in stance, cases of officers killed in ordinary accidents to vehicles, or by the accidental discharge of fire-arms. Sub-rule (7).—In the main, this definition covers risks of the kind to- which Articles 746-B and 746-BB relate. The object of this definition and that of what has been termed a 'Risk of Office' is to distinguish between the types of circumstances in which awards should be mandatory and those in which they should be discretionary. If an 'injury' is suffered as the consequence of a 'special risk' then an award must be made. The risk of infection from venereal and septicsemic patients has in the past been treated as an 'extraordinary bodily risk', and as there can be little doubt that in such a case an award would seldom, if ever, be re fused, even if it were discretionary, the Government of India are of the opinion that this risk can suitably be classed as a 'special risk'. Sub-rule (8). —This is new. The definition covers all acts of violence, in any form, suffered by an officer in his official, as distinguished from his private and personal, capacity, and excludes all others, such, for instance, as acts of private revenge. The rule follows the lines on which cases of this type have been decided in the past. Rule 4. —This is meant to cover various provisions in the Civil Service Regulations with which it is not considered necessary to encumber these rules, e.g., Article 351. Rule 5. —This is a new provision which is discussed in the letter to. which this is an enclosure. Rule 6. —This is new. The reasons for the rule are discussed in the letter to which this is an enclosure. Rule 7. —This replaces the provision regarding the interpretation of rules in Article 4, Civil Service Regulations. Rule 8. —This rule reserves complete discretion to the Secretary of State in Council. Rule 9, Sub-rule (i).—This rule provides a general safeguard which is necessary in view of the mandatory character of some of the draft rules. It covers the first part of Article 730, Civil Service Regulations and parts- of Article 746-E, Civil Service Regulations, paragraph 757, Army Regula tions, India, Volume I and paragraph 688 of the Royal Warrant. Sub-rule (^).—This rule covers, the first sentence of Article 746-E- Civil Service Regulations, portions of paragraph 757, Army Regulations, India, Volume I, 1915, and part of the second sentence of paragraph 695 of the Royal Warrant, 1931. The reference to 'pecuniary circumstances' in Article 746-E, Civil Service Regulations, has been omitted as m the revised rules this condition is not of general application, separate provision having been made for it where necessary. Rule 10. This is new. Cases have occurred in the past where diffi culties have arisen over the matter of reports by medical boards. Rule i2.—This is a new rule. It is not necessary to specify a date so far as any disease falling within the definition in clause (c) of rule 3 (2) is concerned, since in such a case invalidment is a pre-condition for the grant of an award, and the award will normally be granted with effect from the date of invalidment. Rule 12.—This is derived from paragraph 750 and the first half of paragraph 763, Army Regulations, India, Volume I, 1915. No such P 1 * 0 ' vision is necessary in respect of cases of disease. In 1916, when the wound .29 and other extraordinary pensions rule were under revision, the Government of India proposed to impose a time limit of 5 years, but the Committee appointed by the India Office thought it unnecessary to specify such a limit, and there is therefore no corresponding provision in Chapter XXXVIIT, Civil Service Regulations. The Government of India consider that a limit of time is necessary now that awards in certain circumstances are to be mandatory. Rule 13. —This takes the place of Article 732, Civil Service Regula tions, so far as injury pensions are concerned, and the second half of para graph 763, Army Regulations, India, Volume I, 1915. Rule 14.—Sub-rule (1).—This is a new rule, and it represents the actual practice followed in the matter in the past. ^ Sub-rule (2).—This represents Article 510-B, Civil Service Regula tions. Rule 15. —These are provisions on the lines of clause (2) in paragraphs. 753, 755 and 757, Army Regulations. India, Volume I. It is obviously desirable that local Governments should be enabled to put an end to annual medical boards in the circumstances stated in the rule. Rule 16. —This represents Article 738, Civil Service Regulations. Rule 17. —This is a redraft of Article 737, Civil Service Regulations, so far as injury pensions are concerned. Article 737, Civil Service Regulations, is so worded that it might be read as covering the commutation of family pensions. It is doubtful whe ther this was intended when the rule was framed, and in practice the rule appears not to have been used in this way. While some local Governments see no harm in allowing the commutation of dependents' pensions at the discretion of the sanctioning authority, others object on various grounds. It is understood that the India Office are not in favour of such a provision, and none has been made in these draft rules. The objections to the pro posal outweigh the arguments in its favour. Rule 18. —The rule as a whole describes the awards which have to be made in the class of cases of injury in which both the making of the award and its amount are mandatory, in accordance with the decision of the Secretary of State in Council, communicated in the India Office letter No. F.-4116-33, Financial, dated the 9th August 1933. Sub-rule (1) is taken from paragraphs 748-749, Army Regulations. India, Volume I. Sub-rule (2) is taken from paragraph 752 and the first two sentences of paragraph 753, Army Regulations, India, Volume I, and also covers the words 'the use of a limb'' in paragraph 748. Sub-rule (3) is taken from paragraph 751, Army Regulations, India. Volume I. It seems desirable to leave the amount of an additional award for more than one injury of the class in question to the discretion of the sanctioning authority. 0$ Sub-rule (4) ; clause (a) is taken from paragraph 754 and clause (6) from paragraph 755, Army Regulations India, Volume I. Sub-rule (5) is new, and is designed to fill an obvious need in the rules. V Minor changes of substance have been made in this rule as compared with the rules in Army Regulations, India, Volume I, in older to xemedy certain obvious defects in those rules in their application to civilians. ^ The Government of India do not consider it necessary to provide that very severe' injuries should also be 'likely to be permanent in Older to qualiiy officers for the awards prescribed for such injuries under this iule, oi undei rules 19 and 20. Rule 19. —This rule deals with awards in the class of cases of injury in which the making of an award is mandatory but the amount can be varied within limits. L775FD30 Sub-rule I is derived from paragraphs 757-758, Army Regulations, India, Volume I. For a case to qualify for an award under this rule it must satisfy the tests imposed in the definition of 'violence' 'accident' and 'disease', and, so far as accidents are concerned, the further test imposed in the second clause of the definition of a 'Special Risk'. Moreover, all awards are subject to the general safeguard in rule 9 (!) as to default, negligence, etc. Minima have been prescribed in order to make the mandatory character of the rule effective. Sub-rule II. —This, so far as air accidents are concerned, is derived from paragraph 759, Army Regulations, India, Volume I. For the rest, the rule provides for the making of awards on the more liberal scale ad missible under rule 18 at the discretion of the Secretary of State in Council in cirQiimstances of a kind in which he has on occasion in the past made awards on the 'in action' scale prescribed in paragraphs 748-749, Army Regulations, India, Volume I. Rule 20. —This rule deals with awards in the class of cases of injury in which the making of an award and its amount are both discretionary. It represents in the main, Articles 746-D and E, Civil Service Regulations, It also links up with clause (^) of rule 3 (2) and is meant to cover the same ground as Article 741-A, Civil Service Regulations, but it provides for awards to officers of the class for whom that article caters on the same scales and based on the same classification of injuries as for other injured officers. No reference has been made in the rule to the pecuniary circum stances of the claimant on the lines of that in Article 746-E. Civil Service Regulations, because it is considered unnecessary, and experience has shown that enquiries on this point are resented. The first proviso, legarding gratuities, is new ; there might be cases where it is considered desirable to make an award of some sort, but not so expensive an award as a pension. Rule 21. —This is taken from the last sentence of paragraph 757. Array Regulations, India, Volume I. Rule 22. This rule represents the more important provisions in para graphs 695-696 of the Royal Warrant, 1931, not covered elsewhere m the draft rules. The time limit imposed is necessary m view of the mandatory provisions in the revised rules, vide comments on draft rule 12. Ru l e 23.—This represents Article 732, Civil Service Regulations, so far as family pensions are concerned, and paragraph 701, Royal Warrant, 1931 • Rule 24.—Clauses (1) and (2) are taken from Article 741 Civil Ser vice Regulations, read with paragraphs 704-707 of the Royal Warrant. The military rule has now been altered to provide that pensions shall payable to girls up to the age of 18 only instead of 2L ior the reasons given in their letter No. 1/F./488/34-Ests., dated the 3rd January 1935. the Government of India are of the opinion that the age limit of 21 years should be retained in these rules. The chief considerations which have in fluenced the Government of India are that, while the present day opportu nities for employment in England may remove any need for differentiation between the sexes in that country, the same cannot be said of conditions in India that nothing whatever has occurred which would lusufy a dehbera- lisatkm of the rule in this respect, and that any such modification would be strongly resented by the services. Local Governments, who were specifically consulted on this point, are unanimously in favour of the retention of the existing rule as regards the age limit for girls. The first proviso to clause (2) is based on the Note under Article 742 (ii) (d). Civil Service Regulations. fl u l e 25. —Although there is nothing on the subject in the Civil Service Regulations or the Royal Warrant, awards in certain circumstances are of31 course subject to modification in the light of an annual review of the pecu niar}' circumstances of the recipient, m accordance with confidential ins tructions on the subject which have been issued from time to time. Draft rule 25 deals with the question of such annual reviews to the extent that they are considered necessary. For the present the Government of India propose that the existing means tests and the, forms prescribed in this con nection should remain in force. Rule 26. —This is derived from paragraph 703 of the Royal Warrant, 1931, and the first sentence of Article 741, Civil Service Regulations. Rule 27. —Covers the same ground in respect of family awards as does rule 18 in respect of injury awards. It is derived from paragraphs 685, 686, 687 and the first part of paragraph 690 of the Royal Warrant, 1931, and the Secretary of State's ruling with regard to awards to the victims of terrorist outrages. Rule 28. —Covers the same ground in respect of family awards as does rule 19 (I) in respect of injury awards. It is derived from para graphs 685, 686 and the first part of paragraph 690 of the Royal Warrant, 1931. It will be observed that no gratuities are admissible under this rule. Whereas under rule 19, the actual amounts to be awarded are discre tionary within prescribed limits, in this rule it is proposed, in accordance with past practice, to provide for the award of fixed amounts. While there are varying degrees of injury to which an award can be related, there are no varying degrees of death. Rule 29, Sub-rule (2).—This sub-rule covers the same ground in res pect of family awards as does rule 20 in respect of injury awards. It covers the grant of awards in the event of the death of an officer as tha result of disease attributable to or aggravated by, service in a civil capacity with a military force, and this, as already remarked m the comments against rule 3 (2) \c), seems to be a logical extension of the existing provi sion in Article 741-A. The reference to gratuities has been inserted m order to provide for cases where it is desired to make an award of some sort but not so expensive an award as a pension. Sub-rule This takes the place of the reference in Article 746-E., Civil Service Regulations, to the pecuniary circumstances of the family. Rule SO. —This rule is a natural sequence to sub-rule II of rule 19 read with rule 20, and it covers the provision in paragraph 688 of the Royal Warrant, 1931. R u l e si. This is a new rule the necessity for which is self-evident. Ride 32 is based on the last two sentences of paragraph 690 of the Roval Warrant, 1931. Provision has been made m rules 27 and 28 tor the mandatory award of children's pensions in certain circumstances but the Government of India do not consider it necessary to provide that the award of education allowances also should be mandatory. The remarks m the last sentence of paragraph 11 (1) (a) of the letter to which this is an enclosure apply here. Rule 33 is taken from paragraphs 711 and 712 of the Royal Warrant, 1931, read with the first sentence of paragraph 6 (viii) of the Secretary of State's Despatch No. 17-Mily., dated the 15th May 1924, and the Secretary of State's ruling with regard to awards in cases of death due to terrorism. A possible objection to the mandatory provisions in this rule is that ,a sanctioning authority could evade its obligation by refusing to be 'satis fied' that the parents are in pecuniary need. This is a position, however, which must be faced. Local Governments, who were consulted on this point do not anticipate that any trouble will result from this feature.Rule 34 is taken from paragraph 713 of the Royal Warrant, 1931. The remarks against Rule 33 about mandatory provisions apply equally here. Rule 35 is taken from Article 739, and part 'A' of Section II of Chap ter XXXVIII, Civil Service Regulations, so far as civil officers who are members of the Services to whom these draft Rules relate, and who are serving in a civil capacity with a military force, are concerned. The words 'serving officially', which appear to be all that is really necessary, have been substituted for the contents of the first and second sentences of Article 739, Civil Service Regulations. The Government of India do not consider it necessary to complicate matters by including a reference on the lines of that in Article 740, Civil Service Regulations, to military rank assigned or assignable by rule in the field. It is most unlikely that any civilians to whom these rules apply will in future serve in a civil capacity with a military force in such circumstances that an award on the basis of military rank assignable in the field under the old rules would be more favourable than an award under the new, and somewhat more liberal rules, and in the unlikely event of such a case arising it could be dealt with under rule 8. It can reasonably be presumed that an officer serving in a civil capacity with a military force will not draw less pay than he would have drawn in his ordinary civil post. It will be observed that the mandatory principle is extended in this rule to awards in cases where injury or death is the result of enemy action, and that, for the rest, provision is made for the same awards as are admis sible in normal circumstances. The last sentence of Article 739, Civil Service Regulations, is covered by draft rule 7. Article 741, Civil Service Regulations, is covered bv draft rules 24 and 26 and Article 741-A. bv clause (c) of sub-rule (2) of rule 3 and rule 20. Articles 742 and 743. Civil Service Regulations, of course, find no place in these rules. Schedules I and II. —The figures in these schedules are derived from those in paragraphs 748, 749 and 757, Army Regulations, India, Volume I, 1915, and paragraphs 685 (read with paragraph 686), 687 and 690 of the Royal Warrant, 1931, subject to modifications which are discussed in the letter to which this memorandum is an enclosure. Schedule III. —These are the 'examples' referred to in the comments on sub-rule (3) of draft rule 3. The list has been compiled by the Director- General, Indian Medical Service. Explanatory memorandum on Draft Procedure Regulations. Regulatioii 1. —This regulation supplements rule 4 of the main rules r and will cover rules such as those in Articles 944, 954 and 972, Civil Service Regulations. Regulation 2. —Under Articles 734 and 735, Civil Service Regulations^ awards in certain types of cases have at present to be reported to the Secre tary of State. The Secretary of State might with advantage be informed, in future of all awards made to officers under his rule-making control or to- their families. Regulation 3. —This takes the place, in respect of injury awards, of Articles 746 (2) and 746-A., Civil Service Regulations. Certain changes have been introduced which do not call for detailed explanation. The provision in Article 746-A., {a) (II) with regard to pecuniary circumstances has been omitted as it seems unnecessary in cases of injury awards. Sub- rule (4) is designed primarily to obviate delay in cases where injury occurs33 in a remote locality. The reference in Article 746 (2) to the report of the audit officer is covered by regulation 5. Regulation 4, takes the place, in respect of family awards, of Article 746 (2) and 746-A., Civil Service Regulations. Here again most of the changes do not call for detailed explanation. No provision is made for the submission of a formal application because a dependent cannot reasonably be expected to be aware of the rules of Government in a matter of this sort. The reference in Article 746-A. {a) (ii) to pecuniary circumstances has been omitted as it is not the intention to institute enquiries on this point in all cases, and provision has been made for such enquiries in the main rules where necessary. Sub-rule (2) has been inserted for the same reason as sub-rule (4) in the preceding regulation. The reference in Article 746 (2) to the report of the audit officer is covered by procedure regulation 5. Regulation 5. —As stated above, this replaces the reference in Article 746 (2) to the report of the audit officer. Regulation 6. —This is a new provision which it seems to the Govern ment of India expedient to include. Regulation 7. —No special form is prescribed in Chapter XXXVIIT of the Civil Service Regulations for a medical board's report, but in practice Army Form A.-45-A. is used for the purpose. The form in this procedure rule is modelled largely on the Army Form, and has been framed in consulta tion with the Director-General, Indian Medical Service. L775FD35 Copy of letter No. E.-605/36, dated London, S. W .-l, the 11th June 1936, from the India Office, to the Secretary to the Government of India, Finance Department. Superior Civil Services {Extraordinary Pension) Rules, In reply to your letter of the 18th January, 1936, F.-5 (2)-R.II/36 f I am directed to inform you that the proposals of the Government of India for the revision of the rules for the grant of extraordinary pensions have been considered by the Secretary of State in Council. He regrets that the Government of India have found insuperable objections to a simplification of those rules on the lines of the rules in the Warrant framed by the Treasury under the Superannuation Act, 1887, applicable to Civil Servants in this ; country, but he is prepared, for the present, to accept their view. 2. As regards the Viceroy, Governors of Provinces and Judges of the High Court provision can, so long as the Government of India Act is in force, be made by executive order. The question as to the manner in which provision should be made for such officials after the new Act comes into force is still under consideration and a further communication will be addressed to the Government of India on the point in due course. 3. A copy of a Resolution in Council making the new rules is enclosed. These rules follow closely the draft proposed by the Government of India, the only amendments of substance being Rules 5, 13 and 23 (2), which have been made in ordei 1 to ensure that cases in which it is proposed to withhold reduce, withdraw or post-date a grant, as well as those in which it is- proposed to grant less than the maximum award, shall receive the approval of the Secretary of State in Council. A note explaining the amendments other than verbal changes made in the draft, is also enclosed. 4. The Secretary of State presumes that under the rules as now ap proved an award would be made in cases where an officer dies from an epi demic disease such as plague or cholera contracted in the course of the dis charge of his duties in an area in which such diseases are prevalent. I am to ask for an assurance on this point. 5. The Civil Service Regulations will require amendment wherever reference is made in other Chapters to Chapter 38 of those Regulations {e.g., in Article 510-B,) and the Government of India will, no doubt, submit proposals for the necessary amendment at a suitable opportunity.

With the introduction of Provincial Autonomy the description of the Government of a Province as a ''Local Government' does not seem appropriate and the word 'Local' before 'Government' has been deleted wherever it appears in the draft. 2. Rule 15 {fJ). —As a number of cases will be examined by the India Office Medical Board it seems desirable that it should be specifically included in this Rule. 3. Rules SI, 22 {2) and 30. —The words 'by a figure not exceeding the maximum amount admissible' have been deleted. The power of the Secre tary of State in Council is not limited to awarding the grant of the maximum specified under the Rules. He may, under Rule 8, give something beyond what the Rules provide. 4. The Procedure Rules have been incorporated in the Resolution as Section V, the schedules being placed at the end of this section.36 F.-605/30. Resolution. In exercivSe of the powers conferred by Sub-Section (2) of Section 96-B of the Government of India Act, and in supersession of the existing rules regulating wound and extraordinary pensions in Chapter XXXVIII of ithe Civil Service Regulations in their application to persons to whom the rules made herewith apply, the Secretary of State, with the concurrence of the majority of votes at a meeting of the Council of India held this 9th day of June 1936, hereby makes the following rules, namely:— Section I.—Preliminary.

General Rules. 4. Nothing in these Rules shall be deemed to derogate from any rules in force for the time being relating to ordinary pensions in so far as such rules are applicable and are not inconsistent with these rules. 5. Notwithstanding anything contained in these rules no decision to withhold, withdraw or reduce an award or to make an award of an amount less than the maximum admissible thereunder shall be made save with the consent of the Secretary of State in Council. 6. The sterling amount of any award under these rules based on the figures in Schedule 1 or 11 shall be paid if the person to whom payment is made is residing on the date of payment in a country where the rupee is not legal tender, and in other cases the rupee amount shall be paid. 7. If the Government is in doubt as to the interpretation of any of these rules, or as to whether a case comes within the purview of these rules, or as to which rule is applicable in a particular case, or in the event of a disagreement on any of these points between the Government and the Auditor-General, the matter shall be referred to the Secretary of State m Council whose decision shall be final. 8.

(2) Wherever in these Rules it is provided that an authority may at its discretion make an award or fix the amount of an award, such discretion shall, subject to any other relevant provisions in these rules, be exercised with reference to the character and service of the Government servant, of the nature of the risk and his conduct in connection therewith and, in the case of an injury award, the severity of the injury and its probable effect on his future life and career. 10. If in any case the Government is satisfied that it is impracticable to obtain the report of a medical board as to the severity of an injury, it may at its discretion accept in lieu thereof the report of any medical practi tioner or other reliable evidence as to the severity of such injury. Section II.— Injury Awards. General Rules. 11. For the purpose of the rules in this section an injury due to disease shall be deemed to have been sustained on the date on which the medical board reports or such earlier date as may be fixed by the Government, due regard being had to such opinion as the medical board may express as to the date from which the Government servant was incapacitated. 12. Any award in respect of an injury due to violence or accident to which a title is otherwise conferred by the rules in this section may with the sanction of the Secretary of State in Council be withheld if the Government servant first applies for an award more than 5 years after the injury was sustained., 13. Notwithstanding anything contained in rules 18, 19 and 20, if, as the result of delay on the part of a Government servant in submitting his application for an injury pension, the first medical report under these rules on an injury, other than an injury due to disease, is completed after the lapse of a year from the date on which the injury was sustained, any pension awarded shall have effect from such date, not being later than the date of the medical board's report, as the Secretary of State in Council may fix. 14.

In respect of matters of procedure, all awards under the Superior Civil Services (Extraordinary Pension) Eules are subject to any procedure rules relating to ordinary pensions for the time being in force, to the extent that such procedure rules are applicable and are not inconsistent with these Regulations. 37. A report, with copies of relevant medical documents, should be submitted to the Secretary of State in respect of every award made under the Superior Civil Services (Extraordinary Pension) Rules. 38. (1) A Government servant who considers that he has suffered injury in circumstances justifying an award under the Superior Civi] Services (Extraordinary Pension) Rules should submit an application forthwith for examination by a medical board, which application should be forwarded through the usual channel to the Government. (2) Even if no application for examination by a medical board is received, the Government, on receiving the report of the injury of an officer should consider whether there is, 'prima facie, a case for an award to such officer and, if it concludes that such a case exists, it should, subject to the provisions of rule 10 of the Superior Civil Services (Extraordinary Pension) Rules, direct that the report of a medical board as to the severity of the injury, in the form prescribed in Rule 7 of these regulations shall be obtained; (3) If the report shows that the injury is not less than very severe, or severe and likely to be permanent, the Government, before making an award, should direct that a formal enquiry into the circumstances in which the injury was sustained shall be held immediately. (4) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-rules (1), (2) and (3) of this rule, if an authority subordinate to the Government is of the opinion that in any particular case undue delay will be caused if the directions of the Government are obtained, such subordinate authority may itself obtain a report as to the severity of the injury and hold a formal enquiry into the circumstances in which injury was sustained. The case should then be reported in full detail to the Government who, at their discretion, may accept the information so supplied as the basis on which the making of an award shall be considered. 39. (1) A Government on receiving the report of the death of a Gov ernment servant should consider whether there is, prima facie, a case Tor an award under the Superior Civil Services (Extraordinary Pension) Rules to the family of the deceased Government servant, and if it concludes that such a case exists, the Government— (i) (a) should obtain a medical report as to his death, or (h) may accept reliable evidence as to the actual occurrence of death if the Government servant lost his life in circumstances such that a medical report cannot be secured, and45 (ii) should direct— (a) that a formal enquiry into the circumstances in which death occurred shall be held immediately, and {b) that evidence as to the relationship to the deceased Govern ment servant of the person or persons to whom it is proposed to make an award shall be taken. (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-rule (1), if an authority subordinate to the Government is of the opinion that in any particular case undue delay will be caused if the directions of the Gov ernment are obtained such subordinate authority may itself obtain a medical report or reliable evidence of death as the case may be, hold a formal enquiry, and take evidence of relationship. The case shall then be reported in full detail to the Government who, at their discretion, may accept the information so supplied as the basis on which the making of an award shall be considered., 40. When a Government has decided that an award under the Superior Civil Services (Extraordinary Pension) Rules must, or may, be made, and under which rule it will fall, the papers, with a statement of the case and of the amount or amounts, which it is proposed to award, in such form as may be prescribed by the Auditor-General should be forwarded to the audit authority for a report as to whether the award is admissible under the Rules and as to the correctness of the amount, or amounts, payable provided that if in any case all the information necessary for the completion of that form cannot, in the opinion of the Government, be obtained without undue delay being caused, the audit authority should furnish a report based on such information as is available. 41. A child's pension shall be paid— (1) if the child is the child of the deceased Government servant, to the widow if alive, unless another person has been appointed legal guardian in which case, and also in the event of the widow's death, it shall be paid to the legal guardian; (2) if the child is the brother or sister of the deceased Government servant, to the legal guardian. 42.

FINANCE DEPARTMENT. Simla, the 8th October 1936. JProm E. T. COATES, E sq ., I.C.S., Joint Secretary to the Government of India, To T he UNDER SECRETARY of STATE for INDIA, Financial Department, India Office, London. Subject :— Superior Civil Services {Extraordinary Pension) Rules. •Sir, I am directed to refer to Mr. Brown's letter No. F.-605/36, dated the 11th June 1936, with which was forwarded a copy of the Resolution passed by the Secretary of State in Council making the Superior Civil Services (Extraordinary Pension) Rules. The Government of India accept the amendments made to the various rules. They would, however, observe that the procedural rules have been incorporated as section V, that is, as statu tory rules. This is not desirable, and the Government of India presume that it was not the intention of the Secretary of State to make the procedure rules statutory, otherwise— (1) the word c 'Extraordinary ' in the heading of section V, the words 'under the Superior Civil Services (Extraordinary Pension) Rules' in Rules 36, 37, 38(1), 39(1) and 40 and the words 'of the Superior Civil Services (Extraordinary Pension) Rules' in Rule 38(2) should have been omitted, (2) the words 'these Regulations' in Rule 36 should have been replaced by the words 'these rules', and (3) the words 'Rule 7 of these regulations' in Rule 38 (2) should have been replaced by the words 'Rule 42'. I am also to point out that in connection with the proposed recodifica tion of service rules with reference to the existing constitutional position, it is proposed to segregate elements of procedure from the substantive provi sions in the rules wherever possible and to re-issue them in their essential character as non-statutory rules, and the assent of the India Office has been obtained to the adoption of this procedure vide Mr. Grist's letter No. F.- 7261 /35, dated the 6th February 1936. It will be seen from paragraph 14 of this Department letter No. F.-5(2)-R. 11/36, dated the 18th January 1936, that the intention of the Government of India was that after the Superior Civil Services (Extraordinary Pension) Rules were published, the Governor General in Council would issue the Procedure Regulations for observance in all cases relating to officers under the administrative control of the Governor General in Council or of a Chief Commissioner, and would invite Provincial Governments to take similar action in respect of officers under their administrative control. In the circumstances explained above, the Government of India suggest that the procedure rules may be separated from the rules of substance. They also suggest that the word 'an' in the first line of clause (3) of Rule 18 should be replaced by the word 'the' and that in Schedule I, in the last column against item 'Rs. 700 but under Rs. 900' the figure '105' should be substituted for '1'. Certain typographical errors in the rules have been -corrected.50 In the last item of Schedule III the deletion by the Secretary of State of the word 'pain' after the word 'permanent' as suggested by the Gov ernment of India, is presumably intentional. 2. As regards the presumption made by the Secretary of State in para graph 4 of the India Office letter, the Government of India are not sure what the intention of the Secretary of State is when he asks for an assu rance as regards the grant of an award in cases where an officer dies from an epidemic disease such as plague or cholera contracted in the course of the dischargee of his duties in an area in which such diseases are prevalent. Under the rules as they stand an award would not be permissible in the class of cases cited by the India Office unless the officer contracts and dies of the disease in an area where such a disease is epidemic and unless— (1) his devotion to duty was responsible for his contracting the disease; (2) the risk of disease was definitely enhanced in kind or degree by the nature, conditions, obligations or incidents of Government. service. The India Office themselves definitely contemplate that awards under the rules should not be made if the risk of disease is one common to human existence in modern conditions in India, and this is in keeping with the. decision in their letter No. F.-5418/29, dated the 22nd October 1929, namely, that no amendments in the Civil Service Regulations should be made which might be interpreted as a departure from the principle that Govern- Dient undertakes no liability in respect of the families of officers who die from a disease to which they are ordinarily liable. I am therefore to bring these facts to the notice of the Secretary of State and to presume that he is not contemplating cases which are not covered by the rules as explained above. 3. As regards the last paragraph of the India Office letter under reference, I am to say that the question will be taken up, in due course,. after the Rules in question have been promulgated. I have the honour to be. S ir, Your most obedient servant,. (Sd.) E. T. COATES, Joint Secretary to the Government of India..II14MI 51 Copy of letter No. 1 H .-5623/36, dated the 13th November 1936, from the India Office, London, to the Secretary to the Government of India, Finance Department. Subject : Superior Civil Services {Extraordinary Pensions) Rules, P ^ eference t0 J 0UJ: letter of the 8th October, 1936, No. F.-5(2)- / ■ J ^ am diiected to say that although it is recognised that there are a mintages in segregating, wherever possible, rules of procedure from rules ot substance, the Secretary of State in Council came to the conclusion that ^ so ar as the Superior Civil Services (Extraordinary Pensions) Rules were ^'cerned it was preferable that the procedure rules should be made by him. Although the bulk of the rules in section V are comparatively unimportant the matters dealt with in Rules 37, 38 (2), 38 (4) and 39 are important and the Secretary of State in Council considers that it is desirable to obviate the possibility of their being amended unfavourably to Service interests by the redeial or by any of the Provincial Governments after the new Government of India Act comes into force. The consequential amendments of section V , the necessity for which it is regretted was overlooked, will be made when a suitable opportunity arises. 2. In the last column of Schedule I the substitution of the figure '1' for the figures '105' against the item 'Rs. 700 but under Rs. 900' is a typ^^pirical error which I am to request may be corrected. 3. As regards the point raised in paragraph 2 of your letter, I am to say that the intention was that an award should be made in a case in which an Officer contracts an epidemic disease such as cholera or plague in conse quence of being ordered on duty to an area in which such disease is preva lent, or where he contracted it in his efforts to relieve it in the course of his discharge of his duties, i.e., where his duties caused him to be in an epidemic area and his devotion to humanitarian service causes him to undertake 'epidemic' work and from that work he contracts the disease. ^ » a i I GIPD—L775FD—10-2-37—4,600.No. 7 of 19,^ ttTTP British Residdticy and Consulate-General, Bushire, the ^ A copy of the undermentioned paper is forwarded to :— . j The Political Agent, Muscat, j The Political Agent, Bahrain,^ The Political Agent, Kuwait, His Majesty's Consul, Bunder Abbas, His Majesty's Consul, Kerman, His Majesty's Vice-Consul, Mohammerah, for information and guidance with reference to this office endorsement No. r, ni , dated the • 19 ^ ^ .
