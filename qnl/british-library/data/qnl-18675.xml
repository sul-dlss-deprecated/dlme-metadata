I have the honor to request you will be pleased to inform the Most Noble the Governor-General, that agreeably with the intention expressed in my letter of the -5th ultimo, the Rear-Admiral Commander-in-Chief hoisted his Flag on board Her Majesty s Steam Sloop ' Rattler,' and, accompained by Her Majesty's Steam Sloop ' Salamander, left Penang on the 28th March. On the 1st April, His Excellency arrived off the mouth of the Rangoon River, where he found lying Her Majesty s Ships ' 1 ox and ' Serpent,' Hon'ble Company's Steamers ' Phlegethon''and ' Proserpine,' three Transports, and the Ship taken from 'ie King of Ava. On the following morning, the Steamers and 1 ransports named in the margin arrived from Calcutta, with the Lieutenant- General Commanding the Forces on board, and the ' Salamander came in shortly after.

Re ceiving Troops on boaixl. there to the number of fifteen hundred, the Squadron proceed5d-off Martaban, and assisted at the capture of that place on the 5th instant, the particulars of which the Commander ot the Forces will have the honor of communicating to His Lordship. The ' Hermes' grounded too far off to be of much use. The ' Salamander,' owing to her draught of water, could not come so near as was desirable: nevertheless, the shelling was most effective. The ' Rattler' took up an admirable position, two hundred and fourteen yards from the Stockades : her shot and shell did much execution. The ' Proserpine,' ad mirably managed by her able Commander (whom His Excellency would beg to bring under favorable notice), received the Troops from the larger Steamers and landed them, and at the same time kept up a constant fire upon the Stockades. The only casualties that occurred in the Squadron were on board the ' Rattler,' where one seaman was wounded in the arm, and two of the Madras Native Infantry. On the 7th instant, eleven hundred European Troops, with Camp-followers, Baggage, See, Steamers were em barked in the Squadron and the r J ransport ' Jessie,' and Feroze, Zenohia sa ^ e ^ ^ or ^ le rendezvous, arriving on the 8th and instant.

Sir ,—In pursuance of the instructions I had received from your Excellency, I proceeded up the Rangoon River on the afternoon of the 4th instant, taking under my orders Her Ma jesty's Sloop ' Serpent,' and the ' Tenasserim ' and ' Phlegethon' Steamers, belonging to the Hon ble East India Company, with three Companies of H. M.'s 18th Regiment under the Command of Lieutenant-Colonel Coote. I anchored off the Bassein Creek the same evening. At day-light, on the morning of the 5th, I again weighed and went up the River, having previously given directions to Commander Luard, with the ' Serpent' and u Phlegethon,' which 1 placed under his orders, with one Company of the 18th Regiment, to attack and des troy the DeSylvia Stockade, which service he most effectually performed. I proceeded myself with the ' Fox' and ' Tenasserim' to the Dunnout, and a new stock ade that had recently been erected nearly opposite on the other side of the River; as we ap proached the Enemy opened an ill-regulated fire on us, two of their shot striking the 'Fox,' which was soon silenced by Her Majesty's Ship and the Steamer. The Troops and the Marines of the ' Fox' were then landed, and by the evening both stockades were burnt, and the whole force re-embarked without any casualty. I have great satisfaction in stating that the energy and good feeling displayed by both services in performing this duty was such as to meet my highest approval; and I have to express my thanks for th^ assistance I received from Lieutenant-Colonel Coote and Com manders larleton and Luard, as well as from the Commanders of the Hon'ble East India Company's Steam Vessels of War 'Tenasserim' and Phlegethon.'

' Rattler,' at Rangoon, \Qth April 1852. Sir, In continuation of my letter of the 9tli instant, reporting, for the information of the Most Noble the Governor General of India, the proceedings of the Naval Squadron employed in these Waters, 1 have the honor further to report, by desire of the Rear Admiral Com mander-in-Chief, that on the 10th instant the Ships, Steamers, and Transports commenced an advance up the River, and anchored below the Hastings' Shoal that evening. The 'Zenobia' had been sent a part of the way up on the day previous, for the purpose of watering, but grounding on the De Sylva's Shoal, was unfortunately unable to get out of her difficulties in time to take a part in the proceedings against Rangoon. A copy of the Rear Admiral's Order to advance is annexed (enclosure No. 1), by which it will be seen that it was intended on the following morning (Easter Sunday) to anchor above the Shoal, but out of the range of fire from the Enemy. I have the honor also to enclose a copy of the General Order for the proceedings of the Sqaudron while oft' Rangoon (enclosure No. 2). Some alteration had, however, to be made in the arrangements proposed. It was found that there would not be room for all the Ships to anchor above the Shoal out of gun-shot, without a risk of their grounding, and it was for some time debated whether the Squadron should remain below the Shoal until Monday, or advance on the Sunday morning to take up their positions off Rangoon, and risk the commencement of the action on that day. The tides and other causes decided the Authorities on adopting the latter course, and accordingly the Shoal was crossed on the morning of the 11th by each Ship as the water served. When the first vessels had anchored above it, the Dagon Pagoda fired several guns, apparently with a view to call in the people. Upon the Hon'ble Company's Steamers ' Feroze,' ' Moozuffer,' and ' Sesostris,' taking up their positions, fire was opened upon them from the Stockades on either side, which was returned with shot and shell. In the course of an hour an explosion took place, the importance of which was only afterwards discovered. It was that of a Stockade mounting nine eighteen-pounder guns, well planted, and would doubtless have done great mischief to our shipping, if not thus accidentally silenc ed so early. Upon the ' Fox' advancing to take up her position, she poured effective broadsides into the Stockades on both sides of the river. After consulting the Lieutenant General Commander of the^Forces, the boats of the ' Fox' landed, with a party of Seamen and Marines, and a Company of the 18th Royal Irish, and, under cover of the Ship's Guns, stormed two Stockades on the Dalla side. Although a rapid fire of musketry was kept up from many hundreds of the Enemy in these defences, yet this service was happily effected with but one man wounded on our side. Her Majesty's Sloop ' Serpent,' and the Hon'ble[ 979 ] Company's Steamer ' Phlegetlion' then pnssed up the river, and anchored above Kem- mendine! in order to capture the War-boats, and to prevent Fire-rafts being sent down upon the Squadron. The 'Rattler' and ' Tenasserim' next advanced along the line, and succeeded in silencing three more Stockades. The party before alluded to, in the boats of the ' Fox,' and a few Seamen, with thirty of the Hoyal Irish from the ' Rattler,' stormed another on the Dalla side, driving hundreds of the Enemy out of it into the jungle. All the Stockades that had been taken were then set fire to, and burnt in succession. The Ships returned to their respective positions in readiness to land the Troops, which commenced at 4 o'clock on the morning of the 12th, without opposition from the enemy. It was discovered that the Dagon Pagoda was not so far from the Ships as was laid down in the Charts, being at a good shelling distance; the Ships accordingly commenced throwing shells into it. In the course of the evening a Magazine blew up, and the outskirts of the Pagoda were set on fire in several directions, creating great confusion among the Enemy. Shells were occasionally thrown from the Ships on the 13th instant during the day and night, frequently setting fire to the Stockades in vari ous places. On the afternoon of that day, a large party of Men, with two elephants and riders, were seen to leave the Pagoda. It was afterwards understood that this was the Governor of Rangoon, who had quitted the Pagoda in despair of being able to hold it. It will be the pleasing duty of the Commander of the Forces to report the advance of the Troops and the gallant storming of the White House Stockade about half a mile from the landing place, and ultimately the storming and capture of the Dagon Pagoda. The Rear-Admiral desires further to observe * Senior Lieut. S. W.

My Lord Marquis, Fort William. , While congratulating your Lordship on the success that has hitherto attended the Expe dition against Burmah, in the Storming and Capture of the strongholds of ' Martaban' and 'Rangoon,' I trust your Lordship will permit me to bring under notice the support that I have received from all the Officers and Men under my Command, forming the Naval part of the Expedition. The embarking arid disembarking the Troops, Baggage, and Military Stores, the arrangements for the Transports and for V ictualling the combined Forces, has fur nished almost incessant night and day work for the Officers and men under my Orders. It has been done on all sides with the utmost cheerfulness; and this large Force has been moved up a rapid river without any accident of moment having occurred, and 1 have, up to the pre sent time, to thank every Officer and M m employed under my Orders for the cheerful manner in which they have undergone so much toil in this distressing climate. f To the Commodore I feel under special obligation. His local knowledge proved valuable, as his judgment and discretion were most useful. It would be impossible to value the ser vices of an Officer, second in command, more highly than I do those of the Commodore. Captain Lynch, Senior Officer of the Indian Navy, has, by his ability, judgment, and discretion, rendered essential service. Commander Mellersh, of my Flag Ship, and Commanders Fishbourne and 1 arleton have | | rendered every possible assistance in carrying out all necessary arrangements. I was an eye-witness to Commander Tarleton's bravely leading his men to storm a Stockade; to his being the first to mount the walls and enter it. Commander Luard, of Her Majesty s Sloop ' Serpent,' has been employed many months in these waters ; a more zealous and indefati^ gable Officer is not to be met with, and, relying upon his ability, he has frequently been placed in charge of responsible duties. AV ith the assistance of the Honorable Company s Steamer ' Phiegethon,' commanded by G. T. Neblett, Esq., he destroyed the De bylvia Stockades. When the action on the 11th April commenced he passed along the line of fire in the Sloop under his Command to above Kemmendine, for the purpose of preventing the removal of the War-hoaU, and while on this service, he wa^ttacked by a very important ^ Stockade, and an Officer (Mr. G. Sproull, Assistant Surgeon,) and seven of his men were wounded, but which he ultimately succeeded in silencing. Before the commencement of the War, he took great pains in surveying the Coast and River, and his information was after wards of great use. The Commanders and Officers of the Indian Navy, and of the Hon'ble Company's Uncovenanted Service have, without a single exception, performed their duties with all pos sible alacrity. Commander Brooking, of the ' Proserpine,' had, at Martaban, an opportu nity of particularly distinguishing himself, of which he took good care to avail himself, and it is with great regret that I found myself under the necessity of leaving him at Moulmein for the protection of British interests, and thus losing his valuable services here. Lieutenant George ^ Rice, in temporary command of the ' Maha Nuddee,' rendered essential service to the cause. Admirably handling his little vessel, he landed men on the beach to storm Stockades, covering their landing with his own guns, and at the storming of them he was to be seen among the foremost ranks. In landing men, stores, and baggage, and ascending the narrow creeks of this river, the ' Maha Nuddee has proved most useful. . Senior Lieutenant J. Durville, of my Flag Ship, commanded the Naval Brigade at the Capture of Rangoon ; and from the flattering manner in which the Commander of the Forces has been pleased to speak of his services, I feel assured he must be honorably mentioned in the Lieutenant-Generars Despatches. Among those that have fallen victims in the service of their Country upon this occasion, it is my painful duty to record that of the Rev. Thomas T. Baker, Chaplain of Her Majesty ^ Ship ' Fox.' Incessantly employed in administering to the wounded and dying, and in burying the dead, he fell a victim to the prevaling epidemic, cholera, on the Ukli instant, leaving, I am imformed, a widow and young family, who were wholly dependent on him for support. 1 was an eye-witness to the indefatigable exertions of Dr. Minter, Surgeon of the ' Fox,' at the Hospital on shore, and on board the ' Tubal Cain.' Dr. Montgomery, Super intending Surgeon, expressed himself to me as being under tfre greatest obligations to him ^ for his assistance. In addition to the duties performed by Dr. Minter at the Hospital, he had those of his own ship to attend to, where the cholera had broken out with some virulence. Mr. Seecombe, Assistant Surgeon, of the 'Hermes/ was also employed'at the Hospital on shore, v &amp; - v .[ 981 ] # In conclusinn, I be» to remark that the whole conduct of the Officers and Men under my • Orders, employed on the present Expedition, has been such as reflects much credit on them selves, and the Services to which they respectively belong. • I have the honor to be, * My Lord Marquis, Your Lordship's Most Obedt,, Humble Servant, (Signed) CHARLES JNO. AUSTEN, Rear Admiral, Commander-in-Chief. No. 1. From Lieutenant General H. GODWIN, c. b., Commanding the Forces in Ava, A rracan, and Tenasserhn, To C. ALLEN, Esquirr, Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, Fort William. Moulmein, 6M April 1852. Sir, I have the honor to acquaint you, for the information of the Most Noble the Go vernor General in Council, that the Force under my command left the Sand Heads on the 20th of March, for the Rangoon River, the place of rendezvous for the combined Force, from Bengal and Madras, where it arrived on the 2nd of April. In obedience to my instructions, a Flag of Truce was immediately sent up to Rangoon, to inquire if any communication had arrived from the Court of Ava, in reply to the terms ^ sent up to the Burmese Government, for the adjustment of the violences committed on the subjects of Her Majesty by the authorities at Rangoon. The Flag was in charge of Captain Latter, of the Bengal Army, and conveyed in the Hon'ble Company's Steamer ' Proserpine,' Commander Brooking. On reaching the stockades that guarded the river on both its banks, the flag was fired on, and it was only by the excellent arrangement and brave conduct of Commander Brooking that his ship extricated herself, inflicting on the enemy a severe chastisement, by blowing- up a powder mag d^u^yiu^ miiny lUejQ, ■ '*■ I found, on my arrival at the rendezvous, that the Madras Division had not made its appearance, nor were there tidings of it, so that I resolved to go to Moulmein, and make arrangements for the capture of Martaban. In the Rangoon river, I found that Rear-Admiral Austen, c. b ., the Naval Commander in Chief, had just arrived from Penang in H. M.'s Steamer ' Rattler.' His Excellency and Commodore Lambert immediately came on board the ' Hermes,' Commander Fishbourne, in which 1 had my Head-Quarters, when it was agreed, in conference, that the Admiral would accompany me to Moulmeiil, with H. M.'s Steamers ' Hermes,' ' Kattler,' and ' Sala mander,' sending in advance to the mouth of the Martaban river theH. C. Steamer 'Proser pine.' We accordingly left the Rangoon river at daybreak on the 3rd April, reached Moul- meiii the next day at noon. Orders were immediately issued for the troops to be in readiness for embarkation by 4 p. m ., and by 9 that evening a wing of H. M.'s 18th R. L, a wing of H. M.'s 80th Regt., a wing of the 26th Madras Native Infantry, with details of Bengal European Artillery, and Madras Sappers, in all about 1,400 men, were on board. Martaban stands on a noble sheet of water, with a river line of defences of about 800 yards. Inland lies a large Pagoda, a wall running along the whole front, with an ascent from the water's edge of about 500 feet, on the top of which small Pagodas stand, the slope being partially covered with fine trees and close jungle. Arrangements were made for the attack at day-break of the 5th. The Rear-Admiral made every disposition possible, in waters full of shoals and violent currmits, for bombarding the position with his five Steamers, and , to cover the landing of the Troops. It was the admiration of every one to witness the noble manner the' Rattler' worked her way to within 200 yards of the wall, and close to the Pagoda, doing tremendous execution. 1 changed from the ' Rattler' at six o'clock to superintend the landing of the Troops, and went on board the ' Proserpine,' a smaller vessel, with my Staff. Colonel Reignolds commanded the attack. At half past 6 the Steamer opened fire, and at 7 the Troops were in the boats, and landed by the indefatigable exertions of Commander Brooking, under a smart fire of musketry and guns. Soon was the storming party under the walls, and over them, with less loss than I thought possible. Lieut. Col. Reign olds immediately ascended to the Pagodas on the height, and took possession of them after some skirmishing with the Enemy. At 8 a. m . Martaban was our own, and considering the Enemy's position and numbers, which report gives at 5,000 men, we have got it very cheaply.[ 982 ] 1 have to ask His Lordship s, and the Council of India's, best consideration of the services of Lieut.-Col. Reig-nolds, ot the 18th R,. L, to whom is due the credit of this day's endurance of severe fatigue and privation under a burning sun. To Captain Gillespie, in command of the Grenadiers of the ISth R. L, whom I saw first on the wall, the soldier following him receiving three wounds, to Captain-Campbell, who com manded the wing of the 18tli R. I., to iMajor Lockhart, in command of the wing of the 80th Foot, to Lieut-Col. Johnston, commanding the wing of the 26th Regt. Madras' Native In fantry, and to Capt. Randall, commanding the Detachment of Madras Sappers and Miners, my warm approbation is due. I beg also to recommend to the consideration of His Lordship in Council, the Assistant Adjutant General of the Force, Captain Mayhew, whose exertions, during the disembarkation of the troops, tended greatly to its success, as also my Aides-de-Camp, Lieut. Chads, of H. M.'s 64th Regt., and Lieut. Lambert, of the 56th Native Infantry, son of the Commodore! who were highly useful to me during the whole day. Major Fraser, the Commanding Engineer of the Force, and Major Turton, in command of the Bengal Artillery, were with me the whole day, but from the nature of the Operations, their particular services were not called into play, though they had made every disposition for the efficiency of their respective departments. It will be obvious from the foregoing how greatly the success of the Operations I have detailed has depended on the co-operation of the sister branch of the Service. His Excellency, Rear-Admiral Austen, c. b ., has throughout afforded me the most cordial assistance. Her Majesty's Steamers 44 Rattler,'' ' Hermes,' and ' Salamander,' worked in concert with the Troops throughout the day. On my departure to-morrow, I intend to take with me to the Rangoon River the wings of the 18th and 80th Regiments, and the companv of Bengal Artillery, and the detachments of Mad ras Sappers and Miners, doing duty at Moulmein. In conjunction with Lieutenant-Colonel Bogle, the Commissioner of these Provinces, I have put the 26th Madras Native Infantry, and a Company of European Madras Artillery,'with a suitable Battery of Guns, as a Garrison at Martaban, relievable from Moulmein, when it may be thought desirable. . In addition to which a War Steamer has been placed by the Naval Commander in Chief on the Station. These arrangements are, 1 think, adequate to the protection of the place, and will, 1 trust, meet with the approbation of the Government of India. In conclusion, I beg to remark that I am greatly indebted to Lieutenant-Colonel Bogle, who accompanied me during the whole of the operations of the 5th, and was, from his local knowledge, of much use to me.

On my return from Martaban on the 8tli of April, I had the satisfaction to find the Madras Division had arrived on the previous day, so that no time had been lost by my going to Martaban. It was arranged that during my absence at Moulmein, Commodore Lambert should, on the 5th instant, aided by some Troops, destroy the Stockades on the Rangoon River, which had long been troublesome, and had fired on the ' Flag of Truce.' This had been so effec tually performed, as to leave hardly a sign of where the Stockades had stood. I shall now have the satisfaction of acquainting you, for the information of the Most Noble the Governor General in Council, of the proceedings of this Force, inclusive of the Capture of the great Dagon Pagoda at Rangoon, and the consequent fall of all around it. The 9th of April I devoted to making every disposition for the landing of the Troops, and to becoming acquainted with the Heads of Departments of the Madras Division. I informed the Admiral on the evening of that day that my preparations were complete, and His Excellency proceeded up the River the next day, close off Rangoon. On the 11th, the Admiral moved opposite the old Town, with the intention the next morning to bombard the whole line of Stockades on both banks of the River; but some of the Flotilla, getting very near the shore, were fired on, which brought on a return from our side, and ended in the general de struction of the whole line of Defences, though the fire of the Enemy proved fatal to many on board the Shipping. The Admiral and Commodore took a most distinguished part in the operations, landing and setting fire to all around them, ihis powerful attack, from the Steam Frigates of both Her Majesty's and the Hon'ble Company's Navy, completely cleared the ground for nearly a mile for our landing. On Monday, the 12th, at daybreak, the Troops were .ready, and by about 7 a. m . I had landed Her Majesty's 51st Light Infantry, the 18th Royal Irish, the 46th Bengal Native Infantry, and part of my Artillery. The Bengal Guns, under Major Reid, were ordered to move in advance, covered by four Companies of the 51st Light Infantry. They had not proceeded far, however, when on opening some rising ground to our right, Guns opened on us, and shortly after skirmishers showed themselves in the Jungle. This was a new mode of fighting with the Burmese, no instance having occurred last War of their attacking our flanks, or leaving their Stockades, that I remember ever to have taken place. I make this remark as they are now not only good shots, but bold in their operations, and clever in selecting their ground and covering themselves. Our casualties for the past three days will prove it, our dress exposing us, and their garb and colour concealing them. 3[ 984 ] \ On looking at the Stockade whence the fire came, 1 perceived it was a strong work, which used to be called in the last War the ' White House' Picquet, a very strong position, and just in the way of our advance. A Battery of four Guns was immediately opened on it by Majors Reid and Oakes, the whole being under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Foord, Commandant of that arm. The fire of these Guns was very effective. A storming party was formed of four Companies of the 51st Light Infantry, under Lieutenant-Colonel St. Maur, with the Madras Sappers under Major H. Fraser, Commanding Engineer, and advanced under cover of a Jungle; on getting through which, the Musketry was so steady and effective from the Stockades and adjoining buildings, that a great many of our party were killed and wounded, amongst whom were several Officers. I have to deplore the temporary loss of Lieutenant-Colonel Bogle, the Commissioner of the Tenasserim Provinces, who was very bravely attending the Army to witness its operation. Major Fraser took the Ladders to the Stockade most gallantly, and alone mounted the defences of the Enemy, where his example soon brought around him the storming party, which carried the Stockade, but at a very severe loss on our part. It was my intention to move on to the main object of our operations; but on looking around me at the complete exhaustion of the storming party, it now being 11 o'clock, under a sun that may be understood, since Major Oakes, of the Madras Artillery, was struck down by it, at his Battery, and died; Brevet Major Griffith, Madras Army, whilst conveying an order, died on the road. Lieutenant-Colonel Foord, Commandant of Artillery, was nearly a victim to the heat, and obliged to quit the field. Brigadier Warren and Lieutenant-Colonel St. Maur also suffered greatly : so that, under such destruction, I resolved to halt where I was, and concentrate the Force in as strong a position as the country admitted of. We were teazed by parties of the Enemy hovering around us till the night closed, when all was quiet-/ under the protection of our Guns, which had been brought up to the front. On Tuesday, the 13th, it was reported the heavy Battery Guns could not be landed, and'' with me, before the middle of that day; and also that rations for the Troops could not be prepared in time to enable me to advance. I therefore held my position till the next morning. His Lordship in Council knows well the spot where 1 proposed to force my way into the Great Pagoda; and the road I was about to move on entirely turned all the defences of this real stronghold. The present position of Rangoon is entirely altered since the last War ; within a few years, the oIcTTown, which stood ou the River bank, has been utterly destroyed, its bricks now lying in heaps on its site. A new Town has been formed about a mile and quarter from the River, it is nearly a square, with a bund or mud-wall about sixteen feet high and eight broad ; a ditch runs, along each side of the square, and on the North side, where the Pagoda stands, it has been very cleverly worked into the defences, to which it forms a sort of Citadel. The distance from the Pagoda to the South entrance of the Town is about f of a mile, and it is something more than that breadth from East to West. The old road from the River to the Pagoda, comes up to the South Gate, running through the new Town, and it was by this road the Burmese had settled that we should attack it,—and where they had made every preparation to receive us, having armed the defences with nearly a hundred pieces of Cannon, and other missiles, and with a Garrison of at least ten thousand men. The attempt to assault on this side would, I am convinced, from the steady way the Burmese defend their works, have cost us half our Force. On Wednesday, the 14th, the Troops were under arms at 5 a. m ., all in as fine a temper as ever men were. Our march was to the North-west, through thick Jungle, four light Guns, 9 pr., their flanks protected by 2 Companies of H. M.'s 80th Regiment, the rest of the Wing of that Corps following with two more Guns, and the 18th Royal Irish and the 40th B. N. 1. formed the advance. The 51st L. 1. and the 35.th M. N. I. were in reserve, the 9th M. N. I. keeping open the communication with the Shipping. We proceeded in this order for about a mile, when we opened the Great Pagoda, and its fire was turned on us. An excellent position for two guns was taken by Major Turton, to our left flank—these were left under the command of Major Montgomerie, of the Madras Artillery, who served them ^ w r ell. The ground to the front getting very difficult, barely admitted of the 80th and Ro3 r al Irish occupying it in close order. We had now completely tlirned the Enemy's position, having passed their Stockaded Town, and got opposite the East side of the Great Pagoda— our main object. Major Turton informed me that he had a favourable position to place in Battery his heavy Guns ; but it took some time to bring them up—a service in which the Navy Brigade, of about-120 men, under the command of Lieutenant Dorville, of H. M.'s Frigate ' Fox,' assisted by the Artillery, rendered their invaluable aid, under a heavy fire of Guns and Wall-pieces from the Great Pagoda and Town, from which they suffered severely : whilst this was going on, the Enemy's Artillery had got the range of our crowded position, and their Skirmishers had somewhat closed on us, and it took 500 men to keep down their fire. The practice of the heavy Battery, under Major Back, was very effective. My intention was to have stormed the Pagoda at noon ; but at a little after 11, Capt. Latter, of the Bengal Army,# [ 985 ] my Interpreter, assured me he felt confident, from what he could see of the East entrance ol the Pagoda, on which our Battery was playing, that the entrance was clear, and that he was prepared to show the way. As our people were dropping fast where we stood, I determined on an immediate assault. The storming party was formed of the Wing of H. M.'s 80th Regiment, under Major Lockhart, two Companies of the Royal Irish, under Lieutenant Hewitt, and of two Companies of the 40th B. N. I., under Lieutenant White, the whole commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Coote, of the 18th R. I.—Captain Latter accompanying the party to show the road. The advance to the East entrance of the Pagoda was of about 800 yards, which the Troops crossed in a most steady manner, under the fire of the walls crowded with the enemy, the remainder of the Force following closely. When the storming party reached the steps, a tremendous rush was made to the upper terrace, and a deafening cheer told that the Pagoda no longer belonged to the Burmese. The Enemy ran in confusion from the Southern and Western Gates, where they were met by fire of the Steamers. All the country around has fallen with the Pagoda, and, I understand, the once strong post of Kemmendine has been abandoned and destroyed. In this united service, there has been not only a cordial co-operation between the Army and Navy, but so much good-heartedness, that their joint efforts have tended to secure the rapid success of this expedition. I cannot presume to say of Rear Admiral Austen, C. B., Commanding the Navy, more than to express my admiration and respect for his qualities, and to thank him for his able and never-failing assistance. Commodore Lambert, whose spirit never is at rest whilst anything is to be done, and whose heart is ever ready to accom plish what he undertakes, has my cordial thanks and warmest gratitude. I particularly wish to draw the attention of His Lordship in Council to Commander Fishbourne, of H. M.'s Bteamer ' Hermes,' who, from the first fitting out of the Expedition in Calcutta to the close of these operations, has been indefatigable in assisting in the embarkation of Stores and Troops, and in removing difficulties, and finding resources, which alone enabled the Expedition to sail at the time appointed ; and nothing will give me such satisfaction as his aid, were a forward movement to be made hereafter. My most difficult task now commences—that of recommending to the protection of the Governor General in Council a number of brave men, who have had opportunities of dis tinguishing themee^ves iir a sew/iee the utmost emulation -and gallant devotion were shown by all. I beg the Most Noble the Governor General's consideration of the services of Brigadier Elliott, wjio was conspicuous in every place where he could be useful; of Lieutenant-Colonel Reignold, who commands the Bengal Brigade, in consequence of Brigadier Warren's pros tration by the sun, and who has borne a very large share in these operations, including Martaban; of Lieutenant-Colonel Coote, of the 18th R. L, who commanded the storming party, when he was severely wounded; of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomson, Commanding the 40th Bengal N. L, in the assault; of Major Lockhart, Commanding the Wing of H. M.'s 80th, on the same occasion ; of Major Eraser, Commanding Engineer of the Force, who not only distinguished himself most gallantly at the 'White House' Stockade, but whose indefatigable exertions have never for a moment ceased ; of Major Turton, who commanded the Artillery, after Lieutenant -Colonel Foord's retirement from illness, and whose labours in his depart ment have been the cause of his suffering, I regret to say, under severe indisposition at the present moment; of Majors Reid, ol the Bengal, and Montgomerie,.of the Madras, Artillery ; of Captain Rundall, Commanding the Sappers and Miners,—to all of whom I am deeply indebted. The Assistant Adjutant General of the Force, Captain Mayhew, was everywhere present, during these three days' operations ; and the assistance he has rendered me on all occasions has been very valuable. Major Allan, the Assistant Quarter Master General, was severely wounded at the ' White House' Stockade, since when Major Boulderson, my Deputy Judge 'Advocate General, has been performing his duties, and has rendered essential assistance since the operations commenced. I beg to bring all three to the notice of Government. The Officers Commanding Brigades have recommended to my notice the valuable aid they have received from their respective Brigade Majors—Captain Call, of the 18th R. L, and Captain Smith, of the 13th M. N. I.; and Major Turton has brought to my attention the indefatigable exertions of Lieutenant Robertson, the Deputy Commissary of Ordnance, in landing his Guns and Stores. I beg leave to bring to His Lordship's notice the assistance I have received from my Aides- de-Camp Lieutenant Chads, of H. M.'s 64th Regiment, who was wounded at the 'White House ' Stockade, but did not leave me during the operations, and Lieutenant Lambert, of the 56th N. L, who, after great exertion, was one of the victims to the sun on that day, which obliges him to return to Calcutta, and who will convey these Despatches.—v [ 986 ] In conclusion, I regret that the order of the landing of the Troops did not a fiord me an opportunity ofavailing myself ofthe services of the 9th M. I. and 35th M. N. I., in the front, but they tended greatly to give freedom to my leading column, and will, from their soldierly bearing, doubtless do honor to the distinguished Service to which they belong, when they are brought more closely under fire. I have the honor to be, &amp;C., (Signed) HENRA GODWIN, Lieut.-Geneval, Commanding the Forces in Ava, Arracan, and Tenasserim. Head Quarters^ Rangoon, \Sth April 1852.
