If this is done, I consider that Captain T. Hickinhotham of the Indian Political Department is the only Indian Service office besides Major Sinclair who is of suitable seniority an well qualified by personal experience for the post. Captain Hickinbotham has already been Civil Secretary from February 1934 to September 1935, and he is there fore familiar with the work, knows Aden well, and is very popular with the local people. I understand that he will be available in the near future to come to .den, and I accordingly recommend his appointment as Givil Secretary for a period of two years. 3.

It is now agreed, however, that we shall pay the appropriate leave contribution and passage contribu tion but the former must, we feel, be based not on Sinclair s Indian pay but on the pay actually borne on United Kingdom funds, i.e. £538.2.6.,(see the statement attached to Colonial Office letter 78065/35 of 30 November, 1935).

Passage contribution: Rs.50 per month, for period 5 February to 15 September, 1935 and will adjust with the India Office on hearing that you agree with that basis.

Sir Bernard Reilly’s leave of absence from Aden was sanctioned for four months up to the 26th September, He has now asked on medical grounds for permission to delay his return to Aden until October (P.

Sir B.Reilly has secured a passage by the steamer arriving at Aden on the 25th October. It is therefore submitted that an extension of leave up to the 24th October should be sanctioned.

War ley, Weeke, Winchester. My dear Cowell, 28th July, 1936. I forget whether I mentioned to you that on my way to -England this year I developed some boils on my head, a result, I think, of the severe heat before I left Aden. I v 7 as given treatment for them on my return home to Wincnester, and they soon disappeared. Lately, however, I have nad a slight return of them. My doctor here thinks that this will soon pass, but at the same time he strongly recommends that, if possible, I should not go back to Aden until October, in order to avoid the heat of September (which is one of the worst months at Aden), and to give more time for tne elimination of toxins from my system. To follow his advice I must find out, firstly, whether the Colonial Office and the Government of India will agree to my extending my leave by a month, and, secondly, whether I can secure a passage to Aden in October, in which month outward bound ships are very full. I am writing to you about the first part of my problem. Do you think that there will be any objection to this extension of my leave? If you think that the way willwill be clear officially, I shall try to book a berth, a matter in which I must act quickly to have any chance of _success. The only man on my staff who is due for leave this autumn is Seager. He will be able to go when Ingrams returns to Aden, and when he has been to Sana. I do not think that an extension of my leave is likely to cause any difficulty at Aden.

From Lieut-Colonel Sir Bernard Reilly, K.C.M.G.,C.I.E.,0.B.E Chief Commissioner, Aden. To The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, New Delhi. Subject:- Application for leave from Lieut-Colonel leave of absence from Aden in connection with the proposal that I should be in England this summer for the discussion of details connected with the impending transfer of Aden to the Colonial Office, that a part of the time - about a month or six weeks - should be on deputation, and I therefore request that has been arrived at on that question. 2. I recommend that Lieut-Colonel M.C. Lake, Political Secretary, be appointed to act as Chief Commissioner, Resident and Commander-in-Chief during my absence, and that Captain M.C. Sinclair be appointed to act as Political Secretary in accordance with the Sir Bernard Reilly, K.C.M.G., C.I.E., O.B.E., Chief Commissioner, Resident and Commander-in- Chief, and consequent acting arrangements. Sir, I have the honour to apply for four months from the of June 1936 It has been suggested the nature of my leave be decided after a decision conventionconvention suggested in paragraph 5 of the Government of India (Air Mail) letter ho# D-5802-E/31 dated 15th February 1932 to the India Office, and approved by the Colonial Office in their letter No* 97863/32 dated 25th July 1932. 3. This arrangement will necessitate the appointment of a Civil Secretary, and I request there fore that a suitable officer be sent to Aden to relieve Captain Sinclair during the period of his acting appointment. 4. If no officer can be sent from India to act as Civil Secretary, I recommend that Captain B.W. Seager, Frontier Officer, whose headquarters are in Aden, be appointed to act as Political Secretary pending the return of Mr. W.H. Ingrams, the First Political Officer from leave in August, and that there after Mr. Ingrams should act as Political Secretary until my return, Captain Sinclair remaining in his post as Civil Secretary. 5. A formal application for leave is being forwarded through the Accountant General, Bombay. 6. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Colonial Office.

P.Z. 1990/36. lOLITIOAL Department. 4424 5000 1/36 The Government of India have raised the question of Captain Sinclair's pay for the period during vtfiich he was employed at Aden last year (5th February to the 15th September). They presume that H.M.G. will agree to oi\ account flL ftaS pCJvaA - contribute during %h-iP -poriod 1 (b) towards passage contribution at Rs. 50 per mensem. (2) a sum of Rs. 67/8/- drawn by Sinclair as travelling allowance on account of his tour in the Protectorate. 2. Captain Sinclair is a member of the Indian Political Department, who came to Aden to act as Political Secretary vice Colonel Lake, whilst the latter was acting as Resident during the absence of Sir Bernard Reilly. During the first 2£ months of his time in Aden, Captain Sinclair understudied Colonel Lake, while during the remainder of the time he actually filled the post of Political Secretary. The problem of the incidence of his pay while in Aden gave rise to much interdepartmental discussion. But eventually agreement was reached with the Colonial Office on the lines set out in the Colonial Office letter of the 12th September on P.L. 6456/35. By this settlement, h.M.G. were to pay at the rate of: - (1) £900 per annum Salary (less economy cut of 3^ up to the 30th June): this sum being the equivalent of the emolument paid to a Colonial Service Officer. (2) £100 per annum duty allowance. (3) £100 per annum pension contribution. (4) £90 per annum conveyance allowance. Of/ sOf these four sums, (1), (2) and (3) were adjusted between Office our A.Gr. Department and the Colonial/Accounts Branch 9231/35). The conveyance allowance (4) was paid locally from United Kingdom funds. These four items represented the total contribution that the Colonial Office were prepared to make on behalf of H.M.G. towards the cost of Captain Sinclair’s employment at Aden. In paragraph 4 of their letter, the Colonial Office stipulated that they should not be asked to pay either (a) for Captain Sinclair’ passage to Aden or (b) for his normal Indian emoluments in excess of the emoluments referred to above. 3. The Government of India were not specifically consulted as regards this settlement, for the reason that Captain Sinclair’s case was held to be covered by the agreement reached in 1932 regarding the U.K. contribution towards the emoluments of a Political Secretary. (Vide Colonial Office letter of 25th July 1932 at P.Z. 4472/32, India Office letter of 27th October 1932 at P.Z. 5229/32 ard Government of India letter of 1st December 1932 at P.Z.7641/32) It will be seen from these papers that the Government of India in 1932 accepted the reservation contained in paragraph I of the Colonial Office letter of 25th July - namely, that if the incumbent of the post of Political Secretary is drawn from the Indian Service, no more will be paid from U.K. funds than the present scale of emoluments for a Colonial Service Officer. 4. The items now put forward by the Government of Indj|a do not appear to have entered into previous correspondence. In view, however, of the agreement definitely reached in 1932 and of the stipulation contained in paragraph 4 of the Colonial Office letter of the 12th September 1935, it appears doubtful whether anything would be gained by pressing the Government of India’s claims.

While he holds charge of that office he has to attend to all the criminal work in exercise of his jurisdiction in the Court of Sessions and to the routine work of the office of the District Court. He is also appointed to hold charge of the various offices, namely, Inspector-General of Registration, Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and ^ferriages.

With reference to your letter 50.3421, dated the 18th May 1935, I am directed to invite your attention to Supplementary Rule 26 4(b) under which a District and Sessions Judge cannot be regarded as serving in a vacation Department. It is not therefore clear under what rule Mr. Davies w$s granted ’♦leave of absence during the court vacation H . The Government of India would, therefore, be glad to have fuller details of the vacation and to jtnow whether the leave of absence of .Mr. Davies has been treated as ordinary leave under the fundamental Rules. On the facte before them, it appears to the Government of India that the permission granted to Mr. Davies to avail himself of the Court 1 s vacation, is irregular and the proposals submitted for the payment of a special pay to Captain Hickinbotham for performing some of Mr. Davi es* duties do not also appear to be in order. 2. I am further directed to observe that Captain Hickinbotham is already an Additional Sessions Judge and if the District and Sessions Court has a regular vacation, Me had only to attend to urge&amp;t sessions work and some of the routine duties of the District and Sessions Judge. The other duties performed by him namely- a - namely those of the Inspector-General of Registration, Registrap-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, District Registrar etc* could not presumably he heavy. In the circumstances I am to request that the Government of India may he furnished with the fuller justification for the proposed grant of a special pay of Rs. 200/- per mensem* I am also to enquire how the work was arranged for during previous vacations.Copy of letter No,5899, dated the Residency, Aden, the 24th August 1935, from the Acting Chief Commissioner, Aden, to the Secretary to the. Government pf India, Foreign and political Department, Sirala. &amp;Abjecti- Proposed grant of special pay to Captain T, Hickinbotham, Civil secretary, Aden, for the perioi during which he held charge of the post of District and Sessions Judge, Aden, in addition to his own. With reference to the Government of India letter No.F.225-N/35, dated the 9th July 1935, I have the honour to state that the annual vacation of the Civil Courts in Aden was sanctioned by the Chief Commissioner under Section 53 of the Aden Civil and Criminal Justice Regulation from 14th May to 3rd July 1935. Mr. Davies had applied for permission to be absent from Aden during the Court vacation and this permission was granted under this office Notification No.3158, dated the 9th May 1935, This was in accordance with previous custom for Mr. Lawrence had been granted permission to prefix to leave granted to him the vacation of the Aden Court from 21st Ifoy 1931 to date of his relief - vide Bombay Government, Home Department, Notification No.8690/2, dated the 25th March 19 31 and in the case of Mr. Weston who proceeded or on one months leave on average pay on the 18th August 19 33 and was permitted to prefix to his leave the Court vacation from 7th July to 17th August 19 33. The leave of absence has not been treated as ordinary leave under Fundamental Rules but as permission to be absent from the station. In the same way that in the case of Mr. Davies* predecessor he was granted permission to be absent from Aden during the vacation. ThereThere jrould appear to fca no reason for any -s distinction being drawn between s.n officer being permit ted to enjoy his vacation in the United Kingdom and so officer being permitted to affix his vacation to a period of privilege leave. 2. During the absence of Mr.. Weston on leave the duties performed by him were divided up among tne officers present while on this occasion tney were not so divided and Captain Hi ckinbotham was appointed Inspector-General of Registration, Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, District Registrar, and Commissioner for Workmen’s Compensation. on the transfer of Mr. Weston to India, Captain Hickinbotham had been appointed an Additional Sessions Judge during the period between Mr. Weston’s departure and Mr. Davies’ arrival and Captain Hickinbotham’s appointment was not automatically cancelled on the arrival of the District and Sessions Judge becuase the Sessions Judge himself was interested in a case ana there would probably be an appeal wnich he would not be in a position to hear. This appointment of Additional Sessions Judge is not in any way connected with the duties of Civil secretary and except for the above stated fact, it would have been unnecessary for the officer concerned to remain Addition al Sessions Judge on Mr. Davies’ arrival. In addition to tnese extra duties this officer is already performing the duties of Collector of Customs, Salt and Excise during the absence on leave of the Extra Assistant Commissioner and receives no additional allowance. The Courts are six miles away and certain appeals and seversl Workmen’s Compensation cases had to be heard in addition to . •..3 to the ordinary routine work and it was tharei'ore recommended try me in my letter No»3421» dated the JBth May 19 35* that remuneration ohould be given for the additional extra work which this officer haa carried out,^.^.225-11/35 i'rom I'he Additional Deputy Secretary to tJde OoverniLent of India in the foreign and Political Department, To The Chief CoiamiBsioner, Aden* hew Delhi, the Octocer 1^35* Iropoaed grant of special pay to Captain jl» hi ck in both a® for the period during wrnich he held charge of the post of District and Sessions Judge, Aden, in addition to his own. Sir, V.ith reference to the correspondence ending with your letter Ho, 5899, dated the 24 th August 19 35, I aiL directed to inform you that while no objection could be raisod to Mr. Davies having left the station during his vacation, the Government of India do not consider they are under any obligation to meet any ot 4..vi .ional expense on account of ln.8 having done so.

Sinclair's emoluments while officiating Camac's precedent can hardly he accepted as it ignores Colonial Office agreement conveyed in their letter to the Treasury No.97863/32 august 22nd 1932 to grant the local duty allowance to married Indian service officers (lide India Office letter No.P.z*.5229/32 dated 27th October 19 32). It is accordingly suggested that the \ Treasury should he asked to reconsider the matter and agree to the grant to Sinclair in addition to the emoluments mentioned by Colonial Office the local duty allowance of £ 100 per annum. In view of the agreement referred to - A appears possible to challenge the view that the allowance was a personal one to a particular officer only. Moreover even if (vide Treasury letter to Colonial office No. 3. 29699 dated 3rd March 1934) it was given to Champion for/ (ty^sirjmrtiTni)l‘or personal reasons that grant was subsequent to the agreement and cannot invalidate it and the same allowance has now been drawn by Lake. The Civil Secretary who is Junior to the Political Secretary receives a compenScitory allov»ance of Es.100 p.m. and it is only fair that Sinclair should be granted an equivalent allowance. Should be grateful for a reply by telegram. The issue of the above has been authorised.

It is to be hoped that this is the final liquidation of this question which has been going on for some weeks* The original proposals of the Colonial Office - P.Z.1014/35 were not entirely acceptable and after some discussion we put forward the proposals at P.Z. 1124/35 which it was thought would be accepted. There have, however, been various misunderstandings - see Colonial Office letter of 21st May. Firstly, it had been hoped that the Colonial Office would agree to pay the whole of Captain Sinclair*s salary whilst he was understudying Col. Lake. This they are not prepared to do and are only willing to contribute at the same rate as during the period when he is acting Political Secretary. The various arguments for and against have already been advanced on several occasions and in order to settle the question once and for all it seems best to accept the arrangement proposed by the Colonial Office. Secondly, there is the question of who is to act as Political Secretary when Col. Lake goes on leave in September. We had thought that Captain Sinclair would continue to hold the post but the Colonial Office pointed out that at that rate the three senior officers at Aden would all be Indian Political officers. They therefore propose that Ing lis should act as Political Secretary and that Sinclair should succeed Hickinbotham as Civil Secretary, which is conceivably the Government of India*s ,.x * intention. At any rate the Government of India have been consulted on this point - see Laithwaite»s letter to Metcalfe below. As regards emoluments which Sinclair will actuallyreceiye, the Colonial Office presumption is correct, though of course Sinclair will only receive the conveyance allowance whilst he is acting Political Secretary, The financial adjustments have been arranged by Mr, James with the Colonial Office Accounts Branch - see his note below. It seems to be the best arrangement for India to continue to pay Sinclair and for us to claim the Colonial Office contributions^, l&gt;ee&amp;u*e Tfhe £100 duty allowance which the Colonial Office have agreed to pay was to go direct to Government revenues and not to Captain Sinclair^ Conceivably the Colonial Office might pay the conveyance allowance direct to Captain Sinclair and I will talk to Mr. Ja^es about this when Treasury concurrence has been obtained for the whole scheme. tJ-- id . l^e tiro ad principle on *nlcn m nave tried to *ortc in Uia past das been that the iteaidsnt ana the Political Secrettiry should not, as a rule, be round iron, the sate .service, ana in so Xar as India are directly ictereeteu in the actint, tenure of the .political 3ec retary ah Ip by tn Indian Political on the ground that It t^lves experience to Political OTrleers, Sinclair nill have had in all soae seven aoottia by the tin* that ieiily again taxes over cu&amp;rae. ^,uite ajKirt tro&amp; this, if se are right in thinking that you are still contemplating reposting Hickinbolhuis in September (your personal telegrna; to m dated 14th Deceaher, «ibOS) it eould presusabiy be necessary to find ao&amp;ooae to act as Civil Secret&amp;iy If Sinclair, *no, on Hicklnbotnnid's departure, ^.ould becosae substantive civu Secretary, »ere to act as Political Secretary. 6e should be grateful if you could it us nave a to i eg rat* to say shstner in toe circuit, stances I have discussed above you see any objection to tos colonial Cfflcs proposal, as they are anxious to settle their PO£ii£^£ iis QQQZX as pOSSi&amp;iS. 4/V' ‘Ko , 78065/55* Dov/ning Street, S.W.l. answering your letter No. P.Z. 11214/35 of the 5th April regarding the incidence of Captain Sinclair’s pay from the date early in February, when he took up duty at Aden* we waited in order to discuss with him the staff arrangements which should operate when he returns to Aden in September. On Reilly’s return Lake will come on leave and the question arises who is to act as Political Secretary during the four months of Lake’s absence. It appears from your letter that you contemplate that Sinclair will continue to act as Political Secretary until Lake’s return. I think My dear Laithwaite I am sorry to have been rather long in As you know, Reilly is home on leave and there J. G. LAITHWAITE, ESQ., C.I.E x ■r ir- the re must 136 some misunderstanding regarding this. The Government of India telegram of the 30th November, 1934, enclosed in your letter P.Z.7335/34 of the 1st December, 1934, speaks of Sinclair relieving Hickinbotham in September. If Sinclair continued to act, it would mean that the three senior officials at Aden (the Resident, the Political Secretary and Civil Secretary) would all be officials of the Government of India. This would be open to the same objection from our point of view as the one which the Government of India raised regarding Ingrams acting as Political Secretary during the Resident’s absence. Reilly entirely agrees with us that Ingrams should act as Political Secretary during Lake’s absence. Reilly has furthermore been under the impression, as we have, that the intention was that on his return in September Hickinbotham should return to India and that Sinclair would become Civil Secretary. Unless you have any later information, would it not now be best to consult the Governraent of India on the matter? As regards the incidence of Sinclair’s salary from the date when he joined at Aden in February, I have, as(0 as you know, had some discussion with Foyle on the matter, and it was arranged that, before seeking Treasury concurrence, we should reach agreement with you. We agree with the proposal which you make in paragraph 2 that, during the period that Sinclair acts as Political Secretary Imperial funds should reimburse the Government of India at the rate of £900 salary' (less economy cut which is still in force), £100 duty allowance, £90 conveyance allowance / and £100 pension contribution. No claim would be made on us in respect of his passage out to Aden, and Indian revenues would pay the balance of the salary due to him during this period. This arrangement would operate for the period from May to September. After that, as I have said above, we presume that Ingrams will act. We think that it will be best in order to avoid income tax complications, that India should continue to pay Sinclair his Indian emoluments and that they should claim from us quarterly on the usual ’’divisible expenditure” claims the share which we are to pay. This difficulty would ui uo^7~T would not however arise in respect of the conveyance allowance as it is not an emolument for income tax purposes, and this could if it is so desired he paid to him direct. ♦ As regards the emoluments which Sinclair will actually receive, we presume that these will he his Indian salary and overseas pay, plus conveyance allowance (see paragraph of my letter to you of the 11th February;* As regards the incidence of his pay for the period commencing in February up to the date when he began to act as Political Secretary, I gather that your proposal is that the Colonial Office should accept his full salary plus pension contribution for this period. I am afraid that we do not feel able to agree to this. We think that the same arrangement should operate for this period as during the period when he is actually acting as Political Secretary, and we should be glad to know whether you are prepared to agree on this point. As I have explained above, we have still to obtain Treasury concurrence, but if you are prepared toto accept the proposals now made, I think that the Treasury will accept them as a reasonable settlement.

The financial adjustments in connection with these i arrangements have now to be considered and the Colonial Office make their suggestions in the letter below. Their proposal thkx Colonel Lake's pay^'during his acting appointment^Should be as laid down in Colonial Regulation 62 but waiving the provision as to non-payment of allowance while the Resident is on full average pay. This follows the precedent of 1933 when Mr.Champion (Colonial Service Political Secretary) acted for Colonel Reilly (vide P.Z.1033/33) and may be accepted. India would pay half of Colonel Lake's pay during this period. With regard to Captain Sinclair, while he is acting as Political Secretary the Colonial Office would, of course, pay his salary and allowances (India contributing/ Vcontributing through the l/3rd arrangement), propose that he should draw his salary plus Colonel Lakeys conveyance allowance of £90 per annum (which becomes available on the latter’s acting appointment as Resident). Colonel Lake’s local allowance of £100 per annum is regarded as a personal allowance, as in the case of Mr.Champion, (see Treasury letter dated 3rd March 1934 at P.Z. 1649/34 in the attached file) and will not become available for Captain Sinclair. This seems reasonable in the circumstances. Their proposal that India should pay the cost of his passage to Aden seems reasonable since India would, in any case, have^to pay his passage back from leave in England. Their proposal that India should bear the cost of his salary while understudying Colonel Lake, however, seems open to argument. It was at the instance of the colonial Office, who considered it important that he should pick up the threads of the local situation before relieving Colonel Lake, that Captain Sinclair was sent out in January instead of at the beginning of April. Moreover his services there are of more immediate advantage to the ~ Colonial Office than to the Government of India. There seems to be a case, therefore, for telling the Colonial Office that while we accept all their other proposals India cannot bear any of the cost of Captain Sinclair’s salary for this period and-tha-1r-we*-e©»»i*d-e-r*-tHrta--b‘ beyond her contribution theret o uiiierthe ordinary arrangement whereby India pays l/3rd of 'political' expenditure at Aden. If you agree it hardly seems necessary to consult the Government of India before replying to the Colonial Office in the above sense.

J] February ,19 35*. 3o&gt; My dear Laithwaite, We have been considering here the pay arrangements which arise in connection with the forth coming leave of Reilly and Lake and the decision to post Sinclair to Aden last month. As regards the Resident’s leave, it has been decided that Lake should act during his absence and we would propose that Lake’s pay during the acting period should follow what was approved when Champion acted as Resident in 1933. The agreed arrangements in regard to Champion’s pay were set out in Colonial Office letter to the India Offic e No . 17913/53 of the 19th April,1933. We have accordingly included in the Aden Estimates which have now been submitted to the Treasury provision on the following basis for Lake’s salary for the five months during which he will act as Resident.

In addition he would draw the Resident’s sumptuary allowance for this period, and his duty allowance and conveyance allowance as Political Secretary will cease. If you agree to this you will no doubt ascertain in due course whether the Government of India also approve, but we have not yet heard that the Treasury have approved the Estimates, and I therefore suggest that you wait until it is known that the Treasury agree before referring the matter to the Government of India. I will let you know as soon as we get the Treasury reply to the Estimates^ As to Sinclair’s salary,while he acts as political Secretary, we have made provision in the Estimates of a round sum to cover this for the five months in qu es ll° n * WeY/e suggest that in addition Sinclair should draw Lake^ conveyance allowance of £90 per annum, but not his duty allowance^ You will remember that at the time when Rivett Carnac acted as Political Secretary during Champions absence at- Sanaa, the latter f s duty allowance was not paid to Rivett Carnac on the ground that the allowance was in the nature of a personal allowance. The same is the case in respect of Lake's duty allowance and we feel that it should not be transferred to Sinclair. Lastly,there is 'the question of Sinclair's passage to Aden and his pay up to the date, at the beginning of April, when he commences to act as Political Secretary. It is true that we have laid it down that Sinclair will under-study the Political Secretary during'this period, but even so we do not feel that any cost in respect of him should fall on His Majesty's Government until the date when he commences his duties as acting Political Secretary. V/hile we appreciate the point of view of the GovernmentGovernment of India regarding the alternation of posts which gave rise to the decision to post Sinclair to Aden in January, the fact remains that there would have been no difficulty in carrying on with the staff available at Aden without Sinclair. In other words, the decision to adhere strictly to the convention has resulted in an extra officer being posted to Aden for a period of seven months when on the basis of staff requirements, he was not wanted. Ingrams could have stepped into Lake’s shoes and the other two Political Officers could have carried on the work satisfactorily. While, therefore, we have provided for Sinclair’s salary as acting Political Secretary in our Estimates^subject to Treasury approval, departure on leave, and also his passage to Aden,should be borne by the Government of India. Will you kindly let us know whether this proposal is agreeable to the India Office and the Government of India?

JDCFP-441S&amp;P—(Gv712)—28*9-2a—5,U00.Mr. WalWn, Please see the corresponaence with the Government oi India and Aden about Aden posting arrangements below. 2 . On merits there is probably a great deal to be said for Colonel Reilly^ suggestion that Mr. Ingrams, the Political Officer, should act as Political Secretary. But the Government of India are entitled to claim that in the ordinary way acting vacancies are filled at Aden by the promotion of the man in the post next below, and that the Political Secretaryship would normally be filled by the Civil Secretary, difficulty having arisen in this case largely because of Captain Hickinbotham*s juniority. They are also entitled to claim that the principle of alternation (though that is not directly a peint in the x — present instan|e*0-must be maintained. As regards Captain Hickinbotham, while we pressed the Government of India to make him/available for service at Aden last year when we thought that transfer was more a matter of the immediate future than it has turned out to be, we could not, I think, ^ urge them to retain him there indefinitely. 3. In the light of discussion with you I have talked this over with the colonial Officeandasa result have agreed the drafts attached, wfoiofr’-agoi howovor^—subjoct—in Uielr r\nnn tin n n-f ^” + Mritiy. 4. I explained to Mr. Cowell that the Joint (/y* (IK if u.ji-» &lt;- *W: 1 ^/ Committee (have' recommended that transfer shoUid take place •not later than the date oi Federation', which might be some little way ahead;*that while it was quite true that the draft clause in the Bill made no reference to a specific date ana merely said tnat Aden should cease to be a part of India 'on such date as His tsajesty may by Order Council appoint', it was necessary in dealing with this/- 2 - ^ this question to consider the position of the Government of India. Ihey have been overruled on the general question of transfer, which they haa themselves been anxious to postpone until a much later stage, if not indefinitely, and it might he anticipated that they would he reluctant to give effect to it until they had to. Ivhreover, the Colonial Office would agree that there was no consideration of urgency in the matter. It would certainly he convenient that the question of transfer should he disposed of: hut it could not he suggested that the delay involved would materially affect matters* 5. Mr. Cowell said that the Colonel Office had rather been proceeding on the assumption that transfer would take place the moment the Bill was tnrough and that the draft clause had gone to confirm them in that view. But he agreed that if for any reason a further delay, not being longer than the date of the establishment of federation, was inevitable, no serious inconvenience would he involved. * r *■&gt; (XM u H U co I4LA. ^ mA 6c f- &lt;isJr kA ^ r-xci * ,f l. .

I am strongly opposed to both proposals for reasons explained.

I trust that you will approve.PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the Resident at Aden to of State for the Colonies,, ■dated 29th November. deceived 11.20 a.m. 29th November, 1934. Addressed to foreign Delhi, repeated to Colonial Office N0o97 o Your telegram 27th November No.2333. Convention referred to by you was not applied when Champion, Colonial Service, acted for me and Lake acteu as Political Secretary last year and recent ! increase of Colonial Service staff at Auen has in my opinion rendered it no longer necessary or appropriate. Number of Colonial Service officers at Aden has been doubled during last year and they no* consist of Lake, Political Secretary, Jhgyams and Hamilton, Political Officers and Seager Frontier Officer,, Among other objects this increase is intended to provide for relief in leave vacancies and acting appointments end I intended to recommend that if Lake acts for me Ingrams should act as Political Secretary. I have already proposed this to the Colonial Office sami-officially. Ingrams has held several responsible posts before coming to ^-den including acting Colonial Secretary Mauritius and has Id years’ Colonial Service. Since he came to Aden he has been dealing with various Protectorate problems and is now making an extensive tour in the Protectorate. He will therefore be better qutlifieu for the duties of Political Secrecary than Sinclair. The latter’s duties when he was in Aden were confined entirely to magisterial and to administrative work inside Aden Settlement and he has no acquaintance with Protectorate politics or personnel and knows no Arabic. Political Officers here work under the direct control of the Political Secretary and I consider that it would be unsuitable to subordinate Ingrams to Sinclair who incidentally is his junior in age. I recomraena therefore that Ingramsact.ao Political Secretary and in ray opinion no additional Indian Service officer ie required at Aden* Paragraph 2 as to proposed replacement of Hickinbotham by Sinclair as Civil Secretary* As stated in my letter C/2^7 dated 30th April 1932 in which I made proposals regarding post of Civil Secretary I am not in favour of having an officer of more than six to eight years political service in this post, Hickinbotham is exactly suitable for the post and has personal confidence and liking of Arabs p Indians and buropeanSo He desires to stay at Aden until the spring of 1936 when he hopes to be granted leave, I hope that this will be allowed as a result of recommendations of Parliamentary Joint Select Committee, I presume that decision regarding the future of Aden will be taken by Parliament in the course of next year. This will naturally arouse interest in Aden and it may be necessary to allay apprehension locally and prevent development of racial feeling owing to conflicting views of Arabs and Indians, For this and other reasons I am particularly desirous that there should be no change next year in appointment of Civil Secretary and I strongly recommend that Hickinbotham should remain in it 6auPLISATS, Mo. ^ L{ \ \ Z. 7404 /si . j_??d &gt; THE RESIDENCY, ADEN. *7 NoYerabor 1934, 7 Sir, 1 I have the honour to B-pply for five months leave to England on private affairs with effect from the 1st April 1935 or date of availing* 2* I recommend that Lieutenant-Colonel M.C.Lake, Political Secretary, be appointed to act as Chief commissioner.

My dear Parkinson, I have been considering the question of leave and acting arrangements next year, and I shall be grateful if you will let me know whether you think the proposals I am now making are suitable. This summer has been rather severe here, and I am anxious to avoid as much as possible of the great heat next year. I therefore propose to ask for about five months leave, during which time I recommend that Colonel Lake, Political Secretary, should act for me, and that Ingrams should act as Political Secretary. This v/ould be in accordance with the decisions communicated in Colonial Office despatch No. 67 of the 31st August 1928, v/hich contemplated the First Assistant Resident, and in his absence the Protectorate (now Political) Secretary, acting for the Resident; and with the precedent of Champion’s acting appointment last year. Lake had leave from October 1933 to February 1934&gt; but he has had no summer leave to England since 1931 and he also is anxious to avoid some of the heat next year. I therefore propose to apply for my own leave to commence in April which would bring me back to Aden in September, and so enable Lake to escape part of that month which is one of the worst and most trying here. Lake will have completed 18 months continuous service here in August 1935, and under the terms of his appointment A.C.C. Parkinson Esquire, C.M.G-. , O.B.E. , Colonial Office, London.appointment he will then he entitled to ask for four months leave, which he proposes to do. Ingrams, who would continue to act as Political Secretary during Lake ! s absence, will probably himself wish to apply for leave when Lake returns.

As you know recent events have caused these postings to become somewhat involved. As far as Hlckinbotham and Rivett-Garnac^/concerned however the position has not altered, since we decided to send Hickinbotham back to Aden instead of to Persia as we had originally intended. He now returns to Aden as Personal Assistant and if and when Reilly and Champion go off to Sanaa he will officiate as Civil Secretary in place of Rivett-Caraac who v/ill be doing Political Secretary. When Reilly goes back, either Rivett- Carnac or Hickinbotham will have to go, since the latter is getting too senior to remain in the post of Personal Assistant to Reilly. Our original intention was to leave Rlvett-Carnac and post Hickinbotham elsewhere, since on general grounds we do not find it advisable to leave a junior officer too long in a place like Aden which is somewhat of specialists job and which leaves him ignorant of the working of other spheres under the Foreign Department to which he may sooner or later* have to be sent. viewview however of Reilly’s strong representations which have the backing both of yourself and Metcalfe, we will endeavour to move on Rivett-Camac and leave Hickinbotham as Civil Secretary. The only difficulty LAll which will arise weu±d be to find a job for Rivett- Carnac, but as Metcalfe will have returned before this / transfer is likely to take place I shall be able to leave it to him to take necessary action. I hope you did not object to our rather stiff f wire about Wightwick etc. I got a wail from W. to the effect that he was stopped by wire from pro ceeding to Aden after he had sent the whole of his kit and his car to Bombay and after the man who was to succeed him had actually arrived in Palanpur with several truck loads of corm»le-to kit , several chickens, a motor car and a brace of puppies. In addition to that the man who was succeeding Williams had to cancel his leave and there were various other individual in conveniences which arose from this rather sudden change of postings. Such things are, of course, inevitable in such cases, but you will, I hope, realise that the wording of our wire was merely a reflection of the strictures passed on us by the Individuals concerned.

As you know, while the C.O. themselves are not at the moment directly interested in the civil work they will he interested in it once the transfer takes place, and from our point of view at this end it is desirable that questions in connection with the transfer should he disposed of as expeditiously as possible and that no hitch should arise.

The post of Pirst -assistant (who was supposea to be the Pesident's ri 0 ht hana man) was abolished last year for reasons of economy, &amp;na this makes it all the more important that the remaining appointments should be held by good men. I have no complaint to make about the Political Secretaryship, which is satisfactorily filled, ana will, I hope, continue to be so, although the departure of Champion this winter will be a great loss to me. But I am not happy about idle posts of Civil Secretary and Personal Assistant. is not suitea to it, ana is also too senior _Jor it. He himself realises this and would like to go elsewhere; he wished to come to .Aden only because he hoped to succeed as Political Secretary, which is impossible. Both in his interest ana niy own I have therefore asked tnat he be moved. I discussed the position with ^.etcalfe when I was at Delhi early this year, ana I said tnat I should like Hivett-Carnac to be succeeded as Civil Secretary by Hiekinbothan., who was my Personal Assistant from 1931 to 1932, ana who is very capable ana gained a knowledge of Arabic and of local affaiis and likes end is likea oy the ^rabs ana wishes to return to Aden, a Political officer who is keen to serve You know that the former Assistant Residents ana at/at Aden is rather a rarity, and when he is efficient and ..ell suited to tne work there it appears to me to he a sensible and obvious course to make use of him. When 1 spoke to metcalfe, he saiu that he hoped tnat it would be possible to make this change curing the present year, ana I was therefore disappointed when I was tola later that Rivett- Garnac could not be moved at present. Hickinbotham was, however, tola that he would be reposted to Aden as Personal assistant tnis autumn, and j—etcalfe (whom I saw in London a short time ago; said that this might lead to his succession to Rivett-Carnac as Civil secretary next sprin^. This was not what I had asked for, but I accepted the arrangement as probably being the best I could get. I now/ hear from Hicikinbotham (who is on leave in England) that he has been told officially from Simla that theie is a possioi&amp;ity that he will be posted elsewhere than to Aden on his return from leave. This is such a complete disregard of my wishes that I wish to make aprotest. I expect to have difficult ana responsible work to ao when I return to Aden. Relations with the Imam will reQuiie much care uno thought whatever happsns - whether negotiations with him are continued or there is a breach .'vii&gt;ii nim. me Question of the separation of Aden from India (ii proceeded with) will also demand careful ana detailed preliminary work, for which tne help of an efficient Civil Secretary will ce essential. I am also very anxious to launch tne new education arrangements successfully and in this also the Resident needs the help of a good Civil Secretary. Apart from these questions, the ordinary routine past be carried on efficiently with a staff diminished by the abolition of the First assistant.I cannot carry out all these duties properly if I am denied an efficient staff, and I consider that 1 am entitled to ask that my wishes in this respect should receive consideration, and should, if possible, he met. I am sure that ^etcalfe would ao nis utmost to help me in this matter, hut he deals only., with the Foreign Department, ana cannot always arrange appointments without the co-operation of the Political Department. Moreover, he is on leave in England, which makes it more difficult for him to deal with the question, and the sane reason makes it difficult for me to make direct representations to the Government of India. In these circumstances I have decided to appeal to you. I am confident that a communication from the India Office to the Government of India explaining the position ana asking that my wishes about my personal staff should he met as far as possible, would solve this particular problem for me. I ao not think that my request is an unreasonable one. It is that Hickinbothan, should succeed Hivett-Carnac as Civil secretary as soon as possible - that is, not later than next spring, - and that, if this cannot be arranged at once, Hickinbotham should meanwhile be sent to me as Personal Assistant on the expiry of his leave this autumn. I know that it is usual for the India Office to leave personal.appointments to the Government of India, but I nevertheless hope that I can look for its assistance in the circumstances that I have explained. I shall be very grateful if you will be good enough to give me your help in this matter. I apologise for the length of this letter. I should not trouble you with it were not the subject one about which I feel very strongly. Yours sincerely, (3a.)

Para 0 62 of the Colonial Office regulations, quoted by Reilly, applies only to periods when Governor is on leave other than full pay leave, and we are not clear what emoluments will be payable under Colonial Office regulations for period of Reilly’s full average pay leave. We suggest that if the case is covered by Colonial Office regulations they should be applied to this period also. Otherwise emoluments for the whole period may be regulated under para,62 Colonial Office regulations.

My predecessor, Sir Stewart Symes, went to India for this purpose in September 1928, June 1929, February 1930 and January 1931, and I was similarly called to Delhi in November 1931. These visits on each occasion proved most useful in accelerating the satisfactory disposal of outstanding questions which would otherwise have been liable to be delayed owing to Aden’s distance and lack of direct contact with the seat of Government. Local matters in which I am particularly interested at the moaent are Educational reorganisation (my letter No.C/485 dated 20th August 1932 to the Department of Education, Health and Lands), the revision of Aden Act, 1364 (my letter No. a/ 434/6489 dated 17th September 1932 to the Home Department), and the strengthening of the Armed Police, about which I intend to send you a further letter shortly. There are also some other subjects such as future postings, \ about which I should like to talk to you.

With regard to dates, His Excellency would like you to be here while he is here himself and he does not get back from tour till the 25th of January. I would therefore suggest that, if it is convenient to you, you should arrive in Delhi soon after the 20th so as to get some business done before His Excellency returns. We should be very glad to put you up for a few days when you first arrive ana His Excellency, I know, wishes to ask you to stay at the Viceroy^ House from about the 28th.

In the firtst place I gather that nnder the Colonial Office Rtilee the officiating inc’?r!ibent receivee additional pay only if the permanent inotrnbent if? on leave other than fnll pay leave. Ae Indian Service Officers earn fall pay leave at the rate of 5 /22nds of the period spent on duty end may take each leave np to 8 months at any one time it seeros unlikely that a Resident who belongs to the Indian Political Department would ever take oth- r than full pay leave, with the consequence that the Protectorate Secretary, if he were a Colonial Service Officer, would receive nothing more than substantive pay and allowances. (He may, of course, receive entortdment allowance while officiating, but as that is not a remrtnerative allowance it med not be considered). On the other hand, under Fundamental Rule 31 an Indian Service Officer would draw the preeitmptive pay of the post in which he is officiating provided that the duties and responsibilities of such post are greater then tbone of his permanent oost. Presumptive pay of the poet is defined in Fun amental Rule 9 (24) as the pay to which an officer would be entitl d if he held the post permanently and must mean the pay which would be admissible to an Indian Service Resident and not the rate admissible to a Colonial Service Resident. It is true that Funtiamental Rule 35 gives power to the Local Go Vermont (the Government of India is the Local Government in the case of the Indian Political Department) to fix the pay of an o fficiating officer at an amount lower than that admissible under Rule, but I cm not aware under what/what circi«QRtancois this power has been exercised in the pact and Ido not think we ehonld be justified in exercieing it in a cace where the officiating inotrabent aenstmee the full reeponeibilitiee of the poet. It will be seen that the Indian rules are ranch more favourable than the Colonial riles and that the application of two sets of Piles differing so widely is likely to f^ve rise to anomalies# The Fundamental Rules are statutory and I do not see how we can g£ve a Protectorate Secretary who belongs to the Political Deportment less than the Indian pay of a Resident when he officiates as such# It is hardly for this Office to suggest that the Colonial Office should improve their Piles but I do not think that we should object if they decided to amend them so as to allow their officiating pay arrangements to operate even if the Resident were absent on full pay leave, or if they were to go a step further and to allow a Protectorate Secretary of their Service officiating as Resident the Sterling: pay of a Resident whenever he happens to be absent on leave.i f 1 r 1U1 It is requested that in any further communi cation on this subject the under-mentioned letter and number may be quoted, and the reply addressed to — The Under Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Office, London, S. 1.

Please see in this connection Colonel Reilly»s earlier letter of 7th September on P.Z.6319/32. We asked the Government of India for comments on the question of the pay of the Acting Resident in our air mail letter of 28th October. No reply has yet been received, but it may be desirable either to address them again or to send a reminder in the light of your comments on the present letter. 3. There can, I think, be no question that the Protectorate Secretary; who is a British Service officer on a scale of about £1100 a year less 10 %, would be inadequately remunerated by the addition of an acting allowance of say Rs.400 only*! and prima fac j. e i am disposed to think that the simplest course in the circumstances would be that we should lay it down as a general rule that in cases in which the Political Secretary acts as Resident the rules of his own Service should apply. The posts both of Resident and of Political Secretary fall to be filled alternately irom the Indian and the Colonial Services. The Treasury am the Colonial Office, with whom I have discussed the suggestion unofficially are prinia facie disposed to favour it. I am not quite clear what the position is as regards Colonel Reilly’s entitlement to full pay 1 during his forthcoming leave. If the Colonial Service regulations/M wmm •V Jf- regulations 'are applied to kr. Gdampion', as seems on the whole preferable, some difficulty might arise if • the Resident was not entitled to full pay leave. 17 - u Political secretary. ^ The suggested plan will not, I fear, work very satisfactorily. In the first place I gather that under the Colonial Office Pules the officiating incumbent receives additional pay only if the permanent incumbent is on leave other than full pay leave. As Indian Service Officers earn full pay leave at the rate of 5 of the period spent on duty and may take such leav^up to 8 months at any one time it seems unlikely that a Resident who belongs to the Indian Political Department would ever take other than full -ay le^ve, with the consequence that the Protectorate Secretary, if he were a Colonial Service Officer, would receive nothing more than substantive pay and allowances. (He may, of course, receive entertainment allowance while officiating , but as that is not a remunerative allowance it need not be considered). On the other hand, under Fundamental Rule 31 a, Indian service Officer would draw P a y 01 'kbe post m which he is officiating provided that the duties and responsibilities of such post are greater than those of his permanent post. Presumptive pay of the post is defined in Fundamental Pule 9 (24) as the pay to which an officer would be entitled if he held the post permanently and must mean the pay which would be admissible to an Indian Service Resident and not the rate admissible to a Colonial Service Resident.

Local Government (the Government of India is the Local Government in the case of the Indian Political Department) to fix the pay of an officiating officer at an amount lower than that admissible under Pule, but I am not aware under what circumstances this power has been exercised in the past and I do not thinl: we should be justified in exercising it in a case where the officiating incumbent assumes the full responsibilities of the post. It will be seen that the Indian rules are much more favourable than the Colonial rules and that the application of two sets of rules differing so widely is likely to give rise to anomalies. The Fundamental Pules are statutory and I do not see how we can give a Protectorate Secretary who belongs to the Political Department less than the Indian pay of a Pesident when he officiates as such. It is hardly for this Office to suggest that the Colonial Office should improve their rules but I do not think so as to allow thew'off i ciating pay arrangements to operate even if the Pesident were absent on full pay leave,or if they were to go a step further and to allow a Protectorate Secretary of their Service officiating as Pesident the Sterling pay of a Pesident whenever he happens to be absent on leave. fry that we should object if they decided to amend thecaev &lt; lyfly dear Laithwaite, On the 17th of October last we sent to your Department a copy of despatch No. 177, with enclosure, from Reilly dated the 7th of September, 1932, on the subject of the appointment of the Political Secretary to act as Resident and Chief Commissioner during the latter’s absence on leave. The enclosure was addressed to the Secretary to the Government of India and, no doubt, you are awaiting his views, but, having regard to the fact that no provision has been made in the Estimates for 1933 for any additional pay to Champion, and the final figure will, no doubt, have to be settled in the course of the next few weeks, I should be grate ful if you could expedite matters. The Colonial Office would, I think, be inclined to favour the proposal contained in paragraph J. a. IAITHWAITS, KSQ-* &lt; paragraph 4 of Reilly r s letter to India, namely, that as the present Political Secretary is an officer of the Colonial Service, his emoluments for acting as Resident should be regulated in accordance with paragraph 62 of the Colonial Regulations which reads as follows: n When the office of Governor becomes vacant or when the Governor is on leave, other than full-pay leave, the person succeeding to the administration of the Government, if he be an officer of the service of the Colony, will receive half of the salary of the Governor, and half the salary of his own office.' I am not sure, however, whether Reilly will receive full pay whilst on leave, since the leave terms of the Indian Service Resident are as laid down in the fundamental rules, and of these I have no knowledge whatsoever. In any case, however, it is quite clear that Champion cannot be expected to act as Resident without some additional allowance and we shall have to settle the question of incidence of charge as betweenbetween His Majesty’s Government and India of any- increased cost involved.

I have, &amp;c., (Signed) B.R.Reilly. Resident, etc.C/518. The Residency, Aden, 7th September, 1932* From Lieutenant Colonel B.R.Reilly, C.I.E., O.B*E., Chief Commissioner, Aden. To The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Simla. Subject:- Appointment of Protectorate Secretary to act as Chief Commissioner during the latter’s absence on leave. Sir, I have the honour to state that I propose to apply for six months’ leave from April, 1933. In the event of this leave being granted to me I recommend that Mr. R.S. Champion, Protectorate Secretary, be appointed to act for me during my absence as contemplated in Colonial Office despatch No. 67 of 31st August, 1928, India Office letter P.Z.2637/32 of 13th May, 1932, and Colonial Office letter 97683/32 of 25th July, 1932. 2. The question of the Protectorate Secretary’s emoluments when acting as Resident and Chief Commissioner requires special consideration. Hitherto this officiating appointment has been held by the First Assistant Resident, an officer of the Indian Political Department whose substantive pay was considerably greater than that of the Protectorate Secretary. He was granted an acting allowance which, apart from the sumptuary allowance, raised his total emoluments (including overseas pay) to Rs.310C or moremore a month, varying with his substantive pay in the Indian iolitical Department time-scale. The Protectorate Secretary 1 s present salary is equivalent to Rs.1100, and the addition of a similar acting allowance of Rs.400 will raise his emoluments (apart from the sumptuary allowance) to Rs.1500, a sum which is far smaller than that drawn formerly by a First Assistant Resident in similar circumstances, and which is in my opinion inadequate for the duties and responsibilities which the post of Resident and Chief Commissioner entail. 3. In my letter No. A/276/2793 dated End May, 1931, I recommended that an officer acting in this appointment should draw the full pay attached to it, according to the service to which he belongs. This proposal was not approved by the Government of India (vide their letter No. F.139-A/31 dated 13th December, 1931) as at the time it would have resulted in the officiating officer drawing a total sum greater than that admissible to the then permanent incumbent, who belonged to the Colonial Service. This objection would not be valid in the case of the present Protectorate Secretary, who is himself a Colonial Service official, and who would, under my proposal, receive the lower scale of pay sanctioned for the Resident, that is Rs.2500 a month. I shall be grateful if the * recommendation made in my letter of 2nd May, 1931, can be reconsidered in the case of the Protectorate Secretary T s acting appointment in the light of these altered circumstances. 4. Alternatively I suggest that, as the present Protectorate Secretary is an officer of the Colonial Service,v @) 1 Service, his emoluments when acting should be regulated on the analogy of Colonial practice as stated in paragraph 62 of Colonial Regulations, which reads as follows:- ''Then the office of Governor becomes vacant or v/hen the Governor is on leave, other than full-pay leave, the person succeeding to the administration of the government, if he be an officer in the service of the Colony, will receive half of the salary of the Governor, and half the salary of his own office. tT I have, &amp;c., (Signed) B.R.Reilly. Chief Commissioner. -\ •&lt;-97863/32. li^CUXANI . P*Z.4472/32 Sir I am directed to refer to your letter of the 11th COLONIAL OFFICE, BOWING 3THB2&amp;T, 25th July 1932. March (No. P.Z.1223/32), regarding certain proposed changes in the establishment at Aden consequent on the abolition of the post of First Assistant Resident, and in reply to state that the proposals outlined by the Government of India in their letter of the 15th February, No. D.5802,E/31 are agreed to subject to the following conditions, viz;- (1) That the emoluments of the Protectorate secretary, who in future will alaD be First Assistant xiesident, will for the most part continue to be borne upon United Kingdom funds, but that if the officer is drawn from the Indian Service, no more will be paid from those funds than the present scale of emolument^or a Colonial service officer. (ii) that, in either event, the Government of India will bear the cost of any additional emoluments in reject of his duties as First Assistant Resident. (ill) that the office of Deputy Assistant Resident which the Government of India propose to create for the purpose of assisting in tne civil administration will be wholly paid from Indian funds. 2. I am at the same time to suggest that if, in the event, the Settlement work necessarilyxcupies a disproportionate amount of the Protectorate Secretary’s time, the incidence of his emoluments as between United Kingdom ana Indian funds should/ The Under Secretary of State for India Political Department, India Office.should he reconsidered in the direction of India assuning responsibility for a larger proportion thereof to the relief of United Kingdom funds. 3. As regards the proposed alternation between the Indian ana Colonial services of the appointment of Protectorate Secretary, I am to say that this proposal is accepted subject to the following:- (a) That as stated in paragraph l(i), no increased charge falls on United Kingdom funds in the event of an Indian Political Service officer being appointed to the post of Protectorate Secretary. (b) That the concurrence of the Secretary of State for the Colonies in the appointment of such an officer will always be obtained. (c) That the arrangement agreed to in the case of the Resident as set out in the letter from this office of the 3rd April 1928, No* C59270/28, should apply to this post also ♦ 4. I am also to refer to your letter P.Z.2637/32 of the 13th kay, and to say that if at any time the Protectorate Secretary should act for the Resident during the latter’s absence, the principle enunciated in paragraph 2 thereof is accepted, viz. that additional allowances only should be shared between the two Governments, the basis of division of the emoluments of the two substantive posts remaining unaffected by the charge.

Incidence of coat of the poet of Second Assistant Resident and Protectorate Secretary, Aden • Sir, I am directed to refer to telegram from the Secretary of State Iio.775, dated the 10th March 1932. 2. The point raised in paragraph 2 of that telegram appears to hare been already settled under the lAnas' of letter from the India tffi.ee Bo• A.G. 60 4 6, dated the 23rd July 1930, according to which any additional allowances paid to an officer while acting in anotner post, the substantive holder of which continues in receipt of the emoluments thereof,should be divided in the s^e manner as the emoluments of the post in which he is acting, the basis of division of the emoluments of the acting officer's substantive post which he continues to draw remaining unaffected by the change. In the opinion of the Government of India there appears to be no Justification for any departure from this principle. 3. As regards paragraph 3 of the telegram under reference X am to say that under the revised arrangement the Second Assistant and Protectorate Secretary will be called upon to perform 'Qomparatively light additional duties'* for which the Government of India have agreed to bear the entire cost of his special pay of £s. 20 0 /- per mensem. There will e* m *■js* change in hie original duties, which are regarded as being of a political nature, and ae India is already contributing about £ i50000/- a year towards military and political charges, I am to say that in the opinion of the Government of India they cannot equitably be called upon to bear any portion of the cost of his post,simply because it will be held alternately by an officer of the Indian Political department. 1 have the honour to be Sir 3d. 3.B.Howell, Your most obedient servant foreign Secretary to the Government of IndiaFrom Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State for India, repeating telegram addreased to Chief Conmaaioner, Aden.

I find that the Finance Department here take the view that the arrangement referred to in our official letter of 13th May, P.Z. 2637/32, bsns not, in fact, any point in the circumstances of Wightwic^s case. In their view the underlying principle of that arrangement was that the additional cost of officiating arrangements should be divided between the Colonial Office and the India Office in the same manner as the emoluments of the post in which the Officer was officiating, that this was a give and take arrangement and that so long as the officiating officers were drawn from the Aden Establishment and continued to discharge the duties of their substantive appointments, it was one that would work reasonably fairly as between Indian and Imperial revenues. They point out that Wightwick is not now on the Aden Establishment and that the extra cost of the officiatingChief Commissioner. They would not see the same objection if the Colonial Office were in the habit of sending out an officer from this country when an officer of their service was officiating as C&amp;ief Commissioner and applying the arrangements in nnpnt, inn.

It is satisfactory and should greatly simplify arrangements that Wight wick is willing to curtail leave to act for Reilly. It is, however, essential, as Wightwick will be required to take Wilberforce Bell’s place at Kolhapur for about three months while the latter is employed on special duty to examine the question of transferring the Bombay States to the Government of India, that he should arrive at Bombay not later than October 21 st, and we regret therefore that we cannot spare his services beyond the middle of October. We hope, in these circumstances, that it will be possible so to arrange matters as to terminate early in October Wightwick’s period of officiating duty at Aden. Financial arrangements will form the subject of a separate communication in due course. But we would remind you in the meantime that it is not so much the inadequacy of staff as the fact that the Resident wishes to take the First Assistant with him to Sanaa that recessiuaLat Wightwick's appointment.

We regret, however, that we oannot spare Wightwick 1 a services beyond the middle of October. It is essential he should exrive at Bombay not later than 21st October, l as he will be required to take Wilberforce-Bell’e place at Kolhapur for about three months, while latter is employed on special duty to examine the question of transfer of Bombay States to the Government of India.

We shall address you again in due oourae about financial arrangements. Meanwhile, we must remind you that the necessity for Wightwick'a appointment arises not so much from inadequacy of staff as from the fact that the Resident wishes to take First Assistant with him to Sanaa.

Subject to the interests of the service, the Resident may, after every tour of residential service, be granted vacation leave with full pay for the time necessarily taken on the journey to the United Kingdom plus 3-^- days for each complete calendar month of residential service; and, if specially detained on public grounds after the completion of a tour of 15 months service, he may be granted vacation leave for days more with full pay in respect of each completed calendar month that he may have been detained. In the case of a Resident who is returning to Aden for further service, there may be added to his vacation leave a further period of leave with full pay, known as “return leave”, for 3-g- days for each completed calendar month of residential service, plus the time necessarily taken on the journey from the United Kingdom.” SuchSuch leave will be with full pay, exclusive of entertainment allowance. 4. It should be observed that the Governor of Somdliland, unlike other Colonial Governors, receives no passage allowance at the beginning and end of his term of office, but is granted instead free first-class passages (with an allowance of £40 towards the cost of his wife’s passage once in each direction during each tour of service) between Ihgland and Somaliland on first appointment, leave and termination of appoint ment.

Since the departure of the Turks from the Yemen the situation has altered completely and the political duties and responsibilities in Aden have increased very considerably in consequence. Barrett, as Pirst Assistant Resident, rendered services of a high order and he has proved himself a most February 1925, I feel it is due to the officers who Prior to the war the Political responsibilities Throughout my tenure of appointment, Major valuable(43?) valuable servant of Goverrment. He has hah to deal with most difficult and delicate questions requiring great tact and considerable knowledge of the country and its politics. His work in connection with the negotiations with the Imam of Sanaa has required the utmost patience, and he never spared himself in his efforts to bring them to a satisfactory conclusion. I regret, as I ha-re explained elsewhere, that I found it impossible to bring the Imam to a final settlenent, but this ia no way reflects on the work done by my Political Assistants. Major Barrett holds the confidence of the Arabs to a remarkable degree, and he treats them sympathetically and firmly. He officiated as Political Resident during periods of my absence on leave, and duty, and his woxk in this capacity was excellent. Major Reilly officiated as First Assistant Resident during Major Barrett’s absence on leave, and for a short period as Political Resident. His work as officiating First Assistant Resident gave me ample opportunity of appreciating his capabilities. He had to do a great deal of the spade work of the negotiations with the Imam of Sanaa andhis patience and skill in dealing with the Imam’s finvoy - the Q,adhi A1 Arishi - deserves the greatest praise. I have the highest opinion of his ability, tact and capacity for work. The Arabs have confidence in him and he treats them with sympathy and firmness. He is a most valuable officer. I would request that, subject toy our approval, my opinions regarding Majors Barrett and Reilly may be placed on record and communicated to the Government of India. I owe them both a deep debt of gratitude for the assistance they invariably gave me. They never spared themselvest themselves and I consider myself most fortunate in having had two such loyal and capable Assistants whose reliability and self reliance is of great value to the State.
