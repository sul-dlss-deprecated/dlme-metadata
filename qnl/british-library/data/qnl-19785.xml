I visited Sharjah, A1 AJman and Debai in w Shoreham' between 50th August ana 1st September, exchanging c^lls with the Residency Agent and the Shaikhs of these places. The re vival of a blood feud dating back to about 1920 was threatening to develop intoA-^arbetween Sharjah and A1 Ajman, three subjects of the latter Shaikhdom having recently fired at ( but missed) Shaikh Bachmum, the father-in-law of the Shaikh of Sharjah whilst being received by him at his house, after which they rode off. The Shaikh of Sharjah who complained said that Ajman had threatened him and had mrny Bedouin allies whilst the latter informed me th-1 he himself had given the order to fire and what ever happened intended to attack Shaikh Bachmum and knew th?t it meant war between Ajman and Sharjah. As there /were a number of British subjects in both Shaikhdoms ana the Imperial Airways Aero drome and Rgst House was at Sharjah it setmea something had to be done about the matter. After lemgthy and protracted interviews ?nd the consumption of considerable quantities of sherbet and coffee and sweetmeats combined with a little forceful persu?si on a meeting of the two ruling Shaikhs was arranged at which they rubbed noses^ and over clasped h nds and in the n^me of Allah made a solemn de claration that no further quarrelling would take plj-ce for a period of 4 months during which time negotiations would be entered into withf view to conoittaing a/f ormal and perm* nent peace.

It is of course inadvisable for us to undertake any such responsibilities if they can he avoided. Our general policy on the Trucial Coast is ^o con fine our intervention, as far as possible, to enforcing Treaties between tbe Suaikhs and oui— selves: the relations between the Shaikhs should be their own affair. I therefore warned both Shaikhs that if, in the course of their quarrel, the lives or property of Britisi.. su ■ oi tL.- safety of the Air Port at Sharjah, were endangered I should hold them responsible, and, in particular I told the Shaikh of Sharjah that Abdur Rahman had already spent 3 years in exile in Aden, and that if he was the cause of any more trouble, I should have to think seriously of deporting him a L air. 15.

I have the honour to say that when 1 took your leave opposite umra ul Qaiwain with much difficulty 1 reached Sharjah at night on account of tempest in the sea. On tne morning of the 15th January 1334 (28th Ramazan 1352) i despatched your letters to the Shaikhs of Ajman and oharjah saying that you had ordered the Shaikh of Dehai and me to intervene 'between these two Shaikhs, i now send herewith for your perusal my letters to all the three Shaikhs (and the letter of the Shaikh of Dehai to you. 2. On the 21st of January 1934 t15th of Shawal 1352] one Baluchi and two Bedouins came opposite Sharjah, met a shepherd, v/ounded him with a dagger, seized ahout one hundred goats he had and retreated to Ajman. The 'brother of the Shaikh of bharjah hurried in their pursuit, 'bullets, were exchanged in the desert and he returned to Sharjah without having rescued the goats. ' r hen the night set in he together with (some of) the people of Sharjah arrayed tne cannon placed on the house of the Ruler of Sharjah towards the precincts fif Ajman. On the 22nd January 1934 they started firing cannon early in the morning. The people of Ajman came outside the town and the parties were engaged in firing cannons and guns from morning till sunset. B'rom amongst the people of Sharjah three were wounded and from those of Ajman side one 'Baluchi and one Arah were killed and two wounded. On the 23rd of January i went to Dehai and came 'back with Shaikh Said 'bin Maktum to Sharjah. On this day also they engaged in hostilities and one man was wounded each from Sharjah and Ajman.3. 'me Lihaikh of De^bai and i, therefore, obtained five days truce from the Shaikh of oharjah and went 'by sea to Ajman where (also) we sucoeeded in securing a similar respite. Later on negotiations were started 'by the 3haikh of DelDai and myself for reoonoiliation with the Shaikh of Ajman. The last-mentioned put forth his old claims 'belonging to nis father. The Shaikh of 'Jehai replied tnat these claims were not executed 'by reason of their navingj been existing 'between his father and Shaikh Khalid 'bin Uimad ^the late Ruler of Sharjah) and hence too old to 'be entertained now, and added that he was going to 'bring ahout reconciliation 'by 'burying the old feuds which took place 'between them. » 4. The Shaikh of Ajman then raised his claim against the divers residing at the village lirah v/ho had not paid the dues they owe him, nor they had 'been allowed to work with their xMakhudas while he had further claims against certain individuals in Kirah in way of diving. 1 told the Shaikh that this question was to 'be deferred to the diving season, 'but as for the Shaikh of Sharjah he would pay off the dehts of the divers or return them to Ajman to tneir liakaudas and tne claims would 'be settled 'between tnem according to the diving law. 5. These claims were, however, settled in my presence according to the agreement registered in the 'Book of Pacts' on the 3rd of Kaja'b 1297 (^4th Jaune 1879) and the Shaikh of Ajman accepted the settlement. 6. On eht 27th January 1934 l returned to Sharjah with Shaikh Jumah 'bin Maktum, informed the Shaikh of Sharjah accordingly and he accepted the arrangements. 'Jonsequent- ly i took the Shaikh of Sharjah to the village of Hirah and sent for the Shaikhs of Dehai and Ajman who came in itihe launch of the Ruler of Dehai 'by sea. 1 took the Shaikh of Debai in my launch and all of them assembled there, i reconciled them to peace and to the satisfaction ofof all of them.

That the claim would 'be forthcoming from tae Snaikh of Ajman at the time of the great diving is quite possible. But the 'Jhief of the village T Iirah is frightened on account of the police guards (Fidawis) of the Shaikh frequently visiting his village and therefore threatens them not to trespass his village. The Shaikh of Ajman reported the matter to the Shaikh of Sharjah sao who sent for the ahovsmentioned 'Jhief and asked him why he threatened the police guards of the Shaikh of Ajman. The jhief replied that he was afraid of them as they had formerly fired guns at him, though he was not hurt.

The T.O. stated on IRth ^anuary 1927 that the balance held by us on account of royalty payments was Es. 5983/5/-. At the enhanced rate of Rs. 200/- per mensem this was sufficient for the cost of nearly 2% years maintenance.

I bet? to forward herewith a letter received by me from Ha.11 f Naser ben Abald and Ha.11 Ahmad ben Abdollah Al-Lutah, British subjects, residing at Atfman, In original, stating that ^halkh Homald ben Abdol Aziz, Chief of Ajman, sent a man named Jaber ben Abdollah of Abu Dhabi, to Inform them on his behalf that they should not advance the crew of their boats, who are from Ajman, ^ that the crew would pay back their debts at the commencement of the diving season and that they would not be protected by him during their stay at Ajman. They sent a man on their behalf to find out the truth of this from the Shaikh, but the latter replied them in the same sense as he had told Jaber ben Abdollah, At present they are much alarmed that some thing may happen to them when they know nothing. Firstly, I took the statement of Jaber and enclose It here with for your Information, T wrote a letter *To.?04 dated 16th Ra,1ab 1340 ( = 16.3.S2), at once to Shaikh Homald ben Abdol Aziz on the subject and described the matter to him, a copy of which T heir to enclose, T received a rerly from the Shaikh which Is also forwarded herewith for your information, which states that he is aware that Al-Lutah are British subjects, but the object of sending Jaber ben Abdollah was to recover money from them In the same way as his subjects paid him. The amount has been Imposed by him as a fine (subscription) for ^ ^ In the interior. Al Ben Lutah did not af?ree to pay the fine', T sent him a reply (vide No,20fi dated 17th Pajab 1340) and stated (X that his tionduu^. towards the British subjects was not satiSTactory and that the result of this attitude was not zood for him. Al- Ben Lutah are not bound to pay fines as his subjects do but have payable from the only to pay the customary taxe8XM8xi®/d1vers at the commencement of diving season according to ruler. At las^ the Shaikh of Ajman sent me a letter dated 20th Rajab 1340 (=20/3/?2) In which he hag guaranteed security of the life and property of Al Ben Lutah, British subjects. Meanwhile,I assured them that they would be safe and they are now in peace. The ShaikhThe Shaikh of Ajman Is a cruel reason ard exacts money from hie subjects 'by force, ard Intends by such a treatment of Ben Lutah, who a^e British subjects, to oppress them as well. T would suppest for your approval that you may write a letter to the Shaikh of A .iman in this connection, so that he may ston his unsatisfactory attitude towards the British subjects and foreigners I.e. the Persian subjects. Letter dated 15 th Ha jab (15.3.PP.) from Faji Faser her Abald and Hajl Ahmad ben Abdollah Ben Lutah to the Residency Asrent. A. C. You are aware of the unsatisfactory attitude of Shaikh Homaid ben Abdol Aziz towards us in our business with the divers and others. We have repeatedly informed you and you order us to remain quiet. Last night Shaikh Homaid sent us Jaber ben Abdollah to inform us that we should not nay the neople of Ajman who act as divers on our boats and that they would po for diving and pay what Is due to us. He said that we are not under his protection, and we are really frightened by this statement. You know that we are British subjects, have resided at A^man for many years and have built houses etc., and now If we are not protected by this ^halkh^we fear that some thing may hanpen to us unexpectedly. We sent Ghanem ben Shaiban to him asking him the truth of this affair, but he replied in the same sense as he told Jaber. It is rot hidden from you that we have nroper-ty and many claims at Ajman ard we are in much trouble on account of the Shaikh^s attitude.*ttk We are now sending Isa ben Ahmad and Jaber ben Abdollah to describe the matter to you. ' r e beg you to Five us security and arrange our affair as we ca^t continue to be in * this state. Please send us a reply. Statement made by Jaber ben Abdollah of Abu Dhabi. ^lecor'ded on 16th Rajab 1340 (=]6th March 19?P). I am a resident of Abu Dhabi. On 13th Rajab (13.3.) T left Abu Dhabi and proceeded to Debal and thence to Ajman. T stayed there as a cruest of Haji Naser ben Aba Id ben Lutah. Two days after('If- after my arrival T rroceeded to Shaikh Hoiraid hen Abdol Aziz to pay him a visit. After drirklncr coffee T went away from the Shaikh's waltirir room. He told me to take a messare from him to Ha.ji JTaser her Aba Id and Ha .11 Ahmad ben Abdollah to the effect that they are not under his protection, that they are not In security to live at A.lman, that they should not pay their divers of Ajman and that If they do so they will not dive for them and they cannot pet their money back. T told him that they are SxtKKk British sublects and that It was not frood fo^ him to say so. He said that T should tell them so and that the matter did not concern me, I therefore Informed Hajl Waser and Ahmad as T was told by the Shaikh. Letter No,204 dated 16th Ra.lab 1340 (=](5/3/PP) from *,A,, Shargah, to the Chief of Ajman, A , C, I have to inform you that I received a letter from Ha.^l Faser ben Aba Id and Ha .11 Ahmad ben Abdollah ben Lutah, British subjects residing at A.lman, stating that you have sent them Jaber ben Abdollah of Abu Dhabi to Inform them that they are not allowed to advance the divers of their boats at a irran who ar»e Indebted to them, on account of diving end that It Is not safe for them to.reside at Aiman, T was much surnrised to hear that you have sent such a message to British subjects as they are a large fairily, have houses, boats, etc,, and reside at A.iman. Such persons should not be told In this way. If you see anything fr'om them you should Inform me and I will communicate with them. If it did not produce ary result I will report the matter to the Hon'ble the Political Resident, I am much surprised by your attitude which Is unsatisfactory. But you wish to e^or-ce lllee-al orders on Ben Lutah as you do on the people of A jman by recovering money according to your own wish. It Is not known whether the Political Resiiert agrees that British subjects should •pay this. My friend, I see it better for you to abandon this unsatisfactory attitude and to send a letter of securltv to Ben Lutah. Intrigue and mischief will not produce Rrood result to you. If you do not send the letter you are responsible to the PollticslPolitical Residert for ary in.lury that 'happens to the lives or property of Al Lutah. Pleas© ssrid ire sr* early r^ply. Letter dated 16th Rajab 3340 (=16/3/??) from Shaikh Horoaid her Abdol Aziz to the Residency A^ent, Sharpah. A .C. I received your esteemed letter and noted Its contents. You wrote that Al-Lutah are British subjects. I do not deny this and the Governrpent is the protector of all. You say that they sent Jaber to you. T air asking them to pay the same thine as T have asked my subjects to pay who dive for them, but they did not pay. T sent Jaber to them that the divers will po to dive and pay them back at the comrr en cement of the dlvlnpr season. You know them and when you came to Ajman with them they prevented you from conine- to see me while I was wnitlnj* for you and expected you to come.

You say that you know Al Ben Lutah are British subjects and do not deny It; so what was the reason that you sent Jaber ben Abdollah to tell them that they a^e not safe and that they are not under your protefct^on if they reside in Ajman. 7 Do you not know that this p action is unsatisfactory of you. If anything happened to them after- your saying so you will certainly be held responsible by the Hon*ble the Political Resident. My friend, your attitude towards Al Ben Lutah is quite wrong. Tf you want to ret money from them you should do so in a suitable meaner because they are rot your subjects but their lives and property should be protected at Ajman in the snme way as those of British subiects residing in the tens of the Trucial Co^st which ar-e (Jn treaty N terms with the High Government. You say that they did not pay you as your subjects do. They have not to pay you anvt'^ni? only the usual taxes leviable from the divers at the commencement of thefrom them. Please take my ativioe ani te a letter of Fuicir* y- for the lives and- property of Al Ben Lutah at A.jman to the # effect that they will not be Interfered with by you and then you should think of your object.

I wrote him a letter at once and sent it with a special man on my behalf forbidding him from treating the Government subjects in this way. w hen H.V.S.'Cyclamen' visit 3d Shargah I informed the Commander who said that he would visit A jrran after the settle ment of Hemriyyeh affair. The Commander however^ sent a message to the Shaikh of Ajman informing him that he would come to pay him a visit. After the settlement of the Hemriyyeh affair the weather was Shamal and the Commander nroceeled to Daba. On his way back the sea was rough on account of Shamal / when we reached Hemrlyyeh / and the Commander could not visit Ajman and only came to Shargah. TTT ith great difficulty I and Shaikh Khalel ben Ahmad landed from the man-of-war and the Commander left for Henjam. The Shaikh of Ajman and some of his followers came at once to the Agency to apologise for what he had done to Al Ben Lutah and stated that he would fro to see them and satisfy them in any way they wished and that he would return their divers. There^ori in order to ensure the peace of Al Ben Lutah and their residence at their houses and attendance to their 'diving' business and tr-de, T proceeded personally to Ajman and went to the house of Haji * T aser ben Ahmad, Chief of Al ^en Lutah.

A«C • I be^ to report that in 1921 a diapute occurred between iihaikh Khaled ben Ahmad and Abdor Uahnan ben Huhanad one of the i^awasem shaikhs residing at Hirah village, a dependency of Shargah. By the asaistance of the inhabitants of the village Abdor Kahnan occupied ita tov/era. a reconciliation v/aa made bex.woen the Shaikh and Abdor liahman by Captain of V H.-i.S. 'Triad' and t\vo v agreements dated Oth January 1021 v/ere concluded between them, copy of which waa forwarded to Colonel Trevor enclosed with my letter Jo. 150, dated 12th January 1921. Since then they maintained friendly relations with each other. The aon of the late Shaikh Saqar ben IChaled named Soltan ben Saqar was formerly reaiding at Jhar/^ah but two years a,7,0 aa he did not receive hia father^s inheritance from Shaikh Khaled ben Ahmad he reaided at Debai. In the month of iiarch 19215 Soltan married Abdor Uahman ben liuhamad'a daughter in the village of Hirah and took her to Debai. On account of this Shaikh Ahaled and hia brothexs became displeased with Abdor Rahman^ i'he slanderers misrepresented matters to them and every one became suspicious and afraid of the other. Shaikh Khaled and hia brothers put a few baluch and Arab watchmen in the towers of Hirah village against Abdor Rahman» I ht3ard that on Oth July 19215 Abdor Rahman and a few men of the inhabitants of the village occupied 15 towers from the Baluchis by trick and expelled them to Shargah. The Shaikh of Shargah arrested the Chief of the Baluchi watchmen and imprisoned him. / .t present Shaikh Khaled is collecting Bedouins and taking them to the village thinking that Soltan ben Saqar and Abdor Rahma ben Muhamad may come for the occupation of the village. Abdor Rahman and the inhabitahts of Hirah are occupying the towers and have a number of 'oeople with them. I consider that if Soltan orooeeds to the. vili^the inhabitants of shar^ah and the ^causa his late father, '^ ShaikhShaikh iiaqar ben Khaled, v/ao Jiind to them on account of which probably a disturbance nay occur at ohai'gah as its inhabitants navo left, I will state in due course if any thing happens.

V/ith reference to ray report i (o.f515, dated J3Gnd July 102^, regarding the trouble between J^aikh Khaled ben Ahnad and Abdor Uahiaan ben Uuhamad, resident of II' rah, I be s to ^tate that the uaid Jhai]:h collected about ^vO Bedouin men at Shargah and the inhabitantJ3 of ohargah to consult then about attacking the said village. They replied to the ikh that they v/ere unable to attack the villa ge and that its inhabitants were ;-rret*t in number among v/hom they had relatives. They have no selfish object in view so -that they attack the village and cause bloodshed, as soon as the ohaikh heard the disagreement of the inhabitants of Shargah it became certain to him that if he compels them to attack the village thev would act in a wav askel me to intervene between him, Abdor Rahman and the inhabitanti of the village. In order to put an end to the trouble between ohargah and tne village and secondly in order to safeguard the claims of British subjects due by the Arabs of Shargah and the I sent Haji iusuf ben Abdollah to Abdor Kahman and the inhabitants of the said village to ask them as to the reason of their dispute with shaikh Khaled. I received a renly from them which I enciose herewith for your information, complaining that they had been oppressed by the ohaikh's brother, Abdollah ben Ahmad. I arranged with the ohaikh that justice should be administered through the Agency in the claims of the inhabitants of the village. Then I asked the Shaikh to confirm what was arranged officially by a letter and also to undertake the security of Abdor Rahman and some of the inhabitants of the village who come to the Agency to interview the Shaikh and make -oeace. I bog to forward herewith two letters from the ohaikh on the subject as well -as the terms of peace. I sent again HaJi Yusuf to the said village on account of diving, especially this year that the village/? ■S» I village v/ho returned with Abdor Rahman and 3 men of the village. i The ohaikh, hia brothers and the Headnan of Henriyyeh, Shaikh Abdor Hahnan ben &gt;iaif^ ;&gt;■ prooont; and the Ueaidency Agent effected a verbal agreernent between the Shaikh and Abdor Kahman to live in peace and to desist fron intriguing against each other. The Shaikh siuouid recover the claims of the inhabitants of the village from his brother, Shaikh Abdollah ben Ahmad. A dispute occurred between the Shaikh, Abdor uahman and the inhabitants of the village about the occupation of one of Ua. the towers of the villa ^e which the Shaikh I l I too to h' 14. occupied by him. Abdor Rahman and the inhabitants of the village sa'^Lt^hat it should be vacanted or demolished. In ordBr that the inhabitants be in peace and security I arranged to put 2 watchmen on behalf of the Agency in the tower under dispute for 20 days / \:hQoe expense^ ujiuuld bo paid by/ the inhabitants of the village. During this period the matter of the tower will be discussed with the Shaikh and either it will be demolished or left vacant as it was during the time of the late Shaikh Saqar ben Khaled. At present the Agency has kept 2 men in the tower till the termination of the period. Both parties agreed and ex-nressed their gratitude and the inhabitants of Shargah and the village bo/Tun ta praya^for the prosperity of High -rovernment. Shaikh Khaled ben Ahmad allowed his Bedouins to leave Shargah and likewise Abdor Rahman and the inhabitants of the village. I beg you to virite a letter to Shaikh Khaled ben Ahmad about thn ii ^fn'r i. nn-i bntvimnn him. and the inhabitants of the village and the reconciliation jihai I w by the Agency between them and confirm the peace as was arran^ed in any way you deem advisable.

They are working now in the oambuq of Shaikh Abdollah. The bi^^est fault that they committed against us is that they deceived the Baluchis whom I had put in the tower and made them our enemies. Whenever they see one of our friends they prevent him from us by promises. They had bribed some men of the viliage of Hirah to kill me. I came to know of this during one nir^ht when I and my companions were walking, but rod saved me. Then how one can rely upon a person who intends to kill him.

I notice that one of the grievances of the Arabs of Ilirah was the occupation of a tower in the village of % Hirah by your nen which used apparently to remain vacant in the 'time or the late ohaikh oa iar ben Khalid, iiy friend, my experience has shov/n to me that the ^rabs hate changes and if it is a fact that your predecessors, at least for some years, have not occupied any of the towers of the village of Hirah, I ask that you will consider the matter very carefully before you introduce any innovations as, in my experience, they aliaost always lead to trou le. I regret that other work and the absence of ii.I.ii .s. M Lawrence H prevented my coming to the Crucial Coast this hot weather and that I do not see any present opportunity of paying you a visit. But you may rest assured that in this coming cold v/eather the resident will certainly be paying a visit to the Crucial Coast and I hope that until he cones there will be no question of any further trouble in this natter. you Political Resident, Persian i*ulf.v&lt;%) It ao ,&lt;* c ^ f of 1983.

In the nonth of April 1021 the oha 1 '-:h and the inhabitants of Hirah kept 2 watchmen in the tower which had been built near the place where the inhabitants of Hirah were taking their drinking waoer in order to protect those who were coming for water from the Bedouin kidnamers on the wells*. When the present disagreement happened between Abdor Rahman and the ^haikh the latter,in the month of March 1023 kept more wauchmen in the 3 towers of llirah. I understood that Jhaikh Khaled 1 s brother, ohaikh Abdollah ben Ahmad, who is in charge of the affairs of the slukhdom of ohargah, had secretly appointed some men at Hirah to press Abdor Rahman to leave Hirah. Also the inhabitants of Hirah were complaining of ohaikh Khaled* s oppressions to them by taking money and diving slaves from them by force and sending them in his brother, Jhaikh Abdollah' s boat. On account of this Abdor Rahman and the inhabitants of Hirah .'joined hands with each other and' occupied the towers which were in possession of the ohaikh's watchmen, asking the removal of the watchmen, oppressions and the secret intrigues against Abdor Rahman ben .liuhamad. Under these circumstances I consider that oppressions and intri'jues of the ohaikh^s brother were not desirable. After the conclusion of the present peace between Shaikh Khaled, Abdor Rahman and the inhabitants of Hirah, I advised the Shaikh to behave well as injustice always lead-to trouble and iisturbance. 'Jhe Shaikh replied that^will treat Abdor Rahnan and the inhabitants of Hirah in a respectful manner and in accordance with the agreement he will return the 2 divers to the inhabitants of Hirah through me at the termination of Iof divin^ oeaaon, :11th rj ;ard to the tov/or in vmich uatchmen were kept on behalf of the Agency for 130 days, on the 10th of .Moharram 134a (=23-8-23) it was arranged that three vmtohraen on behalf of ohai:;h iChaled should be put in that tower till the reat of the tanty of Hirah return fron diving when the natter of the tower v/111 be settled. \v H.l.U.a, 'Lawronoa', Shar'^ah, ^9th Habi II , 1542 8th December 1923, TO Shaikh Abdor iiahman ben Mohamad of Hirah.

With reference to your loiter dated ;3yth waM II, 1^543, to Abdor Kahinan hen Mohamad of Hirah, I pef; to state that I sent your letter to Shaikh Khaled ben Ahmad, ohief of Shargah, I'or transmission to the said Ahdor Rahman. Shaikh Khaled asked me to d'^soxtch that letter to ..in v /hioh I did. I received a renly rrom hin x'or 'iour Honour which I iorvard it nerev/ith. beven days after the receipt of Abdor nahman's leLter to iour nonour Shaikh Khaled used bad words against tne inhabitants oT nirah who united with jibdor Rahman ben Mohamad and arrested une Amir who was an inhabitant or Hirah and appointed on behalf of ohaikh Khaled at that nlace and nut nim in prison. When Shaikh Khaled heard this he at once dragged tne e;un out of Shargah and placed it opposite Hirah and asked the Shaikh of Ajnan to assist him against rtirah. The said Shaiku got his gun ready and waited Tor Shaikh Khaled to .f^o near tiirah when the bhaikh or ivjman and nis rollowers marohjon nirah with their gun In ordex' to xire on it from the eastern side and Shaikh Khaled and nis Tollowers xrem the western side. Tne inhabitants of Shargah did not approve of dragging gun and asking assistance ^rom tne bhaikh of A.lman who was a foreigner. The inhabitants or iiirah made barricades by gunny bags round Hirah and occunied tne nigh nouses xor lighting. However both parties were ready to ^ight each other. The notables or bhargah went to Shaikh Khaled and advised him that his and the shaikh or Amman's croceeding to Hirah was not advisable as a large oloodshed will occur 'between tnem, tnat the inhabitants oi Hirah were nis sub.jectrainee a long time, tnat bloodshed will create a great trouble betv/een them and tnat th- bust thing ior uim to do is to ask the ueeidency Agent to put an end to tnis trouble. In the meantime I heard tnat Sultan son of bhaikh Saqar oen Khaled who was residing at uebai had married t^e aaugnter or Abdor Rahman ben Mohamad and that ne was going witn a large number oi' Henoulns to Hirah to assist Abor Rahman as tne Shaikh of a jmar waswaa going to aaaiat shaikh Khaieri ben Ahmad a^alnat Hi rah. When »^€KaJ this newd waa apread among tne people ox Shargah they^x n ^tenec. and their notables came to tne Agency at Shargah asking me to extinguian the disturbance. At the inalstance or the notables ox Shargah and in order to quiet Lhe righting which was ^olng to occur between the public and waa probably reaching Ras-ol-Khaima 5 &lt;rif fron Debai, I wrote to the Ghaikha *A.jman and uebai ITos 50:5 and 50&amp;, dated 22nd Jamadi I, 1342 ^1-12-23); joples or which and ^ the Shaikh of Ajman 1 s reDly in original, ai-e enolOBildC xor your information, I told the messenger or tne Shaikh of Alman tuat ir he comes wiLh his gun to niran he would be a cause or public trouble in the towns of Trucial wOast and would be held resDonaible b.y the iion'ble the Political resident. The said Shaikh did not interfere and also the Shaikh of uebai prevented Shaikh Soltan ben Saqar. Shaikh Khaled's messenger named Mohamad ben Khadem, a leading man of Shargah, came to me wltii a letter x'rom him making x'or a .tuuc oi •■'i days to arrange xor a peace, upon this I wrote a letter to all the inhabitants of Uirah, copy of which I encloae for your information, and sent it witu ria.ji Ahmad oen baahir and Shaikh Khaled's messenger to dirah in order to give tnem advice and make a set element oetw^en them and their Shaikh, Khaled ben Ahmad^ and to release ^hose who were imprisoned by them. I received a reply from Ha.ji Ahmad ben mshir tnar ne nad released the prisoners and that tne inhabitants ox nirah ask saie-conduct ^rom the Agency to come to Shargah xor peace. I wrote to Shaikh Khaled oen Ahmad dated 20th jamadi I, 1342, ^=4th January 1924) to write a letter of safe-conduct to tne nesidency Agency.

During tne peace the shaikh reinstated Saeed ben Majed, uncle ox the .ex-Amir, as an Amir over tnem at uirah. The disturbance was over and peace waa established between iiirah and Shargah. As regards Abdor Rahman ben Mohamad I ordered him to go out or Hirah in- order that there je no dieturbanoe and tne people■ r * 'I .be at peaoa as he is a mlsohier naker and always na^es intrigues amon f.. tne people.

The Residential Agent, Khan Sahib Isa ihn Abdul Latif, informed me that trouble had arisen between the Shaikh of Ajman and some of the British subjects^there on account of his having sent away to Debai, a week before, some 60 pearl divers who owed the British subjects considerable sums on account of advances made; these advances are made by the pearling agents as maintenance expenses and retaining fees in anticipation of the services of the divers and are sometimes paid for years ahead; the Shaikh takes a percentage of the advances made. 8. On 21st April the 'TRIAD' sailed from Shargah and called at Ajman where the British subjects, mainly Khojas, came on board to make their representations; the Shaikh Hamid Ibn Abdul Aziz, also came on board, and after a conference, undertook to redress the grievances of the British subjects by arranging for the return of the divers from Dibai, and to cause no further trouble.' » v N ProE- Thft Rosid^ncy Arrant, Sharfnxh * To ~ H.M.Political Resident &amp; Connul-Gftnaral, B^.ahir^ * tfi No. 14^ dated 25th April 1024.

I have beccome very much astonished of your treatments with British subjects residing in Ajman which are not good. You are aware that Al Ben Luta are British subjects and how many times the Hon'ble the political Resident took effective measures against you in connection with your treatments with them and to check you from your oppressions towards them. You seem to have forgotten what happened to you in the -past. 0* ^ou Shaikh Humaid fear God and cease this policy v/hich will bring for you the displeasure of the Political Resident. You know that the diving business is the subject of treaties entered into by the Shaikhs of the Oman Coasts with the High British Government and you are in possession of the book of treaties. Your treatments however are violating the clauses of the treaties which concern diving, xhe crews are, with your permission, being lent money by the Al ^en Luta and now they have ran away to ±n other towns forfor th^ purposes of diving (for others) which v/ill cause losses to the Al Ban Luta who will lose their claims fron crews concerned According to rules a Shaikh cannot interfere in diving question between two parties hut in accordance with justice and yet you have interfered with the divers, /ou are aware that Al Ben Luta after the end -of last diving reason namely from the month of Safar- (September 102^) up to the month of Ramazan (April 1024) are advancing money and giving rice and dates to divers and although there are the dangers of plague in the Oman Coasts, yet they rely on the divers to work in their boats. If you do interferences for the purpose of causing losses to them you will, certainly, be responsible which is contrary to what is desirable, please accept my advice and give up croockedness and evil doing and walk in the path of goodness and rightnesn. Letter dated Oth riamazan (14-4-^4) from Shaikh Humaid ben Abdul Aziz to the Residency Agent, Shargah. I received your letter and understood what you have written therein. You stated that I have abused Ahmad ben Lutah. This is a mere accusation on his part and is unfounded and you are aware of the state of affairs between me and Ahmad. As regards the divers he can take thosa whom he wants and pay the dues of those whom are not wanted by him. As regards Al Hamrani they are usually treated like Ben Lutah and they pay taxes like foreigners I do not act in opposition to you and of this you should re3t assured . poor men are vnder yea r prot ct-V i.. x a . people now busy about diving.

Indeed I was astonished of your action as it is contrary to your letter to ne. It is undesirable for a chief like you to put uifjpy promises and make intrigues secretly and order the divers to go to diving with Halchodas other than their previous ^akhodas. However it appears from your machina tion in the business of the aforesaid persons that you intend to sDoil the due.J which they have on account of diV-ing. The best for you is to undertake the payment of all dues which they have in A.jman, whether it. being advances which are with you, the claims * /'hich are against the divers, bifcg and small, and also the sums due to them from your subjects. If so please let me know so that I may feend'a 1 'soecial man to settle their dues and to show you a list of their claims, iou should theft write the undertaking and I will represent it to the Uon'ble the Political Resident. If Al Ben Lutah agree to take noney and leave their dealing in diving I will recover the amount fron you. I do .not think that the political Resident agrees to your acoion against the subjects of the High British Government at a .Irian. a -re^ly is awaited.

The Ruler of Ajman sent his subjects to Shaikh Sultan bin Ssaar Puler of Shargah In order that he should recover their dues but this end was not nchieved because there exists an enmity between the headman of Hiraz namely Abdul Rahman bin Knhammad and the Pulcr of A.iman. as Abdur Rahman in 1920 jk' - entered the Ajman fort while the father of the present Ruler was the Shaikh of the place and was at that time saying nis prayers in his mosque. On this account lighting raged in Ajman for ten days.Abdur Rahman killed six persons of the citizens of Ajman shotting them from the fort.The Ruler of Ajman and h^ subjects wanted to set fire to the fort by means flaming trunks and leaves of date trees with a view to burning Abdur Rahman and his followers who were there^Then the news reached Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad who,at that time was the Ruler of Shargah,and he went to Ajmar and then they called me tbither. I went there and brought down the said Abdur Rahman from the gold fort. In this event the Ruler of Ajman lost/'ornaments and furniture worth Rs 3000/» which were existing in his iort» Since that year there exists a latent enmity between the Rulei ol Ajman and the said Abdur Rahman. : c At present the saia Aoaur Rahman has concentrated his mind upon the people of Ajman and whenever the Ruler of Ajman punishes a man or as necessary he/arrest# a man for the recov^ to vill age H i rah and of some claims affRi they run away/Aoaur liahman aiiords them claims ha-fl/oeen obtained for t J* f refuge.

They are diying claims against their subjects f ana Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr aid hie best to settle the cases between the people of Hira and the people of Ajman There remained only the question of manumitted slaves who are living at Hira and the Shaikh of Ajman wants to enslave them. The Shaikh of Shargah and Shaikh Abdur Rahman were not willing to help him in this respect because they are manumitted slaves. Their cases were once referred to tue Shara* at Dubai, but it was not proved that they were still under slavery. 6. The Shaikh of 'Ajman is digging out some old cases which took place at the time of his father the • Abdur Rahman Shaikh of Ajman and Shaikh bin Muhaamad in the month of July 1920 # which cases were settled by an order from Colonel Trevor the Political Resident.

He explained to you all that he wanted to sa^ about the case of the Shaikh of Ajman who made an attempt on the life of Shaikh 'Abdur Rahman bin Muhammad.

As far as I know tnere is an undertaking between you and Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, the Ruler of Shargah, according to khich the subjects of both of you can ply between Shargah and ^jman without an interference This action on ypur part is considered to be a breach of the peace existing between you and the Shaikhs of Ihe Coast in general.

I have also received letters from the Residency A^ent and Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad repectively. 2. As you are aware the British GoYernment will not interfere in the internal affairs of your principality unless there is danger to the life and property of British subjects or the subjects of friendly Foreign Governments. Where there is no such thing, the Residency Agent lias no authority to interfere in matters relating to war in ^jman. But as you ana Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad kntw it was not possible tor you ksoL to turn out T Abdur %hMi from the Port you asked the Residency Agent for his good offices. He, in compliance to you request proceeded to Ajman, but f Abdur Rahman refused to evacuate the Port without getting an undertaking from you for peace. It was but natural for Abdur Rahman to refuse before getting an undertaking from you and Shaikn Khlid nin Ahmad, th Ruler of Sliargah, countersigned by the Residebcy Agent to the aflect that he will be under safe-conduct and no one will inte -fere with him. 3. You bothegave an unaertaicing to the Residency Agent who in nis turn gave a safe conduct to 'Abaur ^hman on the force of the undertaking given to him by you. 'Abdur Rahman then evacuated the Port which was given back to you. 4. The promise given by you to 'Abdur ^ahinan for ^eace ' and the protection of the lives and properties of f Abdur Rahman and his followers was made through the Residency Agent Therefore 1 expect from you that you will fulfill your promise and will not failto comply with it or try to craate any troub to ? Abdir Rahman or his followers. I do not agree tnat you u , * . . with the . should fail to comply with yannc promise contained in your letter. 5. According to your letter you seem to deny having asked the Residency Agent to help you and it is bo worded After Compliments, I received your letter dated Shauv;al about theit conveys the meanin^; tnat you coiisiaer it to be an interfer ence from the Residency Agent by which he meai t to help 'Abdur -i^ahinan. 6. The Residency Agent had only interfered in the aatter when he receivea your letter dated the ii7th Ebmadhan, to which your attention is invited, in which you requested him to proceed to Ajman and concluded your letter by saying' ?or the sake of God, I ask you, the fatner of ^bdur %aaian, to do me favour for which I pray God to reward you'. Because you beleive that God will compensate him that is why you do L.ot want to be bound by your promise. Tne Residency Agent had saved at time of difficulties and now you want to deny the assurance and the undertakings given by you. As the Residency Agent had given these undertakings I do not agree tnat should iail to ooaiply with them, whatever your rules ana customs might be, these they will be subject to these terms. 7. As regards the gold anu other things «hicn you allege to have be taken away, I see no stipulation by which the Residency ^gent undertook to get them for you. Besides it is not part of his duty to uo so. On the contrary you asked him in your letter dated the 3rd ^hauwal to recover thebe for you. He, as a matter of favour, recovered all that wuich 'Abdur Rahman and uis followers admitted to nave been found on the man who was going to Dubai. I therefore wish to advice you to accept them without further arguments. 8. In conclusion I may add that you uo no appear to stick to your promise. In order to avoid further trouble I agree, however, ihat T AbdurR|Jahiaan and nis followers should not live in their house, though realy speaking this should not be done, because you have promised them peace and safety and in the absence of a condition to the contrary they can live.

The Shaikh also sent me a letter enclosing a letter from some of the Uwamir bedouins who are now staying with the Shaikh of 'Ajman to the effect that the they have cancelled t their pledges and would declare war agEinst him with the Shaikh of 'Ajman. 3. The Shaikh of Shar^ah has ho desire to declare war against 'Ajman but wants to refer the matter to you so that you may not blame him should any fight takes place betwean him and the Shaikh of 'Ajman. 4* Shaikh Sultan is very much disappointed at this matter. I told the Shaikh of Shargah verbally that he should not indulge in a war until I refer the matter tpjyou. 5# In my opinion there will be lot of bloodshed and plunder accompanied by raids if war takes place between them which is not a good thing. 6. It would be a good thing if you conbider it desire -able to take some action which shuts the door of war.

As God, however, wanted to save his life Shaikh ♦Abdur Rahman received xs a warning about the plot and tnus took some other way on his way back. 2. Last year he(Shaikh of 'Ajman) sent some armed men by night in order to attack him but as the guards of Shaikh 'Abdur Rahman were on their watch they exchanged shots with them as a result of which they returned unsuccessful. 3. Recently on Friday the 4:th current Rabi' atha Thani (i.e.28.7.33) Rashid bin Humaid sent three men hamed 'Auwas, his servant, Rashid bin Khusaif and Muhatamad bin Mubarak who to Hira where they declared themselves to be guests who had some business. 4. As soon as they reached the gate of She house of Shaikh T Abdur Rahman bin Muhammad they asked to see him. He accordingly came out to see them but as soon as he approached them and wanted to s^ake hands with them they fired three shots at him. But, as God wanted to save him so that iie may live longer his body was not injured although the bullets pearced his clothes. 5. These are the activities of Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid who does not respect the tresties and pledges whicfthail the nations respect. 6. I did not mention this to you before when he used to intrigue secretly, but as he is now doing his attacks and murders at the day light I mention this to you for your inform- ion.- 2 - 7. I am p»»plexed at the opposing act o f this person who excite and intrigues in order to create sedition. 8. I informed you of this because the consquences of his activities will het 'be in the interest of the all the Oaan side. 9. I am able to retaliate and declare war against him but as the fight requires the collecting of bedouins, I, for the sake of the aerodrome and my desire for calmness and peace and in order not to ditturb the residents and the passengers, want to acqaint you with the activities of the said person and to rquest you to let me have a reply so that I may take the necessary steps. 10^1 also like to know the opinion of the Government about this man who commits these£crimes.
