After being delayed for some little time on the way owing to radiator trouble, and shortly after meeting a car from Zubair which had come tnrough without incident, his car arrived at Sna‘iD Abu Saham, the tnird large ww.tercourse in the Abatih tract at I p.m* Here they suddenly came on the raiders in two parties: one of about twenty camels with two men on each to their left, and a much larger party in front of them, which was too far off for them to estimate its strength accurately. The p^rty on their left opened fire on them, but the driver got the car round, and they escaped without injury and returned to Kuwait. A regrettable incident took place later the s me after noon some ten miles further to the north when a party of Americans, consisting of Mr. Charles R. Crane lformerly United States Minister in PeKln), his son Hid X American valet, and Mr. Henry Bil*ert ^of the uaerican Mission in Basrah) who were proceeding to Kuwait in two cars, were fired on by a party of mounted raiders, presumably their advanced guard. The two oars wheeled and made for Zubair as fast as they could, but Mr. Bilkert was hit and died before reaching Zubair. It appears extraordinary how this party ventured along the road in view of the warnings which they received, as they were apparently told in Zubair that It was dangerous,* they met a taxi which had been sent out to warn the shep herds, as the result of a telegram from the Shaikh of Kuwait, on its way back to Zubair; they even saw shepherds driving their flocks in, and actually heard firing - and still went on. The raiding party, which apparently consisted of about a hundred and fifty camel riders and forty horsemen of the * AJman, Mutair and Rashaidah tribes under Dhaidan al- Hithlain and Ibn Lami, are reported to have killed six otherReference paragraph of Diary No.!? of 1928, Dr. J* C people besides Mr* Bilkert, and to have t&gt;ot aw iy with ^ver six hundred sheep* They aqsiui bivouacked between Siddah and Umm Ruus, to the south-west of Jahrah, on the evening of the ^&lt;ind January, after sending, on the plundered sheep, :^nd left at dawn on the 4jr&amp;, some hours before the pursuing armoured cars reached there, hoping to reach Ma’raJ as-Sauoan that night. There ere indications that further raids are to be ex pected, and, as the *Ir^q tribes are naturally alarmed,many conflicting rumours are current. As a matter of fact the situation in Najd is extremely obscure, and the various rumours differ so that it is very difficult to sift the truth from the falsehood* There can be little doubt, however, that the relations between Ibn Sa’iid and the Ikhw£n leaders are becoming more and more strained, and his task of preventing them from attacking the 'Iraq Desert Posts ia becoming harder from day to day* He has even found it necessary to issue orders for Jubail, Qatff, etc*, to oe fortified. On the other hand there are indications that consider able ill-feeling exists between Ibn Humaid and Ibn Rubai'an, the two most powerful shaikhs of the great 'Utalbah tribe, which, if true, is all to the good, as it will militate against concerted action on the part of the tribe against 1 Iraq. According to information available in Kuwait, although troubles are certainly to be expected, it is probable that Faisal ad-Dawfsh at any rate has not yet moved from his headquarters* The French Admiralty Yacht M Diana' arrived from Basrah on the 2?rd January, and her Commanding Officer, as also the French Consul at Bushlre who was on board, called on the Political Agent and on His Excellency the Shaikh the same afternoon, both of which calls were returned on the morning of the 24th, shortly after which the Yacht left for Bushire* \—No * ^ of 1 • KUWAIT NEWS FOR THE PERIOD FROM 1st TO Ijth MARCH ARRIVALS &amp; DEPARTURES OF SHIPS. 27.

A Victoria aeroplane arrived at Kuwait from Baghdad on the Hth March, bringing a field wireless set and two operators for the use of the Special Service Officer during his stay in Kuwait. The aeroplane returned to Shu'aibah Aerodrome the same day. Similar aeroplanes also visited Kuwait on the I3th and fbth March. LOCAL INTERESTS. ti j 0 Considerable excitement was caused la Kuwait on morning of the 3rd March by heavy firing oeing heard a short distance outside the town wall to the south-west of the town. It transpired that forty tenia of the Bani Mali&amp;, an ’Iraq shepherd tribe whose summer range is in the neigh bourhood of Basrah and Zubalr, had been attacked at dawn that morning by a party of some six hundred MUtair raiders under Ibn Shuqair and Fuqm near J’ Ifb ash-Shuyukh, barely eight miles from Kuwait, where they were encamped.The shep herds put up a stout fight, and endeavoured to withdraw to Kuwait, but, with the exception of barely a thousand sheep and a few donkeys, lost ail their animals, to the number of over six thousand sheep and six hundred and fifty donkeys. Thirty of tne families lost all their belougiiigs. The raiders made off with their plunder towardsthe south, but were cau&amp;ht by British aircraft later in the day about twenty miles from Kuwait near ^arah, nd were attacked with machine £,uns and bombs. The raiders subjected the aircraft to very heavy rifle fire, and unfortunately killed one wireless operator, \fter the action the raiders proceeded to retreat as rapidly as they could towards the south* The Ban! Lulik lost twenty seven aea Allied and died of wounds, and five others were severely wounded* The Ikhwan casualties ?.re not Known accurately, .*» tney carried some of their dead and all their wounded away with them,but they were probably almost as high as those of the shepherds. Ten Ikhwan at least &amp;re known to h^ve been buried on the field after the morning’s fighting. Including Sha’af bln Laos! who was a cousin of Shuraiyln bln Larai, and a Kuwait p trol car which was watching the bombing from a distance saw at least three men hit* The people of Kuwait treated the destitute tribes men very Kindly, and got up a subscription f r their relief which was generously responded to. /then it was proposed to evacuate them by sea, khan Sahib 'Abdul Latif bin ‘Abdul Jalll, tne Lirector of Customs, at once put his private sailing boat at their disposal fully rationed with drinking water for the voyage free of charge. He also gave most valuable assistance in arranging for their embarkation and despatch. Eventually some hundred and fifty refugees sailed from Kuwait tx for the Khuwalr late on the Uth March. The remainder left by road with their animals on the &lt;4th with an escort of ’Iraq Police cars, to Join the main concentra tion of ’Iraq tribes in northern Kuwait. On the 3th March Muhammad ash-Shuraitl was raided by the Buraih Mutair in the Kuwait portion of the ohaiq, while on Jtk* his way to Join £bn Bail. He is said to have lost a considerable number of camels.

The Police opened fire with two Lewis £&gt;uns, icllling three aen and wounding bthers, and then returned northwards, followed for soae distance by the horsemen. The above were not the only Instances of lawless ness which took place in Kuwait during the fortnight. The Shaikh of Kuwait told the Political Agent that two of this tribesmen had been robbed when hawking &lt;and collecting . truffles in the Qara’ al-Marru on the 6th Larch by two aen of the Jawarln, and that another had been robbed near the Shaqq on the saae day by the same two Jawarln; and asaed hia to take the natter up with the ’Iraq Authorities.fcaptaln J. 3. Glubb, C.B.S*, L.C., Administrative Inspector of the Southern Desert of ’Iraq who is in charge of the ’Iraq tribes now in Kuwait territory, suanoned the Jawarfn con cerned, who admitted having taken their arns, etc. - but not all the articles claimed - from the two men in the ^ara* al-&amp;arru, but denied having t?^ken anything froa the other aan. In the first case their excuse was that the Kuwait tribesmen had insulted them, an exchange of abuse had ensued and they had finally lost their tempers. Japtain Glubb Is returning the articles w&amp;ich they acknowledge having taxen, and has sugt,®«t»eU that the plaintiffs be a. xed if they are prepared to swear in respect of tne others. On the afternoon of the Hth March two flocks of sheep, numbering about five hundred all told, belonging to two Kuwait tribesmen who were camped on the Mutla’, Just to the north of Jahrah, were carried off by a party of horse men belonging to the Zaiyad tribe of ’Iraq. Subsequent en quiries made by Captain Glubb show that both parties mis took the others for raiders #nd fired, and the Zaiyad say that they carried off the sheep under the impression thattheir owners were hut-ir# J^ptain QXudo has arranged Tor the return of the ania&amp;ia to their owners and for any deficient cies to be aade £ood, and has had three of the Zaiy&amp;d who were chiefly responsible arrested. \ report has also been received that two camels were stolen from a camp of the ’Uraibdar at Atraf, ei^ht niles west south-west of Jahrah, on the night of the 14/ffjth harch. xn the ^o.-ning the owner followed their traces, which led them to where the 'Iran tribes are encamped in the ^ara* arru. On seeing this he returned and reported the matter to the Shaiith.

The •Ajman, who had all along been opposed to Dhaidai putting himself in Fahd bin Jiluwi’s power, were much in censed when they received news of what had happened,particu larly as they wrongly interpreted a volley which was heard from Fahd’s camp shortly after phaidan’s arrest as phaidan’i execution. A force started off at once and attacked and stormed Fahd bin Jiluwi 1 s camp in the early hours of 1st May* When Fahd saw that the fight was lost, he went with his own personal following to the tent where phaidan was lying andand had him shot.

The rebel Ajman under Naif al-Hithlain are still camped in the vicinity of Wafrah, a good watering place south of Kuwait Territory ant in the Southern Neutral Zone. With the Ajman are Ibn Mashur of the Ruwalla branch of the Anazah, and also some Ataiba elements. The fighting strength of the whole is only about 10'0 to &amp; 1200 men. The forces of Ibn Sa*ud are reported to be at the following places watching events for the moment. All have strict orders to make no move till the King arrives from Hijaz. (a) The Awazim with a small Hasa contingentsent tiy Ibn Jalo«i at al-Masekh north-east of K'ta. (h) Sa*u&lt;l al-Ahlul A?i?&gt; (the King’s son) at Ghatghat with 500 men. (c) Ihn Jalowi al-Haffuf with some 700 men. (d) Ihn Mu’saad Amir of Hail at Shaiba, east of Hail with 3000 men. (e) Loyal lutair elements (Hraih) al-Hafar al- Batin west of Jahrah (Kuwait). Adherents of Ibn Sa*ul in Kuwait are of opinion that the King will shortly come to Kajd and attempt to disperse the rebels at once. Experienced persons say that the King will not attempt any operations for at least months owing to the great heat in the desert. The Ruler of Kuwait is also of this opinion - he also thinks, and this view is supported by the King* s Agent in Kuwait, that the King will spend the next 3 months trying to detach various sections of the Ajman by offers of amnesty. While pro Ibn Sa*ud elements in Kuwait talk of nothing else but the com ing attack of Ibn Sa'ui and the final crushing of those rebels still out against him; others who may be called the anti-Ibn Sa'ulites, and they are many, are spreading stories of grave and far reaching dis content against the King. The whole of the northern Akhwan are definitely out against him, they say. The Ataiba, in particular and the followAirg of Ibn Rubaian are reported to be merely awaiting the signal from 'Wafrah* to break out. They are reported to have already started trouble in the Hidjaz. The/ cause of the universal discontent is said to be the AxkxM treachery of Fahad in Hasa and of Ibn Sa’ud himself at '3ibilla w previously. The story goes that on both occasions the ieiowin were given the'oath of Ood' that. no harm should come to them if they came in. While it is difficult to separate the truth from the false, it would appear certain that a clash is not far distant between Ibn Sard's forces and the recalcitrant Ajman.4 ('2.o\\ r\rs&gt;^ ■ These latter Ihn Sa’ul cannot affori to leave in open rehellion; as the sore is if not lealt with will most certainly spread. As it is many Bedowin are sitting on the m tenc.^ m waiting to see how events will end. In the mean time the Buler of Kuwait, at the request of the British Government, has forbidden any Ajman or followers of Ihn M«shur to enter Kuwait territory, and has put a very strict embargo on all supplies going out to them. This in spite of the fact that mischief makers both in Kuwait and in Najd state this is not so. The Ruler of Kuwait has gone further and in answer to appeals for food help from the Ajman has sternly warned them to give up their foolishness and submit to their rightful King. M Their only course,' he has advised them, 'is to beg for forgiveness. The door is still open' • METEOROLOGICAL . 64. Reference paragraph 51 of diary No.8 of 1929.

(a) On the 1st June the Political Agent reported that a messenger from Shaikh Naif al-Bumaid, one of the let ters of the great Ataiba tribe in Nejdi 1 ■ ° a refugee in Baghdad and receives a monthly stipend fx H.B. King Faisal) had arrived at lafrah. the head quarters of the AJman rebels. The messenger was report ed locally to have brought eacourAging news from Baghda 6.5. 'C hakla” S.S .^Barpeta' 5.5.

The story was probably false, but is interesting as an example of the excellent spy system that Bln 9aud maintains in Kuwait for immediately following the Political Igent’s report came a strong protest from Bln Saud informing His Majesty 9 s Government of the visit of Naif al-Humaid's cousin to the rebels, and accusing Baghdad of collusion. (b). during the period under review, more strong protestcfrom bin 3aud accusing Kuwait of sending food am ammunition to the Ajman rebels were forthcoming. These resulted in the Political Agent instituting further most careful enquiries, the result of which were reported to the Hon'ble the Political Besiient in the Persian Gulf, Jushire. That a certain amount of secret smuggling exists through the medium of relatives and well wishers of the Ajman who reside in Kuwait, cannot be denied but that the Thiler of Kuwait allows supplies to be purchased and sent out openly is entirely contrary to the facts. The Shaikh of Kuwait has and is loyally doing his utmost to carry out the wishes of His Mnjestyds Government in the matter, and has not only forbidden the sale of any food stuffs to any of the Ajman rebels but has refused to allow any camels or a single rebel to cross his border for the purpose. As a check ana to insure that his orders are being carried out, he has allowed only one gate, and this under strict guard, to be used for the export of any foodstuffs from the town. The onus of proving that the supplies are not destined for the rebeli falls on the exporter. (e). On the 4th June the Political Agent reported a raid close to Jahra resulting in the loss of 100 camels used by Kuwait wood •cutters. The raiders were all of the i&gt;hafir Tribe, subjects Xof 9 Iraq one of theraiders was captures nad fcae gives the names and lea&lt;lere of the party. The matter is under isvestigatioa hy the 'Iraq authorities. (*) H.E. tba Ruler of Kuwait again offioially put fomarq. his ohjectios to 'Iraq police cars enter ing his territory. A full report of the conversation which the political Agent ha* *ith the Shaikh was suhmitteA in this office No.0.386 date* the 14th June 1929. (e) . On the 14th June it was reliably reported that a large force of Ajman raiders had started from Wafra for the Couth. Their destination *as entirely unknown, and the move was kept secret. It is supposed the objective is either Jubail or ftntif though it is more probable that the force intends seizing a more southemly positioa aear water for its comiag forward move against Ibn Jaloui. (f) .Cn the 9th June a message was received from the Hon'ble the Political Resideat in the Persian Gulf, lushire, to the effect that Kuwait was being accused of supplying arms of iritisn make to Persiaa rebels. The matter is being carefully gone into by the Political Agent and the Shaikh. It is highly probable that the story is merely a fiction and 'Canard* raised by the local Persian officials to account for their lack of success agaiast the Qashgai tribesmea at Shlras. The unsettled state of Arabia today more specially in the north along the Kuwait and 'Iran border has givea aa exagerated value to all rifles, far from wanting to 8e m rifles, the contrary is the care sad tribesmen and Arabs generally are all out to arm themselves *ith the best weapons and ammunition available.

His Excel lency nas not been deceived by such flattering offers and goes his own way steadily enforcing the bioojfisde. ^ 2 . During the period under review two very satisfactory matters were settled, both of whioh gave gre*t satisfaction to the Ruler ana it is hoped will greatly improve the feeling between the neighbouring states of ’Iraq and Kuwait. (a) His Excellency the High commissioner for ’Iraq instruct— *d the Ministry of Interior to prevent further visits of ’Iraq Desert polio© into Kuwait territory. This did not r.f.r to tn. existing gfjwafxIsmKK loosing sft.r th« 'Dhafir' at ^afwan, who however were warned to provide immediate protection and not to move far afield.(to) Tii© inspecting officer of police, Salmon, Major Buttdtph was able to recover and band back a number of camels whioii bad been raided from Kuwait wood cutters by tbe Dbafir and Sbamooar pome time back. Gratitude far out of proportion to tbe importance of tbe affair itself was wKiaiMiixa evinced by tbe people of Kuwait, wbo looked upon it ©p a test case, and oboee to see in tbe result © very friendly gesture from ^raq.. IbiF of course is very satis factory. 93. on 15th July the political Agent was able to report tbe evacuation by tbe insurgents of We fra ana tbe move south to Najirs and Hamudb of tbe whole of tbe Ajman, Mutair ©no Ibn M©tnor con tingents. This tbe political Agent considers was largely cue to ) tbe untiring efforts of His Excellency tbe Puler whose object has all along been to move tbe rebels away from frontier, and tbe standing temptation of Subabiyeb. It is improbable that tbe rebels will move further south at pre- sent, as grazing for camels is bad round Nta end inis grazing «nd water question is what will affect operations against more tbe rebels by Bin Saud week than anything else. It is oonfidentlj expected therefore that nothing of importance in tbe nature of '’fighting' will take place for another 2 to 3 months. Grazing' and 'water' are today tbe masters in Nejd' as tbe Arab says. 94. on 18th tbe political Agent reported t^at small parties of Ajman raiders bad reached as far as Bemban Ain and Seed wa i^mlan all three places quite close to Rieth. One shoula bear shortly of many more such raids, as tbe avowed object of Ad-Duwish is by continual raids into Nejd and Aaretffc, to cause so much insecurity and demoralizetion as will force every one i who 1?

'There is danger in this method of course, but it would seem that for the ioaent Bin Saud ideally ims lost control of the majority of tribes in Hojd and carmot do otherwise. It is significant that I bn Ashwan evidently decided that the situation was thoroughly bad for the King, as immediately on return to his tribe, he wont over to the insurgents with his tribe. Another significant fact and one which perhaps influenced Ibn Ashwan in his decision more than anything else was that his riding camels which were stabled in Bin Saud^ own palace at Hath, were removed by robbers and no efforts were xaade to recover them or imrsuo the marau ders. From other sources come similar tales of Bin Baud 1 3 apparent apathy, but these must all be taken with caution ^ as emanating from anti Bin Gaud elements. The writer’s opinion is still that Bin baud will do nothing till the weather cools, and events are merely bearing out this view. At the same thue, and as stated before there seems little doubt that everything depends on the / taiba. Both Bin Saud and tn© puwish are striving to get these definitely on to their respective sides, that their efforts will result in, remains to bo seen. (b).

The offici al mentioned has probably been confused with Turhi bin • Abdul •Asia al Ithaar (a distiuit connection of Bin Sa'xui'a)* This person is in south Eassa^ collecting Eassa and Qatif tribal ele ments who, it is intended, should march north to reinforce the *Awazim. (d) At Hafar al *Atz there is still no sign of a serious concentration of Bin sa«ud» 8 forces through pro-bin Saud^ pro- pagandxsts insist that the ridiculous figure of 100 standards are camped there. probably a few Sbei and SJdxool olesnonts arc guarding the wells and acting as ne?ws-colleetors for Bin 3a*ud. At the same tins Bafar—al ’Ata wells are good ones, and if Bin Sa'ud has any spare troops in Mejd, which does not seen liLely, in view of the trouble in Qassini and throughout the ♦Ataiba country, these wells would offer a useful jumping off place for a force entering Haesa* (o) Ibn Uusa»ad is still at •Ajlbba at the tine of writing* His inactivity is i&gt;uzsling, unlOGs Bin Sa , ud , s object in keeping him thoi'e is to cut off oomnunleatlon betv/een tiie forces of Al Duwish in lass a and tne insurgent •; taiba west of passim. There are ranours that 'ShasBaar' are being got at by Duwish and that Signs of unrest among them are daily becoming more evident .As ibn Muaa'ad's fox-cos consist largely of 'Sharsmr* he will Have to novo vfitli caic if x-uaaux-s arc tx-uc.

That the latter is a politician and is pulling strings throughout Arabia and ia perfectly obvious. ilia first nove of driv~ I lag them away from kk® Hejd liaving been successful, what more natural than to bring influences to bear to get then over to his side with the promise of Hail and a Ba&amp;ohld chieftain again. (g) The more one watches i aisai Duwiah f s policy the more it j is clear that he is out to try and break the power of Bin Sa’ud for good. lie believes that it was tiie Ikhwan who made Bin Sa r ud and by their means he feels he can break the King’s power again* Tor the moment xniwish’s objective is to ramove the ’Awasiza menace in Husaa. This tribe is very slowly moving elooer and cloeer to the area in north Hass a whore the nut air and Ikhv/an generally have concentrated their camel wealth and women folk. Al Buwish has on two definite occasions sont warnings to the *Awaaim to retire, as he has no quarrel with them, and wants to move into Hejd and there fight Bin S a ’ad. The ’Awasim how- are over some or Bin Sa*uu’s moot staunch cluronts and have obstinate AT ly refused Buwish’s advances with scorn. Obviously al puwish will be forced to gigat them soon, and I do not think the result can be in doubt for Buuish has shorn him self to be a strategist and tactician or no mean order. (h) From letters from Bin Sa’ud to His Excellency Sheikh Ahmed and several otner K u wait notables, it is pretty clear reading between the lines, that the King is occupied trying to put down a rebellion in Kejd proper, especially in Qasslm* Al Duwish knov^rs this and is anxious to proceed to Hojd and add to the difficulties of an already serious situation for the King. U) The stories that overwhelming forces are converging at Ilassa to deal with Al Buwiah auid his rebels mroat be treated as myths therefore. All indications show^ that Bin Sa’ud is on the defensive, and apai't from the ’Awuaim and their sillies, hoaction to be taKen to counter such raid In tho opinion of the oil 4 * ctil jvgent a good case was made out for the lino, i nd ao •Its :ccol 1 onoy guaranteed to find tJio money, the project wdb for warded and b trosoglgr roc croton dad to the Lon’blo the 1 olitlC'l resident» tiae training of Mb woollency the dielkh’e ^liouel” LewlB Cun crer In ikisiuh. o man will pi'oceeC . on or about the loth IJoversoer and. will receive their trainix^ at the hands of une was finally settled and accepted by the helkiu ho ar riv il of tli© Guns is now awaited with keenness* 102* (a) During the period under i evict? tfie oiltlcal n jBnt re- oelvod t'o lettors from Ms - aj ©sty the l ing of 11©jd and ' odjas.

The date of Sir Khazaal Khan f s letter had also been altered in the same hand, /hen confronted with the original office- copy, Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif broke down and admitted his guilt. In view of his long and faithful services under 4 rulers, the Jhaikh allowed him to make out a fresh promisory note which was given to Khan Bahadur 1'irza i Kohamed, and in which Khan Bahadur bdul Latif not only acknowledged the debt but agreed to pay it back in instal ments of Ea 8,000/- a year, (b( It is possible that the Shaikh would have allowed the matter to pass and have hushed up the scandal,- had not another case of fogcry been proved against the Director of Customs immediately after the above incident, A matter of £ 3200 was involved in this new case and the enquiry was conducted by a committee of the leading mar chants of Kuwait by order of the Ruler,-3- Apparently the Director of Customs had some two years previously lent one Hamad al-iiaqr a rich pearl merchant £ 3200 but the money had been paid back, entries had been duly made in Hamad al-3aqr f s account booka, and the receipt had been filed* Hamad al-Saqr recently died, and the Director of Customs informed the executors that before the man *s death, he had again given him the ori ginal £ 3200 for safe keeping and held his receipt and now v/anted his money# ’This receipt was easily proved to be a forgery by the examining committee, who were able to show: - (a) that the signature was not in the hand writing of the dead man; (b) that whereas ail known documents signed by the dead man were signed 'Hamad al- siaqor', that produced was signed Hamad bln Abdullah al-CaqaT*. (c) That the dead m£n t s clerk himself had confessed that he had written out the supposed receipt end given it to the Customs Director in the life time of his master as an example of how re ceipts should be draflpi up, though he had~never entered the name of his principal, nor written any amount on the document# In this case also, when confronted with the facts, the Khan Bahadur confessed that he had been tempted and had committed forgery# (c) The Shaikh on receiving a full report of the affair decided to get rid of Customs Director at once# The latter has now retired into private life, a disgraced and broken man# (d) As so often happens in such oases, many other creditors have now come forward with their claims, and the nuler is busy examining them# As the latter comes first with 21,000/- due to him on account of a loan, it i© probable that five of the accused*s houses in Kuwait will be shortly seized and sold by the State to help pay the debts.
