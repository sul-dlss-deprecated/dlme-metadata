Buff clay, white slip ground covered with clear glaze. Overglaze decoration in olive luster. Bearded cavalier with turban and large shield, adorned with a crescent in left hand. A rabbit trots alongside the horse and rider through palmette vines. The rider's foreshortened foot, his intense sideward gaze, and the scarf or turban end trailing out behind him all illustrate the earthly vitality of this piece.

Although this object was produced in Egypt during the period of the Fatimid dynasty (909&ndash;1171), luster was first developed as a decorative technique for ceramics in Iraq in the ninth century. The technology was also used in Syria and Iran between the eleventh and fifteenth centuries, and was revived in Iran in the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century. Surviving Fatimid Egyptian examples of lusterware were likely excavated at the site of Fustat (Old Cairo) in the early part of the twentieth century. These often display high-quality draftsmanship in the rendition of both humans and animals, quite similar to architectural and manuscript painting of the period.<br />", "summary": null, "rank": 0, "label_date": "2008-11-05", "date_added": "2008-11-05 10:02:36", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 20, "name": "Arts of the Islamic World", "folder": "arts_of_the_islamic_world", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [{"id": 1000, "title": "Curator's Choice: Islam in Africa"}], "related_items": [], "geographical_locations": [{"id": 8606427, "name": "Fustat, Egypt", "type": "Place found"}], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "86.227.83_top_PS1.jpg", "id": 10984, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/86.227.83_top_PS1.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/86.227.83_top_PS1.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 96, "height": 80}, {"size": "1", "width": 192, "height": 161}, {"size": "2", "width": 384, "height": 322}, {"size": "3", "width": 768, "height": 645}, {"size": "4", "width": 1536, "height": 1291}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/86.227.83_top_PS1.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": null, "caption": " <em>Fragment of a Bowl Depicting a Mounted Warrior</em>, 11th century.
