A., HIS MAJESTY’S CONSUL AT AHWAZ, t 1910 . SIMLA* PRINTED AT THE GOVERNMENT MONOTYPE PRESS. 1911.NOTES ON THE KUHGALU. The Kuhgalu or Kuhgalui, as they are sometimes called, find a meaning for their appellation in the derivation “ Kuh-i-Gilui ” or the “ Dwellers of the earth hillsThey are, for the greater part, nomads like their neigh bours the Bakhtiaris, with the difference, however, that their annual migra tions are much shorter than those of their neighbours, and are often re stricted to moving from the valley bottoms to the upper mountain slopes. They are sub-divided into tribes and sub-tribes, given in detail later, which are often separated by bitter and implacable blood-feuds. The Kuhgalu are infinitely better armed and physically are a finer race than their neighbours the Bakhtiaris or the tribes who inhabit Western Luristan. In looks, they are living images of the figures which are found in the rock carvings in their country, both in features, mode of dressing their hair and, to a great extent, their clo hing. They are wild and lawless, most notably the Taiyibi, who have gained an unenviable notoriety in connection with their depredations on the Lynch Road (Ahwaz to Isfahan via the Bakhtiari Country) and appear, to some extent, to have recovered from the merciless visitation of Farhad Mirza, who was Governor-General of Fars up to 1882. They are sprung, in all probability, from the original Lur stock, but who they were, whence they came, is merely a matter of conjecture, for they are a people without a written history, without a literature, uneducated, and with but few tribal traditions. The mode of life and habits of the Kuhgalu are even more primitive, and their Chiefs have even less of the veneer of civilization than those of Western Luristan. Their arts and crafts are few and primitive and are described later under the tribal headings. Their administration is of the patriarchal form, common to all tribes of the Lur stock ; their form of taxation, which is light, is dealt with in detail under the various tribal head ings. With regards to the country inhabited by the Kuhgalu, the summer and winter quarters of the various sub-tribes are dealt with in detail in their respec tive places, but it may be here generally stated that they occupy the country sduth of the Bakhtiari country, the northern boundary of which is contermin ous with the southern Bakhtiari boundary, which is situated a few miles south of that bend of the Karun River at the eastern end of which Burs is situated. On the south, the boundary is conterminous with that of the country inhabited by the Ka'b Arabs while on the east and west the boundaries march with those of the Mamasanni and the Arabs of Arabistan respectively. The Kuhgalu country is drained by two large rivers, viz. the Kami and the Jarrahi, i.e., by the two principal feeders of the latter, viz. the Ab-i-A’la and the Rudkhaneh-i-MaruiL The principal feeders of the Karun, which flow C030GSB2 through Kuhgalu territory are the Ab-i-Burs and the Rudkhaneh-i-Gandum. The Ab-i-ATa rises on the eastern slopes of the Mangasht, and after draining the country to within a few miles of Dishmuk falls eventually into the Rud-i- Zard, of whose waters it supplies the greatest part. The basin of the Rudkhaneh-i-Marun is entirely Kuhgalu territory, and, roughly speaking, we may say that Dishmuk, 6,500' above the sea level, is situated at the water-parting of these two systems. The mountain system of the Kuhgalu country resembles that of western Luristan and the Bakhtiari country, of which latter it is a continuation, the general strike of the chains being N. N. W. and S. S. E. The composition of the main ranges is crystalline limestone, while the outlying hills, situated between the plains of the Arab country and the main ranges proper, are the barren gatch formation, which is so commonly met with in a similar position all along the border of the plains right up as far as Mandali on the Turkish border. The climate of the Kuhgalu country resembles that of the Bakhtiari country m being hot in the low country in the - summer (as high a temperature as 124° in the shade having been registered in midsummer) and temperate in the winter. In the high country, the temperature is equable in the summer, but extremely cold in the winter. I will now proceed to deal with the Kuhgalu tribes in detail. Main sub-divisions. The Kuhgalu are sub-divided into two main subdivisions, viz {a) the Chehai Banicheh and ( 6 ) the Liravi. These again themselves are sub-divided as follows :— (a) Chehar Banicheh, sub-divided into:— Buvair Ahmad. Dushman Ziari. Churam. Nuyi. ' Bavi. ( 6 ) Liravi, sub-divided ihto :— Bahmai. Taiyibi /Sarhadi. [Garmsiri. Yusufi. Khadiri. Agha Jari. These tribes are also divided according to their habitat into (a) Pusht-i- Kuh and (b) Zir Kuh, the former of which consists of the Bavi, Buvair Ahmad, Nuyi, Dushman Ziari, while the latter or ‘ ‘ Zir Kuh ’ ’ consists of Agha Jari. JaghtaL Liravi. Churam, Taiyibi Sarhadi, Taiyibi Garmsiri, Bahmai, Inhabitants of Behbehan. „ Zaidan. „ Humajat.Bagdili. Jam-i-Buzurgi. Lur Zabau. Gasbtil. Daudi. Khushdasi. Cheh vr Banicheh. We will now deal with the Chehar Banicheh sub-tribes (a) Buvair Ahmad. Tribal tradition says that they are descended from Malik-ut-Tujjar, Che ^ ar Isfahani. One of their best known and most powerful chiefs was Karim .® 1 Khan, who died in 1907. Since then the tribe has been split up, each faction V Ahma d). following a different leader, with the inevitable result that the various factions are constantly at war with each other. In the autumn of 1909 the tribe was split up as follows :—part with Shukr- ullah Khan, part with the lineal descendants of Karim Khan, part with Qaid Muhammad Ali, and the remainder with Mulla Kubad. Of these, Shukrullah Khan’s following is the largest; but the actual strength of the various factions is constantly changing, as one petty chief changes his allegiance from one to the other. As a tribe, they are brave and warlike and make good fighting men, besides owning much land and, for Iliat, being wealthy. Most of the fruit which sup plies the Behbehan market is grown in their territories. The following table shews the subdivisions (Lur : Task) into which the Buvair Ahmad are split up :— Ta Muradi (Lur : Ta or Tataa, brother). Aghai. Kagavai. Sesakhti. Tas Ahmadi. Juzari. Shaikh-i-Mamu. Kurrai. Karra i. Sardaki. Badluni. Sar Kuhaki. Shaikh-i-AbiL Tarmaji. Aulad-i-Mirza Ali. Dasht-i-Mauri. Sar Chuti. Saiyid-i-Baba Muhammadi. Amalajat. The Buvair Ahmad, in all, number 4,500 families and are capable of put ting about 2,000 horsemen and 3,000 footmen, well mounted and we armed, into the field. ~ Boundaries of land inhabited by :-Ludab, Sat Rud, Rudkhaneh-i-Sa’dat, Sa’adat-i-Shaikh Abil.5 Arts and Crafts of :—The women of the tribe weave coarse woollen carpets che^a,. B an i. and gilims from wool produced by their own flocks, the dyes being obtained c h e h (Buvair from the trade marts mentioned above. Unfortunately, however, the Ahmad), practice of using an adm’xture of aniline with fast dyes is on the increase, to the detriment of the industry concerned. The women also weave coarse woollen wrappings (Lur : Khur) about 9' 6' by 3', which are used chiefly for sewing up into sacks for the transport of grain, etc. The black goats hair cloth, used exclusively in the construction of their tents, is also woven by the women and girls of the tribe usually in lengths of about 20' by 3'. Crafts found among the tribe are few and of the very simplest nature, the most common being that of the blacksmith, with here and there an armourer or a carpenter. Each sub-division has its own ‘‘ medicine man.” It is impos sible to concede to them the title of ‘ ‘ Doctor ’ ’ for their attainments in the therapeutic art are as uncouth as they are themselves, such little knowledge as they may have acquired being looked on as a hereditary possession. Taxation of :—4,000 tumans per annum is the total tribal contribution, paid into Behbehan, to the, Central Government. The internal taxation levied by the various Chiefs on their tribes takes the form of a poll-tax, called by the Lurs Sari or Sarmardi, which is levied on property at no fixed rate, but usually about 10 per cent. Tenants pay | total produce of wheat and \ total produce of rice. Internal and External Relations of :—The internal relations have been touched on above. With regard to external relations, they are friendly with the Dushman Z ari and Bavi, but are enemies with the Taiyibi. Comunications :—The main roads leading from the Buvair Ahmad terri tories are as follows :— To Behbehan via Tang Tikau. To Ram Hormuz, via Linda and Likkak. To Ardakan through their own country. Mineralogy :—Coa.\ is to be found in the Kuh-i-Dina (Dunia). Archceological :—Ruins and remains exist at Kurri. Surab Khan, who, together with the Taiyibi, are in the habit of attacking cheh (Dush- and looting caravans on the Lynch Road, the usual scenes of their attacks man Zian )* being the Gardan-i-Sarrak, Kaleh Madraseh and Rikat (Darreh Barfi). Their best known Chief was Muhammad Riza Khan, who was executed by the then (b) Dushman Ziari. The Dushman Ziari are a wild, lawless tribe, under the leadership of CheharBani- Governor of Shiraz, Prince Earidun Mirza, in 1840. The sub-divisions of the Dushman Ziari are as follows :— Sultan Ali. Qalandari. Shaikh Ali. Sau Dinari. Buvairi, Azizi. Shaikh Abbasi, - r Sirkakki. Nukr. Sadat.6 a u' Tliey number in aI1400 fai ^ ilie ^ and are capable of putting 600 fighting men in- man 11 Ziarif ' t0 field ’ 400 of Whom are armed with rifles - 0f these rifles a large percentage are Martinis, while the remainder are 5-shot rifles of German make, and a few British • 303. The latter are very highly prized and much sought after not only by this particular sub-tribe, but by the Kuhgalus in general. In former times the Dushman Ziari used to number as many as 1,000 families, but, owing to the oppression of their Chiefs, they have scattered, some tea the Bakhtiaris and some to the Arabs in the Zaidan district.

Internal and external relations of :—The Dushnr.n Ziari are on friendly terms with the Taiyibi (Sarhadi) and Buvair Ahmad, but on bad terms with the Bakhtiaris. Archceological remains are to be found at Siah Gul, a place in the summer quarters of the tribe. {c) Churam. The Churam sub-division, under the dual control of Kasim Khan and Chehar Abdullah Khan, inhabit land which is the fief (Persian of Nasr-ul-^ nicheh Mulk, Shirazi, and it is well known that much of the petty looting around ^ iuram h the town and in the district of Behbchan is due to them. Unlike the maj ority of other sub-divisional tribes they are not sub-divided&gt; numbering in all about 500 families, capable of putting an equal number of armed men into the field, together with 50 sowars -the total force being armed similarly to the sub-tribes mentioned above. In former times tribal tradition puts the number of families at 2,000, which, however, owing to oppression and other internal causes has been lessened to the present day number of 500, as mentioned above.

Communications :—Main road to Behb. han from Basht leads through Khairabad. Liravi. The Liravi sub-divisions will be found op page 2. According to tribal traditions their progenitor was a Behdarvand Bakhtiari (by name A Ali—Agha Ali), who fled from his own country and settling in the Tang -i- Lira, married a Lur girl, by whom he had four sons, from whom are sprung 4 of the present 5 sub-tribes of the Liravi. This is most easily explained by the sub-joined tree : A Ali. / \ 1 1 Bahman Taiyib Yusuf Khadir. Tribe Bahmai, Tribe Taiyibi, / . Garmsiri and Sar- hadi. Tribe Yusufi. Tribe Khadiri. the fifth sub-division being, it will be remembered, the A Jari (=Agha Jari). * (Prunus Syrica).These sub-divisions we will now deal with in turn. (a) Bahmai. The Bahmai are wild and lawless. The Ahmadi section of these is, how- Liravi (Bah ever, well and firmly ruled over by Ali Naki Khan. They are sub-divided mal)&lt; into two main divisions:— (a) Ahmadi. (b) Mahmudi. The Ahmadi are further sub-divided as follows :— Waisi. Qambari. Shusini. Baguli. Balyabi (Bu-l-Abi ?) Biqini. Mulla Abbasi. Isavi. Ghibi. Sadat-i-Mangana Zur. Shuja-ud-Dini. ’Ali Mihri. Malsakhti. Muhammad Musai. Yusufi. Mehdi. Mahmudi. The Bahmai at present number some 2,500 families, though in former times they numbered as many as 6,000 families. These, however, owing to oppres sion and other internal causes, little by little dispersed and settled in the Bakhtiari country. At present they could put an armed force of about 3,000 men into the field, together with 30 or 40 sowars. Boundaries of land inhabited by :— Kaleh-i-Babakhan (Bulfaris). , t Tashan. „ Kuh-i-Karun. „ Charusak. „ Chehar Darreh.. ,, Barani.

Genealogy of 'Ali NaJd Khan, Bahmai :— ’Ali Naki Khan, son of Muhammad Husain Khan, son of Khalil Khan, son of Mulla ’Ali Shir, son of Mulla Abdul Khalil, 2 or 3 more generations to Agha Ali, Behdarvand, Bakhtiari. ’Ali Naki Khan, has 8 brothers, viz.— 1 . Husain Khan, 2. Muhammad Shafi Khan, 3 . Husain Quli Khan, 4. Muhammad Taki Khan, Sarhang, 5. Muhammad ’Ali Khan, 6 . Jalil Khan, 7. ’Ali Muhammad Khan, 8 . Kubad Khan, Liravi (Bahmai). the first two of whom assist him in the administration of the tribe. Husain Khan is a man of strong character and feared by the tribe, as also is ’Ali Naki Khan. Muhammad Shafi Khan is clever, but unfortunately a heavy opium smoker. ’Ali Naki Khan, the eldest of the brothers, has a wife, the daughter of ’Ali Murad Khan-i-Taiyibi (Garmsiri), by whom he has one son, Lutf ’Ali Khan (about 7 years old in 1909) and two daughters. He has his headquarters at Likak, where also Muhammad Shah Khan lives. Husain Khan Bahmai l as four wives, by whom he has 3 sons (all small, 1910) and 2 daughters. Has his headquarters at (Upper) Mumbi (4,500 ), in the vicinity of which place are collected some 1,500 families of Bahmais and actually round the fort in which he lives, 40 families of Amalajat. The Upper Mumbi valley contains 500 khish of unirrigated ] and and one water mill situated at a place called Chiri. The only means of communication between Likak and Mumbi is either via the Tang-i-Laghar and the Tang-i-Do'a, or the Tang-i-Maghar and the Tang-i-Dola—both tracks are extremely difficult Tang-i* and impassable to anything but the very lightest loaded animals, and, even then, loads have to be man-hand’ed twice en route. on? Before dealing with the Muhammadi section of the Bahmai I will touch on various properties owned or leased by ’Ah Naki Khan, of which Tashan * Kai Kaus Dudangeh Kurdistan belong to the Bakhtiari Khans, and are rented by ’Ali Naki Khan.14 % Liravl TasAan.—The Tashan lands belong to Haji Khusra Khan, Sardar-uz- (Bahmai). ZafTar, and Yusuf Khan, Amir-i-Mujahid, by whom they are let to ’Ali Naki Khan for an annual rental of 3,000 tumans. These lands are well watered and inhabited by some 200 families, some of whom are Bahmai. The rest go by the name of Sadatd-Tashan, capable of supplying 150 fighting men, of whom, however, only frds would be armed with rifles, and even these with weapons of rather antiquated pattern. The Tashan lands also contain bitumen springs, 2 dungs (|rd of total area) of this oil-bearing land belongs to ’Ali Naki Khan, while the rest, viz., 4 dungs, belongs to Haji Khusru Khan, Sardar-uz-Zaffar, who has leased his share of the property to ’Ali Naki Khan for an annual rental of 500 tumans. Large quantities of bitumen are dug up annually and sold in Behbehan, fetching 30 to 40 krans per maund. Property of Cows. Sheep. Donkeys.

The land takes its name from a small Imamzadeh, therein situated, said to be the place of burial of a holy man by name Baba Ahmad, who was put to death in the Caliphate of ’Abbas. This is a place of pilgrimage for the Lurs, by whom it is venerated most highly, and which ranks in their unedu cated estimation almost equal in sanctity to Imam Riza in Meshed or Shah Chiragh in Shiraz. Ala-ud-Dini tribe. The Ala-ud-Dini are technically of the same stock as the Bahmai, but consider themselves separate from them.

Behbehan town, district and dependencies of. Behbehan. Historical. —Local tiadition tiaces the name of the town to the settlers who came there after the destruction of Arijan. These people came and camped there in Iliat fashion in black goats-hair tents, called by them “ Bohuns ”, for which they gradually substituted mud houses which thoy B aid were “ Behir az bohun' (Lur: better than tents). This appellation gradually by long usage became crystaliscd, through various stages Behtar a* bohun—Beh-az-bohun Beh-bez-bohun into its present form Behbehan. Behbehan is a town of extremely ancient and probably of Sassanian origin, though it is difficult to say definitely to whom it owes its foundation. It gained notoriety only after the destruction of Arijan and Kiibad, which latter name, it may be of interest tonote, was the name given to the 5th Kureh oi district at present represented by the Behbehan district, mm which in former times, Ears was divided viz. Istakhr, Darabjird, Sha ipnr, Ardashir and Kubad. We may say, however, with a due amount of certain y, that it existed prior to the 14th century, from the fact that Shanf-ud-Din ‘Ali Yazdi mentions that Taimur camped at Behbehan when en route from Tester (Shushtar) to Kaleh Safid. In more recent times, durmg the Governor ship of Mirza Kumu (circ. 1870), owing to his refusal to pay the taxes of Behbehan, the then Governor of Ears sent an expedition against Behb taian un der the command of Mansur Khan, who sacked the town and put its inhabi tants to the sword. Mirza Kumu himself, however, escaped and took refuge with the Ka’b Arabs in the vicinity of Fallahieh. The latter, it may be men tioned, are descendants of the Bani Ka’b Arabs who migrated from the Hedjaz. In later years, the Behbehan Governorship has been, oft and on, m the hands of the Bakhtiari Chiefs, the last occasion being during the winter of 1909-10 when Bias Khan, Bakhtiari, Sarum-ul-Mulk, son of Haji Khi.ru Khan, Sardar-uz-Zaffar, and Eath ’Ali Khan, Bakhtiari, Salar-i-Muyid, son of Lutf ’Ali Khan, Amir-i-Muffakhaon, held the Governorship for a Kw months, *he former on behalf of the Ilkhani, and the latter on behalf of the Ha] i Ilkham family of the Bakhtiaris.

The bitumen deposits are situated in a small valley subsidiary to the main valley in which Tashan is situated. (For route to same from Kaleh Likak vide, below). The Tashan lands belong to Haji Khusra Khan, Sardar-uz-Zaffar, and Yusu- Khan, Amir-i-Mujahid, by whom they are led to ’Ali Naki Khan for an annual rental of 3,000 Twmns. These lands contain bitumen spiings, 2 dung* of the total area) of which oil bearing land belongs to ’Ali Naki Khan, while the rest, viz. 4 dungs, belongs to Haji Khusra Khan, Sardar-uz-Zaffar, who has leased his share of the property to ’All Naki Khan at an annual rental of 500 Tumans, Large quantities of the bitumen are dug up annually and sold in Behbehan, fetching 30 to 40 Krans per maund (Behbehan). The subsidiary valley in which theHbitumen is found is formed by^a gatch ‘ outlier to the main limestone range, the “ dip ” of the strata of which is 43 , The valley runs north and south, is 80 yards broad and 200 yards long, with a gen eral slope of 1°. The composition of the soil is gatch superimposed on a substratum of blue shale, while in places the surface of the ground is covered with patches of saline deposit. Pits have been sunk to a depth of about 10' and the bitumen, which is stratified, thence ex tracted. The first 3 or 4 layers are about 2' thick, with an equal depth of soil in between each. Further down, the bitumen appears to be softer and in a solid mass. No actual liquid crude oil was seen, but the men who were in the habit of digging up the bitumen report that oil does occasionally ooze up from the deeper pits. Fresh water in abundance is obtainable about J mile away from the Ab-i-Tashun along the banks of winch also bitumen deposits are to be seen. Wood for fuel is obtainable in abundance in the neighbourhood. Route to Bitumen springs. • 1 From Kaleh Likak. (Extract from route report by Lieutenant J. G. L. Ranking, I.A., His Majesty's Consul, Ahwaz). * * * Road leads past Kaleh Likak and passes south-east through low gatch hills to 3 miles, where it turns south-south-east down a dry water course. Main valley at this point changes direction and branches to east by south and east-south-east, ine former branch is only about 2 miles in depth and comes to an end m a gar dan or low pass. The latter branch is 4 miles long and is then blocked right across by a broken mass of low gatch hills, the far slopes of which are in the hands of the Taiyibi. From 3 miles, the water course is bordered on the south by precipitous cliffs, and on the south-east by gatch bills. The general breadth of valley thus formed is 1 mile. At 2 f mile the Tang-i-Bizak, which contains sulphur springs (in the mam range), is passed 4 miles to the east. At 4 miles some large springs of brackish water are passed and at 4* miles a Iresh spring is passed 500 yards to the south, situated in a cleft at the foot of the chits. At 4J miles the watercourse is left and a diiection south-east by south taken across the gatch hills to the bitumen deposits, which are reached at 7J miles. *37 APPENDIX II. ARCHEOLOGICAL. Tashan is tho site of extensive remains, of what, probably in the time of the Atabegs, was a large town. It extends for about 2 miles along the skirts of the range, in the vicinity of Tang-i-Bend, with an average breadth of about 4 miles. Few of the houses have any roofs on, such as have being inhabited by the Sadat-i-Tashan. They are mostly square in ground plan, with domed roofs and pointed arches, built of undressed stones, mortared together with a substance closely resembling gatch, (gypsum). The Tashan spring, mentioned by Baron de Bode still exists, but no trace of the sacred fish is to be found, nor is the circumstance of their former existence known to any of the inhabitants. No inscriptions are to be found either in the remains of the town itself or in the vicinity nearer than the Tang-i-Bend and the Tang-i-Sarvak (Tang-i-Saulek of de Bode). For a detailed description of the inscription in the latter place I would refer the reader to Baron C. A. de Bode’s “ Travels in Luristan and Arabistan ” Volume I, page 353 et seq., which is fairly accurate, though I take the liberty of disagreeing with him on three points. Firstly, he makes no mention of the remains of what evidently was a large town, the remains of which, however, are now almost obliterated, situated at the western entrance of the Tang-i-Sarvak. Secondly, his transcript of the inscriptions on the monolite differs very greatly from the transcript which I took with great care on the spot. In the hopes that the inscription may be of interest, I take the liberty of sub-joining a copy. Inscription near the huntsman, consisting of four lines as follows :— {Not reproduced).The altar inscription, also containing 4 lines :— (Not reproduced.) Thirdly, I would point out that this character exists to my own’personal knowledge in one other place, though not mentioned by Sir H. Layard in his “ Early Adventures 1, The inscription is of one line and exists in a cleft, known as Hong-i-Nauruzi by the Lurs though the real name is Kheng-i-Nauruzi, in the hills at the Northern end of the plain of Malamir under a tablet representing a horseman with a man facing him. The cleft is difficult of access and the tablet not easy to find. The inscription is as follows (Not reproduced).APPENDIX III. ROUTES FROM AHWAZ TO ISFAHAN.

Route No. IV is extremely difficult immediately after entering the Kuhgalu country and, in its present state, absolutely impassable to all but the very lightest laden animals* Even the Lurs themselves admit its difficulty and describe it by the epithet “ Pidr “ Rah-i-Pidr Sukhta ’ ’ and when a Lur admits as much and says a road is difficult, the average caravan may look for trouble and generally gets it! The great advantage of this route is its shortness, being even more direct than Route No. I. It has water and fuel (wood) in plenty, and supplies are available from the Iliats.43 APPENDIX V. NOTABLES OF BEHBEHAN. The following list gives briefly the most influential and important men in Behbe- han. t' i » l 1 1. Mirza ’Ali Riza Khan (Bahadur-i-Divan), son of Mirza Sultan Muhammad Khan, son of Mirza Mansur Khan, descended from the notorious Mirza Kumu, who was Governor of Behbehan circ., 1869. This Mirza Kumu claimed that his family had migrated from Mecca and that they were descended from the Prophet. This family has for centuries lived in Behbehan, and its senior member usually acts as Deputy Governor, and, in the absence of any Governor appointed by the Central Government, as Governor of the town. On the appointment of Ilias Khan, Bakhtiari, Sarum-ul-Mulk, as Govern or of Behbehan in 1909 one of the latter’s first acts was to imprison Mirza ’Ali Riza and loot his house and property, on the plea that the latter was a reactionary. Later, however, Mirza ’ Ali Riza was restored to the post of Deputy Governor on the depar ture of the Bakhtiari Governor from Behbehan, which post he fills at present (summer 1910). He is a wealthy man, aged about 55, and has 4 grown up sons and 4 daughters, 2. Haji Saiyid Husain, aged 60, is chief Mujtahid of Behbehan—a wealthy man of the Behbehan Mahal 7 eh (quarter).

Mumai, or “ Munmnai ” as it is called by the Kuhgalu, is found in various places in their country; the best being obtained at Tang Tikau, whence 200 misqals are taken annually to Behhehan and there sold for export to various parts of Persia. It is also found at Tang-i-Bin, Kuh-i-Bewara, and Kaleh Nauzar (Kaleh Nadir). At the above mentioned places it exudes from the rock surface and is collected by the Kuhgalu. It is also found in the territories of the Taiyibi Garmsiri at Tang-i-Bard-i-Safid, where it is extracted by a special process. A hole, about 4' deep and 2 yards in diameter, is dug in the ground and a wood fire is lit in this and kept burning for about 24 hours. The fire and ashes are then cleared out and the hole roofed over with sticks covered with earth and so left for a couple of days, when the hole is uncovered. In the interim the Mvmai is found to have exuded from the sides of the pit and is collected and carried away for sale. This Mumoi is a black wax-like substance, in former times, and at the present to a lesser degree, highly prized by the Persians for its healing qualities, more especially for bruises and fractures, in which instances it was mixed with melted sheep s fat and the mixture rubbed on or applied while still hot. It used to figure prominently among the presents sent by Persian Sovereigns to other Potentates and is mentioned by many ancient writers, from among whom may be quoted Count Ferrieres Sauve Boeuf, who relates that Ali Murad Khan sent about 1 ounce of the wax, enclosed in a golden casket to the Empress of Russia. The market value of the wax at the present day is about 10 Tumans per 800 MisqaU varying according to its quality and purity. Lignite is found in the Kuh-i-Dina in the Buvair Ahmad country, and in th® Tang-i-Maghar, in the territories of the Bahmai. Iron is found in the Tang-i-Maghar, mentioned above, Oil and Bitumen in a valley close to, and east of, the Tang Tikau and in a valley near Tashan (vide Appendix I). In the former of these places the oil exists m the form which is technically known as “ shows,” and flows into a local stream, on the surface of whose waters it is borne away. Tea Plant is found growing wild on the hill slopes between the Kuh-i-Siah and Kuh-i-Safid, and is to some slight extent used by the poorer of the local Lurs, who can not afford, or who run out of, the more costly manufactured imported article. Sulphur is found at Tang-i-Bin, and excellent cypress wood m the Tang-i-Sarvak, where large quantities of timber are cut and taken into Behbehan for building purposes, formerly free but latterly on an annual payment of 20 boxes of sugar to Ah Naki Khan, Bahmai, in whose territory the Tang-i-Sarvak is situated. It is interesting to no.e that the tang, mentioned by Baron C. A. de Bode in his “Travels in Lunsfan and Arabistan” in connection with rock sculptures, is the same place and should be, as above stated, Tang-i-Sarvak ; deriving its name from the large number of cypress tree* (Pers : Sarv) which clothe the hill sides forming the defile.51 APPENDIX IX. r REVENUE. Speaking generally we may say that all the various sub-tribes, which go to make up the Kuhgalu, are taxed on the same principle, with but minor points of difference bet ween the various systems. Their Maliat or taxation is of two kinds, viz. j—. (a) Khaki and (6) Badi or Sari t Khaki being taxation on cereals and property^ while Sari is a poll-tax. Tenants usually pay Khaki, at a rate of £ or J produce in kind, to the landlord, in addition to the Sari, The taxation is not heavy and bears but lightly on the tribes men. Camp.
