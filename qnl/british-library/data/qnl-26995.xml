Report by M.Mirbadaleff f the local representative at Meshed of the Nansen Committee, on the condition of Russian refugees in (East) Persia during the period April 1932 to 1st September 1934. () SEEN POLITIC**. C«MMITTEBk 21 FEB 19 ft Previous papers :— Copy of to FOR INFORMATION. M.Mirbadaleff, who is now the Meshed representative of the Nansen Committee of the League of Nations, is a Turcoman and a former Minister of the Emir of Bokhara. His report was furnished at the request of the Nansen Committee, but since it contains comments unfavourable to the Persian Government which if discovered might react unfavourably against him, he desired that if possible the report might be forwarded to Geneva through British official sources. The Foreign Office have decided, however, no doubt correctly, that it would be undesirable for H.M.G. to take any part in transmitting a report of this nature to the Nansen Office. The/The report is of much interest and in the opinion of Major Hamber, the Secretary to the Consul-General at Meshed , it is substantially accurate. It should be read with the explanatory notes appended at the end by Major Hamber (page 6 ). The figure of 13,400 given on page 3 for refugees registered as entering Khorasan from April 1932 to April 1934 represents only the numbers registered at Meshed and it is probable that the actual number of refugees from Central Asia oossing into Persia east of the Caspian during the years 1932 to 1934 exceeded 30,000. That this is a conservative estimate will be seen by reference to the Meshed Report at P.Z.8200/33 which suggests a figure of about 43,000 for refugees entering Khorasan during the short period from 15th February to 1st October 1933, though it appears that we should deduct from the latter figure the number of refugees sent back to the U. S.S.R. It should also be noted that the detailed statistics given on pages 4 and 5 refer only to the comparatively small number of European^or at any rate Europeanised 5 refugees. M.Mirbadaleff makes some suggestions at the end of his report (page 6 ) with a view to improving the position of Russian refugees in Persia, including the institution of an authority for the issue of Nansen passports to the refugees. It appears, however,, from para. 7 of Sir R.Hoare's despatch (r-M of Nov.11th 1934^that the Persian Government do in fact issue ? Nansen certificates to persons who have already obtained definite permission to enter some other country*, but that the trouble is that most of the refugees are too destitute to be able to do so. The section of the report dealing with the period from April 1934 onwards (page 5) confirms the infoimation already received in the Meshed Intelligence Summaries that very few refugees have succeeded in getting through to Meshed since the beginning of 1934 owing to strict orders issued by the Persian/Minute Paper. Department /~\ r '~EN ^ ^ FEB 1935 Persian Government that refugees are to be sent back to the U.S.S.R. The statistics given of refugees sent back to Russia (apparently only about 10^ succeed in entering Persia) and the suggestion in the last paragraph of the explanatory notes (page 7) that a secret agreement exists between the Persian and Soviet Governments for the exchange of refugees from either country make somewhat unpleasant reading. I discussed the question of the existence of such an agreement with the Foreign Office on the telephone, and Mr.Baggallay said that as far as he knew the Foreign Office had had no previous information on this subject. He thought it extremely unlikely that there could be any such agreement between the two Governments, but suggested that local arrangements of this kind might quite probably be made occasionally between the local Persian and Soviet frontier authorities. It is easy to sympathise with the difficulties of the Persians in dealing with such a large influx of refugees, a large proportion of whom are turbulent tribesmen (Turcomans). In this connection reference is invited to the extract from a private report furnished by Mr.Busk of the Tehran Legation in 1932 at Flag E. It will be remembered that at the end of 1931 the Consul-General at Meshed was instructed to make unofficial representations to the Persian Governor-General at Meshed on the subject of the treatment of Russian refugees and it is possible that Colonel Barrett's conversation then with the Governor- General may have done some good,at any rate for a time. Our position vis-a-vis the Persian authorities in this matter i a however somewhat delicate, end it is extremely doubtful whether any action could be taken by us which would be of permanent benefit to the 41 /u Foreign Office,THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT A J \ /..

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a despatch from the acting British consul-general at Meshed on the subject of the influx of refugees from Russia into Persia. This despatch and its enclosures constitute a valuable addition to the previous correspondence on the subject, ending with my despatch No. 583 of the 16th December, 1933. 2. I have the honour to suggest for consideration that the original Russian text of the letter and report be forwarded to the Nansen Committee, but if this is not considered desirable, I shall be glad if it can be returned through me to M. Mirbadaleff, in order that he may be able to forward it by post, if he so desires. 3. I have retained no copy of the Russian text, which is not being sent to his Excellency the Viceroy of India, to whom I am sending a copy of this despatch. I am also sending a copy, without the Russian text, to His Majesty's consul at Tabriz (No. 25), and one without any enclosures to His Majesty’s consul- general at Meshed (No. 84). I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul-General Gastrell to Sir R. Hoare. (No. 141-8/8. Confidential.) Sir, Meshed, October 25, 1934. I HAVE the honour to submit herewith copies of a despatch No. 262 of the 27 th September, 1934, and enclosures, which I have received from Major L. G. W. Hamber, secretary to this consulate-general. 2. The enclosures include a confidential note by the translator, which confirms and enlarges on the points brought forward by M. Mirbadalefi, the writer of the letter intended for the Nansen Committee of the League of Nations. 3. If you have no objection, it is suggested that the above-mentioned letter may be transmitted to the Nansen Committee by safe means. 4. The translator’s note may perhaps be considered as a document unsuitable for transmission to the Nansen Committee, but kept as a confidential record confirming the practice of exchanging refugees by the Persian and Russian authorities on the Khorassan frontier. 5. In this connexion I beg to refer to Colonel Daly’s despatch No. 36 of the 15th November, 1933. I have, &amp;c. E. H. GASTRELL. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Major Hamber to Consul-General Gastrell.

I HAVE the honour to forward for such action as you consider necessary a translation of a report furnished at the request of the Nansen Committee of the League of Nations, Geneva, by their local representative, M. Haidar Khoja Mirbadaleff. M. Mirbadaleff is a Turkoman, formerly a Minister of the Emir of Bokhara, a man of intelligence and great integrity, long resident in Meshed. He was instrumental in saving the life of the last British consul-general at Tashkent, Colonel Bailey (now Resident at Sikkim), during the Bolshevik revolution. ; 290 c—8] b po ' , I'xJk3 Enclosure 5 in No. 1. (Translation.) Condition of Ref ugees in Persia up to September 1 , 1934. ALL refugee emigrants into Persia may be divided into three categories :— 1. Political Emigrants. —Which are in the majority Turkomans, Kirghiz, Russians, Armenians and Jews. 2. Economic Emigrants. —To which category belong the Molokans,^) who, always living on the frontiers of Russia and Persia, cross from one side oi th'- frontier to the other depending on the varying economic conditions. 3. Occasional Emigrants. —Include foreigners (non-Russians) running away from Russia trying to reach their home countries, and criminals flying from justice. From April 1932 to April 1934, 13,406 refugees have been registered as entering Khorassan.(') Of these— As can be seen, the majority of these emigrants consist oi the nationalities bordering on Persia, i.e., the inhabitants of Turkistan : iurkomans and Kirghiz. These knowing the frontier region crossed into Persia in complete settlements with the remnants of their possessions, their camels, horses, donkeys and house hold effects. All Turkomans, on reaching Meshed, were put under the control oi the military headquarters for settlement and distribution by districts. . In view of the past warlike history of the Turkomans, the Persian Govern ment appears afraid to grant much freedom to these emigrants, and the military effect their settlement with this strategy in view. The result has been the cause of much suffering. No land is made available for them with good climatic conditions : they are settled in unhealthy areas short of water, or marshy districts, or those bordering the desert region near Sarakhs. As an example of the conditions of settlement may be quoted the case of a group of 300 “ Salir ” Turkomans settled at Bagh Bagu (between Meshed and Sarakhs) in a marshy district in 1932. During one year 220 died of malaria and only eighty at present remain alive. The other Turkomans also exist under difficult and trying conditions. In these very remote places from the towns they cannot develop their crops, and are forced to sell them for a song where they stand. They cannot even count on raising enough for even their own consumption in these remote and unhealthy districts of Persia. The solution of this difficulty would be to permit the emigrants themselves to seek suitable unoccupied districts, and afford them State assistance in the form of a loan to develop irrigation to render habitable fresh areas for their settlement. The Kirghiz, exclusively a nomad people who exist by stock-rearing in Russia, here (in Persia) are forced to become coolies. They have found work in 1 various places and there are no special regulations limiting their freedom of movement. They are distributed in various districts between Meshed and Tehran. ( 3 ) Individual registration of these nationalities (Turkoman and Kirghiz) has not been ordered, only the numbers of the arrivals are noted, since they are classified by the Persians under one heading, i.e., peasant cultivators or stock raisers. All other refugees are registered individually. (!) Note. Molokans are a sect of dissenters from the Orthodox Church resembling- the Quakers in their refusal to bear arms. They are exclusively cultivators and stock rearers. ( 2 ) &gt;,’ote. —These figures represent, the numbers registered at Meshed, and do not include a large number who were not registered or crossed the frontier at points remote from Meshed and were registered elsewhere; refugees entering Asterabad Province are not included. A very large number of Yamut Turkomans crossed the frontier here last year, probably about 10.000. The total figure for all refugees from Central Asia for this period is probably nearer 30,000, which is an estimate given by the Amir Lashkir of the Eastern Army.

It appears, therefore, that conditions in the “ Workers and Peasants” country are so miserable that the better workers attempt to escape abroad :—Nationalities of refugees— Russians ... 261 Per Cent. 70-5 Uzbegs 20 54 Tartars 27 7 3 Caucasian tribes (Osetins, Georgians, &amp;c.) ... 32 8-9 Foreigners (Poles, Germans, Greeks, Roumanians, Hungarians, &amp;c.) ... 28 7 9 368 100 h regard to military service— Ex-commanding personnel 14 Per Cent. 3 9 Ex-other ranks 122 33 1 Not served 232 630 368 100 Many of those who had not served were young. The 63 per cent, above noted includes a majority of individuals of kulak (formerly well-to-do) families, which are not accepted for military service. Ages of refugees— Under 18 years 18-20 21-25 26-30 31-35 36-40 41-45 46-60 Per Cent. 3 0 9 31 90 82 22-3 82 22 3 56 152 51 13 9 34 9 2 29 72 368 100 It is characteristic that the ages from 21 to 30 comprise the majority of the ■emigrants who have received an exclusively Soviet education. By their flight from the country they demonstrate their disillusionment in any possible bright future for the Soviet regime. The greater number of refugees cross the frontier in the spring, in March and April, which is the easiest time to cross and at the same time coincides with the most critical period of the year with regard to food supplies in Russia. As an average, the monthly arrivals in Meshed might be taken as 500 Turkomans and 20 Russians. From April this year (1934) (Note. —Actually from the beginning of the vear), on account of strict orders which have been issued (by the Persian Government), with few exceptions, all refugees crossing the Persian frontier have been returned to Russia. The exceptions are the families of emigrants who are already in Persia and foreigners escaping through Persia to their native countries. The great numbers attempting to escape into Persia and the percentage that comes to grief on the frontier are shown by the evidence of certain refugees who have escaped from the prison at Askhabad. Out of the total number of prisoners there are not less than 1,000 persons undergoing sentence for attempted crossing of the frontier, a figure which is maintained the whole year through. Since after four or five months’ imprisonment for crossing the frontier the prisoners are liberated or sent to exile, it may be estimated that the number so incarcerated reaches about 2,000 per year, which, in comparison with the average annual number reaching Meshed (about 200), shows that 90 per cent, are caught and 10 ^ef'cehf:~succeed m entering Persia. These figures do not apply to Turkomans or Kirghiz, who, when arrested crossing the frontier, are not imprisoned but sent to exile to the north. When emigrants reach Meshed, i.e., Russians, Armenians, Jews and others, they are taken over by the police (“ nazmieh ”) of the Province of Khorassan.0 Russians are not permitted to remain in the vicinity of the frontier, for which reason they are made to choose some town for residence outside Khorassan, Mazanderan or the Tabriz districts. All such places are located in the interior of Persia and are not industrial centres, but exclusively agricultural. It is practically impossible for the majority of the qualified workers to find employment, and on arrival in such towns the refugees live for a long time in great need, until they manage somehow or other to find jobs individually in newly opened-up undertakings. This system of selection of place for settlement for refugees is exceedingly unpractical, and in order to save the unfortunate refugees much unnecessary suffering it is extremely desirable that a special police department for dealing with this question should be created in Tehran, which would be kept informed of labour demands of State or other undertakings, and despatch refugees in accordance with their qualifications to take up such employment. A great difficulty also exists in the absence of any documents in the possession of the emigrants on the authority of which temporary residence permits can be issued to them. The institution of an authority for the issue of Nansen passports is urgently required for the emigrants in Persia, in the absence of which they are unable to travel to other countries where they might successfully exploit their qualifications. Emigrants have no right to create or organise any form of committees, and there is no recognised definition of their rights. In any case the living conditions and state of the refugees are entirely dependent on the attitude of the local Government servants. Such a mass of refugees totalling tens of thousands should have some statutory rights as emigrants and at the same time a representative from the League of Nations with authority to represent on their behalf to the Persian EXPLANATORY notes have been added where it appeared desirable to the text of the document. With regard to the subject-matter of the report:— 1. In substance it is correct. The tabulated particulars refer only to the Russian element of the refugees, not the Asiatics or the Molokans. As mentioned in the “Notes,' the figures only refer to the numbers registered in Meshed, presumably by the nazmieh, from whom it is thought the particulars must have been obtained. These particulars, though representative of the general situation, certainly do not give an accurate idea of the total numbers which have arrived across the frontier during the period in question. It is impossible to arrive at anything more than an approximate estimate. It is thought that the actual figures of refugees from Central Asia crossing into Persia east of the Caspian, during the years 1932-34, might be approximately :— 2. Regarding the numbers returned by the Persians on the frontier or caught by the Soviet frontier guards attempting to cross. The figure of 2,000 per annum, given in the report, may not be an exaggeration. A refugee who was once handed back by the Persian frontier guards to the G.P.U., but succeeded in escaping from Askhabad prison in August 1934 and arrived in Meshed without being rearrested, told me that out of the 300 odd prisoners in the batch with Enclosure 6 in No. 1. Notes by Translator. Turkomans and Kirghiz Molokans Russians Caucasians and others ... Jews 27,000 2,000 1,000 500 1,000 Total 31,500which he was imprisoned, about forty were under sentence for attempting to ■cross the frontier into Persia. It is known the total in Askhabad prison exceeds 2,000, so the figures given by the refugee can only be regarded as indicative. 3. First-hand evidence exists of the miserable condition of the refugees in some of the towns in the interior of Persia where no work can be found, many are reduced to begging. They are given 1 rial per day by the Persian authorities for food when they are out of employment (which is the state of the majority). Particularly miserable is the lot of the large number of refugees stranded in such towns as Kazvin, Zinjan, Sabzewar and Isfahan. In other parts some have been fortunate enough to find employment on the southern section of the Persian Railway. In general they are not permitted to work in Mazanderan on account of its proximity to Soviet Russia. Refugees are net allowed to remain in Tehran, though some have managed to do so. These are fortunate in that they mostly succeed in obtaining work. 4. The Persian authorities make capital out of the statement that numbers I of G.P.U. agents are sent into Persia in the guise of refugees. This is generally speaking a gross exaggeration, it is not implied that this has never been done, but it is well established that all the serious work of the G.P.U. and the | Comintern is conducted almost exclusively by the Soviet trade organisations, who j by virtue of their position and official status are in an infinitely stronger position | to travel throughout the country, besides controlling funds for their work. The status of a refugee in any case is so bad that he could not hope to work without being discovered, since the slightest display of capital in his possession would certainly land him in the jail as a suspect. 5. A number of refugees have, from time to time, returned to Soviet Russia with the assistance of the Soviet consulates. These, in most cases, are those who have been driven to desperation by continued unemployment or their treatment at the hands of the Persians. It is true that some (generally youths), thoroughly imbued with communistic doctrines, who ran away to Persia for a venture, return willingly to bolshevism, but the percentage is small. The Soviet authorities make as much capital as possible out of every returning refugee to discredit the remainder. It is believed that a secret agreement exists between the Persian and Soviet \ Governments for the exchange of refugees from either country; it is definitely \ known that Russians have been kept in confinement in some cases for months, both on the frontier and also in Meshed, before being banded back to the Soviet authorities. It is said that in such cases individuals have been detained until 1 notification was received of some individual “wanted' by the Persians being ‘ captured, when an exchange is arranged. o% N0.4C (E 7883/43/»4; FORKTCH OPPICK, SlAt January 9 1935. 1935 Vith rffr rt'noe to Sir Reginald Koore f a drapritoh ro,495 of 9th TTovt'tab* r f 1934 relative to the inriux of r* fugcra from Hussio lato Persia, x return to you her' with the original RuseIan text of the lett r and report by H* Mirbedalefl which were enclored in that deep^tch. £• I oonciacr that it woalo be andeoirablc tor His Majc oty’s Oov« rniarnt to take any part in tmnoaltting a re ort of this nature to the ffan^cn ofx’ice# Ths report la admittedly extrouely lntcncting 9 and deale with eonditiono which tnuat evoke general sympathy; but it !• nevertheless highly critical of two gorommentot that of Coviet Kussia and that of Persia, both of Which countries are .ueabera of the League* Were His Majesty* s Oovrmacnt to transmit it to its destination it would be clear that the documents had left Persia through the channel of Kio Majesty's Legation} and even if the rrport were to be forwarded without cny indication of the channel of tx*anSjaio£ion 9 th© foot that it had left Persia by the courier of His Majesty’s Legation rcmia be known to M.

Refugees from Russia continue to arrive in North-West Persia. Tabriz reports the arrival of forty Christians (Armenian, Russian, &amp;c.) and over 100 Tartars. These refugees are being despatched to the south. 9. Azerbaijan. (i) A serious shortage of wheat prevails in this province and bakeries are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain the quantities necessary for the supply of bread to local inhabitants. The prospects of a poor harvest, moreover, add to the difficulties of the situation. Great damage has been done to the crops by floods and late frosts. The actual area under wheat is, probably, much less than usual, owing to the fact that the grain required for sowing has been consumed by the famished population. (ii) The American mission to the Assyrians in Rezaieh has been closed down. For some time past the mission authorities and their flock have been in conflict with the Persian Government. 10. Khorasan. (i) The strength of the Persian frontier posts at Lutfabad, Sham Khan, Bajgiran, Gif an, Jurkalan and Sarrakhs has been doubled. This is said to be in reply to a similar increase in the strength of the Russian posts which had been effected to check smuggling and the exit of refugees. (ii) The importation of silk from Persia into India via Zahidan continues in considerable quantities. 11. Khuzistan. (i) A poor state of security is reported to have existed in Ahwaz and the neighbourhood during March. On two occasions local employees of the Anglo- Pelsian Oil Company were attacked by robbers, resulting in one person being killed and several wounded. The military assisted the police in the restoration of order.

They have been sent to BURJNURD pending orders for their disposal. past three months regarding the Persian attitude to refugees from Russia, the numbers reaching Meshed are almost nil. This is due to various causes, firstly,owing to the improvement of the food situation in Central Asia the numbers attempting to cross into Persia have appreciably diminished. It may be said that those who now attempt to do so are prompted by some political disability rather than by motives of starvation, which was the chief cause in the earlier part of 1933. their garrisons along the frontier. A special Regiment of Frontier Guards was raised during the latter half of 1933, and increased Military and Amnieh posts have made it exceedingly difficult for refugees to enter any distance into the country without being arrested. refugees should be turned back, and this certainly seems to have been carried out. During the'past two months refugees resident in all Persian frontier towns or villages, both Russians and 4 A most noticeable change has occurred during the Secondly, the Persians have considerably increased Orders have been issued from Tehran that all Persians/Persians, even after two or more years 1 residence in Persia, have been collected and sent to the interior. Persians from Russia have been treated much the same as other refugees and sent to various destinations frequently regardless of their original place of residence. This action has caused considerable discontent, and a number have returned to Soviet Russia. A party of about 150 recently mobbed and attempted to beat the Persian Consul at Askhabad, who had to call in the Militia and G.P.U. for protection. This action on the part of the Persians has naturally been made capital of by^the Bolsheviks, who agitate among refugees for their return. Of the thirty odd thousand Turkomans who entered Persia in 1933 a considerable number have returned to Russia officially, through the agency of the Soviet Consulate General, Meshed. Thus due rather to their difficulties in Persia than to any love of the Soviet regime. It is only fair to say that the problem has been a difficult one from the Persian point of view, the country is not particularly fertile, and the Turkomans indifferent cultivators. They are much better off in Afghanistan where they appear to be relatively well treated. The Frontier officials and the Military having collected the profits are quite glad to see them leave the country. II. Soviet Central Asian Republics. 5. Economic . A noticeable improvement of the conditionsof the cultivators and workers throughout Central Asia dating from the latter months of 1933 has taken place. The harvest, which appears to have been a good one, probably assisted this, though it seems that the losses entailed in the famine winter of 1938-33 and the/the succession of strikes last summer, have not been without their result in shaping official policy* It is probably no exaggeration that upwards of 60,000 Turkomans, Uzbegs, Tajiks and othersmigrated into Persia and Afghanistan alone during 1933. The Soviet Government in order to retain labour for their scheme of cotton cultivation and to moderate the opposition of these independant minded tribes of the policy of collectivation, have been moreor less forced to ameliorate the conditions of the cultivators. All reports confirm the improvement of rations, concessions of clothing in kind, fuel etc. Bread sells at an average of 3 roubles per kilo, as opposed to 12 or 14 roubles in the winter of 1932-33. The quality has also been improved. The pay of the Red Army serving in Central Asia has also been raised, discipline is reported to be betterMinuo.

The staff of the Consulate General reported to him while he was there that a number of immigration permits had begun to reach them for delivery to certain of these Jews. These permits are to all appearances in order and issued by the proper authority, but Daly is somewhat disquieted by the fact that the persons to whom they are addressed all belong to the group which formed the subject of my secret letter Mo.l23M of November 29th. I am writing to hashed for the names of those concerned but think l ought to draw your attention to what Daly says without delay.

Refugees . The frontier is still entirely closed, no refugees have suceeded in reaching Meshed this year. They are all turned back. It is said that the Soviet Trade Agencies such as the Bureau Terse, on t-^e frontier, maintain an efficient espionage system which enables them to iind out who has crossed the frontier, if the refugees are individuals of any importance they succeed by brioery in having them handed over direct by the local .frontier Commanders to the Soviet Posts opposite, if they are of no importance they are just let loose on the frontier to take their chance. A small number of Persians, most individuals employed in Russia come over with official passports either on leave or on expiration of contract.^ 7. Refugees. Two Russian refugees broke into the Consulate Kelateh at Birjand recently and stole certain articles of furniture. They were apprehended and the stolen groods recovered. These refugees in Kain are starving and can obtain no employment at alk During the past quarter 4,500 Yamut Turkomans with 50,000 sheep, 4,000 cows and 3.000 camels, have entered Khorasan, from Russia. The 600 Soviet Jew refufrees who have been concentrnted at Mesh ad have been ordered to disperse to Ispahan, Kazvin, and Hamadan immediately. The gendarmerie post at Sarakhs has been increased by 25 men to deal with the continual flow of refugees in that locality. Forty Russian Jews who arrived via the Kalat frontier early in December were returned to Russia. Four Russians entered Persia via Kalat on December 19th. They were without anv nationality documents. About 24 miles from Meshad they were met by a servant sent from the Soviet Consulate General at Meshad who endeavoured to conduct them to the Consulate. They were arrested and sent to Tehran and the servant is in jail at Meshad. This incident confirms the belief that the recent activity of the police in rounding up soviet agents has some what crippled the internal organisation and made it necessary to introduce fresh agents from Russia who are passed off as refugees. Orders have been received in Khorasan to the effect that in future all refugees are to be sent back to Russia. Such orders have been previously issued, from time to time, but are not acted upon, except in the cases of un fortunate persons who have insufficient means to bribe the petty frontier offi- S cials. Genuine refugees are thus likely to be turned back, whiel agents supplied with funds can easily enter Persia.(P.Z. 1172/34) SECRET .

Relatively few refugees of any description arrived during the past month. Of the 600 odd Jewish refugees from Bokhara and Merv who collected in Meshed during 1933, 180 have been sent to Ramadan and Kazvin and other places. They are most persistent in their efforts to reach Palestine legally or illegally; it is thought that recently relatively few have succeeded in doing so direct from Meshed, though every conceivable string has been pulled.(P.Z. 841/34) SECRET , Extract from Meshed Intelligence Summary No. 9 for the month of September 1933. I.- KHURASAN. xxx 3. Refugees .- There has been a falling off in numbers of refugees arriving in Meshed during the past month. It seems probable that more are turned back at the frontier since the Persian Frontier Guards have recently been reinforced by additional troops specially engaged for the nurpose. This new frontier guard is recruited partly from ex-conscripts who volunteer for further service, and partly from locally recruited men from the frontier districts. Refugees are being sent from Meshed frequently under escort into the interior of Persia in considerable numbers, it is true that among them are many undesirables who take to stealing and crime. The majority are being sent to Isphahan, the journey being performed on foot, a distance of 1,000 miles. A certain number manage to get lifts on lorries, but it is certain that considerable hardship is suffered by the majority, particularly those with families. The Amir Lashkar recently stated that including Turkomans and others the total number of refugees which had/had crossed into Khorasan and Asterabad this year amounted to about 17,000. This is probably no exaggeration.^er&gt;rv - *~% TQ^s t (&gt; • / 2 . ^3 *— ^ f s -d-4- r '\_j /^• /2. -^3 ^ ^ Qjjfhorasan. (i) It is reported that during the period Eebruary-October of this year a total of 25,000 refugees had entered the Province of Khorasan from Russia. In addition 18,000 Persians, who had been domiciled in Russian Turkestan, returned to their own country. (ii) Three hundred and fifty of the Bujnurd Cavalry Regiment are reported to have been sent to guard the frontier along the Atrek River, where 5,000 Yamut recently entered Persia after fighting with the Ogpu and suffering many casualties. On the 26th August twelve lorries of arms arrived in Meshed from Tehran containing the following :— 350 rifles and 120 boxes of ammunition. 30 machine guns. 40 light automatics. 3 field guns. 4 boxes of telephone equipment. A new “fauj ” (regiment) of 800 cavalry has been raised at Bujnurd. The infantry of the former Bujnurd Composite Regiment has been transferred to Meshed and formed into a new regiment called Fauj No. 28 under the command of one Mavai (ex-Kadir of Bujnurd). It is also reported that twenty-seven Gokelan Turkomans were hanged near Turkoman Serai for suspected Bolshevik intrigue. There is reason to believe that of the new rifles mentioned above several have already been sold in Afghanistan via Kariz.In any further communication on this subject, please quote No. £. ^ I and address —not to any person by frame, but to— ‘The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1. v •'-/'I t n '- s 4 1 - -L .* INDIA DIRECT 1 THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to -ju-* and, by direction of the Secretary of State, % transmits herewith cop K* of the under-mentioned paper.

Perhaps 80% are turned back into Russia at the frontier. Those who « succeed in evading the frontier posts are escorted back by Amnieh guards and put across the frontier. A considerable number are repatriated from ;'eshed and Kuchan, and others, finding that they are unable to obtain employment in Persia approach and Soviet Consulate General and are sent back officially. In the case of the last mentioned category, if the refugee is a worker or peasant with nothing against him beyond the fact that he illegally crossed the frontier, he is normally released after about 6 months’ imprisonment.

A. Reftteeeb; - The influx of refugeee into Azerhaidjon continued during September. The number of Christians (Armenians and Russians) markedly increased during the last two months , an include, over 130 Armenians who arrived here (mostly via the difficult Julfa route) and ebout the sane numbex' of Rueaians. Both these elements included some women and children* but mostly consisted of young men (all artisans) from 16 to 25 years of age. The local Armenian Archbishopric and the Armenian Community (chiefly with the help of the Armenian hadie8 , Board) are doing all they can for these unlucky people. They are sheltered in the Armenian Cemetery* and are receiving clothing from the ^adies* Board and food from the Archbishopric. The Russians also get some help from the Archbishopric and live in Karavanserais fixed for them by the Police. Very few Tartars come to Tabriz itself; and even those who come here soon mingle with the local Moslem element an become lost to view. The iolice is still gradually sending all these refugees to Isfahan* Shiraz* etc. The Russians are the worst off of all the refugees, and many of them goaround the streets and bazaars begging. Local Soviets :- The Police consider they have finished the work of clearing Azerbaidjan of known long-established . Soviet Agents. Ali Mardenoff was the last of those to leave here early in September* upon the demand of the Persians. Prom —-— \ P z * ^firitish Consulate* 8357 | Tabriz.

It 1 b generally agreed that the new 0»P«U. Directorate here will have to work very hard to completely reeatablleh the old conditions. The Russians are now believed to attach much importance to their Hospital here; and ore alleged to use it to cloke their propaganda and various other activities. Their Inspectors from Teheran have much increased the Budget of the Hospital (subject to the ratification of Moscow) and its increased activity is taken to imply an attempt to use Charity aa a means to obtrin local favour. Moreover, the Director of the Hospital, one Dr. Suren Ter Devtian, an Armenian, very probably of Caucasian origin, who has been here for several years, and Karo Hovsepian (his Assistant) are both suspected of being members of the local G.F. U. subcommittee. It is even said that the Soviets intend to move their Hospital from its present small premises in the Gala Quarter close to their present Consulate General and therefore well under the eyes of the Police to new and more spacious premises near the projected new Consulate General. The Salaries of the entire Staff of the Hospital have been much increased. Movements of Soviet Agents: - Mgrditeh Zargarian the soviet Agent at and around Rezaieh and Gedovon Ter Mlnaesian, the G.P*U. Agent at Sauj-Bulak and District were both here some time in September, probably to give in reports and receive fresh instructions from the new G.P.U. Directorate here. Kurdish Unrest and Brigandage ?- On September 4th it was reported here that the anti-Persian activities of the Kurds had greatly increased in the preceding two weeks. Several raids on villages and attacks on road-guards etc. had occurredo connsd; ind one such raid towards the enci oi‘ Auguot by a b nd of 5060 armed iCurdish horsemen penetrated into Kohn -.ihahar ( a few mile i from oh/ihpur) raided sever 1 shops nd made good their eacape.

Tirrf continuation of my despatch No. 154 of April 6 th, I have the honour to inform you that the Minister for Foreign Affairs told me the other d ay that the influx into Persia of refugees from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was increasing. 2. I caused enquiry to be made of His Majesty^ if Consular Officers at Meshed and Tabriz, and I now have the honour to enclose copies of their reports. 3. Major Daly confirms His Highness’ statement that the refugees are becoming more numerous, while Mr. Palmer’s despatches show that there is a growing tendency to deport refugees from Azerbaijan to the south. I have, etc. (Signed) R.H. HOARE. P*S. In amplification of Major Daly’s despatch, I have the honour to enclose an extract from the Mesned Consulate- General diary for the month of April. (initialled) R.H.H. The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., (E 3270/1379/34) No. 261 . Sir, The Foreign OfficeCOPY No* 58 British Consulate Confidential* Tabriz Sir, May 10th, 1933. Refugees * I have the honour to confirm that, while refugees from Russia have from time to time been deported southwards from here, the remainder of those who had entered Persia without passports or visas and were resident at Tabriz were deported from here in March as reported in my No. 21 confidential of March 14th. The main difference over this expulsion was that for the first time no distinction was made between those who had found work here and those wno had not. 2. The reasons governing this decision were probably two fold:- (a) The chief one was the fear of more Bolshevik Agents having crept in in the guise of refugees. (b) The very real one of the already greatly increased cost of living. This latter has been gone into under a separate heading in my April Diary; and it will suffice to say that there was a bad harvest last year, and following the severe winter just ex perienced there is every prospect of a worse one this year. Prices are already considerably higher than last year: there has been much mortality among live-stock, there is a pronounced shortage of fodder, and bread is higher than it has/ R.H. Hoare, Esq., C.M.C., etc., etc., etc*, British Legation, Tehranhas been for 15 years. 3. Under these circumstances any very pronounced increase in the influx of refugees would naturally be serious for this Province. But the increase does not appear to be very serious as yet. 4. Naturally it would be awlcward for the Chief of Public Security to be cited as against his Tehran superiors; but he says:- (a) That about 500 persons who had crossed near Khudafirii* Bilasavar etc. had accumulated in Ardabil and other places during the winter. It had only recently been possible to send them southwards, the roads having been more or less blocked previously. (b) This sudden arrival of the above 500 might have been interpreted as all new arrivals, whereas they really represented those of 3 or 4 months. These refugees were mixed, but mainly Tartar. (c) While the above refugees could only be described as individuals . there was now a tendency towards whole families attempting to cross. Some such families were known to be near the river awaiting an opportunity, and the Persian guards were on the look out for them - not to turn them back, but to handle them. (d) The plan was now followed of dividing refugees into two classes and disposing of them accordingly 1• Agriculturists: Sent to Sinen, Sakiz, Kermanshah etc. 2 . Artificers and Craftsmen: Sent to the South - Isfahan, Kashan, etc. None were sent to Tehran or allowed to pass through Tehran or Tabriz, but sent via Mianeh and for Sineh etc via Mianeh-Maraghah.5. The above would scarcely as yet seem to justify this influx being described as having assumed dangerous proportions. But the remarks about wnole families awaiting opportuni ties to cross are probably quite correct, and may point to a large recrudescence of such escapes into Persia. 6 . One gathers that conditions during the last winter in the Caucasus must have been almost incredibly terrible. I have in the last few days so frequently heard stories of actual cannibalism - i.e of families exchanging and eating their repsective cnildren - that I feel forced to report these persistent rumours as possibly having a basis of truth. The continued influx of emigrants from the Ukraine and elsewhere must alone be enough to account for an ever increas ing overflow from the Caucasus in the directions of Persia, Turkestan, and Turkey. 8 . There is doubt that emigrations to Turkey also continue steadily. I have, etc., (Signed) STANHOPE PALMER. H.B.M. Consul.COPY Np^_60 • British Consulate Tabriz May 12th, 1933. Refugees . Sir, I have the honour to report that on May llth about 50 refugees - mixed Moslems Armenians and Russians including 4 women - arrived at Tabriz from Julfa under Military escort and are at present in custody at the barracks. After the usual preliminary enquiries, they will be handed over to the Civil Police for disposal. 2. The above would seem to contradict my statement in my report 58 that ’’refugees were never sent nowadays via Tabriz”; but this seeming discrepancy is because these refugees entered Persia near Julfa - from where there is only the one obvious road - and not at Khudafirin or Bilasavar. 3. Crossings near Julfa are unusual, as there are more guards near there, wnile the river is deep and the banks are steep slopes and exposed to fire; while near Khudafirin and Bilasavar the river is shallow and the banks are easier. 4. During the escapes of 4 or 5 of the present refugees the Russian Frontier Guards fired and their bullets naturally fell in Persian territory - whereupon the Persian frontier guards fired into Russian territory as a reply. There were no casualties. R.H. Hoare Esq., C.M.G., etc., etc., etc., British Legation, I have, etc., (Signed) STANHOPE PALMER. H.B.M. Consul. TehranBritish Consulate COPY No. 69 Confidential• Tabriz May 19th, 1933. Sir, With further reference to my recent reports concerning the deportation of refugees, I have the honour to state that these continue - especially from Tabriz. A further 70 or 80 - mostly Moslem Tartars settled in the Davachi Quarter - were deported to the South on May 17th. 2. In connection with these expulsions one version has it that the Russians - who certainly at one time viewed the presence of anti-Soviet Tartar and Armenian elements near the frontier with great uneasiness - have deliberately engineered a 'raid' by some of them in order to enable themselves to insist on the deportation of all. 3. According to this version:- 16 refugees were collected, who included a few Russian agents-provocateurs, the rest being indigent Tartars from the Caucasus. They were given arms and money, and through these agents -provocateurs a 'raid' on Russian territory was organized. Before the group reached the Araxes the Soviets reported their expedition to the Persian Authorities whose Frontier Guards captired all of these men. This occurred on May 8 th. Immediately upon this the Russians complained at Tehran and an order came the same day to deport all refugees from Azerbaidjan, and especially from Tabriz. The/ R.H. Hoare Esq., C.M.G., etc., etc*, etc., Tehran. /The Soviets tried to throw the responsibility of this matter upon the local anti-Soviet elements and especially upon the Armenian Dasnnag. But the latter had known of this plan previously and had warned all Armenian refugees not to take part in any such ’’expedition” threatening to shoot any one who did so. They could thus not be implicated in the charges which the Soviets tried to bring against them. 4. My informant continues: There is moreover the regrettable fact that while the genuine anti-Bolshevik refugees are deported, the Soviets manage, by bribery etc., to secure exemption for those ’’refugees” who are in reality their agents. The condition of these deported refugees is reported to be terrible, especially that of the Christians (Armenians, Russians, Assyrians etc.) and letters received here from them - from Zinjan, Kazvin etc. - beg for help. 5. The wuole of the above 16 men were disarmed and brought here 4-5 days after the incident and were deported; so that in this case the Soviets are presumed to have been un able to save their agents - even if they wanted to do so. They may, moreover, prove useful as propagandists in the centres to which they have been deported, with the official reputation of being ardent enemies of the Soviets. 6 . I have reported the above statement under all reserve, and confess that I am quite unable to express any opinion as to its credibility. 7• My other information is that the Dashnag here have an Agent among the Soviets whom the latter believe to be their man. Through this man the Soviets expect to receive ’’Dashnag” information about the Rowanduz Route; and the Dasnnag intend to give them false information, while their agent will thusbe introduced to those of the G«P.U* Staff working along the owanduz line, and will learn their intentions in order to defeat them. 8 . Refugees continue to arrive from Russia every day and they all share the lot of the deported, generally under bad conditions. 9. Copy to Bagdad under 422/21/33, via H.M. Legation, please.

His Britannic Majesty^ Envoy Extraordinary &amp; Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, TehranExtract from Meshed Consulate-General Diary for the month of April, 1933. 2. REFUGEES. The severe famine in Russia has given rise to an unprecedented influx of refugees. The Soviet have apparently relaxed &lt; efforts to stop these destitute people from crossing the border. The problem is becoming increasingly serious for the Persians and it is understood that instructions have recently been received to close the frontier as far as possible against all Russian refugees, and the military posts on the frontier are being still further strengthened. Reports indicate that a considerable number of refugees are being turned back at the frontier. Accurate figures are not available but it is certain that very large numbers of Turcomans are entering Persia. 250/300 families are known to have arrived during April and individual refugees in large numbers. 16 Russians and 6 women entered Persia on the 23rd. There have certainly been very many more but figures cannot be obtained. A large number of Persian subjects resident in Russia have also returned to Persia* A Persian Turk refugee who recently arrived in Meshed from Askabad relates a gruesome story. He declares that an Armenian Restaurant Keeper at Askabad murdered 9 persons (presumably persons intending to cross the frontier) in 40 days, and served the flesh of the bodies in the restaurant. He has at last been detected and arrested. Refugees are now being subjected to a very strict examination and only those who are considered to be free of any suspicionof 'being G*P#U. agents are brought into Meshed* The fate of suspected persons is not known - they are probably kept in local prisons pending instructions* Although actual figures are not forthcoming, enquiries from many sources lead me to the conclusion that since Christmas 1932 not less than 3000 Turkomans and 500/600 Russians must have entered Persia via the Khorassan frontiers* 3* THE FAMINE IN RUSSIA * Reports of cannibalism in Russia have been received from widely differing sources. Railway stations are packed with helpless and starving people. It is stated that periodically these are searched and identification documents demanded. The majority are unable to produce such documents and are placed in locked goods wagons and sent out into desert land, being provided with neither food nor water. The corpses are subsequently thrown out into the desert, and others are disposed of by drowning in the Oxus. These reports are so general that, even allowing for exaggeration, they must have a good deal of real foundation. A pood of flour is said to cost 400 Roubles. A certain amount of wheat is being smuggled from Khorassan and sold at high prices. The quantity is insignificant and the Persians are at present not taking steps to stop it, as money is so scarce in the province that it is welcomed from any source. Soviet troops near the frontier, at any rate, and according to some reports elsewhere, are becoming dissatisfied and in many cases are not now issued with ammunition, rioting presumably being feared. At Merv large numbers are said to be existing only by eating grass.. ariasM ciat 9«xb .0*^.0 sn-tocf lo ni Jqejl vXcfBrfoiq an® \;©ri^ - awo/ui ion si efioa*i»q b&amp;tosqaua . r.i o i 3: w'.j . • ? all rise ac e htr I roof ■on't aBlTlwpflfj ,^cn Imafos dsuodJIA 3a if3f.;l eon If. j iriJ notsufonro rff &lt; J is:: eeerrLoa ‘ ^itBai ' • a*i®i^£ro*Tl aBa&amp;4ia(i}i ertf bIv el&amp;ie*! beiefae evsd •i~ T mot! fievlaoa*! nadcf avail *l38&amp;&amp; ni me IlBcflanBo *io s^oqaH • ° '&gt;•'nor zaf*re‘: 31 o v, l • • - ’ -v 5 ijIv*iB^e JbnB aaslqlari AJtw bedesq a«iB axiol^s^a badoTfiaa ®*ib aeailX ^IlBOiqoInsq Serif betefa al •slqoaq aiB \f Jt*iQt*m eriT . ^bnsmeb afaemt/oob noifanlJIfnebl bos bexonf ni beon£c o n dob : Jn mocn rioua 'oo.xyu. of &gt;Iaentt bent rone sniacf t z&gt;nBl Sneaei Snf- Sue fnoa bne one jsw fuco- Xltasupaadtoa ana aeacioo arif •vsfaw *ron booJ teriflea riflw !o besot?

This number nominated 25 persons from among themselves with the purpose that they may have a council and consult each other as to what is to be done in order to save the multitude from starvation and other difficulties; the idea was to find a benevolent Government which was prepared to take over the charge of protection of these miserable people* The council was at last convened and much discussion was made with no result* I can give in a separate paper a list of the names of the 25 delegates to whom I belonged* I was appointed by the Council on the 27th of the Russian month (sic) to go out of Turkestan for finding out some solution for the difficulties* Intending to reach the precincts of the protection of His Majesty's Government, I entered Afghaneaten under the plausible pretext of taking some goods to that country* No passage was allowed to me and Indeed I was repatriated to Turkestan where I was arrested by the Bolsheviks and was kept in prison for 2^ years and was every day tortured and threatened to be put to death because they accused me of having taken goods into British territory.I was recently releaaed and I hare with we now the certificate of release issued by the Bolsheviks. I returned to ay native land and again was approached on every side by ay g people with the urgent demand that I should go out for findin a way out of their pressing difficulties. I was given a new power of delegation and this tine I entered Xhurassan and tried to visit His Majesty’s Consul-General in Meshed but two men came and toojc my papers and did not allow me to go and see the officer in question. All ay expectations came to nothing and I did not hear any more from those two persons. fl white Russian told ae in the meantime that it was no good tnat I should place ay people under the sovereignty of the British Governaent and that before long a proper Government will be constituted inside Russia which could extend protection to us. Another individual from Tashkent told ae that a Governaent Council was to be convened in Turcomanestan with excellent prospects and he dissuaded ae of the intention to place myself and my people under the protection of His Majesty’s Government. I have now coae to Tehran with the intention of taking a passport which I have not been able yet to get. In the meantiae ay money was exhausted and against ay debts, which I could not pay, I waa put into prison for 8 months. I aa now out of prison and without money. I am really at my wit's end why I have not miserable been able to do anything for ay^people who wait with eager expectation to know the result of my steps. The only resource left to ae in my mind Is to address this petition to His Majesty's Legation and request that aoae way out of the difficulties pressing on my poor and exhausted people may be ahown to me.

Legation, Teheran.(s 584-3/646/34) 1 1932 Extract from Tabriz Political Diary No* 7, July, 1932• 14# Refugees:- The number of refugees escaping into Azerbaijan increased very much in July* It is reported that the total number of refugees who crossed into this Province via Astara, Mughan, Bilasavar, the Araxes near Julfa., and Arabian is estimated at about 200, of which number about 90^ are Moslem Tartars and the rest Armenians, Russians, Jews and Assyrians* While all the Christians and Jews were deported to Sulduz etc. together with some of the Moslems, most of the Tartar refugees have found occupation, it being harvest time, in the villages of the Mughan, Ardabil, Sariab, Mishkin and Khalkhal districts and have settled there for the time being. During July there arrived here via Julfa two more groups of Armenian Orphans who recently returned to Armenia from Greece* One group was composed of 9 persons* Among them was one who had come to the frontier with one of the former groups but had been afraid to cross the Araxes which was then very swift and so had returned to Erivan. Later he gathered 8 companions and with himself as guide they managed to make their way to the Araxes and cross the boundary safely. After being imprisoned here for a few days they were sent to the Archbishopric, where they were kept a few days and given some thing for their expenses to Sulduz. The other groupsbelieved to be composed of 14-15 persons was brought here but was never sent to the Archbishopric* It is believed that they were deported straightway to Sulduz, without being sent to the Archbishopric^as a result of Soviet pressure. It was rumoured during the closing days of July that®&gt; &lt;$&gt; a few Refugees were suspected of being Soviet agents and were M therefore handed over to the Soviets. There was, it is said, one Armenian or Russian among them, the others being Tartars. 16. It is further reported that the Russians have cleared large areas of wood on the Russo-Persian frontier near Astara, in places where refugees most easily escaped, and have placed machine guns there to try to check the rush of refugees. Many refugees were said to have been killed there recently while attempting to enter Persia.Sppy* fE 5844/646/34) 7. Extract from Tabriz Political Diary No« 8 » August 1932» Refugees : Refugees continued to pour into Azerbaidjan and their number passed 400 in August, a number unusual these last months. Of this number one group of armed Tartars on their way to Persia raided a Russian village and brought into Persia some mules and live stock. Soviet troops were sent after them who demanded from the Persians that they should either find and return the mules and cattle to them or hand over the refugees, threatening that in the contrary case they would themselves enter Persian territory to search for them. Upon this the Persians were much perturbed and they actually found and confiscated and gave to the Russians some of the mules and live stock in order to avoid conflict with the Soviets on the frontier. i^ Copy. (E 5845/646/34). Extract from Tabriz Political Diary No.9 . September 1932. (c). RUSSIANS: Caucasus. Refugees: The rush of refugees to Azerbaidjan continued in September. Besides several groups of poor people, 2 or 3 fighting groups of mixed Tartars and Armenians also succeeded in crossing the Araxes into Persia. They brought with them their horses, live stock, cattle, etc. Part of these were 'netted” by the Persians and disarmed but part managed to escape the Persian forces and retaining their arms, settled in Persian villages near the frontier. One I such group recrossed to Russia on a raid in the last days of September. Over the crossing into Persia of one of the above mentioned armed bands of refugees a small en counter occurred between Persian and Russian frontier guards, as the latter wanted to enter Persian territory in pursuit of the refugees. The Persians were said to have had several casualties and Dr. Eghiazarian of the Tabriz Military Hospital went to Khiav to attend to the wounded and returned after 3 days* absence only. The number of Armenian Orphan refugees, brought to Soviet Armenia from Greece last winter and spring, who have escaped into Persia reached 80 in September. Ten of these are still at Tabriz, and ten in Sulduz, where they are kept under strict control as the previous 60 had managed to cross to ^raq.P.Z. 4608/32 Extract from Meshed Intelligence Summary No. 7 for period 2. REFUGEES. There has been a marked decrease in the number of refugees from Soviet Russia; The Russians have latterly increased the strengths of their frontier posts and at the same time explained to the Persian Government that their reason for doing so was solely a desire to check the crossing of the frontier by unauthorised persons. The Persi&amp;i authorities, who, although they treat refugees with much consideration, find them a source of considerable trouble, are for once in cordial agreement with the Soviet authorities, and have also strengthened their frontier posts with the same object. ending 23rd June, 1932.Notes.

I also attach extracts from a report of a semi-personal nature, the result of a recent private tour in j£ast Persia, irom Ivjr. Busk of the Tshran Legation, which the Foreign Office jbave allowed me to see.3 . Mr. Roared Despatch of 20th July is self-explanatory and covers the ground. It will he seen that in North- Western Persia refugees from the Soviet Union into Azer o )T Baijan are treated in a humane manner and in view of the difficult position in which the authorities are placed hy this continued influx no object ion can he taken to the measures adopted^-/'*^ 4. As regards East Persia, the more deserving refugees, i.e. those Russians 'who are ’white' both physically and politically' often undergo considerable hardships until they reach Meshed and in particular suffer at the hands of the frontier officials who do their utmost to rob them of such valuables ad^hey may possess. Representations by Colonel Barrett, until recently Consul-General at Meshed, have done much to reduce this persecution. White Russians, once they reach Meshed, are not ill-treated and (subject to their bona fides being established) a White Russian organisation usually finds work for them. 5. The second class of refugee, are the Turkomans 'who migrate across the frontier sometimes in quite large bands with their women, children, animals and household goods.' The situation here is made difficult by the unruliness and lawless character of these refugees, by the reluctance of the Turkomans to settle peacefully in the areas allotted to them (at a distance from the frontier) and by the difficulty of preventing them from retaliatory measures against Soviet territory. His Majesty's Minister expresses the opinion that there is no question that they suffer great hardship and that even making allowance for the profession of a desire to ameliorate conditions by the G.O.C. at Meshed any improvement must be a matter of considerable time. ^A.

Sir, In response to the instructions obntained in the last paragraph of your despatch Ho. 214&gt;? Jinuary 11th last I have the honour to transmit, herewith, a copy of a despatch from the Acting British Consul at Tabriz dealing with the subject of the treatment accorded to refugees from the soviet Union by the Persian authorities in Azerbaijan. £• It will he observed from this report that the refugees are treated in a humane manner and in viev, of the difficult position in which the authorities are placed by this continued influx no objection caa be taken to the measures adopted. 3. Owing to the illness of Lieutenant-Colonel Barrett and his departure on sick leave no regular report is avail able from t'eshed. Major Daly has, however, transmitted to me some private notes on the question, Tdiile Mr. Busk, ?hird Secretary to this Legation, recently visited eshed and was able as a result of conversations with the members of the Staff of the Consulate-General to familiarise himself to oac extent with the position. ^ 4 . On the basis of ar. Busk's information ano/that of furnished by Major Daly the situation may be summarised as follows The refugees belong to two main groups, firstly Russians who are 'White' both physically and politically and fhe Right Honour** le Sir John Simon G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., fhe Foreign Office*- 2 - secondly Turkomans, who migrate across the frontier sometimes in quite large hands, with their women, children, animals and household goods* The former class often undergo considerable hardships until they reach Meshed* i-any of the frontier offiolals,who as often as not are in Soviet pay, make considerable sums by trafficking in refugees or by mulcting them of any valuables they may possess* As a result of private representation by Lieutenant-Colonel Barrett this persecution has, however, been considerably reduced* It is only fair to add that the white Hu slans are not ill-treated once they have reached Meshed* They ore usually imprisoned for ten days or so until their bona fldes have been established, l*e* until it has been proved that they are not QGHJ agents masquerading as refugees* After they have been released from Jail work is usually found for them by a White Russi n organisation at Meshed* The situation in regard to the Turkomans is complicated by the unruly and lawless character of these refugees* The policy of the Persian authorities is to settle them in districts sufficiently far from the frontier to ensure that they shall not raid Soviet territory md thus provoke pro tests and reprisals* This is unfortunately a policy with which the Turkoman? does not see eye to eye* He is unaccus tomed to recognise frontiers and when moved into the inter ior is apt to protest vehemently* The tribesmen also allege that they are given land which is entirely unsuitable for human settlement, but it must be remembered that the amount if good grazing or agricultural land in Persia is limited andand the better areas are already occupied. Complaints are *ilso made that the tribesmen are forced to males long marches to their new quarters without proper provision of supplies or I protection against heat and cold. That they suffer great | hardship la unquestionable, but the General Officer Coipmanding j Wh0 haB aiso hs8ed the matter with members of the staff of His Kajesty's Consulate-Oeneral.professea a sincere dosire to ameliorate the conditions under which the Turkomans are I settled. He points out, however, that this process must inevitably be a very alow one and this is a oonclusion with t v/hioh i find myself in agreement* Tne worat aspect of the matter is the shameless manner in which refugeea are systematically plundered at the frontier for the benefit of the officials and their friends and I am requesting Major Daly to make private representations on this point as and when opportunity offers. 5 * A8 y° u '• “ware His i&amp;jesty's Pice Consulate at “esht is at present closed and it is therefore not possible to submit a report on the treatment of refugees in that consular district.

W, DAVIS, aCTfTCO BRITISH CONSULEXTRACT PROM A PRIVATE HiPORT FROM MR. BUSK, THIRD SECRETARY, TEHRAN, TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE, ON A RECENT (^CLyuU.hL^iJIOUR IN EAST PERSIA. ****** .... The,Persian frontier officials are largely in the pay of the Russians ana many of the officials both civil and military at meshed benefit directly or indirectly from bribes.- This is particularly the case in regard to the unfortunate refugees who cross the frontier in considerable numbers. These are in two main classes, first Russians who are rt white” both physically and politically and secondly Turkomans who migrate across the frontier sometimes in quite large bands with their women, children, animals and household goods. The former class often have an appalling time until they reach meshed. 'Iraj Khan the local 3artip is venal and corrupt to the nth aegree ana he ana the frontier officials make considerable sums by trafficking in refugees. The method is simple; if the unfortunate victim has any valuables he is mulcted and allowed to proceed. -•If he has none he is sold back to the Russians. I discussed this question with Stevens who is acting as Secretary during Camber's absence and we agreed that it would be very difficult and even impossible for us to take any steps to remedy this deplorable situation. Barrett*s previous protest to the Jam appears to have reduced ill-treatment of refugees to a minimum but so long as 'Iraj Khan remains at meshed little can be accomplished. It is only fair to add that the &lt;Vhite Russians are not ill-treated once they have reached meshed. They are usually imprisoned for ten days or so until their bona fides/fides tiave deen established, i.e. until it has been proved that they are not G.P.U. agents masquerading as refugees. After they have been released from jail,work is usually found for them by a White Russian organization at Iweshed. tony of the refugees are German colonists who still retain to a surprising extent the language ana customs of their forbears. They have migrated from villages in the Caucasus where they were settled over one hundred and fifty years ago; rrany speak only German and they cane of a haray peasant stock. The German negation at Tehran has repatriated most of these unfortunate folk with the assistance of a German called Franqui at Leshedwho was very highly spoken of by the Barretts, - he is the representative there of the firm of Wonckhaus. The refugees are for the most part being settled in East Prussia where they are doing very well. Some, however, (those who have a little money) are emigrating to Canada. Hamber has of late developed considerable interest in the Turkoman refugees, interest which I am inclined to consider exaggerated and unnecessary. Stevens, I feel certain, shares my view but is of course reluctant to criticise the opinions of his predecessor. I append (Annex A) a copy of a note given me by Steven? which places the situation on record* I entirely agree with his remarks in the penultimate paragraph and consider that any interference on our part would only complicate the situation. * Iraj Khan, despicable though he f ^ undoubtedly is, is in no easy position; if he leaves the Turkomans near the frontier the Russians make things | unpleasant for him and he may even lose his job through^ their pressure; if he moves the Turkomans away from the 1 frontier they complain very bitterly and, being gentlemen of no manners or morals, make life extremely difficult for I their unhappy neighbours, who in consequence complain even more vigorously. The essential trouble is that the Turkoman does not take kindly to aiscipline and recognises no frontiers. Until he has been tamed, - and that day is far distant - there will always be trouble wherever he is.A n n e x: A » Turkoman Refugees * Hamoer raised the question, very iniormally, at tea one day with sartip Iraj Khan, and the three of us discussed the question at some length. Hamher passed on to Iraj Khan a complaint which had been made to him making it quite clear that he know nothing as regards the justice or otherwise of the complaint. This started a general discussion of the subject. Iraj Khan professed great sympathy with the Turkomans, but added that they were difficult people to deal with. He expressed, as his personal view, what is in reality, I think, the Persian official view. He said: (a) The Turkomans are a wild lot and cannot be driven, (b) They are all bandits and smugglers at heart and therefore want to settle as near the frontier as possible.. He quoted an instance where the Persian authorities had offered to move a certain group of Turkomans (who had complained of the barrenness of their surroundings) to a fertile district, but one far from the frontier. The Turkomans refused. (c) This attitude made things very difficult for the Persian Government vis-a-vis the Russians, who were continually complaining that Turkomans were being allowed to settle near the frontier and were not kept in order. 'Iraj Khan went on to say that he was shortly going on tour and that he hoped very much to be able to submit a concrete proposal to the Persian Government regarding the amelioration of conditions for the Turkomans, He thought it would be a long business; that schools should be opened for them, that they should gradually be educated and absorbed into the country. But he anticipated that thirty years would elapse before his plan bore any tangible results. Hamber/Hamber thought very little of Iraj Khan’s promise to go into things, and regarded the whole thing as an evasion. (I think he's probably right. At the same time, there is no doubt that the Turkomans are a source of trouble, and that to a large degree they have only themselves to thank). Iraj Khan has now returned; when I get a favourable opportunity I will talk to him again on the subject and ask if he has got any further with his plan.P.Z. 2777/32 Copy Extract from Meshed Intelligence Summary No. 3 for period ending 10th March, 1932. 2.

His Excellency* s face fell a little when I opened the matter, but he stronply denied that any refugees, European or Asiatic, had been handed back to the Russian Government. He added moreover that the case of every Individual refugee had boon referred to him for orders by Barhang I raj Khan, Coramanillng the troops In Khorasan. 3. This Is the official attitude and I have no doubt that His Excellency himself has not willingly handed over any refugee to his death. Khorasun, however, has a very long frontier with Russia and It Is impossible for either the Governor General or the Officer Coramand- Ing troops to know everythin/; that goes cm at the small frontier posts, 4, I have little doubt that the military authorities will be Informed of the conversation and that for a time at least more attention will be paid to the correct treatment of refugees, 5, I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Government of India.

Meanwhile certain further papers have been received on the subject. P.Z.8076/31. (1) As regards Khorassan, at the end of October Soviet troops raided into Persian territory, coming into conflict with the Persian Guards, and killing some Turkoman refugees and carrying off others. The Persian Government has protested to Moscow and ordered a local enquiry. The covering despatch from the British Minister of 2 December suggests thatthat Persian behaviour in the matter of refugees is influenced by the Persian Government’s fear of the Soviet. . Conditions on the North East frontier of Persia are very disturbed. There was recently a Turkoman rebellion in Soviet territory (which may perhaps have been one of the causes producing an influx of refugees) and there is now a Turkoman mutiny (said to be assisted by the Soviet) in Persian territory. (2) A despatch of 23 November deals with the cases of refugees who enter Persia via Turkey-from Transcaucasia and those who enter in the Astarabad district. It does not add anything material to previous information. P.Z.273/32 (3) The despatch of 13 December however forwards a report of 23 November from Resht which makes unpleasant reading. Russian refugees occasionally in the summer escape across the Caspian and arrive at the Persian port of Pahlevi. It appears that some of these who arrived in this way last August were deported back to Russia in the middle of November. It would appear from this that the policy of surrendering refugees who arrive illegally is $ still sometimes followed, though the memorandum from Tabriz of 29 September stated that this policy adopted by the local authorities in the spring of t 3 t/)U j ' GOIVJi*, TEE. 1931 had very soon been changed and that more lately ^ 7 1932 !\ no cases of surrenders had been heard of. It is to be hoped that the suggestion which the Minister has been authorised to make to the Persian M.F.A. may have some effect not only on the behaviour of the local authorities but on the policy of the Persian Government in so far as this may be necessary. ^ 33 ^ ^ ~ ^ ^ SEEN■Mi 5 t^s^u»8^£ie»se quote In any further comrm No. and address —not to any person by njimt, but to- “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W i. i * a. ; 29i - I C V o THE Under-Secretary of State f^._JF|^ign ;Affaij^i presents hia compliments to tt\fi distil and, by direction pf the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop/P* of the under-mentioned paper.

Sir With reference to the second paragraph Of that some Russian refugees who escaped across the Caspian Sea last summer in small boats and came to Bandar Pahlavi have now been sent back to Russia by the Persian Police authorities. The refugees in question came from the vicinity of Lenkoran in two small boats. The boats have been confiscated by the Persian Government and are now in Pahlavi, The occupants were arrested by the Police on their arrival, in the latter half of August, and were kept in prison until the middle of this month. They were then escorted by the Police to the quay and put on board the Russian mail steamer ,, Pomin , ‘, where doubtless the Russian authorities took charge of them. There were pitiful scenes on the quay when the refugees were put on board the boat, the men trying to escape from their escort while the women threw themselves on the ground imploring for mercy and asking to be killed rather than be sent back to Russia. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) A. W. Davis. R. fl.

I.—KHORASAN. Persian Affairs. 1. Military. —The 17th of December was celebrated as the foundation day of the Bahrami Regiment. Sarhang Iraj Khan, the Amir Lashkar and other offi cials attended a ceremony to comme morate the occasion. A telegram of congratulation from the Shah was read. Sultan Kaji Khan, Commander of the troops at Bakharz on the Afghan fron tier has been appointed commander of troops at Kuchan. Naib Arsalan Mirza has been sent to replace him. 2. Conscription. —On the loth of De cember 1,02 &gt; new conscripts arrived in Meshed cantonment (Shehr-i-Nau). This is the final number of accepted recruits from Meshed of this number 220 have been retained and the remainder sent back to their homes with instructions that they are liable for service if re quired. It seems doubtful if there is sufficient equipment for more than the number now retained. 3. Soviet activities. —(i) The Control Commission whose impending arrival might possibly have been connected with the recent burning of the local premises of the Sharq Company (Summary 22/9, iii) duly arrived in Meshed and after an enquiry proceeded to Tehran. (ii) The new Soviet Consul General arrived in Meshed a few days ago. He called on H. B. M.’s Consul General on the 28th instant. His name is Solomon Lazarevitch Borisov. A portly Hebrew who has already been employed in Persia a year or two ago in the Soviet Cepartment of Commerce. He has travelled extensively in Persia also in China. He speaks some English. He has brought with him an official, it is believed a Vice-Consul, to relieve Degtyarig who will leave shortly. His name has not yet been ascertained. He is by appearance also a Jew. (iii) Hussein Aga Kashanski, a Per sian formerly an Attache at the Soviet Consulate General, Meshed has returned after a long absence. He is reported to be seeking re-employment. (iv) A persistent bazaar rumour pre vails that the Soviet intends to import a large numb&amp;t 1 motors in the near future whibh dvill sell at ^dumping price. It is s^fid they are Vords., Further en quiries are being made! I D^ted 17 Mak 1932 | Rooeivea 4 APR. 1932' 4. Communications. —Considerable re cent construction has taken place on the Meshed-Tehran road via Sabzewar and Damgan. Russian Engineers have been incharge of the work which has been really well done in several places. Not ably between Sabzewar and Tehran where, with gaps of unmetalled track in places, the road is well aligned and broad. A car can average 30 miles an hour for several miles. Garages (which also take the place of Dak Bungalows) and petrol supplies are frequent. II—CENTRAL ASIAN SOVIET REPUBLICS. 5. Military —An individual who left Perovsk (Kizil Orda or Ak Mechet) on the 3rd of December reports as follows:— Garrison — Strength about Cavalry . Artillery . , Infantry . . 1,500 . 300 . 200 No identifica tion known. . 1,000 G. P. V. about 60. Commandant Speen. 6. Conscription.—This is in force throughout Kazakistan. Recruits are sent to Alma Ata. 7. Administrative —Perovsk was the capital of Kazakistan until 1927 when the seat of Gove nment was moved to Alma Ata. One of the chief causes was the extreme dampness of Perovsk which has caused great damage to all the Gov ernment buildings and barracks. 8. General. —Christmas day was to be celebrated by the blowing up of all churches which were not being used as public buildings in order to prevent any celebrations on that day. 'Electoral Reform. —The new franchise scheme in which peasants are only to be represented in the Republic and Central Soviets on a basis of village representa tion as opposed to actual population has caused widespread discontent. It is argued that the workers in the towns who are assessed on a population basis will have quite disproportionate representation in camparison with the peasants who will not have more than one member per 50,000. The Kolkhoz workers are threatening to strike if this reforms is put into effect.2 10. Aerodromes. —(i) There is-jyi tensive aerodrome at Perovsk on the - river bank. No aircraft is stationed there though aeroplanes occasionally land from Tashkent. (ii) The informant staped for three days at Tashkent on his way out of U. S. S. ft- during which time 5 aero planes arrived from Moscow. These were 4 seater new machines, which were said to be carrying out a test flight. They flew on towards Dushambe but returned the day he left and again departed for Moscow. (iii) The G. P. U. is collecting a sum of money from all workers for the con struction of a gigantic statue of Lenin to be erected on the sea shore at Kronstadt. (iv) There have been extensive changes in the staff of the G. P. U. throughout Turkistan. (This is confirmed from other sources). It seems that the action of \ many officials of the G. P. U. during the !. recent Turkistan rebellion was not consi- | dered satisfactory. I 11. Military.—Axv informant who left Kerki on the 27th of November reports as follows:— Garrison .— Infantry .. 1,200. Identification not known. Cavalry .. 125. (One squadron. The in formant states this to be part of the 3rd T. M. R. Division. Po sibly the Division al Cavalry Squadron). Artillery .. 1. Battery. (No 19 given. I cannot identify).

Conscription .—This is not yet end ed.' • The informant heard that about 300 conscripts had been enrolled and sent to Charjui. 13. Armament etc.— Small guns Large guns Machine guns Wireless sets Searchlight 6 3 8 2 1 On the mound of Imam Jaffar Sul tan. Lights the river to watch smugglers. 14. Aerodrome .—Located b et w e e n Samsonov and Kerki. Equipped with wireless. No aircraft are stationed there. Planes land once a week from Charjui. 15. Refugees .—About 1,000 Turkoman families have crossed into Afghanistan during the last four months. Several have done so to avoid conscription. 16. Gas Training .—This is carried out once a week by the garrison at the Teppe of Imam Jaffar Sultan. 17. Morale of Troops .—This is said to be poor. They are discontented with their condition and the treatment of their families. 18. Propaganda Bureau .—An execu - tive propaganda bureau exists in KerkL Agents who receive their training in Moscow are sent into Afghanistan to preach sedition against Nadir Shah. All the Agents are orientals with a thorough knowledge of the Afghan language. 19 Collectivization.— Is in force throughout the Kerki district. Cotton is grown. 20. General .—The Oxus has been very low recently. Steamers cannot reach Kerki from 'Charjui, in places the river can even be forded. Trade between Soviet Russia and Afghanistan seems to be temporarily at a stand still. Soviet and Afghan rela tions in this neighbourhood are strain ed.. III.—HERAT. Nothing of interest to report. L.

Persian Affairs. Military. 1. Burjnurd Rebellion. —The situation in this district seems now to be settled. It is very improbable that there will be any further trouble at any rate durirg the winter. A reinforcement of about 100 men dressed in Turkoman custume joined the rebels about the 12th or 14th of November. It seems that the reported detachment of 2,000 Volunteers raised in Askhabad has not materialized other than as above mentioned. Two or three small skirmishes took place during the first ten days of Novem ber and on the 16th and 17th major operations were undertaken by the Persian troops against the rebels. In a two days’ battle in which both sides are stated to have suffered heavy casualties the rebels were driven back across the Soviet frontier and the band seems to have been finally broken up. The troops from Tehran and Astarabad have been withdrawn, but the detach ment from Meshed is remaining for the present in the Burjnurd District. 2. Trouble in Arabistan. —Unconfirm ed information dated the 2nd December reports a rising among Arabs who are Persian subjects. The locality is not known but thought to be in Arabistan. It is said that the detachment from Tehran which was withdrawn from Gumbad-i-Kabus has been moved to south-west Persia and that a wire has been received in Meshed demanding the despatch of a contingent from there also. Further particulars are awaited. 3. Troop movements. —The Lutfabad garrison was reinforced by 20 Cavalry sowars on the 22nd November, and the Bajgiran garrison by 15 on the 30th. 50 Infantry were sent from Meshed to Kuchan in lorries on the 24th November to strengthen the garrison there. 4. Conscription. —Conscription has been started in Sabzewar from the 20th November. Many complaints have been received against the Conscription Officers in Turbat-i-Haidari. Two officers have been sent frem Meshed to cany out an enquirv. I 'd 5. deal of quarreling going' on amongst officers Dated 17 MAR. 1932 Recel.ea 4 APR. 1932 of the Eastern Army. Sarhang Iraj Khan, tbe Amir Lashkar does not seem to be much of a disciplinarian. The Governor of Kuchan is complain ing against the Officer Commanding troopi of that place Sayid Jalal Khan. He has also protested to the Governor General. Sultan Mahmud Khan, Commanding the Infantry at Bwrjnurd has come to Meshod to complain against Sarhang Ali Reza Khan, the Officer Commanding troops. Yavar Akhmad Khan Tahir Nia has been appointed Adjutant of the truops in Meshed. 6. Communications. —The road from Neshupore to Sabzewar which was damaged for a distance of 80 Kilometers by recent heavy rains and is being repaired. 7. Persian Officials. —Asadi, the head of the Meshed Shrine returned from Tehran on the 28th November. Aun Jazari-ul-Sultaneh, Assistant Governor of Meshed died suddenly on the 23rd of November. The Bolsheviks lost a good worker. 8. Foreigners. —The Turkish Minister in Kabul left for Meshed on the 2nd of November via Kandahar and Herat. It is not known if he has arrived yet. He is said to bo returning to Kabul via India. Professor Masse, a French Archaeologist is at present staying in Meshed. 9. Soviet Activities. —(i) Four Russians of the Khlopkom (Cotton Industries) who recently went to S tbzew^ar ostensibly to buy cotton have been engaging in pro paganda. The Police have ordered three of them to return to Meshed forth with. (ii) In connection with the 14th anni versary of the revolution the Soviet Government informed the Persian Gov ernment that all prisoners in the Soviet Jails who are Persian subjects were to be released the number is about 1,000 some of them have already reached Persia. (Hi) On the night of the 25th/26th of November the Sharq Company burnt down their premises, one of the largest buildings in Meshed the property of Nasirbegcff (A wealthy Persian mer chant who deserved a better fate sincehe had always worked well for the Bolsheviks). The loss is estimated ab Tomans 20,000. All their documents and accounts were unfortunately destroyed, they saved however their furniture including a grand piano. Their goods had been very fortunately moved to some new premises across the road two days previously. The fact that an Audit Commission was due to arrive from Askhabud has, one must assume no connection with this affair. 10- Economic .—Owing to incomplete information only being available regard ing the conditions of the Persian-Soviet trade agreement incorrect particulars were given in the last Summary No. 21, paragraph 5, where it was stated that the Persian Government had reserved for themselves the monopoly of the supply of Sugar and Matches. They have only reserved the selling monopoly of these articles in Persia. The Soviet Government has obtained the absolute monopoly for the import of these articles. 11. Refugees .—Twenty Turkoman re fugees crossed the frontier at Lutfabad on the 15th of November and another 9 reached Kuchsn on the 26th. 12. General .—Compulsory vaccination is being instituted in Meshed. 16 Vacci nators are at work amongst the poor children in the town. II.— Soviet Central Asian Republics. 13. Basmachi —The rebellion in Turkistan has been put down with the greatest severity. Intensive Air action against the families of the Turkomans considered to have taken part in the rebellion, has finally crushed the rising. The casualties sustained among the women and children are very heavy. In the Merv-Tejend district alone these exceed 1,000 killed. The open nature of the terrain facilitated air action and the Auls were subjected to concen trated machine gun fire from low flying aircraft, groups which scattered were persued and shot down. An eye witness states that the planes flew so low that the buttons of the avaitors could be dis tinguished. At the present time wholesale deporta tions of the families of Turkomans from the neighbourhood of M^rv, Charjui and elsewhere are being undertaken. Motor convoys remove the entire population of the Auls and take them to the towns. The sarais at Merv are paeked with Turkomans and their families under guard. These are sent off by train to unknown destinations. It is said to the Solevetski camp or Siberia. It seems to be the determination of tlj^ Soviet Authorities to make a no manFS land of the territory between the railway and the Persian and Afghan frontiers. 14. Kushk.—An individual who left Kushk on the 2nd of November reports as follows :— Garrison—(i) Strength about 2,500. This includes 300 cavalry. The In fantry includes one b ittalion of Tartars. (No identifications). Artillery 6 small- gun,* 2 large, Machine guns Id. ^pre sumably Regimental Artillery). (ii) G. P. TF. —Strength about 100. Distributed as follows : —- Kushk . . . .20 Kara Teppe . . .40 Chehil Dukhteran . . 40 R°cently 60 soldiers in addition to the G. P. U. were sent to Kara Teppe and it is proposed to send a military detach ment to Chehil Dukhteran. AH these posts are connected with Kushk by telephone. (iii) Conscription. —This is being carried on in Kushk. Conscripts Irom the country round are brought to Kushk and Takhta Bazaar and subsequently sent to Charjui. (iv) Communications. —There are tw r o wireless sets, one Military and the other for the G. P. U. There is in addition a large wireless station which dates from the Czarist times. The informant reports that there are several sets of wireless telephones w r hich are used by the Military during manoeuvres and for communication with aircraft. One military areoplane arrived in Kushk from Tashkent shortly before the informant left. It carried out daily reconnaissance flights. (v) Fortifications .—Kushk is w r ell fortified. It is surrounded by walls on three sides whilst the forth is closed by a perimeter consisting of six fortified post connected by a continuous barbed wire entanglement. These strong points are joined up by an underground passage and telephones. At intervals in the passages are raised emplacements for machine guns. These six posts have names of which the informant can only remember three ; Baluch post, Poltaratsk post and Alexander post. These posts and the.defences have recently been put into a good state of repair. There are also outlaying earthworks. A gun emplacement is also being prepared on the hills above Kushk. * (vi) Water supply. —Water is brought into the town and fort by karezes from the hills. There is a large reservoir inside the perimeter from which a piped supply distributes water to all the barracks etc. (vi) Lighting. —The fort, town and perimeter are lit by electricity. (vii) Aerodrome. —This is located near Balasar fort. A building is being erected on this site. (viii) Station. —One verst from the fort. A siding runs into the town. It is said that there is an underground passage to the station from the fort built in Czarist times. Three fresh sidings are being made at the station, 2,000 men are at present employed on earthwork. (ix) Stores. —Large stores are main tained, these include w r heat, barley and lucerne. III.— Herat. The following information was supplied by an individual who left Herat on the 8th November. 15. Garrison. — (i) Infantry. —Two units the strength of which are 600 and 800 respectively. They are called the “ Khaka ” and the “ Kandhar ” Regi ments. (ii) Cavalry .—Four (?) squadrons, strength 100 each located as follows :— Herat 2 Squadrons, Opposite Kariz on the Persian frontier 1 squadron. Opposite Kushk 1 squadron. There are also two troops of reserve cavalry. (iii) Artillery. —Two Batteries. (iv) Armament. —The troops are armed with various types of rifles. One unit with British, one with Russian, one with German and one with Afghan made rifles, etc. 16. Aerodrome. —This is located 2 miles from the town. There is a store building on the site and guard is main tained. Occasionally aeroplanes land from Kabul. 17. Sale of Arms. —There is no restric tion on the sale of arms or ammunition. Rifles are sold openly in the bazaars. Nearly all the inhabitants are armed. The following is the price of rifles :— tomans. Rs. English Magazine Rifle with 100 rounds . . . 200 (400) Russian Magazine Rifle with 100 rounds . . .150 (300) 18. Junaid'.Khan. —Junaid Khan and his followers are living in Herat. They have not been disarmed and are behav ing themselves peaceably. 19. Soviet Consulate. —This is located outside the town. The Soviet is regard ed with extreme suspicion. Afghan merchants wishing to purchase Russian goods have to obtain official permission to visit the Soviet Consulate, which is guarded by Afghan troops. An individual who disobeyed these orders recently was nailed by the ear to the wall of the market place for four days as a punishment. 20. Soviet Trade. —Russian merchan dise fills the bazaars in Herat. British goods are not able to compete in this market cn account of the cost of trans port. Russian goods are brought by motor to Kara Teppe on the frontier and thence by camel caravan to Herat. The Soviet Consul is reported to arrange for the sale of foreign currency, pounds, dollars and rupees at very cheap rates. The town is said to be full of foreign paper money. I am informed that pound notes can be bought for Krans 25 (Rs. 4-8-0) if obtained in a quiet manner. There seems little doubt that this currency is Soviet forged and disposed of in [this manner. It is said these notes are sent through to India via Chaman. 21. Aaifr Salar Ahdur Lahim. —The present ruler of the Herat province is popular and respected. He does not seem to have lost local prestige by sub mission to the Kabul Government. Politically he is a good Afghan ex tremely suspicious of foreigners regardless of nation. He definitely dislikes the Russians and gives them very little freedom of movement. L. G. W. HAMBER, Major, Secretary to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Meshed. GEPD—973(c) F&amp;PD—11-3-32— 12 &lt;P.Z. 687 IV Extract from Meshed Consular Diary No. 21. period ending 15th November, 1931. for the v &gt;1 45S. Rottenness at Headquarters is reflected on the frontier, where Commanders are bribed and the Russians show the utmost contempt for Persian territory. Not only do they pursue Turkoman fugitives across^the frontier hot foot, but they have organised deliberate raids within Persian limits to kidnap or kill refugees, who are 8 or 10 miles inside the supposed safety line. For instance on 31st OcuObei the Russians raided Gulkhandan, v/here 25 families ox Turkoman refugees were residing under Persian guard. The Russians killed some of the Turgom-sns and took away 5 as prisoners. The Persian guard fired on the Russians and a fight ensued resulting in casualties on both sides. The next G.P.U. agents came to the village kidnapped 2 refugees and killed 2 others. This incident ha.s been reported to Tehran. The estimable Governor General says that the real, fault lies with the frontier Turkomans and Kurds v/ho act as G.P.u. egents. He ciid not state whether he held the Russians themselves as guiltless.Ho. 666. 23rd November, 1931 British Legation, Tehran. Sir, With reference to my despatch No. 635 of November 11th regarding the treatment in Persia of refugees from the Soviet Union, I have the honour to transmit to you, herewith: —• (a) an extract from the monthly diary of His Majesty*s Consul at Tabris, —— (b) a despatch from the Acting Vice Consul at Reaht 2. The Tabriz extract should be read in eon junction with Section 12 of Mr* Consul Palmer* s report enclosed in my despatch under reference. 3. Mr. Vice Consul Davis* despatch deals with a form of escape from the Soviet Union (by ees across the Caspian) which I understand to bs used occasionally by desperate persons. Loss of life is said to be not Infrequent as s result. The enclosure to the despatch shows that in some instances at any rate, refugees in the Asterabad district have not been too badly treated. 4.

Several such refugees consisting of Tartar Moslems and some Armenians were reported to have left for Turkey from the Caucasus in October. Some of the Moslems and the few Armenians later crossed to Persia, while the great majority of the Moslems settled in Turkey, where they were granted facilities by the Authorities. As usual, those who entered Persia were arrested and imprisoned for a few days, after which they were again released, but ordered to leave Azerbaijan for Kazvin, Isfahan, e tc. These refugees reported that the Turkish Authorities treat refugees from Russia with great kindness. In one ease while a group of such men were crossing to Turkey, the Russian Frontier Guards saw them and fired, killing 2 while the rest crossed safely. Vllien this was reported to the Head of the Turkish Frontier Guards of the region he rebuked the Turkish Guards, saying that they should have replied, firing towards Russian territory, as the Russians had no right whatever to fire towards the Turkish side of the Frontier.

Hoare* Esquire* C.M.G.* His BritannAe Majesty 1 ! Minister* British Legation* Slnee August last I have heard of no fresh arrivals Tehran.Translation? Aclarabad# Hovaiaber 4th, 1931. In reply to your letter No. 436, I beg to report that a number of fugitive Russian subjects arrived at Bandar-i-Qez and were kept there some time. Afterwards they were permitted by Colonel Hakimi, the Offleer Commanding Troops at Aetarabad, to go to the Yamut Turkoman steppe to carry on agriculture. Some of them went to Gunbad-i~Qabus and some to the Jatfarbal country. Some time later they wanted to import agricultural machinery, but Colonel Hakimi sent strict orders to all military officers in the Yamut area to suspend the activities of newly arrived persons as these would be obliged to leave the area. The fugitives remained in suspense for a time while a report was sent to Tehran. Then the Colonel received instructions to keep the fugitives under observation and allow them to settle, but not all in one place. Accordingly the Military Governor of the Turkoman Sahra helped the fugitives and allowed 8-6 households of them to settle in the YANQAQ. tribe of the KUKLAN, sixteen miles south of Gunbad»i«Qabus. They are now building houses there and beginning to eultivat* j tobacco, cotton, potatoes, wheat and barley. The results up to date have been excellent, the land there being very fertile. A number of the fugitives have also begun to cultivate wheat, barley and cotton in the JA*PARBAI country.

Buijnird .—The situation remains still uncertain with regard to future developments. A further 350 troops arrived from Tehran since the time of writing the last Summary, also another aeroplane. The mutineers have icceived considerable reinforcements from Soviet territory. Persian sources reported them to reach a total of about 750 men. not including the original mutineers. The Yamut Turkomans are stated to have more or less given up opposition to the Persian forces, instructions have been issued to treat those who surrender with clemency after they have been disarmed. A four days operation was undertaken against the mutineers on the oOoh/nist of October till the 2nd of November. The Persians are reported to have driven back the mutineers rnto the hills, though they suffered casualties to the extent of 20 killed and many wounded in the process. The rebels who were armed with two machine guns by the Soviet, are stated to have suffered heavy casualties. Vakil Bashi Ali Reza Khan their leader being wounded. A Naib Sarh vug (Lt.-Colonel) Ali Reza Khan was also wounded and arrived in Meshed on the 3rd of Nov ember. After the action Persian sourefs re ported that the numbers of the muti neers appeared to have decreased, and that it was rumoured that the Soviet had decided not to afford them any further assistance. It was therefore anticipated that the trouble would be cleared up in a week. Information however, has been receiv ed on the 10th of November that the rebels who are now stated to number about 450 have entrenched themselves in the ’hills (presumably to the north of Gumbad-i Kabus), and are being rationed from Soviet territory, their morale has improved and it would seem that they expect reinforcements. enclosure | INDIA. FOREIGN SEC Letter the period ending 12th November 1931. Information from an independent source from Askbabad dated the 4th November states that it has been decided to render further assistance to the rebel lion, and that a detachment numbering 2,000 Peisians, Armenians and Caucasians has been despatched for this purpose. They are dressed in Turkoman costume. Events during the next few days will confirm whether this information is true or false. 2. Zutfabad .—Another flagrant inst ance of Soviet invasion of Persian terri tory occurred on the 31st of October and the 1st of November at the village of Gaukhandan, 8 miles in Persian terri tory between Lutfabad and Mohammad- abad. Considerable numbers of Turkoman refugees have been crossing into Persia on this part of the frontier. 25 families which had come across some day&lt; before were quartered in the sarai of this village under Persian Military guard, when suddenly on the 31st a party of about 200 regular so’diers of the Red army entered the village killing many of the Turkomans and carrying off others into Soviet territory. An engagement took pi ce between the Persian guard and the Russians resulting in 5 Soviet and 7 Persian soldiers being killed. Dining the raid the village of Kila Mir was also looted. It D established the Soviet troops came fiom Artik via Zarrin Kuh. At 8 a.m. the next morning the villacm was again raided by 18 Turkomans of the G. P. U and another two refugees were killed and two more taken off to the frontier where they were shot. The Persian Government has protested to Moscow, and a full enquiry has been ordered. This is being carried out by Sultan Bayuk Khan, Commander of the troops at Lutfabad. There is little doubt that many Persian frontier officials and even Military officers are in the payment of the G. P. U. and the raid had consider able assistance from the Persian side of the border. 3. The Commander of troops at Khaf and Burjnurd who came to Meshed for the Race meeting of the Eastern Army on the 2nd of November have returned. IN p r -v(kP' , U : , \ [186 S312 Sarhang Akhmad Khan, Persian Military Attache at Kabul has come to Meshed on leave. 4. The following suggestions put up by the Officer Commanding troops Burjnurd (Yavar Ali Reza Khan) to the Shah have been approved :— (i) To increase the garrison along the Soviet fio.itier in the Tjrkoman country. (ii) To maintain Military detach ments in the Goklan and Yamut areas. (iii) To purchase three lorries for cases of military emergency. (iv) That the Burjnurd Regiment should be composed of recruits from all districts of Khorasan and not only of local inhabitants. 5. Economic .—The Scviet-Persian Commercial treaty has at last been signed on the 27th of October. It is stated that the Trade Monopoly Laws of both contracting parties are to be recognised. Lists of goods sanctioned by this agreement together with the annual maximum value authorised in each case have been prepared. Sugar and Matches however have been reserved as a monopoly of the Persian Government. This would appear to be a serious blow to Rnssi i»n exports which comprised a very large quantity of both these articles. It is perfectly certain that the Persian Government is not in a position to meet the requirements of their country in either of these commodities, however it is aii ill wind that blows nobody any good and the Frontier Customs Officials will reap a rich harvest from authorised smugglers of these goods. The fact that the inhabitants of Persia will suffer from shortage and increased prices of these necessities is the last factor to receive official consideration. A circular has been issed to Gover nors of Provinces to effect that m rchants are forbidden to trade in any articles prohibited by the Monopoly Law. I his order will no doubt be turned to profitable account by the officials con cerned by permitting certain privileged merchants to cany on trading in a small way in forbidden merchandise. Cotton crop. -The cotton crop has not been good in Khorasan this year. 7. Persian Officials —Asadi, the Head of the Shrine of Imam Reza, has left for Gumbad-i-Kabus in the Astarabad area. It is rumoured that this journey is^| connection with a proposed visit by Shah to this ana, where presumably he will obtain first hand know ledge of the trouble in the Burjnurd, Astarabad districts. The Shah is at present tour ing in Mazanderan. 8. Soviet activities .—The Head of the Khlopkom (Soviet Cotton Industries), together with five Russians has left Meshed for Sabzewar. The Mesheh Rais-i-Nazmieh suspects they have really gone to organize propaganda, and has telegraphed to the local police to keep a close watch on their movements. 9. Soviet Officials .—New Secretary to the Soviet Consulate, Meshed, has arriv ed. His name is Lazarchenko, a Ukrainian. He takes up the post of first Secretary which has now been vacated by Degtyarig, who has been appointed “ Director ” (Upravlyauschi). It seems probable that no C nsul General will be appointed in place of Skaloff, and the existing arrangement will remain in action for an indefinite period. Conversation with Di'gtyarig on the occasion of the celebration of the 14th anniversary of the Revolution elicited information that it is not Soviet po.icy to retain a regular Consular service, and that any official may be sent to hold an} 7 suitable post either inside or outside the frontiers of the U. S. S. R. (n) Danilov, the Head of the Sharq, w is at the above entertainment. He is the chief of the local G. P, U. and evil looking pock marked mirnmal with, it is said, several murders to his credit. An Armenian, speaks French and a little English stated to me he was in England for eight months in 1912. He is the shepherd of the political conduct of Soviet officials in Meshed, and one gathers the impression he is hated and feared by them. ^ a • w iron Daragaz, dated the 27th of October dU Turkomans from Tejend fought ai action with Soviet frontier guards nea Artik, and having incurred some casual ties entered Persian territory via Safi K da and Zarrm Kuh.

Basmachi. —(i) There is little doubt that the rebellion in Turkistan has been more or less suppressed. This does not mean that further incidents will not occur, but at the moment the Soviet forces have scattered the greater part of the rebel groups into the desert. The movement, however, is likely to continue in the more inacessible and mountainous districts.

Note .—This seems an improbable destination though it may indicate further road construction up to the Chinese frontier, perhaps towards Irkistam. 17. Persian Refugees. —20 Persian Military refugees including 8 Persian conscripts in the Red army were sent to Askhabad at the beginning of October. Note. —These probably were mobilized in connection with the Soviet assistance to the re bellion in the Burjnurd district of Eastern Persia. 1 . Basmac 1 i. —These still operate in small parties in the mountains. 12 Mohammadan soldiers deserted and joined them during October. The en forcement of Conscription has also led to an increase in their numbers. III.—HERAT. 19. The Persian Military Attache from Kabul who arrived in Meshed ten days ago reported this province to be very quiet. It seems that Salar Jang Abdul Rahim has lost much of his independ ence and obeys the instructions of Kabul more readily than formerly. 20. Soviel Trade. —In Herat city Soviet trade is paramount. L.

Political Russian Refugees in Persia. The report of the Secretary of the Consulate- General at Meshed is of considerable interest and confirms the reasons for disquietude on this subject. The evidence from Persian sources seems to be specially important (on the assumption that it is more or less to be relied upon). In this connection please see Major Hamber T s comment at the end of the report. Many of the instances of ill-treatment are due to the corruption of frontier officials and police. The attitude of the Persian authorities themselves however, does not encourage the entry of destitute refugees, though the law of Persia contemplates that refugees should be afforded protection. The question of making provision for refugees who are really destitute is obviously a difficult one for the Persian authorities. Meshed report received via India. We now have a despatch from Tehran covering both this report and that from Tabriz (P.Z.7834/31). At the latter place the Consul considers that the Persian provincial authorities behave on the whole in a creditable manner; steps are taken to settle refugees in Azerbaijan but away from the Russian frontier. recommended in paragraph 5 of the Minister’s despatch, viz, to reinforce by action at Tehran a suggestion of The above was written on the copy of the It is submitted that we may concur in the Foreign Office proposal to approve the action tightertighter control which is already being made to the Governor General at Meshed. This seems to hold out the best prospect 6f helping towards alleviation of the plight of the refugees: what seems to be principally required is proper control over the frontier officials and police in IChrassan. It will be seen that the Persian authorities _do issue Nansen certificates to refugees who wish to leave Persia; but the trouble is that most of them are too destitute to do so.

Sir J. Simon proposes, subject to Secretary Sir S.

I have also asked the noting Vioe-Gonaul at r.esht for a report on this subject but I have thought it well to send you my comments on the two present reports without awaiting that of Hr# pavis. 2# It will be observed from the two reports enclosed that while Mr#Palmer considers that on the whole the Persian author1ties In Azerbaijan are behaving in a creditable m: nner towards these refugees. Colonel Barrett adduces opposing evidence rs regards Khor&amp;san where excessive discretion is allowed to subordinate officials of the Persian aoverament# 3# So far as it has been possible to ascertain here, the Persian Government are willing to allow bona fide political refugees from Russia to remain in Persia but ths frontier authorities have strict instructions to inquire thorou^ly into each individual ease with the result that fhe Right Honourable Sir John Simon etc#, £}#G# S#Z« , etc#, etc#, 9?he Foreign Office# abusesabuses unquestionably occur especially in Khorasan where there ia greater suspicion than elsewhere• 4. It is natural that the Persian Government should be afraid that political agitators, in the f piise of refugees should be introduced across the frontier and it may safely be assumed that the danger is a real one. So far as I oan judge it is inevitable that refugees from Russia should suffer considerable hardship but it might be mitigated if the Persian Government issued instructions that no action should be taken against them without previous reference to the Governor-General and the locnl General officer Commanding. 5 . I am satisfied that anything approaching a formal representauion to the Persian Government, which would probably become known to the Soviet jrabassy, would be more likely to prejudice than to advance the humanitarian object which we have at heart but I think that no harm will bo done, and possibly some good may ensue, if I suggest to the minister fo * foreign .affairs that decisions which may involve endless h rdship to innocent persons should only be taken by the highest local authority adding that reports which have reached me of the sufferings of refugees from Russia illustrate the force of this contention. 6 . I am sending a copy of this despatch to Kis Majesty’s Consul-General f t Hashed with a request, if he sees no objection, that he will find an opportunity of speaking in the same sense to the Governor General.

British Consulate Tahris Dept.29,1031 Refugees from Russia started to pour into Azerhaid^an in xlarch 1930 (although some had reached here in the last months of 1929) when revolts started in the different parte of the U.S.S.R.,especially in the Caucasus,and this owing to the enforcement of the Soviet 'FIVE YEARS’ ECOiiCKIC PLAN' and the formation of 'KOLKHOZES' (Colietctive Farms.). Ihece refugees arrived Aserhaidj^oi in 2 wayc:- (a)• By crossing the R.Araxes near Julfa or the 9ara-Dagh;and then coming to Tabriz. (h). By crossing the frontier near Ardabil. In both cases the Persian Police arrested them,kept them in pri son for a few days,just a matter of plain formality,for not having passports and then set them free. Most of the refugees who crossed to Ardabil cane on to Tabriz after being released. 2. This continued until tho beginning of the summer 1931,during which time more than 1500 refugees readied Azerbaidjan. During all this time the Soviets continually demanded the surrejv &gt; der of these refugees or their deportation from Azerbaijan as they | did not wan$ these people to stay near their frontier. The Persian Authorities,however,at first did not comply with the Russian demand. Of the above 1500 refugees 800-900 were Moslem Tartars from the Caucasus,400-500 Armenians from the Caucasus and from the interior of the U.S.S.R. and the rest (about 200 refugees) were White Russians and Jews. There also arrived here several Germans from Russia. The Tabriz German Consulate gave them passes and even paid their expenses to send them to Germany,via Iraq-Syria. Among the moslem Tartars there were many Musawatists,and the Tabriz Turkish Consulate General helped them. They gave them pass- ports to Turkey and 30 tomans each for expenses. About 30-4o tch | Tartar /Tartar refugees were helped by the Turkish Consulate General here in this way.. Later,when the refugees were deported; the Turks helped Boiae more of the a© Tartar huaawatiats. One part of tlie refugees left Tabriz in due course to other towns in Persia,another part received indentification documents of some kind here (Sijil etc.,)and settled down. About 600 were,however,left without any documents or protection at all. Towards the and of spring of this year (1931) the local Authori ties declared that any further refugees crossing the boundry to Per sia illegally, were to bo surrendered to the Sovietsjand this,of course i '’P®* or ^* rB lr oa Teheran. This declaration almost stopped the 'rusjf of refugees,but not oosg&gt;letely. - I ...i f.uoh surrondor was made,however,of such refugees as arrived here via me a.Araxss near fulfa or the Gara-Lagh. But it is repor- tod ' lu ' J i '' out 10 refugees •.&gt;re iumded over to the Soviets from Ar- dabil via Astara. Tliis new policy of the Persian Authorities was changed very soon, however,owing to the fact that the Russians failed to fulfill their own promises;and later no oases of such surrenders have been heard of. iiot very long after that,however,the question of a new Russo- i i-erslan Oommercial -gl-cemont was raised again,and suddenly towards the second half of July 1951 all the refugees who had not by then left Azerbuiojan or 'Ogulrod documents of some sort (aijil eto.)wwee or- 1 dered to get ready to leave., fio destination was mentioned at first. This was believed to be due to Russian pressure,and I have no doubt | that thie vma in fact the case. The real deportation began on the 27th of July. The Police roun ded up the refuggee in Tabriz town,searched their houses and after S gathering them into the Police Station sent them to a building near I -he Railroad station where thoy had to wait until deported under armed „ escort. As no destination had been mentioned aarv rumours began to circulate;and it was feared that they were going to be handed over to the Sovietse_ue next however* it wae announced that they were to 'be taken to the fculduz district of Azerhaid^an,near the Iraq frontier where they would be settled. Ihis was actually done. rhe Police thenExselves hired lorries and despatched the refugees in groups to bulduz via Maraglieh. First went ISO people consisting of ^ixmenianafituasians*Jews and a few Tartars. Later on the rest t remaining (RussiaiiStJewBfAmenians and all the Tartars) followed. The entire number of refugees deported differs according to various reportsj but it wae from 400 to 600. It has proved difficult to ascertain the number of the Tartars actually deported and the great majority of them very soon settled down in the villages of the Sulduz. Luring this deportation^ the Turkish Consulate General at Tabriz came forward and took several Uusawatist Tartars out of the hands of the police ;ana giving tnem passports and money for expenses (30 to** mans each) sent tnem to Turkey via Bashkaleh. As said above most of the Moslem Tartars,peasants for the most part,very soon settled down in the 3ulduz. Ho further details ar rived here aoout them. But the condition of the Christian refugees (Armeriian 6 ,Russians) and Jews who numbered about 120-130 in all was reported to oe oerriule. There were among them many educated men, specialists,boctorB,etc.etc.. and naturally they could not get along under ouch conditions. Bo they applied to the Iraq Authorities, through the Frontier guards,to get permission to enter Iraq. After some time about 40 Armenians succeeded in getting permission. The rest remained waiting in despair;until after 5 weeks some of them were allowed to return to Tabriz. During all the 5 weeks the ref ugees were not kept in one place but wandered about in the Sulduz dis trict,mostly on foot,and nearly always slept out of doors,under freq uent showers of rain and hail. There were among them about 10 la4- * no children wore deported and the refugees left their ehil— dren,if they had any,at i^briz in the care of some third party. t, wVery soon after the refugees returned to Tabriz (those who were allowed to do bo) they were told that they had to go to Kazvinv# Upon this they began to call on the British and French Consulates in order to see if they could get permission to immigrate to either Iraq.,byriafFrance,Palestine or any other place* Now almost all of thorn have received their Jawazs and will leave for Kazvin in 2/3 days^ Several of these refugees,however,as said above,continue to i remain in the Sulduz where conditions are bad and which will grow worse with the approach of the rainy season and the winter* But pre sumably those sent to Kazwin will not be so very badAoff in time* New Itefu&amp;eoa* Refugees continue to arrive from Russia again but not so many as previously,although the situation lias not changed in the U*S*B*R*,cind there is constant fighting and dis order, especially in the Caucasus* The newcomers now also use a third route:- via Turkey * They first cross into Turkey by the Bridge of MARKARA (or liakarl) and later to Persia* This route is mostly used by Moslem Tartars &amp; occasionally by some Artaeniana, reoommended to the Turks by their fellow Tartars, or in disguise as Moslems* None oi these refugees are allowed to stay hers,and they have either to go to the Bulduz or to Kazvin,Zinjan etc* Borne of them are said to have escaped the attentions of the Police and to be living in or around Tabriz in disguise* Rejections at the frontier * The Persians for a time insis- jj ted on refugees having passports f&gt;Avyk **» ■ * issued in Russia;and in fact many Persian refugees entered Persia possessed of Persian Passports issued by Persian Consuls in Russia* Refusals to be allowed to enter have been prompted by one of three reasons:- 1*. The person refused was suspected rightly or wrongly of being a Bolshevik Agent masquerading as a refugee* 2* The person had been convicted of or was wanted by the Russian Police for some Civil or Criminal offence* B*G* Evasion of the last instalment of Taxes due in Russia*3#, Tha peraon coiaplet^ly do&amp;tituto* iiut it should 'be uotod that tiki 2 *e is no similarity between the case oi* A* A person rejected at the frontier; and B* A person who iias crossed in a clandestine nunner and been handed back* In the case of B• the liussians would no doubt deal sucMaril# with hint while in the oase of A# there would seem no conceivable war- son for harsh treatment,unless the person had attempted to leave with out paying taxes and been discovered at the Frontier only by thf Aua- sian i«'rontier Guards. ihe giiief of Police has x»opeatodly assured me that the Proc lamation that refugees would be handed back was mainly intended to put a stop to clandestine immigration —which ultimately led to accus ations by the Russians of Persian connivance with the revolts still proceeding in various parts of the Caucasus,and generally ended in threats by the Russians that they would again send their troops into Azerbaidjan to round up themselves all refugees near the frontier. When it is recalled that the Russians on June 3rd 1930 ac tually did raid this Province from iOiudafirin,and carried out a 2 days sweeping operation in Persian territory,! personally consider that the Persians have behaved over this refugee ^uastion in u manner deserving i of commendation and not of blame. In this memorandum paragraphs 1 to 11 inclusive were pre pared for me by the Armenian Element of Tabriz,and I have not altered the gist of their report,but merely 'touched up' their English a little. The worst accusation which can be made against the Persian Authorities seems to me the one that- neglect of the comfort of the 10 ladies and othor educated Russian refugees was shown during their 6 stay in the Sulduz.. It shoul,however,in order to be equi*able,be recalled that these refugees themselves hoped to be admitted to Iraq^and from ay road reports it will be clear that there is aq accomodation along the Rawanduz route est of Nagadeh.iiad these refugees aoeepted Iramedlate transfer to Kasvln they would presumably not have undergone suoh hardships:whlle,as for appli cation for admission to Iraii,7 of these rejected families who leave for Kaavln to-day or to-morrow— have now filled in the usual Applicat ion Poms here for transmission to Bagdad by myself.

It is quite incorrect to say that the Per sian Authorities at Tabriz have not usdd the Hansen Passes., Several persons have travelled to Syria,France, Argentine etc. by these passes recently. it must be noted,however, that the.

(Information from ^tuasian sources). ******* ***** ** In August of 1929 practically all the Russian refugees living Meshed were sent to Tehran at the instance of Bolsheviks, The unexpectedness of this movement disturbed all, since they were forced hurriedly to close down their business dealings or workshop^ which were disposed of at a dead loss. No sort of protest was entertained. Even those Russians were sent who had become naturalized Persian subjects. In 1929 two refugees Lelekov and Shishko were sent from Tehran to Askhabad , and only thanks to a lucky chance meeting with the Amir-i-Lashkar they were released at Kuchan. At the beginning of the winter of 1929 four refugees arrived at the village of Koltar Chinar (Persian Terri tory) , their names are as follows Tashkent Jew Abraham Ravldov, Odessa Jew name not known, Moscow Jew Podolsk! and with them one T urkoman. In Koltar Chinar they stayed under restraint for some days, then suddenly at night a Soviet frontier guard detachment appeared in the village, called the re refugees out of their house and shot three of them dead and returned back across tho frontier, the forth Podolski pretending to be ill delayed coming out of the house and hid and in this manner saved himself. a These particulars were furnished by Podolski to the British Military Attache when he reached Meshed. It is obvious, they had been given away to the Soviet frontier post by the Persian frontier guard. In 1930 two refugees Bonks and Borisov crossed the frontier in the vicinity of Ohirvan. They had with them5. 6 . 7. them valual)!© property worth 10,000 tomans, (£ 1000 ). In Shervan the Chief of the Nazmieh (Police) took from them every thing they hah , gave written instructions to the Head of the local Aranieh,(Road guards) to hand them hack to the Soviet frontier O.P.U. post. Only thanks to quite unforseen circumstances, they, together with the Commander of Amnieh, reached Kuchan. Their case is now before the Tehran Military Court. After this two refugees also arrived in Chirvan, one former officer Toov and a soldier. They had with them 9 karakul skins, worth at the least estimate £ l/- each. Under the threat of being immediately sent back to the a.P.U. post they were forced to sell these skins to the Amnieh for 3h 4/- each. This paid their way as far as Kuchan, the rest of the journey they performed on the foot begging food on the way. At the end of 1930 eleven refugees were detained in the frontier post of Lutfabad for months. After this six of them were sent back across the frontier and one was handed over to the G-.P.U. post at Artik. The remaining five eventually succeeded in recross ing the Persian frontier at another point and eventually reached Meshed. Their names are as follows Nikolalev, Yurkov, Pabulyan and two Armenians, who were sentenced to penal servitude in Russia. In 1931 every refugee crossing the frontier was informed that he would be sent back to Russia and only after the most debasing prayers and several days impri sonment under the continual threat of return, were they permitted to enter further into Persia. Half way to Kuchan the refugees were tried and ordered to be sent to Afghanistan, the Persian authori ties knowing full well that the Afghan Covernment would not accept them. In this manner nine refugees were sent from Kuchan e 7Kuchan to the Afghan frontier, travelling on foot 400 versts. They eventually returned to Meshed sick and worn out the Afghans having refused to accept them on any pretext. Two brothers Akseev, a Georgian Manga Sharvim, and a woman Denisova having reached Meshed after several days in prieon, were handed over to the Amnieh (Hoad guards) for despatch to Afghanistan hy stages. Tttien they ordered them to proceed they lay on the ground and absolutely refused to move, notwithstanding beating and torturing they managed to get in touch with other Hussians in the town. The case v;as immediately represented to the Gover nor General and after a great deal of trouble and argu ment they were finally permitted to remain in Meshed. At the same time a refugee sometime resident in Meshed Galkin was sent to Afghanistan and returned in rags and bare foot after two months on the road. A refugee Mazur who arrived in the autumn of 1930 remained under arrest for 41 months. Although ordered to release him several times, the Head of the Nazmieh refused to do so, stating that his documents had not yet been received from the frontier post where they had been taken from him. As a protest against this treatment Mazur went on a hunger strike. After five days of this and as result of his long term of imprisonment on bread and water he died in hospital. The Bolsheviks demanded that he should not be buried in the Hussian cemetary, but owing to the repre sentation of the white Hussians and the absence of any other burial ground he was accorded a Christian burial.ii &lt;to 11. In the suimer of 19 31 a party of a'bout 50 Molokans (ARasaian religioue sect) crossed the frontier near Kelat-i-Nafliri. The Conraander of the Persian frontier post demanded the 16 year old daughter of one of the Molokans 'by the name of Balova, otherwise he would not &gt; give permission for the refugees to proceed any further* d This request 'being refused the refugees were detains under arrest for months, and only after their case had 'been represented hy Molokans resident in Meshed to the Governor Genera 1, they were finally released and permitted to proceed to Meshed. 12. At the present time (October 1931) a Molokar to gether vrith his family consisting of 2 sons and 2 daughters aged 13 and•15 respectively have been in * rrison at Burjnurd more than a month owing to the refusal of the parents to hand over their daughters to the local frintier official. They have been informed that they will be released as soon as the girls are handed over. 13. The Mulla of the Osetins, (Russian Musultnan Con- muni ty) who had lived already ten months in Meshed requested the Nazmieh for permission to be permitted to proceed to Tehran. He was arrested and ordered to be sent back to Russia, only with great difficulty this was avoided through the interference of the Turkish Consulate (He was a Caucasian Turk) and he was liberated and permitted to proceed to Turkey. 14. Tikhonov a Molokan resident ten years in Meshed and who owns considerable property, and is w^'ll known as generous man ivho assists needy refugees has been ordered to leave Meshed forthwith for Tehran. The reason is obviously that the local Coviet authorities have influenced the authorities gainst him on account of his benificient.activities.15. In September 1931 three Turkomen were arrested by the Serakhs frontier posts and by the order of Garrison Commander handed over to the Soviet frontier post opposite. This affair was witnessed by a Turkoman refugee 'Rajab Kuli at present in Meshed. 16. The majority of these incidents are performed by the frontier officials or the lower grades of the administrative or police services. Their action which is illegal is never punished since it is well known that there is no one to protect the interests of the ■Russian refugees. quite a number of cases however are definitely done by o^er of or with the connivance of the higher \ administration.

Evidence froa Persian sources * According to the law of Persia refugees from cut side countries should be afforded protection. TIioBe who arrive without passports from any neighbouring country are sent for trial before the Adlieh Department (Department of Justice). The court fixes some days of imprisonment as a punish ment in such cases after which the individual is released and instructed that either 1. He can return to the country from whence he ran away through any Persian frontier post he cares to name, or 2. Hs must go to some place appointed by the local authorities well in the interior of the country remote from any frontier. lliose refugees which possess professional qualifications which may be useful to the Persian Government are occasionally given employment as engineers* road constructors* irrigation specialists etc. If the Persian authorities entertain any suspicions about the refugee he is repatriated to the country from whence he came. It is stated that the Persian Government has not so far handed back any refugees direct to the Soviet authorities. * Note. No means of reaching the interior are provided# this would involve walking any thing up to 400 miles through waterless desert in most instances. Should the unfortunate refugee reach any such place such as for instance Yezd or Tabas he would find it absolutely impossible to find employment of any sort. There being no European inhabitants at all. £ This most certainly not the case, vide other evidence# even from Persian sources. The following figures refer to the province of Khorasan and were supplied by the Chief of Police in Meshed. They may be taken as official and fairly accurate. Khorasan covering the greater part of the Persian Soviet frontier, with the exception of the Caucasus may *)e taken as giving a fair indication of the number of refugees entering Persia/^ from otherother directions louring the period June to Peceraber 1930 the following uuiaber of Luro^eaii Eubsia/i refugees entered in Khorftean and ware registered by the local polices- iin taxed •• •••••••••••»•• 280 Luspec ted oy tlic Persian Government and repatriated to Russia ♦.,...••179 Remaining •••••••••.•••• 101 Of these remaining in Khorasan. • • • • • 19 Period January to October 1931, Entered Khorasan European Russians, . . • , • 130 Sent back,90, .Remaining 33. * In Khorasan.••••.11, Turkomans •••,••• 630 * Molokan &amp; Caucasians • , • • 200 # Note. This is certainly an under estimate. From intelligence sources I know that several thousand Turkoman* entered during this period. They entered the wild districts round Bujnurd and Sarakhs and are naturally difficult to account for. X should estimate the figure at possibly Turkomans 4000 and Molokan and Turks (Caucasians) 500. European Russians are generally suspected by the Nazmieh (Police) since there have been a certain number of instances of Cr.P.U. agents entering Persia in the guise of refugees and propagandists and secret service workers. The reasons given by the Persian Government for sending back the greater portion of the refugees is that they either refuse to Jat live in the interior where they had been appointed or to return voluntarily to Russia through a Persian frontier post. The discovery of some G.P.U.agents amongst the refugees was reported to Tehran. Through the instance of the Soviet Embassy these were sent back to Russia and not punished by the Persian authorities and at the same time secret orders were issued by the Persians (obviously at Soviet instigation) that all refugees snould in future be repatriated to Russia . 'ihis policy has been carried out more or less steadily&amp;e the tigurec of repatrtr tione show, particularly in recent months. Turkomans and Holokans are usually permitted to settle in 'Me wilder parts of Persia since they possess flocks of sheep and ^oats fchich they frequently bring *ith them. There are also considerable number of Turkomans resident in Persia 'who are Persian subjects. comaKT Iwo definite instances during the last year have occurred of Cojumuiij.st agents acting in the guise of refugees having givtrj tiie x'ersian authorities in Khoraean cause to take action against them. In both these cases the offenders, in one case seven and in the other case six men, were repatriated to Russia. *here, o course they found / immediate refuge. These instances were followed by intensified repatriation of other refugees entirely innocent of any political activity. ihe defini te po3.icy of the Soviet, whose influence in Tehran and northern Persia is extremely great, is to bring all refugees trom the Soviet Union into bad repute with the Persian Government, and in this manner cause them to be repatriated by the ; ersiac authorities, and in general to make the condition Ox . efugees in Persia as difficult as possible in order to discourage migration across the frontier, x&gt;oal authorities in Persia in cases of perplexity or trouble always 'hand on the baby' as quickly as possible. Tfce typical examples in this report might be instanced in the send ing of refugees to the Afghan frontier, or to Central Persia, or quicker still back to Soviet Russia, Ho money can be made out of a refugee, therefore from Persian viewpoint the sooner he is pushed on somewhere else the better. Toe disdemeanour of the frontier officials and the police subordinatessubordinates are, unfortunately too Twell confirised 'by unrefuteable evidence to Ice disregarded. Hiere is a considerable and yrofitable trade in hunan beings carried out by Persians aiid ILurds living near Use fron tic&gt;r - no kidnap refugees 'wantsd* oy Ute G• l J • U• and carry tkem back across toe frontier and bund toem over. If required I can produce a considerable amount of guaranteed evidence on tois point.

The Turkomen trouble still continues but the Bdlshevics have the upper hand, end the number of refugees crossing into Persia shows no signs of diminution* These refugees are now a serioud problem xor the Persians as many ere armed, and thr is a suspicion that many of them are Russian Agents seeking to stir up trouble in Persia.

While recognising that the matter is primarily one for the Persian Govt., Sir Samuel Hoare suggests that it might perhaps be possible to do something towards preventing indiscriminate deportation^ by bringing the question to the notice of the Persian authorities, either locally or at Tehran. It may perhaps be presumed that the Persian Govt., if they are approached in a suitable manner, would be willing to do what ii possible to avoid playing into the hands of the Soviet authorities in this matter, by sifting the genuine refugees from Soviet agents who may seek to obtain surreptitious entry into Persia. Sir Samuel Hoare would suggest, for Lord Reading’s consideration, tha'i the possibility of taking some action on these or other lines, as well as t)ie actual facts of the situation, might be investigated.

Olive reported that the Minister of Court hed stated, in conversation with him that the number of Russian refugees entering Persia was becoming a serious problem. He had added that there was no question of returning them to Russia, where they would certainly be shot, and that the Persian authorities were therefore bound to give them such facilities as were possible to enable them to settle down in Persia# 4. In paragraph 2 of eshed Intelli ence Summary No.13 of April 1930, the Military , ttache recorded a statement by the Governor General of Khorasan to the effect that the Persian Government had hitherto refrained from deporting Russian refugees entering Pe sia without passports, but that they might ultimately be compelled to resort to deportation. 5. It appears, in fact, that the Persian authorities in Khorasan may recently have resorted to deportation, since paragraph 5 of Meshed Intelligence Nummary No.9 of May 1931 refers to a report that eleven Russians who had escaped into Persia, and who had been brought to Meshed, had been returned to the C• a# S.

According to «y information a number of Russians are constantly drifting into Northern Persia without Soviet passports. The Persians repatriate them. This means that they almost certainly ere shot when they get back to Russia. Whilst I know the complicated technical difficulties, I still wonder whether League of Hatiens passports might not be issued to at least some of these refugees. I am aware that the Persian Ghargd d’Affaires in London said in the Times last Saturday that there ia nothing in these complaints.

The so-called Han: en CertifiCf 5 te 8 are presumably the sort of documents you have in iaind. They are in effect a kind of League of nations passport, and are intended for Armenian and Russian refugees. Unfortunately, however, these certificates can only be issued by the Government of the country whore the refugees happen to be, end the Persian Government havo not accepted the arrangement by which they ore issued. It is, of course, no direct concern of His Majesty f s Government that the Persian Government, possibly fearing friction with the Soviet Government, have never acceded to the Nansen Agreement, am I am sure that in present circumstimee£; it would be worse than useless for His Majesty's Government to suggest to the Persian Government that they should secede to this Agreement vnd issue Hansen certificates to refugees from Russia. I fear therefore that there is nothing that either we or the League of Nations can do in the matter.

They are not numerous and are mostly farmers from South Russia. The majority of them are repatriated to Russia immediately they cross the frontier, and in such cases they meet with immediate death or imprisonment, which, under present con ditions in my country, is still worse. Up to the end of last year the Government of his Majesty the Shah steadfastly declined all demands made bv the Soviet authorities for the forcible repatriation of these political refugees—humble peasants with wives and children. According to information I have • received, this laudable effort of the Persian Government has been supported by the friendly cooperAtion of the British Legation in Teheran. Thanks to this support, the Persian Government could withstand the Soviet pressure. In the course of the last few months, however, the Soviet demands to Persia in this connexion have become acute. Her northern provinces have to face the possibility of some kind of unpleasant interference by the Soviet military authorities should the Persian Government insist on according such protec tion as has always been universally granted to political refugee's. During the past month 45 refugees have, been forcibly sent back to the territory of U.S.S.R. According to latest in formation received, the same fate is reserved for a group of Russian farmers who crossed into the north-eastern provinces of Persia a few weeks ago. Can one remain unmoved by this state of affairs in a country which is a member of the League of Nations ? Can nothing be done by the British Government, who would thus still Uphold the best traditions of the Pax Britannica in the East? Can some kind of support be accorded to the Government of the Shah, and so prevent the extradition of the unfortunate refugees to the mercy of then- most inhuman and bitter enemies? Will the representatives of Great Britain at Geneva raise this'question of elementary humanity at the earliest opportunity, and see that the League of Nations gives to it sympathetic consideration ?

The papers also give indication of the various different ethnic groups and peoples comprising the refugees from Russia (including Turcoman [Turkmen], Armenian, Khirgis [Kyrgyz], Bukharan Jewish), and differences in the treatment and movements of these different groups, including, for example, Bukharan Jewish refugees’ attempts to obtain visas for travel to Palestine.The file contains a single item of correspondence in French, being a copy of a letter from the Secretary General of the League of Nations (f 9).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Vice-Consul</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Tabriz</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Resht</geographic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul General, Meshed</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Tabriz</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Russia</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Meshed</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Reports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Diaries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Famines</topic></subject><subject><topic>Refugees</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0003d4#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
