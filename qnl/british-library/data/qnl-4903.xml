For the three years previous to the war the average annual Import of tin was 101 cases.of sheet approximate tim. 30 x 18 x9 inches were the/dimensions of each case. Owing to shipping from India being restricted there were no importations in 1915 and 1916 with the exception of small quantities which individuals brought in their personal possession and which the Customs did not /register.

(in the Jibnoncn of '..Vp Political Resident).Tel3gran Frorai- Trevor, Bushire, To:- Foroign., Hinla. No. 1261. Dated the Iflth July, 1917. Early in the year it was found tlmt Peraians up country were buying up British sovereigns and Turkish Liras round, the Gulf and causing thera to be taken inland fron Bushire. As at that tine there seeded sone chance that the gold was destined for the eneny I got the Governor to stop the deopatch of gold up country as far as possible. Recently Consul Kirman reported that Persians frora India were inporting sovereigns in snail quantities. He adds that considerable quantities of sovereigns are being put on the market at Kirmn, possibly the renains of the Gerrans* funds. Consul add^s he does not fmppose t^ie Governnent of India would like hiri to try and buy in this English gold and renit it to India or hold it for a rise in local value of sovereign which until recently stood at 55 :rans. Kow Vice-Consul Lingeh reports sovereigns are being imported there and sent up country. I think inport now is probably speculative or for hoarding purposes and unobjectionable fron military point of view. But I understand Governnent of India are now anxious to get gold, so I have subnitted above infomation with a view to the issue of instructions as to whether Political Officsrs should endeavour to check the flow of gold up country, and to divert it back to India; if so by what raeans?Tele .nran R &lt; | F'rora:- Trovor, Bushire, loz- Poroign, Sinla. i 'O m 3.'t 0^ « Datad the 16th August, 1917. My telegraa of 16th July 1^51• Oonnidorable quan tities of sovereigns have been coning into Bushire lately; Vice-Consul estirmtes about £ J30,000 in the last nonth, while Collector of Custons, liasra, eati^iates that 6,000 pounds, find their way weekly to Bushire fron that port and 1 an informed by Political lasra that sone £ 20,000 went to Isfahan by Lynch road recently* Traffic is chiefly in hands of Jew Speculators who nake profit of 3 or 4 Krans per sovereign by selling to purchasers acting on behalf of principals up country, who wish to hoard for a rise in valu^, or who desire to keep their savings in sovereigns as being portable, or who wish to nelt then dovm for ornarents. In any case the sovereigns are lost to circulation. KaVe consulted Basra and an informed that so far as that adninistration is concerned there is no objection to export of gold from Basra or shipnent to Persia being pro- hibited should the iovernnent consider it expedient. It seens desirable that export of sovereigns from India should only be to Fesopotarsia for Governnent purposes . and that local officers should bo authorised to restrict ^ke their diversion to ^ersia as far as possible.From- The Secretary to the CTOvernnent of India in the Foreign and Political Departnent, To:- Lieutenant Colonel A.P.Trevor, Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Buahire. Mer.oranduw No. 842-W. Dated Sinla, the 14th Septenber, 101^. Your tele grans, Nos. 1^51 and 140^5, dated the l^th July and Iflth August 1917 respectively, regarding the inport of sovereigns into Persia. n. Enquiries rnade have failed to reveal any abnorrml export frora India and it does not seen probable that the procedure suggested by His Britannic I&amp;jesty's Consul, Kirrmn, would result in the acquisition of a sufficiently large number of sovereigns to justify its adoption. Further the Government of India consider that should the export of sovereigns frosi India show a tendency to rise, restrictive Measures, if any, should bo applied at this end rather than at the ports of Persia. . The Government of India, however, see no objection to Political officers in the occupied territories being aui lorised to use their discretion in checking unobtrusively the diversion of sovereigns to Persia as far as possible •itaer by restricting their issue, where there are no political or Military objections to this course, or otherwise. 3d.
