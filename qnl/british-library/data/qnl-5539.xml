The Foreign Office originally wrote to us last August asking what allowances would he payable to Mr. Cethin under the Government of India Regulations. In our reply, we told them that as acting incumbent he would receive the allowances attached to the post during the period for which he was acting; and added that no objection was seen to him receiving-an allowance at the government of India rate or at the Foreign Office rate, whichever they saw fit. The Foreign Office wrote again on 11th December saying that they agreed that Mr. Getliin should receive the Government of India allowances, and would we arrange for him to be paid £69:18:0). As he is normally paid b ' the Foreign Office, and the amount is divisible between and the Government of India in any case, it would apx&gt;ear to be far more suitable for him to be paid by them in this instance.

The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W.l. 0 f 4 JAN 1945 V ■&amp;, c J, Sir, I am directed hy the Secretary of State for India to refer to Foreign Office letter No. K.13802/2083/234 of 16th December last, , regarding the payment of allowances to Mr. J. F. Gethin while acting as Consul Creneral, Ahwaz* Mr. Arnery would suggest that as Mr. Gethin is a meiriber of the Ooiisulut^ Service and not of the Indian Political Service, and since Ms other emoluments are paid through the Foreign Office, a more convenient arrangement than that suggested in the Foreign Office letter under reference would 'be for the representation allowance to 'be paid by the Foreign Office in the first instance, together with his other emoluments. The amount would then be classed as diplomatic and Consular expenditure and would/Accountant General Please see papers flagged , X* on attached file and notes inmediately below. Mr. Gethin, Vice-Consul at Ahwaz, is a Foreign Office man holding a post which is normally on the Indian Political Service cadre. From 31st March to 12th May last, during the absence of the Consul General an$ Indian Political Service man, though the appointment is a Foreign Office one, he acted as Consul General. In August last the Foreign Office asked us what allowances would be payable to him under the Government of India regulations (Ext.3762/2+4). * n our reply we stated that no objection was seen to Mr. Gethin being paid at which ever rate the Foreign Office saw fit. The amount is classed as p-iplomatic*Consular expenditure and is divisible between Imperial and Indian revenues. The Foreign Office wrote to us again on December l6th saying that they agreed that he should be paid at Government of India rates, and asking that arrangements should be made for the Government of India to pay him in the first instance. We queried this orally as the Foreign Office normally pay his salary into his account in this country. However, it appears that their Accounts Department are unable to pay the representation allowance^ in this case as they have not got Treasury sanction for the increased rate. We should be grateful for your views on whether the •S®verw*ent of India should be asked to pay or whether we sMbiild write to the Foreign Office officially and suggest should somehow arrange for payment into Mr.Gethin*s MriGethin is now acting again as Consul General and presumably the decision taken in this instance will form a precedent for future payments to him. it Jthemselves.In any further communication ' i jL^ r ■ on this subject, please quote ^a, No. 1380^/2083/^54.

T.A. hq )j / This matter has been delayed while endeavours were made to trace the precedent of Captain Ryan quoted by the Foreign Office. It now appears that the question of Captain Ryan’s representation allowance was settled between the Foreign Office and the Treasury without reference to this Office or to the Government of India. I understand that if this were wholly a Government of India post, the acting incumbent would be paid the allowances to the post as suggested in the first paragraph of Teheran despatch No. 284. In the case of Mr. Gethin it would amount to Rs. 973 l (J7ai?»^(i^.i ? . 0 If he were paid a representation allowance of &lt;£250 as suggested in paragraph 2 of the Foreign Office letter, he would receive £51:5:0 - the Government of India share would be £5^5 ‘SI and respectively. * A further delay was incurred while the Foreign Office endeavoured to make up their minds which of these alternatives they preferred.

Secretary of State for India, a copy of a despatch which has been received from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Tehran concerning the allowances of Mr. J.P. G-ethin, Mis Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Ahwaz, when he was Acting British Consul-General there, from 31st March to 12th May, 1944. 2. Under Foreign Office regulations Mr. Gethin would receive representation allowance of £250 a year if the substantive officer were absent on leave or acting allowance of £225 a year if he were absent on public service outside his district- and I am to enquire what allowances if any are payable to him under India Office regulations for the period 31st March to 12th May. 2. In this connexion I am to add that when Captain Ryan acted in 1926 and 1927 he was paid representation allowance of £250. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, The Under-Secretary of State, India Office.The Acting Consul-General at Abwaz has raised the question whether Mr. Vice Consul Gethin should, for the period (31st March, 1944 - 12th May, 1944) when he himself was acting as Consul-Ceneral, draw the Government of India allowances of the post, including the conveyance allowance of Rs.lOO/- enjoyed by Consuls General paM by the Government of India. 2. In 1927 when Captain C.C.L. Ryan of the Indian political Service was in charge of the post In the absence of Mr. Monypenny It was decided that the Foreign Office should pay him a representation allowance, and I have the honour to refer In this connexion to tho correspondence ending with Sir Austen Chamberlain’s despatch No.277 (K3764/7181/234) of the 1st July, 1927. 3. I should be grateful for &amp; ruling as to whether a similar principle applies on occasions such as this, when a Foreign Service Officer has boon acting for a Consul-General who is In the service of the Government of India* If a similar principle* loss apply Mr. Gethin will no doubt draw acting allowances from the Government of India. Otherwise I presume ho will draw them from the Foreign Office and in that case I should be grateful If I might be Informed of the amount to which ho will be entitled. — * 4.
