It explains that the Resident did not expect him to destroy his work, but merely to delay them pending instructions from the Bombay Government. It further explains that if the British have no right to refuse permission to Arab chiefs seeking to build fortifications on the coast, then it places the British in a difficult position with respect to preventing the re-emergence of piratical activity in the Persian Gulf.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054362.0x000039#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
