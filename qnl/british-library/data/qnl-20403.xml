Very strict orders are already in existence re rebels mixing with Kuwait tribes and Shaikh assured me tonight his orders are being aarried out regarding Aviation telegram referred to. I think there Is mistake somewhere, for my information is that vanguard of rebels pa.ssed TTmm Runs this morning and would prob- -ably reach frontier this evening, and that the rest were following in dense column stretching as far back as A1 Atraf. This confirmed by Stewart this after- -noon and Ibn Saud informed this evening. That the latter considers situation satisfactory is shown by letter to me dated yesterday in which he praises splendid work of R.A.F. officers. This repeated to Baghdad in my telegram No. 90. Stories of illtreatment of rebel leaders I attribute to anti, Ibn Sfend propaganda: contrary reports by eyewitnesses just as common.

When Dawish and Ibn Hithlain surrendered to Chief Stax ^ l ficer, it would have been far better if the latter had -then asked for Faisal's submission too,as he did in the case of Ibn lami's whom I produced for him. j-'or nim suddenly to decidemand a vreek after the above ~ a I Shiblan should be placed 'under lock andand key also, is not only illogical, but difficult of explana tion and acoomp 1 isEfciment. -Tlie inan came into Kuwait after most of la is people and camels had been taken near Liana qui sh by Bin Sa'ud^to try and collect funds from some of his connections to . ^ set himself up again with camels etc #&gt; and buy clotlieso Possib the Chief Staff Officer has objected to his doing this, but he has not told me K&amp;t nor can I get anything out of him as to his reasons, beyond the fact that his decision is irrevocable, n I 'ha^e decided on the man r s arrest and therefore because I have 'decided, I shall most certainly carry it out' is all I can get out of him.

During the past week I have received three to four letters daily from Ibn Saud complaining tha.t the R.A.F. had allowed certain rebels to escape to Kuwait and Iraq and urging me to search the Kuwait tribes as several hide with them. Yesterday Hafiz Wahba handed me list of persons supposed to be hiding in Kuwait territory, also another letter from Ibn Saud urging me to redouble my efforts to find them, and hint- -ing that if deserters not handed over he might be obliged to postpone meeting with King. List contained names of seventeen so called rebel leaders, all of whom, with the exception of Khalid A1 Mohammed and Nasir A1 Jumaa, are either of very minor importance or entirely unknown. The Shaikh has assured me that he is making every effort to find the individuals but requires time. The trouble is that the Kuwait hinterlana is very easy to hide in and it is impossible to say yet if the fugitives have crossed into Iraq or Neid. T cannot but think tha Ibn Saud by his very unreasonable demand for a few entirely unimportant individuals is working up for an excuse to evade payment of the £. 10,000/- promised or possibly he intends getting out of meeting Faisal 1 .

As regards your Majesty's second complaint, though it is possible for individual camels to be sold secretly to Kuwait subjects, as suggested, I feel confident nothing on a scale to justify any anxiety on your Majesty's part is talcing place, for the gates are most carefully guarded at the present ime, and His Excellency Sheikh Ahmed has proclaimed publicly that anyone purchasing a camel bearing your Majesty's brand or that of any Nejd persons, will have his camel confiscated by him and re turned to your Majesty. I myself go daily to the Safah and every other day to Jaharah, and I can state positively that I Jiave seen no camels sold by your rebel subjects in the Town, nor have I seen anyboing brougxit in along tib.e Jaliarali road.

Government feel considera'ble appre- -bension as to the effect on Ihn Saud of the line referred to in your telegram No. 104 of 12th February regarding the disposal of Ihn Mashur. Importance of meeting 'between •Ihn Saud and Faisal in a friendly atmos\phere is so great alike from point of view of future relations between Iraq, and Nejd and from that of H.M's. Government themselves, and the refusal of Ihn Saud to persevere with meeting owing to dispute over this relatively small matter would he so unfortunate that they regard it as desirable to make all possible efforts to reach an understanding with him. From a different standpoint they would be placed in a most embarrassing position vis a vis Ibn Saud if the Iraq. Gov- I -ernment persist in their present uncompromising attitude. While it is perhaps arguable that the case of Ibn Mashur is not expressly covered by the terms of pledges given by the Iraq Government, H.M's. Government feel that it would be most difficult to contend that the guarantees given by them in November as to the expulsion of the 'contending forces' and 'concerting of necessary military measures' for that end do not apply to his case. ♦ ILM's. Government 1 s own inclination would 'be to hand over Itm. Mashur subjeot to the same guarantees as were obtained in the case of the other rehel leaders. They have no objection however to the Iraq. Government endeavouring to use Ihn Mashur as a 'bargaining counter tor securing satisfactory settlement of Dhaffir and Dahamshah. NeverthelessNevertheless it should he realised that the Iraq. Government have no claim under Art. 4 of the Bahra Agreement to the expulsion of the Shaikhs of these trihes. On the other hand, the demand for the Ilizyad surrender of Ihn Ms:dbot is, in their opinion, wholly un- -justifiahle as 'being directly contrary to Art. I of the Bahra Agreement, which expressly provides that punishment for raiding should he administered hy the Government to which the raiders are subjects. It does not provide for the handing over hy the Nejd Government to Ira^ of Nejdi offenders which, other considerations apart, would he likely to lead to embarrassing counter claims from Nejd. In the circumstances you should inform the while Iraq. Government that/H.M # s. Government are prepared to support the Iraq. Government in endeavouring to obtain satisfactory settlement as regards the Dhafir and Dahamshah Shaikhs, although not necessarily as a condition to the handing over of Ihn Mashur, they are definitely unahle to support the demand for the surrender of Ihn Mizyad and you should use your utmost endeavours to induce the Iraq. Gov- -ment to substitute a demand that Ihn Saud should inflict 'severe punishment H upon him and his followers, which v/ould he in accordance Mth Art. I of the Bahra Agreement. If nevertheless the Iraq. Government persist in maintaining a wholly uncompromising attitude as regards Ihn Mizyad and thus jeopardise the prospects of a satis- •factory settlement with Ihn Saud, H.M's.

In the conversation which I had with him on the 21st instant when he brought the matter up he stated that the King felt somewhat aggrieved at the prolonged delay in the settlement by His Majesty^ (rovernment of various questions of importance to him, I asked him for specific instances and he stated first of all that several points in the King's memorandum enclosed in my despatch Ho. 255 of September 30th had not been answered. On my pressing for further details he referred to the charges against Iraq and Koweit. I replied that it was quite impossible to reply at once to charges of such a nature and that they would require careful investigation involving by the nature of things considerable time in order to arrive at the truth. He then quoted the cases which I reported in my telegram and I promised to bring them to your notice.

A few men only were known to hare run away, 4. Sheikh 1 Abdullah st ted that his method of searching the countryside was done by dividing Kuwait territory into three portions, and searching each portion by means of the Sheikh*3 armed Fords, each accompanied by two of Bin Sa'ud's men, whose job was to verify all doubtful tents. In this way not a single tent throughout the 100 x 100 miles of Iluwait area escaped a visit and Bxanaiiation* 5. ITo refugees at all were found South Hast of the line -luwait- i-anaquioh, ' ' ' «.

This as far as is laiown was the only oase of viol ence done. 7. As refugees were found they were ordered to move slowly .~outh and concentrate at Uium Russ. The concentration was con ce pleted by the evening cf tin 19th February where in the ^resen of Iheikh r Abdullah al-Jabir, IZLian .3alieb Gheikh I'arhan (sent to watch matters on my behalf} Bar jas al Othman and r Abdullah al-lTafisi *s son, all cam els bearing' Bin ca r ud r s, Ibn Jiloui r s, and other well known Jejd bra: ds were suiniarily taken away frani the Refugees.

Finally the refugees were told they could 30 off into ITejd tn their own tine, and v/henever they chose, or if they preferred it, they could remain in ICuwait territory. According to reports of hhan Sahib Sheikh 7arhan and Bar jas bin Othman submitted to me in person last niplit (EOth February ' 1930), it is. robable that half of the refugees will quietly cross the frontier and the ot-.er naif ro. iain in Iluwait • Bstrjaa. was particular to say that Bin Sa'ud put great store on the re covery of stolen canals and that having got these, he really did not mind what happened to the rank and file all of w'-on were ve: poor, «nd of no importaxioe whatsoever v.-.itO* Barjas bin 0tinman and Ilarnud bin Llolioraed ■ anotlier of the Mix, sailed witti Ton L+ommBx this morning by motor D2;ow to : eat -.lis Majesty Hin^ jjin ^a.^ud on tlie liigli seas and' make their report, 11 &gt; - underSu :,d t'..at Bin 3a T ud wlio was I:ept JTully inTormed of tno progress of the sear oil up to tiie day he left Jarryaii, lias e^cpressed vary great pleasure^ and satisfaction at tlie ■ thorougli ..-is iccelienay jliel.Ji Aiuned lias liad tiie searcli car ried through. 1^*. t^ie search generally and move _south of the'refugees | to umm Russ was carried out- as hindly and in as hui^iane a ^ashion as possible, 1 am satisfied.

Sealed tonad U Jahir 11 Sahahi POLITICAL AGENCY. /^ @ Jill you please refer to your Demi-Official No. 14-S., dated 11th January, which reached me on 1st. February. I have not replied earlier as I thought it better to leave this as well as other matters till after Ramadhan, which is taken rather seriously in Kuwait by everyone. I have now discussed the Air Officer Commanding*s letter to you with the Sheikh vrho received the suggestion very favourably, and assured me he was himself only too anxious to eventually in crease the number of his armed Fords to 12, with S cars fitted with Wireless Sets. He was also favourably impressed with the idea of having an European Officer or superior N.G .O., to train and command the personnel for a year or so. The Sheikh however, assured me that money was his difficulty and that it would be quite impossible for him to raise the wherewithal at present % either to purchase the extra cars, Lewis Ouns or wireless sets, or pay an Englishman to take charge, but in course of time he hoped to do the needful. Money is of course the difficulty and in the present state of Kuwait's finances, I see no hope of the Sheikh doing anything in the lines suggested for at least a couple of years, or till trade improves. For the moment I think it were best to let the matter lie, and from time to time I could bring up the matter. Personally I am rather inclined to think the Sheikh is worse off_than he cares to admit. Sometime back for instance he told ble Lt. Colonel Y.Biscoe, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire./«r7@&gt; POLITICAL AGENCY, KOWEiT. me that his date gardens at ITAO Yieve bringing in greatly reduced revenues and that whereas in Mubarak* s time the annual date crop averaged 200,000 Maunds (Indian), the crop for 1929 was only 40,960 Maunds, He added that the reducing process had been most marked from 1924 and onwards. Again recently he mentioned quite casually that his receipts did not balance his expenditure, and that each year now he had to find the extra money out of his privy purse. As you doubtless are aware the State of Kuwait is quite primitive still, and is run on regular Bedouin lines; the main principle being that taxation should be as light as possible and the Customs receipts the chief form of revenue. This latter goes to the Sheikh, who divided it up among the members of his family according to fixed salaries - the balance going to pay for upkeep of his defence force, salaries of staff, etc., etc, I have just finished with the two days of r Id 'calling' and such a relief it is. Apart from the Ruler I have had to make over 30 calls. These have included calls on the Hutasarrif Basrah and staff and the Persian Consul, Basrah, who have been down for a holiday in an unofficial capacity.31/14 . eifeo 61/22, Telegram From, To Eepeated P.

Sir, . ^ In continuation of my despatcii No. 155 dated the 81st February 1930, and with reference to my telegram No» 190 of 24th March 1930, I have the honour to submit report on the activities of Mohammed, ibn Sultan one of H,M.King ibn Saud's Commanders on the Southern borders of Kuwait, as well as in Kuwait itself. 2 * The fact that this individual has been permitted to make one more, and I hope final examination of the camel herds of H.E. the Shaikh of Kuwait, and his tribesmen, should, I think, be of assistance in pressing H,M,King ibn Saud to carry out his undent iking to pay H.M,Government the £ 10,000/- promised at the Khabari Watha Conference, as by this latest search, the ground has been entirely out from under the King's feet and he cannot put forward the plea as an excuse for nonpayment that rebel camels are still being harboured in Kuwait. 3© On the 22nd of February last H.S. the Shaikh informed me that there was a rumour about that a detachment of ibn Saud f s troops 200 strong under one * Mohammed ibn Sultan was about to move up into Kuwait from the south and forcebly examine the camel heards of the 'Araibdar' and Kuwait 'Fldawiyeh' who were camped to the H,W,W, of Jahrah, A reconnaissance to Subaihiyeh on the same date resulted in ibn SmixtoEiH Sultan being located m the southern end of the Shagq. Neither he not hisdetachmeat had crossed the frontier. On the 23rd, following on a report that ibn oultan was repidly moving up the Shaqq and was making direct for the Kuwait tribal camps situate at its norther end , I at the personal request of the Shaikh and accompa nied by one of his officials reconnoitered the Sha^t from Manaqish on the Southern border to Quhaililla 25 miles N.W. of Jahrah. No trace of ibn Sultant detachment was found, though the news of his presence further South had spread like wild fire, and shepherds and woodcutters were every where found moving North, and out of harms way. Among the Kuwait tribes I found^a state of nervousness prevailed and preparations for resisting a raid were entrain. It may here be noted that the presence of a Nejd regular detach ment (Sarria) near the Kuwait frontier has in the past nearly always foreshadowed a raid and carrying off of camels, so the general feeling of neivousness found by me, was not to be wondered at, 5 ' 0n the evening of the 26th February the Shaikh again called on me, and reported that ibn Sultan had crossed the frontier with 120 men and was camped between Subaihiyeh and Tawil, and that he had forcebly seized 30 camels from Kuwait woodcutters on the excuse that they bore Awazim brands, even though the owners had protested that they had purchased same and could prove it. His Excel lency appeared very excited and I could see he had defini tely made up his mind that ibn Saud was about to start his old 'raiding taotics' once more, and that this was the first move, I did mj; best to reassure him by saying the past was gone and H.M, Government would never allow such unprovoked raids as had taken place in the past to happen again, but I do not think he was convinced, I advised the ohaikh to send Shaikh Abdullah al-Jabir his cousin and Commander with six armed Fords to ibn Sultanjjs camp and Politely request him to withdraw, The Shaikh, who appeared to have somewhat lost his head, was horrified at the suggestion and rejected the proposal on the grounds that-3- there might be a fight, which would have disasterous con sequences for himself and Kuwait generally^ Instead he proposed that I should address a letter to both Abdullah an-Nafisi (ibn Saud^ Agent in Kuwait) and another to ibn Sultan direct, with a request to the latter to withdraw and return the camels takeno This I did, and on 87th February I sent Khan Sahib Shaikh Farhan accompanied by an-Nafisi*s man with my letter to Ibn Sultan's camp with instructions to remain with him till he recrossed the bordsM (Translation of my letters to an-Nafisi and ibn Sultan with their respective replies, are attached). I would have gone myself, as I did not share the alarmist views of the Shaikh, only as the following day was the ' ♦Id' 1 , and a great day of ceremonial and calling, I could not spare the time* My messenger returned on the afternoon of the 1st March, with the report that he had found ibn Sultan camped at Thamilat al Turki slightly South of Subaihiyeh and on the frontier line itself. He it seems had not actually entered Kuwait, but his irregulars had done so and had seized the 30 camels complained of near Tawil. Ibn Sultans force was found to consist of 22 regulars, and some 500 tribal irregulars from the Dawasir, Sbei, Awazim, Shaiamar and Harb. These it appears had formed part of ibn Saud^ farce at Khabari Watha, but had re ceived back none of their property stolen by the Akhwan, which had been premised them after the surrender of the Mutair and Ajman, and on their complaining, the King had detailed ibn Sultan to go and see what more he could find in Kuwait* The Shaikh to whom I reported the above showed no signs of abating his anxiety, and begged me to see the matter through myself and not ask him to corres pond with ibn Sultan or ibn Saud on the subject# He made the naive remark that if things went wrong he wanted to be able to throw the blame on me and clear himself withibn Saud # On the 3pd Maxch. and following an urgonl# message from tlie Siiaikli tMt some of ibn Sultan's Awazim irregulars had seized some 30 EsuEi sheep frcm Kuwait subjects and another 7 camels, I again sent Khan Sahib Shaikh Farhan to ibn Sultan with instructions to bring him immediately to Kuwait and see me,, I ordered al#Nafisi to provide a car, and send one of his men also with a similar message (teaaslatdon of my letter lJo c 167 to an-Nafisi is attached,) He confirmed #hat my man had reported in paragraph 6 above, and added that all he wanted was to be allowed to make one more search of the Kuwait tribal camels to see whether the disappointed persons with him cou^d dis* cover any of their property. He added that he desired to do this in peaceful manner, and that he was in no sense out for war or trouble ; that he hoped I would per suade the Shaikh to agree to let him do this® lastly that he had no concern with the Shaikh and only knew me as the chief person in Kuwait. surrender of the rebels to the Royal Air Force and pointed out that in view of Barjas ibn 0thman f s recent search the of/Kuwait tribes which had lasted for 11 days, and which had resulted in the recovery of 302 camels as well as the locating and return of the rebels still wanted, I eould not allow another search on any account, and would advise His Excellency likewise. I pointed out that at the end of his search, Barjas,EKit a responsible official of tbe King ; had personally reported I d me his entire satisfaction bC all the arrangements made, and had assured me that no more rebel camels remained in Kuwait. This I had reported to H.M. Government, and the incident was considered closed. I then requested him to withdraw his men south of Thamilat Turki, as their present position caused alarm and anxiety to the / 8, On tlie 5til of March Ibn Sultan arrived In reply I reoapitulated events from the—o— to the Ruler and his people. This he promised to do, and requested to see the Shaikh. I sent him with a note to His Excellency suggesting that he politely inform ibn Sultan, as I had done, that a search was impossible, and that he should not be over persuaded by the silver tomgue of an-Nafisi, It was up to him, I added, to show a bold front and not submit to ibn Sultan's redi- culous and unreasonable demand# ^ 0 3i the 7th March,. I saw the Shaikh, and he informed me that he had after all decided to allow ibn Sultan to visit his tribes with 3 of his own men only, but only remain there 3 days. The Shaikh pointed out that it was up to him to adopt a 'conciliatory' attitude, as if ibn Sultan returned and reported to his master that he had beem rudely turned back by the Shaikh of Kuwait, there would sure to be trouble. As His Excel lency pressed his point, I waived my objections. His Excellency added that he had impressed on ibn Sultan that he would be allowed to teike ) if found and proved only such camels as:- (1) Had been hidden with Kuwait subjects, (2) Had been given than as presents by the rebels, (3) Had actually been taken in raids by Kuwait subjects (a most unlikely case) Any camels found with Nejd Brands that had been purchased from Nejd subjects, whether rebels or others, and the purchaser could prove before witnesses that he had bought them, would on no account be allowed to be takeau This was according to tribal and Bedouin law. As this was a most satisfactory precautior to have taken and I commended His Excellency for his action. 10. The next scene in the act saw ibn Sultan again visiting me with protests that 3 men and 3 days was quite useless to him. He wanted to take 22 l| men, representatives of eahh of the tribal elements with him ffi?/ ' &gt;&amp;) witli him, and 10 days, in which to carry out the search^ I referred hiM to the Shaikh. ^ter a good deal of talk, and mainly due to the persuasiveness of an-Nafisi, the Shaikh al lowed ibn Sultan f s request and the whole party left on the 14th March for the^Araibdar' and 'Pidawiyeh' camps under the care of Shaikh Abdullah al-Jabir. For convenience the party camped close to the tents of the Coiamandant ^raq. Desert Police, who as reported was dealing with the 'Iraq shepherd tribes, and had formed a camp at Umm al Hiran near Idariat al Khilla. By this arrangement Abdullah al-Jabir was able to supervise the work of both persons# 12# On the 23rd March and at the Shaikh's request I visited Idariat Khilla and found that after 9 whole days search^ all done by motor car and supported by the armed fdrds of the Shaikh^ibn Sultan had only been able to find the following number of camels bearing Nejd brands# (a) 13 camels which had been sent as gifts by^rebels to Kuwait tribal acquaintances a year previous to eventc (tO 55 camels which could be proved to have been bought legitimately. The discomfited ibn Sultan who had already been given the 10 camels (a)begged me to be allowed to take the 62 camels also (b) as he feared to return to Nejd with only 10 anifcmals and have to submit to the blame of his com panions, and the wrath of ibn Saud. As this was against the bargain ^ and entirely contrary to the Bedouin law of ^Arafa', I refused, and ordered him to return to Kuwait# Before I left, lie begged to be allowed to search the 'Iraq tribes camped in the Northern part of Kuwait. This I refused to accede to, as also did the Commandant of Desert Police (Abdul Jabbar Effendi). 13. Ibn Sultan returned to Kuwait on the 24th March and the Shaikh is now engaged trying to get the 37 camels and sheep taken by him near Tawil andand mentioned at the beginning of this report, from himo At the urgent request of ibn Sultan, I have written to E.M.King ibn Saud a personal letter (translation attached) describing what has taken place. The letter was des patched by the hand of an-Nafisi who himself left for Hiath on the 24th March, enroute to the Haj. 14:9 I have described the above events I fear at unnecessary length but I have done so set purpose, in order that if the King shomld complain to H.M.G-overn- ment (as I anticipate he will), that his last agent had been prevented from searching for Nejd camels, which still existed in Kuwait, H.M. Government will be forearmed and will know exactly what reply to give. 15 « ^ point which appears never to have struck the officials of Nejd, from His Majesty downwards, is that immediately prior to the surrender of the rebel Mutair and Ajman to the Royal Air Force, and also during the period ,that those txksM tribes were in the hands of the Royal Air Force, a severe epidemic something like influ enza, swept through the camels of both the Akhwan, Kuwait tribes and I believe the 'Iraq camels tribes, and carried off literaly thousands of aniimals. Kuwait I know lost about i of their stock and that of the rebels was I believe much more, as the disease was agravated by pri vation and camels being continually being driven about.

To Abdullah Al-Nafisi, Wakil of His Majesty the King of Nejd and Hejaz, etc. No. 163. Dated 27th February 1930. After compliments: I have this morning received information that Mohomed Ibn Sultan a servant of His Majesty King Ibn Saud with a regular force (Sirriyahl of about 100 cameMen has entered Kuwait territory near Subaihyeh and is camped between Subaihyeh and Tawil. Further it is reported though it is not yet certain how far this is true, that he is oppressing the Shepherds and woodcutters of Kuwait who are camped in the vicinity, and is compelling them to hand over camels which bear the Awazim ' Wasam^ and which they have purchased for money at different times. As His Majesty's Government does not agree to any of the Nejd regular forces crossing into Kuwait and has a clear understanding with His Majesty King Ibn Saud regarding the crossing of the frontier by the forces of either side, I would request you to immediately inform Ibn Sultan that he should without delay withdraw his force from the territory of His Ezcellency the Sheikh of Kuwait. You should inform Ibn Sultan that if he has any complaint to make against anylof the subjects of Kuwait, he should after moving his men across the frontier come into Kuwait himself and lay his case before me as representing His Majesty's Government in Kuwait. He can be assured that I will see that hehe receives full justice at the hands of the Ruler,to whom he will feie sent by me. I am also sending a letter by Khan Sahib .sarhan al-Rahama who represents me to Ibn Sultan direct, and would request yoy on receipt of this to arrange for him to accompany your man in his motor car. Both should leave to-daji,as the matter is important and delay is undesir able. Usual ending. Sd/ H.R.P. Dickson. L ieut-Col., Political Agent, Kuwait,Letter From Lieutenant-Colonel H.RJP.

As this is contrary to the friendly agreement existing between His Majesty's Government and the King of'Hejaz and Wejd I would request you on receipt of this letter to at once withdraw your men South of the line Mishash, Thamilat al- Turki,and Khalrat al-Duwish,through which places the Kuwait Nejd boundary passes. As it is probable that you have crossed the frontier in error it being a matter of some difficulty for those who do not know to say exactly where the boundary line passes, I am sending Sheikh Farhan and a man of Abdullah al- Nafisi to explain matters to you. It is further stated that you have taken 24 camels from certain Kuwait woodcutters, though there may be no truth in the story. Should it be true how ever you are requested to return the camels,and after sending your men across the border you should yourself come to Kuwait and lay your complaint before me.

It Has been reported to me today that since Sheikh Farhan returned from Subaihiyeh some of the Awazim camped with Ibn Sultan^ have now taken some sheep from Kuwait Subjects. As I am not entirely satisfied of the truth of this story, I have decided to send Sheikh Farhan to Ibn Sultan's Camp and bring him here in person in order that full enquiry may be made from him as to the actual facts of the case. Will you therefore please arrange to again send one of your men to-day in a car with a note from you to Ibn Sultan, asking him to return with Sheikh Farhan to see me and ± settle this business. u sual ending.

After oomplimants ^ow I understand from my friend and Your Majesty's Agent in Siwralt Abdullab al-Nafisi that Your Majesty lias novr arrive^ at Hiath, and I think it xay duty to write and offer my congratulations to Your Majesty on your safe return to Your Majesty* s Home and Capital# I further desire to be among the first, to offer ray deepest fe- leoitations to Your Majesty for having successfully brought to a conclusion the difficult operations which have ended in the complete defeat and submission of your rebellious subjects th6 Mutair and Ajman# Your Majesty's latest /victory carried out as it has been with a minimum of bloodshed has caused Your Majesty* s narae to ring through out Arabia. And the manner in which you have tempered justice with mercy in the final disposal and settlement of the affairs of ^rour repentant subjects, has shown the vb»ld that Your Majesty is a Doctor among Doctors in dealing with the Bedouins. Last of all, I should like to offer my fullest congratulations on the crowning success which has attended Your Majesty's recent meeting with His Majesty Faisal of •Iraq. I received full dotails of everything that hap pened and vras discussed at the conference, from the friend of all jhallch Haflth 'iahba when he passed through Kuwait en route to Baghdad. For Your Majesty*s personal inform ation, I might mention that E.H,Govemment were most highly gratified at the undoubted success of the conference between the two rings of the, Arab world and sent a warm message of appreciation to H.B. the High Commissioner for the part he had taken in bringing about such good results. Your Llajesty will shortly proceed on the HolyHaj and I ask Ood Almighty to protect you on your ! ') journey to dod's House, and to grant you all the favours that are promised to the successful performer of the pilgrimage. As regards the news from our side, She final search and rounding up of those iiutair and AJman rebels who eraded the British force in Itoqit, were oiicceos^ullj carried to a conclusion by Abdullah al- .abir acting under your brother Shaikh load's orders and assisted by Barjas ibn Othman and five other of Xour ilajesty's faithful servants. The search I ^ satisfied was nost vignously carried out for 11 full days, by means of armed motor cars, and not a tent or a camel belonging to the fidawiyeh or the Araibdar.was left unexamined. At the conclusion of the search. I received a personal report from Abdullah al-Jabir Giving exact figures of the number of tents sheep camels etc. belonging to the rebels, which were dis covered and handed over to your servants. I also received a visit from Barjas ibn Otbmn himself accompanied by Abdullah al-ITafisi, and.they both reported that they were more than satisfied with the won that had been dene and with the way the search had been carried out. I believe also that Barjas submitted a full report to Your Majesty on the ship at Sao when he accompanied Ibrahim al-Moamer to the 'Patrick Stewart'. Suffice to say I was much gratified myself on fceceiving the satisfactory report made to me by Barjas and I reported in full detail what had been done both to the Hon'ble the Political Besident in the Persian uulf, Bushire and to Bis Sxcellency the High Commissioner by the aeroplane which reached K.H,S,'Lupin' when Your Majesty was present. Doubtless also H,B, the H.S, the -igh Commissioner discussed my report with Your Majesty, After Your Majesty's return to Hassa from tne conference, Mohamed ibn Sultan another of Your Majesty's servant arrived at Thamilat al lurki on thefrontier and oanped tliereo lie visited iaiwait alone after tlie 'Id, and reported to me tliat he had been ordered to try and find out if tliere were any more Nejd camels still remaining in Kuwait• He mentioned in parti oilar Awasim camels, iis H.ivl.G-overament repre sentative I told liim that it was impossible to allow another search to take place in Kuwait territory seeing that a most through one only a few days before had just been completed by Barjas ibn Othman with five of Your Majesty 1 s own selected seivmts and Abdullah al-Jabir, Also that a full report of the result had only just been submitted to H # M.Government., however at the express request of Your Majesty's brother bhaildi Ahmad who intimated his willingness to allow ibn Sultan to make one final search and examine once more all camel herds so as to leave him no cause whatever for complaint, X expressed my approval. Shailch Ahmad accordingly informed Ibn Sultan who accompanied by 13 selected men from his party set out for the camps of the Araibdar and the Fidawiyeh, accompanied by Abdullah al-Jabir. This was on 14:th March last. Before Ibn Sultan left Shaikh Ahmad explained to him clearly that any camels found that bore Nejd brands, and which could be proved to have been either raided from lM T ejd tribes by Kuwait subjects, who might have secretly joined the Aldiwan immediately before Ingair, or hidden with them by relatives who were with the Alchwan, these would be handed back with out dispute, but that any Nejd camels which had been fairly bought, and the purchase coiild be proved, would not be handed back unless the original owner produced the seme amount of money as was paid by the last pur chaser and gave it him before witnesses. Indeed this is strictly according to tribal law. I trust Tour Majesty will realize that everything possible hag been done fcy E.S. Shaikh Ahmad-4- and myself to assist your officials in bringing about a final settlemait of this vexed question. In view therefore of ova* efforts, I would ask Your i^jesty to be satisfied with matters, and not permit any more of Your Majesty's officials to present themselves at Kuwait with requests to be allowed to make further search among the Kuwait tribes for Kejd camels. Should of course individual tribesmen from Nejd at any time come to claim and be able to prove o-.at a camel of theirs had been stolen or has wandered into Kuwait, he has only to present himself and put for ward his case when full justice would be done him. 'ihis is what had to be said and may Your Majesty be &amp;c. This letter will be brought by Abdullah al Nafisi. Lieut-Col, Political Agent,Kuwaitby air mail.

It is in our interests to do so. There are two ways of doing this: one to Support the Bhaikh and maintain his position by every means possible; the other to take over the administration more or less ourselves. The latter alternative is one that I personally should deprecate and, I think. His l&amp;ijesty's Covernment would too, e5cce,jt as a last resort. It would certainly be most distasteful to the Shaikh* On the other hand one cannot indefinitely prop up a weakling; I want the Shaikh WTUTEHAWT-COLONEL H.R.J?.

I hope Mahomed bin Sultan's activities will prove to have been an isolated case; what 1 fear however is that the Mejd authorities will have gained the impression that Kuwait is afraid of them, and that they can ride roughshod over them with impunity whenever they like. 'i'his will put us in a most difficult position. I am most anxious therefore that you should impress on the Shaikh the necessity of showing some backbone both to Wejd and also to Iraq. His reluctance to punish Iraqis, who had committed thefts in his territories, was another lamentable instance of weakness. If this sort of thing goes on, Iraq and Mejd will both assume that Kuwait is no longer an independent principality. I should think Mubarak must turn in his grave sometimes. I have worded this/somewhat colloquial language, but leave it to you to translate the gist into your own words. the point to make clear however is that Kuwait has not merely two powerful neighbours, but also a third, the British. The distinction between them is however that the third is anxious to maintain the independence of Kuwait and the authority of the Bhaikh. We can howevex' only help the Bhaikh if he will help himself. supposed to address Bin naud except under orders of His Majesty 1 8 Government or of course in an emergency such as occurred last January. your letter was more or less of a personal nature, but still 1 think you would be well advised to go a little slow in these matters, and adhere to the ordinary official procedure in One word more.

Before lie left Kuwait ibn Sultan wrote to ibn Twala (Shammar) and to Ajemi ibn Suwait (Dnafir), who with certain Nejd elements had entered Kuwait territory near the Batin in search of better grazing and ordered them to recross the border at once. Both Chieftains are reported to have replied that as they were in search of grazing there was no objection that they knew of to their entering Kuwait.

They ?;ere there met by some Awazim camelmen of Mohomed ibn Sultan and warned that they could not proceed in the direction of Kuwait as trade with that town was forbidden, 2, The Awazim camelmen further told the members of the caravan that it was lucky they were not Ajman or Mutair otherwise theyyf would have attacked them at once, as it was seeing that they were Harb Bedouin and loyal city^-ens of Bin Saud they were permitted to move up through Kuwait to Zubair and buy supplies there. They were to tell all their friends that Zubair was open to them but definitely not Kuwait# His Excellency added that as far as he could gather the Awazim met the caravans well inside Kuwait territory but he had only the evidence of a member of one of the caravans who subsequently visited Kuwait and left again shortly after* Ibn Sultan*s action in this matter would appear to be the result of fresh orders from Bin Saud and, I fear, is confirmed by Bedouin 'gup' coming on from the desert.5o His Excellency saw in the above incident a reversal of tlie policy of friendly advances recently made by Bin Saud, and believes that having got all he v/ants from Kuwait, he will now reintroduce the old blockade in all its vigour. 6• He suggested that perhaps I would report his conversation to you with a view to representations being ' made to Bin Saud. 7.

This measure is very unpopular as food and clothing is half as expensive again in Zubair as at Kuwait.

Their advanced tents have already reached the latter pj-ace, though the main body is still in the vicinity of Arhaiya, Um Russ, and Thalaat al Dhabba (south of Jahrah)^ It is probable that with the different^ elements wanting to camp at Subaihiyeh, water disputes may arise» (7) ifith the sinnmer drawing near one may expect to see the Bedouin generally moving towards and camping on water* (S) Mohomed ibn Sultan, Ibn Saud's Ciummander is realiably reported to have left for Riath to make his report on recent events in Kuwait, In this connection a very urgent letter to Abdullah al- Nafisi recently arrived from the King (after al- Nafisi's departure for the Haj) asking for the fullest details of Ibn Sultan t s activities, the letter was brought by Dr* Dame of the Bahrain American Mission, when he recently visited Kuwait-3- m ' to consult with other doctors on the serious oondlulon of Dr. Mylrea.

Report hy Captain Gluhh, Administrative Inspector on the Operations on the Iraq-Najd Frontier, from 1st December 1929, to the loth of January 1930, 1. Position of the Najd Hebels in December. —At the commencement of December, the position of the Najd rebels was an awkward one. They had been evicted from Kuwait by British Armoured Cars, and were mov ing southwards towards Lusafa (As Safa) and Jariya. They relied, for their immediate safety, on reports received from their spies, to the effect that Ibn Sand's camels and horses were in too poor condition to allow of an immediate advance. This state of-affairs could not be expected, however, to continue for ever, and with Kuwait apparently closed to them and Ibn Saud with overwhelming forces to the south, their posiiton was anything but enviable. A coldness had arisen between Mutair and the Ajman, since their unsuccessful action with the Av/azim in October. At the same time, Mutair themselves were divided in their councils, and frequent murmurs against the Dnwish's authority began to make themselves heard, Three courses appeared to be open to them. (1) To surrender to Ibn Saud, before he attacked them. Messengers had indeed been despatched to Ibn Saud with this object and had returned with a reply that the surrender of Mutair and the Ajman would be accepted, and that nothing would be done to them except what was prescribed by the Shara , or religious law. This cryptic answer was by no means reassuring. r '52 A considerable immber of the rank and file, however, were in favour ,of unconditional surrender to the mercy of Ibn Sand. It was almost cer tain that he would exact from them a heavy fine in camels, but to lose their property and be safe seemed to them preferable to the risk of losing both their property and their lives. The principal leaders, however, Faisal al Duwish, Jasir ibn Lami, and Ali ibn Ashwan, of Mutair, and Naif ibn Hathlain of the Ajman, expected no mercy of Ibn Saud, and, being in fear of the death penalty^ preferred any course to surrender. , (2) A second possible course was to attempt to break through to Trans- Jordan or Syria, where, it was stated, the Huwaitat and Buwallah were prepared to offer asylum to the rebels. The rank and file of both tribes were, it appears, categorically opposed to this course, which, how ever, was favoured by the principal leaders. (3) The third course was to endeavour to obtain asylum in 'Iraq. The Administrative Inspector, Southern Desert, had recently returned from leave, and it was hoped to obtain from him, by an appeal to the spirit of ancient Arab chivalry (with which he was thought to be conversant), permission to place themselves under the protection of the Government in Iraq. This third course was in reality a form of compromise. It presented certain attractions to both parties, namely those who desired to surrender to Ibn Saud and those who were toying with the idea of fleeing to Trans- Jordan. To the former, it offered the prospect of a gain of time, which would allow them, behind the safe shield of Government forces, to bargain f or terms with Ibn Saud. To those who wished to escape to Trans-Jordan, it offered a safe and convenient route, through Iraq territory, enabling them thereby to avoid the dangerous lateral march from Lusafa to Lina and the Hazul, with the loyalist forces immediately on their southern flank. Eventually therefore all parties agreed to make an attempt to secure temporary or permanent asylum in Iraq. After watering at Jariya and Lusafa, the rebels moved north west. The Duwish and Mutair arrived on 11th December 1929 in the Batin, where they camped between At Ubaid and Adhariyat. Two days later the Ajman entered the Batin at Abrag al Hibari from the direction of Unm Anarat-Mahazul. 2. Arrival of Deputations f rom the Rebels. —On 31st November 1929, the advanced camp of the Southern Desert Force had arrived at Julaida, and numerous Iraq tribes, chiefly shepherds, were scattered over the Neutral Area. On 12th December 1929, a police car patrol from Julaida located the Mutair camps near Ubaid, and captured two prisoners, whom they brought back to camp for coss examination. The prisoners stated that the rebels desired the friendship and protection of the Government, and that the Duwish had despatched a deputation to negotiate. Next day the deputation arrived at the Julaida camp, under the lea dership of Mushrif ibn Lami, and bearing a letter from Faisal al Duwish to the Administrative Inspector. The letter contained merely friendly sentiments, and the somewhat surprising statement that Mutair had always been considered to be natives of Iraq Mushrif ibn Lami vei- bally made a request for permission for the reoels to enter Iraq, where they proposed to become loyal subjects of the Government. Meanwhile, reports had been received from agents, to the effect that the Duwisli had stated his intention, should entry into Iraq be refused to ftirm, to break his way through to the west, whatever the opposition, m order to find sanctuary in Trans-J ordan. The sudden arrival of the rebels at Riqai had been somewdiat unex pected and the Iraq tribes at the moment were dangerouslv_ scattered over the whole Neutral Area. (See sketch No. 1 attached). The Police Post at Julaida was itself on the weak side. Iie239PD63 An immediate and curt refusal to admit the rebels iilto Iraq might it appeared, cause the Duwish, with a part at least of the tribes, to attempt' a break through to the west, a movement which the dispersion of the Iraq shepherds rendered highly dangerous. The Administrative Inspector proposed therefore to temporize for a few days, until the Julaida post was reinforced, and the tribes collected close to it, before returning a definite refusal. Meanwhile, several camps of the Dhafir were grouped at Adhaibah in the Batin, only a few miles from the Ajman, who had arrived at Abrao* al Hibari. The Administrative Inspector accordingly to prevent a clash in this area, suggested the despatch of a section of armoured cars to Adhaibah, until a police post could be established there also. JSTo reply was received from Baghdad to this suggestion but on 15th December 1929, the Administrative Inspector at Julaida received a pri vate message from the Officer Commanding of the section of Armoured €ars, stating that he was proceeding to Adhaiba. The Administrative Inspector assumed that their despatch was in answer to his suggestion and that they would camp at Adhaibah. 3. Attempted eviction of Relets hy Armoured Cars. —On 16th Decem ber 1929, the Administrative Inspector proceeded to Adhaiba, leaving Mushrif ibn Lami in the police camp at Julaida. It was fairly certain that the rebels would not undertake' any further move, until Ibn Lami returned to them with Government reply. In arrival at Adhaiba, he discovered that two sections of armoured cars had been sent out, with direct orders from Air Headquarters to evict the rebels forthwith. Meanwhile, a telegram was despatched by the Ministry of Interior to the Commandant of Police at Julaida, ordering him to dismiss Mushrif ibn Lami forthwith, and forbidding him to hold any further intercourse with the rebels. Next morning, the armoured cars left Adhaiba, accord ing to their orders, to evict the rebels. Thus the hopes of the rebels of obtaining refuge in Iraq, had, appa rently, been destroyed at a blow, and the possibility of their immediately adopting the alternative course of breaking through to the west required urgent consideration. 4. The Alarm at Julaida. —Affairs were in this situation, when, on of 17tl1 Decemb er 1929, the Administrative Inspector at Adhaiba received a message from the Commandant of Police at Julaida, stating that he had that day located large forces of Mutair and the Ajman &lt;at a point thirty-five miles east of Julaida. That the tribesmen, on seeing the cars, had put up fire and unfurled flags for war that they were advancing on Julaida and would probably attack the post that night. feuch an attack, in view of previous reports, the hastly attempts by armoured cars to evict the rebels from Iraq, and the dismissal of Ibn . anil s deputation, was by no means impossible. Meanwhile the drawing le ra( l tribes in the Neutral Area to Julaida and the reinforcement ot the police post, had not been completed. The Commandant of Police was obviously nervous.

The distances involved must gam be remembered. The new police camp was forty five miles from55 TToubba and the whole Neutral Area, consisting of rough and hilly country, wis dotted with constantly moving camps. Experience has proved, times out of number, that nomadic tribes cannot be contro led by patrols of police cars operating from a distance of forty or fifty miles behind. 6 Arrival of Loyalist Najd Tribes.— on 14th December 1929, a number of loyalist Najd tribes chiefly Shammar, together with Aiami ibn Suwait and the Dhaflr in Najd, had been camped m Shaib Ciiarim w I igh tlicy rBCGivcd. news oi tli6 anivcil 01 tli6 jjuwisii cit xvck ^ai. Fearing attack, they decided to take refuge with the Government police post and fled incontinently northwards to Julaida. This action is sigm- fi^ant in two directions : Firstly it was surely a testimony to the prestige of the Government that on the same day, December 18thj depntattions arrived at Jnlaida, both from the Najd rebels, imploring with gifts permission to make Dakhala to Iraq, and from Ibn Sand's loyal tribes, requesting per mission to camp close to the police post for protection from the rebels ! It is 'just two years since Faisal al Duwish swore his famous oath to let the daggers of the Akhwan play in the Bazaars of Basrah ! Shammar, under Mishal ibn Tawals, and the Dhafir, under Ajami ibn Suwait, camped at Julaida without waiting for permission, the latter with his Akhwan banner. As one of the Zayyar shepherds remarked, ^ I never hoped, during the last ten years, to see an Akhwan bairaq leader, with his banner tucked under Ms arm, camping for protection in the midst of the Zayyad 7. Arrival and surrender of Ihn MasJihur.- —Meanwhile, on 20th December 1929, a police car patrol encountered Farhan ibn Mashhur ibn Sh'alan, with a following of some sixty men and twenty women, moving past Adhami towards Abu Khuwaima. A little behind him was Faisal ibn Shiblan (Mutair, Jiblan). Both were warned in strong terms to leave Iraq. The latter apparently lost his nerve, and fled back the same night to Riqai. On the same evening, the armoured cars, which had been ordered to return from Abtiyya to Adhaiba after the evaporation of the Julaida scare, encountered Ibn Mashhur near Abu Khuwaima, and camped a mile from his tents. The Administrative Inspector • immediately proceeded to Abu Kuwaima, interviewed Ibn Mashhur, and warned him to leave Iraq. He replied, however, that he preferred to be killed by the Government rather than by Ibn Sand, if he had to die, and invited the Government to massacre him and his followers. On the following day, the Chief Staff Officer, Air Commodore Burnett arrived at Abu Khuwaima from Baghdad. His arrival was, at the time, of the greatest assistance to the Southern Desert Administration. The facts of the situation in the desert, and the intelligence reports and the grazing requirements which control and inspire suggested movements, are quite simple when explained verbally on the spot. The insuperable difficulty in the past has, however, always been to explain the situation to the many different authorities in Baghdad, when telegrams are the only vehicle, and when no freedom of action is allowed to those on the site. In view of Ibn Mashhur's refusal to move, he and his follows were disarmed on 23rd December 1929. Farhan himself was despatched by car to Busaiya for detention, while his camp and retainers followed with their camel under an escort of twenty camel constables. They duly reached Busaiya and camped there five days later. Farhan Ibn Mashhur presents, in every way, a marked contrast to the Mutair and Ajman rebels. To begin with, he was brought up in wealth and comfort, by Xuri ibn Sha'lan, both with Ruwallah and in his town house in Damascus. He is comparatively civilized, claims that he can drive a car, and engaged the Administrative Inspector in a discussion on the relative merits of Buick and Dodge,On tlie other hand, also unlike Miitair and the Ajiman, he appears to have been genuinely infected by fanatical Wahhabism. He en deavoured, at Abu Khuwaima, to save the Souls of the Desert Police but as he commenced his homily with the words ' three years ago, I myself was a kafir as you are he met with little sympathy. 8. The Raid by Muhsin al the unsuccessful return of their second deputation on J 9th December 1929, the rebels were still unable to make up their minds to any definite course of action. Signs of disintegration became apparent. Haif al Fughm and Sultan ibn Muhailib abandoned the Duwish and moved south to Jariya, whence they sent messages of abject surrender to Ibn Saud. The Ajman and the Diyahin Section of Mutair (Mukhlif ibn Jarbu') were still at Abrag al Hibari, forty miles from the Duwish at Dharabin, and showed :no signs of desiring to co-operate with him. The Duwish, with the Barzan, Abaiyat, Dushan and Jiblan Sections, and some of the Rashaida, remained at Dharabin, apparently paralysed by indecision. Possibly his intention was to remain there until Ibn Saud approached, and then flee into Iraq helter skelter, in such a manner that he could not be prevented or turned back. He placed no scouts or picquets in front of his camp, relying entirely on spies at Lusafa for news of Ibn Sand's advance. It apparently never occurred to him that anyone would attack him, except Ibn Saud in person with his whole army. Late in October, Muhsin al Firm (Harb) at Ibn Saud's instigation, had set out to raid the rebels in Kuwait, but, on being told that they were ready to receive him, he had lost his nerve and had turned back without attacking. This futile effort had apparently provoked from Ibn Saud a scornful comment at a public majlis. The jibe had been duly reported to Muhsin al Firm, who set out in December, unknown to Ibn Saud, to wipe out the disgrace by an attack on the Duwish. On 22nd December 1929, Muhsin al Firm with his war banner arrived at Duwaira, (20 miles south west of IJqubba), On 23rd he was at Al Jalt, on the 27th in Shaib Fulaij. The slowness of his advance was in tended to allow time for him to be joined by contingents from the Shamar, under Mishal ibn Tawala, and the Dhafir under Ajami ibn Suwait, the same who had fled to Julaida for protection ten days before. Meanwhile Ibn Saud had reached Lusafa and on 27th December 1929, sent an advanced party of four cars to locate the rebels. The cars entered Kuwait territory as far as the vicinity of Mahazul, where they captured a man of the Diyahin Section of Mntair, camped with the Ajman, and took him back to Lusafa. He informed Ibn Saud of the fact that the Duwish and .Mutair were at Dharabin. At this moment, Muhsin al Firm, unknown to Ibn Saud, was in Shaib Fulaij, and Ibn Saud, unknown to Muhsin al Firm, was at-Lusafa. The STaff; work of the campaign, es pecially in view of the fact that Ibn Saud had some twenty five cars which could have been used for scouting and communications was execrable. At sunset on 28th December 1929, Muhsin al Firm advanced from Shaib Fulaij, with Mishal ibn Tawala and Ajami ibn Suwait on his left. Two hours before dawn, the force came within sight of the Duwish's camp at Dharabin. They halted in the dark, couched their camels and dis mounted to await for the light. Not a scout or a picquet was out, and all the Mutair camps were sleeping blissfully, disturbed only by the occa sional bark of a dog, of the flare of a fire as some restless individual woke and blew the embers to warm his toes. Two miles away, fate awaited silently to destroy the Duwish's military reputation at a blow. -With the first light, the raiders remounted, the war banners were un furled, and the bedouins, camels and horsemen, poured like a torrent on the sleeping camps. As the men of Mutair leaped to their feet, the first impression in every mind was that their assailant was Ibn Saud, whom they knew outnumbered them hopelessly and whom thev had never probably intended to fight. Lc239FD57 With, tlie first instinct of bedouins, the Mutairis ran to their camels, their principal wealth, and the great flock were soon thundering down into the Batin in full stampede, abandoning the tents to the enemy. The first brunt of Muhsin'al Firms attack fell on the Abaiyat and Rashaida who lost almost all they possessed. That of Ajami ibn Suwait on the Jiblan. The Barzan, who were camped near Qasr Bilal, were never perceived by the raiders and escaped scot free. The camels of the Dushan and a portion of the Jiblan escaped across the Batin and past Eiqai. All the camps were abandoned. Muhsin al Firm planted his war banner outside the Duwish's tent, while the latter's mudhif, a large white tent said to have been a present from Ibn Subah, was burnt by the vie- torious enemy. There was no resistance and hence little slaughter. Probably about fifty men and boys were killed. The attackers were perhaps afraid of a counter attack, when the fugitives realized their small numbers and the first surprise panic was over. Anyhow they contented themselves with rounding up the vast num bers of camels which they had captured, probably about five thousand, and after hastily sacking the tents, retired once more to the west. At the request of the Chief Staff Officer, the Administrative Inspector with two police cars had joined the armoured cars at Al Ubaid the evening before, with a view to evicting the Ajman from Abraq al Hibari. On the evening of 29th December, he set out from Al Ubaid to reconnoitre up to the frontier at Shaib al Auja, two miles to the north of which he em countered the first fugitives oh foot. A little further on, a small party of men were found sitting discon solately on the ground round a brush wood fire. Hazzra al Duwish ad vanced to the car, and behind him followed a thick set figure with an un gainly walk, long brown beard, projecting teeth, and cunning little eyes, the face of the wicked Ogre in the fairy story. It was the one-time terror of Arabia, Faisal al Duwish who eleven months before had unfurled his ;green banner at Artawiya declaring that he would not return until he had seized Abu* Hunaich alive or dead. 9- Offev of TevTYis to the H eh els. —On the 29th of December, the day of Muhsin al Firm's raid, the Ajman had been moved by the Administra tive Inspector and Chief Staff Officer from Abrag al Hibari to Mahazul and were due to move the next day to Riqai. During the night of the 29thi 30th, however, fugitives from the Duwish's followers arrived in the Ajman camp, and on the following day the Ajman, not unexpectedly, refused. As a result of a discussion between the Chief Staff Officer and Adminis trative Inspector, the following terms, to be offered to the rebels were thought out :— ( а ) The principal leaders to surrender themselves, and be interned. They would not be handed back to Ibn Saud subsequently unless he promised to spare their lives. Should he refuse to S t ' a ? ®k o nld be made to reside at a place distant from the Iraq-Najd frontier both His Majesty's and the Iraq Gov ernments guaranteeing that they would not be allowed to return to JSJajd or the frontier area. (б) The tribes to surrender unconditionally, when they would be mustered near Jarishan, and disarmed, and a number of animals taken from them as compensation for loot previously raided by them from Iraq. *' leather of a Chia » ^ Capt. jGllub.b, ^58 Armed watli these suggestions, the Chief Staff Officer, proceeded fo Baghdad by air, returning on 31st December 1929. The terns ed had been agreed to m Baghdad, except that it was ordered thft the cliiefs were to be given a promise that they would in nnt ! be handed back to Ibn Sand. This formula was subkituted for the ori ginal suggestion that they should not be handed back unless Ibn Sand agreed to spare their lives. The new formula appeared to the Admhdstra- Inspector to be sailing rather close to the wind, in view of the promise made by His Britannic Majesty's Government and the Iraq Government not to afford asylum to rebels Meanwhile, the rebel chiefs, when thev sur rendered, were to be sent to Basrah. y Letters were written to Naif ibn Hithlain and Faisal al Duwish or- denng them to report to the camp at A1 Ubaid on safe conduct The Duwish, with the remnant of the Dushan and Jiblan Sections, had mean- whde joined the Ajman at Mahzul. The Abaiyat and Barzan Muhsin al Firm's raid, had decided to return to Najd and surrendered to Ibn Sand. Of them, more anon. On 1st January 1930 Faisal al Duwish and Naif ibn Hithlain report ed to the camp at Al Ubaid, and the terms were explained to them Thev were desperately anxious, before agreeing, to ascertain what would be their ultnnate disposal, but as the Administrative Inspector was ignorant of it himself, he was unable to enlighten them. The Shaikhs were parti cularly suspicions of the order that they are to be despatched to Basrah m person, and urgently requested permission to remain camped with their tribes, stating that, m this case, they and the tribes would agree to surrender. Eventually they requested twelve hours grace, to return to their homes and consnlt their friends. They were given sixty honrs to evacuate and Iraq should the terms be refused, after which time thev were warned, that any of them found within these countries would be treated as hostile. they had not returned to camp within the twelve hours they were nGtmed, on the morning of 3rd January 1930, that the terms were consi dered to have been rejected, and that they must evacuate Iraq and Kuwait betore dawn on the 5th January 1930. All the rebels thereupon struck r ?? 1 Ma]lzul ? and mov ed south west, through Umm Amarat Mahzul. AU tins time there was no news of Ibn Saud. Mahsin al Firm had retired loot ^ w ^ ere was re P or t«d to be employed dividing up his enormous 10. FligJit and ultimate surrender of the Eehels—On the afternoon ot 5th January 1930, however, the leading rebels after pitching camp near umm Amarat Mahzul, suddenly packed up once more, and set out at full speed towards Jahra, travelling all night, and all the following day. The aesert in their wake was strewn with camels and sheep, exhausted by the lorced inarching and abandoned in their flight. The reason for this rapid flight was not at first quite obvious, until on the evening of 5th January 1930, a message was received by the Ad- mmistrative Inspector from the police post at Al Ubaid, stating that Ibn ^aud had camped at Eiqai. Doubtless some Mutairi, of whom there were many in Ibn Sand's army, had slipped away from the loyalist forces and warned his relatives in the rebel camp of Ibn Sand's proximity. -Offl i ^ m ™ s t ra ^i ve Inspector, at the request of the Chief Staff mcer, had accompanied him and the Armoured Oars into Kuwait terri- 0] T&gt; permission to do so having been obtained from Kuwait, and there emg no sign of the arrival of the Political Agent, Oolonel Dickson. 4 i ^ sunrise on 6th January 1930, the armoured cars column overtook fpj® ^chng rebels in flight, near Al Atraf, fifteen miles west of Jahra. e rebels were completely demoralised, none knew where they were going nail C0T1 1 ail y Shaikhs be discovered, but all were equally bent on flying -mall to the north west, away from Ibn Sand's army, which they69 imagined to be at their teals, (unaware that he was obliged to halt at the frontier^ , was mad e to round up the fugitives west of A1 Atraf, with ...

On 6th January 1930, on reaching A1 Atraf, the Admmistrative Inspector returned to his post at A1 Ubaid Colonel Dickson being ex pected to loin the Armoured Car column and take over Political control. The rest of the story, though it took place in Kuwait and only in directly affected Iraq, may be briefly told. The rebels on reaching JahS were again torn by divided councils. While atemptmg to round them up a few bombs had been dropped m front of them by aircraft, and the rebels apparently conceived the idea that they were about to be attacked by ^Thr'm^oritv of the Jiblan and Rashaida sections of Mutair decided to make a dash for Jariya, intending to throw themselves on the mercy of Ibn Shukair, a Mutair chief who made his peace with Ibn Sand and who it was hoped, would act as go-between and secure favourable terms for them. A few camps of the Ajman, in the same manner, decided to try to reach the Hasa, to join Ibn Jama', a loyalist shaikh of the Ajman. All were intercepted by Ibn Sand's forces on 9th January 1930, near Khabari Wadhha, and put to the sword. On 9th January 1930, Naif Ibn Hithlain surrendered to the armoured car column at Jahra, and Faisal al Duwish and Jasir Ibn Lami followed his example on the ensuing day. All were sent by air to Shaibah, and detained on a British ship in the Shatt al Arab. The remanants of the Dushan and Diyahin Sections of Mutair, and the greater part of the rebel Ajman, were instructed to move northwards to the Jarishan-Raudhatain area. 11 Arrival of Ibn Baud at Bigai.— already stated, Ibn Sand, on arrival at Lusafa (As Safa on map), sent a party of four cars to recon noitre for the rebels. These captured a prisoner at Mahazul who informed them that the Duwish and Mntair were at Dharabin. This was on the.28th December. Ibn Saud decided to advance to the attack. Great precautions were taken to prevent th.e escape of spies from Lusafa to warn the rebels. In the interval, unknown to Ibn Saud, Muhsin Al Firm raided Mutair on the 29th, and the fugitives fled northwards across the Kuwait frontier. Meanwhile, after Muhsin al Firm's raid, the remnants of the Abaiyat Section fAli ibn Ashwan) and the Barzan Section (Ali Abu Shuwairibat) decided to flee to Jariya and appeal to Ibn Shukair for his good offices. They were, of course, unaware that Ibn Saud was at the moment leaving Lusafa to meet them. On 31st December 1929, an advanced guard of four motor cars pre ceding Ibn Saud's army, located Ali Ibn Ashwan on the move, in the open plain south west of Al Musannat. A car was sent back to inform Ibn Saud, and Muhammad, third son of the King, with the remaining cars available, immediately reinforced the advanced guard. The loyalists were warned that, should any man spare the life of a Mutairi, his own would be forfeit, and they were reminded that these were the men who had so often raided and looted them in the past. (Ibn Saud has recently always urged the memory of the past battles to incite his troops. In 1919, Mutair, then Ibn Saud's most devoted followers, massacred the whole Juhaish Section of Shaminar at Julaida, the Juhaish being loyal to Ibn Eashid. Last year, at Sibilla, Ibn Saud drove the Shammar to frenzy, by inciting them before the attack with the cries of ' Remember Julaida ', quite regardless of the fact that, although Mutair were the murderers at Julaida, Ibn Saud himself was the general !).60 The cars encircled the rebels on the north, while Ibn Sand with Ids main army attacked from the south. Ibn Ashwan,' and his devoted fr,i lowers, surrounded and outnunibered ten to one, now walked round their flocks, and fired steadily inflicting considerable casualties, until they were overwhelmed by numbers, and all, except the women, were put to death. A halt was made after the action, and at sunset, two other cars which had been scouting to the west, returned to report that another section was , on the move south-west of the army. This was the Barzan, who had crossed m front of Ibn Sand's army, ahead of Ibn Ashwan, and were making for Janya. Orders were issued for a pursuit next morning Meanwhile, however, the Barzan had apparently become aware of the presence of Ibn Saud s army, and possibly of the fate of Ibn Ashwan All Abu Shuwainbat and Mutlaq ibn Hanaiya left their tribes at dusk' and riding through the night, broke into the tents and fell at Ibn Saud'» feet soon after midnight, before they could be prevented or recoo-nized^ Having reached the tents, their lives were spared. These actions delayed the advance of Ibn Baud's army, and it was not until 5th January 1930, that he reached and camped A1 Eiqai Prom the Barzan prisoners, he received the first news of Mnhsin al Firm's raid On reaching Riqai, he found no rebels south of the frontier. His ad vanced guard, consisting of some forty horsemen and two hundred camel- men under Mashari ibn Busaiyis, the loyal Mutair Shaikh, penetrated into Kuwait as far as Mahazul. Near Ash Shuqaiya,. they located three Iraq tribesmen, two Shammaris and a Dhafiri. The two former were killed, with rifle fire and dagger wounds, their riding camels and rifles be ing looted. No compensation was ever received from Ibn Saud for this outrage. On 7tli January 1930, a party of horsemen from Ibn Sand's camp raided the Said Section of the Dhafir near Shaihiyyat, looting forty-five camels. * Two police cars which were in the vicinity, took np the pursuit, but owing to pours of heavy rain and soft mud, were unable to overtake the raiders, and reached Shaib al Aujah in time to see them drive their loot into Ibn Sand's tents. A strong protest was instantly despatched to.Ibn Saud, and, on the following morning, a written letter of apology was re ceived, accompanied, however, by only thirty-seven camels. The remain der have not been returned. The incident, troublesome as it was at the time, caused the present writer, in a manner, some amusement. At Jidda and elsewhere, Ibn Sand's minions have been inclined to look down, their noses at Government repre sentatives, saying rather superciliously that Ibn Saud is the only man who can govern wild bedouins., The boot would appear to be somewhat on the other leg. ^ Though in the past years, tribes camped in Iraq may have raided ^sTajd contrary to Government orders, there is no record of bring ing their loot back to a G-overnment post, as these did in broad dav light to Ibn Sand's tents. On the following day, another Iraq tribesman near Shaib al Auja, was approached by a party of Najd camelmen. On being asked who he w as, the Iraqi foolishly replied ' Min ashair* Abu Hunaich ', an answer ^ Inch elicited a volley of musketry, and only luck and a fast camel saved •uis life. .Other minor incidents of the same kind occurred, and it was therefore witii some relief that, on, 8th January 1930, we observed Ibn Sand's 311001l t of the Batin past Riqai towards the East. The water U tne latter well was insufficient for his army, and he was compelled to ttove to Khabari Wadha, where large rainpools had been reported. u God save us from oux friends'. 32. Intercourse mitji Um Sand's Messenger at Al Ubaid. —On 5th • amiary 1930, a party of three cars arrived at the post of Al Ubaid, con- ^ ining Yusuf al Yasin, a Syrian lawyer and journalist, Ibn Sand's sec- £rary x0r pro paganda, the press, and: foreign Governmental affairs, Turk! lc239FD *' From tiie tribes of Gapt. Grlubb61 as Sadairi a townsman of 'Aridh aiid relative of Ibn Sand and Mnnow- wakh Aba Ithnain, of tlie Shaildily family of the Sebei. Ynsnf was the spokesman and presented a letter from Ibn Sand to the Administrative Inspector, requesting to know what steps would be taken by His Majesty's Government to fulfil their pledge not to allow the rebels to enter Kuwait. Yusuf Yasin added a tirade on his own behalf, against the remissness of His Majesty's Government. The Administra tive Inspector replied that, in his capacity as an official of the Iraq Gov ernment he was quite unconcerned with the intention of His Majesty's Government, as he was likewise with those of the Kuwait authorities, and that there was no use arguing with him about it. He, however, gave a full account of all that had passed and added that, as a private individual and not an official, he had no doubt that His Majesty's Government were determined to take every step to fulfil their pledges. He agreed to arrange for the despatch of wireless messages for Ibn Sand from the police set at A1 Ubaid. Yusuf Yasin accordingly despatched two telegrams, one to His Excellency the High Commissioner in Baghdad, and one to the Resident Persian Gulf. In both, he requested on behalf of Ibn Sand (a) That the rebels evicted from Kuwait. (b) Or that Ibn Sand be given permission to enter Kuwait to attack them. In the event of His Majesty's Government not adopting one or other of these courses, Ibn Sand would be reluctantly compelled to return to his home, but the responsibility for all future disturbances on the frontier would then, of course, rest on those who had given asylum to the rebels (i.e., His Britannic Majesty's Government). This note was quite on the lines of the usual Ibn Sand protest-cum- threat communication. These notes are, of course, drafted by Yusuf Yasin, whose half mature and rather offensive lawyer mind delights in making a point which he thinks will enable him to score a hit later on, when the time comes for exchanging mutual reproaches over the next regrettable incident. Between coming and going, Yusuf Yasin and his companions spent some three days in the camp at A1 Ubaid. He periodically launched into recriminations against His Majesty's Government, until reproved. A curious mixture of the modernistic Syrian journalist and the Wahabi fanatic, he endeavoured, in a rush moment, to convert the Commandant of Police to the True Path. Hasan Fehmi Beg, however, appeared to know more of the Quran by heart than he did, and the apostle was put to com fusion. On one occasion, a flight of aircraft passed over the camp, when Yusuf Yasin was present. He watched them for a short time disappearing to the south, and gave vent to loud shrieks of protest to, the effect that they were crossing the frontier. He then requested an interview with the pre sent writer, and delivered an impassioned protest. The Administrative Inspector, who was becoming rather tired of this kind of thing, replied that he had not least idea where the aircraft had come from or where they were going. But he would like Yusuf Yasin to understand that both His Majesty's Government and the Gov ernment of Iraq had undertaken great trouble and expense in these operations, in order to assist Ibn Sand. The object of both sides was one. If, however, Yusuf Yasin was on the look-out for chance to make protests, the Administrative Inspector was quite prepared to accept his challenge. To begin with Ibn Sand's scout cars and subsequently his advance guard of horse and camelmen had penetrated as far as Mahazul in Kuwait territory, a fact which the Administrative Inspector and Commandant of Police had not at the time reported to their Government, fully realizing that^ the frontier was ill-defined and the trespass (possibly) unintentional. This reply produced the desired effect. On another occasion, the Administrative Inspector tackled Yusuf Yasm on the subject of the innumberable and captious protests constant-62 ly despatched by his Government He pointed out, with examples that many of the protests were lies, while others attributed to the Iraa Gov eminent ulterior evil motives, which tliey in reality never possessed. In reply, Yusuf first stated that all the, Najd protests had been based on statements made m the Iraq press He afterwards, however, admitted that Ibn Sand had desired to multiply protests during 1928 and 1929 ' to prove the evil effects of the existence of the desert posts Turki as Sadairi and Mnnowwakh Abu Ithnain, were verv much better fellows than the Damascus journalist, of whom, indeed thev spoke somewhat slightingly, saying that he never showed his nose in Naid and only bobbed up when it became a question of talking to Government officials. Both these individuals stated that Ibn Saud was very grateful for Government help regarding the rebels, and that his former suspicions of Government intentions and of the Administrative Inspector in person had completely vanished. The royal fleet of ' armed cars ' which consisted principally of ancient Chevrolet trucks mended with biscuit boxes and bits of petrol tins, arrived at Riqai on its last tin of petrol, and the royal army was there reduced to immobility until supplied with petrol through the Iraq police. His Majesty requested permission, should petrol be unobtain able, to deposit the mechanical branch of his Army at A1 Ubaid, as guests of the Administrative Inspector, and to complete his campaign on horses and camels. 13. Ihn Sa'ud's Arm?/.—The total number of Ibn Sa'ud's followers in the field was difficult to estimate, as no officer visited his camp, and tribesmen are erratic wlien cross-questioned regarding numbers. The Royal tent was said to be surrounded by about figty others, presumably negroes and personal retainers, whose numbers might thus be placed at about four hundred. There were also other tents, chiefly occupied by the town contingents, and by notables or Shaikhs. The bedouin contin gents were mostly all bivouacking in the open, and their numbers were therefore difficult to estimate. The townsmen may have amounted to three thousand, and the total to about seven or eight thousand, at a guess. The principal contingents present were :— Townspeople of Central Arabia, Qasim, Washm, Aridh. Harb, under Hi jab ibn Nahit. (Muhsin al Firm went home after his raid). Mutair, under Masbari ibn Busaiyis. 8ebei. Qahtan. Dawasir. Ataibah, under Ibn Eubai'an, and Manahi al Haidhal. An independent army was, at the same time, holding Northern Hasa, with contingents from :— The Hasa townsmen, Bani Hajir. Bani Khalid. Al Murrah. Ibn Musa'ad was also in the field at Zibala, to close the Duwish's way &lt;51 escape to Trans-Jordan. He had with him the contigents of :— Townspeople of Hail and Jabal Shammar. Shammar Akhwan, under Milbas ibn Jibrin and Ghadhban ibn Eimal. On the total of the three armies, Ibn Saud probably had some 16,000 ftien in the field. This is probably very nearly the maximum effort of which Najd is capable. To water and feed such large forces in the desert, with no system of commisariat, is, in itself, no mean feat.63 Ibn Sand's force was accompanied also by between 25 and 30 cars. A nnmber of these, as already stated, were rickety Shevrolet trncks, to which eight or ten negroes clung somewhat precariously. There was also a* sprinkling of touring cars, amongst which a Buick and a new Ford (with all back springs broken and the body resting on the back axle, but quite undismayed thereby) were noticed. There were said to be also five machine guns. 14. Effect of the operations on the Iraq Tribes. —The first news of the arrival of the Duwish at Kiqai, combined with the flight of the Najd Shammar and Dhafir to the protection of the police at Julaida, produced great elation in the Iraq tribes. Firstly, as the outward and the visible sign that they and their Government were supreme. Secondly, because they anticipated an early opportunity of recovering some at least of the crushing losses which they have suffered in the last ten years. They, at first, anticipated an immediate attack by Government forces on the rebels, and many chiefs hastened to the post at Julaida, begging to be of the party. With the arrival of the deputation and their offer to return Iraq loot, public opinion veered to the view that their property would be handed over without a struggle. Bitter disappointment ensued when the deputation was dismissed, and the rebels were warned not to enter Iraq, without any mention of the repayment of loot. During the past two years, considerable jealousy has grown up between the Bhafir in Iraq, and those of the same tribe who have gone over to Najd. Each party has endeavoured to prove the advantages of the course adopted by it, the Majd Dhafir loudly proclaim tbe vast re wards and honours heaped on them by Ibn Sand, While those in Ira^ are equally zealous in their praise of the Government. The presentation of an Akhwan bairaq to Ibn Suwait last spring caused bitter resentment in Iraq. The precipitous arrival of Ajami at Julaida in early December, with his war banner, so to speak, tucked under his arm, caused much jubilation, and those were not lacking who pointed out that, after all, in a tight corner, it appeared that the Govern ment was a safer refuge than Ibn Sand. Disappointment, therefore, turned to Venomous resentment, when Ajami, leaving his camp in safety near Julaida, joined Muhsin al Firm, and secured an amount of loot almost undreamt of. His personal share alone was between one hundred and fifty and two hundred camels. Ajami, returning in triumph with his hitherto virgin bairaq, greeted the Iraq tribesmen with taunts of ' go and sit at home with your wives '. Infuriated deputations poured into the Administrative Inspector's camp, vociferating that Government, by its prohibition against raiding, had destroyed their honour and name, that Ajami, with his tin-pot banner, had won fame and wealth while Government protected his tents, that the camels of Hutair were rightly theirs, who had endured martyr dom and ruin for years at Government orders, and more in the same strain. There was no reply to be made to these assertions, as thev were all true. ^ Jada'an ibn Suwait, with more courage than sense, took the law into his own hand and deliberately attacked the assembled Ajman at Mahazul, with a force of thirty men. The enterprise naturally ended in disaster, the Ajman Fizza'ed, and Jada'an was put to complete route with a loss of three killed. The arrival of Ibn Saud at Riqai was the sign for a further effer vescence. Next day, horsemen, camelmen and foot poured in from all dii ections to the post at Al Ubaid. Some anticipated a combined attack on the rebels, and hoped to be in at the death. Others alleged that they had. heard that u this Southerner ' (Ibn Saud) was throwing his weight about, and wished to show him that the Government had its fight- ttk ^} en as ke* Several hundred fighting men collected at Al U baid, within two days.64 The murder of the two Iraqi tribesmen by Ibn Saud's advance guard and the subsequent raid by the party of horsemen on the Dhaflr only added fuel to the fire. The Administrative Inspector urgent!? suggested to Baghdad that tyro thousand camels be taken from the rebels immediately, and distributed to the Iraq tribes. This, while out of all proportion to their past losses (which are probably equivalent to some 25,000 camels, omitting the enormous losses of human life) would have pacified them for the moment, and enabled them to blow out their chest« and go home saying what tremendous fellows thev and their Government were. But, in Baghdad, the matter remained under consideration. Those who estimate bedouin gains and losses in terms of loot alone are always wide of the mark. Imaginative, hot-tempered, independent' and proud, as well as avaricious, ' honour ' is almost as dear to them as loot. Interminable stories of wars and raiding occupy long evenings round the camp fires, and are perpetuated in innumerable ballads. The man who sits peacefully at home while his peers are gainine fame anrl wealth, is scarcely worthy the name of man 8 Eventually Jada'an ibn Suwait, Mishal al Timyat, Hawwai ibn Hallaf and others, seeing Government still inactive, went on to Riqai and joined Ibn Saud's -army. Jada'an received a cash present of one thousand rupees, a suit of clothes and twenty five camels and joined Ms army. All, it is believed, received loot at the subsequent action at Khabari Wadhha. Ajami ibn Suwait passed the post at Al TJbaid, at the head of the Dliafir in Najd, with his war banner ostentatiously displayed, and joined Ibn Sand at Eiqai. Meanwhile a fury of revenge had seized even the shepherds in Iraq. Unawaie of the exact situation, but hearing vaguely that IVTutair were in the Batin, horse and foot poured across the Dibdibba from the Stony Desert to the Batin. Pew had any definite idea of what they meant to do, but a general cry of ' Mutair are defeated. Revenge, loot, kill ' was in the air. A police car passing J an Khirsan on its way from Bnsaiya to A] Ubaid, encountered an old shepherd, half bent with age, and armed with a stick, running across the desert towards the east. Seeing the car, he called out ' va Walad ! where is the Batin ' In front of you, my uncle, replied the police, what do you want there ' The Duwish ! the Duwish !' shouted the old man u he killed my boy !' and he shambled oft across the desert, shaking his stick. Those who regard Iraq-Najd relations as a mere political problem, and who have never seen the results of Akhwan raids at first hand, can not visualise the agony, slaughter, terror and bereavement, which the Iraq tribes have endured for ten years, nor the depth to which it has sou l s - the present writer has so often said before Massacre ^ is the key to the situation ' ? . The dead cannot now be Drought to life again, but at least it is the duty of all to see that the victims obtain all that is possible in compensation for their looted property. : !

Extract from Report dated the Id of of the Southern Desert. ii Events in Najd, —The Conference between the Political Resident in 1W) +if iai1 an( ^ -^ n having been concluded on 26th January ji 7 the British forces in Kuwait commenced immediately to shepherd e fugitives tribes back to the Najd frontier. The tribes proceeded slowly past Jahra to the Minaqish area, where e y were handed over to representatives of Ibn Sa'ud. ^ reported that, on their arrival, they were met by a force of l . elmen, composed principally of the townsmen of the 'Aridh pro-' 65 The rebels were first ordered to drive out all animals in their possession which had been raided from other Najd tribes since the com- 'mencement of the rebellion, and were warned at the same time that, if .any such animals were subsequently found with the rebel flocks, the severest penalties would be exacted. It is said that several thousand camels were handed over by the fugitive sections in this manner. Ibn Sa'ud's men then rounded up the remaining rebel flocks, and examined them. All riding camels were first taken, and an order was given for the surrender of all mares. It is stated, however, that only about one hundred and twenty mares were collected. The remainder, as a result of the battles of the past year and the recent forced marches of the tribe to Jahra, to Jarishan and then back to Najd, were either dead or too weak to travel. The question of the disarmament of the rebels is not quite clear, but it appears that few if any arms were practice collected. Finally, a further inspection of the flocks was carried out, and some two thousand six hundred of the best milch and baggage camels were collected as a fine. On a basis of numbers, probably two-thirds of the camels with the rebel sections from Kuwait were seized by Tbn Sa'ud. but as the animals taken were, in addition, all the ^most valuable, it may well be that three quarters of the cash value of their flocks was con fiscated. The tribes were thereby rendered almost immobile, and permis- sion was granted them to remain camped near Minaqish until their remaining camels were sufficiently rested to move their camps. Of the Dawish's famous flock of all black camels known as the 44 Sharf ' which formed a rallying point for Mutair in war, about 100 animals were seized by Ibn Sa'ud, and presented to his third son, Muhammad ibn Sa'ud, only about twenty of the black camels being left with the Dushan. From Bedouin sources, it is reported that, when Faisal al Duwish, Naif ibn Hithlain and Jasir ibn Lami reached Ibn Sa'uds camp by air, they were led before the King in front of a large majlis. Each in turn was brought forward, and asked by Ibn Sa'ud the reason for his rebel lion. It is said that the-Duwish candidly replied that his object had been to overthrow the rule of the Sa'ud family. Ibn Hithlain is said to have shrugged his shoulders and answered ' ' Qasma ' or fate, while Jasar ibn Lami pointed to the Duwish and said u That is the man who led us astray '. The prisoners, it is said, were put in chains and sent by car to Riyadh. On arrival, it is said that they were introduced one by one into the cell, where Sultan Ibn Humaid lay in chains, and told to greet their friend. Gossip relates that the Duwish and Ibn Humaid embraced one another, weeping, Naif Ibn Hithlain refused to enter the cell until forced in by the guards. After this scene, which appears, if true, to have been done out of mockery, the prisoners were confined in separate rooms. On 16th February, Ibn Sa'ud moved to Jariya, dismissing the greater part of his forces, the principal shaikhs, however, accompanied inm, in the hopes of receiving gifts from the camels which had been seized from Mutair. It is reported that, on arrival at Jarya, a further one thousand seven hundred camels were collected from Mutair Sections which had surrendered or returned to Jarya earlier in the operations. As a final sign of triump, Ibn Sa'ud himself married at Jarya, the wile o± the late Azaiyiz, the son of Faisal al Duwish, who was killed in .battle with Ibn Musa'ad six months ago. To take the wife of his .aeieated enemy seems to be regular (if rather primitive) custom of Ibn fca ucl, as, after the capture of Hail, he took the wife of Ibn Eashid in the same manner. lc239fd—30—1-8-30— gips.l/ D - 0 - No 223 - tto ests ipra 19S0 .

I entirely agree with you that the Shaikh showed deplorable weakness over the ibn Sultan case, and I confess his going behind my advice, and allowing al-Nafisi to get round him and persuade him into allowing ibn Sultan to go to Urn el-Hiran and conduct a further search, after he had promised me he would be firm, was the cause of my first open quarrel with him. On hearing what had happened I called upon him and told him exactly what I thought of him. High words followed^ for I am afraid I did not mince my words especially when he tried to justify his conduct.Xater when he calmed down and admitted he had been foolish, we made it up and parted friends, but without doubt tlie Sliaikli did make an Tt ass f, o;f himself. 3. I gave him the message contained in your demi- official referred to above ; and he had not much to say^ as you merely suppcjfeed what I had already rubbed in when I had had my 'outburst' with him. He did acknowledge however, that he knew full well that you tod His Majesty's G-overnment were his true friends, and that he quite re alized that both 'Iraq and Nejd were like a couple of dogs and that Kuwait was the bone, but using his words, he said r he would like to see the biggest dog namely H.M G-overnment show a 'little more activity than it had done Hobble Lieutenant-Colonel H, Y, Biscoe, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B u s h i r e.m dealing with these two smaller dogs. eight years one of these had been hurting him sorely, and had not only bitten off and swallowed a bit of the bone itself, but had taken much of the meat still adhering to the lin bone, yet all along it the big f rl endly dog had done precious little to help. Only once It had rushed in and prevented the entire bone being swallowed up. (Meaning the Defence of Kuwait by the Wavy). The second smaller dog too (•&amp;£) had not been entirely inactive ; but by more stealthy methods was trying to get at the bone, but this animal was much- more gentlemanly, and after all hated the Nejd dog also, so in a sense it was a friend, 4. I give the above parable in as near the words of the Shaikh as possible^o show that ?7hile he knows we are his j-riends^he does feel a certain amount of resentment against us for what he calls our letting him down, but what is more important to my mind, it shows that he some how these days does not appear to have that confidence in us which he ought to have, which in other words means^ that he is being got at by someone or other, and without doubt this is the * Iraq nationalist party. 5, v This brings me to a quite new feature of Kuwait politics namely the rather startling efforts which I am' convinced, are now being made to get the Shaikh to look favourably on 'Iraq, with what idea in view is not difficult to guess. 6, Though it would be most difficult to prove anything^ there is little doubt in my mind that important Basrawis who come down on visits, or who own property in Kuwait, are by order ; actively engaging themselves in anti-British propaganda as well as preaching the doctrine of the amal gamation of Kuwait with 'Iraq. Similar preaching goes on in Basrah, I am told, among the big Kuwait business men and date garden owners. 7. The movement is I believe new, and the propagandists ; methods take the following line:- England is made out to be 'finished' as a resultof the great war. and to be slowly 'going down'. in Egypt, 'Iraq, Persia, the Persian Gulf and India are held up as 'proof' positive that everyone who tries can successfully throw off England's 'yoke', ae Shaikh and the people of Kuwait are told that they must join in the general movement. In England's place Kuwait must accept the overlordship of Nejd or 'Iraq. Of the two, Kejd will obviously swallow her up. while 'Iraq will take her to her bosom as a long lost prodigal. That 'Iraq will treat Kuwait well, and allow her to retain her quasi-independence is of course rubbed in, but it is equally well rubbed in that as her interests (mercantile and land) are ^closely bound up with Basrah, t^t she can no longer continue as she has done in the past and must act. The main thing these gentry promise, a'Kd I am told^is that 'Iraq will guarantee xuiwait against all Hejd aggression in future, and will allow the Shaikh to retain his gardens at Eao free of taxation as at present, 8. Such is the form of^ntrigue and] propaganda ^hat as/ iar as i can make out is being actively disseminated from Baghdad and Basrah today and: though the principle is old, it is being disited up in new-form, i 9« ThougiL much of what I have said may sound fantastic perhaps, one must not forget that the above kind of sug gestive talk $9^ is for ever at dinner parties, receptions &amp;c^ being drumed into the ears of the Ruler } already a weak man and ready to believe most things^by his 'Iraq and Kuwait so called friends. I rather suspect one of these to be the pleasant and charming Seyed Hamid Beg al-Naqib who is perhaps the most intimate friend the Shaikh has, and who keeps some 15 lacs of the latters private money, manages his affairs in Basrah, and occupies his best house there. This person outwardly engages in trade, and has the Basrah-KuY/ait Postal Contract, and for nearly half the year resides in Kuwait. It is worthy of note that he recently entertained and 'put up' the T Iraq delegation which came to Kuwait headed by the Minister of Interior,also he looked after the Mutasarif of Basrah, and'the present Mutasarif of Imara who both came down during the 'Id' holidays, Seyed Hamid Beg is now on a mysterious visit to Baghdad. 10. It may merely be an accident but it is worth mentioning I think, that whereas formerly every hindrance was put in the way of Kuwait subjects acquiring property and date gardens round Basrah, there quite recently has been a change of policy and Kuwaitis have now no difficulty in buying all the lands they want# 11. The Shaikh with all his personal charm, is a very simple minded person and has had no education beyond what he has taught himself, indeed he did not know how to read or write till a few years back. It is not to be wondered at therefore that with this sort of wild talk continually reaching him, he should sometimes, show strange unaccount- able weakness and vac^illation. 12. That Shaikh Ahmad honestly likes the British and would like to trust us through thick and thin, is patent to anyone who knows him as I do, but I sometimes fear that in his heart he never feels quite sure how far we English are going to stand by him in the hour of need. He has also only myself to advise him and possibly a dozen sturdy old notables of Kuwait. Against this in fluence is the ever filtering in 'Nationalist' poison from 'Iraq^and carried by both 'Iraqis and the rising generation of Kuwaitis brought up in Basrah, IcSc^^Xy, These f especially the 'Iraqis are plausible persons, and the facts they marshall, as for instance that Great Britain is a 'spent force', must largely appear true in the eyes of simple man like the Shaikh, if rubbed in sufficiently often and long. Curiously enough the Shaikh had the same thing 7 suggested to him by Ibn Saud recently who told him that he Shaikh Ahmad took his advice he would cease placing reliance on H.M # Government, and would do well to come to some de finite agreement with Nejd, for Great Britain only^ sowed-5- 3-4^ discord among Arab States for her own purposes. - was said at Khabari Watha. and was told m e as a fact by Shaikh Ali al-Khalifa and the Shaikh hi ms elf q uite recently. (Entirely typical to tell me months' afterwards) 12. I have written, I fear, at length and only hope I have not taxed your patience too long. The point I [ wanted to bring out is that there is dirty work afoot these days, but so far I can do no more than generalize I should not be surprised to see something definite develop shortly, m the meantime my relations 2e/b1st with the Ruler, and I never tire of giving him advice. I'm not so sure that a visit to England would not be a good move, and be a healthy antidote to the miserable stuff he forever hears and reads. He takes in several Egyptian newspapers and the 'Iraq dailies of course.
