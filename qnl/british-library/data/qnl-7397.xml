W. BRAZ1ER-CREAGH, A.M.S. s 1897 . CALCUTTA: OFFICE OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF GOVERNMENT PRINTING, INDIA.[CONFIDENTIAL.]%From SURGEON-MAJOR BRAZIER-CREAGH, A.M.S., To The SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT of INDIA, FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. Dated Peshawar, the 12th March 1898. Sir, I have the honour to submit herewith a record of my mission to Seistan. In forwarding this report I beg leave to point out that from the outset my orders were of a very ambiguous nature, merely stating “I was to proceed with utmost dispatch to Seistan. My primary duty would be to take and advise such general measures as may be possible to guard against risk of the importation of plague from Baluchistan, particularly by the Nushki-Chagai route.” It will, therefore, be seen that the above orders nominally appointing me on plague duty, in other respects gave me no definite instructions or insight as to what line to pursue. After due consideration and before reaching Seistan, I fully realised that my mission, to be successful, involved other duties more important and intri cate, and that my primary duty would be equalled, if not surpassed, by political ones in watching British interests, especially commercial interests, and the doings of the Russian agents in the country. The diaries and letters forwarded from time to time, copies of which are attached and form Appendix A of this report, briefly describe all matters of urgency and importance affecting the mission. The general history of the mission embodied in this report describes in some detail the circumstances which guided my line of action throughout our sojourn in the country and journeys across Baluchistan. I have had to write this report somewhat hurriedly and under difficulties, and regret any shortcomings. I have not now the leisure necessary to properly compile the mass of intelligence work anent resources, routes, and other important matters col lected; these will, at a more fitting occasion, be incorporated with the Gazetteers and Route-books of Seistan, Baluchistan and Afghanistan.2 I beg to express my thanks to the Government of India for the honour they have conferred on me by selecting me for such an important duty, and I hope I have discharged the functions of the office in a manner to justify the confidence reposed in me. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, G. W. BRAZIER-CREAGH, Surgeon-Major, A.M'S* \REPORT ON THE MISSION TO SEISTAN, 189T. CHAPTER I. GENERAL ACCOUNT OF JOURNEY ACROSS THE BALUCHISTAN DESERT. I left Quetta on tbe 6th April 1897 in accordance with telegraphic instructions from the Foreign Department directing me to reach Seistan with the utmost expedition. My party and escort included Hospital Assistant Abas Ali, Surveyor Asgar Ali Beg, K.B., Slier Ali, clerk, Daffadars Muhammad Azim Khan and Ghulam Haidar with 12 sowars of the Sind Horse, Jamadar Jhanda Khan, with 15 Rustomzai Baluch levies, mounted on trotting camels, Sowar Mir Afghan, 9th Bengal Lancers (personal orderly), four servants, and seven syces. We reached Nushki, 93 miles, on the 9th April. Here I was forced to halt one day, the local Sardars having intimated their desire to come in and salaam to me, as also to report a recent raid that had been committed, the result of a long-standing inter-feudal quarrel between the Rakhshani and Zagar Mangal tribes. Next morning I held a darbar, at which were present Sardar Muhammad Ali Khan, Zagar Mangal, and his cousin Mir Mehrulla Khan, Bakhtiar Khan and his brother Mir Hasil Khan, Yar Muhammad, Jam Beg, Jamal Din, Chief, and his brother Kaim Khan, with several of their respective followers. From the reports that reached me I learnt that Muhammad Ali Khan and Mehrulla, who had been entrusted with the charge of the passing kafilas by the Assistant Political Agent, Chagai, were the chief offenders. As far as I could glean, local affairs appeared to be by no means in a satisfactory condition, and undoubtedly trouble seemed brewing ; what subse quently followed bore out this conviction : Mir Mehrulla and his gang caused considerable trouble ; the Nushki thana was burnt down, and a raid made at Mastung by Jaffir Khan. Happily, owing to the prompt and energetic action of Mr. Barnes, Agent to the Governor-General, Baluchistan, more serious trouble was frustrated. Five long hot marches brought us to Dalbandin, 122 miles, on the 15th April. From here two routes were open to me, a northern one, via Ismail, Merai, Jhuli, Manzil and Amir Chah, and a southern vid Asa, Zeh, Isa-Tahir, Mash-Kiga, and Amalaf. The latter route, though somewhat longer, was chosen, as being the least known, and consequently the more important to reconnoitre. Mr. Barnes, too, recognizing the necessity of finding out the best routes and having a complete reconnaissance and survey of those best suited for the development of our commercial interests along this sphere, requested me to proceed by this little known route, unless some unforeseen obstacles arose to prevent my completing the reconnaissance.2 Leaving Dalbaudin on the 17th April, having halted a day to hire some extra camels to carry \tfh,ter before facing the desert, we reached Kundi, 131 miles, without mishap, on the 22nd April. This the first section of the route was over a weird, arid and barren stretch of sandy desert, unrelieved by a single interesting feature, nothing but a vast expanse of sandy plain and saltings, stretching away on all sides, apparently without limit till lost in yellow fiery haze and mirage. It can be dismissed in very few words, having no advantages whatever, strategical or otherwise, to recommend it. At Kundi I was delayed two days, being disappointed in the return of Zangi (guide)- whom I had sent to convey a letter to Lieutenant Webb-Ware at Amir Chah. Zangi knew the country well and had arranged to guide us across the Dasht-i-Quran and through the Amalaf hills. His detention was a source of considerable anxiety to me, as I had to fall back on the not too reliable guidance of a young Baluch camel-man in my caravan, who had only once travelled the route some five years back. Pushing forward from Kundi on the 24th April we reached Kirtaka, 131 miles, on the 28th April, having halted one day to explore the Amalaf range. This the second section of the route is over a much better line, being hard pat most of the way; water, too, is procurable at reasonable intervals and is of better quality than that met with on the first section of the route. On the road to-day (28th April 1897) 1 was met by a caravan of merchants on their way back to Quetta. They informed me that on arrival at the Seistan frontier they were stopped and turned back by the Persian officials. No apparent reason was given for this step, and they further stated that the people of the country made no secret of the fact that the Persian officials were only acting up to the orders of the Russian Government, who had caused the routes to be closed by agreement with His Majesty the Shah-in-Shah. The merchants appeared to be delighted to meet a representative of the British Sirkar, and at once appealed to me to help them in the matter. They were already sadly dejected and disheartened at the loss they had sus tained at having to retrace their steps, after undergoing great hardships in the course of their long desert journey from Peshin to Seistan, detention there some days, and now the return journey before them in this great heat. The situation appeared to me to be a very serious one. There was no doubt that any delay to remedy such substantial grievances would have the effect of shaking the confidence of the people in the power of the British Sirkar, more particularly at a time like the present, when the country was in a not too settled state along this our newly acquired territory, so recently ceded us by the Indo-Afghan Boundary Commission of 1895-96. Fully realising the importance of the matter, I wrote out a telegram (in cypher) there and then, which I despatched by an urgent messenger back their legitimate grievances and bring pressure to bear on the Persian authorities, which I had no doubt would induce them to change their line of action. However, my efforts in this respect were fruitless, the merchants refused to return and proceeded on their way. A few months afterwards when news reached Seistan (through Sardar Purdil Khan, who had arrived from Tabas) that all restrictions as to trade and routes were removed, I had reason to con gratulate myself on the result of my prompt action in despatching the tele gram, for I immediately saw that Government had accepted my advice in the matter and that action had been taken at Tehran. In a few days, when letters had passed between the Deputy Sartip and myself and I had succeeded in persuading him to issue orders re-opening the routes in accordance with the instructions from his father, which I knew he had received (but was concealing), the people both in Seistan and over the to Quetta over the 480 miles of desert was to turn back with me, and that I would personally make an enquiry into/ 3 Helmand in Afghan territory were loud in praise of the British Sirkar, as it flew like u wild fire round the country that the Sirkar Angrez had caused the routes to be re-opened.* Starting again next morning we zig-zagged along the rugged, boulder- strewn skirts of the hills, crossing numerous broad scours, the outlets of the drainage from the Mirjapra, Kacha, and Lar ranges. Our frontier post Robat, 47a miles, was reached on 30th April. The intervening distance between Quetta and the Persian frontier, a dis tance of 527J miles, was accomplished in 24 days, including five days* halt, averaging 22 miles per day or 27f miles per marching day. This, too, over exceptionally bad going for the greater part of the iourney, and in excessive heat, with indifferent, not to say bad, water at long intervals, is a test of what our native cavalry and heavily-laden camel corps can do when put to the pinch. The length of the marches varied, all distances from 12 to 43 miles being covered each day, and I had not a sore-hack amongst the animals on reaching Seistan. Letters awaited me here from the Sartip, Deputy Governor, and from Colonel Yate, Her Britannic Majesty’s Consulate-General, Meshed, with a copy of the order issued by the Governor-General of Khorasan to the Hash- mut-ul-Mulk, directing him to receive me with all honours and render me all the assistance that I may require during my stay in Seistan, etc., etc. The condition of the horses and transport on the completion of this exceedingly hot and rapid march necessitated a rest. Consequently a halt of a few days was made at Robat. During this period I was able to make a complete reconnaissance survey of the surrounding hills and valleys, which are of considerable strategic importance affecting our trade routes and future policy towards Seistan. Leaving Robat again on 6th May, at 7 miles we nicked in with, and followed along the main kafila route from Jalk and Sarhad to Seistan and Western Afghanistan, by no means a well supplied route in the all important matter of water, which is only met with at long stretches. We reached Seistan, 94 miles, on the 9th May. This latter part of the iourney to us appeared a regular high-way, after the lonely deserts and plains we had crossed ; travellers and traders are free to come and go unquestioned, no restrictions being imposed on them similar to those affecting our Seistan- Quetta routes, instituted by the adverse influence of the Moscovite under the cloak of plague. Incidents ' en rowte.”—The journey at this season of the year, as majf be supposed, was intensely hot, added to which was a scarcity of water, which moreover was neither suitable nor palatable for equines, much less humanes. Most of the old wells had either fallen in or had been filled in by sand drifts • the majority of them had been fouled beyond description by years of foecal * and other matter which, saturating the ground in the vicinity of the wells, had percolated through, thus rendering the water positively dangerous for drinking purposes. Though little if at all inhabited excepting by a few wild nomads, this m former days was a much frequented route, but owing to the swZmwj of Sir Nauroz Khan and the predatory proclivities of the Reki and Dawani bad- mashes it fell into disfavour.! Jalk riots —Two marches from Nushki we camped by a kafila from Jalk (16 stages vid Reg-i-Wakab) en route for Nushki; they informed me of a serious disturbance in the Jalk district. It would appear from their information the tribes are up in arms and resent the oppression of Mir Abdulla Khan, Governor. • Vide Appendix A, letter No. 5, dated 14th July 1897, paragraphs 41 and 42, also letter No. 10, dated 28th August 1897, paragraph 8.—B.C. „ 11 shall again refer to this section of the route. Strategically it is a much better line of advance than that by Amir Cbab.—» B.O. ^ cj4 It is reported that the Sartip of Bampur (my old friend Zain-ul- Abidin) had to proceed with a small force to quell the riot, but the embers are still smouldering and further trouble seems threatening. Flight of locusts .—On the 20th April we encountered a flight of locusts on the Assa Keg desert, which not only covered the ground, but stretched away some 5 miles in a south-westerly direction. J They are now about to hatch, and on the completion of this interesting physiological process will no doubt migrate and do considerable damage. Famine effects.—The few nomad shepherds and camel-men met alon^ this desolate and sparsely inhabited route complained bitterly of famine and craved for flour or bread; their condition is very pitiable. They live chieflv on a tuber which grows in the sand dunes, of which there are two species, one resembling a carrot in consistency and beet-root in colour, the other somewhat resembles a mangel-wurzel, but is of a chocolate hue. This unappetising dietary, though nourishing as it undoubtedly must be, is eaten raw, occasion ally being varied by a roast or boil, when it is then mixed with’camels’ or goats’ milk. Locusts, of which there are now plenty and to spare, largely help to allay the pangs of hunger and swell the scanty pot. Fhe Damini and Ferso^JBctluch Fouiidavy .—There exist considerable dis satisfaction and disappointment in Damini circles that they had not been included amongst the British subjects. Had the Beiso-Baluch boundary followed a more westerly alignment, say along the course of the Mirjawa river, or better still further west along the crest of Koh-i-Safed, a masterly political stroke would have been effected for the well-being and prestige of the Sirkar Angrez. Such a boundary line, while securing us a well-defined, natural and strategic frontier, would have brought within our sphere of influence a yagi tribe, \v°ho have for years inwardly despised and hated the Kagars, defied their yoke, and fervently prayed to become allies of the Daulat Angrez. The ignorance and lack of interest on the part of the Persian officials—in the persons of the local Governor Asadullah Khan and the Birman Farmai in this remote corner—were very prominently brought home to Lieutenant P. M Sykes and myself during our tour through Persian Baluchistan in 1893 and 1891. From experience gained during the above tour,* information to hand, when a guest of the Governor Asadullah Khan at Khwash, the capital of Sarhad,’ supplemented by more recent information given me by the chief of the Damini and neighbouring tribes, I have no hesitation in asserting my belief that the Persian authorities would welcome any relief which would rid them of these troublesome and yagi subjects, of whom they stand in great dread. Their Sardar, Jahund Khan, does pretty much what he likes, raids the country, and refuses to pay maliyat, retiring when hard pressed to the fastness of Safed Koh, Mirjawa, and Amalaf ranges. He owes allegiance to none but Sardar Purdil Khan, head of the Sarhandi tribe, of whom the Damini are a sub-section, f Khwash, the capital of Sarhad, on which now stands the new frontier fort (Persian), is the lawful territory of the Sarbandis of Seistan, the annexation of which by the Kagars has been the cause of the bitter hatred engendered against them by Jahund Khan and his followers who for eighteen generations 0 have been independent. Colonel Bell, V.C., in the report referred to at foot,J: sounded “ the trumpet note of warning ” on this and many other important points affecting our pres tige and political relations in these remote parts, pointing out succinctly the necessary steps to be followed re boundary demarcations, etc., etc. * J ide my report ' A Reconnaissance through Persian Baluchistan and Eastern Persia, 1893-94 ” nacrp. and 79.—B.C. ’ pa ° es fin proof of which I submit a letter from Jahund Khan to Sardar Purdil Khan, re raids—vide Appendix B» No. 9.—B. C. * ^ Notes on a Journey from Quetta to Trebizond, page 30, etc.—B. C.5 A perusal of the works* noted, and the adoption of a line of policy on so sound a basis, might have served the members of the Perso-Baluch Boundary Commission, and prevented the adoption of so rapid a system of demarcation as drawing a boundary line across a section of country, of which rather more than one-half, and that the most important half, had not previously been even provisionally surveyed or reconnoitred to test the accuracy of details and learn the local condition of affairs. The award of the Great King Solomon repeated. —As in the case of the “ toe ”of land stretching between Harmak and the Helmand, another supposed insignificant tract of country ceded to Afghanistan, so here again the award of the Great King Solomon ^ seems to have been executed.! The very alphabet of common prudence would suggest that some geo graphical and other knowledge might have been of service in this boundary delimitation, nor is it quite clear what was “all the special information that was required which Lieutenant P. M. Sykes brought w r ith him trom Kerman. It certainly does not appear to have served as a reliable guide to those entrusted with the execution of the Perso-Baluch boundary, nor turned for the benefit of the Empire, “ to such excellent account in the settlement of these most import ant outstanding frontier claims’* as Colonel Holdich would have us believe.^ The weakness of this boundary line becomes all the^ more apparent as we leave Itobat and approach Wavaila nala, in which is situated one of the most notable and much frequented shrines all over British and Persian Baluchistan, viz., Ziarat Malik Siah. A little strategy and finesse with Asadullah Khan and Colonel Suliman “ on whom the Persian Commissioner w r as wholly dependent, ” would have obtained for us a considerable slice of important territory west of the proposed Tehran line, or even the entire important valley of Mirjawa. That we did not secure this tract of country is a great pity; from the infinitesimal Persian interest in the locality and inhabitants, as also a personal knowledge of Asad ullah Khan and Colonel Suliman, I have every reason for believing they would have offered feeble if any opposition had this point been pressed. Advantages lost. —Such a concession amongst others would have secured to us a suitable site for military purposes, as well as a commanding position for our frontier post in the vicinity of Ziarat Malik Siah, on the impoitant avenue to Seistan, instead of having it as now in an utterly useless position at Sar Bobat, several miles outside the area of the main trade routes. Advantages of Mirjawa. —Mirjawa shares with Ladis a reputation for healthiness and fertility, has a full and plentiful flow of perennial water uith a considerable amount of arable land and good pastuiage. With the Daminis under our sphere of influence, who have always evinced a friendly feeling towards the Sirkar Angrez, and situated as they are on the fringe of our main kafila route, we would be in a position to once and for all check the depredations and lawlessness of this petty tribe, which the Persians plead inability to do, and, with the assistance of theii influential Saidai, guaid our newlv-acquired frontier routes (both on the Afghan and Persian side) from further raids, particularly the long unprotected section of this route between Robat and Amir Chah, where most of the raids aie peipetiated.§ Action and result of Persian authorities in closing the routes.—As report ed in my secret telegraphic despatch from Kirtaka, under date 2Sth Apiil 1897, the unjustifiable action of the Persian authorities (at instigation of Russia) in closing the Quetta-Seistan trade routes by refusing permission to all British traders to enter the country caused most disheartening effects, not to mention serious losses to those whose enterprise had prompted them to venture by these newly-acquired routes. * Wanderings in Baluchistan, Appendix B, pages 312 and 313.—B.C, ■j - Vide Journey from Quetta to Trebizond, page 7 of Preface.

They escaped with their lives, but not before Barki Dad had been severely wounded and their animals and property all looted. Vz 7 CHAPTER II. GENERAL HISTORY OF THE MISSION AND CONDITION OF AFFAIRS IN SEISTAN. Line of procedure on arrival in Seistan .—From information received en route I judged it politic before entering the capital to visit several large towns en passant and gather any local information of importance to guide my line of procedure, as my orders at the outset were somewhat ambiguous. I had every reason to congratulate myself on this subsequently, for I picked up much of a secret and political nature which enabled me to steer clear of the innumerable quick-sands of Russo-Persian intrigue, and thus avoid falling under the fostering care of Russian spies who unfortunately surrounded Lieutenant Webb-Ware during his flying visit before my arrival.* Arrival of the Mission at the Capital. —We reached Nasratabad on the 14th May and were duly received with the customary Persian eclat. Our entry was so timed as to have all interchange of visits, etc., with the Persian officials over before the arrival of the Russian officers, who, I heard, were expected in a few days. In the afternoon of the day of our arrival the Deputy Sartip, accompanied by a large suite of officers, attendants, and sowars, paid me a visit, and were duly received by my escort with honour and salutes which not a little surprised and pleased them. Visit of the Deputy Sartip and Pillars of State .—After the usual oreetings and service of tea and kaliun, I explained to him the nature of my visit (of which he had been previously apprised by his father, the Governor or Tabas and Seistan) and sought his cordial co-operation and assistance m the necessary steps to be taken to guard against the risk of the importation of plague into his country. Though apparently under considerable restraint, both in their manner and utterance, there was no concealing the evident pleasure our presence alforded them all, and every assurance was given me by the Deputy Sartip of his desire to comply with my request and the orders he received from his father on this head, and for our treatment during our stay in the country. Soon after their departure a Khassadar arrived from the Deputy Sartip to find out our daily requirements for the number of men and animals ; accom modation was also offered us in the visitors' caravansarai by the Bagh. , This I courteously declined, as the situation and surroundings were very unfavourable for occupation by my party. One Muhammad Akram Khan and his brother, Russian spies, were very kindly told off with express orders to look after our camp and assist me in every way. I declined de bon grace their assistance, pointing out that I ^ had ample attendants of my own. As soon as all had withdrawn, I posted sentries and once and for all prevented strangers visiting our camp surreptitiously. Later on, a guard of eight men was supplied. To these I allotted a site at some distance, as I could not well send them back, though there could be no doubt with what kindly solicitous thoughtfulness they had been selected tor us. In the evening a large consignment of grain, cooked rations, with a varied assortment of sweetmeats, tea, sugar, ghee, fruit, etc., were sent as mamanu and in return I sent a gold lungi, a valuable watch, a pair of binoculars, a gold brooch (for the Deputy Sartip’s mother), and an assortment ot Lnglish stores, sweets, chocolates, biscuits, etc., all of which I was informed weve much appreciated and gave the recipients some surprise as well as the natural oriental pleasure. * It is only fair to point out that this could hardly have been avoided, as that officer did not ™?®' ve considerable time after his departure from the country the confidential orders notifying Russian doing which had been forwarded to him,—li. C.« and 0tberS Wer6 mCt 0n tbG 0Ut ' ard aDd retu ™ proceeding on pilgrimage to 8 Return visit and reception-Sext morning I paid my return visit, and long before the hour appointed there was quite a stir within the fort and emissaries informed us preparations were being made for our reception. ’ On our approach the garrison manned the front wall of the fort, lined the roadway and gates, and accompanied by an escort of irregular cavalry which had been sent to meet us preceded by a band (playing a national hymn) we approached the citadel. On dismounting at the Darbar Hall, midst much bowin' and scraping, I was ushered into the presence of the Deputy Sartip who w- s surrounded by the Pillars of State, officers, soldiers, and attendants^ a pompous and remarkable collection of very ill-clad and uncleanly people as unmistak- ably demonstrated in such weather. We conversed for some considerable time on various subiects but it was very evident mine host was ill at ease, and though apparently desirous to frankly reply to my questions, the restraining signs and influence of those around prevented his doing so; conversation inconsequence was at times Sartip and eVaS1Ve answers S-n for and put into the mouth of the Deputy At this as well as all subsequent public interviews I avoided all reference to probe C m™feeflno-s ^ GCtm ^ ^ alt h° u Dh repeated attempts were made i 0a e * quirin / reas ? a of an &lt;* affecting surprise at British merchants (with letters and pass to Her Britannic Majesty’s Consulate-General, Meshed) bein°&gt; prevented from entering the country and proceeding further on their iournev 5 and other restrictions imposed on kafilas from Nushki and Chagai without anv evidence of plague or illness which did not affect kafilas from Jalk, Sarhad or Bam-jNarmashir, who were free to come and go unmolested, I was informed that a11 o^ers on the subject directly emanated from His Highness the Shah, and that they (officials) had simply to comply with the royal mandate imposed on them, that as far as they were personally concerned everyone in the country much regretted the closure of the routes, as it stopped all their trade and the surplus gram would rot.” ’ I was even naively asked why the Sirkar Angrez permitted it, a si^nifi* cant question, as everyone knew it was the Russians who had caused the routes to be closed on account of commercial jealousy, and the recent boundary lines by which the Butish Snkar was able to have her frontier post at Robat so near Jr ersia. Before taking my leave I fully explained all the measures that the Indian Government had successfully taken to protect her Muhammadan and other subjects, and to prevent epidemic disease of all sorts spreading, not onlv with in her own gates and portals, but on the channels and high-roads leadin- to and from other neighbouring countries, at the same time expatiating on the lam- amount (crores of rupees) annually spent by the British Government to protect and assist the millions of pilgrims who proceed to Mecca, Karbalai, Meshed Hardwnr and other notable places of pilgrimage, clearly pointing out the’ infinitesimal possibility of plague reaching either Persian Baluchistan!Seistan or Afghanistan, and at the same time making a strong point of the 'reat hard ships and loss such a step (closure of routes) caused their Indian co-religionists who were now m trying heat crossing the deserts to complete a piWima-'p, to “Meshed the Sacred,”* and others for trade purposes. Plumage to •x, A11 . , thl ! 14 p ! a!al , y “Ot'ceable was a great surprise, but was received with evident satisfaction by all present. At the outset all my endeavours to persuade the Deputy Governor to impose quarantine and let all traders, pilgrims, etc., proceed onwards or enter the country alter a reasonable detention on the frontier, were treated with opposition ; each appeal met with the same reply “ he had no power to do so. His Highness the Shah having issued orders to close the routes.” When all efforts failed, I made a vigorous religious appeal to theMujtahid (High Priest),9 ostensibly on behalf of the poor Shiah pilgrims, ana the hardships a long deten tion or return would cause them; this had the desired effect the High Priest supported my representations, and all objections on the part of officials were over- ridden. . I would here point out that orders anent the re-opening of the Se.stan- Ttflluohistan routes were only received by me on the 22nd July 1897 (ptr Colonel Yate’s letter, Meshed, dated 4 th June 1897 ), over a month after the departure of the Russian Medical Officer and over wo months after my arrival in the country. It will therefore be seen I was working all this time completely n e dark, w y hich required considerable tact and fine.se._ At an interview with the Deputy Sartip on the 18th July 1897, be denied having received any orders about the routes up to date. Now I knew for a fact Sardar Purdil Khan had given them to him some days previously, as also a despatch for me from Colonel Yate with a copv of the same orders. The latter were sent me on the 22nd July, and doubtless would have been detained longer had I not received secret intelligence from the Sardar of their delivery at iSasratabad. Here we have an illustration that the usual Persian system of diplomacy was being pursued. ^ The reins of Local Government .—“Mir MahsumKhan, Deputy bartip, the only legitimate son of Sartip Ali AUbar Khan, Governor of labas and Seistan, with his mother, rule Seistan in the father s mteiest. He is but a boy and puppet in the hands of staid and crafty officials who lean more towards the Birjand than Tabas rule, and are one and all recipients of Russian pay and favours. The Lady Ah Akbar, mother and co ruler with the Deputy Sartip, is a sister of Sirdar “ Syed Khan, Chief of Naroi Raluch (a large clan), a man of enlightened views and having considerable influence and property. , . A . . . .. , The “ most beautiful ” mother of the Sartip, as she is styled, is considered to be a clever, intelligent and well-educated woman, and judging by the letter in Annendix A,* we might truly style her sexn fcemma tiro ingemo. She is reported to have been present (behind the purda) at all interviews and visits tZt I paid to her son, as well as to have dictated the diplomatic letters which passed between us when attempts were made to drive us out of the country by the crafty Pillars of State, at the instigation of Russian Agents. T&gt; a i„n n n*hin of Biriond with Tabas and Seistan rule—'Stir Alum Khan Urn fTther of the Governors of Birjand and Tabas and Seistan, had three wives by whom he had three sons, wz..— (1) Ali Akliar Khan (the eldest son), Hashmat-ul-Mulk. (2) Ismail Khan (second son), Showkat-ul-Mulk. (3) Ibrahim Khan (third aon), Amir Punj, Ghain Troops. During Mir Alum Khan’s life he deputed the eldest son as Deputy Governor of Seistan when he was himself at Birjand. The second son was appointed Amir Punj in command of the Ghain forces with the rank of Sartip under his father. As Mir Alum breathed his last (in 1891), he decided that “ he who had s •o+fn mnst keen it,” and “he who had always been at Birjand must have rTw’ tt vounger (Ismail Khan) who was a minor, t he deputed to the charge of Showkat-ul-Mulk, the elder brother. ' a r er&gt;ort of the dying man’s wishes was accordingly submitted to His Highness the Shah, and soon after his death sanction in accordance with the above arrangement was duly granted by letters patent. *11 Akbar Khan bad reason for believing undue influence had been brought to bear on his father during his (Ali Akbar’s) absence as Governor of Seistan and not being satisfied with the hereditary distribution by which all Ghain province was left to his younger brother, with whom in earlier days he W not been on -ood terms, immediately (on the death of his father) proceeded to Tehran to set forth his claim to the Governorship of Gham. * Vide Appendix A, Diary No. 5. paragraph 43, dated 14th July 1697. t About the same age as the Deputy Sartip, Seistau.—B. C. 1068 F. D. -B.C.'UPEfMZ m, 10 At first, on arrival at Tehran, he was informed that the orders could not be cancelled or interfered with, but after a few days and by judicious present ation of peshkhish at court, it was arranged that he should have the Govern orship of Tabas with permission to depute his son Mir Mahsum Khan as Deputy Sartip of Seistan. This appointment, to Ali Akbar, was a great success after his first failure, and a distinct gain over his brother, whose opposition was directed dead against him (Ali Akhar) regarding the appointment. He returned from the capital happy and pleased with his success and the honours that had been conferred on him during his visit. The appointment of Ali Akbar to Tabas and his son to Seistan was a jar to the feelings of Ismail Khan, who had set his heart on other arrangements, and as counter to his young nephew Mir Mahsum being appointed Deputy Sartip of Seistan, he got their younger brother Muhammad Ibrahim Khan (minor) appointed Sartip of the Ghain forces under himself. Muhammad Ibrahim Khan is the heir-apparent to the Governorship of Ghain, as his elder brother (Ismail Khan, Showkat-ul-Mulk) has no sons. As Mahsum Khan was a minor, his mother, being an exceptionally clever woman, was put in charge of him, and her brother Sardar Syed Khan, Naori Baluch, was also deputed to assist them in the administration of Seistan. Such was the arrangement made by Ali Akbar in 1891 before he proceeded to Tabas to take up his new appointment as Governor there. JBirjatidi fy Co.'s meddling. —All went well for some time in Seistan under Syed Khan’s stewardship till Russian and Birjand influence began to work hand in hand, so much so that Ismail Khan, who is Amir Punj and responsible for the garrison of Seistan, sought a means of meddling in affairs under the guise of Amir Punj. The natural rivalry between co-wives of Ali Akbar Khan has led the mother to believe that with her husband—who has not seen her for some years—her son, the Deputy Sartip, is not the favourite son, in consequence of which she plays into the hands of the uncle Ismail Khan and the Naib-ul- Hakumat. Par he it from me to cast one suspicion of a blot on the character of even a Persian lady, but “ Mother Grundy ’* makes free use of this lady’s name, coupling it with that of the Naih-ul-Hakurnat. Syed Khan (her brother) himself told me in conversation to what extent he was annoyed with his sister and the Naib, and that Ali Akbar was doubtful of his wife’s bond tides in the administration of Seistan.* A plot was hatched to get rid of Syed Khan, some Parsiban tribes were bribed to prefer claims against him, the result being the appointment of a Ghaini (in Russian pay) in the person of Ali Yar Khan Naib-ul-Hakumat. There is no secrecy about the enmity (fermented by Russian intrigue) existing between the brothers, Ali Akbar and Ismail Khan, for years. The latter is considered to be jealous in all matters of the former, and seeks to do him injury. The following qualities are attributed to these brothers :—Ali Akbar Khan is considered an “ able but blood-thirsty man,” Ismail Khan “ an avaricious and unjust one.” The inhabitants of Seistan, though very discontented, are more partial to Ali Akbar and resent the interference of the brother in local affairs, whereas the officials and garrison who are mostly inhabitants of Ghain naturally look on Ismail Khan, their own Governor, as the all powerful being, so it is a case of “ pull devil, pull baker.” Progressive policy of Russia, her agents and their doings. —I was bv no means surprised on arrival in Seistan to find what ascendancy the Russians had gained in the country, for during my former tour throughout South- Eastern Persia, and while at Kerman (the most important trade centre south * My informant was well up in Seistan scandal, of irhich he had an inexhaustible store, some hardly fitted for ears polite.—B. C.11 of Meshed), I had heard much of Russian designs and policy, particularly affecting the little Seistan oasis. For the past four years since the visit of Lieutenant the Honourable H. D. Napier, Russian activity has been very manifest, as will be seen from what follows; this activity too is not limited to Seistan, but extends all along the Perso-Afghan frontier up to Meshed, news-writers and agents being established at all the important trade centres, viz., Neh, Birjand, Tabas, Khaf, and Turbat-i-H aidari. Their unjustifiable action in co-operation with the Tehran Court in having the Perso-Afghan-Baluch routes closed “ under the mantle of plague,” was a mere subterfuge, a blow aimed at choking in it infancy our Indian trade on this side or the re-opening of the old Khorasan-Sind routes, and our endeavour to resuscitate a large trade which at one time actively prevailed with India, and had only died out consequent on the hostile tariffs in Russian Central Asia and Afghanistan. Sanitary posts and dak arrangements. —Amongst a community who were perfectly apathetic as far as plague was concerned, I saw at the outset how hopeless it would be to rely on any official assistance, either for the establish ment of posts of observation or precautionary measures, and therefore deter mined to act in this matter independently. My surmise on this head was confirmed by the expression of a leading Baluch Sardar (with British sym pathies) who paid me a secret visit a few days after arrival, viz., “ the very walls have ears, Sahib, and you dare not trust anyone.” My first step was to secure the assistance of a reliable Baluch Sardar and Mulla, and in conjunction with them I established a sanitary post of inspec tion under my own sowars at Girdi (half way between Seistan and Robat), at Killah-i-Nao, and Daulatabad, two important entrepdts on the southern borders of Seistan. By this arrangement I was, metaphorically speaking, “ killing two birds,” etc., etc., as it ensured the safe and prompt transmission of my despatches across the intervening desert to our frontier post at Robat. Persian doctor's visit to Nasratabad. —On the day following Lieutenant Webb-Ware’s departure from Seistan, a Persian doctor, named Abdul Rahim Khan (said to have been trained in the Paris Medical Schools), arrived from Tehran via Meshed at Nasratabad and stayed a few days. At first it had been arranged that this doctor should accompany some Russian officers from Meshed, but the latter not having reached Meshed in time, the former came on alone. He was reported to have been very pompous while at the capital and to have bullied the authorities for permitting English officers and men to come into the country. It was stated he was in Russian pay and had sent a lot of exaggerated reports about the ravages of plague in Quetta and Kandahar, as also about the magnitude of Lieutenant Webb-Ware’s expedition and the number of men be had brought across the desert. It afterwards transpired that in consequence of the Russian Legation having got wind that an English army surgeon was deputed to Seistan, and on the representations of Her Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’ Affaires at Tehran, anent escort, etc., their tactics were altered, and a Russian medical officer was ordered to visit the country in the place of Russian military officers who at first were deputed to assist the Persians in the carrying out of quarantine measures. These Russian officers subsequently came to Birjand, where they remained some considerable time, during and after the stay of the Russian medical officer in Seistan. In addition to the adverse influence exerted by the Naib-ul-Hakumat as previously pointed out, one Mirza Muhammad Rahim Khan, otherwise known as “ Khan Meshedi,” has for the past three years been, without any secrecy, appointed news-writer in Seistan. In 1896, he was fined 50 krans by the Peputy Sartip for a rape case committed by him in Hussainabad; having paid b 212 the fine he left the town for some time and visited Meshed, returning with a letter from the Russian Consul General, Meshed, stating he was a Government official and was not to be interfered with, whereon the fine was remitted. He also had authority from the Russian Consulate at Meshed to purchase a site for a house, and to manage to build it as quietly and speedily as possible without giving rise to suspicion. Construction of Russian Consulate JResidency .—Two acres of ground were allotted at a nominal ground-rent of Rs. 60 and the building started in November 1896 ; consequent on inclement weather, the work was temporarily suspended in December, but re-commenced in January 1897, and was completed for occupation in March for some Russian officers who were to come there. The expenditure up to date exceeds Rs. 2,000, but it was reported the Russian Government purpose to extend the buildings, adding additional stabling and out-offices, which will come up to considerably more. Russian Officer's visit .—On the 8th May, Docteur Bolestav Milascheoski, Officer du Corps de Medicin, accompanied by an escort of eight cossacks, arrived at Nasratabad. He received the same hospitality and attention as had been given to us. Next morning I received a visit from the Naib-ul-Hakumat who made profuse apologies for not being able to visit me earlier owing to indisposition— a polite^ evasion of truth, as I knew for a fact, that accompanied by the news*writer, he had left Nasratabad the day previous to my arrival in order to meet the Russian officers three marches out. The object of his visit was ostensibly to find out my views and learn if I purposed visiting the officer. The Persians, in common with all Asiatics, are no whit different to Westerns in their notions and reverence for precedence, rank, etc., and from feelers thrown out it required no magician’s wand to reveal the fact that I, as first comer, was expected to pay the first official visit. Knowing how r much, in a matter of precedence, was at stake in the eyes of all the country, I affected great surprise at the presence of a Russian officer, remarking “ I could not understand an officer of another power coming into a zone of which I had been placed in medical charge of by joint agreement of the Persian and my Government, more particularly as I was given to under stand that the officer was a confrere, and such was contrary to the spirit of professional etiquette without first having apprised me of his intended visit.” However, I begged the Naib to convey my respects, and say that if any representative of the Czar had come into the country, it would afford me the greatest pleasure to receive him. That evening I received a courteous message from the officer, requesting me to appoint an hour that he might call, which was duly done. On the 20th May the Russian officer paid me an official visit, and all preparations had been previously made to receive him with full honours. . He remained two hours; the orders and views {re plague) of our respec tive Governments formed the chief subject of conversation. Next day I paid my return visit, and was not a little surprised when ushered into a large and pretentious house (in Ilussainabad) which had un doubtedly been constructed with some ulterior purpose than that which it was supposed to be. It was easily seen the architecture and surroundings had been designed with a view to other than Persian occupation, and the Russian medical officer and his party were cosily housed during their stay, much to the envy of his English confrere and party who sweltered in the narrow limits of field service tents. The Russian officer remained 21 days in the country, throughout which time a mutual spirit of respect and good fellowship existed between us, and most favourable and cordial relations were cemented. Happily I was in a position to frequently entertain him, having with that object brought a quantity of English stores./ 13 I was so far fortunate in making him view matters in such a different light as not to send in his despatches a repetition of the exaggerated reports about the ravages of plague in Quetta and Kandahar which the Persian doctor had done. Bis being an officer and a gentleman of enlightened and advanced profes sional knowledge, made things easier, but he appeared to be hampered with secret orders. Prom what transpired there could be no doubt of the nature of his visit, and that he came with the express object of enhancing llussian prestige, to push Russian trade, decry and preach against British trade, prestige, etc , as also with a view of crossing the deserts south of Seistan and penetrating on our newly-acquired frontier by Malik Siah Koh. Ue made repeated suggestions and requests for permission to visit my posts and satisfy himself “ by order of his Government ” that all quarantine arrangements were satisfactory. In a friendly manner I protested, and informed him I could not tolerate any breach of professional etiquette or interference in any way with my duties, that the Government of India had given me a free hand in the matter of expenses, etc., etc., to make all the arrangements I considered necessary, which at great labour had been carried out. Russian Officer's tour .—During his stay the officer made a short tour along the villages in the south of Seistan {vide Despatch No. 3, dated 7th July^ 1897), and at one village he frightened the officials and inhabitants by threatening to have them punished for permitting traders to come into the country; during this tour he also preached and decried English politics, trade, and the quality of our goods. A fruitful source of seditious preaching was that the British Govern ment were now throwing the plague-stricken people alive into the seas at Bombay, Karachi, etc., and burning the houses and people affected. This widespread belief which was being circulated was a great source of political mischief, for the natural inference was that the British rule was a curse instead of a blessing to Muhammadans. I returned by the same route the Russian officer had travelled over and took a favourable opportunity of inviting him to dinner on return to Nasrat- abad. At this interview I told him of what I had heard, expressing astonish ment at his action, stating “ I did not think it compatible with the dignity of a professional office to adopt such a line, and possibly foment trouble between two powers ; that we were not there for political purpose, as far as my orders were laid down.” I requested an immediate discontinuance of his procedure, stating “ the Government of India, as far as I knew, had no desire to interfere in the politics or independence of her neighbouring countries so long as her interests were not interfered with, nor, on the other hand, did I think she would tolerate any other power adopting such a role.' furthermore, I pointed out the more rational and broad-minded view to keep in sight was that there could be no objection to English trade and goods having the same mart as Russian. To the credit of the Russian officer, be it said, he complied with my protests, or at least I concluded he did so, for no further complaints reached me, and up to the evening of his departure, we had almost daily exchanged friendly visits. He gave me his assurance on more than one occasion that he concurred with me in thinking that plague was most unlikely to come into the country, but that his Government would not be satisfied or believe in any representa tions to the contrary made by him until the epidemic had entirely disappeared from India. Be stated he would have to remain at Birjand for further orders, which he did for some months and subsequently for a further period at Turbat-i-Haidari, as several friendly letters passed between us from each place. The unfortunate contretemps reported in my Secret Despatch No. 3, dated 7th July 1897, had something to do with the hasty departure of the Russian14 officer from the country, for on his first arrival he came to stay for an indefinite period, he informed me. y Los* of the Russian Posts.—In the early part of June the Russian dftk Hu“ifn r party my Sly disa PI )eared &gt; which caus ed great anxiety in the (Mk recovered' 61 '’ &amp; Baluch ’ 00uI,i not be found and waa never traced or the Mission Postal arrangements.—In the face of such mishaps it is satis- actory to report that not a single hitch occurred in the transmission of all com munications during the absence of the mission, which goes to show the postal bv thfTolU LToffi::7rh 0r0 • ghly 1 cai ' ried out b y the dak ~rs employed , the political Officer, Chagai, and myself.

J hc .? rant of Rs ; 60° per month allotted by the Government of India for « taming communications with me enabled Lieutenant Webb-Ware to safeguard the line with extra sowars and to establish a few extra posts. Recommendations for maintenance of postal and other communications —T would here suggest that it would be well to consider a permanent“r e nt J this sum to enable Lieutenant Webb-Ware to keep up these very necessary posts and communications for the benefit of our traders and the advancement of this route, which, if neglected and not safeguarded, will do incalculable damage to British prestige and future trade prospects.

C. ' ~~ ' t ride Appendix A, letter No. 4, dated 30th June 1897, paragraph* 12-22.-B. C.15 as also to examine and map the extent of inundation and its effect at the delta of the Helmand. We traversed the entire country beyond the Rud-i-Parian, visiting all the villages and trade centres on the Afghan border which had not been accurately mapped or previously visited when in a condition of flood as at this period of the year. We worked up to Milak which we had visited as previously noted, when in May I had made a rapid tour to the Helmand to intercept the Russian medical officer and prevent his visiting some trade centres and inciting the people as he had done on the south.* We were beforehand again here, having managed to visit Milak and other villages —trans-Helmand—two days previous to his arrival on the Helmand bank at the only ferry opposite which our camp was pitched. On hearing I had lost a horse and nearly lost my life in swimming the river, then in high flood, he gave up the idea of crossing and returned to Nasratabad by the route we had come. ^Particulars of Russian Officers Tour .—I might point out that the Russian officer’s tour was a very short one, he had no tents, and put up in a house pre pared for him at a few of the villages by some satellites of the Deputy Governor who escorted him on his tour and who were by no means partial to exposure at this particular season of tbe year. On this tour we were for a few days the guest of Sardar Khan Jahan ot Saidak ; nothing could exceed this Sardar’s kindness and generosity, as also that of another hostess, the Bibi Qama, widow of the late Sardar Gul Muhammad of Pulgi.f I learnt through Sardar Khanjan Khan that there was no truth in the exaggerated reports the Persian officer had made about plasrue, and which the Russian officer subsequently reported as having broken out in Kandahar and Herat, etc. This Sardar w r as much interested in the political situation and the recent Indo-Afghan Boundary Commission ; he knew Sir Robert Sandeman well, having been at Kandahar and Quetta with him. He also took great interest in the possible re-opening by Government of the old karezes at Robat, Koh-i- Siah, Piran, Kirtaka, Amir Chah, etc. ; he informed me many of his tribe would be glad to domicile there if permission were granted him as their ancestors had formerly lived there. He also told me he went to Nasratabad during Lieutenant Webb-Ware’s visit when he heard an English Sahib had come into the country, but obstacles were put in his way and he could not pay his visit to the officer. He had heard how the Sahib had given lots of presents to the Sartip and some for the Sardars, which latter were not distributed ; how the officials in return had treated the officer so badly and kept him sitting fourteen days in Pain-Hussainabad awaiting camels, and had he (Khanjan Khan) only known it, he would have gladly sent him camels. He explained himself to his people who were sitting round at one of my visits, recapitulating with wonderful accuracy every stage on the route ; how that “ long before Russians could ever attempt to get into the country the British Sirkar’s troops could jump into Seistan.” He was well up in the Russian policy and ambitions with regard to Afghanistan and the acquisition of trade monopoly, as also her doings in Northern Persia. Adverse influence at work .—On the 29th June I had to make a rapid ride of 47 miles, my Daffadar having sent a special orderly to report that the officials had stopped all their supplies J and were inciting the people to drive them out of the country. For particulars vide Appendix A, letter No. 4, dated 30th June 1897, paragraphs 25-27. This unpleasant state of affairs was however smoothed over on letters passing between myself and the Deputy Sartip, but the “ snake was still in the * Vide Appendix A, letter No. 3, dated 7th July 1897, paragraph 3.—B.

J Notwithstanding the orders given by Persian officials not to sell supplies to our camp, large quantitiee were •muggled into camp by friendly Sardars, Mullas, and others.—B. C.16 srrass ” in the person of the news-writer and others, who in a few days after again hatched a much more serious plot to force us out of the country {vide Appendix A, letter No. 5, dated 14th July 1897, paragraphs 9—17). This fortunately came secretly to my notice by the kindly information of a friendly Mulla, as also the information that the Mullas had been summoned to a meeting by the officials in order to press them to preach to the people in their respective villages that to give supplies to the infidel and his people was against Muham madan laws. I was here again confronted with a serious state of affairs which, on mature consideration, seemed to me to require prompt action, and that any show of weakness on my part would undoubtedly be prejudicial to British prestige and interest. It Avas obviously extremely inadvisable to let time slip by, and it seemed to me the most effectual way to prevent either a surprise or further trouble Avas not to await further development of this plot, but to treat it boldly and theil like the nettle “ it would he found to have lost its sting,” so promptly saddling up, and accompanied by my Daffadar and a few sowars I rode into the village square at Kimak, summoned the Kadkhuda and his people, and informed them “ that I had heard of their intended plot, that now he and his badmashes could come when they liked, but that the first man we saw near camp I w’ould fire on him straight, and that the bloodshed would be at his door.” The threat had its effect, for we Avere unmolested and lived peaceably in the country for several months after that, notwithstanding further workings by the news-writer and his supporters. It is well to state here that before I took action I despatched a letter reporting the matter to the Sartip at Nasratabad, 22 miles from camp. Copies of the official communications are attached and form Appendix B of this report. Consequent on this outburst of hostility and opposition anent supplies, I moved my base camp from Killah-i-Nao to Kosha Pain, where Ave remained till our departure from the country ; here the local Sardars rendered us every assistance for the remainder of our stay. During an interval of quiescence here we were enabled to make large pur chases of grain and transport it across the desert to our Robat post, sufficient to last them during the winter season with a very large margin to cany us back on the return journey to Quetta. This step Avas a considerable saving to Government, as I purchased at very favourable rates {vide Appendix A, letter No. 10, dated 28th August 1897, paragraph 15), besides which it made our frontier post independent of Seistan officials and secure against boycott in the matter of supplies on my Avithdrawal from the country. The Agent to the Governor-General, Baluchistan, having since acted on the advice contained in my Despatch No, 1257-C., dated 13th July 1897, paragraph 14, has established supply depdts at Amir Chah, Dalbandin, etc., from which can be replenished further consignments to Robat, when the present supply is exhausted. I would point out arrangements should be made for laying in supplies through tribal agency along the Kanak, Nushki and Dalbandin, etc., route up to Robat, and special precautions taken to guard against the raiding of tribes Avest of Amalaf and Mirjawa ranges. If the Damini bogey were removed or Sardar Jahund Khan subsidised, there would no doubt be much less anxiety felt in future regarding the safety of this kafila route, but we can never be quite at our ease on this score till the Damini have been squared. Money having run short, I had occasion to despatch my apothecary, Abas Ali, under escort to Birjand on the 22nd August. Having supplied him with a trood outfit of medicine he was able to do much useful work w r hile detained 18 days in Birjand awaiting reply from Meshed, as well as to quietly feel the pulse 'of popular feeling {vide Appendix A, letter No. 10, dated 28th August 1897, paragraphs 4—8) ; the party were absent just a month, and their return was a great relief both in the matter of specie (which they had brought) as alsotheir own safety about which I had misgivings, consequent on the unsettled state of the country and the raids that were being perpetrated at the time. On the night of 25th August my post at Girdi situated on the desert between Seistan and Robat was attacked by a band of Sarhadi badmaahes; the men were severely beaten and one camel and other property looted, vide Appen dix A in Despatch No. 10, dated 28th August 1897, paragraph 16. This raid was duly reported to the officials with a request that the stolen property should be traced and returned.* I made this a legitimate excuse for another tour, and sot off in pursuit of the raiders of whose whereabouts I had got intelligence from a Baluch Sardar. Leaving Kosha Pain on 1st September we skirted the southern end of the Hamoon and after three intensely hot and long marches crossing the Shelag salt desert we were caught in a blinding saline blizzard which foiled all trace of the gang we were in pursuit of who were but one march ahead of us. They even tually entered the hills through the Baluchap nala where further pursuit was hopeless. Owing to delay caused by the blizzard which rendered all progress impos sible we ran out of water, but a forced march in a north-west direction through the hills on the west brought us to a spring ; this though highly impregnated with deleterious matter was a welcome find, for we had nolens volens to drink the filthy and intensely saline water in the southern end of the Hamoon the effects of which will not be forgotten by us for many a day. I spent the following three weeks in making a reconnaissance survey of the mountainous district on the west of Seistan. This district extending from Palang Koh on the north to Malik Siah Koh on the south—which has an important strategical bearing on the defence of Seistan—had not previously been explored ; I determined to survey and com plete this reconnaissance before the withdrawal of the Mission from Seistan, and it has now been completed. We reached camp Kosha Pain on 26th September to find the main party all well; they experienced no difficulties in the matter of supplies, Jaffar Khan, the headman of the village, having carried out the trust imposed in him during my absence, and willingly arranged for all the forage and supplies required. The incessant hard work and responsibilities—almost too much for one hand—super- added to other privations attendant on much rapid travelling in continuous and extreme heat for the past seven months, now began to tell—as may be sup posed. I was here laid prostrate for some ten days with low fever and dysentery as were others of the party. During these unhappy days I received repeated attentions and kind visits from the leading Sardars and Mullas. • Up to the departure of the Mission from Seistan the officials were unable to trace the offenders. In f nture settle ment of affairs and counter-claims it would be as well to bear this raid in mind, so that indemnity be claimed.—B. C.18 CHAPTER III. INFLUENTIAL TRIBAL CHIEFS WITH OTHER INTERESTING MATTER IMMEDIATELY CONNECTED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF SEISTAN. An erroneous idea prevails that the tribal chiefs in Seistan are of “no account and none occupy a higher position than that of village Kad Khuda.” This has not been my experience. I will mention some of the leadin'* Sardars, on whose assistance and influence are dependent the internal affairs and administration of the country, and to whom I know for a fact (having perused the letters) the Deputy Sartip and his father, the Governor of Tabas and Seistan, appeal to for a settlement of the frontier water distribution, tribal discontent] land revenues, raids and other matters concerning the well-being of this isolated little territory. To these Sardars is justly due a mead of praise from my pen, for without their assistance—at all times willingly rendered and against official opposition I would have had much difficulty. The clergy too of the country, I must not omit to state, rendered us valuable assistance, and by timely information—on more than one occasion prevented what might have developed into serious affairs. Influential Sardars of Seistan .—Sardar Purdil Khan, Sarbandi, son of Sardar Lutuf Ali Khan, is the most influential Sardar in Seistan, and the Sarbandi the largest tribe. This Sardar resides at Daulatabad in the sixth Nawar; he is a general adviser to the Deputy Sartip on matters of importance affectin'* tribal affairs, etc. He holds considerable sway not only over the Seistan Sarbandi and sub sections of this tribe, but his influence extends over the Damini and other small sub-tribes on the Sarhad plateaus. Purdil Khan is greatly respected, of undoubted ability, strength of character and, as his name implies, courageous. It is stated he did good service in the British cause with Sir Oliver St. John. This Sardar has lost his right arm, and the following account of the occurrence is a fire-side story in Baluch hearths W hen a young lad of ten years, he fell backwards off a donkey; apparently he did not mind the fall, although it appears the humeral bone was fractured badly. His father, Lutaf Ali Khan, seeing that the arm was partly severed from the shoulder, cut off the entire arm and plunged the stump into boiling rogan which the people say—possibly with truth—prevents the wound going bad and hastens the healing process. The boy did not seem to feel the operation and did not even cry when the stump was put in the boiling rogan; hence his father re-christened him Purdil, i.e., stout-hearted, courageous. Purdil Khan and some other members of his family were for some time patients of mine; he was much debilitated on his return from Tabas where he had been for four months with Ali Akbar Khan during troublesome times at the beginning of the year. He returned to Seistan in the early part of June and rendered me much valuable assistance. He states the climate of Seistan is much better than that at Tabas at this season of the year. This is at variance with the generally accepted idea as gathered from the records of other travellers on this side. Sardar Syed Khan, Naroi, son of Sardar Sharif Khan, lives at Khwaja- Ahmad in the first Nawar. In 1888 Sharif Khan was invited to the Kabul Court and was treated with much favour by Abdur Rahman in return for the valuable assistance he had rendered to him (Abdur Rahman) when on his flight from Kabul.Abdur Rahman, it is said, gave the Sardar 4,000 Kabuli rupees and 1,-00 for his son as annual stipends, and asked Sharif Khan to remain with him at Kabul which the Sardar did, the Governorship meanwhile being bestowed on the elder son Syed Khan, who had remained at Khal-i-Fath. On the death of Sharif Khan at Kabul, the Amir sent for Syed Khan, who was also treated 'with favour on arrival at the Kabul Court and was offered the Governorship of some out-of-the-way place near Kafiristan : it being a policy of Amir Abdur Rahman never to bestow any hereditary appointment in order to possess himself of proprietary rights, and stifle local tribal influence which might be an opposing factor in his own administration on the frontier. Syed Khan acceded to the Amir’s request and accepted money from him for the transport of his family to his new appointment, but on return to Khal- i-Fath he simply transported the lot, bag and baggage, into Seistan, preferring to remain near his own people rather than at the other side of Afghanistan in a doubtful appointment. It must he remembered Syed Khan’s sister had been married some years previously to Ali Akbar Khan, who was before his father’s (Mir Alum Khan) death Sartip of Seistan; consequently he claimed a refuge in Seistan from his own brother-in-law. Ali Akbar treated Syed Khan favourably and gave him some lands and the administration of villages at Khwaja-Ahmad, making him adviser also to the youn 0 * Deputy Sartip and bis mother before proceeding to Tabas to take over the Governorship there. This trust was duly carried out till Birjand influence ousted him —vide ante at page 10. Syed Khan is a middle-aged, active man ; he was summoned to Tabas soon after my arrival in Seistan to relieve Sardar Purdil Khan, consequently I did not see as much of him as 1 would have wished. What I did see I liked ; his frank and pleasing manner and voluntary information on matters then affecting British interests could not fail to appeal to me. He has some 200 footmen and a few sowars; some of my men being of the same tribe, we had a welcome when amongst them. Muhammad Ali Khan, the young brother of Syed Khan, who had been in Kabul with his father, awaited some time the return of his brother Syed Khan, but hearing he had taken refuge in Seistan, Ali Khan fled also. He then came to Peshawar vid Jalalabad, where it is reported he was kindly treated by the Deputy Commissioner Mr. Merk, but being unable to secure any appoint ment or political pension, he returned to Persia hopeless and proceeded to Kerman. On application to Persian authorities he was given the Governorship of Ladis bv the Firman-Firmai at Kerman and is now established there. Sardar Khan Jehan Sanjarani, son of Sardar Ibrahim Khan, late Gov ernor of Chakansur, lives at Saidak in the 7th Nawar beyond the Rud-i- Parian. Ibrahim Khan held Chakansur when Amir Abdur Rahaman ascended the Kabul throne, but on his death the Amir did not, as is his custom, allows the father’s rights to the son Khan Jehan. Khan Jehan fled into Seistan and was offered land which he at first refused; he came thence to Quetta and was treated as a hostage for some time there by Sir R. Sandeman. He received a kbillat from tbe Agent to the Governor-General, Baluchistan, but no political pension being sanctioned for him by the British Sirkar, he returned to Seistan. Sardar Ali Khan Sahroni of Pulgi (since deceased) at that time represented to Alum Khan, Governor of Ghain, that the Taoki tribes, who had always been under the auspices of the Sanjarani tribe in Seistan, were now without a Sardar since the death of Sardar Khan Jehan’s father who had settled in Afghan territory at Chakansur; that now, misfortune having driven his son into Seistan, he might as well be considered Sardar of the Seistan Taokis.j Sardar Ali Khan being an influential chief at the time, the authorities accepted his representations and Khan Jehan who was known to be a shrewd, c220 strong chief with much influence amongst his clan on the Chakansur side, was given lands at Siadak in the 7th Nawar, on the understanding that one- fourth Government revenue was allowed him as a Jagir. We stayed three days with Khan Jehan who treated us with the greatest courtesy and hospitality ; he supplied me with horses and donkeys which saved us many a hot mile’s tramp on the return journey, for we had to travel on foot in those parts owing to the swollen state of the Rud-i-Parian (an off-shoot of the Ilelmand river) which is unfordable at this season, and can only be crossed on tutins (reed boats). The first glance shows Khan Jehan to be an independent, resolute and indomitable character, one who cannot but inspire respect. He gave me a lengthy account of his career and of his visit fourteen years ago to the late Sir R. Sandeman at Quetta. By dint of hard work the tribe have reclaimed a good, deal of jungle land and established several villages in those parts. Khan Jehan boldly told me in front of a Persian official “ that he was a zamindar now and not in receipt of any Government allowance : the paltry one-fourth Government revenue share which accrues to him is but poor reward for his hard labour and what he has done to cultivate and reclaim these jungle lands; still, as he had fixed his abode now here and the Persians having given him an asylum, he was not faithless to his salt, but wherever he and his tribe were they felt warmly attached to the British Sirkar, and there is naturally a common bond of union between them and their kinsmen, the Sanjarani of Chagai and Dalbandin who are under the supreme Sirkar.’* Sardar Khan Jehan was united in the holy bonds of marriage while I was in Seistan, on the 1st October 1897, to a sister of Sardar Syed Khan a younger sister of the Deputy Sartip’s mother), the band-o-bast being that Sardar Khan Jehan was to give a young daughter of his, by another wife, to Syed Khan’s son on the latter’s return from babas, where he was at the time with Ali Akbar. Khan Jehan is an uncle of Sardar Ali Khan of Chagai who, from what I saw of him at Dalbandin, is but a miserable specimen, and cannot be expected to exercise either influence or moral force in the administration of Chagai. The Persian policy with regard to these Afghan refugees is to assist and settle them along the frontiers of Khorasan and Seistan. Such refugees as Sardar Khan Jehan and Syed Khan Naroi are the only safeguards against Afghans raiding the weak and easily intimidated Parsiban which for years previously had been the case. Since the above-noted Sardars have been established in Seistan, it is a well- known fact that there.are 100 per cent, less raids in the country, and it is said that through the Sanjarani and Naroi tribes the Persian Government have not only made substantial increase in her revenues, but have made a wall of pence between Afghanistan and Seistan, as the trans-border Afghan-Baluch will not raid his kinsman, the Seistan Baluch. Treatment of refugees by British Government. —The Baluch chiefs re peatedly pointed out to me the neglect of the British Government to show any favour to Seistan or Afghan Baluch refugees. Sardars Khan Jehan, Purdil Khan, Syed Khan, and Muhammad Ali Khan particularly brought this to my notice in their own case, and also in the case of Taj Muhammad Khan Sarbandi who, on escape from Tehran, came to Seistan to say a last farewell to his kinsmen, and on being pursued by Mir Alum Khan fled to Kandahar, where it is said he did hard service with Sir Oliver St. John, and in compensation but a small subsidiary allowance was allotted him, when in Quetta; and on his death his widow and children had to return to Seistan penniless and are now living on the bounty of Sardar Purdil Khan. Seistan Revenue Collector. —One other man of importance is Mir Abas of Iskil. On the father’s side he comes of an ancient Arab family, on the mother’s a Baluch chieftain’s daughter. His family have enjoyed remission of Government lands in several villages by hereditary rights for many years, since Jahangir Khan’s time it is stated..z 21 He holds the contract for octroi in Seistan and also trades. He has steadily improved his position and wealth, and the officials are somewhat jealous of his well-being and influence with the priests and people. Beino- a clever, sharp and straightforward man and having sufficient interests in the country to support him, he has given the authorities no oppor tunity to encroach on his interests; he bears no kindly feeling towards the Parsiban officials. It may be said of Mir Abas “laugb and grow fathe is a young man of 40 years, and always wears a genial frank smile of contentment; he rendered t le Mission throughout our stay in Seistan some genuine service, and is most loyally disposed to the British Sirkar. It is satisfactory to note that the chiefs and tribes inhabiting Seistan and the intervening districts are almost without exception loyal to the British Sirkar ; this I also found to be so in Southern Perso-Baluchistan and Sarhad on my former tour. Feeling of the people—British prestige undoubtedly holds a high place in the esteem of all both in Persian-Baluchistan, Seistan, Southern Khorasan, and Western Afghanistan, as expressively illustrated in the expression frequently inven ven t t° by the Sardars and people, viz., Sag-i-zard biradar-i-shignal, ^.e., the yellow dog is a brother of the jackal, meaning that the I arsibans are bad enough, but the Russians would be no better. Baluchistan and Afghanistan are always spoken of as Mal-i-Angrez, and many are of opinion we have some lien on Seistan by arrangement with the Shah. # None but the higher officials of Birjand, Tabas and Seistan knew or cared anything of plague, but all, of high and low degree, were cognisant of the tact that the trade routes had been closed at the instigation of Russia ; the possi bility of the Russians now annexing Khorasan and Seistan as they had encroach- ed on Northern Persia was openly discussed on many occasions by the officials, clergy and more enlightened people. As far as my experience goes, the people of Southern Khorasan and Seistan are averse to the probable presence of Russia, and her action m causing the routes to be closed has not increased her popularity. The fact of our presence and prolonged stay in the country r ^ se . to the rumour, which spread far and near throughout Khorasan and Afghanis tan, that the British Sirkar had caused the routes to be opened again in face ot Russian influence. In conversation with the officials, clergy and more educated, fee ers weie repeatedly thrown out as to the possibility of the purchase an mcorpora ion of Seistan with British-Baluchistan, which remote contingency seems to be t e great desire of all excepting “ Birjandi &amp; Co. ” I frankly told all that the British Government were not desirous of acquiring or adding any more to her already large possessions , icr esne was o protect her own, open up the avenues of commerce to all nations and peace with her neighbours.CHAPTER IV. STRATEGICAL ROUTE, TRADE PROSPECTS, etc. Having for two months anxiously awaited further orders as to the recall of the Mission and receiving none, in reply to my request on this head, bearing date of 28th August 1897, suffering as I was from dysentery and insomnia, I determined to leave Seistan. The limit too of the sanctioned budget estimate, 0 / 2 ., six months, having elapsed, it seemed to me on carefully weighing the condition of affairs that I was not justified in prolonging the stay of the Mission in the country, knowing that special sanction of the Government of India was necessary in accordance with Civil Service Regulations anent such deputations. Having therefore carried out all the political, professional and other duties imposed on me during our stay of seven months, and travelled every acre of the country which enabled me to compile very complete statistics on resources, revenues, and other subjects of special interest, both political and strategical, as well as a thorough survey, there did not appear to me to be any special cause for my remaining any longer in the country, besides which I had inspected and started all the Kafilas from Seistan which set forth on their journey at this season of the year. On the 20th October 1897, we turned our backs on Seistan heading south over the dreary and arid plains again, en route for Quetta. Return journey .—We retraced our steps from Seistan as far as Saindak, from which place we returned by a more northerly route, rid Amir Chah, rations having been laid down on this route for the cavalry escort which I had purposed sending back at an earlier period, but did not do so eventually conse quent on the aspect of Seistan affairs. Our journey back was unmarked by any incidents other than those naturally consequent on rapid and long marches in varying temperature, and a paucity of water, at all times bad, often at distances of from 20 to 45 miles or more apart. Disadvantages of the Northern route .—Prom Saindak to Gat-i-Barot rid Amir Chah, the country is very desert and waterless, and cannot be considered either a promising or practicable route. Up to the time of our leaving Baluchistan no water had been found between Saindak and Amir Chah, although “ Ido” pahoar of great fame, had worked hard for six months to sink wells at Drana Koh and Zeh, nor is there any between the long weary stretch from Amir Chah to Mizzil. On the other hand, as will be seen by a glance at map No. 1, water is found at reasonable intervals on the southern parallel route in this vicinity, excepting on the Siastarji plateau where, in several spots, water is near the surface and could easily be obtained. With little difficulty such as cleansing out and repairing existing wells, sinking a few new ones, and above all, building pucca watering troughs to prevent pollution of water, the great natural necessity of our existence over any trade route that it is contemplated to popularize, a better and purer water supply could be guaranteed all along the southern route. The greater part of the route between the above-named places is over heavy sandy going and across lofty sand dunes. Apart from the information of the nomadic inhabitants, one can easily see the character of the country has undergone great changes consequent on shifting sands. The country is exposed and unguarded by hills on the north, a vast sand desert stretches away right up to and beyond the Helmand river, and all the year round the country being subject to violent wind storms, it is not unnatural23 to expect that the entire character of the country will still further undergo great changes. From Ismail an intermediate route runs south between the northern route and the one we proceeded by, joining at Kundi {vide map); this Nohli-Salgaz- Kundi line will at once suggest itself as being the most direct. The most practicable and strategical line for all purposes appears to me to run from Quetta * to Ismail; along that we travelled, thence to Kundi by the above t onwards, following our route across the Amalaf and Siastargi plateaus to Saindak. Saindak should be a central depot and strong post, it is on the high road to everywhere in these parts, leading as it does from Seistan and Afghanistan to Mashkhel, Jalk, Makran, Kharan, Dalbandin and Quetta. Had it not been for the presence and protection afforded by our post at Amir Chah, the kafila proprietors and merchants informed me this is a preferable route. I would here state that I have pointed this out to Mr. Barnes, Agent to the Governor-General, Baluchistan, as also to Lieutenant Webb-Ware, the Political Officer, Chagai, suggesting at the same time the advisability of trans ferring the greater number of the levies from Amir Chah to Saindak and placing all under a strong crafty native, leaving but a small post at the former place which requires but little guarding. It is in this very vicinity that the Damini tribe cause such trouble and interfere with our trade, blocking the route by perpetual raids and bolting into the fastness of Mirjawa range. It will, therefore, be seen how important it is to have a strong post at Saindak to check the Damini who dominate the entire western districts. From Saindak to the frontier the most practicable route, I think, will be found to follow along the skirts of the hills as straight as the nature of this rugged dctitnin will admit. A glance at my map will show the exact places, with their names, where water is available all the year round (coloured in blue circles or crosses) along the whole routes travelled. If, for strategical or other purposes, it is ever contemplated to construct a railway and link up Eastern Persia with Quetta, this must be the line of advance, and not, I think, that via Amir Chah, if we wish to avoid a similar source of anxiety which the Russian administration have to combat with in the section of her Trans-Caspian Railway between Merv and Charjui.J This line runs through lofty sand dunes, from which the sand is always on the move under the influence of perpetual wind, and necessitates a considerable expenditure to protect it from being rapidly obliterated. I was glad to see that the Political Agent, Chagai, acting on the sugges tions and recommendations made by me in my earlier letters to Mr. Barnes, Agent to the Governor-General, Baluchistan, had caused supply dep6ts to be placed along the route at convenient centres; these are a great boon not only to traders, but to the nomad tribes along these deserts. § Local appreciation of the re-opening of the Seistan-Nushki route .—Many encouraging signs are manifest to betoken an increased appreciation of the opening up of the Baluchistan-Seistan caravan route. The returns from February to October 1897 as seen in Lieutenant Webb- Ware’s report give the total value of the exports and imports as over SJ lakhs, * * * § * Or via Bolau, Darwaza, Mastung, Kanak up to Nuskki as suggested by Colonel Bell, V.C .—vide “ Report on a journey from Quetta to Trebizond,” page ii of Preface.—B. C. ■j- Tbis short section was not travelled over by my party, but from information received and the general confi guration of the surrounding country as seen when passing close on either side, I hare reason to believe there are no topographical difficulties whatever.—B. C. I The line projected by Colonel Sir T. H. Holdich according to the recent Indo-Afghan Boundary Commission is now outside the British sphere of influence. Without interfering at all with Seistan or encroaching on Afghan territory, a light railway, following the above suggested route, would be equally suitable for commercial or strategical purposes.— B. C. § The major portion of the suggestions and recommendations made by me to the Agent, Governor-General, Baluchistan, have been embodied under the head of “ Improvements ” on page 18, paragraph 28, of Lieutenant Webb Ware’s report cn the Baluchistan-Persian Caravan Route.24 and it is only fair to assume that these figures would possibly have been much higher but for the adverse infiuence exerted by .Russian action, in blocking the trade by causing the frontier to be closed “ on the plea of plague,” whereby traders were afraid to send out kafilas and traffic practically came to a standstill. The Khorasan and Seistan kafila season opens in August, and several lar^e caravans both for Quetta, Khorasan, Bam, and Jalk were inspected by me before starting from the country ; steps must be taken to protect the interests of traders and counteract Eussian intrigue, both in Khorasan and Seistan, if we are to ensure the rapid expansion of this trade which may be said to be but in its infancy. Future trade prospects .—There is a very large field open in tea alone if the Indian tea-planters and merchants bestir themselves and wish to* regain the trade with Central Asia which was formerly in their hands some years ago. As regards the future prospects of a tea trade—provided it be green, which is preferred all over Persia—there cannot be a doubt. Eussia cannot supply the market; her tea is inferior, and it is said—possibly with a microbe of truth that the bouquet of their tea is affected by the passage across the Caspian in petroleum steamers. Against the expansion of our trade on this side the entire weight of Eussian influence in Iran is now being exerted. How strong this is may be gathered from the events narrated in this report. P ; The difficulties of the intervening route have been much exaggerated as exemplified in my rapid return journey from Seistan, covering a distance of 579 miles with cavalry in 22 days. All along the return journey there were not wanting evidence of contentment under the new rule, and on enquiry we were invariably informed affairs w^ere much more peaceable and settled even in this short time since the acquisition of this territory by the Indo-Afghan Boundary Commission. ® The people appreciate and applaud the British Sirkar’s large expenditure for their well being in opening up these routes. Lieutenant Webb-Ware, Poli tical Officer, Chagai, is actively engaged in improving this route; thanas and posts have been established, and many of the difficulties about water, etc. have already been surmounted. I append herewith a list of the leading merchants in Seistan ; these traders w ere interviewed by me, and all the advantages of the opening up of these old Khorasan-Sind routes thoroughly explained to them. They were exhorted to bestir themselves and follow in the foot-steps of their forefathers who had travelled these routes in by-gone days under great difficulties; British gold had reopened the high-ways and portals, and it &amp; now remained for them to emulate the deeds of their fathers and revive the tmrl a with Central Asia and India.

The Political horizon. —At present Russia does not appear desirous of violating the Afghan frontier, hut seeks rather to conciliate the Amir 1 (by a pro posed mission to Kabul last June), and the establishment—by agreement with Persia—of strong positions along the Afghan frontier, through Khorasan, so as to menace India on any future occasion, and meanwhile counteract the rapid and increasing British prestige and commercial prospects so recently streng thened by the acquisition of Chagai and Baluchistan as far west as Koh-l- Malik Siah, which brings our frontier within easy distance of Seistan and Ivhorasan. The present activity of our northern rival in this quarter since the Indo- Afghan Boundary Commission and co-incident with the outbreak of plague in India and frontier troubles is but another example of her procedure all over the world just now, viz., fix here a mine, there a mine, to charge with the necessary inflammables but to withhold the fuze till the ripe occasion. Her political and military policy are an interesting study to follow. The rapid advance and completion of the Trans-Siberian Railway to Vladivostok, and strengthening of this place. Her doings in Northern China and Corea to counteract British interests with Japan and China. The rapid construction of the Central Asian Railway from Samarkand to Tashkand, and branch extension to Khokand of significant importance. Her more recent move establishino* a permanent Political Agent in Abyssinia to counteract our Egyptian and Nile policy. Her union with Prance and outstretched hand to Germany and Afghanistan. The Turko-Grecian war, too, is a most suitable occasion to bring about a settlement of Cretian affairs, and the pending negotiations relative to the administration (by her) of certain Asia Minor territories which are really designs to acquire two important places, viz., Rizak and Jorak, in the south east corner of the Black Sea, and with which object she has voted 20,850,000 roubles for the purpose of constructing the Tiflis-Kars Railway which it is calculated wdll be opened in 1899. Thus it is, all along the Afghan frontier and in Northern Persia, everything has more or less been quietly pushed on and prepared for years, and with her present interest with the Sbah-in-Shah it is not unlikely certain Khorasan concessions may fall to Russia’s lot. Strategical notes. —Russian jealousy of our recent acquisition in Baluchis tan—which brings our frontier posts up to the borders of Seistan—is very great, and now that she sees the Pamir bulwarks are unsurmountable, and those routes not worth considering further, she is quietly but steadily pushing on her influence on the Khorasan side which it requires no very far-seeing perception to perceive, is the only assailable point now open to her, from which she can hope to menace Afghanistan or advance on India. As pointed out by Colonel Bell, V.C., “ Khorasan is as good a base as Russia need wish, for without Herat, it includes Seistan.” The Pearl of Eastern Persia. —Seistan—with its relative position to Afghanistan and British Baluchistan as secure by nature as she is weak by art on the west being separated from the Neh and Narmashir districts by innumer able parallel ranges, divided by narrow torrent beds, and barren plateaus, where without any exception there are no villages or habitations, and water-supply scant and bad, where the approaches from the north for the greater part of the year are cut off by an immense hamoon—is much more easy of access by us than by our northern rival. Watered by the noble Helmand which not only causes the country to be extremely irrigated, hut for the greater part of the year practically turns it into * Vide Appendix A, letter No. 9, dated 27th August 1897.—B.C.27 an island, what might it be, if this the great natural necessity of any country were hut controlled by head canals and the country in other hands ? Being a rich grain-growing, large pasturage, camel and^ flock-rearing dis trict, whose resources under proper control could be hugely increased, it might he turned into a regular garden, and is certainly “ the Bearl of Persia ” on this side, the golden key to the situation whichever power secures it. I hope that power will he England : she will then hold a Cf Royal Flush,” and need not he intimidated by any amount of bluff further north. Climate of Seistan. —On the principle of giving the devil his due, the climate is not at all so bad as we have been led to believe by other travellers ; the erroneous idea hitherto prevalent, purely surmise, that the country is un suited to European occupation all the year round, is quite misleading. There is nothing to depress the bodily powers and produce the lassitude from which we suffer during a hot weather in the plains of India. Throughout the hot season the heat is tempered by northern winds and the nights are fairly cool. There are no hardships which a moderate degree of foresight in preparations will not overcome. The outlook. —Khorasan and Meshed are practically at the mercy of the Czar; if he wishes to occupy Northern Persia, he can do so, forjneither Persian nor our troops would be able to prevent him. Such a measure is almost sure to pre cede Russia’s operations against Afghanistan and Herat in particular, and it seems that unless we are well prepared and warned, Seistan and Persian- Baluchistan might fall into her hands before our troops could arrive on the scene.* Birjand strategically and commercially is an important point, though much less so than Seistan, or indeed any point north of it as far as England is con cerned. Khorasan is a non-grain-growing district beyond local requirements, and is largely dependent on Seistan for grain and grazing.! The intervening distance (225 miles) between Birjand and Seistan is prac tically a desert and waterless stretch, the routes north to Meshed are far more difficult than are those from Quetta. The difficulties of a force attacking from Khorasan are infinitely greater than for a force approaching from Baluchistan; an army of any numbers could not well march through Khorasan with the Seistan granary in our hands, and would be placed in a most embarrassing position were they to attempt it. With a railway running to Seistan we should undoubtedly be in a strong position to thwart all designs and to check Russian advance through Persia by threatening the flank of a force marching eastward, or meeting a direct attack in a very suitable position, and on decidedly advantageous terms to us. The line of communication with our base at Quetta would he some 607^ miles in length t whereas the Russian line of communication taking Askabad as her base w T Ould be some 680 miles§ from Seistan ; such is the present position of the rival powers. It is not plague but Herat and Indian trade, etc., that is under observation in Khorasan; the spirit of commercial jealousy and especially Afghan politics are the sole cause of Russian activity. Threatening clouds, —It would be interesting to know why the Russian Legation at Tehran demanded in July “ the cancelling of the Persian Govern ment orders” reopening the Seistan-Nushki route when Her Britannic Majesty’s Charge d*Affaires caused them to be reopened on receipt of represent ations from the Indian Government, acting on the suggestions contained in my telegraphic despatch|| from Kirtaka previously referred to. * * * § * Colonel Bell, V. C , mentions in his report having seen the secret report of the Governor-General of the Caucasus on Russian eastern policy. He says : “On page 8 will be found a menace against Baluchistan, which as already stated, considers itself British.”—B.C. f Vide Appendix A, letter No. 9, dated 27th August 1897, paragraph 7.—B.C. The amount of grain exported from Seistnn to Khorasan, Narmashir, Sarhad, Jalk, and Baluchistan can hardly be •magined considering the slovenly farming and requirements of a thickly populated country like Seistau, B.C. t I make it 527i miles from Quetta to our Rohat post, and from Robat to Sehkuha 80 miles, i.e,, total 007 $ miles. It would be considerably shorter by the intermediate route suggested on page 23.—B.C. § Mileage as given by Lieutenant the Hon’ble H. D. Napier.—B.C. || Vide Appendix A, letter No. 8, dated 22nd August 1897, paragraph 4.—B.C. D 2 |28 Her recent move at Tehran offering to place officers and non-commissioned officers at the disposal of the Sbah-in-Shah to reorganise and drill the Persian Army is but the thin end of the wedge. If such a proposal be accepted, we may safely predict the establishment of Russian officers and men along the frontier in the important commercial entre pots, such as Turbat-i-Haidari, Khaf, Birjand, and Seistan, doubtless occupying the recently built Residency at Nasratabad, and those about to be constructed in Birjand, etc., under the disguise of Military Instructors to the Persian troops. It was odd and somewhat disappointing after a liberal distribution of Toshakhana and in the face of the orders of the Hashmat-ul-M ulk, Governor of Tabas and Seistan, that the Seistan officials should have so resented our presence as to issue orders and plot to try and force me to withdraw from the country. This I attribute to the under-current of Russian intrigue. There is no doubt the Moscovite is assiduously preparing her path for a future occupation of Khorasan, and time will show whether her so-called “ posts of observation ” are a fallacious or appropriate nomenclature. There is danger pending in this quarter of Persia. I am afraid I am not competent to offer comment or criticism beyond a certain point—upon the many recommendations regarding the policy it is pro posed to adopt with regard to Seistan. I do not hold with the political dementia—for it cannot be considered any thing else—which underlies tbe suggestions made by some, viz .— (1) Advance, annex or lease the country. (2) Install at once a British Agent in Seistan. I will briefly state w r hy—as to the first—military opinion is against employing a force at a point so distant from our base; further it must be a natural surmise that Russian advance on India will not be through Southern Khorasan and Seistan (it might he used as an alternative route or base*), but by a more north ern one via Herat and Kandahar. As to the second, the question of such an appointment must not be lost sight of; an agent there to protect our trade interest and check Russian intrigue unquestionably would be worth having, yet I do not think just now such an extreme measure would serve any useful purpose and might excite our northern rival to greater activity. Prudence suggests that we should count the cost of the consequences before embarking on any such scheme which might in all probability lead on to supporting the British Agent by a force. To safeguard our interests in Seistan, and pursue tbe line of policy I have begun, it remains for me but to repeat the suggestions previously made in mv letter bearing date the 20th November 1897, on return from Seistan, viz .— A well-educated, crafty, diplomatic native accompanied by an Assistant Apothecary should be sent to replace me in Seistan ; such a combination will suffice to counteract the present Russian influence firmly established there in the person of the news-writer and his agents. The former will keep us posted in all matters, assist traders, and enhance British prestige amongst the Mullas, Sardars, and people of the country. The Apothecary will be a companion to the Native Political Assistant, will have great weight, and do much good in a country where 50 per cent, of the inhabitants die from want of medical treatment. An officer might be deputed to move along the frontier from Seistan to Meshed or vice versa next autumn and visit Birjand, Khaf, Tabas, Turbat- i-Haidari, etc., and watch proceedings. We must recognise the paramount necessity of checking without loss of time Russian activity in Khorasan, particularly with a view to prevent her getting a foothold in any spot between Meshed and Seistan; copious sources of * Vide A journey from Quetta to Trebizoud (by Colonel M. S. Bell, V.C., A.-D.-C.), pnge XI of Prefa.ce.—R.C. %29 information have revealed to me that astounding progress has been made towards the realisation of this project. Her influence with the present Shah is great; he has been a protege of Russia for years at Tabriz while awaiting his succession to the throne ; such interest may bring about the desired result. Good services rendered by those who accompanied the Mission .—In con clusion, it only remains for me to record the good services rendered by those who accompanied the Mission ; notwithstanding the great hardships entailed by all ranks, the party stood the constant marching during a trying hot weather well; they cheerfully performed all duties deputed to them, overcoming all obstacles with ever-smiling faces. Assistant Apothecary Abas Ali was indefatigable throughout, not only in the performance of his own professional duties which were very arduous (our tents were on all occasions besieged by sick from far and near), but other res ponsible and multifarious duties fell to his lot. On him fell the responsible task of looking after all the transport arrange ments, distribution of supplies, etc., by no means a light duty. On two occa sions he was absent from the main party on special and important duties, on one occasion for ten days andtigain for a month, and on each occasion he travelled long distances in great heat and under peculiarly difficult circum stances. To his tact and accurate carrying out of orders I attribute the success of both these duties. Though comparatively a young man, his head is screwed on the right way. Should a professional Native Assistant be hereafter required m Seistan or other remote part of the country, it would, I think, be difficult to find a better qualified subordinate. , I bring his good services prominently to the notice of Government and strongly recommend him for departmental promotion. Rhan Bahadur Surveyor Asgar Ali Beg, in addition to his survey work and mannin' which speaks for itself, rendered much assistance in extraneous duties. D He is a painstaking, neat draftsman, was assiduous m the performance of his duties and for previous good service received, while absent with me, his well-earned Khan Bahadurship. Sher Ali clerk, performed his duties creditably, many of which were of a delicate nature, and worked hard throughout the journey. He lost no oppor- tunity of explaining the favours of the Government be has the honour to serve, and did much good amongst the clergy, Sardars and people of the country. I recommend him also as worthy of departmental promotion. I cannot speak too highly of the energy, zeal, and reliability of Quazi Fakir Ahmad ; he was sent ihead of the Mission to make all arrangements for transport and laying down of supplies across the Registan. The rapidity of my march threw an additional strain on his organisation, and the fact that the requirements of the party were fully met refiects great credit on the manner in which he performed this arduous duty, adding to the many good services he has previously rendered to Government. Quazi p ak “ Abroad accompanied Captain McMahon. C.I.E., on the Kabul Miss.on in 1893 and also accompanied the same officer on the Baluch-Afghan Boundary 1894 and 1895. His tact and influence with all natives, superadded to good manners enable me to recommend him witli confidence for the fulfilment of “ V duties of a secret or political nature with which he may he entrusted For big many good services I think the honorary distinction of Khan Bahadur would be well bestowed on Quazi Fakir Ahmad. It is a pleasing duty to record my appreciation of the excellent services of Daffadars Muhammad Azim, Ghulam Hyder Khan and the men of the Sind Horse who accompanied me as escort. They cheerfully and ably performed the w marches and arduous duties throughout, and when in camp alone during my absence on four occasions maintained excellent discipline and soldierlike ^^'jamadar Jhanda Khan, with sixteen Rustamzai levies who also accompanied the Mission, rendered very valuable assistance to Government.30 No day or night was too long for Jhanda Khan and his men to perform the Sirkar s work; I found Jhanda Khan’s influence and service amongst the several Baluch tribes we came across both within and beyond British territory of the greatest service. ^ Purchase of camels for Indian Transport .—Having heard that the Secretary of State for India had sanctioned the present Indian Camel Transport being raised to 3,250 animals, of which there were 800 with the Punjab Army and 100 left over from those purchased for the Chitral Campaign, leaving 2,350 to be purchased, I sent in a proposal to the head of the Department concerned requesting permission to be allowed to purchase some camels.* I cannot help stating it seems to me a great pity, not to say loss to Gov ernment, that this recommendation did not receive attention, for as pointed out, a double purpose and considerable saving would have resulted. An unavoidable and by no means a small expenditure had to be made for payment of camel hire for laying down all the grain purchased for Kobat Thana, as well as the supply for the return of the Mission. Had permission been granted for the purchase of a couple of hundred camels, all this would have been saved; these camels would have conveyed the grain during the month of August to Robat,* and thence onwards to Quetta with the Mission : no additional outlay would have resulted beyond the initial purchase, as I had sufficient spare men to drive and graze them, they could then have joined the Indian Camel Transport. This plan seemed to me a more practical and feasible one in comparison with the proposal that was on foot of having a trial shipment of the IMit framed smaller Somali camel from Somali land, where considerable risk of ship ment and carriage by sea has to be taken into account. The expenditure of a few thousand rupees in the purchase of these camels amongst the nomad tribes on our newly-acquired frontier would also have a beneficial effect. I purchased several superior barbardari camels, also fast trotting camels to replace those that had died on the journey, at very reasonable prices.

No. 2 (Secret), dated Nasratabad, Seistan, the 23rd May 1897. From— Surgeon-Majoe G. W. Brazieb-Creagh ; A.M.S., To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I arrived here at the capital on 14th instant, and was duly received in the usual Persian manner, everything being arranged for our supplies, comfort, etc. Having, as stated in former letter, visited several larger towns and obtained information of importance which guided my line of conduct on arrival at the capital, I timed my entry here, so as to have all interchange of visits with Persian officials over before the entry of Russian Medical Officer. The Sartip here is but a boy and puppet in the hands of others. He is the only son of Ali Akbar Khan of Tabas, who is Governor of Tabas and Seistan. The son and mother act here in the father's interest. The mother is a sister of “ Sayed Khan,' Chief of Naori Baluch (a large clan), and Sayed Khan is really the head official, a man of considerable influence and property along the Persian- Afghan border. The day after Lieutenant Webb-Ware’s departure from here, Abdul Rahim Khan—a medical official of His Highness the Shah, and trained in Paris Medical Schools—arrived at Nasirabad from Tehran, stayed a few days and returned. At first it was arranged at Tehran, that this doctor should accompany the Russian Medical Officer from Meshed, but the latter not reaching Meshed in time, the former came on alone. He is reported to have been very pompous here and to have bullied the authorities, and the purport of one of his interviews with the Sartip was—“ Why the Sartip permitted English officers to cross the frontier.' On one occasion he got angry with a servant of the Sartip, and is reported to have thrashed him severely. For the past two years since Napier's visit, the Russians have been very busy here, and their activity through local agents is very surprising as will be seen from the following. This activity too is not limited, as far as I am able to ascertain, to Seistan, but extends all along the line of communication to Meshed, as news-writers are established at Neh, Birjaud, Tabas, etc., etc., besides which, several traders are in their secret service and push their trade at each place. The closing of all routes, the Sartip and his officials state, directly emanated from the Shah, and they have simply to obey the orders imposed on them. As far as they are con cerned, they appear to regret that all routes are closed as it stops their traffic, and surplus grain will rot, if not exported into Baluchistan, where a considerable amount goes. Only a few officials know or care anything of plague, but it is a general topic of conver sation amongst all lower classes both here and further east and west that it is the Russians who have stopped the trade routes, and we are askedWhy the English Sarkar permits it.' W'e undoubtedly hold a high place in the esteem of all. both Persian and Baluch, and this is only too patent now even with the presence of the northern party and the expenditure of a good deal of their money. Muhammad Akram Khan, a Parsiban merchant here now, is in Russian secret service and has a shop in the bazar; he pushes trade in Russian goods of all sorts. For the past six years he was employed in Russian secret service at Kandahar, but being suspected he escaped, visited Meshed and has since teen established here in a similar capacity. This man accompanied Lieutenant Webb-W'are from here to Robat, assisting him in the purchase of supplies and procuring camels ; stayed seven days at Robat awaiting my arrival to serve me !!! also, and help me in the country. Finding 1 had not come, and being due else where, he returned and proceeded with Muhammad Rahim Khan to meet the Russian officer and arrange all for his journey across the desert from Neh. Mirza Muhammad Rahim Khan, otherwise known as “ Khan Meshedi,' a resident of Nasirabad, has for the past 1^ years been openly and without any secrecy a news-writer here, and being supplied with Russian money unstintedly, has built a fine large and pretentious house which has undoubtedly been constructed with some ulterior purpose than that which it is sup posed to be. The architecture and surroundings have been designed with a view to other than a Persian occupation, and the Russian Medical Officer now is cosily established there, much to the envy of his confrere and party who shelter under canvas. These two men above noted are now the right hand parties of the Russian officer, and they manage all household and transport arrangements. The Russian officer with escort of eight Cossacks arrived on the morning of 18th May, and he appears to have come to stay for an indefinite period.32 We have paid visits and exchanged opinions on the probable advance of plague. Politics have not been mentioned, though he has on more than one occasion been very careful to tell me he does not seek to question me for that purpose, but for his own information when matters outside our professional jurisdiction crop up. That intrigue is rampant there can be no question ; even the very walls have ears and you dare not trust any one. The Russian Medical Officer now awaits further orders from Meshed, and I hear from a reliable and secret source that he is very desirous either to visit or send some of his men to Robat to see if arrangements are satisfactory for plague ! This, of course, I will prevent, and must act in the matter without any orders to the contrary, and, if he persists, it will be under protest. My arrangements between here and Robat are complete, as I have only my own sowars on the line and trust no one. If the line is open and secure beyond question from Robat to Quetta, it would be well, and if not, no time should be lost in placing reliable men—sowars or such like—along the line. Two emissaries from here have gone on via Robat to Quetta, particulars of which have been given in extenso to the Agent to the Governor-General, Quetta. It is very important that we should guard our frontier posts at Robat and Amirchah as jealously as do the Russians now between Ashkabad and Kuchan, and a strong crafty native trained in Baluchistan Agency work should be posted there. It seems very desirable to me to make arrangements to place another man in here and to quietly have a residence built now for such an one while I am here and can arrange for the same, so that if we leave the country later on, there can be a man here in a similar position to Russian Agent to represent British interests. Should such a proposal be entertained, please let me know early as it will be necessary to seek some protection for men and horses in a very short time as it is now hot. My northern communication with Colonel Yate is dangerous, and I dare not trust com munications. Russian troops are reported to be on the Afghan frontier north near Turbat-i- Sheikh Jam and at Arigh and Birjand. The Russian Medical Officer states it has been reported that plague has got into Kabul and Kandahar. He also informed me that a Russian officer has been posted to Kerman, Shiraz, and Bandar Abbas, as also Bombay, all of which of course is new to me, as I have had no communication since I left Quetta. The Amir is reported to be ill, and Russian activity may possibly have fermented in con* sequence, fearing any trouble in succession to the throne in case of his death. Russian influence at Tehran seems now to have a strong foothold under new Shah. Russian Medical Officer is now collecting camels and preparing to make round of Seistan under charge of the two men noted, and states he has orders to place cordons wherever he thinks desirable. Our spheres of influence ought to be distinctly marked out. I purpose claiming all right of protecting line from Robat, right up to here, i.e., southern line bordering on our frontier, and so, if possible, prevent his crossing intervening toe of land between Hurmak and Sehkoh. It is also reported that Ali Akbar Khan will lose, or has lost, the Governorship of Seistan consequent on the murder of Darwesh Khan, and bis brother the Governor of Birjand, who is a Russophobe, is working against him, hence the summoning of sowars from here to Tabas. If this be so, trouble is apprehended and Sayed Khan (brother of Sartip's mother) has claimed our protection. He was not permitted to visit me, but did so secretly and expressed a hope that, as we were his nearest neighbour next to Afghanistan, we would protect his rights. One of the Russian Medical Officer’s men the other day when left alone for a few moments, seized the opportunity of asking one of my guides whom he knew when here with Lieutenant Webb-Ware, if “ Ido ” had succeeded in getting water in the well he was digging near Amirchah. This will go to show the interest being taken in our frontier. We have one great advantage in being in a position to treat all sick who come from far and near on camels, horses, donkeys, etc., whereas the Russian Medical Officer has no medicines or appliances, and sends them to me saying he did not come here prepared to treat sick. Morning and evening the camp is surrounded with sick, and while he dispenses money and receives visitors all night and compiles revenue and other statistics, we have the same parties here under treatment giving full particulars of what is taking place. As stated in my previous report on Eastern Persia, medicine and treatment of their sick appeal more than anything that could be done with the people of the country. The Russian Medical Officer has visited the head Mulla here also, and this is a practice adopted up north ; I am in possession of his representations in that quarter to the effect that the Russians are inclined to bring troops here and make quarters here in opposition to the British Government occupation of Robat.There is strong; grounds for supposition that should anything occur, or plague appear anywhere near, that cordons of troops will filter in here and elsewhere. The idea hitherto very erroneously believed that British troops could not occupy the country during the summer is quite a mistake. It is not at all so hot here now, and we are not by any means suffering, though under canvas. Punkas quite unnecessary up to date. Nights very cool, days warm and very dry j later on it gets warmer, but only for two months I fancy. The pestilential horsefly is also a myth up to date; all our horses are fit and doing well with proper food, which was very scant en route, even though they are picketted out. No. 3 (Secret), dated Camp Nasratabad, Seistan, the 7th June 1897. From—S ttbgeon-Majoe G. W. Bbazieb-Cbbagh, A.M.S., on Special Duty, Seistan, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to submit herewith a summary of events, in continuation of my letter No. 2, dated 23rd May 1897. Dated the 7th June 1897. I Q n 26th May, it was reported that Sardar Muhammad Sharif Khan, of Farrah, had been murdered by His Highness the Amir. A week ago his corpse reached Farrah for burial. About a month ago the corpse of Sardar Maula Dad Khan, Governor of Farrah, had also arrived from Kabul. 2. Rumour states both men have been poisoned under the Amir’s orders for mistakes in accounts. These two murders have caused great sensation on the frontier, as the Sardars were influential and much respected, and people say now His Highness the Amir is not a friend even to his own sect—Sunni—to which these men also belonged. 3. On 27th May, the Russian Medical Officer left here for a tour round south-east vii Sehkuha. The same morning on hearing this I went on tour due east to the Helmaud, and worked south along the line he bad come. His visit was a hurried one, and he turned up at the same snot on the bank of the Helmand where I was in camp, early on the morning of 30th. He affected much surprise at our meeting. The Medical Officer would not halt, but proceeded on to Banjar by which I had come. 4. I crossed the Helmaud and visited all the frontier towns—Milak being important as centre of trade route from Bokhara via Herat, Sabzwar, Farrah, and Seistan. A kafila had just passed through to Sehkuha before my arrival a few days. 5 The bed of the Helmand has for the last two years altogether changed. Formerly the river took a bend 2 miles south of Milak and flowed north by east. It now flows straight on west of Milak, cutting off several villages, and the old bed contains but little water. 6, Lost a horse crossing the river which is now in high flood. Visiting other towns of importance, seat of merchants and trade. I returned to Nasratabad on 4th June 1897. 7 Durino- this visit all the merchants and officials came to salaam to me, and some con trary to order°came secretly at night. I pointed out to all parties concerned the steps taken bv the British Government now to ojren up routes, which gave general satisfaction to all, and 1 have reason to anticipate that a lot of the trade that has hitherto passed along from Northern Afghanistan via previously noted routes through Seistan on to Bandar Abbas vid ^asratabad and Bam will next cold weather find its way to Quetta. 8 At Killa Nao, I found a Balucii kafila from Jalk, which had been with Farrah traders as far as the Helinand ford, and were now carrying grain back. Also found here some of a oartv of 25 Hazaras who had arrived eight days back from Quetta, two being time-expired men of 26th Baluch Regiment. Inspected them and placed them under quarantine restrictions. They were all found to be fit and hardy after 4U days’ tramp and no sign either of disease or debility. 9 These are the parties anent whom the Russian Medical Officer threatened local officials and people. A large assembly of all parties concerned headed by Kad K.uda and some 18 mer chants visited me, to whom I pointed out that our interests were purely commercial as far as Seistan was concerned, and that the Indian Government would see that those interests were not interfered with. The routes had been closed, but I had every reason for stating that they would again be opened in a short time, etc., etc. : this put a different aspect on affairs, and thev were much pleased and satisfied on all heads. 10. On return I communicated with the Sartip and head Mulla, who were unanimous in expressing satisfaction at what 1 had done, even in face of opposition from Naib-ul-Hukmat, who is in all things a'staunch ally of Russia. II On 4th June immediately on our return, we found considerable excitement prevailing amongst the people of Nasratabad, and the following report corroborated by Mulla Muham mad Rahim was made to me. 1068 F. P.34 At 9 p.m. on night 31st May, the Russian news-writer was ordered by the Russian officer to bring him a young woman. News-writer being unable at the time to procure same, made arrangements to send his own female servant. The girl was accordingly sent with some things as excuse to the house ; when she reached there, the Russian officer, who was walking in the compound, caught her and was going to drag her upstairs, but the girl shrieked loudly, and neighbouring people being alarmed, several men jumped over the wall and saw the officer —in flagrante delicto —dragging the girl. The Russian news-writer was taken before the Mujtahid (head Mulla), who having heard his statements said he was of course found to be guilty. He was thereupon severely beaten and told that, if the Russian officer did not leave the country in 44 hours, the people of the country would he told to punish him according to the “ Shariat,” Muhammadan laws. 12. It is further reported that the following day the officer had submissively requested the head Mulla to let him stay four days more. 13. Also reported that officer had sent Russian news-writer to the Sartip complaining against order of Mulla, and stating that he had put up an entirely false case. The Sartip , s reply was to the effect that the case lay within the powers of the Mulla, who was absolute authority in the matter and he could not interfere. 14. This affair has caused great indignation amongst the people, and the priests are horrified at- the action and outrage of their religious teachings by violation of this girl by European officer. Both the Mullas and the Sartip, as also others, have compared the strict observance to all orders by men of my party who were left here in camp during my tour, and obeyed to the letter all injunctions laid down during my absence—neither to visit bazaar, accept invitations, nor in any way interfere with people. 15. The Sartip and his mother even sent next day to tell the English officer he could have all supplies and whatever fruit, vegetables, etc., lie wanted free from the garden (Govern- meut). Coincident with the waning of Russian prestige ours has arisen, and this case will have a lasting influence amongst inhabitants all over the country. 16. It is reported that the Zil-es-Sultau has been ordered by His Imperial Majesty the Shah to attack the Afghan frontier, and thus reprimand the Amir for murders of Hazaras. Report says the Russians have promised to ally Persia on the condition that Herat and Kandahar would be annexed with Russian boundary afterwards. 17. The presence of Russian tents at Twisk south of Earrah, as also at several places from Turuk to Koh-i-Kawar near Bunurud, is reported. 18. They are stated to be placed there as quarantine in connection with plague; have sent a man to prove veracity of report. 19. All classes of Baluch are staunch allies of the British and inwardly hate and despise Persians and never give Russia a thought. They even now fondly belie\e we in a measure own this part of the Shah's country; they are invariably to be trusted and relied on, will carry out any duty imposed on them, even under the greatest risk. I have in my camel train the relations of Darwesh Ali Khan, who was murdered at T'abas and who first gave me a history of the murder; these men have been invaluable to me since I employed them. 20. Sartip Ali Akbar Khan, Governor of Tabas and Seistan, is reported to have lost the Governorship of Tabas, and likely to lose Seistan also, consequent on murder of Darwesh Khan. If this be true, trouble is predicted in Seistan. 21. No communication since arrival has, up to date, reached me from Meshed, though I wrote two test letters to see if they would reach Colonel Yate. I dare not trust any com munications, as post is all tampered with. Unless I do hear soon, I shall have to proceed myself to Meshed when coast is clear and Russian officer gone. Am now running short of money. 22. Some 20 Hazaras came to me to petition British Govermnen fc to influence Amir of Afghanistan to have some of their people released, who are imprisoned and detained in Kabul; these escaped last year. Dated the 8th June 1897. 23. Russian dak from Birjand has mysteriously disappeared for five days when it was due. Russian messenger, who just returned from Birjand, has told us it left there six days ago’, and even dak runner is not to be found. Great anxiety in Russian camp in conse quence. 24. Locusts, a terrible pest in here now, seen in clouds over fields and plain; they regularly strip the trees in gardens quite bare, and had it not been that ciops are harvested, would do serious destruction. 25. Russian officer and party marched out this evening at 6-30 p m., destination Birjand, where he will remain for present awaiting orders. . (Sd.) G. W.

Babhes, Esq., C.S.I., Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a Diary received from Surgeon-Major Brazier-Creagh, dated Nasratabad, the 6th June 1897. Dated Nasratabad, the 6th June 1897. 1. Russian officer here yet, went on tour towards south last week, visiting towns near Sehkuha and along east, returning in my tracks. 2. Preached stoppage of routes consequent on plague and frightened people much by threatening them for having permitted a kafila to pass. 3. Have interviewed him on this head, as it is outside his sphere of influence. 4. His actions do little, if any, harm, and any influence his presence here may be supposed to have, is of very little consequence, and, by several actions committed, the Russian prestige and influence are fast waning. 5. Rumour states he leaves here to-morrow for Birjand where he will remain. 6. The presence of Russian tents at Farrah and north of it is reported, but as yet I have not corroborated the veracity of report. 7. It is reported that Ali Akhbar Khan, Governor of Tabas and Seistan, has lost the Governorship of Tabas for being instrumental in the murder of Darwesh Ali Khan near there. If this be so, it will cause much trouble in here amongst the Baluch and Kaini sections, former are much adverse to the present state of affairs. 8. Russian news-writer circulating all sorts of wild rumours anent advance of British troops into Seistan. 9. Body of some 20 Hazaras petitioned me to move to have some of their people released from Kabul who are imprisoned there, as Sartip here will not permit them to represent things at Tehran. 10. The Chief of Naroi tribe having been forced to go to Tabas with 70 men, before departure, claimed British protection in case any difficulty should hereafter arise. 11. Rumours are afloat that Persian troops under Zil-es-Sultan are ordered to attack Afghan outpost on frontier to cause reprisals consequent on Hazara murders at Kabul. 12. Russians are reported to be at the bottom of all this, and have general influence at. Tehran with present Shah. 13. Communications with Meshed still cut off. 14. The importance of adopting suggestion as to supplies being placed at thanas along route is important. Kafilas recently arrived ran short of flour en route. All along the routes in Persia at each caravansarai supplies in smsill quantities can always be purchased from the caravansarai-bashi or man in charge. Along our little inhabited desert tracks absolutely no supplies can be got. One kafila just arrived, reports loss of a man near Amir Chah having run out of provisions and water. 7th June 1897. Russian dak from Meshed has disappeared for past five days, no clue yet got, and the dak-runner is not to be found, great anxiety in Russian officers camp in consequence. Hope Colonel Yate has not written to me by it. Have not heard from him since I came in here, though 1 have sent two letters saying I would like to communicate, if he sent reliable man to me. Locusts, a terrible pest in here, seen in clouds over corn-fields and in gardens; they strip regularly bare the fruit and willow trees. Lost a camel on 29th from eating some poisonous plant, and next day lost a horse cross ing the Helmand river. 8th June 1897. Russian officer left Seistan for Birjand this evening at 6-30 p.m. (Sd.) G. W. BRAZIER-CREAGH, Surgeon-Major, A M.S. No. 4, dated Seistan, Killa-i-Nao Camp, the 30th June 1897. From—S ubgeon-Majob G. W. Beazieb-Cbeagh, A.M.S., To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. In continuation of previous communication No. 3, dated 7th June 1897, I have tne honour to report further progress and doings of the Mission :— 1. On 7th June some 25 Hazaras arrived from Quetta at Sehkuha and appealed to me tc help them to proceed onwards to Meshed on their pilgrimage.2. On 8th instant I inspected seven of the party, the others had dispersed into the surrounding villages. 3. This party had been 40 days on the road, had tramped all the way, and were all fit and free from any ailments. 4. This was the party the Russian officer had caused the trouble about during his visit to Sehkuha mentioned in last letter. 5. Reported to authorities my inspection, mentioning to the Mulla that they might be permitted to proceed ; objections on part of officials raised, but the head Mulla supported my representations, and told Sartip and others what 1 maintained was quite evident, viz., that any one who had gone through 40 days , severe trials and hardships in this weather, walking all the way from Quetta, had been practically 40 days in quarantine and could not communi cate disease. 6. The men I learn were permitted to proceed after a few days' detention. 7. Another kafila from Quetta (Baluchis) and also one from Jalk arrived at Killa-i-Nao who were also inspected and found fit; these were not interfered with, the Russian officer having left the country. 8. The Russian officer’s dak has not yet been recovered, nor has there been any trace of the dak runner. 9. The officer, I learn, is to remain at Birjand for an indefinite period. 10. The Russian tents reported as being seen near Farrah have turned out to be those of Afghan troops recently arrived, some as increase to the garrison, and the others for purpose of conveying the families of Syed prisoners to Kabul. 11. Some 25 Hazara Syeds of the same party, who had escaped into Seistan, appealed to me to move the British Government in their behalf, as their fellow-men and relations were now being slain by His Highness the Amir—the servant of the British Government—and others were being kept in prison in Afghan territory. 12. On the 13th instant, consequent on the extreme heat affecting both men and horses and a paucity of grazing, 1 split up my party putting the escort in camp at Killa-i-Nao where there were ample supplies to be had and good grazing, and moreover, all inhabitants being Balucb, most friendly disposed and ready to bring all supplies. 13. Accompanied by the remainder of the party, I proceeded due north from the capital, moving along the bank of the Hamun where ample grazing was free to all comers. 14. This enabled me to mix freely with nomad encampments from all parts, treat their sick, and cement friendly relations with them, and at the same time to visit all the villages on the outer circle, as 1 had, while encamped at Nasratabad, compiled statistics of all villages and towns within a radius of 10 to 15 miles of the capital. 15. Arriving at Guzbar to the north-east, I left ray camp by the bank of the river, and with a few attendants I crossed both arms of the Helmand, and, proceeding on foot for three marches, visited the towns on the Perso-Afghan frontier, and ascertaining that there was no truth in the report made by the Hussian officer to the Seistan authorities that plague had appeared at Kandahar, Farrah, Chakansur, etc. 16. We were well treated by Sardar “Khan Jahan” and the “widow” of “ Sardar Muhammad Sharif,” two influential and more or less independent parties (Baluch) on the frontier. 17. They supplied us not only with horses and guides, but daily sent cooked mimanie for the entire party. 18. Both these Sardars were well known to Sir R. Sandeman and had been on the Goldsmidt Boundary Commission, and are most loyally disposed to British influence. 19. It was a pleasing trip amongst hospitable friendly people in comparison to the sour faces and unfriendly feeling ot many of the Parsiban towns we had passed through, and every assistance was given us to complete the statistics of these parts right up to Milak where I had previously visited. 20. We reached camp here on 29th instant finding all well, and much improved in tone and health, the climate being much more salubrious than the bare plain at Nasratabad. 21. These tours, which alone keep the party fit in this country and heat, enable me now to complete a detailed account of all available supplies, etc., every head of cattle, sheep, horse, donkey, etc., and to supplement and verify by personal observation each detail which had also been otherwise compiled while halting. 22. In addition we were able to treat a large number of sick, get much useful information from patients and others, visit the chief Sardars of all Baluch tribes, and those from within Ghain who graze here at this period of the year, and thus cement friendly relations with desirable parties, explain the trade facilities now opened up, and above all show ourselves to the people, speak our politics openly, and defend ourselves from the calumnies and misrepresenta tions of the northern rival and the Persian officials, who, without any doubt, are averse to our interests spreading in the country, and who, through the Governor of Birjand and right-hand man of the young Sartip here, are working dead against us in every possible way.23. The Governor of Birjand being in the Amir’s pay and the garrison being supplied by him, he has much to do with affairs in here and many questions are referred to him for decision ; in fact, every one is working witli the elder brother at Birjand, who is at enmity with “ Ali Akbar Khan/’ the Governor oE Tabas and Seistan, to bring about his overthrow. 24. Ali Akbar Khan was well spoken of by Lieutenant Napier in his tour here and bis sympathy with the British Government, whereas the contrary is the case with his brother, Ismail Khan. He is the Russian main prop, and he and his gang assuredly work hard in the interest of their employers. 25. The Russian news-writer is a great thorn in our side, and sets afloat all sorts of wild rumours to our disadvantage, which, however, all come back to our ears, and we are thus able to act on the defensive. In fact, the officials here, or rather Birjand, are a bit tired of our presence and stay; as it was thought the withdrawal of the Russian officer would be followed by the withdrawal of the British officer and party also. 26. But our presence and the fact that we are very acceptable and made much of by all Baluch Sardars and Arab officials does not meet with favour in the eye of the Parsiban. 27. Some obstacles about supplies, etc., have been put in our way, but we have without much difficulty surmounted all, and have many staunch friends and supporters in the country ; to retire in the face of Parsiban wishes would be very weak. Our stay in face of official dissent is a source of much astonishment and will bear good fruit throughout the country. 28. Up to date we have had no communication from the Agent to the Governor-General, Meshed, and doubtless my two “ test-letters” have not reached him, and if so, replies may have met a similar fate to the Bussian dak. 29. It was reported throughout the country yesterday that Barki Dad, Pishin trader, whom we met on return from here, had been plundered by Damini Baluch, and that Lieuten ant W. Ware having heard of it had sent men in pursuit who caught the culprits near Mir Jawa, receiving back the stolen property and handing over for disposal the prisoners to the Chief. 30. The Mujtabid (head priest) received a letter on 15th instant, reporting that Asaf- ud-Daula, Governor of Khorasan, had lost his Governorship, having been dismissed in consequence of misappropriation of moneys belonging to the shrine. 31. The newly appointed Governor Rukn-ud-Paula has not yet arrived from Meshed having been specially deputed by His Majesty the Shah to deal with the Tabas murder affair. 32. The head Mulla of Banjar secretly reported to me that he has it on most reliable authority that the Shah is all and all with the Russians, and that Russian troops have leave to move slowly into the country, so as not to create suspicion amongst the Powers. 33. It is with satisfaction I have to report that notwithstanding intense heat by day- in tents 105°, in open 108°, ground radiation varying from 110°—124°—the entire party are still quite healthy and going strong. The horses and camels, too, have pulled up wonderfully on grazing, after severe trials and rapid march over intervening deserts. 34. This healthy state is, I attribute, due to leading an open air life with suitable occu pation, and is a safeguard against disease, the outcome of apathy and ennui. 35. Two Kad Kudas of the neighbouring villages, who amongst others have received strict orders not to supply anything to the British officer and his party, have come into camp this mornino- as also four Baluch merchants. The former say they do not mind the Sartip s order: they will bring me at night any supplies I may require, and have even now brought us presents of grapes and melons. 36. The latter are willing to supply us at any time when we require it, and two Chiefs, Baluchi, have sent to say they will send the officer and their brother Muhammadans of his party as much supplies as the officer wishes to order. 37. There is every reason to suppose that the order issued does not come direct from the Sartip himself, but that those acting in interest of Russians, viz., Ali Tar Khan, Naib-ul- Hakmut, and Birjandi officials, are issuing the orders to the Kad Kudas round the country. Beyond the fact that money is running now very short, we are perfectly happy and want for nothing. Ko. 1666-C., dated Camp Ziarat, the 20th August 1897. From—H. S.

Gasfandar came to me reporting that in October last a Seistan Kafila of theirs bad a row with me of Imam Bakhsh, Sarpara tribe, near Konak, and that his cousin, “ Amir” son of Dost Muham mad, who accompanied the Kafila as guide, was shot by the Sardar’s men. n* F v &gt;rl fii C0En P la *“ an *'’ s state ine n t it appears that the Sardar’s men demanded octroi which the Kahla men refused to pay, having, as they state, heard that the Supreme Govern ment had caused all remission of octroi into Quetta, and further told them “ that if they could show any Government document authorising them to recover octroi,” of course they would pay it, but otherwise would not; the altercation waxed warm, whereupon they shot Mansur Khan s cousin, the guide. sul (10) Mansur Khan and his people sought permission from me to be allowed to proceed in force against the Sardar to have vengeance and satisfaction. (11) It was explained to him that it was not possible for me to give him permission It cause a breach of the peace and violate laws within British dominions, and if he persisted he seemed disposed to, in his rash act, he would get into trouble. He then craved permission to be allowed to proceed to Quetta to prefer his claim, which permission was granted and •. letter given for presentation to the Governor-General's Agent on arrival. Complainant further states his cousin was taken to the Hospital in Quetta where he died, and that the case was reported at the time to the Quetta Police authorities. (13) Tliere are numerous applicants seeking permission from Government to be allowed to re-excavate the old karezes at Robat, Kirtaka, Sindak, etc. This man “ Mansur Khan ” is amongst tlie applicants and is prepared to open Kirtaka karez if Government will ao-ree to take one-tenth of the produce as Government revenue after the lands have been 5 made £ U11; u r £ 1 U1 0 •(14) The re-establishing of those karezes and cultivating: in their vicinity are very important matters for consideration of Government. In here (Seistan) the export of grain for sowing purposes being entirely in the hands of official authorities, and the fact that there is not a town or village in the country where one thousand maunds or less could lie had in time of need leaves our frontier post solely dependent on the good will of the authorities. It would therefore appear to be a matter of very considerable importance to have those of our levy posts self-supporting where possible, which appears only too self-evident from information received, and the desire now of many to be allowed to reopen and cultivate since security of property is guaranteed by boundary demarcation. (15) In case pressure be brought to bear by our northern rival, and Persian officials acting in the interest of this rival, a not at all unlikely contingency, all supplies for our thauas and other purposes would have to he brought from Nushki and Quetta at considerable delay, and furthermore could not be delivered at a less rate than from 4 to 5 seers per rupee. Whereas locally and in the vicinity of our own post they can, it appears, be grown within a few years, and from information received it is stated the crops produced can be compared with any grown in Seistan. (16) Last week one of the levy posts from Robat tbana was found by us away in the heart of Seistan, three marches from the border an^ seven from the post. What business he had at Iskil I do not know; he appeared to be doing himself hand some riding round the country on a Government camel, no doubt on the plea of purchasing grain for the thana, but as any quantity of flour can now be got quite close at Hussainabad, Sekuba or Daulatabad on the border, there appeared to be no urgent reason why he should strike so far up country. Anyway it remains patent enough that even now, with no Kafilas running, all that happens along our line is brought iu and retailed throughout the country by these men. This man had brought intelligence and had told people of Iskil, who informed my party, of Damni's raid and the action taken by us also; that “ Ido' and others had been dismissed from their posts by Mr. Barnes and others placed in their post, etc. Of course I cannot vouch for the truth of those rumours; they may or may not be the case. It only goes to show that the officials at Robat Thana do not carry out Lieu tenant *Webb-Ware's orders and are unreliable and wander all over the place on riding camels. Even this man's own house is at Hussainabad, I learn; it may be that they are vying with each other as to who can completely a spoof ' the other in supplying general information for the Birjand-Seistan Daily Chronicle, and journey onwards to help the Russian news-writer to complete his despatches. The question then arises, is it desirable to have Seistan-Baluch residents of country there at all, as posts, or whether it would not be better to rely on our own men who are in no way connected or in sympathy with the pestilential intriguing inhabitants. One level-headed man, as previously suggested, at this post seems desirable. I am unable to carry out orders regarding the despatch of accounts as F desired by the Government of India conse- Tlhs has been forwarded.^ ^ ^ quent on not yet having received the budget estimate. I request you will be good enough to expedite the despatch of this document to enable me to comply with No. 869-F., dated the 8th April 1897, and so prevent arrears of accounts and much difficulty in adjustment. Not havino* received anv communication from the Agent to the Governor-General, Khorasan, in reply to my letters, it is imperative that some money be sent me on receipt of this, as by the time it reaches you I will be completely empty handed. If I have to get supplies on “ tick ” it will lead to very bad impressions, and will get into the Meshed press through Russian news-writer—a most undesirable thing. An escort of four men with Jemadar from each Thana will, I should say, under Lieutenant Webb- Ware's orders, be easily able to convey sufficient money within fifteen to twenty days from date of receiving this application. No. 5, dated Camp Kosha Pain, Seistan, the 14th July 1897. From —Subgeon-Majob G. W. Bbazibb-Cbeagh, A.M.S., To The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, Simla. In continuation of previous reports I have the honour to forward herewith despatch Mo. 5, with full particulars of present affairs as they stand now. 1 2 (1) Affairs are now much quieter here, the only ember now remaining after the cessation of the fiery condition hitherto prevailing is in the person of Mirza Rahim Khan, Russian news-writer. ( 2 ) Sardar Purdil Khan, Sarbandi, who has for some months past been with the Gover nor, Mir Ali Akbar Khan, at Tabas, has returned with khilats and honours, and brings the following intelligence.40 (3) Mir Ali Akbar Khan had not to go to Tehran as invited in connection with the mur der of “ Darwesh Khan,” having squared matters in the usual style. The order stating he was not now required at Tehran, which had been sent on receipt of the usual peshkash at the Imperial Treasury, was to the effect that he need not trouble now to come to Tehran ; and in addition the said order gave Mir Ali Akbar power to punish, in any way he considered fit, those who showed him any rebellion in his country. It is reported that the above is a great disappointment to Mir AH’s enemies at Birjand. (4) Purdil Khan has also brought a copy of the orders of His Highness the Shah re-open- Denied by Sartip when spoken to about putting routes, with diiections to the Sartip to obstacles in my way when carrying out His Highness give publication to them throughout Seistan. the Shah’s orders by agreement with the Powers. (5) There are numerous applicants * seeking permission from Government to be allowed to re-excavate the old karezes at Kistaka, Sindak, Amir Chah, Robat, etc. * “ Baloch.” (6) The re-establishing of these karezes and cultivation in the vicinity of our thanas is in the opinion of the writer, an important matter for the consideration of Government and has been reported in detail to the Agent to the Governor-General, Baluchistan, (7) It is reported that Russian troops have reached Ghain, that they come iuto the villages, and that no obstacles are put in their way in crossing the frontier. (8) The Governor of Birjand has generally sanctioned the Ijaras for this year’s crops earlier than usual, to afford the Russians an opportunity of purchasing grain in Ghain. (9) Last week the Russian news-writer received a letter from the Russian Doctor that he was to explain to the Sartip that he (Russian Doctor) had reported to the Russian authori ties that the British officer had been allowed to remain in the country, and that he (Russian news-writer) was to work so as to drive us out of the country. (10) This is why obstacles were put in our way last week and all supplies stopped by order of officials, which difficulty now happily has been smoothed over and all supplies are forth coming. (11) There is every reason for believing that this is not the doing of the Sartip himself or his mother, but has been the outcome of plots hatched against us by the Naib-ul-Hukmat and the news-writer, who apparently are working hand and glove with the Birjand officials agaiust British prestige and against the power of Mir Ali Akbar, the Governor of Tabas and Seistan. (12) It is a strong policy of the Russians to get hold of these two men, and with liberal distribution of peshkash, etc., at Birjand they have secured the influence of the Sartip’s rio-ht- hand man, viz. y Naib-ul-Hukmat, and things are worked by him as if emanating from°the Sartip. (13) The Sartip’s mother is a most shrewd and business-like clever woman, but as far as possible things are concealed from her too and I have every reason to suppose both from her letters and actions that she is most favourably disposed toward us. (14) The plot anent the order issued to all Kad Kudas not to supply our camp not having succeeded as anticipated, a much more serious one was set on foot which came to my notice through Mulla Muhammad Raza’s kindness and generosity. (15) The Kad Kuda of Ramak was for three days in Nasratahad staying with the parties above referred to (officials) and came back having secretly arranged the following plot “ He was to get some 15 badmashes of villages who were to take with them some women at midnight, and, when near our camp, the women were to cry loudly for help where upon the men were to come up and all create a great row and say the British soldiers had got hold of the women, so as to report to the Mulla and people, and try to drive out the British officer and his men in disgrace from the country.” (16) On hearing this, I immediately made all necessary arrangements in camp for any surprise and rode into the village square, called the Kad Kuda and people and told him straight what 1 had heard, cautioning them “ that now he and his men could come when they liked, but that the first man we saw near camp I should fire on him straight, and that the bloodshed would be at his door.” They showed rather a sullen front, but the threat had its effect for we were unmolested after that, though all supplies were cut off. (17) On personal representation and communications passing between Sartip and myself, all difficulties have ended and supplies, etc., are all forthcoming. (18) As yet I have not heard from the Agent to the Governor-General, Khorasan, so I conclude my letters never reached him ; this is getting serious, for 1 am running short of money and we cannot get on here without it. (19) In another 10 days when the greater heat subsides, I propose putting the escort in camp at Rohat with suitable supplies, and proceeding with a small party to Tahas to see Mir Ali Akbar and learn more of Russian politics at Birjand, etc., etc. (20) It is reported that they (Russians) are working hard to establish themselves both at Birjand and Kerman, so as to command the Bandar Abbas-Kerman-Khorasan trade route.z 41 (*2l) I hear Lieutenant Sykes has left Kerman, and if this be so and no one is there to represent us they have every chance of doin# so, which will conshlerably affect our prestige, as there are 63 Hindu merchants in Kerman, who look to us to protect their rights, as also a very large number at liandar-Abbas who are Ftrfe pages 131, 134 and 135 of my previous report, sufficiently hard pressed by Persian 1893 and 1894. officials when occasion offers. (22) It may seem a far cry from Bandar-Abbas to Kandahar, Chakansur, Lashjuwaim Farrah, and Herat; nevertheless, Kafilas ply between these places and our Bandar-Abbas goods reach the Amir's territory through Seistan from this port, via Bam-Narmishir and Nasratabad, Daulatabad, Burj-i-Kolina-Siaduk, etc., and so onwards ; it will be clearly obvious to any one reading between the lines of the translation and rules regarding sanitary posts, on the frontiers of Afghanistan and Baluchistan, whose the master hand that drew up these rules, particularly as regards routes Nos. I and II and the clause in (2) that not a single soul shall cross except by these routes. (23) The above noted order practically stops all Afghan trade coming south through Seistan and seeks to drive it into the hands of the Governor of Birjand, the leader of the Russian political regime and for years a well-known protege of that party. (24) This, if overlooked and not represented both at Meshed and Tehran, will injure our trade considerably, besides damaging our prestige ; for all throughout the country, Baluch, Afghan, Ghaini, Khorassani, etc., are well conversant with the present political situation, and the activity with which the Russians are pushing on their influence throughout the country under the mantle of “ commercial enterprise.' They even go so iar as to ask why the Sarkar permits it—a question of considerable significance. (25) If we neglect the Bandar-Abbas route in favour of our newly-acquired Quetta- Nushki one, it will give our northern rivals every opportunity to acquire a locus standi further west and south, and it is quite possible with their influence now so secure at Tehran they may again press the present “ Monarch ” to concede them the long-coveted prize, viz., a port on the Persian Gulf. Vide previous report of mine, 1893 and 1891, page 79. (26) Our present line of policy would appear to be to awaken to these facts and check as far as possible such designs by having a representative at Kerman, who could, during the Kafila season, tour down to Bandar-Abbas, and another at Birjand or Seietau, or yet on our own Baluchistan frontier, who could likewise come in here and keep ou terms of friendship with the local officers, watch our trade and how affairs proceeded. (27) That the Russians have secured a firm footing already in Birjand and in Seistan as aforementioned is very evident. And that Naib-ul-Hakmut and the news-writer are doing our cause serious damage is beyond the possibility of doubt. (28) The fact of my remaining in the country against—as is supposed—the direct wish of all parties, and moreover getting as much supplies as we require secretly from various quarters and friends, is not without its good results and greatly pleases the Baluch and other elements who have no sympathy with Parsiband rule or the interference of the Amir Panj (Governor of Birjand). (29) This has spread into Sarhad, etc., and I have had letters from old friends there, viz. Governor of Sarhad and Barapur, also from Ladfs showing their desire to help me and hoping I will come back that way and see them. (30) I attach a copy of a letter, which came into my possession, from the Lady Ali Akbar Khan (the Sartip's mother) to her husband at Tabas, a perusal of which will show why 1 took a trip to the frontier across the Parun and Helmand, also showing how the rights of water-supply are a subject of discussion, and how the Russian news-writer is busy here stirring up strife and poisoning the Sal-tip's ear with false report about “ encroachments of the Amir's tribes who is a servant of the British, but does not mind their orders,' etc., etc., etc. (31) The Helmand having during the last two years changed its course altogether, leaving the Afghan side and now running west of Milak, whereas it ran east of it before, will cause a paucity of water to flow to the Afghan territory. This may be a bone of contention later on, as the Persians now have the major portion of supply. Our friend, the Russian news-writer, has made himself acquainted with this and his actions may cause trouble. I purposely visited this place, carefully mapped and noted situations for future guidance when this letter and other information came into my hand. _ _ . ... „ . . (32) As far as 1 can learn, the Biriandi policy, Colonel M.S. Bell, V. C., mins “Notes on a, journey , \ d of nourse bv Russian intrigue is the from Quetta to Trebizond,” sounded the trumpet-note backed Ot COU S0 oy rtUSSian intrigue, IS tUe of warning in his preface, page x. His advice and incorporation Oi Seistan With GhaiU at a no warnings are sound in every particular. distant date. (33) The Governor of Birjand has got no son to succeed him and this is one of the real causes that has made him so jealous of his brother “ Mir Ali Akbar Khan ' of Tabas, who has several sons and family to succeed him in Tabas and Seistan. Ismail Khan also knows that as a matter of law his own hereditary rights in Ghain have, in case of his death, to go back to his brother and his family after him. Having spent most of his years in Russian pay and favours, he is all the more anxious for one of his brother’s sons (legal heirs) to follow him after his death. Consequently the young Sartip here is u shadowed ' and everything done to p42 wean his affections from his father to his uncle, and he is surrounded by Birjandis, so that when in a few years he becomes independent (as his appointment to Sartip here is by Royal Grant at the request of his father), the said incorporation may accordingly be brought about. (Si) The appointment of Alla Yar Khan as Naib Hukmat in Seistan, with the sanction of the Shah at the instigation of the Governor of Birjand, simply meant that the boy (Sartip) must be brought up under the training of a man in Russian pay. (35) My notes in the month of May from Nasratabad will throw some light on the facts that Ali Akbar Khan himself is trying to depose the Sartip (his son) and put in another son, by a siga wife, in his place to check this very arrangement of his brother and his party. (36) Sardar Syed Khan himself (chief of Naroi and most influential Sardar here) told me in conversation to what an extent he was annoyed with his sister (Sartip’s mother) and the Naib-ul-Hukmat, who are the combined rulers of Seistan, and that Ali Akbar Khan was doubt ful of his wife’s conduct and management of Government, with her son in Seistan. (37) The natural rivalry between co-wives of Ali Akbar Khan has led the Sartip’s mother to believe that with her husband, who has not seen her for some years, her son, the young Sartip, is not the favourite son. (38) Far be it from me to cast one suspicion of a blot on the character even of a Persian lady, but “ Mother Grundy ” makes free use of this lady’s name {viz., the most beautiful mother of the Sartip as she has been styled) coupling it with that of the Naib-ul-Hukmat, (39) The whole lines of policy regarding Seistan, etc., it will be seen by my despatches, are now very fairly filtered out, and from the translation relating to the Shah’s orders it appears pretty evident that Ismail Khan &amp; Co. of Birjand will now step into the “strong boots” of the Amir of Afghanistan and stifle all Khorassan-Afghan-Seistan-Quetta trade as the Amir has hitherto done. (40) The Indian trade which found its way to Meshed and Khorassan rid Bandar Abbas, Y'ezd, and Kerman, as also that which came from same port into Seistan and Afghanistan via Rudbar, Regan, Bam, Namisher, and Nasratabad, will be completely in the hands of “ Birjand &amp; Co.,” who will also “ block ” our Quetta-Seistan-Khorassan trade and thus cause incalculable damage to our prestige. (41) It is generally reported here now that the authorities at Birjand and Seistan will keep all orders referring to the re-opening of routes secret as long as they can, in order to sell passports and direct Kafilas according to their own wishes. (42) In order to check this, I have promulgated verbal information to all local merchants regarding these orders. Yesterday in reply to my request asking the Sartip now to issue orders in accordance with the instructions of the Shah for the reopening of the routes, he denied having received any orders and stated he could not open the route until he had received such an order, denying or rather concealing the receipt of the order which Purdil Khan had given him on arrival from Tabas. Our trade routes are bulwarks of British liberty and ought never to be allowed to decline or be interfered with. It is with pleasure I have to report continued good health of the party. We want for nothing excepting a little less heat and a trifle more money. P. S. —May I request you will be so good as to keep a copy of all my despatches that I can have access to same on return, to enable me to complete my report. The paucity of clerks, heat, and surroundings, in the narrow limits of a Kabul tent are not conducive to office work. No. 43, dated the 12th Shawal 1314=15th April 1897. From—The Ladt Axi Akbar, To—Her husband, the Governor Of Tabas. Willi compliment* {endearing ).—It is all well in Kudadad Khan’s territory {i.e., her brother’s son). Pray God, your favours might not lessen always towards us. As regards the wheat and rogan, Tahwildars have been ordered to supply as much as they could, but its despatch is pending owing to the want of camels; because almost all the cattle keeping tribes are out of the country still grazing. In all other respects, all is well in the country and there is nothing particular to bring under your notice except regarding the water of Parian, which once before this has been reported you. (1) The water is very much less this year and it remains to be seen to what extent it will later on affect the country. The channel that goes to Afghan territory from Jahanabad side having fallen in, a very small quantity of water goes to the Afghans.43 (2) Sardar Khan Jahan, in support of the proprietary rights of deceased AH Khan («.*., relative of his, the Sardars, once removed), has repaired the Parun Band for himself. Saltan AH Raza Khan was appointed to repair the band and Abhunzada Bakar AH Kban (i.i?., Governor of Kanga in Afghan territory) had also helped him by the way.* ( 3 ) Dost Muhammad Khan (i.e., brother of Sardar Gul Muhammad Khan of Pulgi) had first intended to excavate a second channel of water for irrigation, but Akhuuzada had stopped it and had not allowed him.f But now he (Dost Muhammad) reported that Akhunzada had consented to allow him to dig a new channel provided no damage is done to the old one which runs into Afghan territory^ ( 4 ) Some time ago Mirza Muhammad Rahim Khan [i.e., Russian news-writer) J had reported that Afghan authorities had made X Showing very clearly Russian intrigue. g()me eneroachments on tbe p a run lands in Seistan territory, so knowing this as important I bring it to your notice. ( 5 ) As regards the murder case at Burg-i-Kohana, the Agha Syed Mir Ali Kad Kuda had not informed anything until it was asked from him and then he came himself and stated the facts that the accused is in his custody and that he had confiscated his property. He also requested that accused might be allowed to remain with him until receipt of orders from you. [ Demi-official. ] No. 6, dated Camp Diwana, Seistan, the 3rd August 1897. From—S uhgeon-Majob G. W. Beazieb-Cbeagh, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. As there is little, if anything, of importance to communicate officially in this dak, I deviate from tbe usual official style. (1) Things are now quiescent here as the weather has a depressing and very subduing effect on the Persian official, and since the receipt of further orders from head-quarters anent the re-opening of all passages under my jurisdiction with distinct orders to all officials from the Deputy Governor-General of Khorassan, “enjoining them not to hinder, under any circum stances whatever, the traffic of travellers or the quarantine duties under my charge,” I am left a free hand to go where I like. ( 2 ) The orders from Colonel Yate and also from Simla regarding these matters have been so delayed in sending me, I have had to act entirely in every matter in the best possible man ner a discreet intelligence suggested, and had I only been armed with these clearly defined orders of the Shah, etc., much of my anxiety and labour would have been lessened. ( 3 ) Indeed it was only last week I got the copy of Shah’s orders anent quarantine rules, and yesterday only received Yate’s letter, dated 28th May, with the more recent rules issued. ( 4 ) It is a capital thing to have been able to effect the opening of trade route on our side and arrange things at Tehran satisfactorily and urgently as 1 pointed out in secret despatch to you/ It spread^like wild-fire all over the country that the British Sarkar had re-opened routes and with the withdrawal of Bussian Doctor and my continued stay in the country it has also gone abroad that the Russian Officer had also to leave the country by British Sarkar’s order. Such things have a wonderful effect on the ignorant inhabitants far and near. ( 5 ) Yate mentions in his last that there w^as a proposal to despatch a Captain Bendereff and Doctor Miladchewske from Birjand to enquire into the arrangements here which has been met with protest on our side ; this is well. The influence and reports of their Russian news- writer amf the assistance—strong—very, of Amir Panj, Governor of Birjand, are opposing forces quite strong enough against us. As pointed out from the very first arrival here, the activity and intentions of our rival are considerable, and during wanderings round the country and intervals snatched from professional application and research, l have been able to worm out and unearth a good deal and lost no opportunity to push the British interests in every con ceivable manner as quietly as possible. ( 6 ) We ought, I think, as pointed out in my last, to carefully watch proceedings at Bir- iand and KernTan. The plague scare is a complete blind, the Russian Officer absolutely did nothing during his stav here regarding plague, and probably did about as much during bis stay at Birjand. What other duties he and the Russian Captain have pursued 1 am in ignor ance of as one of my most useful S. S. men has been taken off to Birjand under suspicion, and this man used to furnish me with all their doings. Doubtless Yate is keeping a close eye on them. * 2f. B. Showing that those on the frontier concert measures with each other in matters of water-supply if only left to themselves. —G. W. Bbazieb-Cbbagh. + In 1882 the Persians falsely complained that the Afghans had drawn off the water at Pandar, and that in conse- the : r i au d was lying waste and the population was dwindling; and in 1884 the Amir of Afghanistan complained the Persians refused to evacuate land north of the Naizar, which led to a request from the Shah that this clause he reconsidered: but the Viceroy of India has always strongly deprecated any change, and indeed stated that the Government of India will not be answerable for the conduct of the Amir of Afghanistan if the award be not maintained in its strict geographical accuracy. (Vide Lieutenant the Hon’hle H. D. Napier’s report, page 3.—-B. C.) F 241 (7) There are no Kafilas at all now coming- or going, nor have there been any urgent measures to be adopted since June, as the heat prevents any trade. All will be at rest as^far as trade and Kafila moves till middle or end of October; at this period they begin to start from here and do not return again till end of November or middle of December. Jalk and Nushki Kafilas arrive here, I suppose, about the same time, though many from Jalk come earlier with dates and return with grain, J ( 8 ) It has been intensely hot during July reaching 116 in our tents last week and my camels have suffered severely ; we have lost three and several more are very much like Rosin- ante's mare, “ all skin and bone ” The horses have stood it well, but the flies now are a great source of trouble to all animals and simply devour them if not covered or protected.

Some trouble on the frontier over distribution of water, of which there is a oreat scarcity at this season of the year always, but this year in particular as far as Seistan ha?fared. This is due to the waste consequent on the bursting of the bund which was not properly repaired. The country is now as arid and parched as the Baluchistan deserts the supply of water limited and only got from wells dug in each village or dry beds of irrigation canals. On the 2 nd instant the Governor of Killa-i-Kang in Afghan territory appeared with a force of 200 men on the frontier and took by force the water from Karko Shah channel on to the Afghan lands. Officials in Nasratabad were disturbed in consequence and appealed to the Sardars in turn to go there and arrange matters. The Sardars in turn, whose interests were not concerned in that side, made excuses, and eventually Sardar Khan Jahan of Saidak ou the frontier was appealed to, to come to some arrangements with the said Afghan Governor. The matter is yet unsettled and the Governor is reported to have come to Nasratabad on the 7 th about the matter. Reported purchase of ground by Russian authorities between Gulwarda and Chain for purpose of erection of military post, and that the military officers, presumably Captain Ben- dereff, are purchasing and storing grain for this purpose. 1 This purchase is commonly spoken of in the bazars here, as also that the Russians are so jealous of the British post so near at Robat that they seek to establish their post just as near. Also that they and the officials surrounding Sartip have been appealed to, to get the British officer and his party out of the country, as his influence with jeople aud Sardars is haviug a bad effect. 6 The Sardars themselves who are rather pleased at this are my informants and two of them have just returned from a long stay at Tabas and are well in the know on all matters They assure me there is no doubt as to the purchase of lauds as mentioned and for the purpose stated. 1 r A proposal worthy of consideration is to select one or two of the sons of influential Sar dars in here and put them to school at.Quetta. The suggestion has met with approval both by the boys themselves and fathers concerned who are prepared to send their sous each with a servant aud horse, or alone as Governor thinks fit.

Bbazieb-Cbbagh, A.M.S., Officer on Special Duty in Seistan, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, Simla. In continuation of former despatches, I have the honour to forward herewith the latest intelligence. ( 1 ) On my first arrival in the country and while at Daulatabad on 13th May I heard of the murder of Darwesh (beggar) near Neh, at the same time I also heard particulars of the * The purchase of camels for the India Camel Transport.—B. C.45 murder of one Darwesh Khan near Tabas; taking the first case to be the same as the other till lately, the beggar’s death had been quite lost sight of. It now comes to hand the Darwesh (beggar) case is altogether different and the following is a brief account of particulars :— Some 2 ^ years ago a Darwesh came to Birjand, declaring himself to be a newly converted Moslem and told the people he was an Armenian Christian convert, and that as the people of Yazd would not allow him to preach conversion there, he left Yazd and had come to Ghain to permanently establish himself in Birjand if permitted to do so. The Shaukat-ul-Mulk, Governor of Birjand, it is reported, treated him very kindly, and the Birjand people collected a subscription of some 2,000 Krans and gave it to him. For three mouths he lived at Birjand and then suddenly disappeared. During his stay it is said he had been over every inch of Ghain and Neh country, and in March last when on his way back from Neh he was murdered, and the records, etc., found on him were brought to Hyder Kuli Khan, Governor of Neh. It is now said that the supposed Armenian convert was none other than a Russian spy, and that since his murder the Russian officials have, while working secretly, not left a stone unturned to get to the bottom of the murder. In March, on hearing of the murder, the Birjandi people all suspected that the deceased might be the same new Moslem convert. In April a disguised Russian official actively but quietly prosecuted his search in Neh and Birjand, and has now reported the murder to have been perpetrated at the hands of Hyder Kuli Khan, the Governor, who has been charged with the affair, and being summoned to Tehran had left Neh for there on 26th July. The records, letters, etc., found on deceased were also called for, but it is reported they are not forthcoming. (2) A few days ago a messenger from Zil-es-Sultan on his way to Tehran was arrested- He bad in his possession documents of a compromising nature from Zil-es-Sultan to an address in Tehran disclosing a plot to assassinate the Shah his brother. Zil-es-Sultan has, it is further reported, been summoned with all his family to the capital. (3) Nawab Rukun-ul-Daula, the newly appointed Governor of Khorassan and Seistan, is reported to have died on his way to Meshed a few days ago. (!•) On authoritative testimony it has come to my notice that the Russians have sanc tioned 5,000 tumans (Rs. 18,750) to build a pucca residency at Birjand. (5) Mirza Haji Mahomed Khan, Russian news-writer, Birjand, who had gone to Meshed, has not returned up to date. ( 6 ) The Russian weekly Mail from Seistan left on the 18th instant, this time not by ordinary runner, but by special messeuger, with directions not to post at Birjand, but to pro ceed with urgent despatch to Meshed. (7) There are seven entertained employes for the carriage of the Russian dak from here. I can only attribute the foregoing urgency of despatch to the following, as in other respects things are quiet here now. ( 8 ) Haji Muhammad, who was referred to in a previous letter, dated 20th May, as having gone to India vid Seistan and Robat, is on his way back, and last week wrote a letter from Mir Jawa (three stages from Robat east) to one Gbolam Khan in Siadak, warning him to be pre pared to accompany him (the Haji) to Meshed on his arrival. (9) Disputes about the water rights have arisen on the Perso-Afghan frontier. Since the Helmand has changed its bed to that now called the Rud-i-Parun (abrupt-How), there remained but very little water in the old Helmand bed. The people on the west, i.e., Persians, having cut several irrigation feeders from the main canal, as also did the Afghans on the east bank, and the actual amount of water being as above shown considerably diminished, some of the Afghan feeders became useless and supplied no water. Dost Muhammad Khan of Karko Shah had excavated a channel {vide copy of letter of the Lady Ali Akbar forwarded to you) opposite that of Afghan channel which step—as per letter quoted — was tacitly agreed to by Afghans, but at first objected to. Accordingly the rabi season as far as crops were concerned passed off quietly, there being sufficient water then (March) in the river for all parties. Now with the fall in the river the kharif crop of the Afghan naturally suffered, and they stopped Dost Muhammad’s channel, which the latter and his followers very naturally resented. Sardar Khan Jahan whose property abuts on the spot now under dispute being unable to conciliate matters, Akhundzada, Governor of Kang (Afghan), with 200 troops arrived^on the scene and is in camp on the frontier to square matteis, so as not to have the next 3® ar ® ra ‘ n crop a failure. Two other Sardars from here proceeded to the trontier yesterday, each with an escort to arrange a settlement amicably, if possible. I fancy the Russian news-writer now has sent off an exaggerated report on Seistan-Afghan frontier troubles, hence urgency of despatch. (10) A movement is now on foot by Russians for establishing themselves further south to get the Governor of Birjand into trouble.46 Someone has been writing- to the Persian Government authorities at Tehran and Meshed re administration of Ghain by Shaukat-ul-Mulk to the effect that within the past five years he had embezzled 40,000 tumans (Rs. 1,50,000) of revenue monies. In Seistan it is suspected Mirza Haji Muhammad Khan, the Russian news-writer, is the intriguer, and that in consequence he has been summoned to Meshed by Russian Consul- General to explain if the case was prosecuted by the Persian Governor, what evidence in proof of the charge could be produced. ( 11 ) The Seistan officials continue to give effect to the report that the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, Governor of Tabas and Seistan, had written to his son, the Deputy Governor here, to adopt any possible means quietly to get rid of the British officer and his party out of the country, as his influence with the Sardars and respect he showed them would be bad for the country. * (12) This 1 have every reason to believe is a pure fabrication so far as any action on the part of Hashmat-ul-Mulk is concerned ; others doubtless are pressing the point. (13) The Russian Doctor, who was lately in Tehran and who examined the Shah, pro nounced him to be suffering from gouty diathesis and chronic nephitis (kidney disease), and has recommended him to proceed to some well known Spa in Russia to drink the waters. * Doubt less this is the sportsman who drew up that very clearly defined sanitary document particularly affecting the eastern routes couched in the very best of professional phraseology, for as far as my experience goes there is no sufficiently educated Persian doctor capable of doing so. (14) The bad weather is now nearly over and it is getting much cooler. (15) Party all fit and well. (lb) Seistan Kafilas are now preparing to journey to Quetta vid Nushki and jostling one another for passes. One merchant with party of five who has come from xMeshed with horses (native of Dera Ismail Khan) has now been encamped with us for the past three days. I have induced him to remain, so that he may accompany another Kafila from a village close by who have been collecting and packing wool with a view of proceeding there. (17) If a few Hindu traders could be imported, or induced to come in here, like at Kirman, and settle, a brisk trade, I am confident, would soon spring up and we could very easily at a profitable margin undersell Russian goods.

Sardar Purdil Khan reached Siadak on 18th instant accompanied by 70 sowars, and Further development of Perso-Afghan water rights. stated with Saidar Khan Jahan. On the 19th „ instant they moved into camp at Deh Ass, on the Helmand bank opposite where Mulla Fakir Muhammad Akhundzada (Governor of Kang) was camped. A message was duly sent to the Afghan Governor requesting a meeting to which the Akhund replied that he was busy that day with the Kabul dak which had just reached him but would come next morning. * On the 20th the Akhundzada with 40 sowars came over to the Persian camp, and after the usual compliments Allar Yar Khan, Naib-ul-Hakumat, Seistan, delivered a speech to the following effect :— “ All races know that, with the exception of a few plots of ground, the United Kingdom is governed by heretic nations, and that now if they of the Islam nations do not unite to maintain what they had, surely that would also be soon devoured.” All paities of both factions applauded this speech, and unanimously agreed that such petty quarrels and disagreements as the present about water distribution, etc., should never arise between two Muhammadan nations. The Afghan Governor (Akhundzada) replied “that the area under irrigation by the Hel mand in Afghanistan, was as three to one in comparison with Seistan, and that while Seistan only required one share, Afghanistan required three shares. Furthermore, it was entirely through Afghan liberality and kindness that Persia was permitted even the half of the sharethey had, seeing that the Helraand was entirely Afghan. Now you (Persians) are not satis- tied and have taUen advantage of fair and liberal treatment, and want to deprive us (Afghans) of the whole of our waters. The water of the Helmand having changed its flow to Paruu, entirely in Persian jurisdiction, the natural fair distribution should be that we (Afghans) sliould have the entire water in the old Helmand channel and you (Persians) have that in Rud- i-Parun or failing this, let us jointly repair the band at Kohak and bring more water on this side sufficient for both parties.” On behalf of Seistan Sardar Purdil Khan demurred and traversed ttm claim so ably set forth in the above speech by the Akhundzada and said, “ No ! they (Persians) would not join Afghans in repairing what was their own (meaning the baud); we shall excavate a channel within our jurisdiction and you do likewise in yours.” The Afghan leader declined this proposal ^maintaining that the distribution of the water should be regulated at the mouth of the river or he would not allow any excavation of channels.” Sardar Khan Jahan also spoke more or less to the same effect as Purdil Khan, but the Afghan leader remained firm and de bonne grace declined to be coerced. The commission then broke up orderly and the guestio vexata has been referred to the respective Governments. •&gt; Durino' conversation the Akhundzada is said to have mentioned the weakness of the Persian Government in permitting Russian and British officers to wander in the country. 3 On the 22 nd my apothecary with escort returned from Birjand, where they had been for some 13 days awaiting despatch and money from Consul-General, Meshed. ° The money reached me safely and my party returned all right after an absence of exactly month 4 The following is a brief summary of events in Birjand {as reported by my apothecary) •md o-ives corroborative evidence of information previously forwarded to you. it nommon report in Birjand bazars that the Persian Government have written to the ^ 1 P .

The Russians wro e a s v i c i n ity of Herat to the west somewhere between it and Turbat-i-Haidari and also sent presents to him. It is reported he retained Russian request to the Amir of Afghanistan and Mission to Kabul. the presents and declined the proposal.48 Doubtless the Russian Mission under Major Gromtchevsky (who xvas present on the Pamir Commission and has but recently returned from a mission in Manchuria), that it is proposed to send to Kabul, has some scheme on hand as above noted, that is, if as previously reported they have obtained permission to establish posts and consulships at Birjand and Turbat. 10. A new Russian news-writer has replaced the one recalled to Meshed. 11. Abbas Ali, son of Darwesh Khan, deceased (murdered), had orders from Tehran to proceed to Meshed and report himself to the Rukn-ud-Dowleh who had left Tehran for Meshed. 12. Ali Akbar Khan, Governor of Tabas, it is stated, has also received orders to proceed to Meshed and had left Tabas for that purpose. 13. Bam Narmishu Kafilas are now arriving for purchase of grain, as it is reported there is a great scarcity in that district this year, consequent on a visitation of locusts which have destroyed all the crops, 14). I bought some good camels from that district at very reasonable rates to replace those that had died. 15.

On the night of the 25th instant my post at Girdi (38£ miies north from Robat Attack on Her Majesty’s Royal mail post. Thana) was attacked by Afghans (so men report, as they spoke lu Pushtu only) who beat the levy sowar runners and guide severely, looted the Government camel, also saddle, saddle bag, all the men’s clothes, sword, flour, barley and wheat and money they had on them. Having taken away the camel and things to a distance they left the men free and proceeded east across the desert, where these tracks were visible next morning on the sand. Of course the men were powerless and could do nothing, being attacked at midnight, but fortunately the Robat Levy, runners and guide arrived at 9 o’clock next morning bringing the dak and relieved them ; all arrived in camp safely yesterday morning somewhat the worse for the conflict, showing abrasions and wounds, the result of ill-treatment. The weather being now cooler, arrangements are being made to guard the post with cavalry escort to prevent any repetition of the occurrence. 17. The party, with the exception of a few cases of fever consequent on change in weather and cold nights, continues to maintain good health. G. W. BRAZILR*CREAGH, Surgeon-Major, A.M,S.

I have the honour to inform you that absence outside the safe limits of my dak arrange ments, together with serious illness which prostrated me for some ten days, prevented my communicating with you during the past month. In the notes embodied and forwarded herewith will be found particulars of events since last communication. Dated Seistan, the 5th October 1897. 1. For past weeks I have been making a reconnaissance and survey of the mountainous district to the west of Seistan. 2 . This district has an important strategical bearing on the defence of Seistan and w;is considered of considerable importance by the late Mr. N. Elias. As owing to various causes Lieutenant the Honourable H. D. Napier, during his tour through the country in the winter of 1892 and 1893, was unable to carry it out, I deemed it advisable before the recall of the Mission to explore and survey this country, which has now been completed49 % 3. The Perso-Afghan Commission which had met on the frontier to arrange water distribution has settled the matter amicably. Sardar Purdil Khan Singarani, one of the principal Seistan Sardars, is now at Kohak with some 500 men repairing the broken band in order to bring water into the country which has been completely dry for past two months. 4 . This band was neglected last autumn, causing but a paucity of the water to flow east per the Rud-i»Seistan, in consequence of which the crops on south and south-east suffered considerably. 5 . A meeting of the officials and head mullas of the country assembled lately at Nasrabad to settle some frontier disputes, amongst whom were Sardar Syed Muhammad Khan, Naib Governor of Khang, Khan Muhammad Khan of Chakansur, and the head Mulla of Farrah with others representing Afghan interests. The cases in dispute, which were not of special interest, were all settled amicably, with exception of one, the case of a widow lady, which is still pending. 6 . The head Mulla invited himself to my camp, a distance of 15 miles, with attendants, and spent the day with my party, having been entertained at dinner, etc. He gave much usefulinformation on frontier matters. He did not appear to be aware of the disturbance on the Peshawar frontier and apparently no news of the fight has yet reached this side. 7 . Two large Kafilas with wool, hides, etc., left Seistan for Quetta, one on 5th September consisting of ItTcamels, and the other on 24th September consisting of 40 camels. 8 . There is now no restriction whatever; all routes are open. Kafilas have arrived from Ghani for purchase of grain, as also from Sarbad and Narmisher, etc., with dates and to carry back grain. 9 . There is a tremendous export of grain from Seistan, but much of the surplus grain from Bandar in Afghan territory finds its way in here, being bought by Seistan merchants. 10. Two more large Kafilas are fitting out for Bandar Abbas, but I have succeeded in persuading the merchants of one party to go to Quetta instead, to which they have agieed. 11 With the advent of the cold weather and the fact of Kafilas marching and flocks changing grazing grounds, two gangs of Baluch marauders are on the war path and have committed several murders and looted many ramas. One of the parties crossed our path on the night, 18th September, but I was so weak and orostrated I was unable to follow them; they cleared out rapidly when they heard British troops were near there, we were afterwards informed. These were the very party too who looted my Girdi post; however I have marked them down and know where they came from and hope to recover the loss and indemnity also for assault and injury to my sowars. 12. These parties who hang round the desert intervening between Robat hills and Seistan to attack Kafilas and other helpless flock owners give our Girdi post a wide berth, now that they have heard that British troops are posted there. • The officials in here are much pleased at the example the presence of the detachment there are creating and its effect. The flock owners also are greatly pleased. I had a visit from several of them when visiting the post on the 23rd. 13. I might note the maintenance of this post is rather expensive, being three marches from here and in bare desert. I have to send them all supplies, forage, etc., from here, yet without their presence I could not maintain the dak with any safety. •14. The Farrah garrison in Afghanistan has recently been increased; there are reported to be 1,000 cavalry and the same number of infantry with six guns there. At Gurishak, east of Farrah, there are also one thousand men and six guns. It is reported there are strict orders from the Amir to daily parade and drill the men in the open fields. Last month August, a General Order came from Kabul to the effect that 50 per cent, of the inhabitants of Farrah must come every Friday and be paraded with the State troops, to learn drill. The people sent a petition to the Amir, stating they were prepared to go to war at any time they were required, but prayed to be exempted from these parades as they interfered with their general occupation. It is a common rumour in Farrah bazar that the Afghan troops will some day soon have contact with Russian troops. . . , . 15. The Seistan officials, Sardars, merchants, and people having ezpenenced the dis advantage and loss to themselves arising from restrictions and closing of Indian and other routes, are now very much alive to the misrepresentations made by Russian officers and their 8 16. The Russian and English policy has been thoroughly explained to them, and the fact that all the chief Sardars of the country have openly come to salaam and visit me nu more than one occasion in several eases, have treated my entire party handsomely with cooked rations on each tour and place of halt, clearly proves the true sympathy and feelings of the country. 1068 F.

After compliments.—I vl. reply to your murasla I inform you that I have complied with the orders of my Government, and if you want any more supplies and have got any further orders from your Government I have no objection to supply you, but in case you have none (i. e., orders) you will feel that my Government will object to this and to your remaining in the country and visiting towns. Further, I thank God there is no disease in the country, and it is advisable that you will leave the country, because I think my Government will ask explanation from me. All else is well and I wish you good health. His Seal. No. 3. Translation of a letter, dated the 4th Vfuharram 1315 = 6th June 1897, from SubgeOK-Majob BbazieB'Cbbagh, A.M.S., to the Deputy Governor, Seistan. After compliments .—I am in receipt of your reply to my letter, dated 4th July 1897, and cannot understand your saying “ your Government will object to your giving my party supplies/ , It appears to me your Government will object more because you have not complied with the distinct orders of the Ain-ul-Mulk, Governor of Khorassan, and His Excellency your father, Governor of Seistan and Tabas. You must be aware that we are here by order of joint agreement of His Highness the Shah-in-Shah with the Supreme Government and that I have no desire to prolong my stay in the country except under the orders and instructions laid down by agreement. I cannot therefore understand your saying “ it is desirable for me to leave the country ” when I am ordered to stay, and take all precautions it seems desirable to me to protect the country from possibility of plague getting into and decimating the country. It will be obvious to you that if I stay in one place it is impossible for me to protect the routes on the Seistan, Afghan, and .Perso-Baluchistan frontier, the care of which are in my hands. On hearing from the Russian officer that “he had heard that plague had come into Kandahar, Farrah, etc.,' I proceeded to the frontier to verify the above statement and make the necessary arrangements, but thank God no plague exists in any part of Afghan territory. G 252 I then proceeded here to the southern frontier to examine all Kafilas and parties comma* from Jalk, Sarhad or along the Chagai-Nushki routes. I am thus, you will see, carrying out the orders laid down hy His Highness the Shah-in-Shah and my Government as also the desire of all enlightened Governments to prevent the spread of disease, but your order stopping my supplies is obstructing me in the discharge of my fixed duties. You are aware I require supply daily for my party, and I hope you will now issue orders to all the Kad Kudas to supply me immediately. Excepting this, there is nothing but friendship and good-will between us, all else is well, and I wish you health and happiness. No. 4. Backing out of the difficulty letter. Translation of a letter in reply to the foregoing, dated the 6th Muhnrram 1315 = 8th June 1897, from the Deputy Governor, Seistan, to the British Commissioner. Aflef compliments .—After perusal of your murasala I have come to know its contents. As regards the stopping of supplies for your party, 1 have not issued any orders that nobody must give you supplies.* Had 1 issued such orders you and your companions mioffit have suffered.f As you had no passport from me (I was refused one on application the dav before I started on tour), some of the Kad Kudas might not of course have given you supplies. I have no objection to give you supplies, as since your arrival supplies have been given you, and now this very order is for the Kad Kudas that they must give you supplies. Ail is well and I hope you will keep me informed of your welfare. No. 5. Translation of a letter in reply to the foregoing, dated the 9th Safar 1816 =* 10th July 1897, from StTBGBON-MjJOR Bbazieb-Cbkaqh, A.M.S., to the Deputy Governor, Seistan. After compliments .—Your friend has received your letter notifying the withdrawal of previous orders stopping supplies for which he begs to express his thanks. Such orders caused your friend and his party great trouble as he was forced to wander about to graze his horses and camels when the Kad Kudas refused to sell any grain or supplies, stating your Naib Karbali Mazur had come round the villages with the order issued by your authority. Wishing you great ease and peace and hoping you are quite well as this leaves your friend also. No. 6. Translation of a letter, dated the 22nd Safar 1313 = 23rd July 1897, from Surgeon-Majob Brazieb-Cbeagh A.M S , to the Deputy Governor, Seistan. After compliments .—I am in receipt of the packet forwarded to me by His Excellency your lather from Meshed. It would seem that there has been great delay in the delivery of this letter to me which requires some explanation from you. y I am given to understand you have received a copy of the orders of His Highness the Shah-in-Shah with full particulars of these routes which are guarded and duly supervised by me directing that “ they should be open for merchants and travellers/’ * “ Merchants and travellers proceeding from Baluchistan towards Persia shall be allowed to proceed to their destination at once on being passed by me and shall not be detained or subject to any further ex:imination or restrictions whatever in the interior of Persia. Caravans and travellers proceeding from Persia to Baluchistan via Seistan and Nushki shall n&lt;&gt;t be detained on the frontier nor shall they be placed in quarantine, they shall be allowed to pass at once/ ; I request you will be good enough to promulgate His Highness’s orders to the officials directing them to act accordingly as expressed by His Highness’s order, so that all the Sardars and merchants may know that the routes have all been duly opened by His Highness’s orders so that they may continue to trade and have no further trouble or losses. Hoping you are well as this leaves your friend. No. 7. Translation of a letter, dated the 16th Muharram 1315 = 18th June 1897, from Asad-vlla-Khan Sartio f Khwash, Sarhad, to Scbgbon-Majob Bbaziee-Cbeagh, A.M.S.

Some time back some British officers who had come from Kerman side for demarcation of Mashkel boundary I had made friends with all of them—Colonel Holdich, Colonel Wahab, Captain Sykes, and Captain Kembal. Since their leaving the country I had not heard of their welfare. I hope you will kindly inform me if they are quite well and will give my kind regards to them when you write. Usual endings, Translation of a letter, dated the 2nd Ziqad 1314 = 5th April 1897, from Jahund Khan, Chief of the Damini tribe on the Sarhad and in the vicinity of Mirjawa and Ladis, to Sabdab Pubdil Khan, Sardar of the Sarbandi tribe in Seistan. Muhammad, Jehandad, Zaman and Malik-Zada* accompanied Mir Murad Khan.f I only sent them to check Murad Khan from looting, but he did not obey and swore u that he will go and kill them, loot their flockg and property and carry off their wives and children.” For this very purpose Khan Muhammad with the others were sent to them so that they might not loot the Hashamzais. Khan Muhammad checked them from doing so and Murad Khan with his men came back, and if I might not have sent Khan Muhammad, Murad Khan would have looted and killed all the Hashamzais. After that Nur Muhammad went to Seistan with Kafila (in the Muharram on 12th June 1897) when Mirdad Karim Sultan, who was at the time in Daulatabad, saw him and took him to Syed Ali at Burj-i-Kohna. The Syed made him happy (razi) and now Nur Muhammad reports that some of the looted things have been given back already, the remainder will be handed over to them when any of the Hashamzais came for them. You had better send Mirdad Karim Sultan that we may give him the things back and we will arrange with him about the murder of his father according to the custom of the country. We will give him rifles, a daughter, and Karez water, etc., etc. If he comes and returns unhappy without any decision, then I am guilty of punishment whatever you like. I have no means or desire to disobey your orders, as you are the owner and master of Sarhad too. If Murad Khan does not agree with him (Karim Sultan), I will make Karim happy. Secondly, you have written some cattle and donkeys have been looted. I beg to say I am (literally the orders or rule of Sarhad are not in my hands) not the Governor of Sarhad ; if any other tribe does any mischief, it is all put on the neck of lar Muhammadzais. These cattle and donkeys have been looted by Gumshadzais and we have no relation with these people ; Dad Karim is their Sardar. They are in Sarhad under you and you can enquire from them about it. If it is proved that these cattle and donkeys have been looted by my men, I swear by Hazarat Abas I will pay you double of this loss and I will send my men with the Katila to you for further enquiries,! • These are the men who made the attack on my Girdi post on the night of the 25th August 1897—t't e ppen- dix A in letter No. 10, dated 28th August 1897. f Vide my previous report—A Reconnaissance through Baluchistan and Eastern Persia, 1893-1894, page 60.

I therefore request the favour of your informing me of the fact, your friend is much anxious No. 8. After compliments .—I received your letter stating that I do not obey your orders.
