Its object is £;ai&amp; to be to examine certain ruined palaces and churches believed to have been built by the chief of an Ethiopian expedition sent to the Yemen in the sixth century A* i&gt;# to protect the Christian inhabitants from Jewish oppression. A further object is said to be to buy .’rab norses. -o far as I am aware the exchange of visits has no political significance, though the question of the protection of Yemenis resident in this country still remains unsettled, as reported in my despatch Ho. 17 of ecember 16th 1929.

I replied that we, however, were still in the Yemen, adding that I could not discues the question in detail. He said that the matter would have to be settled between the two Governments and when ll enquired whether any approach had been made to you he replied in the negative, left the suDjeot at this point. 10.
