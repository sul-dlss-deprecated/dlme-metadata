Dear Monsell Darla, Will you please refer to your letter of 28th October, reference PS. 78/3, about the issue of exporl licences at Bahrein and Kotreit^ which you were good to send to Gordon during my absence in New York. After further enquiry into the legal position as regards the issue of export licences for petroleua products at these two places, we are now fairly clear in our minds that it is not possible to proride legal cover for the issue of licences at Koweit and that enforcement of a lionising system at Bahrein at the moment has no lejpl backing, which could only be provided by the issue of regulations tinder the Persian Gulf Orders in Council. You will appreciate that the continuance of the export licensing system without legal oorer causes us a good deal of embarrassment and we regard it as essential that early steps should be taken to adjust the matter. feel for the control hope that As indicated in my letter of 13th October last, we ; that it would be difficult to issue instructions fo continued issue of licences at Bahrein when Mmil A y cannot legally be imposed at Koweit and we should h in the oiromnstanoes your Department would feel able now to agree to the discontinuance of the present arrangements.EXPRESS LETTER [N * B, —This is an ORIGINAL MESSAGE, sent by post to save telegraphic expense and undue use of the wires, but intended to be treated, on receipt, with the same expedition as if it had been telegraphed.
