Vernacular letter from His Highness the Khan to Naib Peer Jan. 2. Substance of Do. in English. 3. Letter No. 1200, dated 2oth August 1870, from Political Superintendent to Capt, Harrison. 4. Letter No. 64 from Captain Harrison to Political Superintendent, dated 19th Aug. 18/0. 5. Reply of Political Superintendent, No. 1206, dated 26th instant. 6. Copy of letter from Political Superintend ent to His Highness the Khan of 27th instant. 2. These papers show, I submit, that matters have gone quite far enough at Khelat, for the present, and that the sooner a complete change is effected, the better for both British and Khelat interests. 3. Indeed to pass over the present instance, after all that has taken place, without immediate notice, would be sure to lead to evil consequences, if it has not already done so. I therefore aim, in the first instance, at tacitly showing the Khan that his present line of conduct, is not likely to produce any but an opposite effect to that intended. After he is convinced of that, I have little doubt but that I can alter the present tone entirely, and be on the best terms with His Highness, without sacrificing any principle worth maintaining. 4, Both the Khan and Captain Harrison Vvould appear from their recent acts to have imbibed the idea that they are alike independent of local authority, and of the customary rules of international procedure. The sooner therefore that they are disabused of such impressions the better for both Governments. I have, &amp;c., R. PIIAYHE, Colonel, Political Supt. Frontier Upper Sind.( 2 ) No. 1200 or 1870. P olitical B epaktment. From, COLONEL U. PIIAYRE, c. b ., Political Superintendent, Prontier LTpper Sind. To, CAPTAIN C. W. HAPvEISON, Political Agent, Khelat. Jacobabad, 25th August 1870. S ir, Two days ago I was a good deal surprised by His Highness the Khan's Vakeel, with the Political Superintendent on the Frontier, announcing to me that he had received peremptory orders from the Khan to proceed to Khelat forthwith. 2. I of course refrain from interfering with His Highness* orders in any way, but not having received any corresponding communication on the sub ject, either from yourself or the Khan, I forward a copy of his letter for any explanation you may have to offer regarding your share in the transaction ; as it would appear from the last para, that the withdrawal is solely on your own account, and if so, you will be pleased to state your reasons for having omitted to address me regarding an arrangement which so nearly affects the efficient performance of my duties in connection with Khelat affairs here. 3. I have been informed that there is an expression used in the 2nd para, which, if not absolutely disrespectful, is still wanting in respect and courtesy to me as an Officer of the British Government holding the principal political charge of Khelat affairs on this border. I merely mention this for your information, and at the same time request that you will not speak to the Khan or any of his officers upon the subject, either of the Yakeel's withdrawal or of the tone of his letter, or of his omission to address me on the subject. I prefer to manage these matters myself at a more fitting time than the present. 4. The young man TJzzeem Jan who has been named to succeed his brother Naib Peer Jan at my Court, is a quiet and inoffensive youth for whom I have a regard, but he is quite unfit from want of health and energy to act as representative of Khelat affairs at Jacobabad, where a great deal of important work is at present going on ; and as the time for your annual de parture from Khelat for the plains is close at hand, and the Khan has( 3 ) announced the inexpediency of liis leaving Kbelat tills winter, I am at a loss to conceive why Naib Peer Jan should be required for duty on your line of inarch, when any Khelat Government Moonshee would have answered your purpose equally well, without so rudely interfering with permanent arrange ments here. 5, Under all the circumstances, therefore, you will be pleased to march with the Detachment of Sind Horse under your command to Jacobabad by route of the Moolla pass and Gundava, leaving Khelat as soon^as your arrange ments can be made, and reporting to me accordingly. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) U. PHAYRE, Colonel, Political Superintendent, Frontier Upper Sind. p. g,— I was about to despatch this letter, when Naib Peer Jan came to inform me that he would not be required to proceed to Khelat as previous ly ordered. This arrangement relieves me from the inconvenience which the order for his removal occasioned me ; it does not however affect the other points noted for your report, except to illustrate in a still stronger light than before the impropriety on your part which I have pointed out, not one line re garding either the order itself or its countermand, having been received from you.

I have the honor to report for your information that on Tuesday, the IGth instant, Ilis Highness informed me that at Sirdar Faquir Mahomed's request, arrangements had been made that Naib Mahomed Khan should accompany him to Kedj, and that Peer Jan, the Naib's son, had been directed to join me with as little delay as possible. 2. Ilis Highness on re-considering the subject, thought that other arrangements could be made, and countermanded previous instructions. 3. An express to this effect was forwarded by the Naib to his son. 4. As far as I can understand Sirdar Faquir Mahomed wishes an ex perienced Revenue Officer placed at his disposal, as also small Detachments of Infantry and Cavalry, to convince the people that they have nothing to fear from Persian aggression ;—further particulars will be given at an early date. I have, &amp;c., C. W T . HARRISON, Captain, Political Ageut ; Khelat.( 5 ) So. 1206 of 1870. P olitical D epartment. From, The Political Superintendent, Frontier UrrER Sind. To, The Political Agent, Khelat, Political Superintendent''s Office, Jacobahad, 26th August 1870. Sir, I delayed three days before writing my letter No. 1200, dated yesterday, in the hope of receiving some explanation from you on the subject of the abrupt withdrawal of the Agent for Khelat affairs from my Court; this morn ing, however, I have had the honor to receive your letter No. 61, dated the 19th instant, informing me that on the 16th idem you learnt from the Khan that he had temporarily removed Vakeel Naib Mahomed Khan from your service, and consequently that he had withdrawn the Agent for Khelat, in attendance on me, to supply his place. 2. If I understand you aright, the Khan made these arrangements with out previously consulting you in any waV* notwithstanding that they materially affected the only two British Officers with whom he has direct dealings- If the case be as I have expressed it, you must yourself have been taken by surprise, and it is no wonder that such a mode of transacting business with His Highness, leads to complications, and gives him false ideas as to his re lative position to the Political Superintendent on the Frontier, and the Agent at his Court, and vice versa. Personal arrangements of the kind under notice, never used to be carried out except by letter to the Officer concerned, or con sultation with him as the case might be, and I shall take a convenient oppor tunity of asking His Highness. not again to withdraw his Agent from my Court without consulting me on the subject. 3. Your letter under reply cancels the post-script to my letter No. 1200, of yesterday s date, and such portions of the 2nd para, as refer to my not hav ing received any communication from you at all, on the subject. 4. I regret, however, being compelled to say that your bare announce ment of the Khan's arrangements, in which you disclaim all share, does not palliate the action of the Khelat Government and yourself, as referred to in paras. 3 and 4, because you knew of them on the 16th instant, in time to have stopped the despatch of the order ; but so far from deeming such to be necessary, you appear to think that the Khan was quite right in first removing your own Agent, then mine, without the least reference to the wishes or con venience of either of us!!—and although you must have known what inconve nience those arrangements would occasion me, you tacitly acquiesced in them, and did not vindicate your own right to have been consulted beforehand !( 6 ) 5. In conclusion, I teg you will bear in mind that the usual rules o f unreserved, frank, and courteous communication between Governments on all matters affecting the interests of each, can never be infringed without sooner or later leading to serious consequences; indeed, Khelat correspondence for t ic last month or so shows that no time must be lost in paying attention to this most important duty, as well as many others.

From the Political Superintendent, Upper Sind Frontier, to His Highness the Khan of Khelat, dated Jacobahad, 21th August 1870. After Compliments.—I am sort$ to hear from Captain Harrison that your Highness cannot come down into Cutchee this season, because I lope to have had the pleasure of seeing your and discussing many matters. I think you are quite right not to come, if you think your doing so would involve any risk to the peace of your Highness' country. I have sent to Captain Harrison to come to Jacobabad upon matters of importance, and as soon as I am able, I will write to your Highness upon the matters alluded to above, I am your Ilighness' real friend, and I need scarcely say that as long as I continue on this border, the mutual welfare of the British and of the Khelat Governments shall command my best efforts. I beg your Highness' acceptance of a new kind of breach -loading pistol, with bullets, which Captain Harrison will shew you the use of. (Signed) R. PHAYRE, Colonel, Political Superintendent, U. S.
