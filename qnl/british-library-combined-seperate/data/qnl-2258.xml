Key correspondents in the file include the Political Agent in Bahrain (Hugh Weightman; Major Reginald George Evelin William Alban), the Defence Officer for the Persian Gulf (Major A C Byard; Major H T Hewitt), and the Air Vice Marshal Commanding British Forces in Iraq (Harry George Smart).Topics covered in the file include:British officials’ efforts to recruit an NCO (Non-Commissioned Officer) qualified in the use of Vickers Berthier guns to train a Bahrain local defence force;recruitment of an LDV Force in Bahrain. The file includes a copy of the public notice issued by the Political Agency asking for volunteers, dated 17 June 1940 (f 33), replies (ff 35-49) from individuals and groups volunteering to the LDV, and a document entitled ‘Formation of the Bahrain Local Volunteer Defence Force’, dated 15 August 1940 (f 54) containing details of training, penalties for breach of rules, medical examination, discharge;correspondence regarding the organisation of searchlight crews, and arrangements for searchlights and other equipment to be dispatched from Iraq to Bahrain;a letter from the Air Vice Marshal Commanding British Forces in Iraq, to the Political Resident, dated 8 November 1940 (ff 64-65), concerning the lack of available anti-aircraft defence equipment for Bahrain; the despatch of a searchlight to Bahrain; and acknowledgement of the ‘serious difficulties’ in the use of British guards recruited by the Company (Bahrain Petroleum Company, or BAPCO) – ‘the use of British Forces at the expense of a foreign company, for the protection of private property’;the disbandment of the LDV as a result of an apparent lack of enthusiasm, and a BAPCO announcement stating that the ‘Company will not be liable for staff employees taking part in Military or Defence duties’ and ‘bonuses will not be paid to them while on such duty’. In a letter to the Political Resident dated 20 November 1941 the Joint Secretary to the Government of India (Hugh Weightman, formerly the Political Agent at Bahrain) expresses surprise at the disbandment of the Bahrain LDV, noting an ‘apparent spirit of apathy and helplessness now obtaining in Bahrain’ (f 82).
