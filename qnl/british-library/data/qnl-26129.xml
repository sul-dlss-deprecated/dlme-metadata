Will you kindly refer to Express Letter from the India Office and your subsequent demi-cfiicial letter to Menon, Nos.P.Z.5302/36, and P.Z.6117/36, dated the 12th August and 8th October, 1936, respectively? 2. The various points mentioned in Sir Bernard Reilly's note, a copy of which was received with his demi-official letter of the 5th May last, have been examined by the Government of India and the whole position will be discussed with Sir Bernard when he visits Delhi in January 1937. In the meantime, I am desired to communicate the views of the Government of India on the points which concern them, viz . Nos.1-5, 10, 12-14, 16, 19 and 22-25. X X X X X (vi) Point 14. Transfer of Government buildings . Point 22. General Provident Fund . These two points have been discussed in the Finance Department memorandum referred to under sub-paragraph (ii) above and the Government of India have nothing further to say regarding them at present.Political Secretary : The Government of India are not proposing to compile a complete 'balance sheet of assets such as v/e are calculating for Burma (or, with modifications, have already applied to Orissa and Sind) and are only taking into account ^obligations of the nature of debt specifically referable to Aden” and pensionary liabilities (see paragraph 4 of P.Z.3598). The only buildings actually taken into account are those of the Posts and Telephones, mentioned in paragraph 8 * of P.Z.3598, v/hich by reason of the commercialisation of the Posts and Telegraphs Department fall within the above definition. All other buildings are to be transferred free of cost and v/ithout any offsetting item in the capital balance sheet (paragraph 14 of P.Z.3598) that it is actually proposed to employ. The argument in paragraph 3 of P.Z.3598 really amounts to saying that these latter buildings may be assumed roughly to be Aden f s fair share of such assets. 4V.&gt; c. THE HESIDENCY, Aden, 5th May 1936. Dear Walton, Will you please refer to Lai thwaite 1 s letter to me P.Z.7877/33 dated 4th December 1933 enclosing copies of my letter of the 10th August 1933 on points arising in connection with the transfer of Aden, and of the minutes of the meeting at the Foreign Office at which my letter was discussed? As it has been proposed that 1 should go to England this summer to discuss details connected with the transfer with the India Office and the Colonial Office, I have prepared a note reviewing the fourteen points that were then discussed, and adding remarks on further questions that appear to me to require consideration and decision before the transfer takes place. I enclose a copy of this note. I also enclose a copy of a draft estimate for Aden (as distinct from the Aden Protectorate) showing probable revenue and expenditure after its separation from India. I am sending a copy of the note and of the draft estimate to the Colonial Office and to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. Yours sincerely, (SD.) B.R.Eeilly. J.C.Walton, Esq. j C.B. ,M.C.,M.A., India oil’ice, London.—■ int ^1* Transfer of Goverment buildings . At the 1933 meeting I suggested that the most satisfactory course would be that all Government buildings should be transferred free by the Government of India to His Majesty*s Government who would, in their turn, transfer them to the new Aden Administration. This procedure would be in accordance with the course adopted with regard to military buildings at Aden ov/ned by the Government of India when the military control of Aden was transferred to the Air Ministry. Similarly when the Air Ministry found that some of these buildings were surplus to their requirements they were returned free of cost to the Government of India, who, in their turn, transferred them free of cost to the Government of Bombay, who handed them over, also free of cost, to the Aden Settlement.(£ ■MMMM r iL^.copy 6 / ‘- ' 'X , (The references in tJa© note below are to the points raised in Colonel Reilly 1 s demi-official letter of 10th August 1933) • Colonel Reilly's d.o. letter of 10th August 1933 was discussed at the India Office on 15th August.
