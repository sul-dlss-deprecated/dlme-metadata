Ms. erroneously foliated beginning on the second folio. Record follows erroneous foliation. Physical description: 7 lines per page; written in early Abbasid script (style D.Va--see Déroche, F., The Abbasid tradition, no. 48) in brown-black ink on parchment. Vocalized with red and green dots. Red, green, and gold medallions mark every ten āyahs. On fol. 11a, about 1/3 of the parchment is missing along the outer edge and has been replaced by laid, Arabic paper. Parchment set within frame of heavy, coated, handmade paper. Decoration: Embellishments on both parchment and paper likely dating from the 16th century. Text has been decorated with gold ground containing a colored floral pattern. Surrounding border on paper consists of a gilt frame, a blue border with gilt flowers, red and green bands, and a floral outer border. Origin: Original text likely from the 9th or 10th centuries (compare with Déroche, F., The Abbasid tradition, no. 48). Decoration likely added in the 16th century.
