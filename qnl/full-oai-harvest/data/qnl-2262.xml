Recommendations to solve the problem include: replacement of the Special Police by an Indian Garrison Company, rejected on the grounds of an overall lack of manpower in the Indian Army; that a one-year contract extension with pay rise be offered to Special Police officers; a transfer scheme to enable Bahrain State Police to transfer to the Special Police (copy of police order announcing the transfer scheme, ff 107-110);in August 1945, correspondence relating to the disbandment of the Bahrain Special Police, including confirmation from the Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO), dated 12 September 1945 (f 120) that the Company has no objection to the discontinuation of the Special Police.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Station Commander, Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Defence Officer, Persian Gulf</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Defence Force</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Military recruitment</topic></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum industry</topic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Security of property</topic></subject><subject><topic>Civil defence</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000032#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000032#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
