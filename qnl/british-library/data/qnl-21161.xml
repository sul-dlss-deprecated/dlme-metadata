THE rules given in this Memorandum apply generally, except as otherwise stated, to documents in the possession both of the Foreign Office and of His Majesty's missions and consulates abroad, but they apply only to such of them as form part of the actual archives and are the property or in the official custody of His Majesty's Government. For certain .special observations concerning documents relating to the interests of private persons which are in official custody, and concerning documents in the personal custody of an official of the ^Foreign Office or of a mission or consulate abroad, see paragraph 21 of this ^iVlemorandum. Again, it may happen that a question arises in regard to a document a copy of which only is in the archives, the original being in the hands of private persons. As to this, and for the inverse case of an official document of which a copy is in outside hands, see paragraph 11. See paragraph 22 for the giving of oml evidence by officials. 2.—(1) The production of official documents may be called for both in disputes between private parties and in civil cases where the Crown is itself a party to the dispute; and also in criminal proceedings (for which see next sub paragraph). The observations contained in this Memorandum apply, except where otherwise indicated, to civil cases where private parties alone are concerned, or where the documents are in the possession of the Crown's opponents in civil litigation or in the hands of private third parties and production is sought by the Crown's opponents. A note on cases to which the Crown is a party and where production is sought from the Crown will be found in Annex I to this Memorandum. (2) In criminal cases in a British court where the life or liberty of a person is at stake, the practice is not necessarily the same as in civil cases (see Duncan v. Cammell Laird, Annex VI). It may not be possible to prevent production of a document and the public intersst may have to be protected by a hearing in camera. The prosecution will, however, be in the hands of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Department can make all necessary representations to him as regards the non-disclosure of documents ©n the ground of public interest. A special case to be noticed (to which the Crown is a party) occurs wheie ^proceedings are brought under the Official Secrets Acts in regard to the unauthorised publication of official documents. In such cases Government Departments may be called upon to give evidence not only as to whether the publication was unauthorised (a fact in itself sufficient to secure a conviction), but also whether it was contrary to the public interest (which may affect the severity of the sentence inflicted). In answering questions as to the public interest in such cases, the principles set out in paragraph 6 of this Memorandum should be applied. A further discussion of this matter, with particular reference to the case of Mr. Compton Mackenzie (see L 5905/5905/402 of 1932), will be found in Annex V. 3. The question of producing official documents may arise in connexion with legal proceedings taking place in the courts of the United Kingdom or in courts abroad. Production in foreign countries (including countries where His Majesty possesses exterritorial rights) is dealt with separately in paragraphs 19 and 20 of this Memorandum. As regards the United Kingdom, the position in Scotland and Northern Ireland is the same as in England and Wales. The production of documents in the possession of the Foreign Office or of His Majesty's missions or consulates abroad may also be required in the courts of other parts of the Empire. It seems doubtful how far, if at all, the production of such documents could actually be compelled by subpoena or otherwise in the case of legal This Memorandum is concerned with the production of documents; but much the same considerations apply, mutatis mutandis, to the giving of oral evidence by officials (see paragraph 22 below). [23898] c*proceedings taking place in a British territory other than the United Kingdom,( J ) whereas, of course, in the case of legal proceedings in the United Kingdom, the Secretary of State is bound to produce, upon subpoena, any relevant official document in his possession production of which would not be contrary to the public interest. Nevertheless, documents should, whenever possible, be produced voluntarily for the purpose of proceedings taking place in a British territory other than the United Kingdom unless there is some objection in the public interest. 4. Subject to the morie detailed observations which follow (see particularly paragraph 6 below), it may be said that the question of producing official documents involves the consideration of two main principles often found to be in conflict: on the one hand, the desirability of furthering the ends of justice, a principle which requires that all relevant material should be made available, and on the other, the necessity of refusing to produce documents containing matter the disclosure of which would be contrary to the public interest. There can be no doubt that in a case of conflict between these two principles it is the public^ interest which must prevail, since this affects the community as a whole, whereas the furtherance of justice in any given case affects, generally speaking, only the x individual parties to the dispute (see Duncan v. Cammell Laird &amp; Co., Annex VI, where L. C. Simon says this in terms). At the same time it must equally be remembered that the Crown is not only the guardian of the public interest, but also, according to the English common law, the fountain of justice. As was stated by Baron Atkyns in a case occurring so long ago as 1667 : ' The King is the fountain and head of justice and equity, and it shall not be presumed that he will be defective in either, and it would derogate from the King's honour to imagine that what is equity against a common person should not be equity against him.'( 3 ) It is, therefore, evident that, unless the public interest would clearly be affected, documents ought to be produced notwithstanding their official character. As a distinguished judge has stated ; ' The privilege is a narrow one, most sparingly to be used.'( 4 ) The same judge( 5 ) approved the passage in Taylor on Evidence^) to the effect that ' the principle of the rule is concern for the public interest, and the rule will accordingly be applied no further than the attainment of that object requires.' From these dicta it seems to follow that the rule is not (as is sometimes erroneously supposed by Government departments) that official documents are 'prima facie privileged, and only to be produced where it is clear both that there is no objection in the public interest and that the interests of justice definitely require production. The rule is rather that, prima facie, official documents a*e not privileged and are to be produced except where the public interest clearly requires that they shall not be; in other words, that except where considerations of public interest exist, official documents are on exactly the same footing as ordinary documents. (The position is explained iri®* this sense by the Lord Chancellor in Duncan v. Cammell Laird &amp; Co.. see Annex VI.) This statement of the position must, however, be read in conjunction with paragraph 6 below, particularly sub-paragraph (2) (iii). 5. Before passing on to enquire for what kind of document privilege can legitimately be claimed in the public interest, it will be convenient to notice a ( 2 ) The position is that a writ of subpoena does not ordinarily run, and cannot be served outside the jurisdiction of the court by which it is issued. In the case of the United Kingdom, however, provision is made in various statutes whereby writs of subpoena issued in one part {e.g., Scotland or Northern Ireland) can be made effective in other parts. But no such procedure appears to exist as between the United Kingdom and other parts of the Empire, and naturally no court outside the United Kingdom could compel the production of documents in the possession of one of His Majesty's missions or consulates in a foreign country. In point of fact, it is difficult to see how production of this latter class of document could be actually compelled even in the courts of the United Kingdom. It is true a writ could be served on the Secretary of State or someone at the Foreign Office. But the plea that the document was not in the physical possession of the Foreign Office would probably have to be accepted, unless, indeed, the court ruled that constructive possession {i.e., the power to obtain possession) sufficed. The case is not likely to arise, since production of such documents is not in fact withheld in any proper case; and where it is withheld, the plea advanced is that of the public interest and not that the Secretary of State does not possess the document. ( 3 ) Fawlett v.,the Attorney-General (1667, Hardres 469). ( 4 ) Per Lord Blanesburgh in Robinson v. the State of South Australia (No. 2 1931 A C 704 at p. 714). ( 5 ) Ibid. ( 6 ) Section 939.6 further principle which has been adopted in certain cases, namely, that it is not desirable to produce either official documents or copies thereof or to permit their inspection, except in the course of legal proceedings actually instituted (see Annex IV, Cases Nos. 1-3). The argument here is that the obligation (except where the public interest forbids it) to produce or permit the inspection of documents, or copies of documents, derives solely from the duty of furthering the ends of justice, a question which normally can arise only when legal proceedings have actually been started. This principle is, ^ however, it is thought, too widely stated, and does not accord with actual practice, at any rate as regards permitting inspection of documents or supplying copies of them. The latter question being entirely within the discretion of the Secretary of State (see paragraph 16 (1) below), everything depends on the nature and importance of the documents. In the case of certain documents it is the practice to allow inspection by or to furnish copies of them to any person who shows reasonable grounds for wanting to see them. In the case of more important documents it may well be desirable to withhold copies or refuse permission to ^inspect except where litigation has been started. Even in such cases, however (see below, paragraph 17), it may be possible and desirable, while withholding the document, to furnish information as to its contents before proceedings have actually been commenced. (B) Cases in which Privilege may be Claimed in the Public Interest. 6. The question what are the documents for which privilege can properly ^ be claimed is not one to which any definite general answer can be given. It is a question of fact depending on the nature of the document and the circumstances of the case, and each request or demand for production must be treated on its merits. Nevertheless, certain general principles may be noticed :— (1) As already indicated (paragraph 4) the mere fact that documents are official or confidential is not a ground for withholding them, at any rate once a subpoena for their production in court has been issued.( 7 ) For a further discussion of this see Annex V, paragraph 4. It has been stated that the foundation of the Crown's privilege ' is that the information cannot be disclosed without injury to the public interest and not that the documents are confidential or official, which alone is no reason for their non-production.'( 8 ) (2) There are, broadly speaking, three classes of official documents involved :— (i) Documents the very existence (let alone the contents) of which it would be injurious to the public interest to disclose. An example is afforded by the secret treaties of the pre-war period. All treaties have now to be registered with the ^Secretariat of the League of Nations, but other documents of this character may exist. Ex hypothesis however, no question in regard to this class of document can arise in private litigation since the existence of the document is unknown to the parties. (ii) Documents the contents {though not the existence) of which it would be contrary to the public interest to disclose. Whether a given document is of this character can only be decided in the light of all the circumstances of the case. (iii) Documents which, as a class, are privileged from production, even though the actual contents of the particular document are innocuous. Documents of this character are of the following kinds :— [a) In the first place, with the exception of documents of a purely formal character or written expressly for publication, they include official minutes (Cabinet or departmental); reports or despatches written by officials in the course ( 7 ) It may be otherwise where it is a question of allowing inspection, or supplying copies, of documents to private litigants (see paragraph 16 (2) below). The position may also be different in certain cases regarding correspondence with other Governments (see below, paragraphs 6 (2) (iii) (b) and 13). ( 8 ) Per Swinfen Eady L.J.. in Asiatic Petroleum Company v. Anglo-Persian Oil Company (1916, l.K.B. 822 at p. 830); and see also Smith v. the East India Company (1841, 1 Ph. 50). Private persons who have in their possession documents the disclosure of which would be contrarv to the public interest, may, of course, also claim privilege for them, and may be instructed to do so by a Government Department; the Crown can apply independently to the court if a private party fails to claim privilege for them (see below, paragraph 11). The most authoritative judicial statement is now to be found in Duncan v. Cammell Laird and Co. (see Annex VI). [23898] C* 2of their duties; observations made in the course of his duty by one official concerning another or concerning any private individual; reports made to Government departments by public, private or semi-public bodies under some Act of Parliament, or otherwise in the discharge of a public duty. It is considered to be essential in the public interest and for the proper (lischarge of public business, that persons or bodies making reports, statements or observations ol this character, or writing minutes, despatches, &amp;c., in the course of their duties should be able to state their views with complete freedom, and that this would not be the case if such minutes, despatches, reports, &amp;c., were liable to publica tion or production in court. Consequently, production of any document of this character must be refused in the public interest, even though the contents of the particular document concerned happen to be quite innocuous (see Annex IV, Case No. 4, paragraph 2).( 9 ) If, in exceptional cases, production were to be made, it could only be after the most careful consideration and on the advice of a Law Officer. As a matter of courtesy, the writer of the minute, report or despatch, &amp;c., would also be consulted if possible before a final decision was taken. (The above observations should be contrasted with those inC paragraph 21 (2) (a) below.) (b) The other kind of document coming within the class, which, as a class, is priviliged, even though the contents of the particular document are innocuous, consists of communications from other (lovernments, whether foreign or Dominion (see Annex IV, Cases Nos. 2, 6, 7 and 8), other than those intended for publication, or, in some cases, of a purely formal character. No judicial dicta about this class of document exist, so far as is known; nevertheless it seems clear that it would not be in the public interest if other Governments could not freely communicate with the Government of this country without running the risk that their communications might, without their consent, be made public in open court. Consequently, it is conceived that Government Departments would be entitled (and, from the standpoint of international or Imperial courtesy, obliged)( 10 ) to refuse to produce such a document without first obtaining the consent of the Government concerned, however innocuous its contents might be. The only exception to this rule (though one which relates only to allowing inspection and not to the production of correspondence from other Governments), is of the type given in Annex IV, Case No. 6. A difficult situation would arise in the event of a court in the United Kingdom issuing a subpoena for the production of a commu nication from a foreign or Dominion Government, which it was clearly desirable in the interests of justice to produce, but in regard to which the Govern ment concerned unreasonably withheld its consent to production. It would seem to be an obvious hardship that in such a case the document should not be produced. Nevertheless, as a matter of strict right, the Department would be entitled, and probably bound, to withhold it. ^ (c) The case of communications from a Colonial Government is to some extent on the same footing. With the same exception for formal documents or (») The best judicial statement of this principle occurs in the case of Smith v. the East India Compamy (1841, 1 Ph 50), where Lord Lyndhurst said that ' it is quite obvious that public policy requires .... that the most unreserved communication should take place between the East India Company and the Board of Control ' [the Company, though theoretically autonomous, was in fact under Government control], ' that it should be subject to no restraints or limitations; but it is also quite obvious that if, at the suit of a particular individual, those communications would be subject to be produced in a court of justice, the effect would be to restrain the freedom of the communications and to render them more cautious, guarded and reserved. I think, therefore, that these communications come within that class of official communications which are privileged inasmuch as they cannot be subject to be communicated without .... injury to the public interest.' And in Hennessy v. Wright (1888, 21 Q.B.D. 509, at p. 512), Field J. said: 'There would be an end to all freedom in ... . official communica tions if they [i.e., the servants of the Crown] knew that any suitor .... could legally insist that any official communication should be produced openly in a court of justice.' The same principle was reaffirmed in the case of Ankin v. the London and North Eastern Railway Company (1930, l.K.B. 527, at p. 533), where Scrutton L.J., after approving the pronouncement of Lord Lyndhurst, above quoted, said: 'It follows that if the production of the class is contrary to the public interest, it is not necessary to consider each individual document to ascertain the exact degree to which the public interest will be prejudiced by its production.' ( 10 ) The courts would not, of course, admit international or Imperial courtesy, as such, as being a sufficient reason for withholding production of material documents. Hence the claim of privilege must be based on the public interest: production which would involve a breach of international or Imperial courtesy would, by that fact alone, be contrary to the public interest.those intended for publication, consent should certainly be sought before such communications are produced. Where the communication was made direct, e.g., to a British consul in a foreign country, and he is asked to produce it in the local courts or to furnish copies of it to litigants, he may be instructed to seek consent direct (see Annex IV, Case No. 2). But usually consent will be sought through the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Moreover, the case differs from that of foreign or Dominion Governments, in that the Secretary of State for the Colonies can override the local Colonial Government and will presumably do so in all cases where production would not, in fact, be injurious to the public interest. (C) By whom the Validity of the Claim of Privilege is determined. 7. According to the practice of the English courts regarding the production of documents by Government departments in England, a claim, if made in proper form (see paragraph 9 below), stating that the production of a given document ^ would be contrary to the public interest is in practice accepted as conclusive, and the court does not go behind the statement or itself enquire into the justifiability of the claim. Thus, Robertson, in his standard work on Civil Proceedings by and against the Crown, says: '' When the head of the Department has decided, it is not for the judge to say whether the production of any particular document is injurious to the public service or not.'^ 11 ) The principle was reaffirmed in Ankin v. the London and North Eastern Railway Company,^ 1 ) in which Lord Justice Scrutton expressed the view that ' It is the practice of the English courts to accept the statement of one of His Majesty's Ministers that production of a particular document would be against the public interest, even though the court may doubt whether any harm would be done by producing it. I have been informed on verv high authority that the practice in Scotland is different; that there the judge looks at the document and orders it to be produced if he does not agree with the Minister's reasons for considering its production to be against the public interest.( 13 ) No harm seems to have resulted from this practice. But that is not the law in England. Here if the Minister says that it would be against the public interest to produce a particular document the court accepts his statement upon his responsibility.' In those cases where the court appears to have departed from this practice and to have scrutinised and perhaps rejected the claim, it will probably be found that the ground of such action was either that in the opinion of the court the claim did not amount to a claim of privilege based on the public interest, or else that it was not made in proper form (e.g., was only made by a subordinate official on his own responsibility). The case of Duncan v. Cammell Laird and Co. (see Annex VI) now shows that a claim for non-production -^on the ground of public interest properly made on behalf of the Crown should be ''accepted as conclusive according to the practice in England and Scotland. 8. Not only is the claim, if properly made, accepted as conclusive, but it is also established that no reasons need be given for the view that production would be contrary to the public interest (but see below, paragraph 12). Thus, in Ankin's case {supra, at p. 537 of the Report), Lord Justice Slesser said : With regard to the reason given by the Minister of Transport for concluding that production of the report would be contrary to the public interest, in my view of the authorities he was not bound to give any reasons for his conclusion. In the present case he has condescended to do so. He has said, &amp;c. . . . (D) Manner in which Privilege is claimed. 9. The correct practice for claiming the privilege of non-production is set out by the Lord Chancellor in Duncan v. Cammell Laird and Co. (see Annex VI, paragraphs 5 and 6). This statement applies both to England and Scotland. [ 10. This paragraph has been cancelled.] ( n ) 1908 Edn., p. 606. In support he cites the cases of Bcnison v. Skene (1860, 5 H. and N. 838); H.M.S. Bellerophon (1874, 44 L.J.Adm. 5); Hughes v. Vargas (1893, 9 R. 661); Williams v. Star Newspaper Company (1908, 24 T.L.R. 297). ( 12 ) Ubi supra, last part of note ( 9 ), at p. 533 of the Report. ( 13 ) See Annex II and Annex VI. The House of Lords have now said that the practice in England and Scotland is the same and these remarks of Scrutton L.J. were mistaken. [23898] . D*11.—(1) It is possible that documents or copies of documents which it would be contrary to the public interest to produce may legitimately be in the hands of private parties. Thus, during the 1914—18 war, in the Asiatic Petroleum (,ase (see note ( 8 ) to paragraph 6 (1) above) the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had in their possession a contract between themselves and the Admiralty, and a copy of a letter to their agents in Persia dealing with the progress of the war in Persia and the Admiralty's views thereon, and in Duncan v. Cammell Laird and Co. (see Annex VI) Cammell Laird and Co. had in their possession, as contractors for the Admiralty, various documents relating to the submarine Thetis. Or again, a semi-public body may furnish a report to a Government Department, and retain a copy (see, for instance, Ankin's case, supra, note ( 9 ) and paragraph 7). Such parties are fully entitled to refuse production on grounds of public interest, and the Department may, if necessary, require them to do so. Again, where the docu ment consists of a letter or other communication from a Government Department, or diplomatic or consular officer, to some outside person or body, the original being in the possession of the latter, a copy only may be kept in the archives. (2) It is, however, apparently immaterial whether a Government Department C nolds the originals or only a copy in its archives, or even whether it possesses a copy at all. It is clear that the Crown has an overriding right in all cases to prevent documents in the possession of private parties being produced in litiga tion on the grounds of public interest and, if the private party does not obey a request to refuse production, to ask the court to order non-production. The Crown can do this even if the private party is its opponent in the suit (see Duncan v. Cammell Laird, Annex VI). This right should only be exercised where very clear and cogent considerations require it. (3) In cases where the withholding of production of the above-mentioned type of document is required, it is usual for a letter to be addressed to the party concerned by the Minister or permanent or assistant head of the Department, stating that production would be injurious (see Annex III, No. 3).( 14 ) This letter is then produced to the court by the party concerned, or its contents are set out by him in an affidavit. In the two of the modern cases referred to in sub paragraph (1) above (and see note ( ,4 ) below) the Department's letter to the party was accepted by the court, but in the older cases (and in Duncan v. Cammell Laird) a separate affidavit from the Minister or permanent or assistant head of the Department in the form set out in Annex III, No. 4( 15 ) was produced as well. 12. While, as already stated {supra, paragraph 8), there is no obligation to give the reasons for which production is considered to be contrary to the public interest, it may, nevertheless, in some cases be a matter of courtesy to the court and of good policy generally that this should be done, so far as is reasonably possible, in any letter, affidavit or written instructions to a subordinate which may be issued in accordance with the above rules. In some cases, of course, this could not be^ done without divulging the very matter which it was desired to keep secret. Part II.—S pecial Observations affecting Particular Classes of Documents. 13. Original documents are, in general, never produced except in court by a responsible official of the Department in person, and in suits between private persons production is not made unless the official has been served with a subpoena duces tecum. Where the Crown is a party to the suit the rule about production of originals by an official of the Department in person is, from the standpoint of the Foreign Office, modified as indicated in paragraph 6 of Annex I. Subject to the observations there made, it is contrary to practice to produce originals except where absolutely necessary, or to allow them out of departmental custody ( 14 ) In Ankin v. L.N.E.R. (latter part of note ( 9 ) supra), the letter was from the Ministry of Transport in the form ' I am directed,' &amp;c. It is quoted in Annex III, No. 3, to this Memorandum. In Asiatic Petroleum Company v. Anglo-Persian Oil Company (note ( 8 ) supra) it was apparently from the head of a department at the Admiralty on behalf of the Secretary of the Admiralty (see Duncan v. Cammell Laird —Annex VI—where the letter was written by the Treasury Solicitor). ( 15 ) See Robertson, op. cit., p. 604.(see Annex I V, Case No. 11) and an official of the Department personally produces the document in court, provided there is no objection in the public interest as defined in Part I of this Memorandum.( 16 ) 14. While originals are not produced except in court, and (in private litigation) upon subpoena, inspection of them at the Foreign Office, or any other place where they are kept, may be permitted (with or without the taking of notes) in any case where a copy of the document would normally be furnished (as to which, see below, paragraph 16), but where, on account of its length or character, no copy can conveniently be made, or where special considerations, while allowing of inspection, and possibly of notes being taken, make it desirable that a copy should not pass permanently into non-official hands (see Annex IV, Case No. 6). 15. The next question'is that of copies. Normally the question of producing copies in actual court does not arise, since courts will not admit a copy as evidence where the original is available. Where, however, the court is for any reason willing to admit a copy, one may be furnished without the necessity for a ^rrubpoena, provided there is no objection in the public interest. Similarly, if the parties ask to be furnished with a certified copy, this may be done (see Annex IV, Case No. 11). Under the Evidence Act, 1851, certain classes of 'public' documents {e.g., treaties) will be presumed by an English court to be correct if duly certified by a public official (in the case of the Foreign Office, the Librarian). 16. Apart from such exceptional cases, copies, whether certified or not, will not be required for production in court, but only by private litigants for their own purposes. While many of the principles set out in the preceding portions of this Memorandum apply equally to this case, particularly those relating to the grounds on which production can be refused in the public interest, certain special considerations exist in regard to the supply of copies to litigants. Similar con siderations arise in regard to allowing litigants to inspect original documents at the Foreign Office or elsewhere. (1) In the first place, whereas in the case of a document in regard to which a subpoena has been issued there is an obligation to produce it unless there is a legally recognised objection to doing so, no such obligation exists in regard to furnishing copies to private litigants or allowing them to inspect originals. In these matters the discretion of the Secretary of State is quite unfettered by any rule of law, and he may grant or refuse the request at will. Much will depend on the nature of the documents. As indicated in paragraph 5, certain documents are harmless, and inspection of them is habitually allowed or copies furnished. In the case of other documents it may be preferable, even if there is no specific objection to production, to refuse copies or inspection unless it appears that it is definitely desirable in the interests of justice to grant the request (see Annex IV, Cases Nos. 2, 3, 5 and 12). Objections may also exist on the following grounds : — (2) One objection might, of course, be the public interest. But whereas, in the case of a document in respect of which a subpoena or notice to produce has been issued, the public interest is, for all practical purposes, the only permissible ground of objection, in the case of furnishing copies or allowing inspection other valid grounds of objection may exist. Thus, the fact that a letter is marked ' private and confidential ' may well justify a refusal to furnish a copy of it, or ( 16 ) It used formerly to be the practice before producing any official documents in court to obtain the views, and in effect virtually the permission, of the Law Officers of the Crown. Several such opinions of the Law Officers, dating from the period 1890-1901, will be found in A 3267/1833/45 of 1920. This practice, which was no doubt adopted at a time when depart ments had not their own legal advisers, is now qua practice obsolete. The question of producing official documents in court is, of course, only partly a legal one; in particular, the question of whether production of a given document would be contrary to the public interest appears to be a political and departmental one, depending on matters of which the responsible Minister is alone in a position to judge. But while the Law Officers are not now habitually consulted# their opinion may always be obtained on the legal aspects of a given case if desired. This may be important in, e.g., the type of case in which the Department is disposed to think that production should be refused, but is aware that in the interests of justice strong grounds for production may exist, and that public dissatisfaction may be occasioned by a refusal. But, in the last resort, the decision as to producing or withholding must necessarily rest with the responsible Minister. [23898] D* 2to produce it except on subpoena^ 1 ) notwithstanding that it may be innocuous so far as the public interest is concerned (see Annex 1V, Case No. 13). Mor would the parties necessarily be prejudiced by such a relusal, lor it is always open to them to apply for and obtain a subpoena, in which case the document will have to be produced if there is no objection in the public interest. (3) The fact that, as will often be the case, the document of which a copy is requested consists of a letter, raises the question how far it is proper to furnish a copy or allow inspection of it without the consent of the writer (see Annex I V, Case No. 3). This is a point which can only be decided having regard to all the circumstances of the case, and it may well be judged proper on occasion not to furnish a copy or allow inspection unless such consent has been obtained. On the other hand, it will often be the fact that, in the nature of things, consent, even if asked for, will certainly be refused, and yet it may be-proper to furnish the copy or allow the inspection. Thus, it may happen that one party to a litigation will ask to inspect or to be furnished with a copy, not of a letter written by himself to the Foreign Office or to a post abroad, but of one written by the other party to the dispute; and it may be evident that the writer will certainly refuse his consenlC Yet it may, nevertheless, be quite clear that, in the interests of justice, the copy should be furnished or the inspection allowed, and that the absence of consent ought not to operate as a bar. Such a case is given in Annex IV, No. 3. (4) Doubts are sometimes expressed as to the propriety of furnishing copies of documents to or allowing inspection by a litigant, on the ground that this may savour of favouring one of the parties at the expense of the other, and may amount to an improper intervention in a purely private dispute (see Annex IV, Case No. 3). This is, of course, a point to be taken into consideration in deciding in what manner the Secretary of State's discretion is to be exercised, and it may sometimes be proper to refuse on this ground, leaving it to the party concerned to obtain a subpoena (see sub-paragraph (5) below). The objection is, however, one which should not be allowed to prevail in a case where, on all other grounds, it seems desirable, in the interests of justice, to comply with the request, and where the Department concerned is perfectly prepared to do as much for the other side should occasion arise. In cases of doubt any appearance of taking sides can usually be avoided by giving the same information to the other side or making it a condition that this shall be done. (5) There is, of course, a class of document which will be useful to one side only, as tending to establish his case or disprove his opponent's, and in regard to which the interests of the other side will lie, not in also obtaining the document, but in preventing it from seeing the light of day at all. But the mere fact that compliance with a request for a copy, or for inspection, will be of assistance to a litigant in establishing his case is not in itself a ground for refusal if the interests of justice appear to require that the request be granted. The leg&lt;^ principle is that, in general, everything relevant to a dispute ought to be made known, and the very fact that the document may assist in establishing the case of one of the parties may be a good reason for producing it (see Annex IV, Case No. 3). 17. Reference has been made {supra, paragraph 5) to cases where it may be undesirable to furnish copies or permit inspection of documents unless pro ceedings have actually been commenced. Instances may, however, occur where injustice, or, at any rate, grave inconvenience, would be caused by withholding from private parties all knowledge of the contents of a document until proceedings have been started. An instance of this type of case occurs where it is desired to found an action for libel on the contents, e.g., of a letter written by a private individual to one of His Majesty's consular officers. Until details of the letter are known it may be impossible for the party concerned to tell whether an action for libel will lie, or, assuming it will lie, to identify the document, in the writ to be issued, with that particularity as to its date, mode of signature, &amp;c., which the law requires. In such a case there exists at least one precedent in which, although no copy of the document was furnished until after proceedings had been commenced, sufficient indfcation of its contents was given to the plaintiff to enable the writ to be drawn up and issued (see Annex IV, Case No. 1). ( I7 ) Once a subpoena lias been issued, the mere fact that a letter is marked ' private and confidential ' is, of course, not a sufficient reason for withholding it (see Annex IV, Case No. 13), nor is the fact that its writer has forbidden its production (see Hopkinson v. Lord Burghley (L.K. 2 Oh. 47)).MMMMasMMUMMK:; SKraaxju 11 18. It may happen that an application is made in the course of litigation, not for the production of or permission to inspect a document or copy thereof, but for the supply of some information of a factual character culled from official sources. (1) In certain cases such information may and should be given. One case of this kind has been indicated in paragraph 17. Another occurs where enquiries are received from the courts or from private persons, concerning matters regarding which it is the duty of the Foreign Office to give information, e.g., whether a given individual possesses diplomatic status, or whether a given foreign Sovereign or Government is recognised, &amp;c.( 18 ) Such enquiries may, of course, be made quite apart from actual litigation and may be answered. Again, a party to a suit may ask that information be obtained or furnished concerning facts in a foreign country, and if it appears desirable in the interests of justice that this should be done, and, moreover, that the circumstances are such that the applicant is unlikely to be able to obtain reliable information for himself, the equest may be granted (see Annex IV, Case No. 14). (2) In other cases it is conceived that the request ought to be refused,( 19 ) particularly where, as would often be the fact, consent would involve actively assisting a litigant to prepare his case (see Annex IV, Case No. 15) ; though even in such cases the request should be granted where the interests of justice appear strongly to demand that the information be given, or where it would actually be contrary to the public interest to refuse.( 20 ) It may seen, at first sight, difficult to distinguish between the case of supplying information and that of furnishing copies or'allowing inspection of documents, actions which also involve, or may involve, assisting a litigant to prepare his case (see above, paragraph 16). But a distinction does exist, though it is one of degree rather than of kind. To furnish a copy of a definite document, or to allow inspection of it may be quite proper. But it is only in exceptional cases that the Department would be justified in assisting a litigant to the extent of searching official files for facts, collating information, &amp;c., and thereby very possibly giving substance to his case. Hence, except where justice or the public interests strongly require that this should be done, it has been the practice to refuse (see, for instance, Annex IV, Case No. 15). Another case where a refusal was made on the ground that compliance would involve too great a departure from impartiality, and that the public interest did not warrant it, and in which the principles governing this matter as a whole were exhaustively considered, was that of the action for libel brought by the ex-Khedive of Egypt against Messrs. Macmillan, in which the Times newspaper, who were interested as guarantors, made application to the Foreign Office for information from official sources, alleging that in the public interest His Majesty's Government should furnish it (see J 3280/3280/16 of ^931, and subsequent papers). A good illustration of a case where, had a similar request been made, it could have been granted on the ground that the public interest required it, is given in Annex I\, Case No. 5 (a case which in fact related to the inspection of documents). Part III— Special Observations concerning Production of Official Documents in Foreign Countries. 19—(i) i n countries in which His Majesty possesses exterritorial rights it it unlikely that the question of producing documents from any British Legation, Residency or Consulate for the purpose of proceeding in the heal (non-British) courts will arise. If it did, there seems to be no reason why the considerations set out in paragraph 20 below should not apply. ( 18 ) A number of cases of this kind have occurred; recent ones are Musman v. Engelke (1928 1 K.B 90, 1928, A.C. 433 (diplomatic status)), and Duff Development Company v. Government of Kelantan (1928, A.C. 395 (recognition)). There are also cases on departmental files concerning the recognition of the Soviet Government (see also Annex , C ase No. 14). ( 19 ) Of course a subpeena served on an official to give oral evidence concerning facts within the knowledge of the Foreign Office must be obeyed, subject to the right to refuse to testify regarding matters the disclosure of which would be contrary to the public interest. ( 20 ) This is possible. To withhold information in certain cases might result in an entirely erroneous impression of the actions and policy of His Majesty s (xovernment being gnon to the public (see, e.g., Annex IV, Case No. 5). [23898] lr 312 (2) As regards proceedings in British courts in such countries, the question of the production of documents by British diplomatic or consular officers is, in part, dealt with by the relevant Orders in Council (China Order in Council, 1925, s. 34; Egypt Order in Council, 1930, s. 29; Morocco Order in Council, 1929, s. 12; Abyssinia Order in Council, 1934, s. 6). If production of a document is withheld, this should be done in the light of the considerations set out in Part I of this Memorandum, as modified by local circumstances. (3) In so far as not dealt with by the relevant Order in Council, the production of documents in local British courts is presumably governed by the same general considerations as apply to Government Departments in England vis-d-vis the English courts. A consular officer desiring to withhold production on grounds of public interest should, whenever possible, obtain the certificate or written directions of the Minister, High Commissioner or (Consul-General, as the case may be. 20. The rules concerning the production or inspection of documents, the furnishing of copies or the supply of information in the course of legjf' proceedings in foreign courts are substantially the same as those already set out (see Annex IV, Cases Nos. 16-19), but the following points require special notice. Further, any cases of this kind should always be referred home for instructions. (1) It is clear that there are documents the production of which in a British court would not be open to objection in the public interest, which it would nevertheless be inadvisable to produce abroad. The same naturally applies to furnishing copies, &amp;c. (2) While the court in England can, in litigation to which the Crown is not a party, require the production of all documents for which no claim of privilege is made, foreign courts cannot, according to international law, require or compel Che production of any document the property or in the official custody of a foreign Government, even though its production would be quite innocuous so far as the public interest is concerned (see Annex IV, Cases Nos. 4, 10, 20 and 21). It is important to maintain this principle, and while, therefore, production is not in fact normally to be refused except where the public interest demands it (see Annex IV, Cases Nos. 4, 18, 19 and 20), it appears to be advisable to state to the foreign court, where production is made, and whether it is effected by a British official personally, or by means of a certified copy, that the production is made ex gratia by the express permission of the Secretary of State, and as an act of courtesy to the court for the furtherance of the ends of justice (see Annex IV, Cases Nos. 4, 19 and 20). It may be noted that a foreign court is bound to accept the statement of His Majesty's Government, made through a responsible official, that documents are part of the archives and the property or in the official custody of his Government (see Annex IV, Case No. 4). Similarly British courts should accept such a statement by a foreign diplomatic or consular official (see Annex IV, Case No. 10), though no doubt where there is reason to suppose that the official is exceeding his authority, the point may be referred to his Government through the diplomatic channel. (3) The manner in which production is effected naturally depends upon the law of the foreign country concerned, but, as in England, originals are not in any case to be produced, except in actual court by a responsible official personally, and at the express request of the court itself. &lt; , (4) The rules relating to the supply of copies to individuals, to permitting inspection or to furnishing information are the same as in Kngland, but, of course, consent must not be given to any request of this character where there is reason to believe that such action would be contrary to local law, even though no other objection may exist. Part IV— Production of Non-Official Documents in the Custody of an Official. 21.—(1) Where an official or a consular officer is consulted, or has a communication of a non-official character made to him as a private party, i.e., as a friend, or otherwise in a purely personal capacity, or has documents of a non-official character left with him in that capacity, he is in exactly the same position as a private person and cannot claim any privilege in respect either of the communication or the documents.13 (2) Where he is consulted or has a communication made to or documents left with him in his official capacity he is consulted by a British subject with regard to a possible claim relating to his treatment in a foreign country), then, even though the communication or the documents may not in themselves be official in character and may relate purely to the private affairs of the individual concerned, the documents must be regarded as being in official custody, and therefore as being 'official documents' in the particular sense in which that expression is used in this Memorandum; and the considerations set out in the preceeding paragraphs will apply, subject to the following points :— {a) Where production is required in relation to proceedings in a British court (including such a court in exterritorial countries), the only ground for refusal to disclose in court (for disclosure out of court, see Part II of this Memorandum) will be that on account of the actual nature or contents of the communication or document, production thereof, or the giving of evidence in regard thereto, would be contrary to the public interest (this is possible even where the communication or document relates to the affairs of a private person, e.g., if there was a question of making a claim against a foreign Government). In general, however, it would not be possible to say that the disclosure of these documents would affect the public interest. It might be argued that even if the individual communication or document, as such, involves no question of the public interest, privilege could be claimed on the 'class' basis (see paragraph 6 (2) (iii) above), i.e., that it was desirable in the public interest that private persons should, without fear of possible disclosure, be able to make communications to or leave documents with officials. It is doubtful, however, whether it would be advisable to put forward such a claim in an English court or in a British court in an exterritorial country. The grounds in favour of it hardly apply so far as disclosure before a British court is concerned. {h) They do, however, apply to disclosure before a foreign court, particularly as regards documents left in confidence with a consular officer by a British subject who has consulted him. In foreign courts, therefore, it would appear that the matter generally would come under para graph 20 (1) above. In practice, cases would only be likely to arise m connexion with documents deposited with a consular officer in a foreign country. Disclosure could not in any event be compelled, even from consular officers, since the documents would be ' official ' or in official custody {vide swpra). The question, therefore, would be whether the documents should be produced voluntarily to the foreign court or not, and the decision would obviously depend on all the facts of the individual case, due weight being given to the general consideration that the public interest requires that individuals should be able to consult their consuls in confidence, and leave documents with them without fear of disclosure. (Annex IV, Cases Nos. 21-23, may be consulted generally in regard to the above.) Oral Evidence. 22. The preceding paragraphs of this Memorandum have dealt with the production and disclosure of documents; but similar considerations apply to the giving of evidence by officials or consuls about matters coming within the sphere of their official duties. Obviously where it is possible and proper to refuse the disclosure of a document, it is equally possible and right to refuse to give oral evidence of its contents. Jurther, where, if the matter had been contained in a document, it would have been possible and proper to refuse to disclose it, it is equallv possible and proper to refuse to give evidence about it, although it is not recorded in writing. Lord Simon (L.C.) m Duncan v. Cammel Laird (Annex VI) said • ' The same principle as applied to documentary evidence must apply to the exclusion of verbal evidence which, if given, would jeopardise the interests of the community.' Foreign Office, May 31, 1942. [23898] \v 4ANNEX I. Note on Crown Cases when Production is desired from the Crown. [Memorandum, paragraph 2.] 1. The question of producing official documents also arises in civil proceedings, to which the Crown is a party, but in this case where production is required /rom the Crown its determination rests on a fundamentally different basis. Whereas in cases between private parties the Minister or official ' subpoenaed ' to produce an official document is bound to obey and can in practice only withhold production on the ground of the public interest, in Crown cases the Crown is by virtue of the prerogative entitled to disclose or withhold at pleasure. If disclosure is made, it is made as an act of grace, and the matter lies wholly within the unfettered discretion of the Crown. In practice, however, the invariable rule is to make as complete disclosure as though the proceedings were between private parties, subject always to with holding documents production of which would be contrary to the public interest. The position has been stated as follows by Kigby L. J. in Attorney-General v. Newcastle-npon-Ti/ne Corpora tion (1897 2 Q.B. 384, at p. 395): ' The law is that the Crown is entitled to full discovery, and that the subject as against the Crown is not. That is a prerogative of the Crown, part of the law of England ' He went on to state, however, that in fact ' there has always been the utmost care to give .... that discovery which the Crown would have been compelled to give if in the position of a subject, unless there be some plain overruling principle of public interest concerned which cannot be disregarded ' (see Duncan v. Cammell Laird, Annex VI, paragraph 3). 2. Where the Foreign Office is involved in litigation, the Treasury Solicitor will conduct the proceedings and will advise what documents are required for the purposes of the Crown's case, and what documents should be disclosed to the other side, and will similarly make the necessary arrangements for affording such disclosure. The same applies to litigation involving other Departments in which, however, Foreign Office documents are required, except that, as regards civil cases, certain Departments have their own Solicitor, who will conduct the proceedings. 3. The Foreign Office is entitled to object to disclosing any Foreign Office document disclosure of which would from the standpoint of the Department be contrary to the public interest. This matter would, of course, be one for discussion between the Department and the Treasury Solicitor (or as the case may be), but the Department must remain the final judge of what would and what would not be injurious from the Foreign Office standpoint (i.e., from the point of view of the conduct of foreign affairs and allied matters), subject always (where the question involves some other Department) to the possibility of a Cabinet decision in the matter. 4. In deciding whether disclosure of a given document shall, for reasons of pubMc interest, not be made, the Department should be guided generally by the principles contained in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Memorandum. It should particularly be noticed that the fact that a given document may be helpful or injurious to the Crown's case is irrelevant in this connexion :— (a) On the one hand, if disclosure would, in fact, be contrary to the public interest, it should not be made, however helpful to the Crown's case the document may be. Thus, for instance, it is the invariable practice, save in wholly exceptional cases and on the advice of a Law Officer, to withhold documents of the kind specified in paragraph 6 (2) (iii) (a) of the Memorandum, even though they strongly support the case of the Crown. (b) On the other hand, the fact that a document is injurious to the Crown's case is not per se any reason for withholding it. Disclosure should be made unless there are overriding considerations of the general public interest. A strong expression of opinion to this effect was given by Lord Blanesburgh in Robinson v. State of South Australia (1931 A.C. 704, at p. 715): ' Particularly must it be remembered in this connexion that the fact that production of the documents might, in the particular litigation, prejudice the Crown's own case or assist that of the other side is no such ' plain overriding principle of public interest' as to justify any claim of privilege. The zealous champion of Crown rights may frequently be tempted to take the opposite view, particularly in cases where the claim against the Crown seems to him to be harsh or unfair. But such an opposite view is without justification. In truth, the fact that the documents might have any such effect upon the litigation is of itself a compelling reason for their production—one only to be overborne by the gravest considerations of State policy or security.' 5. I here are, of course, other grounds besides the public interest on which disclosure can justifiably be withheld. These are not treated of here because they are for the most part such as would entitle private parties to refuse production, and are not peculiar to the Crown or its special position. They are purely legal and not political in character, and if any document is to be withheld on one of these grounds, it must be on the advice of the Treasury Solicitor (or as the case may be—see paragraph 2 of this Annex).6. The Foreign Office rale that originals of Departmental documents must not leave the custody of Foreign Office officials, and, if produced in court, must be produced by a responsible official of the Department in person (see Memorandum, paragraph 13), is modified for the purpose of Crown cases. Such documents as are to be produced or disclosed may and should be handed over on request to the Treasury Solicitor (or as the case may be—see above, paragraph 2). ANNEX TI. Note ov Practice in Scotlavd. [Memorandum, paragraphs B and 7.] It has been suggested that the practice in Scotland may differ from that in England inasmuch as in England the statement made in proper form that the production of a given document would be contrary to the public interest is accepted as conclusive by the court, but in Scotland the judge inspects the document himself, and orders it to be produced if he disagrees with the view that production would be injurious (see per Lord Justice Scrutton in Anhin v. The London and North Eastern Railway, Memorandum, paragraph 7). Lord Thankerton, however, a former Scottish law officer, to whose attention Lord Justice Scrutton's remarks were drawn in a later case {Robinson v. The State of South Australia, 1931 A.C. 704, at p. 708) said that he knew of no difference between the practice in the two countries. The Lord Advocate's Department, who have been consulted, have expressed the opinion that while in theory the courts in Scotland may have power to order production of a document in the possession of a Government Department, even though the public interest is pleaded as a ground for refusing it, this power is seldom, if ever, exercised, and that in practice the position in Scotland is much the same as in England. In support of this view they have cited the cases of Admiralty v. Aberdeen Steam Trawling and Fishing Company (1919 S.C. 335) and Caffrey v. Lord Inverclyde (1930 S.C. 762). In the former case it appears that the court of first instance had ordered Admiralty documents to be made available so that the court might consider whether they were fit for production or not, but that on appeal this order was reversed on the ground that the Admiralty were much better judges than the court could be as to whether production would be contrary to the public interest. In 1942 the House of Lords in Duncan v. Cammell Laird and Co. (Annex VI) stated that there was no difference between the practice in England and Scotland, and that the observations of Scrutton, L.J., referred to above were based on misinformation. ANNEX III.

W 7246 and 179061/7449/58 of 1922. In August 1922 Messrs. J. J. Edwards and Co. requested a copy, or sight of, an alleged libellous letter respecting Mr. C. Staniforth, chairman of the A.G.N. Syndicate, written by shareholders of the syndicate to His Majesty's Consul-General at Algiers. They were informed that the Secretary of State did not feel justified in producing either original or copy unless application was made ' in the course of legal proceedings ' [Memorandum, paragraph 5]. Particulars of the letter (date, signatories, &amp;c.) were, however, supplied, in order that it might be identified for purposes of issuing the writ [Memorandum, paragraph 17]. A writ was subsequently issued at the suit of Mr. Staniforth against members of the syndicate, and upon receipt of a copy of the writ at the Foreign Office, the plaintiffs were supplied with a copy of the letter in question. Case No. 2. Memorandum, paragraphs 5, 6 (2) (iii) (b) and (c) and 16 (1). L 3433/3433/405 of 1932. I An application was made to His Majesty's Consul-General at Loanda on behalf of a Mr. E. J. E. Lange, a citizen of Cape Town, for the supply of copies of correspondence between Mr. Lange and the Consulate-General, which were required for the purposes of a lawsuit, and also of correspondence regarding Mr. Lange's affairs exchanged between the Consulate-General and the Governments of the Union of South Africa, South-West Africa and Angola. The Consul-General was instructed that, provided proceedings had actually been commenced [Memorandum, paragraph 5], and that he was reasonably satisfied that the documents were necessary for the purposes of the lawsuit [Memorandum, paragraph 16 (1)], he might supply copies of the private correspondence and, with the consent of the Governments concerned, of the inter-governmental correspondence also, if he considered that it would not be contrary to the public interest to do so [Memorandum, paragraphs 6 (2) (iii) (b) and (c)].Case No. 3. Memorandum, paragraphs 5 and 16. C 4750/2324/12 of 1932. Litigation was in progress in Czechoslovakia between Sir Richard Waldie Griffith and his former agent, Herr Kurt Seebohm, concerning the ownership of certain mining shares. Sir Richard desired to be supplied with copies of letters about Sir Richard's business written by Herr Seebohm to the British Legation at Prague prior to the outbreak of the dispute between them. Doubts were expressed whether it would be proper to comply (a) on the ground of appearing to favour one side at the expense of the other [Memorandum, pararaph 16 (4)], (h) because a breach of confidence might be involved, unless the writer consented, which it was clear he would not do [Memorandum, paragraph 16 (3)]. It was, however, decided to comply with the request. The correspondence was not marked private or confidential [Memorandum, paragraph 16 (2)] ;; it was clearly in the interests of justice that copies should be supplied [Memorandum, paragraph 16 (1)] ; further, the letters having been written at a time when the writer was acting on Sir Richard Waldie Griffith's behalf, it was to be presumed that, whatever Hen- Seebohm now intended, he had, when he wrote them, meant them to be used in any manner which would benefit his principal [Memorandum, paragraph 16 (5)]. Proceedings having actually been commenced [Memorandum, paragraph 5]. permission to supply copies was accordingly given. The Consul-General at New York was subpoenaed, and the Passport Control Officer was about to be subpoenaed, to produce the originals of certain cards of application for passport visas filed by United States citizens. These cards were required as affording evidence of the status of parties to certain matrimonial proceedings in the New York courts. Instructions were sought. It was decided that as the cards in question were the property of His Majesty's Government, and part of the archives, production of them could not be compelled, nor could individual offu-ers be made to answer questions in respect of them [Memorandum, paragraph 20 (2)]. Instructions were accordingly given that, if necessary, appearance should be made in court, and the position explained as above, and that the State Department should be informed to the same effect. It was pointed out in minutes that the United States courts would be bound to accept the statement of a responsible officer of His Majesty's Government that the documents were the property of his Government [Memorandum, ihid.']. It was subsequently decided that, the documents being innocuous from the standpoint of the public interest, voluntary production of them might be made [Memorandum, ihid.], and instructions were issued authorising this provided the cards bore no minutes other than of a formal character [Memorandum, paragraph 6 (2) (iii) (a)], and that it was made clear that the production \\as an act of grace and not to be regarded as a precedent [Memorandum, paragraph 20 (2)]. I he Palestine Potash Company, who had been granted a concession by the Government of Palestine to extract salts from the Dead Sea, were sued as trespassers by a French company, who alleged themselves to be in possession of a valid and still subsisting pre-war Turkish concession relating to the same subject-matter. Lord Lytton, on behalf of the Palestine Potash Company, applied to be allowed to inspect certain official documents, and put forward as a ground the fact that one of the points at issue in the suit would be the validity of a concession granted by the Government of a territory in respect of which His Majesty had accepted a mandate : in other words, that it was in the public interest that this company should be assisted [Memorandum, paragraph 18 (2), footnote ( 20 )]. The request was granted. It is probable that it would have been granted even had no considerations of public interest been involved, seeing that justice in any event seemed to require it [Memorandum, paragraph 16 (])] and that there were certainly no considerations of public interest against it. But the existence of positive grounds in the public interest for granting the request naturally strengthened the reasons for doing so, and probably makes the case one of that class where, even had the request been for the supply of information from official sources, and not merely for the inspection of certain documents, it could have been granted [Memorandum, end of paragraph 18 (2)]. Case No. 4. Memorandum, paragraphs 6 (2) (iii) (a) and 20 (2). T 1498 and 1751/1498/373 of 1931. Case No. 5. Memorandum, paragraphs 16 (1) and 18 (2) and note ( 20 ). E 421/90/31 of 1932.21 Case No. 6. Memorandum, paragraphs 6 (2) (iii) (6) and 14. E 2015/90/31 of 1932. This is the continuation of the preceding case. The permission accorded was for the inspection of certain documents at the Colonial Office. Among these were copies of certain communications to His Majesty's Government from the French Government. Normally, inspection of such documents by private parties without the consent of the foreign Government concerned would not be allowed [Memorandum, paragraph 6 (2) (iii) (b)]. The circumstances of the present case were, however, peculiar. The matters in dispute between the British and French companies had already been the subject of diplomatic correspondence between His Majesty's Government and the French Government, each of whom had taken up the case on behalf of its nationals. It having been found impossible to settle the matter diplomatically, private litigation was resorted to, but the matter nevertheless was, and remained, of a semi-public nature. The principles applicable to the correspondence from the French Government were to some extent rather those set out in paragraph 16 (3) of the Memorandum than those of paragraph 6 (2) (iii) (6). It was certain that the French Government would have refused its /-^consent to production of the correspondence if it had been asked. While this circumstance would certainly prevent any production in open court, or even supplying the British litigants with copies, it was felt that in all the circumstances they might be allowed to inspect the documents, and possibly to take notes [Memorandum, paragraph 6 (2) (iii) (?&gt;)]. By a misunderstanding, the agent of the Palestine Potash Company was permitted by the Colonial Office to take away copies of the documents, and inter alia of the correspondence with the French Government. It was felt that this was improper in the absence of the consent of that Government [Memorandum, paragraph 6 (2) (iii) {h)~\, and that, while it might be possible to allow simple inspection, it would not be proper to run the risk of extra copies being made and ^ permanently retained in non-official hands [Memorandum, paragraph 14]. The company were ^ therefore asked to return the documents, and an assurance was obtained that no copies would be taken or kept. Case No. 7. * Memorandum, paragraph 6 (2) (iii) (h). T 2233 and 6424/1/373 of 1930. His Majesty's Minister at Santiago stated that he had been requested b}' a British company engaged in local litigation to furnish copies of correspondence regarding the company's affairs which had been exchanged between the Legation and certain Chilean Government Departments. He was instructed to state his views as to the Chilean Government agreeing to production. He accordingly consulted that Government, who stated that the production of the correspondence would be embarrassing to them politically. The company were thereupon asked not to press the matter. Case No. 8. Memorandum, paragraph 6 (2) (iii) (b). T 4774, 6686 and 7453/4774/371 of 1932. The validity of a will was in dispute in the English courts, the deceased being alleged to have been of unsound mind. He had committed suicide at Nice, and the French authorities had in their possession a letter written by him before he died which was stated to afford some evidence of insanity. The Foreign Office were asked to obtain this letter for the purposes of the lawsuit. The letter was accordingly obtained from the French Government under cover of a note from the French Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The question of proving the genuineness of ^ the letter arose, and it was thought possible that the French covering note might have to be produced in court. It was decided that this could not be done without the consent of the French Government, who were accordingly asked if they had any objection. They replied that in principle they had, but would make an exception in this case, provided no copy of their note was allowed to remain in the records of an English court. Case No. 9. Memorandum, paragraph 11 (3). N 3794/2823/38 of 1932. An English company, the London and Northern Trading Company, were engaged in litigation with the Russian company Arcos in the English courts. It was material to the English company's case to obtain information as to recent legislative changes in Russia, and copies of certain Russian laws. The Embassy, being asked to attend to the matter, furnished the company with information direct through the commercial counsellor, who, however, accompanied it by a request that the source of the information be not revealed, as it would tend *22 to make it difficult for information to be procured in future from the Soviet authorities. Compliance with this request involved not producing in court the original letters from the Plmbassy. The company wrote to the Foreign Office to say that they had lost their case in the court of first instance, and that they attributed their defeat in some considerable degree to not having been able to produce the letters from the Embassy. They accordingly asked that the veto be removed, so that they might produce the letters at the hearing of the case on appeal. It appeared extremely doubtful whether production would, in fact, make the difference to the company's case which they imagined, but it was decided that permission must none the less be granted. It was pointed out in minutes that the originals of the documents were in the hands of the company, and that His Majesty's Government were possessed of copies only; that in consequence production could not, in fact, be prevented, if the company were determined to produce (the case was certainly not one in which it would be desirable to raise the Official Secrets Acts); that so far the company had voluntarily abstained from production, but that only the clearest and most cogent considerations of public interest could justify maintaining the request not to produce in the face of the company's clear (though very possibly erroneous) conviction that production would make all the difference between winning and losing their case. As no such considerations of public interest appeared to exist, 'permission' to produce was accordingly given. \ Case No. 10. Memorandum, paragraphs 11 (3) and 20 (2). T 11560 and 14539/1/373 of 1930. An action for libel was brought in the courts in Cyprus against the Austrian Consul at Larnaca, in the course of which it was sought to make him produce documents forming part of his archives. Upon representations being received from the Austrian Minister in London, instructions were issued through the Colonial Office that the Consul was entitled to claim inviolability for his archives, and that his statement that the documents in question formed part of his archives must be accepted, unless, upon the matter being referred to his Government, the latter did not support his claim [Memorandum, paragraph 20 (2)]. Subsequently it transpired that certain documents for which privilege was claimed consisted of letters written by the Consul to private persons, the originals being in the hands of the latter, and copies only being retained in the consular archives. It was decided that, as such documents (i.e., the originals) clearly formed no part of the archives, the Consul had no right to object to their production (i.e., of the originals) merely because a copy had been retained in the archives [Memorandum, paragraph 11 (3)]. (He might, of course, have objected to producing the copy, but this question could scarcely have arisen where the original was available.) Case No. 11. Memorandum, paragraphs 13 and 15. E 10066/5570/201 of 1924. Air. \ . W. Whittal, repatriated from Jibuti in 1924, applied upon his return to the United Kingdom for the original or a photograph of a letter addressed to His Majesty's Vice-Consul atC Jibuti b^ a Mr. G. B. ( hapman, by whom Mr. Whittal had been employed to purchase wild animals for shipment to England. He proposed proceeding against Mr. Chapman for salary due, breach of contract and libel. Mr. Whittal had a copy of the letter in his possession, and he was advised to see if this would be accepted, as the original was not available in this country. After a writ had been issued, Mr. Whittal renewed his request, and His Majesty's Consul at Addis Ababa was instructed to forward to the Foreign Office the original letter from Air. ( hapman. At the same time Mr. Whittal was informed that upon receipt of the letter it might be possible for the Foreign Office to furnish him with ' certified copies for production in court, as is usual in these cases [Memorandum, paragraph 15]. It would be contrary to the practice of this Department, however, to allow the original document to be out of its custody, and it could therefore only be produced in court by an official of the Foreign Office, attending the court upon a subpoena [Memorandum, paragraph 13]. Case No. 12. Memorandum, paragraph 16 (1). T 4080/3684/377 of 1931. Mr. Piatt, former judge of the Supreme Court in Egypt, was being sued in England for libel. Some of the alleged libels were contained in letters in the possession of the Consulate-General at Alexandria. Mr. Piatt's solicitors applied to the Foreign Office to be allowed to inspect these documents. 'There being no objection in the public interest, and the interests of justice appearing to require it, permission was granted, and instructions were given for the transmission of the documents to London.23 Caso No. 13. Memorandum, paragraph 16 (2) and note ( 17 ). L 1042/238/405 of 1932. Proceedings were instituted against The Times by Mr. Merton, a former British official who had served under the Egyptian Government. The solicitors for The Times applied to His Majesty's High Commissioner at Cairo for a copy of a letter addressed by Mr. Merton to Lord Allenby on the 4th July, 1922, Copies of this, his own letter, had already been supplied to Mr. Merton. In addition to the letter being of an official character (it was written by a British official to the High Commissioner in regard to his retirement from the service), it was marked ' private and confidential,' and The Times solicitors were therefore informed that the Secretary of State did not feel justified in supplying them with a copy of it at that stage of the proceedings [Memorandum, paragraph 16 (2)]. If, however, a subpopna were issued for the production of the original document, it would be produced, subject to any objection which might be raised at the trial [Memorandum, ihid., note ( 17 )]* It was added that as copies of the letter had been supplied to Mr. Merton, The Times would presumably be able to obtain copies on discovery. The document, however, was not required, since a settlement was reached, and the case did not go to trial. Case No. 14. Memorandum, paragraph 18 (1) and note ( 18 ). F 1292/1292/10 of 1932, An enquiry was received through the Colonial Office from solicitors in Hong Kong who were acting for persons against whom an action was being brought in the Hong Kong courts to enforce a judgment given in 1928 by the High Court of Kwangtung in China, It was desired to determine whether, at that date, this court was a regularly constituted one, duly set up by the sovereign authority in China, In consequence the Foreign Office were asked to state whether the court was recognised by the competent British authorities as having been established by and functioning under a recognised Government of China. It was felt that the Foreign Office neither could nor should make any pronouncement as to the relations between this court and any Government or local administration in China, or as to the regularity of the manner in which the court was constituted. On the other hand, the question whether, and to what extent. His Majesty's Government had recognised the Govern ment or local administration which purported to have set up the court was a question peculiarly within the province of the Foreign Office, in which it had a duty to give information; and a reply on this point was accordingly returned. Case No, 15. Memorandum, paragraph 18 (2). N 3401/44/38 of 1932, An English firm, Messrs. Priestley, brought an action for libel in the English courts against the Russian company Arcos. It was material to their case to prove that Arcos were controlled by the Soviet Government, and that the members both of Arcos and of the Soviet Government belonged to the Communist party. They asked the Foreign Office, through their solicitors, to supply information on these points. It was decided that to do so would in all the circumstances of the case, and having regard to the nature of the information sought, constitute an improper intervention in a private litigation, and a reply was returned accordingly. The English company did not indicate any definite official document of which they wished to be furnished with a copy; and the case was a typical one where information (as contrasted with supplying a copy of a definite document) could not have been furnished without virtually identifying His Majesty's Government with the enquirers' case, and actively assisting them to get it up, and no considerations of public interest were involved which would have justified such a departure from impartiality. (See also the ex-Khedive case in para graph 18 (2) of the Memorandum.) Case No. 16. Memorandum, paragraph 20. A 3267/1833/45 of 1920. In the course of proceedings brought in the United States district court of Kansas in connexion with the estate of one Margaret Ingoldsby, it was desired to establish that the provisions contained in article 4 of the Anglo-United States Convention of 1899 on the Disposalof Real and Personal Property did not have the effect of limiting the rights of British subjects on account of their connexion with a territory not covered by the Convention. The Colonial Office, who were interested in the case, asked that copies of official despatches, in which Lord Salisbury's view of the matter had been fully expressed, might be supplied for production in court. Copies of the relevant despatches were accordingly certified by the Librarian, and sent to His Majesty's Ambassador at Washington to be handed to the solicitor engaged in the case. Case No. 17. Memorandum, paragraph 20. L 12*24, 1542 and 2179/1224/405 of 1928. Proceedings in the Dutch courts were instituted by the British firm of Gilbert Marchant and Co. against a German firm, Schnabel and Co., who were alleged to have defrauded them. The German firm in their defence made use of statements contained in a letter written by one J. Lissauer to His Majesty's Consul-General at Hamburg, and Messrs Gilbert Marchant and Co. asked to be supplied with a copy of the letter in order to answer Schnabel's defence. An application had previously been made by them to His Majesty's Consul-General,^ who had refused. It was pointed out to the Consul-General that his action might enable the firm to claim that their efforts to establish a case against a foreign firm which had defrauded them, so far from being assisted by the British authorities, were being impeded. It could not be maintained that the public interest was in any way served by withholding the letter, and there was the possibility that an order might be obtaned from the Dutch court for its production, in which case questions of an embarrassing character might arise. In the absence of any specific reasons which might be advanced by the Consul-General, it was proposed to supply the firm with a copy of Lissauer's letter. No grounds to the contrary were advanced, and an uncertified copy of the letter was supplied. Case No. 18. Memorandum, paragraphs 20 and 20 (2). 12919/2465 Consr. France 1908. In 1876 the original or a copy of a document was required in evidence before a civil court in Germany; on the 3rd January, 1877, the Law Officers advised on this case that ' His Majesty's consular officers abroad should, on the order of local courts, produce copies or originals of declarations made by them in their official capacity, where such declarations relate to the interests of individuals only and the public interests are not concerned.' It is, however, conceived that such production would remain voluntary and could not be compelled by the local courts in so far as the documents were part of the archives. Case No. 19. Memorandum, paragraph 20 and 20 (2). ^ 12919/2465 Consr. France 1908. His Majesty's Consul-General at Paris requested instructions regarding the production in court, if required, of consular registers or consular fee cash books. The plaintiffs in the proceedings denied the existence of a document alleged to have been signed by them at the Consulate-General, while the consular fee book showed that a power of attorney had been executed by them on the date in question. The Consul-General was informed that he might, if requested, produce in court the fee cash book, or a certified copy of the page required, making, however, the reservation that he did so by permission of the Secretary of State as a matter of grace to the court and in order to further the ends of justice. Case No. 20. Memorandum, paragraph 20 (2). T 3377/1498/373 of 1981. The Passport Control Officer in Paris was asked to produce certain letters from a film company asking him to grant a visa to one of their employees. These letters were stated to be material to litigation in the Paris courts between the company and the employee concerned. Instructions were issued that the letters, being the property of His Majesty's Government, production of them could not be compelled, but that nevertheless voluntary production might be made provided it was indicated that this was done as an act of grace.25 Case No. 21.. Memorandum, paragraphs 20 (2) and 21. T 7896/1/373 of 1930. A summons was served upon the United States Vice-Consul at Newcastle, Mr. Polutnik, to appear before the Sheriff's Court at Glasgow and to produce certain documents which would tend to show that certain persons had travelled to America as man and wife. He was instructed by the United States authorities to refuse to appear if the desired testimony involved official business or the production of information from his archives. The United States Embassy in London informed the Foreign Office of this. In reply they were told that, according to the British view, a consul could not refuse to appear upon a subpoena. lie must do so and state to the court his objection to giving evidence; and that while he was entitled to refuse to produce any documents forming part of the archives and the property of his Government or to answer ■ questions concerning their contents, he should not refuse to give evidence merely on the ground that it would result in disclosing something he had learned in the course of carrying out this official duties. In this particular case what the vice-consul was asked to disclose related only to certain facts which he had observed for himself; it did not involve disclosing any confidential communi cations made to him in his official capacity by an American citizen. Had it done so, the principles enunciated in the next succeeding case would have applied. Case No. 22. Memorandum, paragraphs 21 and 22. 12919/2465 Consr. France 1908. On the 14th July, 1883, the Law Officers gave an opinion on the obligation of Her Majesty's Consul at Malaga to disclose to a local judge certain confidential communications between himself and a British subject. They pointed out that forced disclosure of confidential communi cations made to a consul for the purpose of obtaining his advice would constitute an interference with his duties, and that the application for such disclosure should be declined. But they stated that this remark did not apply to documents, non-official in character, deposited with the consul, which would not, simply by the fact of their being deposited with him, be saved from production. (This case should be compared with No. 21.) The last part of this opinion appears to be at variance with the principle, stated in paragraph 21 of the Memorandum, that documents, non-official in character, if deposited with a consular officer in his official capacity, are to be regarded as 'official,' and that production of them in a foreign court cannot be compelled, though it may be made voluntarily. There is, moreover, no good ground for distinguishing between the production of documents and the giving of oral evidence (see Memorandum, paragraph 22). Case No. 23. Memorandum, paragraph 21. 12919/2465 Consr. France 1908. Sir E. Davidson, in a minute in 1898, said: 'It really comes to this, I think, putting actual archives on one side, that whether immunity from disclosure of a particular document in the possession of a consul can be properly claimed or not depends on the nature of the document and the capacity in which the consul was acting at the time it came into his possession. The consul, however, if subpoenaed to produce a document in respect of which he desired to claim immunity from disclosure, would have to attend the court and make his claim at the proper time, when the court would decide the matter.' The latter part of this opinion appears to be unsound. It is for the consular officer to decide in what capacity he received the document ; and if it was in his official capacity the comment made at the end of the preceding case will apply. # ANNEX V. Prosecutions under the Official Secrets Acts in respect of the Unauthorised Puhlication of Official Documents. [Memorandum, paragraph 2 (2).] 1. In order to obtain a conviction under the Official Secrets Acts for the unauthorised publication of an official document, it is sufficient to show that the publication was, in fact, unauthorised, and it is not necessary to go on to show that its publication was also injurious to the public interest. It is, however, unusual for proceedings to be brought under the Official Secrets Acts except where the publication was not only unauthorised, but also, in fact, injurious. The sense in which the word 'injurious' is used in the present connexion is explained below.2. But the injnriousness of the publication, though not material on the question whether an offence has been committed or not, is material as regards the degree of punishment which the offender is to receive. Judges are reluctant to inflict heavy sentences in cases where the publication, though technically contrary to the Acts, has been quite innocuous, while, on the other hand, in cases where serious harm has been done, a greater degree of punishment may be deserved. For these reasons Government Departments may be asked to give evidence as to the degree of injury which has been caused. Such evidence may be called for by the prosecution where the case is a serious one, or it may be called for by the defence where the publication was, in fact, innocuous and there is hope of obtaining a light sentence on that ground. 3. Government Departments cannot refuse to give the required evidence in such cases, whether it is wanted by the prosecution or by the defence, and a responsible official having knowledge of the question, or some other official who has been properly instructed, if necessary in a letter from the Minister or permanent head of the Department which he can take with him to the court, must attend and give evidence. In considering whether the publication of any given document is injurious or not there may be a tendency on the part of Government Depart ments to conclude that any unauthorised publication is ipso facto injurious because it is unauthorised. This point of view is, however, not correct, and may result in serious injustice being done. The Official Secrets Acts are drawn in very wide terms purposely with the object ^ of covering, if the occasion should arise, a wide range of cases; but it is well known that in point of fact the publication, even without authority, of a number of official documents cannot cause any harm. There is, indeed, a class of documents which, although official and marked ' confidential,' is, in fact, not confidential at all, inasmuch as the documents have been made public elsewhere. Of this kind are League of Nations documents. 4. For the purpose, therefore, of answering questions concerning the degree of injuriousness involved in publishing documents without authorisation, it is not sufficient to assume that an unauthorised publication is ipso facto injurious. It is necessary to consider the actual document, and to state whether, in the opinion of the Department, its publication has, in fact, caused, or is likely to cause, actual injury or not. In this connexion it should be noticed that Departments need only answer yes or no to the question whether publication is injurious or not. They cannot be cross-examined or asked to stale the reasons for their answer, or to go into any details. Sometimes, of course, it is impossible to consider one document by itself. It may well form part of a series, the publication of which as a whole is injurious, although certain individual documents in the series are innocuous. In such cases it is legitimate to hold that the publication of the latter was injurious if it took place as part of the publication of a series. Except in such cases, however, it is necessar} 7 to consider each document separately, and to give an answer as to whether it has actually caused injury or not. 5. The best recent illustration of the above principles was afforded by the proceedings brought under the Official Secrets Acts against Mr. Compton Mackenzie (see L 5905/5905/402). The minutes on that paper set out clearly the principles applicable. The Compton Mackenzie case was in part concerned with the unauthorised disclosure of certain facts, and in part with the unauthorised publication of official documents. That part of the case which related to the documents, however, proved to be of secondary importance, not because an offence had not been committed in respect of them, since their publication was, in fact, unauthorised, but because the Department concerned gave evidence that their publication had not, in fact, caused^ any injury. Had the Foreign Office been consulted before the proceedings were commenced (which it was not) this part of the case would probably never have been embarked upon. It was also made clear from the final observations of the judge that in giving Mr. Compton Mackenzie a comparatively light sentence he was partly influenced by the fact that the publication of the documents had admittedly caused no injury. It is probable that if the Department involved had stated that injury had been caused, his sentence would have been heavier, and might have involved imprisonment instead of a fine. ANNEX VI. Duncan v. Cammell Laird and Co., Ltd., 58 T.L.R. 242 (House of Lords). The Plaintiffs were the personal representatives of civilian employees of the Defendant company, who had lost their lives when the submarine Thetis, built by the Defendant company for the Admiralty, sank in Liverpool Bay in 1939 during trials. The Plaintiffs were suing for damages under the Fatal Accidents Act. In the course of the proceedings, a list of documents in the possession of the Defendant company, which the Plaintiffs desired to inspect, was submitted to the First Lord of the Admiralty, who directed the Defendant company to refuse inspection on the grounds that their production would be contrary to the public interest. These documents came into the possession of the Defendants in their capacity as contractors for the Admiralty. The objection to their production was set out, first of all in a letter from the27 Treasury Solicitor to the solicitors of the Detendant company and then in an affidavit sworn personally by the First Lord of the Admiralty, stating that he had considered the matter personally in consultation with his technical advisers. The documents were the contract for the building of the submarine and her machinery, letters relating to the vessel before the disaster, reports as to her condition when raised, plans and specifications and a notebook of a foreman painter employed by the defendants. •2. The Plaintiffs applied for an order from the court directing production and this order was refused by the Master and on appeal by the Judge in Chambers, the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords. The judgment of Lord Chancellor Simon in the House of Lords, with which the six other Lords sitting concurred, deals with the whole subject of the right of the Crown to prevent production in litigation of documents on the ground that their disclosure is contrary to the public interest. In this case, but for the objection taken on behalf of the ( rown, the Defendant company would have been obliged to disclose and produce the documents asked for.( 21 ) 3. The Lord Chancellor pointed out that the non-production of documents, which a party to a suit desired to make use of in his own interest, may have the result that equal justice cannot be done in the action. The question of the right of the Crown to prevent production .n grounds of public interest may arise (as in the present case) in a suit between private parties, or where the Crown is a party to the proceedings and declines itself to produce or objects to their production by the other side. Where the Crown (which for this purpose must be taken to include a government department or a Minister of the Crown in his official capacity) is a party to a suit, though it is entitled to discovery from its opponent it cannot be required to give discovery of documents at all, consequently no special ground of objection is needed, though in practice for reasons of fairness and in the interests of justice all proper discovery and produc tion would and should be made. Therefore, the question of production only arises as a matter of strict law in England in cases where a subpoena is issued to a Minister or a department to produce a document (usually but not necessarily in a suit where the Crown is not a party) or where the Crown intervenes in a suit between private individuals (as in the present case) to secure that the documents in the hands of one of the litigants should not be produced or where the Crown considers it necessary to prevent production of a document in the possession of its opponent in litigation. The Crown has a right to prevent the production in litigation of documents on the ground of public interest. 4. Production of a document may be contrary to the public interest either on the grounds of the contents of the particular documents asked for or on the ground that it belongs to a class of communications which must be prevented from production because the candour and completeness of such communications might be^ prejudiced if they were ever liable to be disclosed in subsequent litigation. Examples taken from previous oases of documents protected from production as belonging to such a class were minutes and files of the East India Company; reports by the commander of a naval vessel to the Admiralty on a collision; reports by a police officer to his superior on a street accident. 5. The question of the Crown's right to prevent production may arise in a civil action either (i) (as in this case) before the trial begins, out of an application for inspection of 'Scuments referred to in the affidavit of one of the parties; or (ii) at the trial, where a subpoena or corresponding process has been served calling for the production of the documents at the trial. 6. 'In both cases the essential matter is that the decision to object should be taken by the Minister who is the political head of the department, and that he should have seen and considered the contents of the documents and himself have formed the view that on grounds of public interest they ought not to be produced, either because of their.actual contents or because of the class of documents—for example, departmental minutes—to which they belonged. Instances may arise where it is not convenient or practicable for the political Minister to act (for example, he may be out of reach or ill or the department may be one where the effective head is a permanent official), and in such cases it would be reasonable for the objection to be taken, as it has often been taken in the past, by the permanent head. If the question arises before trial the objection will ordinarily be taken by affidavit, and a good example is provided for the affidavit of the First Lord of the Admiralty in the present case. If the question arises on the subpoena at the hearing, it is not uncommon in modern practice for the Minister's objection to be conveyed to the Court, at any rate in the first instance, by an official of the department who produces a certificate which the Minister has signed, stating what is necessary. ( 21 ) A tribunal of enquiry had been held, presided over by Bucknill J., on the sinking of the Thetis, and some of the documents asked for had been produced there, and reference was made in the report of Bucknill J. to some of these documents. It was argued that these at any rate could be produced, but the Lord Chancellor held that this special circumstance should not affect the question as special precautions might have been taken at the enquiry to avoid public injury, and some portion of the tribunal's sitting might have been held in secret, and the report did not set out the documents in extenso.I see no harm in this procedure provided it is understood that this is only for convenience and that, if the Tourt is not satisfied by this method, it can request the Minister's personal attendance.'' 7. The approved practice (in spite of some statements in cases to the contrary) in Scotland and in England is to treat the objection taken in proper form on behalf of the Crown as conclusive and not for the Judge to look at the document himself privately and then decide. It is for the Judge who is in control of the trial and not the executive to decide, but the proper ruling for the Judge to give is that this objection by the Crown is conclusive. The decision to the contrary of the Privy Council in Rohinson v. the State of South Australia No. 2 (47 T.L.R. 454) was expressly disapproved and the Lord Chancellor stated that Lord Justice Scrutton had been misinformed when he was told, as recorded in Ankin's case (46 T.L.R. 172) that the practice on this point in Scotland differed from that in England. 8. Paragraphs 3-7 above deal with the position in civil actions. The practice in criminal trials where an individual's life or liberty is at stake is not necessarily the same. 9. Lord Simon concludes by giving an explanation as to the way in which Ministers who have to decide whether objection to production on the ground of public interest should be taken or^not should consider the matter. Lord Simon's words on this point deserve quotation 'In this connexion, I do not think that it is out of place to indicate the sort of grounds which would not afford to the Minister adequate justification for objecting to production. It is not a sufficient ground that tJte documents are 'State Documents' or 'official' or are marked confidential. It would not he a good ground that, if theg were produced, the consequences might invoice the department or the Government in Parliamentarij discussion or in public criticism, or might necessitate the attendance as witnesses or otherwise of officials who have pressing duties elsewhere. Neither would it be a good ground that production might tend to expose a want of efficiency in the administration or tend to lag the department open to claims for compensation. In a word, it is not enough that the Minister or the department does not want to have the documents produced. ' The Minister, in deciding whether it is his dutg to object, should bear these considerations in mind, for he ought not to take the responsibility of withholding production except in cases uhere the public interest would otherwise he damnified—for example, where disclosure would he injurious to national defence, or to good diplomatic relations, or where the practice of keeping a class of documents secret is necessary for the proper functioning of the public service. II hen these conditions dre aatisfied and t}ie Minister feels it is his duty to deny ■ access to material which would otherwise be available, there is no question hut that the public interest must be preferred to any private consideration. I he present opinion is concerned only with the production of documents, but it seems to me that the same principle must also apply to the exclusion of verbal evidence which, if given, would jeopardise the interests of the community. Indeed, Lord Eldon s language, above quoted, implies this. After all, the public interest is also the interest of every subject of the realm, and while, in these exceptional cases, the private citizen may seem to be denied what is to his immediate advantage, he, like the rest of us, would suffer if the needs of protecting the interests of the country as a whole were not ranked as a prior obligation.' a W.

The Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gnlf, Bushire . is 8 Hi . 2-3 New Delhi, 26th June 1944. Sir, 1 am directed to say that printed copies of Volumes I and II of Lorimer's Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia, were distributed to the authorities shown in the appended statement. 2. Originally the gazetteer was classed as 'Secret' but in 1922 it was decided to re-classlfy it as a ' For Official Use Only' publicatiori. It has however been brought to the notice of the Government of India that this gazetteer contains many oassages which should not be available outside limited official circles, and sufficient precautions are not being observed by holders to prevent ig from falling into the hands of unauthorised persons. It has therefore been decided that it should be re-classed as 'Secret' as indeed it is marked on the cover in bold letters. Due precautions in regard to its custody, handing etc. should then be observed in accordance with ' classification and Handling of Protected Documents (India), 1943. 3. In view of this re-classification the Government of India would be glad to be informed at an early date of the number of copies now in your possession and/or in the possession of the subordinate posts with which you are concerned, and to have confimation that the appropriate notice ( copy attached ) has been affixed to the front of each copy. The Government of India would also be grateful for any information that might be available with you as to the disposal of copies of the Gazetteer originally supplied to posts no longer in existence, e.g. Political Resident, Turkish-Arabia, and the Directorates of the Persian Gulf and India-European Telegraphs. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd. H. Dayal. Under Secretary to the Government of India. CQjj V TDKii'j.'
