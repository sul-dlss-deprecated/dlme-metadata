To save time proceed straight on shore to house of Residency Agent, make any communication to Sheikh Sagar which your examination of the position at Abu Musa may render necessary. xx x x x P. Z. C 7/11/07.,P. R. A Hi Tiie following is a report of my proceedings on your instructions dated 7/11/07 (original attached). The Redbreast arrived at Abu Musa Island at 7 a.m. on 9/11/07. No activity was visible on shore. At 9 a.m. I landed with* Captain Hose. We were met near the oxide heap on the shore by the Sheikh's caretaker Ghulam a Persian from Lingah who informed us he had been in charge from a period anterior to the commencement of operations by Hassan bin Someiya. He informed, me that there were no armed men on the Island, the only persons there besides himself being some half-dogen Shargah Arabs in charge of goats. Brotto's visit . The caretaker witnessed the whole affair from the beach and it was he who called out to Brown, by the Sheikh's' order. The 'Lapwing' left in the morning and on the a.fternoon of the same day Brown arrived in a sailing craft flying the German Flag and anchored off the oxide heap. He came towards the shore in a small boat r with one Persian servant beside the boatmen.' As he approached the shore the guards came down and the caretaker called out that he could not land. He still came on and two shots were fired in the air. The boat then stopped and Brown expostulated, saying he merely wished to see how matters stood.Two men from the boat were allowed to land and went up to the house built by Hassan about mile from the beach where they saw the Sheikh (Atdulla bin Ahmed 1st cousin of Sheikh Sagar). He repeated his refusal to allow Brown to land and the latter returned to his ship and left the same evening. The landing should be noted, as it makes it impossible for the Germans to allege direct British participation in the repulse of Brown. SsJiEisojl* The original force of 60 men with its commandercorfimander left 5 days after 'the Lapwing's departure. Next morning 20 men without any man of importance arrived- They remained only two days, and then left apparently of their own motion. They complained af that the Sheikh was not feeding them. Since then no guards had teen present at all. Pr ope r ty o f J l assan - List,*- baggarahs, •&lt; jolly- boats, 1 wooden capstan, about 100 baskets, 4 wooden certs, 1 iron cart, ? bullocks, 20 donkeys. The caretaker asked for instructions with regard to the bullocks, one of which he showed me. He said there was no grass on the island, and Hassan had been feeding them on bhusa which was stored in a locked go-down, of which the key was said to be with Hassan. He asked whether the godown should not be opened. Seeing that the bullock was emaciated and showed every sign of starvation, I thought this reasonable and had the godown opened in my presence. It contain ed nothing but a heap og loose bhusa and about a dozen sa.cks containing date-stones and dried fish. I satisfied myself that there was nothing of value in the godown and authorised the caretaker to utilise the contents for feeding the cattle.} It is of course possible that he merely wished to feed his own ani mals, but the claim for the entire contents of the godown would be less than the value of one bullock, besides the inhumanity of allowing them to starve. Another godown, the door of which had been wall ed up with gatch was stated to contain food-stuffs of various kinds for labourers. The large iron cart which could not have been transported in a native boat was taknn to pieces by Captain Hose's direct ions. As it seemed of some importance to be able to check the eventual claim for the oxide already ex tracted., I requested Captain Hose to have the quan tity estimated. The heap was accordingly roughly measuredmeasured by Ae&amp;iag Engineer Jenkins, the cubic capa city calculated and a small portion weighed against an equal bulk of' coal. In the result, Mr. Jenkins ■{! estimated the total quantity at 2000 tons. No gear had been removed by the Sheikh. b'lagstaff. No steps had been taken to provide or erect this. A spar had already been prepared by Captain Hose and brought ashore. I therefore left it under the oxide heap. Captain Hose informed me that it was unnecessary for the Residency to pay for it. G eneral . The expenses incurred by Hassan cannot have been heavy. The road from the mine to the shore (about l'|- miles) was made merely by laying undressed local stone., which is soft. The 'mine' is imi an open quarry, worked with crowbars, the oxide being extracted in blocks which apparently soon disinte grate. Another heap of oxide slightly smaller than the one on the beach stands ready for carting close to the quarray. The caretaker asked for instructions in the event of the German or Hassan returning while the place was without a garrisdm, stating that some.5 sailing vessels had already taken shelter behind the island since the departure of the men, and the news of this would soon spread. I told him to inform anyone who landed on Hassan's behalf that their presence was not permitted by the Sheikh, who would certainly s expel them as before. He enquired whether the flag to be hoisted would be a British Flag or th&amp;t of the Jowasiiii y and was told the latter. (II). Shar^ah. We. arrived at dawn on 10/11/07. Usa bin Abdul Latif came off to meet us. Captain Hose and I landed and went to the Agency. Abdul Latif was' lying down and complained of pains' in the legs and head, but was quite master- of himself. He said nothing about his eyes failing. After some time Sheikh Sagar arrivedarrived, and soon after him. Sheikh Salim. This ilas unfortunate as I had wished to discuss the Abu Musa affair in the absence of the latoer, who was mani festly in opposition. The Sheikh's excuse for re moving the guards was that it was a hardship for them to be at Abu Musa during Ramzan and they had return ed for the Id, and further that he thought them unnecessary as Brown had gone to pursue his complaint at Bushire. I pointed out the extreme probability that the news of the defenceless state of the island t. would easily reach Hassan at Lingah, and reproachea the Sheikh for vacillation and causing trouble to the Sirkar. He said he was quite ready to send a ship and would do so the same evening, a statement which Abdul Latif appeared to credit. Sheikh Salim inter vened. in the conversation several times: he said Abdulla bin Hassan had threatened the arrival of a German ship of war, and asked what would happen in that event. - This was laughed down aa a ridiculous boast. He then said that Brown had stated at Debai (in passing by on the slow mail) that he would claim 7 lakhs of rupees or the right to mine on the is land in default, as he had entered into contracts in Europe which he would be forced to break. He also said that he would claim the expense of sending 3 German men-of-war. Abdul Latif countered this by asking if it ?7as wisdom to give propertj' - worth 7 lakhs for 200 reals a year. Sheikh Salim did not seem to me to be smarting under the loss of his 200 reals so much as alarmed by Abdulla's tall talk, and afraid of the whole affair. The hand of 'Mirza Abul Kassim is probably to be seen in this. Abdul- Latif had already written to 'Oebai advising his expulsion. Sheikh Sagar asked for my advice.in the event of Brown or Hassan attempting to force a landing. I replied that this was extremely improbable, and overs'' attempt must be made to induce them to withdraw without violence, but if they insisted on landing thev '% ■ -r' the Sheikii was fully w£thin his rights in keeping his island free of them, and any harm that might ensue would be on their heads. I impressed upon him the absolute.necessity of not allowing them to land, and thus reopen the whole trouble. On the matter of the flagstaff being explained, he thanked Captain Hose and said he would have it erected. x xxx xx fte then returned on board and having some.misgivings as to the Sheikh's intentions I sent Abdur Rezak on shore again at once to watch events. Captain Hose and I landed about 4-30 and went to the fort. The boat and 20 men were said to be ready, but still in the creek and the tide too low to get her out till midnight. The intention of the Sheikh seemed manifest;it was to say that the W. W. swell then running made it impossible for the boat to get out next morning. At last I spoke very sharply (in private) to Sheikh Sagar, gave him till next day at dawn to get the men off, and told him that if he did not I would telegraph to you that he refused to lift a hand in his own cause and Government's help, was wasted on him, and also that I was sure you would be much displeased as it was. I then arranged to leave E'sa on shore, with instructions to come off in the dhow with the armed men to the 'Redbreast' which would tow the dhow if necessary. Next morning at dawn the dhow came off, and the wind being fair from the shore she was directed to go to Abu Musa. Lisa sent a message to his father by my direction that he should report to me at 'nebai on the following Friday whether the men were still at the island. We then left for Umm-el-Kowein. liote. At our last interview. Sheikh Salim was pre sent for part of the time. Sheikh Sagar repeated the argument about the German having gone to Bushire, andi, and asked how long he was 'to keep a guard on 'the island. T told him, until he heard from you., 'bhat it was safe Lo withdraw it. He then asked to receive instructions before the end of this Muhammadan month. I said he. would certainly hear from you before then. I thought it hopeless to raise the question of the removal of the gear, as the Sheikh will never do it unless someone stands over him. x x x x x x x x x x x As regards Abu Musa, the Sheikh of Shargah will cer tainly expect some communication from you by the next opportunity, but its tenour will of course depend on the, character of Abdul Latif's report. x x x x x J.

I submit in any case that this question is one between the partners themselves and can not be said to oe any concern of the Germans, whose complaint is against the action the Sheikh of Shargah , which is based not on the question whether third partner did or did not agree to the German contract but on the fact that the said contract conferred a monopoly , which the concessionaires ,whether two or three.2. jr N ; had no power to give and to which the Sheikh altogether objected. The following are the facts reported regarding the alleged firing on Brown. On the S2nd of October the son of the Lingah concessionaire the and HXH miners of the latter were evicted from the mines ► and despatched to Lingah and a strong guard was then left by the Sheikh of Shargah on the island with orders not to allow anyone to land at the mines. Mr. Brown,meanwhile,having previously sent to the Sheikh a letter threatening to send over his own employes n to Bgetect our property J' and having it is said informed persons in Lingah before leaving that it was his intention ► to plant the German flag on the oxide mines, proceeded in a native boat flying the German flag to the island and anchored off the oxide mines. In spite of repeated warning shouted to him by the Sheikh's guard that he would not be allowed to land he persisted in trying to do so, and the guard therefore fired two shots in the air to deter him as he neared the shore. On his making expostulations at this and giving them assur- r ances that he only wished to see how matters stood two of his men were allowed by the guard to land and see all they wanted to and the men were then escorted by the guard ifa-' back to the boat ; after which Mr Brown set sail back again for Lingah.

Both concessionaires aRsijWho are naturalized British subjects and Wonkhaus , are well aware that the Sheikh is under the Political jurisdiction of the Resdient. Wonckhaus himself invoked the assistance of the Resident in a somewhat similar cause (case ?) in Bahrein in 1905 • Departure from ordinary procedure and previous precedent on his part in this sacxs instance appears indicative of some ulterior motive from outset# We trusted that the case would be discussed in London ( vide our telegram to the Minister at Teheran dated the 17th of November No: 12 C ) since we anticipated that otherwise a revival of the Persian claims to the island might be instigated by the German Minister.2. iff Our expectation as to this has now been fulfilled, ( vide 0 6' A telegram, to the Foreign Office dated the 6th of Jan: No: 6 ) and it therefore seems particularly desirable that further discussion of the case at Teheran should if possible be stopped. If incident is likely to be further protracted , we would venture to recommend that Marling should inform the German Minister that the Trucial Chiefs are under the jurisdiction of the Eesident and that complaints of their proceedings should , at any rate in the first instance , be preferred to him. The fact that Wonckhaus' agent has endeavoured to deal direct with the Sheikh in the matter , and has throughout made no reference to the Persian B Govt: should make it difficult for the Germans to press for interference by Persia at this stage* The facts of the case are well known at Bushire and Brown has the assistance there of the German Consul.

In replying to my letter of 26tb. January Consul for the Government of Gerraany generally has agreed to my proposals and intimates that Firm would like to send ship about middle of March. It is explained by him however that the oxide is not actually ready for shipment as we understood but that greater portion of it has still to be cleaned. In order to carry out this operation the firm wishes to place a large number of coolies on the island for three weeks before arrival of steamer and I have been requested to guarantee that these coolies are not hindered or molested. I replied that I am ready to do my utmost to remove difficulties but that in view of the fact that firm would not have any practi cal control over these coolies it is difficult to give formal guarantee for state of things the preservation of which depends upon good conduct of firm's coolies as well as that of Sheikhs retainers. I order to simplify matters and obviate necessity of such a guarantee it has been sugges ted by me subject to the approval of the Govern ment of India which I anticipate, that as T.'onck- haus would in all probability arrange for coolie labour to be supplied by Hassan Samaiyeh, I should after securing the Bheikh's concurrence inform Hassan qua British subject that he is at liberty to carry out the cleaning and subsequent loading for Messrs Wonckhaus. ConsulConsul for the Government/ of Germany provision ally agrees. I hope Government of India will approve and will telegraph reply as time is short for arrangement. I will send Agent to remain on island during the period 'but to give official guarantee would involve the location of one of our vessels of war for the whole period which appears to 'be unnecessary. i Cox).Telegram 3?0 Foreign Calcutta No: 116 dated / ^ Fo/s-oV* (pju The Abu Musa case. /&lt;r 1^5' dl i \l The value of the accumulation which Jhe German firm is going to remove must be about 1500 £ • According to the terms of the contract half may have been paid already and half should be paid on shipment.

Please see Foreign Department telegram dated 29th January No. S.55. (1). There is on my record absolutely no evidence sug gesting that the ownership of the island or mines rests with Sheikh Salem. There is ample evidence on the con trary to show that the island is the recognised property of that section of the Jowasim tribe which inhabits the pirate coast of which the ruling Chief of Shargah is the . head and in whom are vested all quasi sovereign and territorial rights. The present Sheikh has, according to Residency records, never failed to keep .an eye on these rights by documentary assertion, and it was for him as Sheikh of the Jowasim that in 1904 we recovered the island and not for Sheikh Salem. In letter to Resident in 1902 when no dispute existed regarding the concession the Sheikh wrote to the Resident that the concession had been granted by Sheikh Salem while acting as regent during his own temporary absence. It has been held that Sheikh Salem, since his ejection from the Sheikhship in 1883 has possessed no rights of jurisdiction either on Abu Musa or anywhere else, and he has merely been a pensioner in receipt of a stipend from the ruling Sheikh on condition of his loyalty and obedience. This stipend was first fixed by a documentary agreement a copy of which was forwarded with this Residency letter dated 6th August 1883 No. 165. Sheikh Sagar having failed to make a regular payment of this allowance Shiekh Salem on 16th June 1884 visited the Residency Agent and stating himself to be in absolute poverty besought the Agent to induce the SheikhSheikh to provide him with a bare eubsistence allowance. The efforts of the Sheikh resulted in the substitition of a second agreement which was reported in this office letter dated 10th July 1884 No. 134. In 1888 this was again broken but by the Residency Agent's good offiees, a third agree - ment was executed by KkE± which Sheikh Salem was allowed to return to Shargah iaax received a fixed allowance of 400 dollars per annum and obtained employment as the Vazier or adviser of his nephew. So far as we knew this document and arramgement still hold good. The presumption is that Sheikh Salem is allowed to receive as padfct part of his pension the 250 dollars coming annually from the Concession aires, but without enquiry at Shargah I cannot say this for certain. Sheikh Sagar in any case has no power to alienate any sovereign territorial rights in Abu Musa which he him self only enjoys as Ruling Chief of the Joawsim tribe , and if any document making over such rights has been passed to \ Sheikh Salem, we are under obligation in the interests of the principality to have it cancelled as having been granted ultra vires. It is a recognised custom on the other tmnd in all such eastern principalities for the ruling Chief who has to maintain numerous relations to give them instead of cash allowances enjoyment of landed property within the State. This is a family arrangement purely and can at the will of the ruler be suspended at any time. An alienation UaJL of such property by his relative would be a violation in the case of our protected Chiefs the Ruling Chiefs'cr treaty obligations to us. (2). I hope it wifcl be possible to obtain copies of German^ enclosures 4d and 4e. (3). Comment will follow after my visit to Shargah re garding the queltion of non-consent of all the parties. (4) . n The transfer oti the 10th October of share to Brown. As the whole concession was cancelled on the 21st February no rights were any longer possessed by Hassan Samaiyeh which he could transfer on the 10th October. The transfer is dated the same day as the final notice to quit, and thethe presumption is that Brown and Hassan concocted these letters on seeing that the Sheikfe meant business. I will make endeavours to obtain further information. It should be noted here that whereas in addressing Legation the German Minister called Brown a German subject, the German Case repeatedly calls him a British subject and probably has a motive in doing so. Brown speaks English with G erman accent and was born and bred in Germany and to the best of my belief either Womckhaus or he himself informed me some years ago that he was a naturalised German. He has at ail events never registered himself or referred to the British Consulate in any way. Please not^ as regards German Enclosure 4c that the words 'share of oxide m ines* are inaccurate both in the German transition and in that forwarded with my letter dated 16th December m - , ,w. No. 3052. The Arabic to be strictly accurate should be rendered 'share in oxide company' and no mention of mines is made in the deed. Regarding the above please also see the Administration Reports ©f this Residency for the years 1883, 1884, 1886, 1887, 1888,ml889, and 1898.

Are you of opinion that you could induce Nejef to lodge with you as British Consul a written or oral complaint against Hassan Samaiyeh a British subjefct for violating agreement come to with complainant's late father and continued to himself; firstly by executing agreement with German firm without his know^ledge or concurrence and secondly by not giving him any share of the proceeds. Such a complaint might prove useful but would have to be brought about very circumspectly. Perhaps some confidential native agent of yours could get Nejef to make the complaint by suggesting that you might be able to recover for him some of the profits. If he heard of it the Karguzar would probably block the matter because Abu Musa is claimed by the Persian GovtJ, so it might be dangerpus to risk his intervention. It would be advisable for you to record incidentally specific evidence of the fact that rights of the deceased Nakhoda All under this agreement had de scended to his son. It would also be convenient if a statement were to be included by Nejef in his complaint regarding an attempt having been made without success by the German Mirza and Abdulla-bin- Hassan to induce him to sign a document testifying ~,rm -• — r mumXXI c\ Telegram..;' # / \ wf0 TO , Foreign , • Calcutta Ho, , 132 , dated 14-2-08 (P).

The German contract was kept secret at the express bidding of Mr. Brown. I have a written statement in original by Hassan Samaiyeh to this effect. Much less was it ever registered in a British Court or attested by li / the British Agent at Lingah. The Trucial Chiefs have standing injunctions not to give concessions without con sulting' British Authorities. In order to prevent these unsophisticated Arabs from getting exploited by unscrupu lous persons, this is very necessary. Clause (S3). The latter to which German enclosure 6 is a mmamrnHmmmmmmm reply and which is carefully omitted by them, did not for- ward a copy of the document at all, but merely gave a gar bled report. The third partner,who knows no English^ saw it was objectionable and repudiated it directly he received a copy and got it translated into Arabic. The sentence 'Ann- -■ N ulment is preferable to its continuance' is a polite way of saying 'It should be .annulled'. It is possible, in view of the fact that the contract was in English that Hassan himself never understood it accurately, or perhaps was given by Brown an incorrect Arabic translation of it.

Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to my letter No.0/58, dated the 28th.November,1C07, on the subject of the unsuccessful attempt made by the German Consulate Munshi and Abdulla bin Hassan Somaiyeh to induce Nejef bin Ali to sign a document to the Effect that he was cognisant of and consented to, the agreement between Hassan bin Ali Somaiyeh and the German firm of Wonckhaus. S. In view of the persistent refusal of Hassan bin Ali Somaiyeh to produce any statement of account for the information of his co-concessionaires and of his unauthorised action in granting a monopoly to the German firm, Nejef bin H Ali has now lodged a formal complaint at this Consulate again- -st Hassan bin Ali Somaiyeh, who is a British Subject. This petition I enclose in original with a rough translated purpo- -rt for your information. 3. In view of this representation, I have the honour to suggest that pending a settlement of account between iry petitioner and Hassan bin Ali Somaiyeh, such of the mining implements as remain at Abu Musa, be retained in custody, with a view to eventual sale and the handing of the proceeds w to Nejef bin Ali. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant. Lieutenant,.Bough purport, of a petition from Nejef bin Ali, Persian Subject of Bunder Abbas, to H.B.M's Consul, Bunder Abbas, dat e d trie 16tii. February, 1C 0 3, A. 0. My Fatrier for some years performed service for tne British and as Ha j i Hassan bin Ali Somaiyen of Ling all is a Britisb Subject, I txieresPore petition to you as follows:- Goncerning the Abu Musa Oxide, for which there were 4 Concessionaires among whom, I hold the deed of partnership of my father. My Father had no other heir but myself and there- -fore, after his death, Haji Hassan bin Ali acknowledged my right of partnership as acquired through my Father. At the time when Hassan entered into the agreement with Messrs. WoncMiaus, he gave me no information whatever on the subject. Subsequently, I made an arrangement with Haji Amin-ut-Tujjar 'bo sell tiim Oxide and sent word 'bo Hassan to bhis effect. Hassan bhen vnrobe me bhab he had made a conbracb elsewhere &gt;5i. fe. J*. a- ^ -f lie iv \#r&gt;» and vfould I nform me regarding: it later• az proof that I aid not in any way agree to this contract made by Hassan, I point to the fact that it dad not bear my signature and when some f months later, Abdulla bin Hassan and the German Munshi came and asked me to sign it in token of assent, I refused to do so, as I had not been consulted in the first place• As further proof of my rightin bhe concession, I may menbion bhab in 1C04 Abdulla bin Hassan had a case in Calcutta against Messrs. Sassoon concerning the Abu Musa Oxide, but seeing that the oxide had been sold in the name of my Father, the case could not be proceeded with until I had furnished a power of attorney for the Calcutta Court a copy of this is doubtless in your Consulate records. (Note by H.B.M 1 s Consul:— the Consulate fee book shows that Nejef 'paid 5/- fees for the execution of a power of attorney on the SCth.October,1C04). Now I complain that from the time that Hassan has been activ- —ely engaged in the oxide work of Bu Musa, I have not received- one Dinar of the proceeds, although all the work on the Islandformerly devolved, upon iny Father, who himself found the imple- -ments, etc., for working the oxide, which implements are even now at the Island. Besides all this, there were 250- carpets which belonged to my Father and which were sent to Calcutta for sale. Atd- -ulla tin Hassan wanted to settle up the account for them in Calcutta, but until I gave a power of attorney, they would not settle with him. Hassan subsequently collected all the money, but I have never been able to recover any of it from him. How I pray you of your goodness to look after my rights and to obtain me justice against Hassan.
