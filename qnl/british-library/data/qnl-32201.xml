I am told that a tentative start was made some months ago; this has developed until the end of, I think, October, when operations may be said to be in accordance with the tenns of the Heed of Modification of Mining Lease date d 19th June, 1940 L irticle 8). As you know, the moratorium results in the extension of the period of the Lease and relevant obiigaticns . The questions arising, to my mind at the moment, are:- (a) the length of the moratorium period, e.g. when the moratorium may be said to have ended, and (b) what forni of record (if any) the moratorium and consequential prolongation should take. As to the recommencement of operations for the purposes of the Lease, perhq)s you would be good enough to ascertain the vievjs of the Political Resident as to this. I do not anticipate any uiTferenee of opinion arising on this. As to the record, I think that as the consequences of the moratorium follow automatically upon the termination of the moratorium, it is sufficient if the parties record, by an exchange of letters, the date of the agreed-upon termination and the date of commencement, or, to put it shortly, that the moratorium ran for so many years and months. Do you agree? Yours P.A.K.Harrison Msq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. ely, faTELEPHONE. HOLBORN 8434. The Bahrein Petroleum Company, Limited. Cliffords Inn, Dear Mr. Harrison, 10th January, 1947.

Ltd., which, as you may remember, was and is a wholly-owned Sub sidiary of the Standard Oil Company of California. The new Company is the Subsidiary of that Corporation and of The Texas Company. The United Overseas Petroleum Co., Ltd., has an Initial Capital of £25,000, divided into 25,000 shares of £1 each, of which 10,000 shares have been subscribed for in full and taken up by or on behalf of the two Parent Corpora tions. The Company f s Executive Officers are:- H.M.Herron; C.E.Olmsted; J.H.MacGaregill; ./.H.Pinckard; P. A. Da vies; E.M. Butterworth and A.P.Carter. Admiral A.P.Carter is the Director resident in London; and Mr.Prank G. Keefe is the Manager in London. The present address of the Company is a temporary one at 34 Millbank, S.W.l; the Company hope to iinove into more suitable premises at the end of September, the,. address beingHiq Company was incorporated on the 13th October 1S45; it has operated as from the 1st June, 1946. Its activities are necessarily wider than those of the California Standard Oil Company inasmuch as it will purchase large q quan tities of machinery and material in Gt.

Dear Harrison, Would you please refer to your letter of the 15th July to ^arrell, who is on leave,,on the subject of the estimated oil reserves of the Bahrein Petroleum Company in Bahrein. Obviously, the Bahrein Petroleum Company should be in a better position than anybody else to assess the reserves of the oilfield which they are working and as the chief local representative has agreed that the Bahrein Grovemment could be informed that at the present rate of withdrawal the oil-field could be expected to last until the expiry of the Company's present concession, i.e. 49 years, his estimate is, presumably, a considered one.. We can, therefore, see no reason why this should not be passed on to the Bahrein Government. At the same time, if this estimate is being used in considering the financial programme of the Bahrein Government for a long period ahead, it may be desirable that they should bear in mind that oilfield reserves are not susceptible of the same accurate estimation as is possible for solid minerals. Present American practice in the estimation of oil reserves is usually conservative, but the whole question is subject to technical uncertainties. Moreover, the question also arises of the continued existence of a market outlet for Bahrein oil. The same American Group controls both Bahrein and Saudi Arabian production and, as you know, the potential output of crude oil from Arabia is very large, while at present the Group's refining facilities in Bahrein and at Ras Tanura on the mainland are relatively limited. The position of the Group in relation to world markets is also, broadly speaking, that of a new-comer who will have to mRira his own way in competing for sales outlets. Consequently, it is not /really•S'X # * n i z' 7W&gt; V really possible to foretell with any certainty what the position as regards marketing of Bahrein oil will be over a period as long as the term of the BAPCO concession* The assumption that Bahrein oil can be produced and marketed at the present rate for a good many years to come is probably reasonable, but it remains an assumption* I am sorry to be so full of reservations, but with the centre of gravity in the oil world tending to shift from the Gulf of Mexico to the Middle East, it is difficult to prognosticate on the long term prospects of individual sources of supplies* Yours sincerely, t -- w &lt; • ■* * * « , (Sgd) K.N.Stock.

We passed on the gist of your letter to the Political Resident and have now had a reply from him saying that before receipt of our letter he had asked Russell Brown, the Chief Local Representative of the Bahrein Petroleum Company for an estimate of the probable life of the oilfield. The latter replied that he was confident that at the present rate of withdrawal the oilfield would last another 70 years. He also said that he saw no objection to the Political Agent informing the Bahrein Government that at the present rate of withdrawal the oilfield could be expected to last for at least another fifty years, that is to say, until after the expiry of the present concession, which has still 49 years to run. 3. I take it that your objection to /o ommunicat ing I.W.Farrell Esq., Petroleum Division, Ministry of Fuel &amp; Power, 7 Millbank, S.W.l.communicating to the Bahrein Government the figures in your letter of 11th June will not extend to the company's own estimate in the last sentence of paragraph 2 above but perhaps you will confirm this.

Before receipt of your letter we had asked R u ssell Brown the Chief Local Representative of the Bahrain Petroleum Company to give us an estimate of the probable life of the Bahrain oilfield.

He also stated that he saw no objection to our informing the Bahrain Government that at the present rate of withdrawal the oilfield could be expected to last for at least another 50 years, that is to say until after the expiry of the present Concession which has still 49 years to run. 3. In view of what is stated in paragraph 3 of your letter would you kindly let me know whether there is any objection to this information being passed on by Galloway to the Bahrain Government. I consider it important that it should be passed on as Belgrave’s ultra-conservative financial policy is due in part to a belief that the oil field will only last for another 15 years. It is suggested in the paragraph of your letter referred to that the Bahrain Government should themselves ask the Company for information but this would appear to be against the spirit if not the letter of Article XVI of the Agreement of 29th December 1934 E.P.Donaldson,E s q., CMG-. /between India Office./ X'4 • c r\\ MJ\/ between Shaikh Hamad and the Company and Article k of the Political Agreement made between H.24.G-. and the Company on —, 29th June 1940.

V’e thank you for your letter No. C/ 940 dated 12t h July 1943 informing us that the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited has requested us to g rant to the Comnany a moratorium in respect of the Company’s obligations, which are described in Article 5 of the Deed of Further Modification dated 19th June 1940, owing to circumstances of war. 2. 0 are aware that the war has brought about conditions which make it difficult at present for the Company to carry out its work in the additional area. For this reason we are willing to agree to the Company* s request. 3. We agree that for such time as the war makes it impossible for the Company to carry out its obligations under Article 5 we will grant a mora torium. We do not mean by this con cession that the moratorium shall necessarily extend until the end of the war; indeed we trust that before the war has come to an end in all parts of the World conditions in the United States of America and elsewhere and especially shipping facilities will have improved to such an extent that* • m i [Ilk — T— l i &gt;%{ J U^UtsJbz M 0*J — J —t-u^ 4&gt;« (Jt * iSLJt\j\j I HIT -»—»ti jo*s-L, &lt;J&lt; - ?-Uil io——4 i* «L^Jl #q —ftj * d w^—tt &lt;&gt;&lt; 't* b«—«ojl— j&gt;\ 4 U j)I—: ijljt i—iif j LJI 't 1 ^ JD o ^ O 4 y •* '-ij ^r&gt; l^l jU* ji * 1 ^ «%» !■ JL&gt;xj -.i» 1 (N^ i *i^J p-~Mt lj J Lt *^—-^ vj^ j('&amp; |liw i/f o^; ^1 J^b»- i&gt;*i—i-Ui #j— *,j* 0 I w J^\ U&gt;11 ^l^-uil^. 4_— i;viijjI jj; La^L^m iiAL-iJ &lt;j—ljuj • Ujjl^ Ji ^ J^-o^. iA*L—j La^ 1 *»l l&lt; ^b ^ ^0^ ^&gt;JJ j^ ^ ,1, f |^^U l^- Ul^ Jf &gt;iU lOA crsu - 2 - the Company will b e able to resume its normal work in Bahrain. 4. We also agree that the period of the moratorium shall commence as from 1st December 1942 and that the lease dated 19th June 1940 shall be extended by a period equal to the period of the mora torium. 5. In this connection we should like to point out that the war has added much to the cost of the administration of our country; in the interests of our people we have b een compelled to become the pro vider of^our country* s foodstuffs and instead of being able to add to the State*s Reserve Fund we are using all available money for buying supplies for the country. Owing to the war we have had to increase our armed farces to pro tect our oil fields. In this and in many other directions the war has been res ponsible for increasing expenditure anal at the same time our revenue has decreas ed. We therefore take this opportunity of urging the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited to endeavour to increase the out put of Bahrain oil so that oitr revenue may increase in proportion to the greater expenditure made necessary owing to the war.

In the case of the Mosul Petroleum Company default had not actually taken place at the time of the agreement with the Iraqi Government but had been rendered inevitable by orders for the removal of equipment and the plugging of wells issued by the Military Authorities in 1941. In the case of the Basrah Petroleum Company default had already taken place and was due to the refusal of H*M*G. to agree to the raising of additional capital, to provide the necessary dollar exchange or to give export licences for equipment and materials required for the war effort. &lt; Us J ? The Iraqi Government refused to accept the Company’s plea of force majeure despite the 'intervention of H*M. Ambassador at Bagdad on the Company^s'behalf, and after protracted negotiations the Compariy'agreed to make substantial loans without interest rather than run any risk of losing their concessions through an arbitration award. Their decision was to some extent influenced by the fact that, unlike the Bahrein Concession, both the concessions in Iraq were subject to international arbitration through the Hague Court. It should also be noted that the final settlement took the fona of an amendment to each concession, confirmed R . T. Peel, Esq., C.B.E. , India Office, by/ India Office, Whitehall, S.W.1.

Moreover, inasmuch as the British , Ambassador pressed the Iraqi Government to accept the- Companies’ plea of force majeure in the case of the two Companies in Iraq, I feel that we should do our best to exercise equal pressure on the Sheikh of Bahrein in support of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, even though in the former case such pressure did not prove effective. It could, I think, be explained to the Sheikh that the Bahrein Petroleum Company are not asking that the moratorium should cover so long a period as in the case of the Iraqi Companies and that it was for this extension that the loan was justified rather than for the moratorium itself. It could also be added that if the Company are unwilling to make an additional payment in respect of Bahrein, his only recourse would be submit the matter to an arbitration which would be costly and which he would almost certainly lose.

In the instructions^from New York to Anderson on February 11th the corresponding phrase read 'lease on additional area'* Ballantyne, however, feels strongly, for % the reasons given at the end of paragraph 2 of our telegram No* 771, that the extension must apply to the whole area; and he therefore suggested to New York, in a cable dated February 16th, that the words 'on/“on additional area” should be omitted* The Company apparently followed his advice* 4.

(PETROLEUM DEPARTMENT,) Jj^ar peel \ In answer, to your letter of December - 24th, as I hope to tell you by telephone this morning, y/e agree in general to your pursuing the matter on the Tines of paragraph 3. of your letter. I entirely agree with you that it is not correct to assume that the Conrpany ^ : ish to. discontinue drilling for con-^i-derations of their own convenience. Indeed, if they did intend to drill in the outside area, we should certainly v/ish to take action to prevent it. There is, as you probably know, a very great shortage of drilling equipment throughout the world and it is essential that_it should be economically used. Part of the proved Bahrein production has :iad to be shut back for wartime reasons and it would therefore be inadmissible to indulge in exploratory drilling to discover fresh sources of oil. If a force maieur case does not already exist, there is therefore every reason why we should bring it about by issuing The necessary edicts in the most suitable manner. I would remind you that all drilling has been discontinued, not only in the proved fields in Iraq and Persia but also in unproved areas such as those of the %aS\oJs Bagda-4- Petroleum Company, Kuwait and gatar. I believe, on the other hanl, that drilling is still continuing in Saudi Arabia which is a pity, but we have no jurisdiction over this area. It may R. T. Peel, Esq., C.3.S. , India Office, Whitehall, S.W.1.It may well iDe that the Bahrein Petroleum Company rill wish to insist that they be granted not only a moratorium in respect of* Article 5» but also a corres ponding extension of the period of the lease. This would be only fair under all the circumstances and* is the line t nat - ' 3 been taxen up oy the Bag lad./pet roleu .i ; Jrir obhy, /jU. ; I o? bxa] ^ le, (which is a subsidiary of the Iraci Petroleum Company;. On the other hand, I note from telegram from the Political Resident in the Persian Culf,^para.&gt;., n~ that any such extension would be valueless without a similar extension of the main concession. I do not quite understand why this should be so, but if it is, it is clearly impossible, as you point out, to use this means of extending the main concession and a prolongation in the case of the additional area could not therefore be considered. However, in all the circumstances, and to maintain good relationships with the Sheikh, I hope that you will be successful in your efforts to obtain the agreement of the Company to a simple moratorium on exploratory work without invoking force majeure and without stioulating an extension of the period of the lease. We should be grateful if you could keen us fully posted as to what transpires as Petroleum Division are much concerned in these concessional questions. '^ours sincerely,VBJtfT LETTER. E.A. Berthoud, Esq.., Petroleum Division, Ministry of Fuel and Power. 5&gt;4DU 1942 Dear Berthoud, '.fill you please refer to pamgraphs 5 and 6 of the telegram from the ministry of Fuel and Power to New York No.79 FUEL of August the 15th last. This telegram transmitted a message from Ballaniy ne to Hanna, and the paragraphs in question dealt with a su gg estion by the latter tnat the Bahrain Petroleum Company should obtain from the Sheikh a moratorium releasing them, until one year after the end of the war, from the obligation to carry out commercial drilling operations in the additional area# 2# Ballantyne subsequently sent us a copy of the correspondence which had arisen out of these paragraphs, and asked for our advice. We thereupon consulted the Political Resident, summarising the cori'espondence in our telegram No# 19922 of November the 19th, a copy of which was sent' \ ‘X to you on rCoveniber the 23rd«- I now’ enclose a copy of the Political Residents reply* (The number and date of the Political Agent's letter mentioned in paragraph 2 of the enclosed telegram are almost certainly a mistake for No.C/35 of January 10th 1942; a copy of this letter was sent to the Petroleum Department on April the 29th under our No.Ext*f550/42. It stated that the Bahrain Government had no objection to the suspension of exploration work in the new area by- the Company.) 3. The two paragraphs under reference were drafted by Ballantyne after he had discussed Hanna's suggestion tvith our respective Departments at a meeting at which the War Office was also represented* According to our recollection you expressed the view, with which the War Office concurred, that exploratory drilling in wartime was/ / / No.t/ 764 of December 16th. •'iwas contrary to the policy of which could order oil companies under their control to suspend drilling of this kind. Even if this c were not the position, it would be true to say fi that the Company are prevented from completing t • # • their drilling programme by factors outside their control, viz. their inability to obtain the ■ vJ f &lt; &lt; - - „ — -h necessary equipment and staff (see in this 1 connection the letter from the Company's Chief local Representative to the Adviser to the Bahrein Government, No. CON -813 of Kay 18th 1941« a copy f of which was sent to the Petroleum Department on December 17 th 1941 under our No. Ext.8089/41)• In these circumstances it does not appear that the Political Resident is correct in assuming that the Company wish to discontinue drilling from considerations of their own convenience, and that ( for this reason it would be inappropriate to invoke * force majeure. 4* The Political Resident's statement that the military authorities have no authority in Bahrein so far may, strictly speaking, be true. But we assume that, since for purposes of defence 'f /BahreinBahrein, like the other Gulf States, lies within the province of the Persia and Iraq. Command, and since the oil policy for the whole of the Persia!*. Gulf area is laid down by H.M.G., the military authorities could in case of necessity issue instructions to the Oil Companies, either through the political authorities or, in emergency, direct. In the present case, if it were considered desirable to order the Company to suspend drilling, there seems no reason why the order should not be comnunicated to the Company through the Political Agent, as has been done in the case of relating to the oil denial scheme. 5* spite of these apparent flaws in the Political Residents argument, we consider that, subject to your concurrence, we might inform the Company that we agree with his view that nothing more is required than a moratorium in respect of Article 5 (presumably without any extension of the period of the lease). If the ^ftolitical authorities are rightin the course of the PEH. in thinking that for the Company to invoke force majeure would lead to difficulties with the Shaikh, and if the Company's requirements can be satisfactorj^met without recourse to this expedient, there seems good ground for advising ■them to adopt the alternative suggested by the Political Resident. We would ^ of course represent to them that it is to their interest no less than ours to avoid causing annoyance to the Shaikh. We doubt whether there is much in the objection that the Political Resident's alternative would not involve an extension of the duration of the Concession; since it seems reasonable to expect that the time which the Company will lose will be only a small fraction of the 55 years for which the Concession was granted. 6. We should be glad if you would let us know whether you agree to our discussing the matter with Ballantyne on the lines suggested in the preceding paragraph.

Additional area# 2* I agree with line' attributed to Political Agent in your paragraph No.2 and would have preferred being consulted before any reply was given to Ballantine. The position is that Company for their own convenience do not wish to proceed with drilling and I feel it would be straining definition of term 'force majeure' to invoke it now, especially since this automatically entails extension of whole Concession for indefinite period. All that Company need is a moratorium in respect of Article 5 and If they require anything . further than that contained in Political Agent ? s letter C/33 of January 10th 1940 r it should be easy to arrange. Military authorities have of Courage no authority in Bahrain so far. 3. Andersbn came to see me this morning and I told him I shared Political Agent’s views* He suggested that Company might ask for extension of duration of concession In respect of additional area to cover time now lost and that as this extension without similar extension, of main concession that extended accordingly. I replied that it would he explain to Sheikh that main concession would have because Company had failed to drill in area where nothing. He did not press the point. would 'be valueless should also be difficult to to be extended they had found 4. As Company consider results in additional area have so far been negative It appears to me that they are in any case covered by sub-paragraph (b) of Article Ho-5* (ue and)Anderson told both Wakefield and myself that he has no idea ivhat Company have in mind but that his personal assistant Ben Grow who left for New York on December 10th would explain local view point and obtain clarification of policy. hruUh te.

He states further that if any doubt is felt about stopping voluntarily military or other paramount local authority will if approached give you written orders to suspend operations. If you agree suggest you proceed on basis of advising Bahrein Government that drilling in exploratory area will be suspended in accordance with article 8 forwarding copies of orders to this office for safekeeping.

'Have had preliminary discussion with authority on this subject and he states he would deplore action suggested by you and intimated he would advise Sheikh against accepting^ , He believes this would be bad move from psychological viewpoint and would arouse Sheikh's suspicion that he night stand to lose minimum royalty, such suspicion would of course be absurd but despite my assurance local authority persisted in his viewpoint. Main objection seems to be that force majeure is an ugly word and Sheikh would not like it. He does not recommend adoption of alternative suggestion your 970 .since technically military have no authority in this regard until they actually take over control of Government. Understand tiiat this alternative was adopted by nearby concession and local Sheikh very reluctant to recognise authority of military to issue such orders. Local authority suggests the following course of action which he is confident would be acceptable, namely that company request release from obligations under article 5 of Deed dated June 19th, 19L0 due to present existing circumstances. Use of the word force majeure and mention of article 8 to beowolded.

India Office state that according to local political authorities curtailment of production from Bahrein field is causing unrest among local staff and may lead to political difficulties with Bahrein Government. On an assured production of 30,000 barrels daily consider that Sheikh would not be content with 3. India Office n production of less than 18.000 barrels a day. Please let me know as soon as possible whether you agree Bahrein Government may be informed that Company will do their best to maintain production at this level. I advise ycm give most earnest consideration to acceptance this position. I have been unable consider effect upon mainland since I know nothing of your recent discussions this respect nor of needs of Saudiarab Government but on present or recent rate of production of 15,000 daily for Bahrein and 5.000 daily for Mainland the K ortion of 18,000 and 12,000 respectively of assured uction now apparently agreed upon appears to be not ' o Mainland. unfair 4. Also advise you send message in general terms to local management in order to counteract any feeling there may be among staff that they are being forced to remain at Bahrein when there- is no work for them.

Tt c 7W) 8083 1941 Sec ir-^T v^U.eK bc.xje t^Oim Dear Sir, Owing to the international situation and the resultant shortage of man-power, we are finding it impossible to maintain the rapid pace which we have kept during the last two years on exploratory work in the Additional Area. We write this letter to explain our position and to ask your consideration of our problem. It may be of interest to you if we outline here the work which already has been accomplished in the exploration of the Additional Area: 1 . A complete triangulation survey was made. 2. A map of the entire area was prepared. 3. A surface geological survey was made. 4 . A costly geophysical survey was made by reflection seismograph. 5 . Eleven structure holes were drilled in the sea, on smaller islands and on the littoral of the main island, and another bore is being started. 6 . A complete geological study has been made of all available data. The entire job has now reached the stage where we have some conception of the structural relationships in the Area, and we are of the opinion that a few more structure holes drilled at various points will probably complete the picture. (In this connection we again request permission to drill at Saafa since it is a location whichwhich could be drilled from a stone pier, and would furnish a great amount of information.) Most of the structure locations which can be drilled with little white labour have been drilled, and the remaining places which we would drill were conditions normal are in deeper water. The deeper water locations necessitate the construction of steel piers which in turn require the use of pile-driver and A-frame barges, mechanics, welders, and other skilled staff which we are short ox in our routine producing and refining operations. v 7e have been unable to get any men skilled in these trades from .England for many months, and at present we are unable to attract Americans. We wish hereby to advise you and the Bahrain Government of the situation, and to inform you that s tructure we are pursuing and will continue to pursue/drilling to the best of our ability and to the limits justified by results obtained. We should appreciate your written recognition and approval of this program. Yours very truly, Sd. B.A. Kennedy.

Political Agent, Bahrain.i 4542 Copy of letter No. CON-816 dated the 22nd May 1941 from the Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, Bahrain, to the Political Agent, Bahrain. In the pre-emption clause, Paragraph 9, of the Political Agreement, His Majesty's Government has, briefly in effect, the right to preempt all crude oil gotten under the Concession, to require the Company to refine oil fuel to Admiralty specifications, or to take over operations. Under certain possible international developments the Government might exercise their prerogative under these clauses. Naturally we would wish to cooperate if this step is taken and to expedite operations of such a plan. Doubtless it is unnecessary to explain to you that this move would necessitate some drastic changes in refinery operation, as well as disruptions in the delivery of pro ducts to various parts of the Stopire. Therefore in the event that Government should make such an important deci sion, we should like to have a suitable period of notice in which to effect the change-over. In this connection will you inform us as to the procedure that would be followed, and what Government authority is competent to exercise the preemption clauses. Inasmuch as the local General Manager does not have the authority to consent to such matters on behalf of the Company, we should like to be assured that preemption would only come through formal written political channels, so that he can submit the preemption orders to his directors. Copy of letter No. CON-817 dated the 22nd May 1941 from the Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, Bahrain, to the Political Agent, Bahrain. In another letter wtitten to you today v/e have asked on whose authority we should act in fulfilment of the preemption clauses. In this letter we should like to enquire by whose authority acting through what channels might the refining or producing installations be rendered less useful to the enemy. It appears possible that under some exigency of the moment a military officer might order that the Company's property be damaged or destroyed. We should like to know whether the military would be the proper authority in such a case, or whether only a written order signed by the Political Agent and/or the Political Residcnt^should be recognised.DRAFT E XT 4542 1941 To The Chief Local Hapreaentntive, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, B H T? A I N Dear Sir, Please refer to your letters No. CON-816 and CON- 817 dated the 82nd May 1941. 2. It may safely be assumed that should His Majesty's Government decide to enforce the pre-emption clause of the Political Agreement, the Company's Head Office in London vpossibly Mr. Ballantyne) would be informed by India Office, and at the same time the political authority in Bahrain viz. the Political A^ent would communicate with the Local Manager of the Conpany. The Political Ageno will be the sole authority to give any instructions lie the Company, and even in the event of a military con trol beijv; established in Bahrain, such an authority »i.xx have to act in close consonance with the Political Agent. Should any change of authority become imminent, the Company would certainly receive prior information.

Also, you mey take it that as the Admiralty desire that payment for oil should be made in London, the Conpany are willing to waive their request for payment in Bahrain. This means that the documents as you have approved then, are agreed to by the Company. Subject, therefore, to any further steps to be taken by His Majesty’s Government and to Mr. Thornburg's author ity to sign for the Company the Deed of Further Modification of the Lease, there should be no delay in completing this matter. You have kindly suggested that with a view to expediting the matter I might be authorised by the Company to sign the Political Agreement on their behalf subject to con firmation by the sealing of the document in two parts by the Company. Such sealing would, of course, have to take place in New York or somewhere else in the United States of America. I have asked, by telegraph, for instructions oa this latter question; I think it quite likely that your suggest ion will be agreed to. R&amp;Qo. POL.

Sir, With reference to your semi-official letter of the 8th April last, No. P.Z.1888/40, con cerning the proposed political agreement with the Bahrein Petroleum Company, I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that they understand that the Emergency Powers (Persian Gulf States) Order in Council made under Section 4 of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, extends the application of that Act to Bahrein to the extent of Bis Majesty* s jurisdiction there and empowers the Political Resident to make Defence Regulations under the Act, and that under the Bahrein Order in Council, His Majesty has jurisdiction in Bahrein in relation to the persons and property of British subjects and of foreigners with respect to whom the Sheikh has agreed that His Majesty should exercise jurisdiction. Also that the Sheikh has in fact agreed to His Majesty*s exercising jurisdiction with respect to all foreigners. In these circumstances My Lords concur in the proposals in the above-quoted India Office letter. As regards semi-official letter of the 26th March last, on the same subject, I am to acquaint you that My Lords see no objection, in principle, to inclusion in the schedule of the political agreement of an additional sub-paragraph to the effect that ’’unless otherwise agreed upon, payments shall be made to the Company at Bahrein within 60 days after delivery’*. (This period is inserted in preference to 30 days as the Company is prepared to agree to it). Having regard, however, to the arrangements laid down for fixing the price laid down in paragraph l(iv), some little time might well elapse before a final price could be agreed, and in these circumstances My Lords consider that the additional sub-paragraph should provide for a provisional price for the purpose of payment in the interim. Payment for Admiralty bulk fuel oil contracts placed f.o.b* Abadan, Trinidad, etc. is made to the respective Oil Companies in London. The Bahrein Petroleum Company have a London Office, and payment to that office v/ould probably be much more convenient than for an Admiralty account Vo be opened at Bahrein. However, if S desired by the Company, arrangements could be made for payment to be made by the Divisional Accountant Officer at Bahrein who has an official banking account.

As regards Jarrett*s comments in his M.03201/40 of 20th March, I agree with the suggestion in the penultimate paragraph, which I understand you have already adopted, and in view of what he says in the previous paragraph, I suggest that, when drafting the final edition of the political agreement, it should be made quite clear that the undertaking to be given by the Sheik will subject oil production under both the original concession on Bahrein Island and the new concession over the Unallotted Area to the proposed qualified form of pre-emption. With regard to Gibson ! s letter to Jarrett (PZ 1684/40) of 26th March, I confirm my telephone conversation of yesterday in which I said that this seemed to be a matter that concerned the Admiralty primarily, and that if they accepted it we had no comments to make.

I have to infom you, in reply, as ibllows:- (a) The draft of the Deed of Further Modification of the Lease dated 29th December 1934, as amended by you, is satisfactory to my Company. There are one or two verbal corrections to be made for engrossing purposes: these I have shewn in red ink on the draft accompanying your letter to me, aid which draft is enclosed herewith. YJould you be good enough to return this draft to me at your convenience. (b) To answer the question in sub-clause (iii) of clause 2 of your letter, I would say that the provisions of Articles XII, XVIII, XIX and XXII of the 1934 Lease, will, by virtue of the new Deed of Modification, be extended to the un allotted area. On the other hand, the political provisions in the present Lease remain in the Lease, althoigh they v/ill be superseded by the new Political Agreement. These previsions COPY SENT TO Scan be left out of the comprehensive Concession which, as you rightly believe, the Company intend subsequently to negotiate to cover in one document all their rights in the Sheikh’s terri tory. (c) The Company also instruct me to s ay that the form of the Political .Agreement accompanying your letter under reply, is also one which they are pleased to be able to accept with the two slight exceptions which were mentioned to Mr. Gibson at the talk Mr. Max Thornburg and I had with-him this afternoon. These exceptions are:- (i) The provision to be made for the p^rnentfor oil or oil products as they are delivered frcn time to time or v/ithin a specified period of delivery, and (ii) That the place of payment be Bahrain. I have modified in red ink, one of the drafts you kindly sent to me for my use, and return it to you so that you may see the wording of the alterations we asked for. I mey add that although it is considered to be important that liie place of payment should be designated, if possible, it is imperative that the provision as to payment should be made. From their experience in these matters, the Company see no reason why a fair price should not be readily ascertainable for oil ani oil prod ucts taken over by 11.LI.Government, and also why those prices shouldHIS HIGHNESS SHAIKH SIR HAMAD BIN SHAIKH 'ISA AL KEALIPAH, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., SHilIKH OP BAHREIN - and - THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED.

A copy of our letter to &amp;r. B&amp;liantyne is being sent to you separately. 2. I discussed the agreements today with kr. Baliantyne and l.r. Thornburg, one of the American directors, and find that, except for oue point, they are prepared to accept our amendments of the commerciai concession and also the draft of the political agreement now cflered to them. The exception relates to the schedule to the political agreement. The Company are very anxious to ensure that they will not be kept waiting an unreasonable time for payment for oil etc. taken over by or on behalf of His Majesty's Government. Consequently they wish to insert, as a new sub-paragraph of paragraph 1(iv) of the schedule, the following - 'Unless otherwise agreed upon, payments shall be made to the Company at Bahrein within 30 (or, if His Majesty's Government press for it, within 60 / days after delivery'. 5 . It was obvious that the Company attached much importance to this stipulation of a period within which payment is to be made, and prinaa facie it seems reasonable m principle. ould you kindly let us know as soon as possible whether you coticur in the amendmentr 4.

MILITARY BRANCH, ! ^ ' iwn ■—r~r ADMIRALTY, 3.W.I. 20th March, 1940# CONFIDENTIAL. Dear Peel, In reply to your letter of the 14th February last P.Z.620/40, concerning the Bahrein unallotted area agreements, I write to say that we were very reluctant to abandon the pre-emption clause in its original form because an agreement of this nature direct with the company has, we think, considerable advantages over an agreement in which our power to take action is dependent on our relations with or an agreement by the Sheikh himself* The absence of the pre-emption clause in the original Bahrein concession was a matter of considerable concern to the Admiralty, though at a later stage it was accepted that we should, in fact, in the case of Bahrein, where our grip is much tighter than with the other Sheikhs in this area, be able to act through the Sheikh to get what we wanted in time of war. As a result, however, of this anxiety, great care was taken to get the pre-emption clause inserted in the other concessions in the area. If we now make a new agreement without the simple pre-emption clause, this may be a precedent to other agreements in areas where our status with the local Sheikh is not so firm. However, we understand that the effect of the agreement now proposed, coupled with the undertaking to be given by the Sheikh, is to subject production under both the old concession and the new to a qualified R,T.

Assuming that this is a fact, we agree that the arrangement now suggested should he accepted ii it is quite clear that the company will not accept the ordinary pre-emption clause. quite possible that H.M.

If, in the event of national emergency or war, the Sheikh, on the advice and on 'behalf of Hie Majesty’s Government, should render the normal commercial operations of the company impossible 'by taking any such action as that described in the schedule hereto, the company will co-operate with the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government in the production and delivery of oil to the order of His Majesty’s Government in the manner and on the terms and conditions in the said schedule set forth.4 6*9 n fu rfl**44* / &lt; - t L AUUA u/ifkoj '“ / rj^D SCHEDULE■ #&lt; a**y *(. flue (1) In the event of all/crude oil cotton under the Concession * ar Any rj‘ 4^- granted 'by the Sheikh to the Company and all/the products thereof 'being taken over 'by the Sheikh on 'behalf of His Majesty’s Government, (i) The Company will, to the extent of any refining capacity it may have in Bahrein produce oil fuel that shall comply with the Admiralty specifications at the time, provided that Bahrein oil 'be of a suitable kind and quality for this purpose. (ii) The Company will use its utmost endeavours to increase so far as reasonably possible with existing facilities the supply of oil and/or products thereof for the Government to the extent required by the Government. (iii) The Company will with every reasonable expedition and so as to avoid demurrage on the vessel or vessels engaged to convey the same, do its utmost to deliver all oil or products of oil taken over as aforesaid in the quantities at the time and in the manner required by the Government at a convenient place of shipment or at a place of storage in Bahrein to be determined by His Majesty’s Government. In the event of a vessel employed to carry any such oil or products thereof on behalf of His Majesty being detained on demurrage at the port of loading the Company will pay the amount due for demurrage according to the terms of the charter party and/or the rates of loading previously agreed with the Company unless the delay is due to causes beyond the control of the Company. Any dispute which may arise as to whether the delay is due to causes beyond the control of the Company shall be settled by agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company, and, in default of such agreement, the question shall be referred to two arbitrators, one to be chosen by His Majesty’s Government (or tne Political Resident) and the other by the company, with power to appoint an umpire in case of disagreementc such//)- /] SO. V. Mr. Walton. V Bahrein Unallotted Area, Please see Mr. Gibson’s note below. You will remember that Mr. Ballantyne’s objection to the proposed pre-emption provisions in the Political Agreement was that they might upset their marketing arrangements as being a new engagement entered into by the Company with H. M.G. subsequent to their sales contract already in existence. The view of the Foreign Office, stated in their letter of the 26th August, is that they do not consider the point about the pre-emption clause as of much importance since in the event of an emergency we should do whatever was necessary and the Company would have to accept is as force ma.ieure . The Petroleum Department in their letter of the 11th January suggest a way out of the difficulty. Instead of asking the Company to agree to the right of pre-emption we should merely ask them to agree that in the event of steps being taken by H.M.G. in a national emergency or war to take over the oil production in Bahrein the terms of the Schedule shall then apply. In other words, if force ma.ieure is brought to bear on the Company arrangements are cut and dried for the necessary transactions between the Company and H.M.G. This seems to give us what we want while not making the Company give away the right of pre-emption. The Political Resident suggested something on these lines in his Express Letter of the 10th July, No. 627 S. The Legal Adviser has suggested a revision of Article IX of the Political Agreement and consequential amendments in the Schedule in the above sense. In order however to make the matter quite watertight we must I think have some written/written understanding with the Sheikh that in the event of an emergency or war he will at our request and on our behalf take over the oil. This might best be effected by an exchange of letters with the Sheikh when we convey the approval of H.M.G. to the Commercial Agreement. I do not imagine that he will make any difficulty about this. If you concur in this suggestion we will endeavour to secure the agreement of the Admiralty who at present desire to press the Company to agree to pre-emption (see their letter of the 31st January.) As soon as this point is cleared up between us we shall be ready to take the matter to its final stages with Mr. Ballantyne. The Political Resident is pressing for an early decision.DMG fNDfA OFFfCE \MD Any further communi should be addressed to:— The Secretary of the Admiralty, London, S.W.l.

W, 1 . 19 ^-G January., 19 4Q I am commanded hy My Lords Ccmmissloners of the Admiralty to state for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that they are now in a position to reply to two semi-official letters of the 30th May, 1939 P.Z.2067/39 and a further letter of the 5 th July 1939, No.P.Z.4023/39 concerning the Bahrein Petroleum Company's concession for the unallotted area, consideration of which was interrupted by the outbreak of war. As regards the first letter of the 30th May, covering a preliminary draft of the Company’s concession agreement. My Lords have now no remarks to offer either on the description of the Sheikh’s territory which has been accepted without comment by that Ruler, or on the compulsory processing of a minimum quantity of Bahrein oil which has since been agreed to and stands as Article 9 of the revised Commercial Agreement. As regards the second letter of the 30th May dealing with the political agreement between His Majesty’s G-overnnent and the Company, which follows in its general lines the political agreements in other neighbouring territories, My Lords concur in the addition to clause 8 to provide for the use by His Majesty’s Government of harbours and harbour facilities developed by the Company, and as regards clause 5 (channels of communication between the Company suid the Bahrein Government) are prepared to agree to any arrangements that meet local convenience and permit of adequate British control. They also concur in the proposal that Article 11 should provide only for the termination of the concession agreement by the Sheikh for any breach of the political agreement and should not provide for confiscation of property. The Under-Secretary of State, India Office, S.W.l. /As ...... RZCo. POL. OEPt. - riti- 2 - As regards the question of the sea area of the Bahrein State, My Lords agree with the Foreign Office view that - (1) Sovereignty extends over all waters within three nautical miles from low water mark of any of the Bahrein islands, unless land belonging to any other power lies within six miles, in which case the boundary of territorial waters divides the distance equally# (2) Company’s derricks erected in shallow water would not constitute a new island from which a new area of three miles v/idth could be claimed as territorial waters. (3) The area of the Gulf, outside the territorial waters of Qatar and Saudi Arabia cannot be claimed as Bahrein territorial waters. (4) The bed of the sea and the land under it is hov/ever capable of acquisition by occupation beyond the three mile limit. Subject in (4) hov/ever, to the addition that such acquisition by occupation must not affect the use by all countries of the v/aters over such portions of the bed of the sea or the land under it. As regards the pre-emption clause in the agreement My Lords are not convinced that adequate grounds exist for its cancellation althought is correct that His Majesty’s Government would act as necessary in an emergency and the Company whatever its nationality would have to accept the action as force majeure . There are advantages in possessing the Company’s prior agreement to the course of action to be pursued in emergency or war, especially as regards co-operation in increased production refining to a suitable specification and price fixing, and to meet any possible reluctance on the part of the Rheikh to co-operate with the British Government. There is probably some force in the firm’s argument that the full disclosure of pre-emption obligations to their customers might make the latter a little hesitant before entering into contract commitments. But if a pre-emption by the Government, which would be exercised none the less without a pre-emption clause, is force majeure none the less because a pre-emption clause is included. My Lords fail to see why /the.-3- the Bahrein Petroleum Company should take up the attitude that they are in faith bound to disclose the pre-emption obligation in its entirety, A ''force majeure' clause permitting the sellex* to terminate or modify his obligations, is a common feature in contracts and the wording is usually so comprehensive that it would be unlikely to raise any special doubts in the minds of the purchasers. Having regard to the course of these negotiations, see especially Admiralty letter M.01463/39 of the 31st March 1939, and to the fact that Eis Majesty’s Government have not stood in the way of the Bahrein Petroleum Company obtaining the concession in spite of certain unsatisfactory features of their negotiations, My Lords consider that the Company should be pressed to agree to the pre-emption clause and to find some other way. out of their contract difficulties. My Lords would be glad to be informed in due course of the outcome of the Company’s objection to clause 3 concerning transfer of obligations and benefits to another Company.

DEPt. 1 ?JAM 940 INDIA OFFICEPolitical Agreement dated 26th June and in your Department’s note of provisional comments. We see (Gibson's note of 26th June) that Ballantyne is apparently not going to press his ^'objection to Article 7 . On the question of pre-emption, see (e) below. (d) As to Ballantyne's comments on Article 3 of the Political Agreement (see Gibson's note of 26th June), we note that, as indicated in your note of provisional comments, the words 'obligations and benefits' in this draft article, to which Ballantyne particularly objects, were taken from the Koweit Political Agreement and do not appear for instance, in the Debai and Sharjah Political Agreements. For our part we should agree to the deletion of these words, if this satisfies Ballantyne. But we do think that it would be desirable to insert something on the lines of the further sentence in your note of provisional comments (i.e. 'It is understood..... His Majesty's Government'). (e) As regards the difficult question of pre-emption ( Article 10 and Schedule ) the particular point which the Company are making, namely, possible upsetting of their marketing arrangements following on disclosure of their pre-emption obligations, has certainly never been raised before. Ballantyne admits, however, that his Company's contracts duly3 make provision for '‘force majeure'; the 'pre-emption clause' is really only designed to provide for the procedure and to afford a measure of price control in the event of a particular type of 'force majeure' being exercised. In these circumstances, it might perhaps meet Ballantyne’s difficulty if the Company, instead of being asked to agree that His Majesty’s Government shall have the right of pre-emption, are merely asked to agree that, in the event of steps being taken by His Majesty’s Government in national emergency or war to take over the oil production in Bahrein, the terms of the Schedule shall then apply to any transactions between them and His Majesty’s Government. Something of this kind must in fact already be in operation 3 As regards the Concession Agreement (a) We have examined the draft, both as amended by your Department and in the most recent version which has been largely agreed with the Sheikh. (b) We agree with the present formula for the description of the area, namely the 'Sheikh’s present and future dominions'. (c) Subject to (e) and (f) below, we have no observations on Powle’s and Weightman’s comments (see PZ.4124/39). (d) As regards Article 4 it is customary in Oil Concessions to give the concessionaire the exclusive right to- prospect for and win petroleum but the non-exclusive right to sell and transport petroleum. As the Article is worded at present it gives the Company, under 4(a), the exclusive right ^inter alia) to transport petroleum, qualified by the proviso under 4(c), which says that the rights granted by either sub-clauses (a) or (b) of the Article shall not include the exclusive right to sell petroleum products within the Sheikh’s present and future dominions. This has probably originated from Article I of the lease dated 29th December, 1934, the terms of which appear to be somewhat inconsistent especially as regards the operation of refineries. Ve therefore think that in order to make it quite clear that the Company shall not have a complete monopoly of marketing oil within the Sheikh’s present and future dominions (which would, we think, be implicit in an exclusive right to transport ) it would be advisable to suggest the insertion of the words ”or transport' between the words 'sell' and 'within' in Article 4(c) of the draft Agreement. This would follow the procedure adopted in Article 3 of the Debai Commercial Agreement. Consequential alterations would be necessary in wVuj u»(b) ? Sub-Clauses (a) and (b). (e) In view of the explanation regarding Article 5 in Weightman’s letter (including the enclosed letter of 6th February from Mr. Davies), we can hardly attempt to insist on an obligation to maintain in operation a fixed number of 'stringsof tools”. (f) As regards Weightman’s comments on Article 9 , we agree that it would he desirable to insert the words 'royalty paying” where he suggests. (g) We note that Articles XII, XVIII, XIX and XXII of the original Bahrein lease of 29th December, 1934, are omitted from the new draft. We feel that provisions of this kind ought to apply to the unallotted area. But possibly the intention is to cover these points in connection with the consolidated concession covering all the Company’s rights and obligations in Bahrein, which you say may be negotiated at a later date. (h) In your first amended version of the draft you included, as Article 11 , the clause regarding pollution of coastal waters which Starling suggested in the penultimate paragraph of his letter P.D.29/1 of 27th May, 1938. This has now been deleted, but I hope it will be re-incorporated in the next draft. 4. I am sending copies of this letter to Jarrett and Eyres.

Mr. Ballantyne duly rang me up,in pursuance of the attached letter, and I told him that so far as I could see the unallotted area concession was so near completion that there should be no objection to his company carrying out exploratory work, especially if the Sheikh himself was pressing it. I understand however that we might have to consult the Petroleum Department, for instance, and also the authorities on the spot. He quite recognises this, but he was in touch with Mr. Thornburg in America who was anxious to know whether he could go ahead with selecting personnel for exploration. If there was likely to be opposition to the idea he would not of course do so. I told him that I thought Mr. Thornberg could certainly go ahead provisionally. If the Petroleum Department see no objection I suggest that we might now consult with the Resident and Weightman on the point. / ^ ^ o*-*&lt; ^ U ^ cf tz (wU ' J LAI understand that this Company now desire to have permission to proceed with geophysical and other preliminary field work in Bahrain because the time is rapidly approaching when the Company must arrange the parties who are to go to Bahrain to undertake this work: the local' 'n 2 rn 30 z O vJ o 2 r~ CO m O CxJ co cz — O cr&gt; 30 z 30 m 0 m H &gt; &gt;- 30 k z o -c CJ1 *n ~0 to 30 *n o m r~ XI 2 O —i &gt;- o CD OJ f— &gt; r” CO r~ m o H m H -o m —! 30 ity makes it desirable that the work, if it is to be done at all this coming year, should be commenced as early in the Autumn as possible. The Sheikh of Bahrain has been rather insistent that the Company should proceed with exploration work and also do some test drilling with out losing time, and he has received assurances in that connection. Of course, anything which the Conpany might do prior to the sign ing and delivering of the two Agreements, that is the Political Agreement and the Supplemental Lease, would be at the risk of the Bahrein Petroleum Company in all things; furthermore, it would be distinctly understood by the Bahrein Petroleum Company that permission to proceed before the docu ments were concluded would not hamper either the British Government or the Government of Bahrain in the proceedings now on foot between those Govern ments and the Company - in other words, the two documents would proceed to a conclusion in the normal fashion according to the arrangements ultim-ately come to between the British Government and the Bahrein Petroleum Gonpany without regard to the fact that the Bahrein Petroleum Company were engaged in this preliminaiy work.

I do not think we have any comments to make on the new draft concession. As regards the political agreement, we accept the views expressed in your comments on Mr. Ballantyne*s notes. I personally do not feel H that the point about the pre-emption clause is of outstanding importance. As the Company themselves seem to recognise, we should, in the event of an emergency, presumably do v/hatever we thought necessary, and the Company, whatever its nationality, would have to accept our action as force majeure. 3. As regards Mr. Ballantyne's suggestion about the area of the concession, we feel that he is probably /confusing R.T.Peel , Esq. , C*B*iii*&gt; RECd. POL DEPt. ENCLOSURE IN AIR MAIL LETTER No. 36 - 5 ST1939 FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL DEPT. f 27AUG1939 INDIA OFFICE7^ , , ,, | E20G | confusing (1) the question of the extent of territorial waters with (2) the question of the acquisition of'rights over the sea-bed outside territorial waters* 4. Mr. Ballantyne is quite right in saying that the Sheikh of Bahrein has sovereignty over all waters within 3 nautical miles from low-water mark of any islands over which he can properly claim sovereignty, unless, of course, land belonging to any other power lies v/ithin 6 miles of a Bahrein island, in which case the boundary of territorial waters should divide the distance equally. We do not, however, think that the further proposition could be sustained that, if the Company were to erect derricks in shallow waters, these derricks would each constitute a new island, so to speak, from which a new area of 3 miles could be claimed as Bahrein territorial v/aters. Such claims have been put forward unsuccessfully in the past for light-houses and anchored light-ships. u. Nor can we accept Mr. Ballantyne*s further contention that the whole of the area of the gulf outside the territorial waters of Qatar and Saudi Arabia could be claimed for Bahrein. This gulf is not bounded /byrule about landlocked bays surrounded by the territories of a single State would not therefore apply here even if the gulf were indeed such a bay which seems doubtful. 7. The position with regard to the acquisition of rights over the sea-bed was, as you will remember, set out in Beckett*s minute of the 22nd April 1938, a copy of which was sent to Gibson under cover of Brenan*s letter E 2288/413/91 of the 25th April. It is recognised by His Majesty*s Government that the bed of the sea and the land under it is capable of acquisition by occupation beyond the 3-mile limit. The Company w r ould therefore be able to appropriate the sea-bed outside territorial waters by effective occupation, and, as and when they did so, the sovereignty would presumably vest in the Sheikh of Bahrein though it might be advisable for the Bahrein Government to make some further overt act claiming such sovereignty.

This possesses the advantage that His Majesty 1 8 Government can receivej in the initial stages of any such discussion, a report based on local knowledge (c.f« comments under Article 8 below). I suggest therefore that the Article be redrafted to allow communication in Bahrain.' Since the Headquarters of the Company are not in England this Article as worded is necessary but it does not prevent questions being initiated at Bahrain. I am not of opinion that any amendment is necessary. Article 3. No comment. Article 4. No comment. Article 5. Political Agent, Bahrain, writes. ”In point of fact a great deal of routine and unimportant work is already disposed of in direct communication between the Company and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. I see no need for any special reservations to be made in this Article. The Political .Agent knows everything that goes on, and if he were to find that too liberal an interpretation were taken of the words 'routine or unimportant matters' it would be his business to step in and rectify matters.” If this reservation were not inserted all business between the Company and the Bahrain Government would have to be conducted through the Political Agent, which would give the latter unnecessary work and lead to delays. Since, as the Political Agent points out, routine work is already disposed of in direct communication between-3- between the Company and the Bahrain Government the reservation merely regularises the position and I am of opinion that it should be retained# Article 6# This repeats Article XVII of the 1936 Mining Lease* It would be preferable to have the stronger wording of Article 3 of the Kuwait Politicdl Agreement though it might be difficult to secure this with a wholly American Company. Article 7. No comment. Article 8. Political Agent writes; 'The addition to the normal form of this Article it presumably due to an (inaccurate) suggestion by Mr.Ballantyne that His Majesty's Ships use the Company's harbours free of charge. In point of fact the Company has no harbour approachable by any but shallow draft boats and barges. The addition therefore bestows no benefit.' Whether the addition is made on the grounds suggested by the Political Agent or not, it is impossible to say what future developments may occur, and I think it. should be retained# Article 9# No comment# Article 10. Political Agent, Bahrain, writes: u In the course of examining the draft agreement, it has occurred to me that a major obstruction may arise owing to the existence of sales contracts already entered into by the Company for long periods ahead# (I have not, of course, made any attempt locally to ascertain what contracts they now have)• Such contracts might contain 'force majeure' clauses to cover non-performance owing to war,r 4- war, but such clauses could not| I imagine f be stretched legally to cover a subsequent agreement with His Majesty*s Government by which the latter may pre-empt in war-time. If this is so, it will become necessary to approach the problem from a totally different angle - in other words His Majesty*s Government must first acquire a legal right from the Ruler of Bahrain to take over (in effect) in war time all Bahrain products describable as 'war material**. I am not quite sure what the legal procedure would be, or whether a subsequent formal Political Agreement with the Company would be necessary.- Possibly only an understanding would be necessary - that His Majesty*s Government on their side would pay fair prices and/or compensation, and the Company on their side would work their concession and Refinery Agreement to capacity limits.** The points raised by the Political Agent would seem to be covered in paragraphs (4) and (5) of the Schedule to this clause, and in any case it seems to me that the Company will doubtless safeguard their interests in this matter.

Both parties contemplate that an all-embracing document of this kind shall be negotiated in due course (subject to the approval of His Majesty^ Government) but consider that this is a matter which can be taken up at leisure in the course of the next two or three years* With this view I am in entire agreement* (b) Article X This article may have some legal significance which is not apparent to me* To my mind it is unnecessary but never the* less unobjectionable* (c) Artielea 2 sad 3 Some considerable discussion has been held, and both parties have solicited my personal views, on the question of defining the area to which this Supplemental Deed shall apply* The object of both parties is to frame a lease for an area coincident with the existing and future possessions of the Shaikh of Bahrain, and the wording now used seems to provide the simplest means of achieving this object* It is to be recog* nlsed that in existing circumstances it is not possible to define either in words or by lines on a map the present dominions of the Shaikh of Bahrain* In the first place, though there can be no substantial doubt in regard to Bahrain’s rights in the Hawar group of islands, His Majesty’s Government have not yet been able to declare their final decision on the dispute existing between Bahrain and Tatar in respect of these islands* Secondly a dispute exists between Bahrain and the Saudi Government in regard to the two islands, Bain al Kabir and Bain as Saghir, onboth of which Bahrain Government marks exist at the moment* Thirdly no accurate survey has yet been made of the waters, shoals and reefs on the east, south and west of Bahrain main Island, while therefore it would not be impossible to define 'the present dominions', by reference to the names of Islands (excluding the Hswar group and the Bainain) and 'thair terri torial waters', no substantial advantage could accrue by so doing at the present stage* The wording now proposed provides for the elasticity necessary for the conduct of negotiations between Saudi Arabia and Bahrain both in respect of the substan tive dispute existing in regard to the Bainain and also for the definition of 'spheres” in the manner suggested by me separately in demi-official correspondence arising from that dispute* It provides also, by its reference to 'future dominions', for the extension of the Bahrain dominions by acquisition of the sea bed in shoal waters by effective occupation in the manner adumbrated in Foreign Office Minute of the 22nd April 1938, whidi fonaed one of the enclosures to India Office letter No* P*Z* 2904/38 dated the 29th April 1938 to your address* I have already indicated separately the likelihood of intensive explo ration of shoal waters in the next few years and it is clearly desirable that the present lease should be so drafted that the Bahrain State may not be deprived of the benefit of such explo ration conducted by its cllant, the Bahrain Petroleum Company* In short, since - as the result of last year* s negotiations - the Bahrain Government are in treaty with a single company for a lease covering the whole of the Bahrain dominions whatever they m«y be during the next 55 years, I suggest that the present definition le adequate* (d) Article 4 requires little comment* The wording of sub-paragraph (a) does, it is true, serve to extend the term of the original T'O&amp;se /--4- L««se *ince th« period of 55 yoars counting from the date of the new Deed relate* to the Company 1 a rights within the whole of the Shaikh's present and future dominions| hut since the normal lease period is 75 years 9 1 do not see that any objection need he taken on this score* It will he observed that in sub-paragraph (b) the non exclusive rights granted to the Company are nov to Include 'radio and other facilities and apparatus of all kinds ••••• • ••••#•• except that radio equipment may not be used to transmit messages beyond the limits of the concession. M Since the sister company in Arabia has a similar right it seems unreason able to refuse it in the Bahrain lease 9 and the prohibition on radio transmission beyond the limits of the concession serves to protect the interests of Cabls and tireless Limited* Sub-paragraph (d) again seems to ms to be totally un necessary but unobjectionable* (e) nmnj In this article it will be observed no provision is made for maintaining a fixed number of 'strings of tools' in operation either in the present concession or in the Additional Area. Such an obligation was definitely Included in the offer made in Mr* Davies' latter of the 12th January 1939 to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government) a copy of which formed item 2 of the correspondence forwarded with my Express letter No* C/51 dated the 19th January 1939* It appears however that shortly afterwards the Company withdrew this particular part of it* offer in s latter of the 6th February 1939 of which I now enclose a copy* By an oversight on the part both of the Company and of the Bahrain Government no copy of this letter was forwarded to me at that time and I have only now received this in response to an enquiry. I mention this point merely in elucidation, since I feel convinced that an obligation to maintain A5- maintain a fixed number of drills in operation can confer no substantial benefit on the Bahrain Government in ensuring that the Company pursues its operations in accordance with good oil field practice; and I have ascertained that the Bahrain Govern- ment do in fact appreciate this point* (f) Article* 6 and 7 provide for the revised minimum royalty figures as negotiated between the Company and the Bahrain Gov&lt;irnment f and require no cooraent* (g) Article 8 also follows the agreement provisionally reached between the parties in their recent negotiations* (h) Article 9 equally reproduces an item in the negotiations already held| but requires some comment* It appears that by local agreement between the Bahrain Government and the Company a considerable part of the gas produced during the refining pro cess, which is in fact used in the furnaces in the Refinery, is converted by mathematical formula into an equivalent amount of oil fUel which, in accordance with the original Lease and the subsequent Refinery Agreement, may be deducted from the royalty paying total of crude oil as 'oil required for the customary operations of the Company's installations'• This of course is a reasonable and economic arrangement to which no objection can be taken; but viewing it in relation to an article prescribing that one half of the oil processed in the Refinery up to a total refinery throughput of 20,000 (or 25,000) barrels daily shall be Bahrain crude, it may conceivably be held that it subjects that share to proportional deduction* On a rough calculation this would cause a deduction of 6 per cent, and it was certainly never Intended that the Bahrain share of the Refinery throughput should be subjected to any such Asuch reduction* So far at I am aware the working arrangement between the Government and the Company f to which I have referred abovef cannot legally be described as an essential part of the original Lease or the Refinery agreement and consequently the Company could not claim a legal right to a deduction on this score* If this view is correct then I see no need to vary the wordii^ of Article 9* If however a reasonable doubt exists then I suggest that that doubt might be resolved by inserting the words 'royalty paying' before the word 'oil' in line 12 of the English part of this article* There is little doubt that such an insertion would be accepted by the Company 9 though in return they might propose a second variation in the article by which, in place of the existing stipulation) it would be provided that not less than one half of the amount of oil processed in the Refinery* up to a total of 20 f 000 (or 25 9 000) barrels daily, shall be produced in the Shaikh's preseat and future dominions* The effect of this would be that while the Shaikh's royalty rights under the article would be preserved) the Company would be enabled to vary the proportions of Saudi and Bahrain oil being processed in the Refinery as might suit them best seasonally* It haa 9 for example 9 been explained to me that the Arabian crude produces twice as much first grade kerosene as does the Bahrain crude and almost twice the quantity of diesel oil 9 while on the other hand the Bahrain crude pro duces a greater proportion of petrol* In view of the heavy seasonal demands of certain Eastern countries for kerosene the Company might at times wish 9 by increasing the Arabian pro portion of the throughput, to accumulate greater kerosene stocks than they could do economically if tied to a fixed dally pro portion of Bahrain oil passing through the Refinery; at such times the major part of Bahrain production would be exported in the form of crude* At other times the process might be reversed /-i/rJz -7- reversed whtn petrol stocks required to be built up* Any rights conferred on Hie Majesty's Government by a pre-emption schedule in a separate Political Agreement would not of course be affected| nor need it be apprehended that such a proposal would indicate an intention on the part of the Company to reduce Bahrain production to the minima negotiated, since in a letter of the 6th June 1939 Mr* Thornburg, on behalf of the Com; any, repeats the assurance given last January that while the Company cannot actually guarantee more than the minima negotiated it lias every expectation of being able to maintain Bahrain production at a figure approximating to I&gt;resent production* I enclose a copy of tnis letter herewith* 1 trust that this explanation la sufficiently clear for appreciation of the points involved* (1) . j-Ucla 10 requires no comment and is unobjectionable* 3d/- H.

Belgrave, Esq., Adviser to the Bahrain Government f Manama, Bahrain. Dear Sir, As one of the terms of my Company 1 s offer for the Unallotted Area, my letter of January 12, 1939 contains the following paragraph i 'During the period of one year following the date such Concession is granted, my Company will maintain at least 4 strings of tools in continuous operation within the area covered by the present Lease•' Commencing with the discovery of oil at Bahrain my Company has continuously exceeded the drilling obligations under its present Mining Lease- During the past year or longer it has maintained four to five strings of tools in operation* Ag a result there are now enough producing wells completed that the obligation to continue such a rapid development program over the next year would serve no useful purpose and could have no effect on the amount of oil to be produced here. On the other hand, a slower development pro gram will put my Company in a better position to space the ‘wells properly for greater ultimate recovery and to utilize more efficiently the experience gained in drilling. Because a more normal program will not affect Bahrain* s revenue, and will be helpful to my Company in its operations, the Company now wishes to modify its offer of January 12, 1939 to the extent of eliminating the obligation quoted above. Will you kindly inform His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain of this modification* Yours faithfully, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited Sd/- F* A. Davies.

Modify original Clause 2 to accord with the practice of the Company communicating with H.M.Government at Home and Abroad (abroad through the Political Agent and other Representatives) and thus avoid a technical default by failing to communicate through a British Subject in charge of the office in Great Britain. Original Claise 3. The import of this is not understood: could it be explained? Original Clause 4. No objection. Original Clause 5. It is suggested that this might be improved by altering it to read as follows:- ’’The Company in all except unimportant or routine matters shall deal with the Bahrain Government through a Chief Local Representative in Bahrain who shall be aBritish Subject and v/ho shall be the recognised channel of communication between the Company and the Bahrain Government. All communications which that Official may desire on behalf of the Company to address to the Bahrain Government concerning amendments to or interpretations of, the lining Lease or to any supplements thereof or concerning any other matters of direct concern to H.K.Govern ment, as indicated by H.B.E's Political Agent, shall be made through H.B.K's Politic a]/\gent in Bahrain. Communications with the Bahrain Govern ment relating only to the conduct or regulation of ordinary company operations m^r be directly between the Chief Local Representative and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government; with copies to the Politi- O cal Agent. The approval of E.L.Government shall be required for the person so designated. A reason able time shall be allowed for the replacement of the Chief Local Representative in the event of the post falling vacant.” Original Clause 6 requires no comment. Original Clause 7. The real import of this clause is understood to mean that the Company acknowledges the power and position of H.^. Government as the Protector of Bahrain. However, tied in as it is with the power of the Sheikh to terminate the concessions, it would seem to place into the hands of H.L.Government an undue legal power which the Company believes it is not the intention of H.^.Government to acquire. The Company wishes to uphold the position of the Govern ment in Bahrain and assuming that H.11.Government desire to retain the Clause, it is suggested it should be altered to express the undertak ing of the Company at all times to pay all proper deference due to the prestige of the Sheikh and to the advice of the Political Agent and_ ' -3- the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf subject always, of course, to the terms of its agreements with the Sheikh. Has this provision grown out of any contrary history during the past few years? Original Clause 8. It is assumed alternative accommodation available elsewhere is within the Sheikt^s domain. 10. Original Clause 9 seems to be accent able. 9. 11 . Original Clause 10. This, with its schedule, seems to overlook the fundamental difficulty with which an operating company is faced in providing for such provision in its marketing contracts. Whilst the terras themselves could be criticised any such criti cism must be deferred to the all-important question ri whether such terms can properly be imposed upon fn operating company having regard to the fact that no buyer from the Company could possibly be asked to submit to a clause in his contract providing for the variation of the terms or termination of the contract to meet an agreed-upon supply of oil and/or loss of control upon the happening of a state of emergency proclaimed as such by H.M.Government. to the arbitration, who would receive notice to arbitration as representing H.M.Government?

Rules for the grant by Local Governments of Licences to prospect for Minerals ami of Mining Leases in British India, originally published tvilh Resolu tion in the Department of Commerce and Industry, No. 7552 — 7581 — 121, dated the 15th September 1913, as subsequently amended. The following rules regulating the grant by Local Governments of licences to prospect for minerals and the grant of leases of mines and minerals have been made by the Governor-General in Council, and sanctioned by the Secretary of State for India in Council. Part I.—GENERAL. 1. No licence to prospect for minerals or lease of mines and minerals can be granted by any Local Government otherwise than in accordance with these rules, except with the previous sanction of the Secretary of State for India in Council, or with that of the Governor-General in Council under any general or special authority which he may have received in this behalf from the Secretary of State in Council. 2. In these rules : “ Collector ” means the Revenue Officer in charge of the district ; “ Local Government ” includes a Chief Commissioner ; “ Person ” includes, besides individuals, a public company registered in India, in the United Kingdom or in a British Colony having a duly empowered agent resident in India, or a syndicate, partner ship or private firm of which one or more of the members reside in India, or which has a duly authorised agent resident in India ; and “ Minerals ” except where the contrary appears from the context includes natural petroleum and natural gas. 3. A certificate of approval or a prospecting licence or a mining lease shall be granted only to a person who is a British subject, or if the persons be a company or firm, only if such company or firm is shown to the satisfaction of the Local Government to be controlled by British subjects. In the case of the death of the person or any other persons to whom the licence or lease has been granted, it shall inure for the benefit of his legal representatives only if they are British subjects, or a company or firm shown to the satisfaction of the Local Government to be controlled by British subjects. 4. For the purposes of these rules the Local Government may, in Provinces where there is a Board of Revenue or Financial Commissioner, delegate to2 such authority all or any of the powers conferred on the Local Government by these rules. 4A. Any order passed by the Collector or District Forest Officer shall be subject to appeal and to revision in such manner and by such authority a» the Local Government may prescribe by notification in the Local Government Gazette. 5. Nothing in these rules shall apply to minor minerals such as slate, building stoned lime stone and clay, the extraction of which will continue to be regulated by such separate rules as the Local Government may lay down- in accordance with local circumstances and requirements. 6. The issue of exploring licences authorising the surface of land to be searched for minerals having been discontinued, the surface of unoccupied and unreserved land, which is the property of Government, may be freely search ed without authority. In the case of occupied land search can be made only where this is permissible under the local law' or rules or with the consent of the occupier. Provided that in the case of Baluchistan and the North-West Frontier Province, no operations for the exploration of the surface of land for mineral shall be carried on, except under a licence granted on such terms as the Local Administration may prescribe.

Only one person shall be named in the certificate. The fee payable therefor shall be Rs. 50, and the certificate shall cover applications in respect of minerals of all kinds. 0. A certificate of approval may be renewed at the discretion of the Local Government on payment of a fee of Rs. 10 if the application for renewal is received wdthin one month after the date of expiry of the original certificate and on payment of a fee of Rs. 50 if the application is received after one month but within three months of the date of expiry of the original certificate. No application for renewal received after three months from the expiry of a certi ficate shall be entertained but a fresh certificate of approval may be granted at the discretion of the Local Government on payment of a fee of Rs. 50. The period of renewal of a certificate of approval has effect from the date of expiry of the original certificate or of a previous renewal as the case may be : pro vided that no renewal shall have retrospective effect for purposes of priority under Rules 23, 42 and 55 beyond the date on which the application for such renewal was filed, The Local Government may delegate to any officer not below the rank of Collector, the power to renew a certificate of approval on- payment of the prescribed fee, in any case in which the certificate holder has carried on operations under a prospecting licence or mining lease within the jurisdiction of the officer to whom the power is delegated. 10. The names of persons to whom certificates of approval have been granted shall be published in the Local Government Gazette, and every appli cation for a prospecting licence or a mining lease shall contain a statement of the number and date of the Gazette notification of the certificate of approval..11.

Collector may at his discretion require the production of the original certificate of approval. 12. Licences or leases previously granted may be held by a grantee who is no longer in possession of a cert ificate of approval. Part II.—PROSPECTING LICENCES. 13.

A prospecting licence shall be granted only in respect of land in which the mines or minerals are the property of Government. 15. Every application for a prospecting licence shall, unless the Local Government shall in any case otherwise direct, be made to the Collector of the district in which the land or some part of the land with respect to which the licence is required is situate. 16. Every such application shall contain the following particulars, name ly (a) The name, profession and residence of the applicant, if he is an individual ; or if the applicant is a company, syndicate, part nership or private firm, its name, and nature and place of business^ and if the place of business is outside India, the name and resi dence of a member or duly authorised agent resident in India..

The Local Government may declare, in respect of any specified area, that in lieu of presenting an application containing the particulars required in rule 16 above, the applicant for a prospecting licence shall adopt the pro cedure set forth below, or such modification thereof as the l.ocal Government may prescribe :— (1) He shall, before forwarding his application to the Collector, de marcate the area applied for in the following method— (a) At every angle or corner of each boundary line or as near thereto as is practicable, he shall fix pegs of substantial material, a 24 standing not less than 2 feet above the surface of the ground, and being not less than 3 inches square or 3 inches in dia meter. (b) If pegs be not obtainable, he may use instead cairns of stones or mounds of earth, having in each case a height of not less than 2 feet and a diameter at the base of not less than 2 feet. (c) The direction of the boundary line on each side of each peg, cairn or mound shall be indicated with reasonable care by a trench having a length of 4 feet, and a breadth and depth of not less than 6 inches : provided that if trenches cannot be conveniently cut, the direction of the boundary lines shall be indicated by finger posts, or in any other manner suitable for the purpose. (d) The pegs, cairns or mounds shall bear or have affixed thereto some distinguishing mark which shall be described in the application. (e) In the case of an application for land on the seashore, it shall not be necessary to mark out the land below high-water level. (/) No peg, cairn, mound, or other mark employed in marking out the land applied for shall be removed or defaced after the application shall have been filed without the permission of the Collector. (2) The application to the Collector shall contain the following parti culars, namely— (a) The name, profession and residence of the applicant, if he is an individual ; or if the applicant is a company, syndicate, partnership or private firm, its name, and nature and place of business and if the place of business is outside India, the name and residence of a member or duly authorised agept resident in India. (h) A description, as accurate as possible, and illustrated by a sketch, of the situation boundaries and area of the land with respect to which the licence is required. (c) A description of the distinguishing mark on the pegs, cairns or mounds constructed to mark out the boundaries of the con cession applied for. {d) The date of marking out the concession applied for. (e) A statement showing, in such detail as may be required by the Local Government, the minerals for which the applicant intends to prospect. &lt;3) The application shall be accompanied by a deposit at such rate or rates as the Local Government may by general order prescribe to meet the cost of survey of the area. (4) Unless the Collector is of opinion that it is not expedient to grant the licence, he shall, as soon as possible after the receipt of the application, cause the land applied for to be surveyed at the expense of the applicant, and the area and all other details ascertained in the course of such survey shall be presumed to becorrect. Provided that the Collector may at his discretion dis pense with such survey, if the boundaries of the area applied for confirm to boundaries already ascertained in a Government sur- • vey, e.g., the boundaries of survey numbers in a revenue survey- 19. On receipt of any application under rule 16 or rule 18 the Collector or such officer as he may authorise to do so, shall note thereon the date and hour of its receipt, and shall deliver to the applicant an acknowledgment stat ing the date and hour of receipt. 20. The Collector shall then, as soon as practicable, inquire whether the grant of the licence applied for is inexpedient, either on the ground that the land described in the application is required for a public purpose or otherwise. 21. Should the Collector be of opinion that it is not expedient to grant the licence, he shall refuse to grant it. 22. Subject to the control of the Local Government, the Collector, if he finds that the applicant is in possession of a valid certificate of approval and that there is no objection to the grant of the licence applied for, may grant to the applicant a licence in such form as may be prescribed. 23. In the case of two or more applications affecting the same land, the prior right to a licence shall, subject to any order to the contrary which the Local Government may in its discretion pass in any particular case, be deemed to lie with the applicant who, being the holder of a valid certificate of approval and after compliance with the procedure prescribed by the rules, shall have been the first to file his application with the Collector. 24. Every applicant shall, before the licence is granted, deposit as security in respect of such licence, a sum of Rs. 100 per square mile or part of a square mile of the area covered by the licence, or with the Collector’s permission, give security to a like amount to the satisfaction of the Collector. 25. Subject to such deduction on account of compensation for surface damage, penalty, or otherwise as the Collector may order, the amount of any deposit made under the foregoing rule, should the depositor afterwards be granted a mining lease, wall be carried to his credit as part of the rents, royalties or deposit money payable under the lease. Or should he decline to receive or fail to obtain any such lease, as aforesaid, the amount will be returned to him on his satisfying the Collector that the condition in rule 30 (viii) has been complied with and on his furnishing the Collector with the information required by rule 33. 26. If a licence is not executed within three months after leave has been granted for it, the right of the applicant to such licence shall be held to have lapsed, unless the Local Government, for special reasons, consents to grant the same notwithstanding the delay or considers that the delay is not attributable to the applicant. 27. A register of applications for prospecting licences shall be kept* in English in the Collector’s office, specifying : (1) Serial number, (2) Name of applicant, (3) Residence of applicant, (4) Date and number of certificate of approval granted to applicant, (5) Date of application, (6) If application received incomplete, the date of completion,6 {7) Situation and boundaries of the land, (8) Estimated area, (9) The minerals for which the applicant desires to prospect, (10) Date of licence, if granted (or date of order of refusal), (11) Period for which granted, with note as to renewal or extension, (12) Fee and royalty payable under rule 30 (ii) and (in), (13) Amount of deposit, and (14) Particulars of disposal or refund of deposit. 28. The register shall be open to inspection by any holder of a valid certi ficate of approval or his duly authorised representative, on payment of such fee as the Local Government may prescribe. 29. A return of licences granted or refused shall be submitted by the Collector at such intervals and to such authority as the Local Government may direct. 30. Every prospecting licence shall contain such conditions as may in any particular case seem necessary, and shall in all cases contain the following conditions: — (i) The licence shall be granted for such term as the applicant may desire, subject to a maximum of two years if the licence grants or includes, the right to prospect for natural petroleum or natural gas and of one year in other cases. If the Collector is satisfied that a longer period is required in order to enable the licensee to complete his search of the land, he may renew the licence for one or more further term or terms not exceeding one year each up to a total period of three years from the date of commence ment of the original licence and, if the licensee is engaged in prospecting for natural petroleum or natural gas, the Collector may, in respect of those minerals only, further extend it by similar terms up to a total period of five years from the date of commencement of the original licence. Provided that, when the licensee has, before the termination of the period of the licence, applied for the grant of a mining lease, the Collector may further extend the period of the licence until a mining lease is granted or for such time as he may deem fit. (ii) The licensee shall pay a fee not exceeding one rupee and not less than one anna per acre of the land covered by the licence for each year or portion of a year of the term for which the licence is granted. When a licence is renewed under the last foregoing condition, a fresh fee shall be payable, subject to the same maximum and minimum charge, for each year or part of a year for which the licence is renewed. But no fee shall be payable for an extension of the term of licence under the proviso to that condition. (iii) The licensee shall pay royalty at a rate not exceeding 15 per cent, of the value on all precious stones won and carried away, and a royalty at the rates specified in Schedule A in Part IV of these rules on all other minerals won and carried away over and above such quantity as is allowed in Schedule B to be taken free for purposes of experiment.■(iv) The licensee shall make and pay such reasonable satisfaction and compensation, as may be assessed by lawful authority in accord ance with the law in force on the subject applying to the lands over which the licence has been granted, for all damage, injury or disturbance which may be done by him in exercise of the powers granted by the licence, and shall indemnify the Govern ment against all claims which may be made by third parties in respect of any such damage, injury or disturbance. Note. —The powers necessary for the proper enjoyment of minerals, the property of Oovemment, together with the methods according to which such powers are to be exercis ed by Government or by its assignees, are governed by the law for the time being in force in each province. Where the law confers such powers on the Local Government or its assignees, the Local Government may make local rules indicating the conditions on which licensees shall have right of access to minerals, the right to use of water in connection with the working thereof, and the like. (v) The licensee shall not cut or injure any tree on unoccupied and unreserved land without the permission in writing of the Collector, or of such officer or officers as he may appoint ; nor, without the permission of the Collector, shall he disturb the surface of any road, or enter on any public pleasure ground, burning or bury ing ground, or place held sacred by any class of persons, or in terfere with any right-of-way well or tank.

Such lease may include so much land, comprising the whole or a part only of the area for which the prospecting licence was granted, as shall not exceed the area specified with respect to mining leases in rule 45. 33. If so required by the Collector, the licensee shall, before the deposit made under rule 24 is returned to him, disclose confidentially to the Collector^ all information acquired in the course of the operations carried on under the licence, regarding the minerals contained in, or the geological formation of, any area not taken up by him under a mining lease. Part ITT.—MINING LEASES- 34. Every application for the grant of a mining lease, not being a lease of a mine of precious stones, shall be presented to the Collector in whose district the land or some part of the land with respect to which the lease is required is situate.

Note. —It shall be competent to the Local Government by general order to direct that an accurate survey be made at the expense of the lessee of all land granted on mining lease, if a map or plan has not been already prepared by the Collector. Such survey may be made at any time after it is decided to grant the lease, the object being to secure an authoritative record of the area covered by the lease. 40. The Local Government may declare in respect of any specified area that in lieu of presenting an application containing the particulars required in rule 38 above, every applicant for a mining lease over an area, in respect cf which he is not already in possession of or has not submitted an application for a prospecting licence, shall adopt the procedure set forth below, or such modification thereof as the Local Government may prescribe :— (1) He shall, before forwarding his application to the Collector, de marcate the area applied for in the following method : (a) At every angle or corner of each boundary line, or as near thereto as is practicable, he shall fix pegs of substantial material standing out not less than 2 feet above the surface of the ground, and being not less than 3 inches square or 3 inches in diameter.

On receipt of any application under rule 38 or 40 above, the Collector or such officer as he may authorise to do so, shall note thereon the date and hour of its receipt, and shall deliver to the applicant an acknowledgment stat ing the date and hour of receipt.11 42. In the case of two or more applications affecting the same land and presented by applicants who are not in possession of, or have not applied for, prospecting licences in respect thereof, the prior right to a lease shall, subject to any order which the Local Government may pass in any particular case, be •deemed to lie with the applicant who, being the holder of a valid certificate of approval and after compliance with the procedure prescribed by the rules, shall have been the first to file his application with the Collector. 43. A register of applications for mining leases shall be kept in English in the Collector’s office specifying, as far as may be, the matters prescribed by rule 27 for the register of applications for prospecting licences. 44. The register shall be open to inspection by any holder of a certificate of approval or his duly authorised representative on payment of such fee as i;he Local Government may prescribe. 45. On receipt of the application from the Collector, the Local Govern ment may, if the applicant is entitled to a lease under rule 32, or if it considers that the applicant should be granted a mining lease, grant the same in accord ance with these rules over such area as it may think fit : Provided that no mining lease shall be granted by the Local Govern ment under these rules so as to cause the total area held under mining leases for minerals of whatsoever kind other than natural petroleum (including natural gas) by the lessee or by those joint in interest with him to exceed ten square miles within the terri tories administered by the Local Government. Provided also that in the case of natural petroleum (including natural gas) the Local Government shall not grant to any one lessee or those joint in interest with him leases for any area exceeding 150 square miles within the territories administered by it. 45 A. No assignment of a mining lease or transfer of any right or interest •thereunder shall be sanctioned by the Local Government except to a person bolding a valid certificate of approval and subject to the condition that the total area (including the area to be assigned or transferred) held under mining leases by the assignee or transferee or those joint in interest with the assignee or transferee within the territories administered by the Local Government shall not exceed 150 square miles in the case of natural petroleum (including natural gas) or 10 square miles in the case of minerals other than natural petro leum (including natural gas). 46. If a lease is not executed within six months after leave has been granted for it, the right of the applicant to such lease shall be held to have lapsed, unless the Local Government for special reasons consents to grant the same notwithstanding the delay, or considers that the delay is not attribut able to the applicant. Note. —Every lease shall before it is executed be approved by the Advocate General or other legal adviser, if any, appointed for the Province. 47. Without the previous sanction of the Governor-General in Council the length of an area held under a mining lease shall not be allowed to exceed four times its breadth : Provided that this rule shall not apply to areas in river beds held on lease for dredging purposes, in respect of which the Local Govern ment may, with the sanction of the Governor-General in Council, make rules as to the dimensions and shape of areas for which such leases may be granted.12 Provided also that the Governor-General in Council may delegate to the Local Government the power to grant exemption from the opera tion of this rule, in respect of specified minerals and subject to such restrictions as to limit of length or otherwise as he may think fit. 48. The boundaries below the surface of all areas given out on mining lease under these rules shall be considered to run vertically downwards towards the centre of the earth. 49. The term for which a mining lease may be granted shall not exceed 30 years, but the lease may contain a clause permitting renewal for a period not exceeding 30 years, on a dead and surfac e rent not exceeding twice the original dead and surface rent respectively, the royalty payable being that which may on the day next following that on which the original lease shall determine, be in force under the orders of competent authority : in the case of iron-ore the original lease may also contain a clause permitting a second renewal for a further period not exceeding 30 years on a dead and surface rent not exceeding twice the dead and surface rent respectively fixed for the first renewal of the lease, the royalty payable being that which may on the day next following that on which the first renewal shall determine be in force under the orders of competent authority. 50. Every mining lease shall contain such conditions and stipulations as the Local Government may in each case consider necessary ; and shall in every case contain the following conditions, namely :— (i) The lessee shall pay a royalty or royalties at the rate specified in the lease, which rate or rates shall be those fixed for the parti cular mineral or minerals in Schedule A in Part IV of these rules ; and if any other mineral shall be discovered by him, then the royalty shall be paid therefor at such rate, not being less than 20 per cent, of the value thereof, as the Local Government may determine, until a mining lease has been obtained in respect of such mineral ; but the lessee shall be entitled within twelve months from the discovery of such mineral to require and obtain such lease for the term then unexpired of his original lease ; provided that, if he declines to take a lease as above provided, the Local Government may give a lease in respect of such mineral to any other person. (ii) The lessee shall also pay for every year after the first year a fixed yearly dead rent at a rate not less than that laid down in Schedule C in Part IV of these rules; provided that no lessee shall pay both royalty and dead rent in respect of the same lease, but only such one of them as may be of the greater amount; and provided further in the case of leases for iron-ore that when a lessee is granted more than one such lease he may, if he so desire,, claim that for the purpose of determining whether royalty or dead rent is payable, all such leases granted to him shall be treated as one concession. In that event he shall be liable to pay dead rent only when the sum of the royalties paid by him in respect of such leases for the year is less than the sum of the dead rents assessed under those leases or is less than such other amount as the Local Government, having regard to the circum stances of the case, may fix as the combined dead rent in respect of all the leases ; and the amount of dead rent so payable shall^ 13 be the amount by which the sum of the royalties paid for the year falls short of the sum of the dead rents or the combined dead rent so determined. (iii) The lessee shall also pay for all land which he may use or occupy superficially for the purpose of the mine a surface rent at the rate specified in Schedule D. (iv) The lessee shall, at his own expense, erect and at all times main tain and keep in repair boundary marks and pillars according to the demarcation to be shown in a plan annexed to his lease. (v) The lessee shall make and pay such reasonable satisfaction and compensation, as may be assessed by lawful authority in accord ance with the law in force on the subject applying to the lands over which the lease has been granted, for all damage, injury or disturbance which may be done by him in exercise of the powers granted by the lease, and shall indemnify the Govern ment against all claims which may be made by third parties in respect of any such damage, injury or disturbance. Note —The powers necessary for the proper enjoyment of minerals, the property of Government together with the methods according to which such powers are to be exercised by Government or by its assignees, are governed by the law for the time being in force in each province. Where the law confers such powers on the Local Government or its assignees, the Local Government may make local rules indicating the conditions on which lessees shall have right of access to minerals, the right to use of water in connection with the working thereof, and the like. (vi) The lessee shall not cut or injure any tree reserved in the lease. (vii) The lessee may, with the previous sanction of the Local Govern ment, assign his lease or transfer any right or interest thereunder subject to the condition that every such assignment or transfer shall, within three calendar months from the date of its comple tion, be registered in the office of the Collector on payment of a fee of Rs. 50. (viii) Unless good cause exists for exemption from this condition a question on which the decision of the Local Government shall be final, the lessee shall commence operations within one year from the date of the execution of the lease and shall thereafter carry them on effectually in a proper, skilful and mining-like manner. Should the lessee cease without such cause to work the mine for a period exceeding two years in such a manner as to produce sufficient mineral to earn a royalty at least equal to the dead rent, it shall be deemed a breach of this condition. Note .—For the purpose of the first part of this condition, such measures as the erec tion of machinery for the purposes of working the mine, although not necessarily on the land covered by the lease, or the construction of roads or tramways in connection with the mine, shall be deemed to be sufficient compliance with the requirement of commenc ing operations. (ix) The lessee shall keep correct accounts showing the quantity and particulars of all minerals obtained from the mine and the number of persons employed therein, and also complete plans of the mine, and shall allow any officer authorised by the Local Government in that behalf at any time to examine such accounts and plans, and shall furnish the Local Government with such information and returns in respect of the aforesaid matter as ' it may prescribe.14 * &gt; A X* (x) The lessee shall allow existing and future licence or lease-holders- of any land which is comprised in or adjoins or is reached by the land held by the lessee, reasonable facilities of access thereto. (xi) The lessee shall allow any officer authorised by the Local Govern ment in that behalf to enter upon the premises comprised in the lease for the purpose of inspecting the same. (xii) The lessee shall without delay report to the Collector the discovery on or within any of the lands or mines demised by the lease of any minerals not specified in the lease. (xiii) Should the royalty or rent reserved or made payable by the lease be not paid within two months next after the date fixed in the lease for the payment of the same, the Local Government may enter upon the said premises and distrain all or any of the minerals or movable property therein, and may order the sale of the pro perty so distrained or so much of it as will suffice for the satisfac tion of the rent or royalty due and all costs and expenses occa sioned by the non-payment thereof ; and, if any royalty or rent remain at any time unpaid for six calendar months after the date on which it is due the Local Government may determine the lease and take possession of the premises comprised therein. (xiv) In case of any breach on the part of the lessee of any covenant or condition contained in the lease, the Local Government may determine the lease and take possession of the said premises ; or, in the alternative, may accept payment of a penalty, not exceeding twice the amount of the annual dead rent, from the lessee. (xv) At the end or sooner determination of the lease, the lessee shall deliver up the said premises and all mines (if any) dug therein in a proper and workman-like state, save in respect of any work ing as to which the Local Government may have sanctioned abandonment. (xvi) The Government shall at all times have the right of pre-emption of the minerals lying upon the land in respect of which the lease has been granted or elsewhere under the control of the lessee, provided that the fair market price shall be paid to the lessee for all minerals taken in pre-emption. (xvii) Should any question or dispute arise regarding the lease or any matter or thing connected with the mines and minerals leased or the working or non-working thereof or the amount or payment of the royalty or rent reserved or made payable by the lease, the matter in difference shall be decided by the Local Govern ment, whose decision thereon shall be final : Provided that any dispute as regards the price to be paid for minerals- taken in pre-emption by the Government from mines other than those of which possession or control has been taken over by Government during war or other emergency shall be determined by two arbitrators one to be nominated by the Local Govern ment and the other by the lessee or in case of disagreement between the arbitrators by an umpire appointed by the Local Government and the decision of such arbitrators or umpire shall be final.15 51. All operations conducted Tinder the authority of these rules within a reserved or protected forest shall be subject to such conditions as the Local Government may by general or special order from time to time prescribe. It shall be a condition of every lease granted under these rules that before the commencement of work within a reserved or protected forest, 30 days’ notice shall be given to the District Forest Officer of the intention to com mence operations, and that the operations shall be conducted subject to any conditions regarding the use of fire that he may prescribe. 52. Every mining lease which includes any portion of a reserved or pro tected forest shall, if it authorises the lessee to fell timber for mining purposes specify the area within which, or the quantity up to which and the terms and conditions upon which, he may exercise that authority. 53. No lease of a mine of precious stones shall be granted except by the Governor-General in Council. The procedure for obtaining, and the conditions of, such lease shall be those prescribed by rules 34 to 50 read as if the Governor- General in Council were substituted for the Local Government. 54. The lessee shall be at liberty to determine the lease at any time on giving not less than twelve calendar months’ notice in writing to the Collector ; and upon the expiration of such notice, provided that all sums due on account of the lease shall have been paid, the lease shall be determined. When a lessee exercises his option of determining a lease, he shall not, except with the pre vious sanction of the Governor-General in Council, be granted subsequently a new lease over a portion only of the land covered by the original lease. Part III A.—MISCELLANEOUS. 55. When both an application or applications for a prospecting licence and an application or applications for a mining lease are presented in respect of the same area, the applicant or applicants for a mining lease not being in possession of a prospecting licence in respect of that area, the prior right to the concession whether licence or lease, shall, subject to any order which the Local Government may pass in any particular case, be deemed to lie with the appli cant who, being the holder of a valid certificate of approval and after com pliance with the procedure prescribed by the rules, shall have been the first to file his application with the Collector : Provided that if the prior right to the concession is held to lie with an applicant for a lease the Local Govern ment may, in its discretion, grant him a licence instead. 56. In cases where a prospecting licence or mining lease has been cancelled, the Local Government may, notwithstanding anything to the contrary here- prospecting licence or a mining lease, over the whole or a portion of the area covered by the original licence or lease and may sell such concession by auction or private treaty or by any other method which they consider to be suitable : Provided that— (i) the person to whom the concession is sold shall be the holder of a valid certificate of approval ; (ii) save for the payment of an initial premium the terms of sale shall conform in every respect to the provisions of rules 24 — 26 and 30—33 in the case of a prospecting licence and to the provisions of rules 45 — 54 in the case of a mining lease, as the case may be.-&gt; * 4*s 1G ♦ Part IV.—RENTS AND ROYALTIES.

We understand that though the Company will in the first place negotiate a separate agreement with the Sheikh covering the unallotted area only it ie their intention eventually to have a consolidated concession agreement which would apply to the jL •*rt whole territory. It is of course'■■■ -■ r,»r~ agreement with H.M.G. Article 5 corresponds to the similar provision in the Debai and Sharjah Political Agreements, as we understand that the Company are not altogether satisfied with the terms of Article XVI of their 1934 Agreement. We think however that the local authorities will have to be asked what provisions are considered essential in this Article in the light of their experience. The remaining Articles and the Schedule are based on provisions in the political agreements relating to Koweit, Qatar, etc. We have, however, tentatively added a proviso to the usual form of Article 8 and should be glad to know v/hether the Admiralty think the addition desirable. The views of the local authorities on this article may also be required. The preamble and first Article allow for signature before the new concession is signed and can be amended if the concession is signed first. 3. You will see that we have included as Article 11 the penalty of termination of the Concession Agreement by the Sheikh, for any breach of the Political agreement. We had supposed that this trilateral arrangement which has been used elsewhere would not be possible in the present case, where part of the concessional area has already been fully developed v/ithout the Company/ Draft (&lt;W10) Wt.25956/5 (SOM) Wt.40880/:Draft Paper. Department. Company being a party to any such arrangement. But we found that Ballantyne himself rather expected that some such arrangement would be stipulated by us, and we therefore propose to try to get it accepted by the Company and the Sheikh. I enclose a copy of a letter v/e are sending him in this connexion. With regard to the enclosure to this letter, we think it desirable to omit in this case the provision for the surrender of the Company 1 s properties to the Sheikh in the event of termination of the lease which has been embodied in the correspond ence relating to other concessions in the Persian Gulf. It would perhaps be asking rather much of the Company to expect it to agree to this, and the termination of the Concession Agreement should afford a quite sufficient penalty by itself. 4.

In the course of the discussion here on the 9th May | regarding the nature of the agreement which H.M.G. would propose to enter into with the Bahrein Petroleum Go. some reference was made to the procedure hy which the Sheikh would take cognisance of it and provide the necessary Sanction' for any Breach ; of its provisions. Perhaps I might explain in more detail the nature of the procedure which we have in mind and which has 'been followed in other similar cases, as you may wish to have the information as early as possible. 2. Y/hen the agreement between the Company and H.M.G. is being negotiated the Company would be invited to express their willingness to agree to the arrangements set out in the enclosure hereto. Upon their doing so, and concluding the agreement with H.M.G., the Sheikh would be given a copy of the agreement, informed of the understanding reached with the Company (as described in the enclosure), and asked to state in writing that he understands these arrangement s/arrangements and agrees to them. On receipt of his reply the Company would he asked formally to signify their acceptance of the arrangements and thereupon H.M.G. would intimate to the Company and to the Sheikh their approval of the Company*s concession. To complete the picture, the arbitration provisions of the concession agreement are formally made applicable to any case of termination of the concession by the Sheikh under the arrangements described above, as you will see from Article 11 of the enclosed revised provisional draft. 3. We now propose to consult the interested Departments upon this draft, and hope to be able to address you at an early date. You will note that slight amendments have been made in Articles 8 and 9 and a more extensive amendment in Article 5, which is now in the form most recently used. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.)

The conditions in question are as follows (a) that the inclusion of the Hawar Islands in the concessional area is subject to the eventual decision of His Majesty’s Government in their adjudication of the claims of the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Qatar to sovereignty over the Islands; (b) that the terms of the agreement between the Company and the Sheikh are approved by His Majesty’s Government; and (c) that an agreement is concluded between the Company and His Majesty’s Government to safeguard the latter's2. /j. £&gt;■' 4 .

Briefly the situation (see paragraphs of rfeightman'e letter) is that the Bahrain Petroleum Company have refused to make an offer for leas territory than the entire Unallotted *rea, including Hawar. For this they are prepared to make payments of two kinds (a) . lunii sum down and (b) payments to De made annually from their present oil field In the Leased Area. Taking (a) and (b) together, their term, are considerably more advantageous to the Bahrain Government than those offered by Petroleum Concessions Limited einoe although under (e) tn e /latt er *s (Signature) (Designation) s. 44.

It will be seen from paragraph 6 of the Shaikh's letter of February 6th that he wishes to close with the Bahrain Petro leum Company offer and enquires from His Majesty's Government what they advise him to do in the matter. 5* in his paragraph 10 /eightman sums up the effect which would result if His Majesty's Government were to insist on the Bahrain Government refuair^ to include iiawar in the Bahrain Petroleum Company's concession. I agree generally with these views and it seems to me definitely that the only course open to His Majesty's Government is to permit tne Shaikh to include lawar in the Bahrain Petroleum Company's concession. 6. I am In cl in ad to agree with the first sentence of '/eightman's paragraph 12, see also paragraph 6 of my Xxpress letter :i 0 .544-S of 3rd November 193a, and paragraph 2 of my telegram \ r o,20 of 9th January. It is possible that if the /haUh some months ago, before the present negotiations had commenced, had been informed that he could not give Hawar to the 'Bahrain Petroleum Company which decision he would have then conveyed to tnem, the latter might then have accepted the position and negotiated accordingly. it i e possible, however, that the company would not have adopted this attitude and in ' any case we must take the situation as w. find it at present. 7. I am not in favour of'the alternative suggested by /eightman towards the end of hie paragraph 12, as I think that w uld be difficult to give adequate reasons to the Shaikh / oror the Bahrain Petroleum Company woy, having obtained Utwar in their concesaion, th^/ahould not xork. it. a.

II. The Bahrain Petroleum Company have refused point blank to make an offer for less than the entire Unallotted Area. III. Petroleum Conc&amp;saions limited have submitted offers for the whole end for the various porta of tha UAaHotted Area. Of these it is only necessary to detail the offer for the Hawar Islands, and w tbe territorial waters of these Islands' 1 , as follows i~ (a) Ka. 4 lakhs on signature; (b) Ka# 2 lakhs annually for 4 years| (c) He. 6 ^ lakhs minimum royalty on discovery of oil in commercial quantities. (EjM* ^Commercial uantity* is 700 tons daily, equivalent to on annual royalty of appro* ximately Bs* 9 lakhs). 4# His Highness the Jhaikh and his advisers, though genuinely anxious to fell in with the suggestion that Hawar should go to Petroleum Concessions ^imibad, have nevertheless been/-ihwii itrir |i(n been coapelltd to consider ho* this would affect thsir financial oecurity. They sss that unless T!©arain has the incredlbls good fortune to possess two or 3tore distinct oil fields below the saall surface of its possessions (one of which oust be located at Haw&amp;r) the net effect of granting a concussion to Petroleum Concessions Limited for the Hawar Islands is an invitation to bankruptcy# *hey see and compare the ;mflrantaad effect of the two offers during the next 15 years, w ich f after excluding the initial payment on signature (the same in both easee) is as follows t~ (1) t'MUl A guarantee of Ks# 2 lakhs for three years y after which the Company are entitled under article 13 of the draft Lease to abandon the concession on six months 1 notice, and would pre sumably do so in the absence of oil indications# Total effective guarantee &lt;*• 6 lakhs# &lt;ii) '.gncajs 1 ?tg&lt;as\r A guarantee of either (a) its# 285 lakhs, vide I(c)(i) above, or (b) ^s# IS?) lakhs under 1(b) (b) only becomes effective in the unlikely event of production from the present Bahrain field failing to provide for (e)# *rom these figures must be deducted the existing guaranteed minimum royalty of Ha# If lakhs per annum or a total of &lt;s# 22 - lakhs for 15 years# The total guarantee is, therefore, at least aa» 165 lakhs and almost certainly Ho# 262 lakha# I take no account here also of the larger offers dapendent on the discovery of oil in the Unallotted Area# The fantastic difference between the guaranteed effect in the two cases is due to the simple fact that the Bahrain Petro leum Company possess an oil field already in production, whereas Petroleum/*-4- Petrol«um Conc^saions Limitadi sr« offarlng for an unaxplorad araa* 5* It may be ocknotrled^ed that the acceptance of ratrolauas Concessions Lisaited 1 s offer for Hawor would probably rot, r#st:lt in the Bahrain Government forfeiting (for immediate purposes' the whole of the snr.s gnareateed by the Bahrain Petroleum Com pany* a offer* for the American Company are unlikely to reduce production to the existing minluum royalty figure» even thoi'^h under the terns of their concession they possess the undeniable right to do so• It would not* however y be surprising if they cut back to, say, an annual production of one million barrels, representing roughly He* 5 lakhs in royalty, as soon as Arabian production is sufficient to supply the balance of Hefinery requirements. The letter prospect is no longer remote. 6 . Equally it ia undeniable that Bahrain will ultimately receive its full royalties on its total oil deposits, ftut, if 3eudi Arable is as prolific as 1© expected, it may be very many years before the 'merican Company is compelled, by the mere necessity of maintaining adequate supplies of ^rude Oil t© the Stefinery, to resume Bahrain production on approximately the present scale. An essential factor to bear in mind, it seems to me, in relation to the two considerations stated above, is that an immediate drop in Bahrain production below the point where resultant royalties enable the ^tate to purchase investments, represents uemonent lose, i«e* in interest. That point is reached, at a rough calculation (which assumes that His Hlghnes would in no circumstances take more than one-third of the royalties for hie personal share) at He. 10 lakhe. 7* From the financial point of view therefore the grant of Hawar to Petroleum Concessions Limited may be nothing less than disastrous. Cne cannot but admire the restraint of Hie HlghnassAHig2m«#d .ilictliui 1 si letter and marvel at the me^nificent loyalty which animetea it. i^everUialeae I venture to eu^aat that it would oe in the laat degree iia|K&gt;litic to take advantage of Hie Hitfhneaa' peraonal willingneaa thus to aacrifioe the interests of iahrain. 8. The preliminary a*ivice which has offered in respect of tiawar is preauflahly due to the following consideration* t- (a) It la obviously desirable to support the candidature of a Company possessing considerable British reorementa tion both in capital and in personnel. (b) There are obvious disadvantages in an American Gil Company operating a concession granted by the Shaikh of Bahrain in an area so closely adjacent to a tar, and particularly inasmuch as that area is under formal dispute ot the sjonsent between Bahrain and t star (even though there can be little genuine doubt that sovereignty reaia with Bahrain). (c) There are also disadvantages in an American Company operating in close proximity to Petroleum •onceaaiona limited's selected field of enterprise in star. (d) In tna past the American Company has displayed little interest in Hawar and, as noted in paragraph 3 of your express letter !?o. C/33? dated the 19th June 1938, its cam representative in London at one time suggested that Hawar should be granted to Petroleum Concessions Limited. 9. It would seem that an adequate rejoinder exists to each of the above considerations, that is to say t- (a) fe may do Petroled Concessions Limited better service if we do not focus the American Company's thoughts on the possibility of damaging the former's prospects In the C^an hinterland (T think the possibilities are sufficiently obvious to need no further specification). |) hen once Kis Majesty's 3overnm«mt award Hawar to Bahrain, the Shaikh of -atar is no longer concerned. If by any chance he were to ettemot to contest the ©ward by force he could presumably be Misauaded* without undue difficulty. (c) So greater disadvantage is involved here than if Petroleum Concessions Limited had obtained a division of the Bahrain Unallotted Area — a possibility which has given His Majesty's Government ho cause for mis giving* Keferrlng also to points (b) and (e). it is to ba remembered that if Petroleum Concessions Limited obtain the Hawar concession and subsequently discover oil/-&amp;» oil th«ro t vh« only &lt;&gt;osalblo lino of export will bo ocroao the atar Peninsula, thus Involving a now sot of difficulties* (d) Any Compeny Is prestuaabiy entitled to revise its outlook before a final dsclslon is taken* 10* However much weight the arguments set out in the immediately preceding paragraph nay c*rx*y one way or th* other, the essence of the existing eituati n is that the Bahrein Petroleum Company’s offer is made dependent on their obtaining the entire tlnallotted Ares* This being the case, and since the details of the present negotiations must Inevitably become public property, it is scarcely too 3ruch to say that the grant of a concession for Hawsr to Petro leum Concessions Limited under the advice of His pasty's Govern ment will be as disastrous to the prestige sad position of His ilajeaty* s Government in ahrein and in this part of the Gulf general ly ae to the haikh and hia administration. The prospects of the distant future (that is to say the fact that ultimately Bahrain will receive its full royalties on its oil deposits) carry no weight in these parts, snd it requires little imagination therefore to realise the dev*;stating efiect of the almost inevitable consent, if Els MajestyGovernment insist on Hawar going to Tetroleusi Concessions Lixalted, — **the British have served their own interests at the cost of 1 million pounds to the Shaikh of Bahrain' • 'he if:, ect cf hostile propa,.‘ndn, overt **&gt;1 cove&lt;v # which might be btitd on such a statement is incalculable* tl# In submitting the foregoing reaw^rks 1 have Uiken no account of (a) the possibility of oil being found in the Unallotted Area, oj (b) the offer which the Bahrain Government might obtain from Petroleum Concessions Limited for the whole of the Unallotted Area, if, on Petroleum Concessions Limited’s obtaining Hswar, the American Company peraisted in their refusal to bid for the balance* I have deliberately excluded (a) since it can at the beet be no more than a remote possibility, unjustified by any visible features /•feature# such ** exist in the ^ehrsin Jehsl 9 the Dsmrr— dome or the Jebel iXikhsn in etsr. or cen it he forgotten that the Bahrain Petroleum Company selected their oreaent conca'ieion* al area as the inoat promising part of l&amp;hraln« Certainly that possibility could not oe taken into serious account in assess ing the values of the present situation* Am for (o) one can only estiisate on the basis of Pet roleum Concuss ions Limited's offer for the ''Leased Area Bahrein 1939'. Here there is — and can be — no Heater guarantee than the comparatively minor sums payable during the period of exploration* IS* As short a time ago as June last year, it would, 1 believe| have been possible for the Bahrain Government to make on excellent bargain with the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited for the Unallotted j rea minus Hawar, and to grant How&amp;r to Petroleum Concessions Limited* The progress of this caee has been attended by such radical alteration of circumstances that that possibility no longer exists* To be frank, } etroleuiB Concessions Limited have been gravely ill-odviaed in the pro secution of their cause; and for the reasons which I have stated above it is no longer possible, without incurring the gravest risk to the prosperity of Bahrain and, in direct con sequence, to the future good relations between His majesty's Government and the Bahrain Ihaikhs, to exert pressure to obtain liawar for them* I suggest there remains only one alternative to the approval of the grant of an unrestricted concession to the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited on the terms which they now offer; and that Is, while allowing the Bahrain Petroleum Company to obtain a concession for the whole Unallotted Area, to insist that no operations shall be conducted in Hawar until such time as His Klgnness the Shaikh, acting on the advice of His Majesty's Government, may /- &lt;**&gt;may pronounce them unoojootionfitle. I do not apocifically urge the latter su&amp;goetion but It smy perhepe ooaiiend Itself to VU ^ajeetjr'• lovermnent for « variety of reasons# ut in that event I beg to stress the need for Hia J'ajeaty* * Governraont to lend tiieir old to Bahrain by explaining as fully as they rsay think fit their objections to tha Bahrain *'*troleua Company operating at once in Hatter, and by using their influence to ensure, in discussion &gt;vith the Coi-yzny' i representatives in Bonion, that there is no reduction in the minimum figures now offered either for royalty or for the Bahrein share of the refinery 'throughput*. Id. It Is dist&amp;ateful to b * compelled to recommend the withdrawal of the support hitherto afforded to c partially British Company in its attempts to obtain a footing in Bahrain, nevertheless it seeris inevitable to me that commercial advantages must yield to the over-riding Interests of His llajesty*® Government and of the Bahrain State. 3d/- H.

To meet the large sum of 63 - lahhs commencing at the 5th year, it is essential that every effort be made in the first four years to produce oil, and it is to the Company's advantage that production be commenced even before this. ^.0 ensure early production as far as possible, X can assure Your highness that geological ana drilling programmes will be prepared 00 obviate any delay, and work will be pressed lorwaro with maximum real and energy. fS n&gt; L Wlli De formed t0 develop the oil resources the Hawar area at an early date to a point wnere steady oil production can be maintained, and its operations, plana and progress can be investigated at any time by Your Highness. It is hardly necessary to bring to .o i- Highness * 3 notice the immense advantages in the future of having two separate revenue producing Companies within your borders. 6 P.C.L. 2 nd February 1939A pK ARTICLE A.

One natter was that certain areas or land should be excluded froa the agreement as in some oases they were used by nis highness for hunting purposes. The other natter was the old question of ensuring that increased import of oil should not reduce the output of Bahrain oil. These two matters were the subject of discussion lasting about four hours. eventually a formula was arrived at regarding the exclusion areas* that the island of 'Da-al-^asan^, the remainder of ^anamah island and kuh&amp;rraq ahoula not be drilled in without permission from His Highness which would not be withheld if the company showed reasonable proof of indications of oil, such per mission to he given without additional payments or obligations* Regarding refining of Arabian oil a xoraulu was discussed to the effect that the figures given, i.e« 9 half the total output of 2Q,0u0 barrels daily should be the lowest figures and the company would do its best to keep the output at a higher amount. Certain other matters were mentioned such as a clause stating that in case of war all places inside the concession area could be used freely for military defence measures. a revision in the wording of the section regard ing employment of Bahrain subjects was mentioned also a elsuse referring to right of passage of ships or bdats in waters included in the concession.

Dear Sin Following consideration by my Company of the letter of January 3rd, 1939, signed by Shaikh Pohoraed bin Isa, Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa, Shaikh Sulman bin Hamad, and yourself and as a result of further discussions between us, my Company is prepared to amend the offer made in my letter of December 28, 1938, to read as follows, and requests that you advise His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain accordingly. &amp;y Company is prepared to pay His Highness the sum of Hs. 4,00,000 upon the granting of a concession covering all territory, including territorial seas and the lands submerged under those seas, now under the dominion of His Highness or later acquired by him or his successors within the period covered by my Company*s present Mining Lease, other than that already held by my Company under its oresent Mining Lease. It is my Company*s intention that its present Mining Lease will be extended to cover the Unallotted Area to which the present offer pertains, such extension to include the following obligations applying specifically to the Un allotted Areaj My Company will pursue, with diligence and without unnecessary delay, geological work in the Unallotted Area including structure drilling and geophysical work if neces sary. My Company will drill test wells for oil wherever geological evidence warrants, commencing operations on the first test well not later than 2^ years after the da.e such Concession is granted, if a favorable area has been found. If oil is discovered, my Company will continue drilling further wells until oil in commercial quantities (daily average of 500 tons produced in accordance with good oilfieldpractice) has been obtained or until the area is no longer deemed favorable. Upon discovery of oil in commercial quan tities my Company will continue drilling within the productive area until the requirements of good oilfield practice have been met, this obligation^ however being subject to suspension during such time as wells then drilled are capable of a total daily average of at least 1,000 tons of oil, produced in accordance with good oilfield practice. In adlition to the above obligations applying specifi cally to the Unallotted Area, my Company will also agree to increase its drilling obligation under the present Mining Lease. During the period of one year following the date such Concession is granted, my Company will maintain at least 4 strings of tools in continuous operation within the area co vered by the present Lease. The royalty provisions of Article YII of the present Mining Lease will continue over the larger area and my Com pany will undertake that the a ount received by His Highness in respect of royalties shall not be less than He. 12,50,000 per year for a period of 15 years from the date such Conces sion is granted, nor less than Hs. 17,00,000 per year for the same period if oil in commercial quantities is found outside the area ^aready held by my Company Ander its present Mining Lease, providing the wells drilled are capable of pro ducing the equivalent amount of oil in accordance with good oilfield practice and subject to Article IV of the present Mining Lease amended as followsi f, The Sheik# undertakes to give all the protection X in his power to the Company and to their staff and laborers in any part of his territory from thefts, highway robbery, assault, £c. Similarly the Sheikh undertakes to protect all the property of the Company and of their employees which may be exposod to wilful damage or to possible loss by theft. m'If the Company^ work is delayed by such events as are mentioned in this Article or by force majeure either An Bahrein or elsewhere then the period shall be added to the period for which this lease is granted and the annual minimum royalty provided for in this Agreement shall not be payable in respect of such delay* 'Force uajeure as used in this Agreement includes the Act of God, vis major, war, insurrection, riot, civil commotion, fide, storm tidal wave, flood, lightning, explo sion, fire, earthquake, malice or negligence or default of any third party and any other happening (whether solely due to the forces of nature or not) which the Company could not reasonably have foreseen or if they had foreseen, could not reasonably have prevented, averted or controlled* M Following the 15 year period, my Company will undertake that the amount received by His Highness in respect of royalties shall n&lt;bt be less than Is. 3,00,000 per year if oil in commercial quantities has been discovered in the 'Unallotted Area' and Rs. 1,50,000 per year if such oil has not been found, both of these figures being subject to the delay clauses above and the la-ger being suoject to the 'ability to produce' clause as well. Wy Company will also undertake that, for the same 15 year period, not less than one-half the oil processed in the Bahrain refinery up to a total refinery throughput of 20,000 barrels daily, and if oil in commercial quantities is found outside the area laready held by my Company under it_s present lining Lease tnat not less than one-half the oil processed in the Bahrain refinery up to a total refinery throughput of 25,000 barrels daily, shall be oil produced in the territory of Bahrain, provid ing the wells drilled are capable of producing that much oil in accordance with good oilfield practice, and subject to the present Article IV amended as above.The above menti my Company,while it can make no fu ther guarantee, is pleased to assure His Highness that, In the event this Concession is granted, it has every e xpec tat ion of being able to maintain the production of Bahrain oil at least at a figure approximat ing the present production so long as the wells drilled are capable of producing that much oil in ac ordance with good oilfield practice, My Company is also prepared to agree that, although they will be included in the area covered by the Concession, my Company will not drill on Umm Nassan Island, nor within the municipal boundaries of Manama and Muharrak, nor in the vicinity of hunting lodges now established on Manama Island, without first obtaining the permission of His Highness, Ther^ will of course be no further payment or considerstion in return for these permissions, when granted. In this amended effer, my Company has met all the wishes of His Highness up to the limit of its ability to do so with out jeopardising the economic interests of the Company. It has made an offer for the Unallotted Area in its entirety which guarantees a continuation of income to Bahrain from its oil resources far beyond what it thinks any other Company can possibly make. In addition to these guarantees, my Company has stated What its expectations are as regards the amount of oil it will be in a position to produce from Bahrain if a Concession covering the remainder of His Highness* domain is gra ited to it. The strength of such intentions on the part of my Company is well indicated by its past performance in His Highness* territory, v/herein it has unfailingly far exceeded its stated obligations. 1 should like to point out also that the probability of those intentions being fulfilled is further expanding•ui.3 Licjuizss ^ikh Jir n-.&amp;ua shaikhs ^obod&amp;a. ^JkIuILsIi nua Mr* I* Y. raok«?i-, * Mr. ^hr^f # ^aoretiiry to Major Hclod&amp;w ) miujor dolm&amp;a ^tat^d that h&amp; hca reoeivad tele^raphio iastructions from his coapany teiiiag him to a** lor a private interview with Mi# Eighneea* He requested His Bighiiess to ^iv© hie a hearing without interrup tion. l® then u.iomod his Highnaea that he wished to withdrew his pravioue application for the *»hole unallotted area* land end sea, and to sobait a new offer for the Eawar islands end the waters* The new draft agreement vms produoaa, in English with an Arabic note showing the changed tans* 1 ha terns briefly were ss follows:- 1* Initial payment k 3 lakhs which was raised during the discussion to four lakhs. £• Annual payment, until oil in eomner- oiial vuEniity aeclared, h 6G,u00/- 3* loyalty h 3/8 per ton. 4* Minimum royalty, after oil in Conner-* ciul quantity declared, 3 Lsiths 1 quantity, 1400 tons per day* in first 4 ye^rs 4.00U fe^t. ihe .irabic note oontainiiig all tne particulars of the above terma hanued to ^h&amp;ikn kohc^yd oin Isa &amp;ho tola His Hi^imess that &amp;oula examine it in detail* -haiAli fcohoaed retained the ^rablc note ana the English draft was retained by the -adviser.

The first two .-re In my view very serious inaccuracies and in cannot understand how the misunderstanding arose which led to their inclusion in your summary* ( a ) Your pa ge 2 para a . I did not hear any allusion to myself as 'Mumathal al Doulah 1 ** ^either did Sir. Packer nor Mr* Ashraf hear Shaikh Mohammed explaining away the inaccurate designation, and can only think tills occurred before tay arrival* I should like to make it clear that if His Highness from any message conveyed to him from the India Ofi'Ice by you or the Political Agent gained this impression that I was an 'accredited representative of the British Government' this has never been alluded to by me eitner directly or through intermediaries. (b) X-Our page 2 last para .Hls nignness aws not told by ttr. Ashraf that 'he should not sell the friendship of the British Government'. Mr. Ashraf stated as ioliows 'AI sadaa&amp;h i&amp; tatbe &amp;l derahim' (friend ship does not follow money). We think that the word 'Tatba'(follow) has been mistaken by you for a part of the verb 'Ba' (sold) ( r, i&amp; tuba' would not be sold). Mr. Packer reiatiahers Mr. Ashraf using the phrase 'friendship does not follow money'. Neither Mr. Ashraf nor Mr. Packer heard Shaikh Mohammed criticise the expression in the light suggested by Mr* Belgrave*s notes. bhaikh Mohaianjed to our recollection stated 'Hadhala yedkhol bii»Aqle' this is usually intrenreted »this is increaible* - ^his is unreasonable*, but as Mr. Belgrave puts it 'This is an unsuitable thing to say' is not actually entirely wrong although with the previous misinterpretation of the context it gives a completely erroneous idea of the whole point. ( c ) P&amp;kg, , Pfcfk. ,1* 'His Highness took some pert in this discussion but made no comments in the suggestion' We think our interpretation that H.H. raised no objection and in fact displayed a helpful attitude gives a more accurate picture of the impression given by His Highness.
