After further disturbances in 1897 he took ‘ bast ’ with a Tangis- tani chief, and was later deported. He went to Tehran where he was already in touch with the Atabeg Aazam, Mirza AH Asghar Khan who had been farming the Customs of the ports for some39 time. In course ot time he attained an outstanding position as merchant with considerable influence over politicians. Deputy for Bushire in first Majlis. Following the seizure of arms from arms-traders in Bushiie by the Persian authorities in 1898 ; encouraged his associate Haji Sayyid Ismail Shabankarehi to proceed to Tehran and petition Nazaffar-ud-Din Shah foi redress, and by bribing the Ababeg secured the grant of the large tribal district of Mamasanni m Fais f 01 the phabankareh brothers on the false plea that they were Sayyids deprived unjustly of then ^ tiading wealth. His share in the transaction was half the district. In a few years on the death of the bhabankareh brothers he obtained the sur render by their heirs of the other half. His diffi culties as an absentee landlord, with his tribal tenants, extortionate demands for high rents and intrigues to got Soulat-ud-Douleh on the one hand, and Qawam-ul-Mulk on the other, to buy a share m his holding in the region, have caused much disturbance, antagonism between the two magnates, and loss of life in Fars. Owing to his influence with the Government 1923 on the subjugation of Humai- jan district by the troops he put in a claim that :t was included in Mamasanni ; and he also intrigued with Soulat-ud-Douleh in upsetting the A. P. 0° C. agreement with 1 he Kashkulis with the pretention that an almost extinct offshoot of the Mamasanni tribes, the Muhammad Salihi, had once inhabited part of the hill region where the Oil Company et Bikarz are working, on the strength of which he advanced a claim for shares in the A. P. 0. C. under taking there. His disagreement with Lynch Brothers over the Shalileh shed near Ahwaz gave the Legation much trouble 1905. Took part in the reform movements, and he became unpopular with the nationalists in 1909 Took a prominent part in the proposed National Bank which failed. Late in reign of Nasir-ud-Din Shah, obtained a Farman to exploit Keel Oxide of Iron on the Isle of Hormuz but had practically ceased to export by 1897. In 1905 in England he concluded an agreement with Messrs. Strick and Co. to export 8,000 tons of red oxide. Some years later his concession was revoked, but by 1921 he had regained it. He claims rights- over other minerals, such as sulphur and salt, on the:-ground that his concession covers all minerals. He has a spinning factory in Resht. With insufficient capital himself he has by intrigue and corruption thwarted the development of mineral workings and other enterprises, and is an unsatisfactory and crooked character His eldest son, Muavin-ut-Tujjar committed suicide : his second son Aqa Riza, &lt;n unsuccessful candidate to represent Bushire in the Majlis 1923, was educated at Oxford : his younger sons, .Amir Humayun, (q. v.) and Aqa Muhammad Sadiq were also at School in England.

From 1906 to the outbreak of war in 1914 was with his brothers and father, on friendly terms with the Besidency in Bushire and members of the staff, with whom visits frequently exchanged. Shaikh Husain often sought the good offices of the Besidency in his difficulties with the Governors of the Ports. During those years the Chahkutahi Shaikhs were constantly engaged in their long-standing blood feud with the neighbouring Angali District, and on bad terms with Zair Khidhar of Tangistan : they were also engaged in smuggling arms and tea through the Tangistan ports.

He made a pilgrimage to Karbaba in 1913 and returned more fanatical than before. On the removal of the German Consul and residents at Bushire in March 1915 by British troops he pro fessed indignation at the breach of Persian neutrality and his determination to obtain reparation. In this course he was incited by officers of the (Swedish) Gen darmerie and, forgetting his long relations with the British, welcomed Wassmuss and other German em issaries and became the leader of the anti-British move ment in concert with Zair Khidhar of Tangistan and tne Zabit ol Borazjun. After the occupation of Bushire by British troops in August 1915 he declared open war against the British and Bushire and night after night parties of Chakutahis generally led by Shaikh Muhammad or other of his sons, passed the barbed wire entanglements, raided the British posts and private residences killing sentries and carrying off prisoners : Shaikh Muhammad in person attacked the Russian Consulate-General on the sea-shore on one occasion.

In April 1921 the Governor of the Gulf Ports, Mas’ud-us-Sultan (q. v.) chiefly for monetary reasons allowed Shaikh Muham mad to return to Ahmadi and turned out Abbas Quli Khan Angali. Since the departure of the S. P. R. in October 1921 Shaikh Muhammad has sought in various ways to make himself objectionable in revenge both to the British in Bushire and the Angali and other pro-British Khans of 1915-21. With this object he has entered into close alliance of interests with Mirza Ali Kazaruni tLe deputy to the Majlis in Tehran and his son Mirza Abdur Rahman in Bushire : and by correspondence with the newspaper editors of Shiraz and Tehran made a great play of his services in the nationalist cause ot his father and family. In 1923 he caused the remains of his fathers and his brother Khaz’al to be re-buried under a special edifice at Imamzadeh on Bushire is a,n , the occasion being given a ‘ nationalist complexion.
