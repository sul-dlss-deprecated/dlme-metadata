Only the hands are indicated in relief, each holding a hoe. Each sports a beard and a non-striated tripartite wig. A bag is incised over the left shoulder. The hands are each positioned over the lappets of thw wig. None of these ushabtis is inscribed.\r\nCondition: The group ranges in color from a light blue to green. Some show good traces of glaze while others show no remaining glaze whatsoever. Several show spots of discoloration and one (37.195E) shows chipping on the left side of the head.\r\nComments: Although these ushabtis did not all come from the same mold, they show such stylistic affinities and are uniform enough in size that we can conclude that they most likely came from the same burial.\r\n\r\n", "medium": "Faience", "dimensions": "4 1/8 x 1 x 3/4 in.
