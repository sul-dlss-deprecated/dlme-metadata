I have just heard from de Gaury that the Shaikh has broached the subject again. Apparently the Secretary of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Compaq Board (l£r. Kemp) when at Kuwait strongly encouraged the Shaikh and offered to be the medium for the transaction. de Gaury has suggested t o t he Shaikh that he should write to Be Bavillands 1 direct for a catalogue and thinks that when the Siraikh realises the cost, the idea may fade away again. It is possibly born of a desire to be one up on Bahrain. 3. I do not think that there is anything to be done, but let you know in case Be Havillands 1 ask you about Kuwait. 4.

I presume if would be flown out by the selected pilot so that the cost of delivery should not be very heavy - landing and housing fees, fuel and pilot's expenses en route. (b) £1,000 seems a reasonable estimate for remuneration of the pilot and that is what we recently suggested in the case of Sheikh A1 Kaf of the Hadramaut who is also contemplating acquiring an aeroplane. There is also the matter of housing the aeroplane in Koweit and some form of shelter will be necessary, though I do not imagine it should be very expensive. 1 enclose a copy of a letter written to Plood to-day on the same subject.

W. 1. 8th December 193^. ly dear George, You will have seen the D.O#T. letter ot 21st November to the Colonial Office, of which copies were sent to the Foreign Office, about the Jheiteh of KoweiVs interest in purchasing a snail cabin aircraft. I now enclose copy of a letter which I have had from Flood . We agree that it would be well to ascertain the Political Resident’s views, and if you see no objection we might consult him by this week’s air Eiail as in the draft of which I enclose a copy. The statements in that draft as regards cost, etc. are based on telephone conversation with the Air linistiy. It seems fairly clear in any case that a decision on this question is unlikely before a decision has been taken on the main Koweit oil concession,and that to some extent may ease the situation so far as the Foreign Office are concerned.

LAIIHIVAITE. i. 1.Vv A 98145/32. r 426 o 2 Dear Laithwaite, With reference to letter No.7003/IS32 of the 21st of November from the Department of Overseas Trade (a copy of which has been sent to you direct) about the desire of the Sheikh of Koweit to purchase aircraft of British manufacture, I enclose herewith a copy of an interim reply which I have sent to barren. We should he very glad if you would let us know whether you see any objection to helping the Sheikh in the required direction. You will probably wish to consult the Resident in the Persian Gulf. We can write from here, but we are inclined to think that this is a matter in which any communication snould issue from the India Office. Yours sincerely, J.z.cs. J.G. LAITHWAITE, ESQ.THE HONOURABLE C.C. PAR ER, O.B.E. - r . ^ # fiQEI. 98145/32. Dear larrer, Tour official letter Mo.7003 of the 21st of November about the Sheikh of Kuwait’s proposed aeroplane has just come to me. Normally, of course, there would be no objection to your proceeding as you suggest, but things are not normal. There are two sets of people negotiating with the Sheikh for oil concessions: the Eastern and General Syndicate who represent United States oil interests and the Anglo-Persian. The Syndicate gave the Sheikh a large car some time ago and this may be the retort courteous on the other side. There is also the tisk of trouble if the uheikh goes flying into Saudi Arabia and crashes there. (He is no stranger to flying and lately was taken to Baghdad by a Hoyal Air Force machine and back by a M Puss Moth'•) So we shall have to consult the Foreign Office and India Office before we can reply even on a silly &amp; DOTING STHSKT. 2nd December, 1932.silly point like this. Meanwhile,you might note to delete ’Iraq 1 from the address. Basrah is, of course, in Iraq but Kuwait is independent and the Sheikh is very - and rightly - touchy on the subject. If he got a note addressed ’Iraq 1 it would not prejudice him in favour of the writer. Yours sincerely, (Sgd) J.E.W. Flood.political Department. — * This enquiiy (which no houht originates in the anxiety of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to counter-balance Major Holmes' activities in Koweit] might perhaps have been more appropriately addressed to the India Office by the D.O.T., but the point is hardly worth pursuing. 2. The Air Ministry telephone that they see no objection to the proposal from either the service or the Civil Aviation points of view; that an aeroplane * j of the type in question would cost about £1200; and that the most satisfactory method of arranging for its upkeep ana for flying it, etc. would be that the Sheikh should engage a (British} pilot-mechanic, who would cost about £1000 a year. They will prepare a statement which can be communicated to the Sheikh. I said that so far as we were concerned I aid not think that we should see any objection to His &amp; excellency acquiring an aeroplane, but that ca it was a question of a European pilot living at Koweit the Resident would probably be interested. It was agreed that at this early stage it was perhaps unnecessary to go into the various points v\hich might arise ana that our best course would be to see how the sheikh reacted on finding the expense involved. 3. A copy of the D.C.T. letter of 21st November has been sent^e Bushire and copies of further correspondence will be similarly sent.Dear Colville, A friend of nine employed by the An^lo Persian Oil CO. at present residing in the protectorate of Kuwait in the Persian Gulf writes to me that Sheik of that Island or Country, whichever it is, would like particulars of small cabin aircraft of British moke with a view to purchase. I wonder if your Department could obtain iron the De Haviland Aircraft Co., The General Aircraft coinpany of croydon, and similar firms, particulars that the ahoik asks for and send them to him by Air Mail.
