(a) The reason why Snglish ammunition is cheap in Iraq is because it is plentiful, and it is plentiful because it was the ammunition in use by the British in the past, and is the ammunition of Iraq forces today. Old dumps and present day theft account for the quantity to be had. Some soldiers in the Iraq army sell clips. (b) The immediate source, for Iraq, of the Turkish and German rifles and ammunition is both from Saudi Arabia via Nejf area and from Syria via the Jebel Senjar area; but the majority of good weapons and ammunition come from Nejd. In Syria the bad or M imitation w Turkish ammunition is made secretly in the towns, from old lead. In Northern Saudi Arabia the servants of the Provincial Governors sell arms and ammunition, but arms are obtainable in all ^asim and Jebel Shammar towns, in each of which there are armourers shops. (c) zilfi and Shagra in qasim are in particular centres / R.T.Peel Esquire, M.C., The India Office, 1 ondon 0\ centres for arias and ammunition ilfi Muhammad I bn Rashid is an active merchant, and in Shagra, Naar and Ali al Asua Kharaiji, are purreyors. They buy rifles, from the quantity always in circulation and available, for example when replaced by newer ones received by individuals, from the Saudi Oovern- ment, either in the form of a 'service issue' to Royal servants and soldiers, or as presents to Shaihhs and other Bedouin followers of the King# These ^asim merchants also sell to Qataris and Omanis, but most arms go to Iraq by one of the many desert paths or one of the six caravan routes in use to that frontier# (d) They correspond with Nejefi merchants about their trade, but apart from consignments, which are not great, there ia a continual drift of arms and ammunition towards Iraq through the tribes, particularly at the time of the restocking of the Saudi Bedouins in Iraq# Nearly every Bedouin from Saudi Arabia then brings 100 rounds for sale, as it is a convenient and easily convertible stock on which there is profit# (e) The main sources of ammunition supply to tribesmen in Iraq are therefore (a) through the underpaid servants of Ibn Saud and thence through Saudi tribesmen, and (b) from soldiers of the Iraq army# 3.

Confidential . D.O. No. 648-3. The Residency, Bushire, the 29th November, 1938. My dear Peel, Could you please refer to the record of a conversation held at the Foreign Office on October 4th 1938 with the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs received as an enclosure to India Office Express Letter No. P. Z.7136/38, dated the 8th November 1938. 2. With reference to that part of the conversation which dealt with Kuwait I have the following comments to offer. 'Mr. Baxter referred to the reference in Taufiq Suwaidi's aide-memoire to Kuwait as a centre for extensive arms traffic and smuggling. Ke would like to consider, in the first place, the statement that there was an important illegal traffic in arms into Iraq.. Hitherto, he believed, His Majesty’s Government had not received any evidence to show that any such smuggling of arms was, in fact, taking place. In fact, the British authorities in the Persian Gulf seemed to be fairly sure that no arms v/ere now entering Kuwait, at all events by sea. He asked whether the Iraqi Government were able to produce any evidence to show that smuggling of arms did, in fact, take place through Kuwait.' With regard to the sentence: 'The British authorities in the Persian Gulf seemed to be fairly sure that no arms were now entering Kuv/ait, at all events by sea.' The/ R. T. Peel Esquire, M. G. , The India Office, London. f2 . i/ The British authorities in question consist of the .Senior Naval Officer and myself. The Senior Naval Officer was certain that very few if any arms enter Kuwait by sea - vide Admiralty letter to the Foreign Office, No. M.03097/38 dated the 4 th August 1938. I am equally certain that no arms are smuggled from Kuwait to Iraq by land - vide my Express Letter No. 427-3, dated the 21st July 1938, to the Air Officer Commanding, British Forces in Iraq, especially paragraph 7 in which I summed up the situation. In these circumstances could not the Oulf case have been put a little stronger ? '#hat I feel is that unless our case is put strongly the Iraqi Oovernment will continue to return to the charge with their customary vague accusations for which they can produce no proof. 3 . M Major Edmonds added that, to his personal knowledge,as a result of his conversations with Iraqi tribesmen, it was quite a frequent occurrence for an Arab to buy a rifle in Kuwait for £3 or £6 and to travel with it to Iraq, where he would sell it for about twice that amount. The fact was that Kuwait had become a recognised market where Arabs, whether would-be smugglers or not, went to purchase arms. Ke was quite prepared to believe that the British authorities in the Persian Oulf were right when they said that no arms entered Kuwait by sea, but it was absolutely certain that somehow or other these arms were available for sale in Kuwait.' You will see that Edmonds seized upon the point that no arms entered Kuwait by sea, and implied that arms did enter by land. with regard to the rest of ais remarks3 . I have no doubt that he is perfectly correct in stating that an odd rifle or two can now and then be picked up at Kuwait, It is not this, however, against which the Iraqis complain but against a regular traffic on a large scale from Kuwait. Edmonds 1 implication that Kuwait town is now a thriving arms traffic centre is entirely without foundation. 4. With regard to other forms of smuggling. 'Mr. Baxter informed His Excellency that His Majesty's Government had, in fact, received an expert report, from v/hich it appeared that the Iraqi authorities might be able to give smuggling from Kuwait a decisive blow if they were to take certain additional measures, e.g., control by aeroplanes and armoured cars, together with drastic measures against those organisations or individuals in Iraq who must be assisting in smuggling on such a large scale as had been suggested by His Excellency.' I was glad to see that Baxter pressed the point that the Iraqi Government should take anti-smuggling measures in Iraq itself. These measures the Iraqi Government could easily put into practice but refuse to do. In this connection please see paragraiMis 2, 3 and 4 of ny letter No. 316-3, dated the 27th March 1937&gt; to Clark Kerr. You will see that Edmonds himself, Sargon of the Iraq Police and Naji al Asil, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, were all of the opinion that the Iraqi authorities could take certain anti-smuggling measures behind the lines in Iraq itself. In point of fact the Iraqi authorities have taken no such measures. 5 . I presume that the 'expert report” is that of yard given in Bagdad Savingram No. 140, dated the 4th December 1937&gt; to the Foreign Office. It has always been the/the line of the Iraqi G-overnment that they could not stop the smuggling except by measures which are prohibitively expensive. In this connection please see paragraph 13 of my letter No. 864-S* dated the 11th November 1935&gt; to the India Office. The position as it appears to me is that the Iraqi Government can well deal with the smuggling by the employment of a few armed cars, as they are doing at present, assisted by measures behind the lines which they refuse to put into operation. 6 . I must confess that after our unfortunate experience over the tea question I am inclined to suspect the Iraqi Government of exaggeration in their statements of losses from smuggling. In that case the Iraqi Government stated that the import of H smuggled’' tea from India into Iraq via Kuwait was 'paralysing” the tea trade in Iraq. »e accordingly took the matter up with the Shaikh of Kuwait who imposed an embargo on the tea in question into his State. The Iraqi Government took no steps whatever to prevent the tea entering into Iraq. The consequence was that dhows instead of landing tea at Kuwait merely landed it at Basra. By his embargo both the Shaikh of Kuwait and ourselves were unpopular locally (vide correspondence ending with my letter No. 503 j dated the 18th March 1938 to Metcalfe). x I am sending copies of this letter to Peterson, Metcalfe and de Gaury. Yours sincerely, (Sd. ) T. C. Powle. * sent under Printed letter No. 649-3 of the 29th November 1938.' ~ ' i. i.. i. P.Z.7168/38 INDIA OFFICE; WHITEHALL, S.w'.l. 9 th N ov emD e r, 19 38 Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State to forward for the consideration of the Government of India, a corjy ol a letter from the Foreign Office relative to certain conversations recently held with the Foreign Office by che Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject oi Kowe it, with particular reference to the prejudice bo the security of Iraq and the loss to Iraqi revenues stated to be caused by smuggling of arms and of dutiable goods generally from Koweit into Iraq. 2. On the subject of the alleged smu;_glin of arms from or through Koweit into Iraq the views of thePolitical resident in the Persian Gulf have recently been expressed in the correspondence resting with his demi-official (fiz.wJ*) letter of the Yth October, No. C/744. It is clear from I cLis correspondence that the smuggled arms do not enter Koweit by sea but come (if they enter Koweit at all) from Saudi Arabia. The information available to the P.oyal Air Force in Iraq does not suggest that the arms are dealt with by Koweiti middlemen, while the Political Resident finds it difficult to understand why arms craffickers on the way i rom Saudi Arabia to Iraq should enter Kov/eit territory at all. Even if it is the case Aiat the alleged illicit arms traffic is carried on by isolated parties passing through the dese*rt parts oi Koweit on their way from Saudi Arabia tio Iraq it The Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department. (f.i.ssrf/ti)2 . seems unreasonable to expect the Sheikh, v/ith the means at his disposal, to control traffic across the Saudi- Kov/eit frontier when the Iraqis, with their greatly superior resources and the frontier customs police organisation which they now maintain, are apparently unable to check the illicit traffic in arms across their own frontier. 3. It will however be seen from the enclosures to the Foreign Office letter that the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs and the British Adviser in the Ministry of the Interior are convinced (though definite evidence was not adduced by them) that the smuggling 01 arms across the Koweit-Iraq frontier has assumed serious proportions, and assert that it is facilitated by the fact that Xoweit has become a recognised market for the sale of arms where they can be bought freely and cheaply. The Secretary of State feels that it is impossible to dismiss lightly this very definite conclusion formed by the Iraqi authorities, contrary though it is to the views expressed by the Political Resident in his letter of the fth October, referred to above, and should there bo any foundation in fact for their description of the situation in Koweit, he would share the disquiet with which it is viewed by the Foreign Office. Bven though it may be admitted that the responsibility for the control of their own frontier rests with the Iraqi Government, it is clear that His Majesty's Government could not expose themselves to the reproach -that they are tolerating the existence, in a State under* their protection, of a traffic in arms which directly or indirectly/tmmmmmmmrnmmmmmumt , —■ Hi Hf ■ I -I 4 ./ * # 3. indirectly contributes a menace to the security of a neighbouring State. I am therefore to request that the Political Resident may be ashed to make further investigation into the matter in the light of the Iraqi Minister’s contentions, sc far as may be possible pending the production of any detailed evidence which the Iraq authorities may be able to supply. Even ii further examination tends to confirm the statement made by the Political Resident in his express letter of the 21st duly No. 427.S. to the Air Officer Commanding Iraq that nobody in Koweit from the Sheikh downwards, obtain any profit from this traffic, or is in any way engaged in it, the Secretary of State feels that it is desirable, if only to provide an effective answer to the Iraqi allegations, that we should satisfy ourselves that the control of the sale of arms in Koweit is adequate, and it will be observed that the Foreign Office nave promised that further consideration should be given to the suggestion made by Major Edmonds to this effect. The Secretary of State will therefore be glad if the Government of India will consider, in consultation with the Political Resident, whether some stricter form of control is necessary and if so what measures can be devised for the purpose. In seeking the consent oi the Sheikh to action of this nature it would be relevant to remind him of the proclamation issuedby nis predecessor in 1900 in pursuance of his undertaking to prohibit absolutely the importation of arms into Koweit or the exportation of arms therefr’om (vide Aitchison XI pp, 262 f.)k © 4 . (f 2 . 4. The representations of His Lxcellency Taufiq Snwaidi on the general question of smuggling rom ICov/eit into Iraq are discu.sed in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Foreign Office letter. The complaints of the Iraqi Government against the Sheikh on this account are of long standing* and the failure of the repeated attempts to mediate a settlement v/hich were made in the past* and particularly in 1934 and 1935* does not greatly encourage the hope of a solution being found until the blockade imposed by Saudi Arabia, - s * S. on imports from Koweit has been removed. s£#Vis aware in particular, that objection has been raised in the past to proposals, such as that of Major Edmonds* to raise the howeit tariff to the level of that of Iraq, on the grounds that it would conflict with the treaty obligation (arising from the Bunder Shweikh lease of 1907) to limit the Koweit duty on goods imported by British subjects to 4f , that it would cause discontent in Koweit through the resultant rise in prices* and that it would seriously affect legitimate trade with the interior. But the situation in which a State under the protection of* His Majesty's Government profits from smuggling goods into the territory of an ally of His Majesty's Government is patently unsatisfactory, and as the negotiations for the removal of the Saudi blockade are bound to take some further time the Secretary of State would be glad if the Government of India in consultation with the Political Resident would review the question and state whether in their opinion any measures can usefully be/'be suggested at this stage for adoption hy the Sheikh with the object of reducing the extent of smuggling from Koweit into Iraq. 5, Copies of this letter and its enclosures are being sent to the Political Resident aid the Political Agent, Koweit. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sgd.) R. REEUP.Z. 7168/38 No. E. 5705/75/91 FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 19th October, 1938 Confidential Sir I am directed by Viscount Halifax to transmit to you herewith for the consideration of the Marquess of Zetland a copy of a memorandum which the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs communicated to the United Kingdom Delegation at Geneva before his recent visit to London to serve as a basis for his discussions here with His Majesty’s Government. It will be observed that in Section 3 of this memorandum Taufiz Suwaidi raised the question of the legal status of the Sheikhdom of Koweit and made certain alternative suggestions for the solution of the problem of the smuggling and illegal arms traffic v^iich is alleged to take place from Kov/eit into Iraq; these v/ere: (a) a customs union between Iraq and Koweit; (b) the cession to Iraq of the northern part of Koweit in order to facilitate police operations; and (c) combined preventive operations. It will be seen from the enclosed copies of the records of the three conversations which Taufiz Suwaidi had in this Department that His Excellency indicated that he did not wish to insist on discussing the question of the international status of Koweit, but that he strongly urged that a further effort should be made to remove what the Iraqi Government considered as their legitimate grievances in the matter of smuggling and arms traffic from the Sheikhdom. 2. It will further be seen that Taufiq Suwaidi, while ready to accept the statement of the British authorities in the Persian Gulf that no arms are imported into Koweit by sea, maintained that there was at present nothing to Secretary of State, prevent/ India Office2 prevent the purchase of arms in Koweit and said that it ^ was common knowledge that arms traffic from Koweit into Iraq takes place on a large scale. The Iraqi Government may possibly in due course produce the evidence of this for which Taufiq Suwaidi was asked, hut it appears to Lord Halifax that in view of the positive statements on the subject made not only by Taufiq Suwaidi but also by Major Edmonds, the Adviser in the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior, who accompanied His Excellency on the second of his visits to the Foreign Office, there is every likelihood that Koweit is in fact used as a centre at v/hich arms can conveniently be bought. This is a position v/hich causes Lord Halifax some disquiet, having regard to the serious view which His Majesty’s Government have in the past always taken of their responsibility for checking the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf and to the harmful effect on security in Iraq v/hich illegal importation of arms into that country must be expected to have. His Lordship trusty therefore, that early and sympathetic consideration may be given to the suggestion, made by Major Edmonds, that the sale of arms in Koweit should be subjected to some strict form of Government control. 3. As far as other forms of smuggling are concerned, it will be seen that it was not possible to give Taufiq Suwaidi any promise of satisfaction along the lines v/hich he had suggested in his memorandum and that Major Edmonds then made a further suggestion to the effect that, since the main cause of smuggling into Iraq is the low level of the Koweiti tariff, the difficulty might be overcome if the Koweiti customs tariff were increased to the level of the Iraqi tariff. I am to add that in a subsequent conversation Major Edmonds expressed the opinion that if it proved impracticable to raise the tariff level of all goods/goods imported into Koweit, it might remove at least the main causes of friction if an increase of tariff were made on the products, such as tea, sugar, etc., which are at present smuggled in the greatest quantities. 4. Lord Halifax is of course aware that it is for the Iraqi Government in the first place to ensure that smuggling into their territory does not take place, and he has not failed to impress this fact on them, both through His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad and now in London. Nevertheless, it is impossible to deny that the consistent refusal of the Sheikh to take, or even to discuss, any practical measures to co-operate with the Iraqi Government in this matter is not consistent with the relations which normally exist between neighbouring countries. N or can it be denied that His Majesty’s Government must accept some degree of responsibility in the matter since, but for their protection of the Sheikh, the Iraqi Government would no doubt find the means of inducing him to adopt a more accommodating and friendly attitude. In view, indeed, of the special relationship of His Majesty’s Goverrment to Koweit, and of their alliance with Iraq, His Lordship regards the existing position as particularly unfortunate, since it inevitably raises doubts^n Iraq as to the extent to which it is possible to rely on the friendship of His Majesty* s Government, and their willingness to provide their ally with reasonable assistance in the protection of Iraqi interests. I am therefore to express the hope that careful consideration may be given to the possibility of taking some action on the lines suggested by Major Edmonds. If no such action proves practicable/4, practicable, Lord Halifax will be grateful for any alternative suggestions that Lord Zetland may be able to make with a view to checking smuggling from Koweit, and thus removing what the Iraqi Government undoubtedly consider to be a legitimate grievance.

In fact we think that if there was such a traffic we should have heard of it, in one way or another. Of course nobody here really knows what goes on in the interior of this country, more especially at Riyadh: for afl we know it is possible that the King, finding he has got a lot of rifles this year, has been slightly more liberal with them and has given some out to the tribes as part of the tribal subsidy.

If the Report is correct, including the M squaring M of the A.C.P.Safwan, then it confirms the opinion which I have always held (e.g. paragraph 5 of my Express Letter No.427-S, officials are hand in glove with the gun-runners. Safwan, as you are aware, is the headquarters of the Special Iraq Frontier Customs Police on the Iraqi-Kuwait frontier. There are there some 10 cars, mobile wireless outfits, and a remarkable natural feature, the Jebal Sanam, which gives observation in daylight for a considerable distance.

Extract from Persian Gulf Intelligence Report for July, 1938. 4* Kuwait Arms Smu^clinp:. With reference to paragraph 4 of the April Persian Gulf Intelligence report and paragraph 10 of the same report for May, further information has now come to hand. The situation is as follows There is no doubt that a large number of arms are finding their way into Iraq, and that these arms come from Saudi Arabia. One report states that it has been incontrovertibly proved that arms are being moved from Nejd northward. The Kuwait authorities state that there is no such smuggling from Kuwait and further that no one in Kuwait from the Shaikh downwards derives profit from a trade in arms passing through Kuwait territory. R.A.P. authorities on the other hand report four different cases of large quantities of arms and ammunition having arrived in Iraq, and in each case the source of their information stated categorically that these arras had passed through Kuwait territory. The greatest import of arms into Arabia takes place at Jedda and other places on the Red Sea coast where there is no British control of arms as in the Persian Gulf. A glance at the map makes it hard to see why these arms should come through Kuwait at all. Summing Up. (a) There is no traffic in arms from Kuwait into Iraq.. (b) There appears to be a brisk trade in arms from Saudi Arabia into Iraq.. (C)/(c) R.A.F. Authorities state that these arms pass through Kuwait territory. (d) The Political Authorities maintain that (c) is not the case. (S.N. 0.

The responsible quarter appears to be the Saudi Government, whose duty it is to stop this smuggling. In this connection I should like to emphasise the remark made at the end of paragraph 4 of my Joe press Letter quoted above, as to the number of arms imported into Saudi Arabia via the Eed sea porta. It would be interesting to know the numbers of such arms, and to what extent they axe for the legitimate use of the Saudi Govern ment. It seems to me personally that with the information which must be in their possession, as well as in yours, as to this traffic in arms from Saudi Arabia, the Iraq Government might be well advised to make a strong protest to the Saudi authorities. This however is of course a matter which is outside my sphere. 4 4. I do not understand, however, why this traffic in arms should go at all through Kuwait, except perhaps in very small quantities. A glance at the map of northern tiTaoia will show that Kuwait territory covers only a small triangle in the north-east corner. The main routes, which the gun runners must confine themselves to in order to find water, from suoh Saudi areas as those of Attl&amp;a Boreida, Hail/3 Suphratea, such as 'amawa, and the Muntafiq area# paaa well to the west of Fuwait territory. I do not see therefore why the gun runners should proceed some hundreds of miles out of their way for the purpose of passing through Kuwait territory* $• Another point which 1 do not understand is why the Iraqi authorities themselves do not take more active measures t© deal with the gun running, especially since some at least of fehe gun runners are actually Iraqi tribes men (e.g. the to Zaiyad# paragraph 3{c) of your letter, Hussainat and 'Shazai, paragraph 3( a) of your letter). The Iraqi - Saudi frontier is of course of considerable extent, but aa the gun runners approach their destination, e.g. Sam&amp;wa, they enter territory which presumably is under the control of the local Iraqi authorities. 6. I note, vide paragraph 6 of your letter, that efforts are being made to obtain the iftformatiaa asked for in paragraph 5 of my questionnaire. I quite realize however, as you point out, that this may be impossible. 7. To sum up. I a* xhere is no traffic in arms from toait into Iraq. This is precisely what the then Foreign Kiniater of Iraq stated in iiovoubei 1936, and is what I have always maintained. I trust that all concerned will now be able to accept this aa a definite fact. There appears to be a brig* trade in arms from j&amp;adi Arabia into Iraq. Ibis, aowerer, is outside my sphere. c./for Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. ru Reports received by you state that traffic under B passes through Ktawait.

Subj ect ; Alleged smuggling of arms from Kuwait into Iraq. Sir, I have the honour to reply to your letter 342-S dated 7th June, 1938, animadverting to an item in the Intelligence Summary, produced by Air Headquarters British Forces in ^Iraq, dated March, 1938 and referring to the question of the smuggling of arms into ’Iraq via Kuwait territory. 2. The reports, on which this particular paragraph was based, were received from a variety of sources, normally considered of good reliability and all in close touch with tribal affairs in the southern desert of Iraq. Hone of them suggested that the arms had originated in Kuwait, or were dealt with by Kuwaiti middlemen, but all stated categorically that these arms, presumably in ***»&gt; i&gt;nnji»«.n MfciftflfrjyiThi *w.&lt;W*J** A»WW***. transit from Sa’udi Arabia, hiad passed through Kuwait territory. 3* These reports are precised belowj- (a) Report dated 17/2/38 states that on 6/2 a caravan of Hussainat and Ghazzi tribesmen returned from Kuwait with 400 rifles. Two members of the Hussainat were arrested, and six rifles confiscated by the Iraqi police. (b) Report dated 19/3/38 states that a large consignment of rifles had been smuggled through Kuwait, and had arrived/- 2 - arrived in the Muntafiq for distribution to the Shuraifat, Budur, and Jawarin* (c) Report dated 12/4/38 states a large caravan arrived Samawa, having come through Kuwait and thence via Rukhaimiya, with a large number of rifles and other smuggled goods. The caravan was in charge of Dhafir and Az Zaiyad tribesmen; the date of its arrival at Samawa being given as 4/4/38. $d) On the same date 200 rifles with ammunition were seized by the Iraqi police near Luqait; these were likewise reported to have arrived via Kuwait. Official confirmation of this report was not obtain- ab 1 e. 4. Under existing conditions in Iraq, it will be readily understood that it is no longer possible for us to investigate the veracity of these reports through official Iraqi sources without danger of compromising our own intelligence system. Agents are interrogated in person, but there is no possible cross-check on the accuracy of their information. I n paragraph 4 of your above-quoted letter, you state that the P.A. at Kuwait admits the possibility of arms having been smuggled by Hajdis through Kuwait territory. T v7e have not exceeded this statement in the paragraph of our March Summary of Intelligence, which is now under discussion. 6 * Efforts are now being made to obtain the in formation asked for in paragraph 5 (sub-paras, (a) to (e)), but I doubt if it will be possible to do so since nothing is more difficult to keep track of than the ram ifications of the arms traffic among the tribesmencof the Southern Liwas of Iraq. 7 -/3- y @ 7 # The paragraph of the Intelligence Summary was intended to, g,nd did, emphasise the fact that arms were being imported into Iraq in very large quantities; that the tribes were re-arming; and that this constitutes a potential danger to the Iraqi government, in view of the weak administrative control in the majority of the Southern Liwas. If the reports that arms have been pass ing through Kuwait can be disproved by the responsible authorities in Kuwait, bearing in mind the known laxi ty of police control along the Kuwait - Iraq frontier, we shall be free to prosecute subsequent investigations over a much more limited area* The Samawa rifle market was reported as particularly active during the month of April, and, if the possibility of arms reaching Iraq via Kuwait is ruled out, it may be possible to trace their source of origin to either Hail or Jauf.

Since that date the Iraq Government have again occasionally brought up the accusation of arms smuggling against Kuwait, but aa usual without any evidence in support of their allegations. 4. Captain &lt;ie (r&amp;ury in his memorandum states, briefly that there Is no smuggling from Kuwait as alleged in your Intelligence summary quoted above. On tne otner n&amp;na he points out that tnere are larger numbers of Hejdi bedouin, all armed, in tne Iraq Soutnern xteaert and in the Saudi- Iraq Meutral Zone than ever before in tne memory oi man, and that it is not unliKely tnat Saudi Arabs are engaged in smuggling arms through Kuwait territory. In tnig connection Captain de Oaury’s remark (paragraph 6 of his letter) as to the number of arms imported into Arabia via the Ked Sea ports is of interest. 6.

S. Williams, Esq., Foreign Office. b5Zi j) Would you kindly refer to Foreign Office letter No.E.5490/29/91, of the 22nd September about the alleged arms smuggling incident on the Koweit- Iraq frontier? 2. We are av/aiting with interest the Resident’s report on the incident referred to, but in the meantime we should like to draw attention to Scott’s remarks regarding the statement made by Dr. Naji al Asil during his visit to Koweit last Autumn. 5. The statement made by Dr. Naji is contained in para.9 of the telegram from the Political Agent, Kov/eit, No.324 of the 10th November, 1936, (a copy of which was sent to the Foreign Office with India Office printed letter No. P.Z£744/36 of November, 1936) and expresses his conviction that recent reports of arms smuggling from Koweit were entirely erroneous. We ( *«&lt;*** J' ~nxa tL. luufL A. r , ourselves regard the s tat erne nt,|as of considerable importance as a protection against the many vague and unsupported accusations raised by the Iraqi Govt, about arms smuggling from Koweit, and we should be reluctant to accept Scott’s view that Dr. Naji’s remarks should be interpreted merely as 'an admission that 5319c 5000 10.36 reports/reports of open and active encouragement given by the Sheikh to arms smuggling were unfounded”. ^Totjjja aincf'-’, *Sgd.)reports of open and active encouragement given by the Sheikh to arms smuggling were unfounded'. &lt; 8 gd.)KOY/E IT-IRAQ ARMS SMUGGLING irwi Z? have taken a copy of this Note for Bushire files. ^ ^ Mr. V/alton . I entirely disagree with Mr. Scott 1 s reading of Nr. Naji's statement (vide para.3 of Mr. Scott’s letter of ord September). The statement made by Dr« Naji is contained in para.9 ol Political Agent, Koweit, telegram No .334 of 10th November, 1936, (p.Z.8744/36). The Mutassarif’s report is given in Ambassador, Bagdad, telegram of 7 th November, 1936 (P.Z.8534/36), and consists of a bald statement that arms smuggling from Koweit into Iraq has started again, xhis is the report (together with other reports) which Dr. Naji denies are correct. How in these circumstances Mr. Scott can read into Dr. Naji’s denial merely ”an admission that., reports of open and active encouragement given by the Sheikh to arms smuggling were unfounded” personally I do not understand. As for Mr. Scott further saying ’’doubtless if ■ Drm went any further he was not reflecting the view of the matter usually taken in Iraq” it seems to me that a definite statement by a responsible Iraqi official who at that time held the important post of Foreign Minister must have considerable more weight than the views of other individuals. Ao I have pointed out in para.3 of my letter of June 8 th (P.Z.4378/37), the Iraqi Government are continually bringing accusations against Koweit of arms traffic without ]r oducing any proof, and I regard Dr. Naji’s statement as of considerable importance as a protection against such vague accusations. I deprecate very strongly any attempt to whittle Dr. Naji’s statement away, and, if you agree, I suggest that the F.O. might be informed that the 1.0. do not agree/'I agree with Mr. Scott’s views on this point. 2. With regard to the particular arms smuggling incident reported in Mr. Scott’s letter already .{noted, I agree that we might await the result of local investigation. I may point out, however, that the Iraqi report of the incident is, as usual, unsatisfactory. The incident is alleged to have taken place on the 15th July, and their report is dated 31st August, i.e. six weeks later. Neither the names of the two Bedouins or their tribes are given, nor is it stated whether they are Iraqi or Koweiti subjects. The make of the two rifles is also omitted. Before forwarding the Iraqi complaint I think the Embassy might have approached the Iraq authorities for these further details. However, doubtless Mr. Caroe will ask for them.r Jn any further communication on this subject, please quote fWfo / i-f / ^/. and address— ia^any person by name, but tq— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.i i \ z 6295 V I o THE Under-Secretary of Sta^e for Eoreigjx.^Affairs presents his compliments to r anc ^ b y direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith copy^ of the under-mentioned paper. % i Foreign Office, 193 Reference to previous correspondence : Description of Enclosure.

Minister for Foreign Affairs is again raising the question of our refusal to serve on the Shaikh of Koweit documents concerning actions brought against him in respect of properties now in his possession in Basra (I have little doubt that these are the old Faddaghiyah cases, see paragraph 1 of my despatch No.70 of February 8 th, 1936). 2 . I have replied orally that best way to deal with matter and to safeguard all rights is to adopt land settlement procedure set out in Bateman's letter No.347 of July 8 th, 1936. 3. Minister for Foreign Affairs retorts that he has no hope of being able to persuade the Prime Minister to agree to these proposals so long as the Shaikh of Koweit refuses to take effective measures to stop smuggling. (There is fresh irritation on this point as Iraqi Government] strongly suspect that rifles are being sent from Koweit to Euphrates tribes). 4 . If I now take the line indicated in your despatch No.262 of April 27th 1936, Iraqi Government will probably reply by amending law in such a manner as to provide a legal method of proceeding with cases without service of documents or by substituted service. I need not enlarge on difficulties to which this would give rise. On the other hand, if His Majesty's Government oppose such action&gt; 2 . by the Iraqi Government an embarrassing state of friction may arise. Key to problem appears to lie in reasonable action by the Shaikh to stop smuggling. It seems clear that it is within his power to do this, but that he will not use his power until forced to do so.

If i were now to ask for a letter, I fear he would qualify his absolution of the bhaikh in regard to arms smuggling with strictures on the Bhaikh*s encouragement of smuggling of other kinds and, as you Know, I go not want to have that question raised again formally until I am able to suggest remedial measures. Moreover, as you will have seen from my telegram No.22 ol November 7th, the Iraqi Govern ment only brought the Mutasarriff 1 s report to my notice orally ano 1 feel that, as they have so readily accepted the bhaikh*s explanations, it would be a little discourteous to press for a * climb down* in writing.

This morning however he said that after a disoussia. with the shaikh ho was convinced the Mutaaarrif’s report am other reports about arms smuggling were entirely erroneous and as soon as he reached Riyadh he would telegraph to Baghdad to say so and that the Huler had said he was quite willing to re-emphasize by public notice his forbidt ance of arras export which was most satisfactory and would make the Cabinet happy. 10. The kiaieter who left today is due in Kuwait about the 19th Horember but dare not owing to home politics, wait for the Hon’ble the Resident due on the 24th. XI. I cm loft with tho Impression that all he requires is sorasthing accomplished here to go back with to Baghdad and if he has something to show then the recent wilder ©causations which policy may have dictated but facts do not support may be abandoned and relations improved. 12. for this X suggest (a) ublic notice by the shaikh forbidding export of arms to which BhaIkh appears to have agreed eiready and i a nothing new but may sound well in Baghdad. This might be followed up cither now or later by lb] adopting a hopeful attitude about oreign . inister’s suggestion given in para 7.

ProdromeTelegram From Politicsil Resident, Bushire From To Ambassador, Bagdad Repeated Political Agent, Kuwait, }Jo. 801. Bated the 8th November 1936. Important . Your telegram of 7th November to Political Agent, Kuwait. I have no objection to Minister for Foreign Affairs speaking to Political Agent, Kuwait, but latter will naturally bear in mind that as Resident it is I who have the final responsibility (under His Majesty’s Government) for Kuwait affairs and will therefore be careful before committing him self in the course of conversation. 2. Iraq Government in my opinion are far too fond of making vague and hitherto entirely unfounded accusations against Kuwait of gun-running and I venture to suggest that they might be asked to stop this objectionable practice* Any case for which they can produce evidence will of course be thoroughly sifted. -Britcons ul.'J+09/36 Extract from letter from British Embassy to G-.Rendel Esq.., C.M.O. , dated 20th May, 1936 No.E.3233/38/91- K yc * As regards the smuggling of arms, I said that I should he glad to receive details of any positive instances which had come to light. His Majesty’s G-overnment, who had themselves been obliged to do so much to stop the smuggling of arms from the Gull' into India, would certainly understand the importance of this matter and it might well be easier to devise effective measures to stop illicit traffic in arms than to prevent smuggling in tea, matches, sugar and so on. The Prime Minister thanked me and said that he would give instructions for the facts to be clarified in a special report. He remarked, however, that as the arms were passed on through the tribes, it was very difficult to establish proof. Incidentally, there have been of late one or two very foolish articles about Koweit in a piffling little Iraqi newspaper called 'Al Karkh”. I send you two specimens. I am bringing them to the notice of Yassin. I am sending a copy of this letter to Bushire and Koweit.
