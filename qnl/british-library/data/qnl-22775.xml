As soon as an Indian medical Service Officer in civil employ dies at one of sucri places, steps should be taken to inform t^e nearest military station coi.manuer as well as the Defence Department of the Government of India. The former wrk' appoint a formal Committee of adjustment.

All these forms should be sent to the Committee for necessary action as described at the end of the preceding paragraph, d. If the estate is insolvent , the person concerned should be advised not to take it ever under Section 5 of the Regimental Debts Act. In such cases, steps should be taken tc prepare an inventory'of the property, a list of all debts against the estate and a statement cf assets. The widow, or the next-of-kin, if present at the station, should net be allowed to remove the personal property of the deceased officer except articles of sentimental value. No debts should be paid by you. The documents referred to in paragraph 3 above should be forwarded as soon as possible to the CommiVU who will take all further necessary action in the master.

The Jranian visas are valid for three months from the date of issue and I presume Dr. Holmes wants to stay in India only for a week or two. lie will return in ample time for these visas. I think Dr. Holmes has not applied for the statement of .eave due, but he can do so now and explain to A.G.C.R. that |in view of the urgency of the case he could not apply earlier. hay show the telegram to Dr. Holmes and ask him how long he would be away. sf&amp;L+pt, Seen by Dr. Holmes. 7/^ , Dr.Holmes is enquiring about a passage by air to India and will let us know the dates. For the present he ays if the visas allow he may stay one month. tAJ] ^ /2 L ^ /L- ^ ^ ■- 1. Dr. Holmes' relief; Dr. Steele has arrived. Dr. Holmes presumably will leave by next boat which may be after about a fornight. His passport is still with the Government of India for an Iranian Visa. We have reminded them telegraphically to send the passport by air mail as early as possible. 2. Total subscriptions to Dr. Holmes' send-off fund amount to Rs.330/- and the list of the persons who have contributed is given at page 1,2 and 3 of the register submitted below. 3. The present from Mappin and Webb has arrived and is sent herewith. The parcel from Army &amp; Navy, for a travelling clock for Mrs. Holmes could not possibly arrive by the last up boat as our last telegram ordering the clock must have reached them after the boat's departure from Bombay.

Manamah patients will have to go to the Mission hospital or the Bahrain Government dispensary. it is a pity to have to close the Victoria Memorial surgery but I do not consider that the attendenoe to this surgery is sufficient cause for cancelling Dr. Steele's leave.
