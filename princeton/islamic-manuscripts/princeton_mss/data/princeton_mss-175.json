Title supplied by cataloger. 15 lines per page. Written in medium small naskh in black ink. Dark cream paper with laid lines visible. Interlinear and marginal notes. Impression of a stamp on fol. 4a, 147a. Foliation in pencil using Western numerals (counting the two first fly-leaves as fol. 1 and 2). This record is in accordance with this foliation. According to the colophons, this is an autograph, dated 1025 H. (fol. 73b) and 1020 H. (fol. 77b). The dates appearing in the colophons are however more likely the date of completion of the texts (see note on the author on fol. 78a, which seems to be by the same hand as the rest of the text). The eulogy on some marginal notes on the ʻUyūn al-masāʼil (\"minhu dāma ẓilluh\") seems to indicate that the author was still living at the time of copy.", "author": "Dāmād, Muḥammad Bāqir ibn Muḥammad, d. 1631?", "abstract": "Collection of texts by Mīr Dāmād.", "contents": "6. fol. 147b-151b: [Several short texts and excerpts].", "extent": "149 leaves : paper ; 192 x 128 (125 x 72) mm. bound to 193 x 132 mm.", "identifier": "http://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/db78tc074", "alternate_identifier": "http://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/db78tc074", "replaces": "pudl0032/ns232", "title": "Shirʻat al-tasmiyah fī zamān al-ghaybah ...
