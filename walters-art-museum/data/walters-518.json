This fine statuette of the goddess shows her seated on a throne that is now lost. Inlays of gold and pigment show the details of her bead-net dress, necklace, armlets and bracelets. On her head she wears the Red Crown of Lower Egypt, adorned on the back with a falcon that grasps a shen-ring, a sign of protection, in each of its talons. A falcon is also depicted on the goddess' back, wrapping its wings around her body in a protective embrace. Although Neith was worshipped throughout ancient Egyptian history, statues of her like this one were particularly popular during the 26th Dynasty when the ruling kings made Sais, her cult center, the country's capital.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1912", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/28580", "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1912, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "26th Dynasty", "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2013-11-05T01:00:01.513", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.2111_Fnt_DD_T12.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.2111_Fnt_DD_T12.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.2111_Fnt_DD_T12.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.2111_Fnt_DD_T12.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.2111_Fnt_DD_T12.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "3193", "Images": "PS1_54.2111_3QtrLft_DD_T12.jpg, PS1_54.2111_3QtrRt_DD_T12.jpg, PS1_54.2111_Back_DD_T12.jpg, PS1_54.2111_Fnt_DD_T12.jpg, PS1_54.2111_Lft_DD_T12.jpg, PS1_54.2111_Rt_DD_T12.jpg, PS1_54.2111_VwA_DD_T12.jpg, PS1_54.2111_VwB_DD_T12.jpg, PS1_54.2111_VwC_DD_T12.j", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
