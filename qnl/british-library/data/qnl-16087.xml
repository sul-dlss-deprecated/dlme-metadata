It encloses copies of three letters from Willock to Mirza Sheffi and translations of a letter and a firman:Letter, dated 31 January 1816, describing an incident at Bushire where Nasr Ollah Khan [Nasrullah Khan], governor of Bushire, seized cargo belonging to a British merchant ship. The cargo was eventually returned, but Willock suspects that Nasr Ollah Khan had orders from his superiors to act in this way against the British and calls strongly for his punishment.Letter, dated 4 February 1816, describing an incident where a ship transporting horses for the East India Company was made to anchor again by Nasr Ollah Khan and its crew requisitioned by him. In addition, Mirza Eusuph, Vizier of Hussein Ali Mirza, intercepted Bruce's messengers. Willock warns of the consequences these actions against the East India Company may have.Letter, dated 6 March 1816, expressing Willock's dismay at the above actions having gone unpunished and no reparation having been offered. He informs Mirza Sheffi that he will have to report the matter to the British ministers, which would hurt Persia's relationship with Great Britain.Translation of a letter from Mirza Sheffi to Henry Willock, undated, informing him that Nasr Ollah Khan has been recalled to answer for his actions.Translation of a firmaun from [His Persian Majesty] to Hussain Ali Mirza, undated, expressing his displeasure with the events in Bushire and ordering that the British Resident be treated with respect.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024052105.0x000040#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
