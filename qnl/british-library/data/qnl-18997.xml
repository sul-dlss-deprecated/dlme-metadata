Anderson writes that the Government approves of Kemball’s proceedings in the matter to date. Anderson also encloses an extract of paragraph forty-one of a despatch from the Honourable Court of Directors of 27 April 1854 (folio 11), in which it is made clear that Humeed bin Mujdell’s previous crimes, including enslavement and murder, which were committed while ‘in the service of the Shaikh of Bahrain’ have not been addressed with sufficient weight by the Government. Anderson comments in his own letter that Kemball’s use of the term ‘irregularities’ to describe Humeed bin Mujdell‘s actions is too mild.Also included with Anderson’s letter is a copy of letter no.3407 of 1854 (folio 12) from Anderson to Rear Admiral Henry Leeke, Commander in Chief of the Indian Navy, dated 2 August 1854. The letter, sent to Kemball for reference, is a request for information about how soon the Persian Gulf squadron can be reinforced, in light of Humeed bin Mujdell’s actions.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051557.0x000004#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
