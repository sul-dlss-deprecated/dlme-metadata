The Bahrain islands in the Persian Gulf, which have recently become an important oil centre, have for many years been of great interest to archaeologists owing to the existence of a vast necropolis of burial mounds or tumuli which occupy the centre of the largest of the islands. The tumuli cover an area of about 16 square miles, the largest mounds are over 40 feet high and the smallest are about 4 feet high. They have been excavated by different people at various times, by Dr. Bent in 1889, by Colonel Prideaux in 1906 - 07 and by Mr. E. Mackay in 1924. During these excavations few if any perfect pieces of pottery or other articles were found and it appeared that most of the larger tombs had been rifled. The origin of the people who are buried in this enormous cemetery still remains one of the most interesting archaeological riddles in the Near East. In addition to the main group there are many isolated clusters of tumuli in Bahrain especially on the south west coast of the island. Last month, while the Bahrain Government was construct ing a new road from j&amp;anamah, the capital, to Budeya, a village on the coast, it was found necessary to demolish several mounds in a small group of tumuli. When the mounds were cut through it was found that each one contained several stone burial chambersI i chambers which had evidently never been opened or rifled. Inside the chambers were skeletons in a state of perfect preservation, unbroken vases and glazed pottery, a black stone vessel apparently used as a swinging lamp, an alabaster dish and various other metal and glass objects. In one tomb two large earthenware jars were found contain ing human bones and round the base of the largest tomb, which has not yet been excavated, there was a wall four feet high of large cut stones forming a perfect circle with a circumference of about 100 feet. The nature of the pottery indicates that it is most probably Phoenician and if this proves to be the case it will establish the fact, which until now has been doubtful, that the Phoenicians frequented the Persial Gulf. Only three or four tombs have been opened and as each one contained unrifled burial chambers it is probable that more discoveries will be made in the twenty or thirty tombs belonging to this group which are still untouched. The Bahrain Government has taken steps to ensure that the remaining tumuli shall not be interfered with until proper investigations can be made.Office of the Political ! ? «ai&lt;i«Dt In the P«ra ian Oulf # Oarny, Bahrain.

The most important of them are the group of large mounds at Aali. A few days ago when I went to Aali I was amazed to see that an elaborate stone crushing machine and various other apparatus had been set up on one of the large tombs and a shed had been put up near the tomb where a Persian watchman was stationed. I understood from him that work was being done for or by the Royal Air Force but as he spoke no Arabic it was difficult to understand. In the past stone has been taken from the tombs on Rafaa hill, in this neighbourhood there are 15 square miles of tombs and there is no objection to the stones on these tombs being removed - thefe are plenty to spare, but the Aali group is of a different category and I consider it is most improper that they should be interferred with by people who have no knowledge or appreciation of their interest or importance. If the R.A.F. or anyone else require stone they can take it from the Rafaa hill but the Aali tombs should not be disturbed. I I should be grateful if you could draw the atten tion of the R.A.F. authorities to this matter and suggest that they remove their equipment to the Rafaa area. Major T.
