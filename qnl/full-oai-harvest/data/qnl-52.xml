However, the date of the first letter may be incorrect and should perhaps be 7 March 1820 instead (see the entry for IOR/R/15/1/23, f 1-7 for further information). Some letters are also slightly out of date order, so chronological order is not strict.</extent><extent>Foliation: The main foliation sequence starts with the first page of text and runs through to the last folio. It is written in pencil and can be found in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio. This sequence has been used to construct the references at item level, and for internal referencing.Pagination: A pagination system is also present, which runs folios 22-275, though there are gaps in the sequence; these numbers are also written in pencil and can be found in the same position as the main sequence.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume consists of correspondence primarily between Francis Warden, Chief Secretary to the Bombay Government, and Captain Thomas Perronet Thompson.
