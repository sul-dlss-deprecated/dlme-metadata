Memorandum: - One Khuda Bakhsh Khan, a Punjabi Moslem from Lahore, has recently resigned from the Electric Department of his own accord having completed three terms of Agreement. He has been paid-all his dues except a return deck passage with food to India amounting to Rs. 129/-. He was enlisted in India and should normally return to India on the completion of his Agreement. I think it is undesirable that this man should remain hanging about in Bahrain as I have reason to believe that he is trying to persuade certain Indian employees of the Bahrain Government to resign their posts and to seek work elsewhere. The matter is complicated by the fact that during his service here he married a Bahrain subject, of the Zayani family, the condition that she should not be compelled to go to India. The wife is a grand ■ -daughter of the late Haj Sager Zayani who was for many years a clerk in the Adviserate, Khuda Bakhsh now informs me that he wishes to go to Saudi-Arabia where he expects to find lucrative employment and his wife's family are willing that his wife should go with him. As I think it is not unlikely that this man will later on apply for assistance to return to India, in which case he would become financially responsible to his wife, I would liice to deposit with you the r remaining balance of money to which he is entitled so that.his repatriation 4 * become necessary it will not be a charge on public funds. If he leaves Bahrain and settles in the Hejaz, which is his apparent intention / the Bahrain Government has no objec- tion though it does not wish him to remain in Bahrain. adviser to the QOVERNMlNT.No.1650-13/4 Political Agency,Bahrain. 1st September,1942.
