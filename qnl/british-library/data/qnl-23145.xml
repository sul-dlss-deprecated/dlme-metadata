He is young and quite intelligent and has already done a nine months 1 course of military training with the training battalion at Karachi and was well reported on by the Officer Commanding. I should like him to have an opportunity of learning something of the methods of inves tigation and general police work so that per haps in the future he could take on that side of the work which his father used to do. I should be much obliged if you could suggest where he could be sent to learn and what steps should be taken. I should think he could learn a good deal in one year. Yours sincerely, ^ - Lieut.

Unless the subse- -quent demand is endorsed making a reference to the telegraphic demand there is a possibility that both will be treated as indents and complied ®itn. ’.Then it is realised that hundreds of indents may be received between the submission of the original and the receipt of the duplicate copy or second copy of the demand, it will be seen that it is a simple master for the second copy of a demand to be complied with on the assumption that it is the original. Similarly in certain cases demands are sent to Army - iiec.dquarters, and/or to Military Advisers for countersignature with the result that more than one copy of the demand arrives in Arsenal at varying intervals for compliance. In the case of payment issues considerable ^convenience is caused to all concerned by the necessary financial odjust- -ments which have to be carried out due to the return of unwanted stores after a duplication of issues has occurred. Equipment Regulations India ft.I 1953 para 47(1) governs the submission of indents and states that indents will be submitted in original only. Similar instructions are also printed on the cover of indent pads. It is realised that non-regular units may not be in possession of Equipment Regulations or the proper indent toms on which to submit demands, a copy of the indent fom I.^P.2 2008 will be gladly sent t0 fny unit desiring it on application and manuscript copies of it can then bo made out for submission as indents. In cases whore more than one co,y of an indent oror demrncl for stores is mode out, eoch copy should show how the other copies hove been disposed of. By this means, it will be possible for all concerned to know that other copies are in circulation and duplicate issues through lack of connection.will be avoided. Cases sometimes occur in which copies of indents which require the sanction of the Military Adviser^ or other authorities are sent to Arsenal for compliance in anticipation of sanction being accorded on the other copy. It is pointed out that such sanction can only be anticipa ted in extreme cases and that considerable responsibility devolves on the Arsenal who also have to anticipate sanction if stores are o despatched pmop/its being accorded on the other copy of the indent. It would be appreciated if the difficulties and suggestions for their removal couln be brought to the notice of all concerned and it is hoped that the suggestions in the foregoing paragraphs regarding the procedure for demanding stores will prove helpful...
