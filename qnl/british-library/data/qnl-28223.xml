He preferred to leave the punishment unspecified as for religeous reasons certain punishments might be unsuitable for certain offences. In fact he proposed to inform his subjects of his intention make use of his unlimited powers in the furtherance of the common object of Great Britain, and Muscat and Oman.

Dear Peel, Your letter P.Z.6117/39 and 5988/39 of October 11th and 12th. are Persian Gulf Regulations. As regards the former, I concur. As regards the latter, I should be Quite happy to the points you mention in paragraph 2 ignored if you satisfied that they are of no practical consequence.

Dear Peel, I am sorry that owing to pressure of work I have not been able to reply before to your secret letter of the 17th August (P.Z.4794/39) about the draft Trading with the Enemy Regulations to be promulgated in the Persian Gulf. Subject to one doubtful point, I agree that the draft enclosed with your letter appears to be in order. jC f The doubtful point is this. I think that, as the draft stands, Board of Trade Order made under Section 2(2) of the Act ^viz. an Order directing that the persons specified therein shall, while so specified, be deemed to be enemies) will take effect in the Persian Gulf on the same date as in this country (which will be, in practice, the date when the Order is published). There will then be a time lag before the names can be published in the Buwmmm Gulf, and in the meantime traders in the Gulf may unwittingly have transacted business with persons named in the Order and thereby committed a criminal offence. Do you think the /Political R. Peel, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S. W.l.r* r { I Political Resident should be asked to issudLa. Regulation to the effect that no Order made under Section 2(2) shall take effect in the Persian o-ulf until the M names of the specified persons' have been published locally? My own view is that in it will probably be impossible to publish '&amp;&amp;) the names simultaneously throughout the length of the Gulf, and that we had better let the Regulations stand as drafted and turn a blind-eye on any offences committed through unavoidable ignorance; but I doubt whether this view would commend itself to our legal colleagues. I am sending a copy of this letter to Pitzmaurice.y &lt;*' Draft Trading with the Enemy Peculation s. DOTICE .

For 'Section 13' in the Third Recital you should now substitute 'Section 14'. (2) Draft Regulations. (i) I see that in paragraph 2(a) you use the expression 'imprisonment of either description ' but in subsequent paragraphs iu say 'imprisonment' tout court . Should not the same xpression be used throughout? (ii) Paragraph 2(d). I do not think it would be proper to est in the Political Resident the power to make orders, under election 2(2) of the Bill, directing that the persons /in neutral countries/ named therein should be 'deemed' to be enemies. These orders raise very delicate issues, and the list of persons 'deemed' to be enemies (commonly known as the statutory list) j.P. Gibson, Esq. /shouldt r \ r ~ ~ ? chao a- should be the same in the Gulf States as it is in the United Kingdom. (iii) For much the same reasons you should, I think, omit your paragraph lettered 2(1), which would empower the Political Resident to declare specified notes and coins to be 'enemy currency'. As requested, I am enclosing herewith two more copies of the draft Bill. I am sending a copy of this letter to McCombe, sincerely, YounSECRET. Trading with the Enemy Bill. ARRANGEMENT OF CLAUSES.

S.W.l. 22nd June, 1939, In Beckett’s absence I am replying to your secret letter P.Z. 2644/39 of June 14th, enclosing draft Trading with the Enemy Regulations for the Persian Gulf. I agree that Section 5 should be omitted. V - . subject to the views of the Board of Trade and Treasury, to whom, no doubt, you will be submitting the Regulations. I agree also that what you refer to as Section 10(2) should be retained as modified. Incidentally, should not the reference be to Section 11(2)? The wrong number seems to be due to the fact that Section 9 of the Trading with the Enemy Bill has been disregarded, since I see that there is no comment on/ R.T.Peel, Esq.., M.G., India Office.on that section The words 'on summary conviction' '11 (2)', and the references to subsequent sections altered accordingly. As regards 2 (a) of the draft regulations I do not understand the reference to 'imprisonment of either description', unless this is a term well understood in Indian law as applied to the Persian Gulf States. It might be advisable to elaborate this. Finally, I agree that questions of bail and cognis- ability may be left to the Resident. There seems to be no need to say anything in the Regulations on these points provided that 'bailability' and 'cognisability' depend on general principles - e.g. the amount of punishment that can be inflicted for an offence so that it will be clear by implication whether e.g. a given offence under the regulations is one for which bail can be granted or not.hrj trj Secret* P.Z. 2644/39 INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.\/.l.

With reference to 3(k), Sir Kenneth Kemp comments:- ‘’Secticn 5 as it stands appears co apply solely U.K. securities etc. In view of the fact that no companies are, or are likely to he, registered in tne Territories and no such securities as are descrihed in subsection (4) exist therein, any adaptation of the section would seem to hear no relation to existing conditions. The section might accordingly, I think, he omitted. '* 3. As regards 3(u) he says he would he inclined to omit Section 10(2) altogether. But is not our suggested amendment desirable in order to remove any douht about the Political Resident’s power of delegation to the Political Agents? • Beckett, uscp , C.iu.G. , oreign Office, S.YM.7 4. The Legal Adviser adds that questions as to hail and as to which of the offences should he cognisable and which non-cognis,able might be left for the comment of the Political Resident.
