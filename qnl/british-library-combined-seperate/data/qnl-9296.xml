The British Government did not want to encourage the development of a Saudi Arabian port (folio 73), because of the adverse economic impact it would have on Bahrain (folio 63).The papers include: a request from the Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company (CASOC) for an Admiralty survey of the coast of Arabia, including minutes of a meeting between the Admiralty, the India Office, and the Company (folios 52-59); the conclusion of an agreement between the Government of Saudi Arabia and Gray Mackenzie &amp; Company Limited to act as landing agents at Ras Tanurah, including correspondence from Sir Reader William Bullard, HM Minister, Jeddah; and consideration by the Government of India in 1940 whether trade with Saudi Arabia should be diverted to Ras Tanurah, with comments by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.The main date range of the papers is 1936-40; there is only one item of correspondence dated 1945.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Gray, Mackenzie and Company Limited, shipping agents</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Ras Tanura</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Harbours</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001bc#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001bc#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001bc#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
