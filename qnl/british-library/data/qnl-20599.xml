My dear Starling, Ballantyne of the Bahrein Petroleum Company enquired the other day whether His Majesty's Government would have any objection to their marketing people, the California Texas Company, applying to the Australian and New Zealand Governments for preference for Bahrein oil * He asked at the same time whether there would 'be any objection to preference being asked in otner British possessions, (including India). The reason for the enquiry was that the marketing people said tiiey thought they could secure 'preference from the Australian Government but the i^amein Petroleum Company (or rather the parent Company- standard Oil of California) are anxious not to do anything whicn mi gib t in any way embarrass His Majesty's Government, and are therefore not disposed to accept the suggestion of their marketing people unless they are assured that His ^ajeot^ s Government would not have any objection. The first question seems to be - do His Majesty's Government object in principle to the Bahrein letroleum tarling,Esq., asking/ etroleum Department, Mines Department, Dean 'St anliey St., S .W . 1.1/ asking for preferences in the British Empire which, if obtained, would put thera in a better position for competing with e.g. the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company? If so, can we tell Ballantyne this? Alternatively, should we say to hira that His Majesty's Government are opposed in principle to oil preferences, that there is no Imperial preference for oil in this country or in the British Empire generally, and that in these circumstances His Majesty's Government would deprecate the Bahrein Company raising the matter with a Dominion Government? If His Majesty's Government have no objection in vyrinciple , there seem to 03 two aXcernB ci v e ansvvei s that we might make to Ballantyne-:- (1) tell him to let his people go ahead and that we should be interested to know whether they are successful. (2) to say that we have no objection to application being made to the Australian Government but that if so, His Majesty's Government would do their best to ensure that any preference granted to Bahrein is granted also to all Colonial oil products.3. I should be glad if you would kindly let me know as soon as possible what your views are as to the answer to be given. I understand from conversation with Coleman that in point of fact there is not at present any Imperial preference in respect of oil granted by the Australian Government (with one small exception) and if we can say this ox the British Empire as a whole we should, of course, have good ground for deprecating the action proposed by the Bahrein Company if in fact His Majesty's Government do not like the idea of possible reactions on the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. I am sending copies of this letter to Brenan at the Foreign Office,, Bankes-Amery at the Dominions Office, Eastwood at the Colonial Office and Seal at the Admiralty. Yours sincerely, (Sd.)

Would you kindly refer to your letter of the 30tli April and our conversation about that time in wincn vou asked for the views of His Majesty's Government on the suggestion that the Australian Government might 'be asked to grant an Trn^firial ^or ef erence on P ro d ':!£ ts ' This question has necessitated various consultations and I am. sorry not to have 'been able to give you an earlier re ply. 2. The reply is that the quantity of oil produced in the 'Eknpire is small and that the seeking or granting of preference on oil products generally has not been the policy of His Majesty's Government. T he d isadvantages which might s.rise from any cnange of policy e likely to 'be greater than the advantages. For these reasons His Majesty's Government, so far as they are concerned, woald prefer that the question should not be pursued by trie C ompany. 3» The above is, of course, for your confidential information.

Dean Stanley St., Milibank, London,S.¥.1 No. P. D. 21 /4. 12th June,1937 I i ^y dear Glaus on With, reference to your letter of 18th May on the subject of the preferential rates of duty in Australia and New Zealand for Bahrein oils, while I think it is unlikely that either of these two countries would accede to the request of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, I do not think we should allow the matter to be put to the test. As you know, there is no preference in the United Kingdom for Empire oils. Trinidad have applied for a preference on motor spirit on a number of occasions in recent years, but have been turned down. Umpire production (apart from Bahrein) is very small and is confined to Trinidad, Sarawak and Brunei, Burmah and India. Burmah production is absorbed in India, Trinidad oil enjoys a preference in some of the West Indian Islands, but that is largely a local arrangement. It also enjoys a preference in Sierra Leone, but the quantity of oil involved is almost negligible. The only cases in which we have endeavoured to obtain preference have been in respect of lubricating oils manufactured in this country. This is a rather specialised trade faced with stiff American competition, the American sources of supply being very much nearer to both the West Indies and the Australasian markets. Over a period of years we have managed to secure a few improvements in the qualifying conditions in both places. lauson Esq., Any/ dia Office, Whitehall,S .W .I.T) 1 2. Any general extension of preierence to motor spirit, fuel oil 5 etc., would not in practice benefit Empire producers. On the other hand, the grant of a preference to Bahrein oil would, in certain countries, notably Australia, enable the Bahrein Company to compete on favourable terms with existing British interests marketing oil not of Empire origin. This question arose in July last, when the marketing arrangements with the Texas Company were under discussion. On that occasion I mentioned that there were certain advantages from the point of view of our big oil groups in a Company like the Texas handling the oil, since it will then flow into the channels where they normally trade, and thus there would be a minimum of disturbance of markets, which is all to the good from the point of view of British oil interests. (See my P Li b.!&gt; v letter of 3rd JulF, 1936, I.0.ref.P.Z.4298/36.) But if the Bahrein-Texas Company is going to get a preference in certain markets, it cannot but prejudice the interests of the Anglo- Iranian and Shell Companies, To take the case of Australia, I enclose a statement showing the imports of petroleum products in the year 1954/5, from which you will see that the bulk of the imports are obtained from Dutch East Indies and Persia, the Shell Group and the Anglo-Iranian being the principal companies concerned. The latter Company operate through the Commonwealth Oil Refineries,Limited, one half of whose capital is held by the Commonwealth Government. I suggest, therefore, that it should be pointed out to Ballantyne in general terms that the quantity of oil produced in the Empire is small, and that the seeking or granting of preferences on oil products generally has not been the policy of H.H.Government. The disadvantages which might/might arise irom any change of policy are likely to 'be greater than the advantages. For these reasons, therefore, H.M,Government would prefer that the matter were not pursued. On the question of assurances to be given in regard to the control of the Bahrein Petroleum Company (your letter ^c^n P.Z.2544/37 of 28th April), I am inclined to think that the proposal to exchange letters would be the best way 01 dealing with the matter, providing, as Seal suggests in his fxt- letter of 25th May, that it is made clear that any proposal regarding the transfer of control to other interests will be notified well in advance to H.M.Government. I am sending copies of this letter to Brenan, Bankes- Arnery, Clauson and Seal. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) IT. C. Starling.; I'V The present depth of this discovery well - No. 52—is 4,535 ft,, and it has been continued through the new producing zone from 4,150 ft., slightly less oil and gas being found in the lower part of the section. Very high pressures were »met during the testing stages. \ Because the gas is wet, further quantities would make it economical to erect a natural-gasoline plant for the production of blending spirit. The discovery well in the upper zone came in during June, 1932, at a depth of 2,008 ft., and to date 11,000 acres have proved productive, there being '50 wells with 3,000 ft. spacing.

AH indications are (says the 'Petroleum Times') that another large commercial horizon exists underneath, and the first well drilled on a drill stem test produced 250 barrels per day of 60 to 65 A.P .I. gravity crude, mostly con densate, and about 18,000,000 by the latest find. Up to the middle of October twelve million barrels of crude had been produced. Up to the present time only about £4,000,000 has been spent, yet the company possesses what may be considered one of the most profitable oilfields of its size in the Old World, complete with a modern cubic ft. of saturated gas at 1,900 i refinery and pipeline to deep water. to 2,000 lb. pressure. This oil, of course, being I almost gasoline,' is far more valu able than any yet found in the Near or Middle East, and if further drilling proves that there is a large field, it means that the present strategic position of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Ltd. (Standard of California and Texas Company) is further strengthened. It will place this group in an unassailable competitive situation in the event of any oil war in the markets East of Suez. The company's 25,000 barrel per day refinery will be placed on full stream this month, and part has been in operation for some time past. British workmen and engineers are beipg employed as far as possible on the refinery and other operations, and young technical students are being sent to Bahrein and trained. Some 200 permanent British employees have been sent since January, .1936, as well as approximately 300 British work men, in connection with the refinery erection. There aire opportunities for rapid advance ment for employees of the right j type.

FOR the purposes of this summary the Arabian Peninsula may be said to lie south of a line joining Aqaba at the northern end of the Red Sea to Koweit at the northern end of the Persian Gulf. Included in this area are the following States, sheikhdoms or territories, in most of which petroleum concessions have been, or are likely to be, obtained :— (A) Under British sovereignty or protection— Koweit. Bahrein. Qatar. Trucial Sheikhdoms— Ajman. Abu Dhabi. Debai. Ras-al-Khaimah. Sharjah. Umm-al-Quwaim. Aden Colony. Aden Protectorate. (B) Independent States— Saudi Arabia— (i) Red Sea Area. (ii) Nejd— {d) Hasa. (b) Remainder of Nejd. The Yemen. Muscat and Oman.Q (C) Miscellaneous— Koweit Neutral Zone. Petroleum Concessions {Limited). 2. As Petroleum Concessions (Limited) are interested in the majority of the above-mentioned territories it has been thought worth while to include in this summary a short note on the genesis and composition of the company. 3. The company, which was first registered in October 1935, is a subsidiary of the Iraq Petroleum Company, and the change of name was decided upon in order to facilitate the securing of concessions outside Iraq. The whole of the shares in Petroleum Concessions (Limited) are held by the same interests and in the same proportions as obtain in the Iraq Petroleum Company, and the boards of the two companies are similarly composed, except that the Board of Petroleum His Majesty 's Government exercise by custom only a considerable degree of influence over the affairs of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. 9918 [330 1—1] Bi;.

S. Gulbenkian ... 23-75 23-75 23-75 23-75 5-00 100-00 Koweit. 4. The concession for this territory is held by the Koweit Oil Company (Commercial Agreement, dated the 23rd December, 1934; Political Agreement,( 2 ) dated the 5th March, 1934), the capital of which is held jointly by the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company and the Gulf Oil Corporation of America (Mellon Group), 5. One well was put down on the north side of Koweit Bay, but only small quantities of oil were found. Another well has been drilled at Bur^an, south of Koweit Bay, and was successful in striking oil.

Negotiations in respect of the area belonging to the Sheikh of Bahrein,, but not allotted to the Bahrein Petroleum Company in their lease, have been carried on between the sheikh on the one hand and both Petroleum Concessions (Limited) and the Bahrein Petroleum Company, on the other, but so far without definite result. ^ 10. The Bahrein Petroleum Company was incorporated in Canada in 1929, the whole of the share capital being subscribed by the Standard Oil Company of 2375 California. In 1936 an agreement was reached between the Standard Oil Company and the Texas Corporation, whereby the latter company obtained a half ^ - interest in the Bahrein Petroleum Company/ As the Texas Oil Corporation has markets in various Eastern countries, this arrangement secures an outlet for the refined products obtained from the refinery recently erected in Bahrein. Qatar. 11. The oil rights in this territory were originally granted to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company on the 17th May, 1935. A political agreement was entered into on the 5th June, 1935. The agreement, which runs for a term of seventy-five years, was transferred to Petroleum Development (Qatar) (Limited) (the operating company of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) in Qatar) on the 5th February, 1937. Geological survey work has been carried out and arrangements have been made to commence deep drilling operations in the autumn of 1938. 12. Considerable difficulty has arisen between His Majesty's Government and the Saudi Arabian Government with regard to the boundaries between Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia. Ibn Saud claims a frontier which in effect overlaps the limits of the concession held by Petroleum Development (Qatar) (Limited) and indicated in the map attached to the concession. His Majesty's Government do not admit Ibn Saud's claim, but have offered him a frontier which, while lying to the south of the Qatar concession boundary, is nevertheless beyond what they regard as the legal limit laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914. The Trucial Sheikhdoms. 13. The position in the Trucial States is as follows :— 14 Ajman. —Petroleum Concessions (Limited) held an option giving them the exclusive right to explore for oil in this territory for a period of two years. The option period expired on the 22nd January, 1938, but the company have so far failed to induce the sheikh to grant an oil concession. 15. Abu Dhabi. —The option of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) expired on the 3rd January, 1938. Negotiations for a concession were recently suspended as the sheikh is proving difficult. 16. Debai. —Petroleum Concessions (Limited) hold a concession in respect of this territory for a period of seventy-five years (Commercial Agreement dated the 22nd May, 1937, and Political Agreement dated the 5th February, 1937). No work has so far been carried out. 17. Ras-al-Khaimah. —The option of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) expired on the 1st August, 1937. A political agreement, preceding the conclusion of a commercial agreement, was signed on the 25th March, 1938. Negotiations for the latter are in suspense. 18. Sharjah. —Petroleum Concessions (Limited) hold a concession in respect of this area for a period of seventy-five years (Commercial Agreement dated the 17th September, 1937; Political Agreement signed the 12th November, 1937). 19. Umm-al-Quwaim. —No option or concession has yet been obtained in respect of this territory, but the sheikh recently informed Petroleum Concessions (Limited) that he was cc willing to negotiate.' A den Protectorate. 20. An application for an oil exploration licence in respect of this territory has been made by Petroleum Concessions (Limited) and also jointly by the Standard Oil Company of California and the Texas Corporation. Petroleum Concessions (Limited) have priority, and the Protectorate authorities have been recommended to grant that company an exclusive exploration permit for a term of two years, after which the other companies could be given an exclusive permit in respect of the territory not retained by Petroleum Concessions (Limited). A draft of the exploration permit has been agreed between the Colonial Office and the [330 1-1] B 2company, and sent to the Governor for consideiation. ^ j he ' d1 Concessions (Limited) have been given permission to send an exploiation paity to the Protectorate (see also note under Muscat and Oman ). Saudi Arabia: (i) Red Sea Area. 21 The petroleum rights in this area were granted to Petroleum Concessions^ (Limited) on the 9th July, 1936. The concession runs for a period of sixty years and covers the whole of the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia o a depth of 100 ki cm. (together with the Farsan and other islands and territorial waters) Prospecting work has been carried out by Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) (Limited) —the local operating company of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) but with the exception of the Farsan Islands and a very small stretch of the coast the resultsl have been disappointing. Saudi Arabia: (ii) Nejd. 22. (a) Hasa.—The oil rights in this area were conceded to the Standard Oil Company of California by Ibn Saud on the 27th May, 1933. The eon- cession has since been transferred to the California Arabian standard Oil Company, a subsidiary company, the share capital of which is wholly owned by Standard Oil Company of California and the Texas Corporation equally. Ine concession runs for a period of sixty years. 1 he area of the concession as set out in the relevant article of the concession agreement is as follows : 'All of Eastern Saudi Arabia, from its eastern boundary (including islands and territorial waters), westward to the westerly edge of the Dahana, and from the northern boundary to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia, provided that from the northern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana the westerly boundary of the area in question shall continue in a straight line north, 30 degrees west, to the northern boundary of Saudi Arabia, and from the southern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana, such boundary shall continue in a straight line south, 30 degrees east, to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia.' 23. Drilling has been carried out by the company and some oil has been found. It has recently been reported that a well giving 3,400 barrels of oil per day has been brought in. Some of the oil from Hasa is being taken to Bahrein for refining. It is also understood that plans for the development of a port on the Hasa coast are under consideration and that the necessary chart will shortly be prepared by the Admiralty on the basis of information supplied by the company as the result of a survey carried out by them. 24. (b) Remainder of Nejd. —The position as regards oil exploration rights in territory of Saudi Arabia not included in the Red Sea area or Hasa area concessions, referred to above, is uncertain. It was believed at the time that the Hasa concession agreement had been supplemented by a special agreement or *' secret clause,' giving the Standard Oil Company of California some kind of an option on this territory, but details were lacking. 25. Information has recently been received, however, which points to the probability that on the 29th May, 1933, the Saudi Arabian Government and the company agreed upon a modified form of the concession signed on the 27th May (referred to in paragraph 22), the modifications consisting of the addi tion of two extra articles, numbered respectively 3 and 7, which have been inserted in their appropriate positions in the body of the original agreement of the 27th May, the subsequent articles being appropriatelv renumbered, and a revised version of the (renumbered) article 35. 26. The effect inter alia of these additional articles (or special agreement) is to accord to the Standard Oil Company of California a preference right to acquire an oil concession covering the balance of Eastern Saudi Arabia extending as far west of the westerly boundary of the exclusive aiea {i-e., the llasa concession area) as the contact between the sedimentary and igneous formations.' ^ Majesty s Government are not at present aware whether or where t is contact line has been established, t here is presumablv an area uncovered by any concession or preference rights between the ' contact line,' wherever that may be, and the eastern boundary of the Red Sea concession.W 3^ 27. A further provision is that the Standard Oil Company of California shall have the right to recover 'by means of deductions from one-half of the royalties due to the Government' the amount of two loans totalling £50,000 gold received by the Saudi Arabian Government from the company. 28. On the same date as the conclusion of this modified agreement letters were exchanged by the company and the Saudi Arabian Government defining the company's preference rights in regard to {a) '' the balance of Eastern Saudi Arabia ' referred to in paragraph 26 above, and (&amp;) the Koweit Neutral Zone (see paragraph 7 above). The effect of these preference rights in {a) is to entitle the company to acquire an oil concession on terms equal to those which may be offered to the Saudi Arabian Government by another company. If the Standard Oil Company of California elect not to exercise their right, the Saudi Arabian Government is free to accept the other company's offer. Otherwise, the Standard Oil Company of California's preference right shall continue at least so long as the provisions of the special agreement remain in force. The Yemen. 29. No concession has so far been obtained in this territory owing to the attitude of the Imam Yahya, who opposes the exploitation of his country by foreign interests. The French interests in Petroleum Concessions (Limited) have, how ever, been successful in inducing the Imam to permit two geologists to visit the Yemen for a period of six months. Muscat and Oman. 30. Two concessions( 3 ) have been obtained from the Sultan of Muscat and Oman by Petroleum Concessions (Limited), one in respect of Muscat and Oman except the district of Dhofar and the other in respect of Dhofar. Both commer cial agreements are dated the 24th June, 1937, and run for a period of seventy- five years. The Sultan at first showed himself averse from being associated in any way with any political agreement between His Majesty's Government and the company. This question was, however, discussed with the Sultan during his visit to this country in April of this year, and the Sultan in the end agreed to be associated with such an agreement in a modified form. 31. An aerial exploration which it is hoped to carry out in the eastern portion of the Aden Protectorate will probably include the western portion of Muscat and Oman. Refinery Agreement with Petroleum Concessions {Limited). 32. A general Refinery Agreement was entered into between His Majesty's Government and Petroleum Concessions (Limited) on the 5th February, 1937. Briefly, the agreement provides that whenever the production of crude oil in the areas over which the company hold, or may hold, oil concessions in the Persian Gulf area reaches a total of 500,000 tons per annum, the company shall erect, on a site to be agreed, a refinery or refineries with a total capacity of not less than 250,000 tons per annum, unless it can be shown to the satisfaction of His Majesty's Government that this would be precluded by commercial considerations. The agreement also provides for a re-examination of the question of the refinerv capacity in the event of the total annual production exceeding 1 million tons per annum. Pre-emfption of Oil in the Event of an Emergency. 33. The political agreements entered into between His Majesty's Govern ment and Petroleum Concessions (Limited), in respect of the concessions secured ]by the company in Qatar, Debai, Sharjah and Ras-al-Khaimah, provide, inter alia, that in the event of a state of national emergency or war (of the existence of which His Majesty's Government shall be the sole judge) His Majesty's Govern ment shall have the sole right of pre-emption of all crude oil obtained under the concessions and of all the products thereof. His Majesty's Government have also the right to require the company to the extent of any refining capacity it may have ( 8 ) A separate concession may be granted by the Sultan later for his Asiatic territory, i .e., Gwadur.in each State (but see the preceding paragraph defining the refinery position) to produce oil fuel that shall comply with the Admiralty specifications at the time, provided that the oil is of a suitable kind and quality for this purpose, and to take control of the company's works, plant and premises. Similar P ro ^ lsl( -&gt;ns appear in the political agreement between His Majesty s Government and the Koweit Oil Company. In the case of Muscat and Oman pre-emption will not be provided for in the modified form of political agieement with which the SultajL will be associated (see note under Muscat and Oman above) but in &amp; separate agreement between His Majesty's Government and Petroleum Concessions (Limited). . , tt - n/r • i. j ^ 34. No political agreement was entered into between His Majesty s bovern- ment and the Bahrein Petroleum Company in respect of the concession in Bahrein (nor is pre-emption provided for in the lease granted to the company by the Sheikh of Bahrein), but in view of the sheikh's special treaty relations with His Majesty's Government it is not anticipated that any difficulty would occur in securing the pre-emption of Bahrein oil in the event of an emergency.

I am asked by Mr. Thornburg from ilew York this morning, to assure you once again of this Company's willingness to co-operate with the British G-overnment in every way possible, and to enquire whether there are any steps further to those already taken which you would like the Company to take now to assist the Government. I presume that the Company will be notified through the medium of the Political Agent of the local needs and desires from time to time, so far as the Company are concerned, of His Majesty's Government. If, however, there is anything which we here in London or the Company in New York, can do to assist, please do not hesitate to let them know either through me, or, if for any reason you wish to do so, direct to Mr .M .W.

(E 6229/196/91). 21st S e p t einb e r ? 1939. Dear Peel ? Would you please refer to your letter P.Z.5216/39 of the 31st August regarding the pre-emption of Bahrein and Hasa oil? 2, As far as Bahrein is concerned, we understand the position to he as follows. His Majesty's Government wish to enter into an agreement with the Bahrein Petroleum Company which will cover, inter alia 9 the pre-emption of their oil in certain circumstances. The Company object to this on the ground that it would greatly complicate their contracts with the firms to whom they supply oil ? if these firms knew that such a clause might become operative. If 9 on the other hand, there were no such clause, and the oil were in fact pre-empted 'by His Majesty's Government through the Government of Bahrein, the Company would simply plead 'restraint of princes' and everything would 'be all right so far as their obligations to third parties were concerned. 3. Meanwhile, the Company have said that for their part they are anxious to co-operate in every way possible with His Majesty's Government and only ask to be informed of the local needs of His Majesty's Government from time to time. This being so, I presume that the statement in your letter, that 'the Company are fully aware of the possibility of such action' means that they will not object to, and may even welcome forcible action of the kind contemplated, as protection for themselves against third-party claims. 4. If this is so, we see no reason to object, and agree that, if Bahrein oil is required by His Majesty's R.T. Peel, Esq., C.B.E. , M.C.o C' • Government before the conclusion of the pre-emption agreement with the Company, action will have to be taken by the Sheikh as the Political Resident suggests. If, on the other hand., we have not rightly understood the posiuion, and there is any chance of the Company objecting to the proposed measure, we should like to have an opportunity of offering further observations before any action is taken. 5, v/e agree that, in the absence of any pre-emption agreement regarding Hasa oil lying in the Bahrein refinery, it would be preferable not to commandeer it. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) H.M. Eyres.^7 INDIA OFFICE, Y/HITEHAli, LONDON, S.W.I P.Z. 5933/39 25th September, 1939 Dear Eyres, Many thanks for your letter of the 81st September (E 6229/196/91) about the pre-emption of Bahrein and Hasa oil.

The telegram to which he refers was merely a reminder relating to his - ' fn J . .

' 2. The letter of 26th May 1938 to which Prior refers enclosed s. copy of a memorandum by the Oil Board referring to their meeting of the 11th April, 1938, in which, while endorsing the Petroleum Department's view of the importance of Bahrein as a source of oil supply, they gave/ arling, Esq., C.B.E., etroleum Department , Mines Department, Dean Stanley Street, S.W.I.r£) n 2. gave their opinion of the relative importance of Trinidad, Rangoon and Bahrein in this connexion and put Bahrein third in the order of priority of these three sources of oil supply. 3. Prior-also refers to a Committee of Imperial Defence .paper containing a report 'by the Chiefs of Staff Sub Committee on a defence scheme for Bahrein. The relevant extracts are ;- u We note that the Oil Board have now assessed Bahrein as 'being less important as a source of oil supply than Rangoon or Trinidad ? and we understand that the oil from this source is mainly suitable for commercial purposes Moreover ? the oil from the Bahrein oilfields has too high a sulphur content to 'be used in His Majesty's ships except in an emergency, and all supplies are normally provided from Ahadan.' ! 7/^ *** I,' i % * f tr I % * 4. In replying to the Resident's telegram ahout the British employees of the Oil Company we authorised him (after consultation with the interested Departments here) to inform them that His Majesty's Government attach the highest importance to ensuring in war-time tne uninterrupted maintenance of the available sources of oil^ particularly in territories under British influence or control, and are therefore/therefore most anxious that there should 'be no iiitCx lei ence wi tne output o.L Balirein oil^ even though tiioj' should n^ c I--e dra-i/in^ upon chis source ox sunDly at the moment'. We assume the position to be that, even though the products of the Bahrein refinery are at present unsuitable for Hoyal Air Force use and though the Navy prefer less odorous oil if it is available, Bahrein is nevertheless regarded 'by His Majesty's Government as of considerable (potential) importance as a reserve source of supply, with the corollary that His Majesty's Government think it essential that the oil installation should continue to function efficiently and should be protected against damage by sabotage or otherwise.

Paragraph 5 of that letter the view was accepted that it would 'be preferable not to commandeer any Hasa oil lying in the Bahrein refinery. We have since gone into the question more fully and5 though we do not appear to have received the text of any agreement between C.A.S.O.C. and the Bahrein Petroleum Company, it would seem from the enclosures to your official letter P.Z.4221/38 of the 30th Junej 1938, that the Hasa oil may be bought by the Bahrein Petroleum Company. If this is so ? there would appear to be no need to differentiate between Bahrein and Hasa oil ? if the question, of commandeering should' arise ? as all the oil in the Bahrein refinery would belong to the Bahrein Petroleum Company. 4.

Reference Agency Printed letter No.C/982-lC/l dated the 17th December 1940. 2. During the recent absence on leave of Dr. Kennedy, Mr. Lipp, the General Manager, was allowed to act as Chief Local Representative in his place. During this period, it was found that matters between the Company and this Agency were much more expeditiously disposed of than previously and it is suggested that, as a war measure and in order to facilitate the transaction of business, Mr. Lipp may be allowed to act as Chief Local Representative in addition to being General Manager. This arrangement might be personal to Mr. Lipp only and subject to revision should he be succeeded by another. 3. It is noted that His Majesty's Government attach considerable importance to the Company's Chief Local Repre sentative being a British subject and persona grata to them^ in order to ensure harmonious relations between the Company and the Bahrain population and the local authorities and also /-2 i also owing 'to 'the specia?^ 'treaty relatiop^exis'ting (vide paragraph No.3 of Colonial Office letter No.18301/33 dated the 31st July 1933 forwarded to this Agency under Bushire Printed letter No.l038-S dated the 17th August 1933). But I do not anticipate any interference with these aims5 rather the reverse since Mr. Lipp is a most conscientious man who carefully guards his Company's good name. A further matter for consideration is that the General Manager is the only man on the spot in whom real authority vests and it is therefore somewhat tiresome and irrelevant being compelled to deal with a go-between who is not a responsible official.

C/729. On May 17th 1941, when Dr. R. A. Kennedy was acting as Chief Local Representative, letter COK-810 was written to Mr. C.D.Belgrave, as per copy attached. Formerly certain letters were addressed to Mr. Belgrave, who in turn took these matters up with the Political Agent, but I agree with you that it is entirely wrong according to Article 16, to follow this proce dure. You were also to have received a copy ot letter C0N'81C / although according to your letter of July 9th you have never received any communication on this subject. Please find attached copy of our original letter to Mr. Belgrave, and a copy of his reply. In the meantime we have prepared these records and shipped them on the 'Florence Luckenbach on June 6, 194j. to New York, as per copy of shipping documents attached. I hereby make official application to you to send these records to a place of greater safety, and would appreciate your endorsement. In the future I will see that all communications are directed to you on matters pertaining to the Lease. Thanking you for your consideration of this matter. Yours very truly, Sd. M. H. Lipp. Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited.The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, Av/al i. May 17, 1941. C0W-810 C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esq., C.B.S., Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Dear Sir, Article XIX of the Lease stipulates that the Company shall keep in Bahrain geological plans and drilling logs. If it should happen that Bahrain falls into the hand^ of the enemy these date would be of immense value to him; indeed, without such plans and logs, the field would probably be useless to him for many months. We can, if you wish, arrange to keep all these documents - except ones in current use - elsewhere than here. A few we w would have to keep could easily be destroyed in emergency# If you agree that it would be wise to take these documents to a place of greater safety will you please give us specific permission temporarily to disregard Article XIX of the Lease.

But all questions affecting the Lease are of considerable importance, and according to Article XVI of the Lease, the Company should have taken up the matter through this Agency. I have drawn the Company's attention to the irregularity of approaching the Bahrain Government direct in this matter.

We have not been told the reasons making this step necessary except that it is wwing to the war. In India petrol rationing has been enforced in • - ' order to enable the government to build up oil reserves. Recently I read in one of the Indian papers a statement that no r elaxation of the rationing could be contemplated as the government had not yet built up sufficient reserves. This was published to contradict some incorrect statements that petrol rationing was to be relaxed. Here in Bahrain we have quantities of oilj Bahrain is the nearest oil producing area to the east side of India, petrol is required in India, yet production is being slowed down in Bahrain. The position appears il logical to people who afe not acquaiited with oil politics and exchange matters. Would it be possible to ask the Company to explain fully the reasons which make It neces sary to reduce production of Bahrain oil ? We should like to know whether it is owing to difficulties of shipping, exchange or market agreements.Confidential fl.O. tt&gt;. C/1090 Political Agency, Bahrain, the ISth Kovembor 1941.

Bahrain is the nearest oil producing area on the western aide of India; petrol is required in India and yet exports of petrol from Bahrain are falling off* On the face of it the difficulty appears to be due to lack of shipping* Possibly there may be other reasons as well such as exchange difficulties or market agreements with oil companies and I should be most grateful if you could kindly throw some further light on the situation.

It appears from this that the bulk of available tankers are being used to transport Anglo-Iranian oil, thus causing a shortage of transport here.

Large decrease in consumption in India, Australia and New Zealand which is due principally to rationing. ,t 2nd. Shortage of tankers which in turn causes rationing. ' Exchange or market agreement has nothing to do with decreased refinery operations or export of oil from Bahrain. On account of Bahrain being closer to India and Africa than Abadan we now have the matter under discussion with British Oil Companies to the effect that Bahrain should operate full capacity to save tankers' time, but naturally friends located at the Head of the Gulf reluctant to further reduce their operations in order to accomplish the above. Can see no objection to the Political Agent or His Highness bringing the above matter to the attention of the India Office and H.M's Government 1 . 1 Obviously the 'friends located at the Head of the Gulf are the Anglo- Iranian Company. In view of Mr. Herron's remarks we should be very pleased If you can shed further light on this subject by communication with the India Office.

The former say (P.96) that the question rests with a statement made in llay 1940 in London that Cable &amp; Wireless Local Manager had been instructed to get into touch with Bahrain and to assist G.A.S.O.C in the direction they wanted', whereas the latter state (Enclosure to p.u.o) that 'we have expressed to that Company our readiness to install the requisite apparatus at Bahrain' but the Cpmpany •have again insisted in the desirability of installing their own equipment by reason of the terms of their working agreement with Saudi Arabia 11 . 2. In the meantime the Bahrain Petroleum Company have applied for permission to install their own apparatus (P.ioo) and among the reasons they give for their request the following is the most importants- 'The Saudi Arabian Government have consented to the operation of such communications between our offices, with the proviso that the Company Station in Arabia shall work only with our private Company Station in Bahrain and not with a Commercial or any other Station here. 1 * , 3 * In regard to the assurance said to have been given to Cable and Wireless in 1938» Please see P.103. No formal request was received for a sort of monopoly licence from the Shaikh but unofficially the Company Manager was told that they probably had little need to fear the introduction of a foreign international communications Company so long as H.M.G extended their protection to the Shaikh fcf Bahrain**. This happened in March 1938.We have nothing on record to show the detailed j terms on which Gable and Wireless took over I.E.r # D under takings in the Gulf (P*37) and unless we know these it will be difficult to say whether, if permission is granted to the oil companies, the proposed radio telephone 'will not encroach upon the rights of Cable and Wireless Limited under any existing agreement f'46). k tfj/fo P,R . . jT The Oil Company have already approached the P*A. with a view to establishing direct coiraaunication v/ith the mainland ip.96). ^e should perhaps inform the 1.0, of this by telegram forwarding copies of the iVv.'s letters to the i # 0. under P.L. Uur views on the subject o^ the 8c ^ • * s monopoly to work commercial telegraphs in Bahrain have been put forward to the 1.0. in your letter dated June 6th (jD.87) . As a possible solution to the present impasse we may perhaps put forward the suggestion contained in para.6 of P .A.Bahrain 's X.L. dated 1st July (p.98). ^ P.A.Bahrain 1 s X.L.No .G/545-10/15 of 1st July (jp.103) explains the position in regard to the assurance alleged 1 to have been given to the a.&amp; W. in 1938. v / 15.7.40. ll '~ e - (f i-L rrg.s i-U- Slo . .* tS 2, / / ^) c*~ c** rv , Yol.S *93 p • 2 20 • s( f £ . /Vb . ajso^ cC, (&amp;j&lt;+ jif ( , t f \f\ T.R.

The present proposal does not affect that Article which does not specify that the G.L,R # should be a British subject, but it does Article 4 of the Political Agreement of 29.6•40. it would appear^that the Bahrain Government's concurrence should also be obtained.

The volume is a direct continuation of ‘File 86/2 XIV (C 67) Bahrain Oil’ (IOR/R/15/1/662). The principal correspondents in the volume are the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Fowle until August 1939, Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Geoffrey Prior thereafter), the Political Agent in Bahrain, (Captain Tom Hickinbotham until October 1937, Hugh Weightman from October 1937 to October 1940, and Major Reginald Alban thereafter), and various local representatives of BAPCO.The subjects covered by the volume are:Preferences (or preferred markets) for Bahrain oil, with Australia and New Zealand proposed, and British opposition to the principle of preferences, on the grounds that oil production in Britain’s empire is too small (folios 4-11);Changes to the appointment of BAPCO’s Chief Local Representative, with numerous incumbents of the post: John Black, C. Deacon, Dr Kennedy and Milton Lipp.Most of the volume’s correspondence refers to the impact of the Second World War upon Bahrain and BAPCO activities:Discussion amongst British officials over the possible pre-emption of Bahrain oil (folios 38, 52-53), and BAPCO’s willingness to cooperate with the British Government (folio 49);Discussion of the strategic importance of Bahrain’s oil, the release of BAPCO employees for military service, and defence of BAPCO facilities (folios 57-59);An enquiry from the Air Ministry regarding Bahrain’s ability to produce aviation fuel and at what rate, with a detailed technical response from BAPCO staff (folios 75, 77-78);The Political Agent’s preference for Milford Lipp as Chief Local Representative, because communications have been ‘expeditiously disposed of’ under Lipp’s authority (folios 81-91, 106-08); Lipp’s status as a U.S. citizen, leading to an agreement signed by Shaikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah and BAPCO, permitting the appointment of a non-British citizen as Chief Local Representative for the duration of the war (folios 93, 113);Lipp’s suggestion that the Company’s geological plans and records be moved to a secure location (New York), to prevent them falling into enemy hands, a proposal agreed to by all parties concerned (folios 96-103);A drop in oil production in Bahrain in 1941 (folios 109, 116-16A), as a result of reduced demand due to petrol rationing to supply areas such as India, and a shortage of available tankers (folios 119-20); explanation of the drop in royalties to Shaikh Hamad; a subsequent increase in production at the end of 1941 (folios 124-30).The volume also includes a press cutting from the
                           Iraq Times, dated 9 November 1937, which remarks on the superior quality of Bahrain’s oil (folio 12), and a copy of BAPCO’s accounts for the first half of 1938 (folios 36-37).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sitrah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Bahrain</topic></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum products</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00027d#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
