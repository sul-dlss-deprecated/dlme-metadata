Karima, a member of the Abu Omran tribe, her family long lived in Qurna. She describes her fatherâ€™s spacious house and its furnishings, where she lived with extended family; while it had electricity, water was brought by donkey cart. She tells of the purchase of food from a local market, the baking of bread at home in mud ovens, and her taking care of animals and livestock and making cheese for sale. While unmarried, her brother and two sisters have spouses. Karima says that her father made the call to prayer at the village mosque, and that locals frequently visited the shrine of Sheikh Abdo Qurna for blessings for marriage, sickness, etc. She fondly recalls interactions with tourists and other visitors from outside Qurna, but laments terrorist incidents that hurt tourism as her sister-in-law Nadia points to the 2011 revolution as diminishing tourism.  The town where they have been relocated receives no tourist visitors, which has reduced income and caused many young men to move to Aswan or coastal resorts in Sharm El Sheikh and Hurghada for employment. Karima recollects the sadness of the day they were displaced, including the demolition of their home in front of them. She relates the poor construction of the homes in the new village where they were relocated, calls life there less healthy, and paints a portrait of an unhappier life in the new settlement. </dc:description><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:coverage>Al Qurnah, Egypt</dc:coverage><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>Qurna Hillside Oral History Project; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
