In the arrangements originally made for the East Persian Consulates the cost of escorts and consulate guards wa.s included in the office allowance contract grant. Subsequently, owing to the fact that regular Indian Cavalry escorts were provided, separate budget provision was made # But on P.Z.1158/33 Colonel Daly, when making his proposals for the amalgamation of the Meshed and Seistan Consulates, sought sanction for the inclusion in the combined office allowance contract grant of the escort charges. The reason for the proposal was that recruitment has now become local it would therefore/be possible for him to adjust local expenditure under 1his head according to local conditions if he had complete control of the funds allotted ^or that purpose. This was one of the consequential arrangements sanctioned on P.Z.4658/33. For the same reasons as in the case of Seistan Colonel Daly now proposes that the Zahidan Vice-Consulate guards should in future be paid from the office allowance grant and that necessary provision be made in the grant for that purpose. At present any variation in the standard of wages or in the scale of fodder would apparently require special sanction involving waste of time and money. It seems obviously desirable in the circumstances to place expenditure on this account under the direct control of the Consulate General and it is therefore submitted that the proposal might be sanctioned. As no extra expenditure will be involved but merely transfer of funds from one head to another it does/ 2119 5000 8/33Draft Paper. 7Z, V © Department. DRAFT LETTER. U.S.S., F.O.

As far as Sistan Escort Charges are concerned, no such question arises now as the Escort Charges have been included in the Office Allowance Grant as sanctioned by the Government of India in their letter No. P.331-N/32, dated the 9th September 1933 and I have informed him accordingly• 3 . The sanction to Vice Consulate Guards was S accorded in Foreign and Political Department Memorandum S No. F.194-V28, dated the 7th November 1928. Tnis was ^ in the replacement of the Infantry Guard at Zahidan by ten Indian Army pensioners at an annual cost of Rs. 5200/-. The Guards were further reduced u ' 3e;un - ffien a t an annual cost of Rs. 3,700/- and with effect from the© the current financial year I have further reduced then to five nen, owing to economy, &amp;t an annual cost of Rs# 2*700/-. In this connection, please refer to my letter No. 1I75/I/44, dated the 14th December 1933* in which I have applied for formal sanction to this reduction. 4. The Indian Army pensioners did not remain in Zahidan and submitted their resignation and local Baluchis were engaged who were ex-Levy men. These are neither pensionable nor military pensioners on contract and the condition under which the budget allotment was provided under C.2. Fay of Establishment does not exist and to split so small a grant as Rs. 2*70o/- into three li different sub heads - pay of Establishment, AllowanceS^nd Honoraria and Contingencies - is highly inconvenient. 5. Under the circumstances* I beg to request that the provision of Rs. 2*700/- on account of Vice Consulate Guards at Zahidan may kindly be included in the Zahidan Office Allowance Grant on the same grounds as in the case of Sistan. The Zahidan Vice Consulate Office Allowance Grant was originally sanctioned at Rs. 3,900/- per annum vide correspondence ending with Foreign and political Department Memorandum No. F.457-a/ 30* dated the 4th August 1931, *hich was further reduced on account of medical drugs by Rs. 7 50/- as per Foreign and political Department Memorandum No.F.429- j/31, dated the 15th March 1932. The allotment now stands at Rs. 3,150/-. To this, the provision of Rs. 2,700/- on account of Guards be added and the annual grant be fixed at Rs. 5,850/- or for rounding figures at Rs. 5,900/-. There are many grounds why the inclusion of this small grant in the Office Contract Grant is advisable, e.g. pay depends on local supply and demand while cost of clothing and equip ment constantly varies owing to the vagaries of the Persian Customs etc. In some oases it may be possible to reduce pay to meet extra cost of equipment or vice versa. Occasional 1 v &lt;a-3- leave c&amp;n be arranged under local agreements. All these minor charges would require the sanction of the Government cif India involving clerical labour. The Vice Consul will of course be held responsible that the grant* being part of the Office Allowance Contingencies be not exceeded and expendi ture is further controlled by me. Though it cannot be accurately determined without actual experience I fully anticipate that if the grant be included in Office Allowance thus enabling us to effect economies as occasion occurs, I shall be in a position in future to recommend a reduction in the amount hitherto spent.

As it is incorrect to adjust the expenditure on account of allowances and contingencies of the Escorts or the Vice Consulate Guards under the detailed head 'Pay of permanent or temporary Establishment* under the unit 'Pay of jis ^oiblish ment* as has been done in the past it is requested that such charges may kindly be classified under 'Allowances or Contingencies* as the case may be from the current year’s accounts* Steps may also please be taken at an early date to provide the necessary funds under those units, by reappropriation, under intimation to this office.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0000d0_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3646</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0000d0</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3646</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 29/70 'Consular escorts'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1933/1941</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-09-25T10:50:38</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (22 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 26; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file concerns the Zahidan [Zahedan, Iran] Vice-Consulate.The file covers:reduction of Zahidan Vice Consulate Guardsproposal to include Vice Consulate Guard charges in Zahidan Office Allowance Grantengagement of military pensioners for the Tehran Legation.The file is composed of correspondence between the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, the Foreign Office, the India Office, the Government of India, the British Legation at Tehran, and the Adjutant-General in India.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Vice-Consulate</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0000d0#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
