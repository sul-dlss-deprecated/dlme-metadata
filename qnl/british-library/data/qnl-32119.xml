The agreement by means oi an exchange of letters is considered satisfactory, but as the tenancy is of a temporary nature it is felt that it should be on a monthly basis at the most.

Agreement has been reached here on all points of the proposed Muscat-Muttrah Telephone Licence and the draft should reach London tomorrow for our Managing Director*s final approval. It is hoped therefore that the Automatic Telephone System will be in operation before the end of next year, but the number of potential subscribers are few and therefore the revenue small, in comparison with other places. Negotiations are not quite so advanced in connection with the proposed external Wireless Telegraph and Telephone Licence principally because of difficulties presented by the initial stipulation that telecommunication facilities with Salalah and Gwadur from Muscat were to be provided. However, alternative proposals are taking shape and a suggested draft agreement has been made in which a few points may require modification before it can be sent to London for final approval, A spare copy of the Automatic Telephones draft (sent to London) afld of the Wireless Telegraph and Telephone draft (still to be agreed locally) are in Wray’s office safe as they have not yet reached finality, but he will discreetly give you or show you them for your confidential information should you wish to scan them at this stage, or I will bring them along to your office before I leave if you prefer it but I imagine how ^ busy you must be preparing for your distinguished visitors.

BdARTIN'S LE GRAND LONDON, E, C, I. P.O. Ref: 14993/ 38/29 9th November, 1949# W.S073 Dear Mb. Spinney, With reference to the despatch of the I4th June form the Political Resident of the Persian Gulf about Cable and Wireless Ltd's draft concessions to operate in Muscat, and to our relative letter to Mr. Lansbury of Cable and Wireless Ltd., copies of which were sent to you and Mr. Burrows, the Company have now advised us of the up to date position of the negotiations in connections with the concession. To recapitulate the events of the last two years, when the question of the installation by the Company of a public automatic telephone system in Miscat arose in 1947 the Company were then in possession of (i) a brief form of license(as compared by the Sultan) to land and operate cables at Muscat for the period 1st January 1939 - 31st December 1987, and (ii) correspondence between the Sultan and the Political Agent, Muscat, under which the Company were permitted to install a wireless set at Muscat for emergency purposes only. At this point the Company thought it would be desirable to seek a comprehensive telecommuni cations license ( similar to the license granted by the Shaikh of Bahrain) covering the cable landing, the wire less station and the telephone system. A comprehensive draft license was therefore prepared by the Company in consultation with the Political Resident via the Common wealth Relations Office, and the draft was sent to the Company's representatives in the Persian Gulf in July 1948 for negotiation with the Sultan. The document was so set out that it could be used with or without the inclusion of Gwarur in the light of any advice the Company might receive from the Commonwealth Relation Office about the Political situation relative to Gwadur. Because; hov/ever, of the Sultan's or his Adviser's, absences from Muscat the Company's representative was unable to make any positive progress in the matter of the draft license, but in June of this year he received from the Sultan's Foreign Minister drafts of Wireless I'ele phone and Telegraph License and a Mi sc at-Mat tr ah Telephone linense r, made out in a form agreeable to the Sultan’* with a intimation that the Sultan wished to retain the original cable landing license of 1939. The draft of the Wireless license obliges the Company to have stations capable of communi cating with Muscat installed and working at Salafa h and Gwadur within a period of three years. The Company are quite agreeable not to proceed further in endeavouring to obtain a comprehensive license and they ha&lt;sre asked their Divisional ftoager to negoiate direct with the Sultan on the individual licenses and to obtain his agreement to the omission of reference to Gwadur I * and if possible Salalah fcom the draft Wireless license. The Divisional Manager has also been instructed to keep in touch with the Politiacl Agent on all matters concerning the licenses. Do you wish to have a copy of the draftlicense a£d the Company^ detailed comments on it? The Company are not anxious to proceed with installation of the telephone system until negotiations with the Sultan have reached a more or less final stage to ensure against new onerous terms being demanddd once the Company is proceeding with installations. They have sought the Divisional Manager's views on this, and we shall let you know what transpires. I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Burrows. Yours Sincerely, 3d Bridges./, ? &lt;U * * A ML Mi* &lt; • v )( A sugrested torn, for further diBCus^ion, of a revised Draft jbm—, w—numiy^^ •• &gt; ' ■ *•*»-**&gt;** ■ ~'TS rry ^ *■ ' 'c m) WIRKLBSS TBL^PHONK AKD 78LBCIRAPH LXCBNCB THB 3 ULTANATB OF MUSCAT AMD OMAH AND CABLE AI® WIRKLRS3 LIMITED 7 A'® BY TriSlSiS PRBSETJTS TKS SULTAN OP MUSCAT A'TL OEA.'&lt; 0RA.'!T3 UNTO MESSRS OASL S Aft) WIRKLSSS LIMITSO) A COMPANY Xf.COHPO-tATKD IN KHOI&lt;ANO AND HKRSIKAFT R RiSPSR ■HI.
