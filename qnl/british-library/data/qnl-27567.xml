Economic and Financial Information: Co-operation between His Majesty’s Missions and Consulates. Sir, In my circular despatch W 4907/293/50 of the 1st June last I made suggestions regarding closer co-operation among members of the staffs of diplomatic missions with a view to the co-ordination and development of an economic intelligence system in relation to political work. 2. This despatch was followed by a second despatch on corresponding lines addressed to consular officers stationed in foreign colonial territories^ 1 ) 3. I have now been considering whether this principle of co-ordination and closer co-operation should not be extended to the work of the consular service as a whole, since, especially in the economic sphere, its importance as part of the general intelligence system of His Majesty’s Government is bound to increase. 4. I have reached the conclusion that it would be to the advantage of the diplomatic and consular services alike if steps could now be taken to give the latter some instruction or direction, similar to that already given to the former in my circular despatch under reference, having these two principal objects in view: (1) that missions and consulates should be brought into closer relation with one another, and (2) that consulates should receive more information than is at present the case regarding the current situation in their respective countries. P) Foreign Office circular W 6658/293/50 of the 1st August, 1934, addressed to His Majesty’s consular officers at Leopoldville, Algiers, Dakar, Saigon, Tripoli, Tangier, Batavia, Medan, Madeira, Loanda, Lourengo Marques, Tenerife, Beirut, Tunis, Manila, Tamsui, Honolulu, Bushire, Mukden and Rabat. His Majesty’s Representative [p.t.o. at (056/1934) _ ■ ''U'E IN WEEKLY r * 7577 ,04,, ' r fo. 43 25 OCT 1934 FRO.,1 ^iCRETARY, POLITiCAL J SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFICE5. The object which 1 have in view can, I think, be best promoted along four parallel lines, as follows :— (a) Just as I have myself issued instructions to His Majesty’s Missions as to the manner and matter of their reporting on politico- economic subjects, so should the Heads of Missions issue corresponding instructions to all the career consular officers under 1 their superintendence (with the exception of those to whom direct instructions have already been sent, as explained in paragraph 2), indicating the kind of information which they wish to receive and the form in which it should be supplied. (b) Heads of Missions should further arrange for annual, or, if required, more frequent, visits to the respective capital by all superintending consular officers whose posts are within reasonable reach, and by such junior salaried officers as may, in the opinion of the superintending officer, usefully be present. Heads of Missions must decide at what time of year such gatherings should take place, and whether all the consular officers indicated should or could attend at the same time. (c) Members of His Majesty’s missions should be given every encourage ment, when the stress of work permits, to keep in personal contact with His Majesty’s consulates by visits on convenient occasions. (d) If safe opportunity is available, His Majesty’s career consular posts should receive regularly the Foreign Office print of the country where they are located, including especially the annual reports from the missions, and, in some cases, print relating to other special subjects or other neighbouring countries. G. These four points appear to me the four necessary steps to adapt the machinery of the services to modern conditions and to develop their potentialities. 7. As regards (a), I do not propose to His Majesty’s missions any particular guiding line for the instructions to be issued to consular officers. That is a matter which must be left entirely to the head of each mission, as general conditions and the problems requiring elucidation vary in every country and every district, and the missions are best qualified to know what material they most require. In some cases it may be political where the district plays an important part in the political life of the countrv; in othersit may be purely economic, agricultural, commercial or maritime. The important point is that missions should make up their minds what reports are of value to them from their consular posts and that they should instruct those posts accordingly. They will thereby save the consular officers from sending in what may be excellent but comparatively useless reports, while at the same time encouraging them to identify their observations and efforts with the line of guidance given by the mission. 8. I he suggestion contained in (b) has already been adopted in at least two cases without any special instructions having been issued to that effect, with results sufficiently satisfactory to convince me that the practice should be made more general. His Majesty’s missions should, of course, be left free to decide on the most suitable occasions for such meetings, and they should endeavour to arrange for them to take place when all or as many consular officers as possible can be present at them. Those who cannot be present on the occasion selected should be invited to visit the capital at some other time. It may be objected that regular annual or even more frequent gatherings of this kind will entail more expense than their results are likely to justify; but I do not consider that there is substance in such an objection. Consular officers already make tours in their districts, and in the great majority of countries the extra journey to the capital will not involve great additional expenditure. On the other hand, the advantage of establishing regular permanent and personal contact between the missions and consulates should be out of all proportion to the expense involved; for the advantages to be derived from this proposal will lie not so much in any visible concrete results as in the fact of its bringing the missions and consulates into more regular personal relationship and enabling them periodically to discuss and, where necessary, improve the machinery and methods of reporting on the important developments in the country as a whole. 9. Point (c) can only be put forward on the most general lines. Heads of Missions alone can decide whether and when such visits can be arranged by members of their staff. 10. Point (d )—the supply of Foreign Office print to consular posts— although unexceptionable in theory, presents certain practical difficulties, such as the choice of consulates to receive such print, the selection of the print, its conveyance by safe opportunity and its safe custody. As regards the choice of consulates, it is probable that these will have to be limited to such posts as are accessible by British ships. It may be observed that, out4 of a total of about 200 career posts, 120 are at ports, many of which have regular steamship connexions with British ports. The leading ports might therefore appropriately be taken, in the first instance, for the distribution of print to consulates. This would leave some eighty inland posts to which print might be distributed by other means. In these cases extra sections of^ print might be sent out to the missions for distribution from the capital as and when occasion offered, e.g., at the proposed annual meeting at the capital or on the occasion of individual journeys to or from the capital on the part of consular officers or members of His Majesty’s missions. As regards the selection of the print, the general rule might be adopted that in certain countries consuls would receive the annual reports and all print sections of that country, and that in others, where consulates may have greater political importance, such as Damascus and Beirut, it might be desirable to supply, in addition, the print relating to one or several neighbouring or connected countries, or to special subjects, e.g., Economic—General and Opium sections. As regards the custody of the print, it is suggested that in the instructions to be issued consular officers should be told that only the annual report of the mission for the current year should be kept, and that it should be locked away in the safe with the cyphers. Any print distributed either with the annual report or subsequently should be read and thereafter burned. If any notes are taken from this print, they must be such as can be locked away with the annual report. 11. I shall shortly forward to you a list of posts drawn up in consulta tion with the Inspectors-General of Consulates which are recommended as suitable for the beginning of a regular print distribution by safe opportunity. 12. I fully realise that the proposals embodied in this despatch cannot be applied in all countries at once. I am sure, however, that you will concur in the general desirability of the development herein proposed. I shall be glad, therefore, if, on receipt of this despatch, you will give me the benefit of your observations, indicating the lines upon which you are issuing instructions to the consular posts under your supervision, and forwarding any further suggestions which you may yourself think fit to offer in order to promote the kind of co-operation which the exigencies of modern conditions require.

I think however that you will agree ; and I have no doubt that the Foreign Office and Tehran will also ; that In view of the explanation given in the gqscj Resident’s telegram Fo.0/64, Mallet was under a mis apprehension as to the exact reason why the Basidu incident was forming the subject of considerable comment in the Gulf.

If for wide reasons of policy His Majesty ? s Government decide to accept the rote of the Persian Government, I would beg that Persian Government should be informed categorically that should there be further complaints from Arab shipping, British warships will be drafted into Persian Gulf to shepherd each Persian ship with definite instructions to use force if need be to protect British and Arab shipping.

Eighthlyo Senior ii&amp;ral Officer, who concurs with my views .a addressing Naval Commander-in-chief,FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l 21st May, 1931. (E 2555/2555/91) Dear Walton, Many thanks for your letter No. P.Z. 2915/31 of the 13th May enclosing a copy of a letter from Biscoe regarding the recent visit of Lascelles to Bushire and Bahrein. We are sending a copy of your letter and enclosures to Clive. J.C. Walton, Esq.., C.B. , M.CConf id ential * D.O.No. (p4 * J British Rssidsnoyy Bushire, the 26th April 1931. My dear Howell, would you please refer to n^y demi-official telegram No.T.115,dated the 6th November 1930, regarding the visits of members of the Legation staff to Bushire. I sm glad to say that Lascelles, one of the Secretaries of the Legf. tion, was able to visit Bushire last February and I took him with me on tour to Bahrain. We were able to discuss imny laatters of mutual interest and he was good enough to say he ^.reatly enjoyed the visit and that it would be of much assistance to him in dealing with Gulf questions in the future. I trust that this visit will be the precursor of other visits to the Gulf by members of the Legation staff. The journey from Tenran to Bushire only takes six hours now by aei’oplane and the cost involved is not large and the benefits are, in my opinion, out of all proportion to the expenditure. I cannot help feeling that tUia personal knowledge of Gulf matters and Gulf problem must be of great assistance to His Majesty's Legation not merely in connection with the f'ersian negotiations but also in connection with the various matters connected with the Gulf with which they are called upon from time to time to deal, while there is no doubt that personal conversation frequently removes #any mis understandings that may from time to time arise* I am sending a copy of this B.0. to the India Office Yours sincerely, sd/- H.V.Biscoe.It may be recorded that Mr.Lascelles paid a visit to Colonel Biscoe in February 1931, and was taken by him to Bahrein and elsewhere in the Gulf. This finally disposes of the incident. It is understood from the Resident that the visit was in fact a great success, at any rate^so far as personal relations went.(COPIES pr— ' 'r/AY WITH p.

Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State for India, Dated New Delhi, 11th November, 1930, Received 5.45 p.me, 11th November, 1930« 3§99~a» Following from Howell to Wakely* Your telegram of the 3rd instant, 3493, was repeated to BiGeoe who telegraphs. Beglnsc I should cordially welcome the visits of Legation Staff to Bushire at any time or to the Arab coast in my company, and a close touch will considerably facilitate njy task, Lxxde.^ . In my opinion, however, visit of any member of the Tehran Legation staff to places claimed by Persia might still have undesirable consequences* I will, however, discuss this with Blscoe.With your approval I discussed the Resident’s telegram of 28th October below with the Foreign Office last night. It would appear that the correspondence between Sir Robert Olive and the Foreign Office ?, r as private, and the EasternFepartirient had not been informed about it. Mr. Oliphant, on seeing the Resident’s telegram, intimated that if the India Office supported h«rvuew and felt strongly on the matter, he would be ready to telegraph privately to Mr. Parr (Sir Robert Clive has now gone on leave), \intimating that Lr. Lascelles' visit to the Gulf should be postponed, but possibly suggesting that it might be a good thing to take advantage of the Resident's offer to^take him\ round at the beginning of next year. I said that we definitely felt that the Resident had cause for complaint (with this view the Eastern Department unofficially entirely agreed), and that it would be desirable, therefore, to postpone the visit. I added that we had, I thought, no objection of principle to visits of this nature, and in fact thought that, in so far as they helped to improve liaison, they were all to the good: but we did feel that it was in principle undesirable that they should take place save with the approval of the Resident and under his auspices. As regards the present incident, we had no desire to magnify its importance. If Mr. Oliphant would telegraph on the lines he suggested, the simplest method of dealing with it on our side would be that Mr. Wakely or Mr. Dalton should telegraph privately to Mr. Howell on the lines of the draft which I now attach. The foreign Office intimated that . They have now telephoned that Mr. Oliphant/Oliphant has telegraphed privately to Tehran on the lines proposed. I now submit a draft private telegram to Mr. Howell. Since the discussion we have received an official telegram from the Government of India supporting the Resident, but for all that it will perhaps be better to leave natters on a private basisf ft(nopiss CIRCULATED) r n fro Si.

The first I hoard of it was w])on the Senior Haval Officer showed me telegram from Minister asking that sloop should pick Laecellee up at Buehir© on the 16th November, I asked the Senior Naval Officer to inform Ministor that, in my opinion, visit of member of the Legation staff in man-of-war to 3 places in dispute could not fail to create comment at the present juncture and was undesirable. Minister now informs me that visit io unofficial, and that the Foreign Office have approved and asks mo to reconsider. Fact that visit will take place in man-of-war will invest it with official character in Arab eyes, especially at Bahrein, and it will certainly be discussed. Had I bean informed earlier I could have taken Laacollos in the 'Patrick Stewart', but it is now too late. Unless there are urgent reasons for visit, I suggeet that it be postponed for 2 or o months, -hen I shall probably be visiting these places again in the 'Patrick Stewart', and shall be delighted to take member of the Legation with me. Visit in my company would create no comment at all, our mu ^ ■ Addreseod to Government of India, and repeated to lr Secretary of State for India.*(V 1 J, COPY OF - f Desirabiltt y of having an officer with Pe rsian Gulf experience on the Minister T s staff ? is ■ n0 ^ ; clear quite what ^ir Hohert Clive has in mind, and the Foreign Office are equally at a loss. Relations between the present Minister and the Government of India and the Resident have not been entirely satisfactory - this being possibly a question of personality - while similar difficulties are understood to have arisen in the past owing to the personality of Political Residents. It might be a very useful thing to have on the Minister's staff a Political Department Officer of a certain standing who could act as liaison v.ath the Government of India; but it is improbable that the Foreign Offic would welcome the appointment of such an oificer as, say, First Secretary, and a Political Department Attache - unless he was very .junior, in which case his value would probably be less great - would probably find that he had not very much to do in the ordinary course at Tehran. If, on the other hand, the Minister's idea is that the First or Third Secretary should acquaint himself particularly with Persian Gulf questions, which are continually coming up for consideration, and should with a view to acquiring background from time to time be attached to the Resident's staff, or do a tour of the Gulf with him, tnere would seem no objection. There might, in fact, be cie inite advantage in the establishment of personally friendly relations between the staff of the Resident and some individual member of the Legation. Sir Robert Clive will no doubt himself take up the point on his return home next month, while the Resident, to whom a copy of this despatch was sent direct, may in the meantime have expressed some opinion which will assist us in discussing it with the Foreign Office, if it is taken further.r COPY OF P.4315.
