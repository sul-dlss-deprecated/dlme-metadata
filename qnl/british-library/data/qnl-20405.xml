( msm- BBITISH HS3IDEN0T, BDSHIH3, Dated [ - May,1930. I received a private letter from the India Offloe recently saying that yon were leaving for Jeddah shortly, I aa therefore writing this letter to estahlish contaot with you, if I may so put it, as I expeot we shall have lauok official oorrespondenoe with each other in the future. As you know there are many questions at issue between Ihn Saud and Kuwait, Bahrain and other plaoes in the i ersian Gulf and owing to the faot that there are great difficulties in communicating with Ihn 3aud when he is at I^Jd, these matters are frequently dealt with hy the Political Hesldent. I should like to assure you however, that I fully realise that the official channel of communication with Ihn Saud is the E.M.'s Minister at Jeddah and that I will certainly keep you fully informed of all matters that may arise between the Persian Gulf and Nejd and,of course, all my telegrams regarding Nejd affairs to the Colonial Office are automatically repeated to you. My personal view is that it is of little use to write letters to Ihn &amp;aud and the only satisfactory way to deal with him is hy personal interviews. One is then dealing with Ihn Saud himself, hut letters pass through the hands of his hangers on, who do their best to be obstructive if they can. I think the only way to affect any settlement of the long outstanding disputes between Kuwait and Nejd will be to go to see Ibn Saud myself sometime and even then I am afraid that the prospects of a satisfactory settlement CCi. lsettlement are not very great as I shall have very little to bargain with. There is only one matter to which I should like to invite your attention. As you know I arranged last January the surrender of the Mutair and Ajman leaders and trihes to Ihn Saud. One of the conditions of the settlement was that Ihn Saud should pay S, 10,000/- through the Charge d' Affair?., Jeddah on the 5th of March. He has not fulfilled this promise up todate and when pressed 'by Bond he replied that this payment was subject to certain conditions and that he would like to discuss the matter. Now the only condition prescrihed in the agreement was that the rehel leaders and the trihes should he handed over to him. The trihes were shepherded down to the Nejd frontier and subsequently Ihn Saud sent one of his own men to Kuwait and he was authorised 'by the Shaikh of Kuwait to go round to all the Kuwait trihal encampments to see whether any of the rehel tribesmen remained in them. A most exhaustive search was undertaken and Ihn Saud's representative reported to Dickson that he was satisfied that there were no more of the rehel tribesmen in Kuwait territory,vide Kuwait Despatch No.155 dated 21st February,1930,copy forwarded to Jeddah under cover of my endorsement N0.99-S dated 14.3.30.

In continuation of my confidential No, 218 dated 22nd April, I have the honour to submit below some rather interesting items of news which I obtained from Abdur Rahman bin Muharib messenger and right hand nan of Ibrahim bin ArfaJ who visited me yesterday (7th May 1930) and delivered letters from Bin Saud and his master to the Shaikh and myself. H B S . ^ Ibrahim bin Arfaj has been appointed in charge of all Bedouin in North East Arabia roughly from Lina to the sea. He has full authority to settle inter-tribal disputes, and to receive and deal with ccmplaints from the frontier authorities of 'Iraq and Kuwait. He is accompanied by an Alim or Wahabi Eclesiastic of proved knowledge and worth who will act as judge in all matters concerning the Sheria. For the present Ibrahim al ArfaJ will make Hafar al Batin his headquarters. 2. All the Amirs of Nejd have proceeded to the HaJ with H.M.King Bin Saud except the Amir of Qatif and ibn' M'saad, Governor of Hail. 3. Saud ibn Abdullah al-Jaloui acts as Governor of Hassa. 4. The King received ibn M'saad at Hiath just before his departure for Mecca and treated him withmarked consideration* (This appears to contridict tlie report that the person named was in disgrace over the TransJordan affair), 5, After the Ha J Saud bin Abdul Aziz el-Saud (the King) returns and takes over the governorship of Nejd proper*, Abdullah bin Jaloui (rumoured to have been offered Madina) definitely returns also to Hassa after the Haj* 7* The King v/ill summer at Taif and probably also will keep with him his broths]® Mohamed and Abdullah and the ibn Talal and ibn Mitaab of the House of Raschid (state prisoners*)« 8. Faisal al-Duwish, ibn Hathlain, ibn Lami and ibn Humaid were still prosoners in Riath, but were treated wello (Informant had charge of them till quite recently)♦ All were incarcerated inside the great fort at Riath, but in a comfortable houseo Ibn Humaid occupied the upper story and the others the lower rooms of their quarters. By night they v/ere all locked up, by day they could wander about in fsSont of the house and on the verandah, Ibn Humaid was forbidden to speak to the othei&gt;. 9• The four prisoners still wore light chains on their legs, which they could lift up when moving about. 10. On Fridays all go to prayer in the fort mosque &lt;, 11 # Bandar ibn Duwish recently visited Bin Saud &amp; asked to be allowed to return to Arta^fiyeh and settle &lt;L there with Duwish*s laties, but permission was refused. Bandar with all the other members of the Dushan family including all v/omen and children therefore are still in the 'Summan' area and water from Safa, Haba and Wabra. lZ m There has been good recent rain in the 'Summan' area lately; and this has somewhat delayed their move to Hafar, which is Ibrahim bin Arfaj's intention that theyshould do. 13. On 5tlx May the Braih were all concentrated at Hafar with ibn Ashwan and Ali bin Shuairibat of lucky fame# Al-Harb were found camped on the wells when Ibrahim bin Arfaj first arrived but were ordered to remove themselves to the Tawal al Dhafir# It is not known whether this is the same lot which moved up to and are now camped at Safwan;-probably it is. 14. The Awazim are camped at ?/afra, with a few tents at Subaihiyeh. 15. The Ajman as^ previously reported concentrated in the vicinity of Nta in mid-Hassa. 16. On 6th May the writer received a rather v ♦ curiously worded letter from imsha, Faisal al-Duwisl^s wife written at the end of April, in which she stated that she was, by the King's orders, going to Artawiyeh at once with all Duwish's ladies and that al-Duwish was still in Hiath and receiving exceptionally honourable and kind treatment. This news does not fit in very well with the news contained in paragraphs 8, 9, 10 &amp; 11. 17 # it is confirmed that the women-folk of Dhaidan late Shaikh of the Ajman have all been taken to Riath and are there honourably and kindly treated by the Eingo I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, fX-zrv^ 1 ^ Lieut-Col., Political Agent, Kuwait.D # C RESIDENCY. -Pplitical Agency, Kuwait♦ Dated the 13tli May 1930 • Not very long ago it was ruled by the High Coimnissioner in ^raq that I should not address the Royal Air Porce in Baghdad direct. It was also ruled by the Hon , ble the Political Resident that I should not address the High Commissioner's office unless the matter was of extreme urgency. I am now a bit puzzled to know what to do in matters of 'Intelligence Reports' pure and simple, such as my report Ho.227 dated the 8th. 3. Such reports^I believe^are of interest to the Ro^al Air Force but I am refraining from sending copies to them, believing that you do this and forward ms. one of my spare copies to them. 4. Am I correct in my assumption^and am I doing right to send no Intelligence reports to any one but you. You might let me know at your Insure. 5. Behind my above question is of course my desire to have no Special Service Officers knocking about in Kuwait and I do not want the Royal Air Force to say one fine day that because I do not send them sufficient news, they think it necessary to plant one of their owm men on me.

(o^-e^s' s V' ji, ! \) Very many thanks for your i/private letter of May 1, which reached me on May 26. EE am a great 'believer In supplementing official 'by personal relations and. had it in mind that I ought to write to you privately. ¥ou have anticipated me in that. As you will readily understand, l have 'been perpetually 'busy since my arrival here on May 6 and my entry into what is to me a new world. As regards relations with Ihn Saud the situation was explained to me in general terms in London. 1 fully realise that it is a case of adopting whatever procedure is best calculated to secure practical results, 1 agree that the only really satisfactory way to settle important questions with Ibn Saud is to tackle him personally. If in the future as in the past he is willing on occasion to meet our people in the Persian Gulf and Iraq, to discuss questions of primary concern to them, you may he assured that there will 'be no difficulty on my i Colonel H.V.Biscoe.22 V -&gt;1 my side, xiie only thing which is important in that connection is that I should he kept adequately informed, and as quickly as may he. Provision already exists for this. The practical possibility of such interviews may 'be affected 'by various things, e .g., ihn ^aud^s reported intention to stay quite a long time now in the Hejaz and his growing inclination, perhaps stimulated 'by some of his advisers, to suggest that all matters 'between him and His Majesty^ Government should normally he discussed with the diplomatic representative in his country, ^ut I repeat that, iC there are difficulties, they will not he originated or increased hy me. As regards written communications, I lean personally to the view that, unless there are special reasons of urgency or convenience, as for instance when Ihn Saud is much more accessible from your side or the communications directly arise out of matters which are 'being dealt with in personal discussions as ahove, the advantage lies in an increas ing use of Jedda as the channel; not, again, to gratify23 &gt; ^ J SXr grcitify uny pretensions of mine, tut to show Ito Saud ttiat he is toeing treated in the same way, as far as possible, as a civilized Government and to ensure greater uniformity. xhis second matter may be affected by a development of the means of communication. My latest information is -that Ibn Saud's negotiations with the Marconi people for the creation of a system of internal wireless have reached a very advanced stage, although the German Siemens group do not yet seem to have abandoned hope of getting the contract. I am anxious to get this letter off without delay in order to thank you for your kindness in writing to me. I am gradually studying the questions between iiejaz-Nejd and the surrounding countries. I have made little headway so far with some of them, notably the position between Nejd and Koweit. As for the matter of the £10,000, 1 had already made a note of it in Jjondon as a thing to be settled early. I had a preliminary conversation with JJ'uad Hamza about it on May 28 and told him that I intended to take it up with the K-ing at my first business audience. I24 I hope that this will take place on June 4 or 5. Even now that he is in Mecca, Itm Saud is very elusive. He came down here on May 17 specially to receive my credentials tut he disappeared the same evening. at some not too distant date. My present programme is to stay here long enough to get a general grip of things and them,perhaps atout mid-August, to take whatever leave is due to me for this year, not only for my own comfort and convenience but also in order to go over the ground at home more intelligently than I could do during my recent short stay in London on my way from Morocco to Jedda. If you are likely to 'be in England in the autumn (Selous tells me that Mrs.Biscoe has already gone home) we might contrive a meeting, e.g., you would perhaps lunch or dine at my cluh.

CU^juJ (TZ^ aw' Many thanks for your private letter of the 30th May which reached me a few days ago. I am glad that you have tackled Ihn Saud regarding the payment of the i0 f 000. As you suggest he is probably waiting to see what 'Iraq, do about Ibn Mashur. I am at a loss to account for Ibn Saud's statement that he is not willing to meet me. 1 do not think it can be on personal grounds, we parted on very friendly terms last January and he subsequently wired asking His Majesty's Government to allow me to be present at the meeting with King faisal, but was told that time did not permit of discussion of Persian Gulf questions on that occasion. As I have not seen him since and he subsequently sent a present of an Arab mare, it is difficult to surmise what reasons he can now advance for reiusing to meet me. Dickson who knows him well is inclined to think that he does not want to be tackled on the subject of the Kuwait blockade which he has relmposed with his former vigour and has an uneasy conscience about the ten thousand pounds. On Sir Andrew Hyan,K.C.I. .G., J eddah ? f28 r/ ~ A - P' f^ii On the other hand, Dickson professes to have heard ruaours that the Shaikh of Kuwait has written to iton Saud saying that he would have gives greater latitude to Ihn Saud's agent to search Kuwait territory, etc* had it not heen for the British# I do not know if there is any truth in this, hut it is difficult to follow the workings of the Arah raind or to keep pace with their isaohinations. I'he blockade is undouhtelly hitting Kuwait very hard, hut if the Shaikh persists in adopting an entirely subservient attitude towards Ihn Saud, it is really difficult for me to do any thing for him. The transfer of the Hejaz Air Force appears to have come in the nick of time.- There is no doubt in my mind that the Air Ministry did not exercise sufficient care in selecting the right type of man. I went up to Simla last month and saw Sir Geoffrey ^almond and he told me that he knew kamilton and that he should not have been selected for work ot that kind Prior, the Political Agent in Bahrain, tells me that he has seen lowe and that he seems to him quite the wrong type of man tooi The change to Jeddah may improve matters but it seems to me that until the Chief Pilot is given some disciplinary power over the others and the right stamp of man selected, trouble is bound to occur. However, you will doubtless see them when they arrive and be able to form your own oonclusions bettor than I can.-3- I am sorry to say 1 shall not 'be going home this summer and so shall be unahle to accept your kind invitation to a moating. I hope to go home for S months next summer and if you are in England then we must certainly try and arrange to meet.61/14 61/22. Telegram From To Repeated 33 p. High CormnisB ioner, Eagiidad. H. M's.

I had intended to return to the subject at earliest favourable opportunity, and without admitting any connection between it, and the return of Ibn Mashhur to maie use of information in telegram from Baghdad Ho.238 to Colonial Office on which I have hesitated to take sapExa seperate action without your instructions. In view of King Faisal's offer should I postpone further action as regards £ 10,000 and confine myself to informing the Hedjaz Government (1) of that offer and (2) of position regarding Ibn Mashhur? and may I assume if Ibn Saud agrees to pay £ 30,000 it will also cover Koweit share of £ 10,000 hitherto in question? I know too little of the history oi the claims to estimate the prospect of the acceptance of King Faisal's offer, but ccndidering Ibn Saud's present temper towards Iraq, and his financial straits, I shall be surprised if he produces£30,000. He may also resent suggestion Sfcdaagix that promise which he gave on -Lupin- regarding Ibn Mashhur is not considered sufficient. His Majesty may be coming to Jeddah next week. I should therefore be grateful for early instruct- - ions. Eyan.

It was to represent advance payment on account of Iraq claims which are estimated at £ 70,000. King Faisal's offer to accept £ 30,000 in full settlement in no way affects Ibn Saud's undertaking to pay £ 10,000 on account to Y/hich he should be held, whether he accepts King Faisal f s offer or not.

On the receipt of Baghdad telegram ITo .SSl to Colonial Office, I thought it advisable to make telephone communication with Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs about Ibn Mashhur this morning without awaiting further instructions. I said that Iraq Government influenced by High Commissioner were doing everything to promote return of Ibn Mashhur to this country. I understood that King Faisal had written to Ibn Saud on June 14th suggesting despatch to Ibn l/jashhur of letter conveying pardon promised on board 'Lupin'. Mashhur tried to get permission to go to Syria. This had been refused, but in view of his desire to go there, despatch of pardon at an early date would be advantageous. Pending instructions as to degree of pressure to bear usefully in connection with question of £ 10,000 I reminded Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs that I had been awaiting fulfilment of promise which I had understood King to have given me on June 11th, He said today that King had given orders for payment. He hoped it would be made within a week or at the furthest a fortnight. I made no reference to King Faisal^ offer to accept £ 30,000 in full settlement. I think it best to leave this between the two Kings at present. I now expect to see Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs on July 7th.i If you approve of action so far I will continue on the same 1ines i Foregoing refers to my telegram No.90: -RYAN- Post copy forwarde to the Political Agent, Kuwait.

The enclosed draft letter addressed to King Ibn Sa'ud has accord- ingly'been prepared. Sir Francis Humphrys approved the draft before his departure and directed that it should be sent to you for communication either to His Majesty or to the Minister for Foreign Affairs at your dis cretion. He thought it possible that you might prefer to make the com munication an oral one, merely handing over a copy of the list of incidents enclosed with the draft. The list has, therefore, been translated into Arabic and Arabic and English versions are enclosed. 3.

Letter erom H. M. ? s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, No. 158, dated the 1st jlily 1930. With reference to my telegram Nos. 94 and 95 of June 30, I have the honour to state that Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, the Hejaz-Nejd Minister Designate in London left for ,his post to-day, taking the Khedivial S. S. Taif ' as far as Suez. I gave a small dinner party in his honour last evening, in the course of whicmhe said that he expected to stay about a fortnight in Egypt and would go on to London via Marseilles. 2. The record of Sheikh Hafiz Wahba is so well known to you that it is unnecessary for me to say anything, of his antecedents. I have not seen enough of him to have formed any personal estimate of his present out look. I give with reserve the following impressions derived from reports which have reached me :— (a) He would be glad to see much-.closer relations betwen Great Britain and this country on terms favourable to the latter. (I) He is hostile to the 44 Syrian Party ', the protagonists in which are Sheikhs Fuad Hamza and Yussef Yassin, and is specially hostile towards the latter. (c) His own position vis-a-vis of the King il probablv that the latter values his opinions but frequently finds them unpalatable. He himself finds the Kins? difficult., He told one of tmy informants nevertheless that a special code had been arranged which would enable him to 'Communicate with Ibn Saud independently of the Syrians. {d) He do&amp;s not think that the King is disposed to break with the feynans at present, perhaps for reasons connected with ultimate aspirations in regard to Syria. Itds suggested even that Ibn Saud hopes one day to secure tie throne of that country for one of his sons. ,^ ent ^n in this connection #iat reports have beef* rife for SstOT of ^ th !

I enclose with this despatch a list giving briefly the facts of the principal incidents of which the 'Iraq Government complain. 3. Your Majesty will observe that some of the individuals mentioned have stated that they were bearing letters from Your Majesty or Your Majesty's agents to tribal Shaikhs in 'Iraq and that one of them produced a letter bearing Your Majesty's seal addressed to 'Abdul Razzaq ibn Hallaf, an 'Iraq Shaikh of the Dhafir tribe, who was at the time encamped at Rafa 'iyah, near Basrah. The authoritative tone of the letter, conclud ing as it does with very definite threats of punishment, cannot be reconcil ed with the position of 'Abdul Razzaq ibn Hallaf as a subject of His Majesty King Faisal. Apart however from the surprising tone of this letter, Sir Francis Humphrys desires me to refer Your Majesty to Article 5 of the Bahra Agreement which reads :— ' The Governments of 'Iraq and Najd may not correspond with the Chiefs and Shaikhs of tribes subject to any other State on official or political matters.' The 'Iraq Government have, therefore, good grounds for protesting against the despatch of this letter. Sir Francis Humphrys feels that some misunderstanding must have occurred, as he is convinced that Your Majesty would not have authorised the despatch of a letter of this nature in the circumstances which I have described. 4. Your Majesty will also readily appreciate that this unauthorised entry of subordinate Najdi officials into 'Iraq territory in the manner re corded in the note enclosed with this despatch, is contrary to all interna tional usage.and liable to embarrass the good relations at present existing between 'Iraq and Najd. I accordingly feel confident that Your Majesty, recognising the validity of the 'Iraq Government's complaints, will not fail to cause urgent orders to be issued preventing the repetition of such viola tion of the 'Iraq frontier. Enclosure 3 to Serial No. (63). Note on Recent Violations of the 'Iraqi Frontier by Najdi officials. 1. During March, a party of Najdi tax collectors under the command of a certain Mutlaq ibn Zamil, raided one hundred sheep from A1 'Asi ibn Hasan of the Zabinna, a section of the Dahamshah Amarat. A1 'Asi was at that time camped at A1 Sahn, 20 miles north-west of Ma'aniyah and about 12 miles within 'Iraq territory. 2. Later in the month this same Mutlaq ibn Zamil re-entered 'Iraq territory and visited bedouin camps in 'Iraq territory at Aidhah, Tukha- did, and Bakar to collect taxes in the name of the Najd Government and sent messages for the same purpose to Dhafir and Shammar camps at Jahama and Tuqaiyid. 3. On the 3Gth April, one Abaid al Naturi, a man of Ibrahim ibn Arfaj, came to Julaida where he met the Administrative Inspector of the Southern Desert Area. He asked for permission to enter 'Iraq territory to visit certain tribes and to search for camels belonging to Najdi tribes which he alleged were in the possession of tribes camped in 'Iraq. This request was refused as being contrary to the arrangements in force for the settlement of further tribal incidents. At the same time the Adminis trative Inspector undertook to investigate any complaints which Ibrahim ibn Arfaj might have cause to make regarding raids made into Najd by tribesmen from 'Iraq. This man, al Naturi, stated openly that he was the bearer of letters from King 'Abdul 'Aziz to Dhafir Shaikhs in 'Iraq. 4. Early in May, one Ghazi al Salih came to Shibrum in 'Iraq terri tory claiming to have been despatched by the Governor of Hail to collect \54 certain camels from 'Iraq tribesmen. He had a brawl with a bedouin herdsman from whom he demanded milk. Ghazi al Salih seized the herdsman's rifle and camel. The latter was able, however, to recover his property through the desert police at Sulman. 5. On the 16th May, three men believed to be subordinates of Ibrahim ibn Arfaj entered 'Iraq territory and visited Rafa'iyah and Chabda with letters to Shaikhs of the Dhafir tribe. One of these letters was addressed , to 'Abdul Razzaq ibn Hallaf of the Dhafir, an 'Iraqi Shaikh who was camped at the time at Rafa'iyah on 'Iraq territory. A copy of the letter, which bore the seal of His Majesty King 'Abdul 'Aziz al Sa'ud, is attached hereto. Enclosure 4 to Serial No. (63). Translation. Lettek from King Ibn Sa'ud, to 'Abdulrazzaq Ibn Hallaf, dated the 3ed Dhul Hijjat, 1348. God has been gracious towards the Moslems by revealing to them the Islamic faith and enabling them to adopt it, whereby they have tasted happy life which combines the good of this world and that of the next. The sinful elements have brought about trouble and dissention among the Moslem and God has dealt them his punishment. May God be thanked for He alone has given victory to his hosts and defeated the confederates, I see that there is spreading about in the desert an evil (rumour '?) to the effect that we had fought ' those ' only because of their tenacious hold to their religion. May God forbid that we should have fought them on that account. Tenacity in religious belief accompanied by discretion is most strongly admired by us. We have fought them only on account of contra vention of religion and the Sharia'. There are also some who imagine that the Sharia' and the religion have been upheld only thanks to five bedouins of Mutair and 'Ataiba. This can be imagined only by false ones and ene- mies of the faith and of Moslems. God be praised for the ' leadership of Moslems ha^ at all times exerted itself only for the support of reli gion, the upholding of the Sharia', and the suppression of those who act to the contrary seeking assistance from God. Now, God be praised, I Shf among the Moslems those who hold fast to and main- tern their religion and their ' hijra ' (flight) ; while to those of the Moslems who act contrary to this or commit any act contrary to t e le stnV anr&amp;e ?

These (who fail to comply) we shall deem as enemies and seek brod s assistance against them.

To:- His Majesty King Ibn Sa'ud. A/C. There are certain matters on v/hich I wish to write to Your Majesty unofficially, as Your Majesty's sincere friend, 'before I proceed on lea/ve to England next week, I have heard that Your Majesty has written to His Majesty King Faisal suggesting that negotiations should he opened between Your Majesty's Government and the Government of 'Iraq for an extradition agreement and that the Bon Voisinage Treaty should not he signed until such an agreement had. been conclud.ed. I suggest to Your Majesty that, if the Bon Voisinage Treaty is signed and diplomatic relations are established between the two countries with the free and friendly exchange of views that such relations imply, the difficult problem of extradition will more easily be solved. If however the signing of the Bon Voisinage Treaty is to be delayed until agreement has been reached on the subject of extra dition, as Your Majesty suggests, then I think that there is grave danger that further progress will be delayed and that the fruits of the Lupin Conferance, of which I treasure such pleasant recollections, will be thrown away. I feel sure that this would be a cause of as great regret to Your Majesty as to myself. Your56 Your Majesty will remeiaber that at our last interview on board the Patrick Stewart I promised to do rny best to secure the fulfilment of Your Majesty's wishes as regards recognition as King of the Hijaz and the return of Ibn Mashhur. The first has been achieved. As regards the second, King Faisal tells me that he has now after much pressure persuaded Ibn Mashhur to return to Eajd provided an assurance of pardon and sympathetic treat ment is received from Your Majesty; and that he has written to Your Majesty to this effect. I trust that Your Majesty will not disappoint your friend by delaying the signature of the Bon Voisinage Agreement. I much regret that there has been a delay about sending the souvenir which I promised Your Majesty should be despatched to Jiddah as early as possible trom Ii»ngland, Arrangements are now being made to send to ^four ^^ajesty a Marconi wireless apparatus instead of the wireless sets originally intended, as these are no longer obtainable in England. I hope that this will be acceptable to Your Majesty. I shall be in England till the end of September, and if Your Majesty desires to reply to this letter I shall be grateful if the letter could be addressed to Baghdad, where it could be translated before it is forwarded to London, I send Your Majesty my sincerest good wishes for the continued prosperity of your reign and shall never forget our friendship.

This week I saw the treaty of T Iraq with Great Britain, and I found it to be of decided-^worth, but according to what vie have read in the telegrams, it has created much opposition in 'Iraq, and one does not know whether it will be ratified by the Iraq Parliament, or meet the fate of Ja * far Pasha al-'Askari's treaty of 1927, 5.

With reference to your letter No. 1717]583[83 of Sth August 1930 (12-3-1349) enclosing a memorandum from the Government of Iraq concerning eertaiii aggressions attrilmted to certain Nejd officials, I have the honour to inform Tour Excellency of the following r— 1. The allegations made in the Iraq memorandum as to the property looted by Mutl'aq ibn Zamel from al Asi ibn Hasan will be investigated, and when the crime is proved the looted property will be returned to its owner and the criminalr Will be punished as he deserves, 2. As to the other allegations therein mentioned regarding certain Nejd officials crossing the Iraq frontier, I can divide that (question) into two parts. Firstly ;• entering Iraq territories with the intention of getting into touch with tfie Iraq officials or of meeting the Administrative Inspector of the Iraq side with a view to coming to a mutual understanding on certain unimportant matters. Secondly : Officials entering for some other reasons. As to the first part, I do not think it calls for a protest or (should cause) any displeasure as it is a legal action and] carried out with the sole intention of aettling certain uhimportant matters as quickly as possible. As to the second part, most careful investigation will be made with a view tp ascertaining the reasons for which it was done ; because, as is well known, His Majesty's Government (the Hejaz Government) protect this principle by all means in their power and cannot agree to accept its non-observance. 3. There remains for me to explain to you the truth concerning the letter alleged to have been sent to Abdurrazzaq ibn Halaf. The copy sent by you to me, which supposed to have been despatched by His Majesty the King, is a true copy, but His Majesty the King never intended to send the letter to Tbn Halaf, neither did he want it to be sent to him in the Iraq territories. The origin of this letter is that His Majesty my Lord the King on his return from the Lupin Conference, promised to order that raiding against Iraq should be prevented and to declare that the situation between Nejd and Iraq was very good. So he wrote from this lette r several thousands of copies to be distributed amongst all Bedouins and more especially (amongst those) in the vicinity of the frontiers. His Majesty had given some copies of that letter without mentioning the name of K any addressee. It appears that the messenger who carried that letter wrote the name of Ibn Halaf on it, and perhaps he presumed that Ibn Halaf was in Nejd territory, ao he addressed it in his name. This is the letter which you have received. I hope this explanation of the matter will suffice.

Sir, Reference my intelligence report No*304 dated B7tla September and last two diaries, I have the honour to report the following movements of Tribal Shaikhs etc# (a) Shaikh Mishal ibn Twala of the Shammar Aslam who has been camped for some days past at Jahrah with apparty of his adherents, (some 50 tents) left for Hoffuf in Hassa last week, in order to pay his respects to Abdullah ibn Jaloui, the Governor there. Shaikh Mishal was accompanied by two men, and left his brother in charge of the camp. Ibn Twala and party who are Nejd subjects arrived from *Iraq a fortnight ago ywhere accord ing to annual custom they proceeded to purchase supplies before the rains set in. (b) Shaikh Hantush al-Suwait returned last week from his visit to Hoffuf and called on the Political Agent on 27th October 1930. Among the items of interest which he reported were the following:- (i) Ibn Jaloui received him well and pre sented him with 100 dollars, a bhisht and an abbah, also gave abbahs to each of his 5 followers®... ^ 111 ^ (ii) Ibn Jaloui would not list to his complaint against the Khalidi who had stolen the camel which Captain Glubb had given him (maitioned in diary fac period 15th to 50th September) on the grounds that ibn Arfaj's tt alim w had given a decision, and he could not upset such decision. (iii) Ibn Jaluui^ severity and had dealing^ was even more true than y^usual report made out. In particular he was very hash these days in his dealings with the Ajman # Civ) The Awazim who had hoped to be the spoilt favourites of Ibn Jaloui, as a reward for their work against the Akhwan last year were being systematically kept in their place, and were in no way encouraged to come up to Hoffuf. They felt this neglect rather badly and were bitter in their com plaints to him (Hantush). (v) The new fort at NTA was making good progress and was more in the nature of a walled enclosure round a small town than a fojirt. Several wells lay inside the building. jy-riM- tux-ee/i (vi) Eight lorry loads reached Hoffuf while he (Hantush) was there, bringing new Hejazi officials for Qatif, Jubail and Ojair. These he understood would take over their duties in immediate future. Cvii) Ibn Arfaj was at Jarriya and was likely to remain therej^ for sometime. (viii) Some good rain had fallen in North Hassa and in Awazim country. (c) The Kuwait tribes (Araibdar) both at Jahara and Kuwait are preparing to more out into the hinter land, as fair rain has been reported from the vicinity of the Bartin, and in the southern112 Neutral Area. The exodus will probably take place after the 5th November. (d) A little rain fell in Kuwait on the night of the 23/24th October, but not enough to do goodo (e) H.M.King Bin Saud has sent letters (received 25th October 1930) to the Shaikh of Kuwait, agreeing to the latter^ proposals regarding the handing back of the 52 Nejd camels etc recognized among the tribes of Kuwait# A separate report will follow about this. The King^ letter was most cordial, and his open ins tructions to Ibn Arfaj to fall into line, passed through the Shaikh of Kuwaiti hands for delivery. Other letters were also received from Ibn Jaloui and Ibn M* saad. I have the honour to be Sir Youc most obedient servant Lieut-Col Political Agent, Kuwait.T R AITS LAT ION .

No.23/5/16 of August 12th (20.3.1349) to His Excellency Sir Andrew Ryan concerning the memorandum from the 'Iraq. Government relating to certain aggressions said to have 'been made 'by Nejd Officials, I have the honour to explain to you the facts of the complaint against the actions of Mutlaq. az-Zamel as follows; Mutlaq. agreed with (-followed ? ) al ^si as Jamish 'behind al Hazul, and not, as mentioned 5 'near as-Sakr'. Al ^si had in mind to go with his sheep to the westward at a time when strict orders had 'been given to the effect that no sheep were allowed to 'be sent to the westward. Mutlaq. informed him that he should go hack with his sheep or wait until he had obtained per mission from the Amis of Hail for him. He refused, said the sheep were not his, left them with the men of Amir Ibn Musa'id and went away. Their number is ninety-five. Later Amir Abdul-Aziz Ihn Musa*id received a letter from a man of Mashhad named Mohammed Ma* la to say that the sheep were his property. The Amir then gave orders for them to he handed to the agent of the petitioner 'by name Fahad al Khalid. The sheep Yfere delivered to him and he sold them and remitted the money to the owner. You will see from the ahove explanation that the matter was quite other than as represented to the 'Iraq, Government and that it was nevertheless settled in the way I have explained.

The Captain said, «I want to tell you a'bout the matter* The British Government have Informed your Crovernnent of the difficulty arising In the way of driving away the rebels 'by force if they have women and children. ¥e have 'been some tinie working about them and itoenever we drive them from one direction they go another. I have asked the Govemnent to allow us to beat theia as it is impossible that they will go away from the frontiers without beating, but until now they have not allowed us to beat themf because they are accompanied by women and children. Some time ago they cam© to the frontiers and we drove them out; so they went to Bharabin within your frontiers. Then Al-Farin came and attacked them. Al-Faren was not in possession of a big force, but owing to the fact that the rebels had become mentally weak, as far as military measures are concerned, they could not withstand him. Had Al-Farin pursued them he ^ould have finished them. Then aA-Dawish sant to me Muiiemmed Ibn Badr with some others to request us to allow them refuge and to accpet them as subjects of ours. Ad-Dawish and his people had already crossed the ♦Iraq frontiers. But I answered them that it was impossible to allow them refuge. So he went back. I then wrfcte to the aovernment a second time and stated that nothing would be of any use except beating them. The Government them ordered me to g ive them an ultination. So I send round for M-Dawish and Ibn Hithlain who came to this tent and I told them that they had to go away from the f Iraq, frontiers and .after two days anyone found there would be driven away by force. They complied with the order and went a way* It appears that they got news about you so they went in the northern direct- ion. I then pursued them with armoured cars today and found that they had left Al ~Jahra near Kowait. I therefore informed the British Political Resident there about them. 1 tried to stop them •but I did not find Ad-Dawlsh or any tig one.

' NSJD W The Meeting at Khabari and Dnha « On Monday, 20th Sha'ban, (January 20) six aeroplanes arrived in the afternoon bKlnging the Chief political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Colonel Biscoe, the Political Agent in Kowait, Colonel Dickon, the assistant Commander of the Air Force in # Iraq., Commander (sic) Burnett, accompanied 'by some translators, clerks and servants# They were also accompanied by Sheikh Hafiz ¥ahba who had heen to Kowait and received instructions fwaa His Majesty the King to accompany the British Mission hy aeroplane. The Mission encamped in a place near His Majesty's Camp# All possible arrangements for the comfort of the mission were made in camp. Kegotiations then took place from EOth Shaman ( 20th January) to the g^th Sha'han (27th January) between the British onn one side and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba and Yusuf Yasin under the guidance of His Majesty on the other side# Many questions were raised for discussion and the results were successful* The British Government fulfilled their promise as to the handing over of the interned criminals and returning the imprisoned rebels. It was agreed that an aeroplane should fly on 28th Sha'ban (January 28th) td bring Ad~Dawidlj, Ibn Hithlain and Ibn Lami from Kowait to the camp, and that aeroplanes and tanks would drive along Al-Ujman and Mutair with their property until they entered Hejd frontiers. His Majesty sent at once some cars to carry some of the women end children of Ujman and Mutair from Kowait. On 28th Sha'ban (January 28) at 11 a.m. an aeroplane came to the camp bringing Colonel Dickson and the Captain of the ship in which the criminals were. It also brought Faisal Al-Dawish, Naif Abu al-Kilab and Jaser Ibn Lamio Colonel Dickson and the Captain of the ship were honoured by seeing His Majesty. Then permission was asked for the three criminal tolu U 133 to enter and they were allowed to come in* They did so and greeted His Majesty and after coffee was served Colonel Dickson and his friend asked for leave to go. When they went His Majesty turned towards Dawish and said, 'Are you not afraid of God the Almighty?' 'What has caused you to commit such disgraceful deeds?' 1 He wept and said, tt I have committed all disgraceful deeds and nothing is more disgraceful than to be punished in this way 'before all people of Kejd w # Then Naif Abu al-Kilab spoke showing his love for His Majesty. Ibn Lami did the same. His Majesty did not like to keep them too long for reproach, as it is of no use. He ordered that they should be placed in a special tent and being afraid some people might attack them, he ordered a guard of troops to be placed around them to prevent people from coming near then. His Majesty then ordered that they should be sent by car to Riadh, where they are still living in s afety. Their followers Al-Ujman and Mutair were led by the aeroplanes and tanks to the Nejd frontier where they were met by one of His Majesty's detachments under the leadership of Abdurrahman Al-Tibeishi and thence to the camp of His Majesty who saw their chiefs and reassured them and gave them orders which they accepted and obeyed. This was the end of the trouble.' 135 leaving Before/the 'iMig, frontiers we mat the 'Ireci Ooirern- raent for helping ■as to Bwchase a quantity of benzine from *Ira&lt;i, for the arrangeiaonte they made for trenaporting it to Al -Abld» and for allowing us to use their telegraph stations for our affairs.

After sunset a oar from Kowait oame carrying Abdul-Mahsen au-Nafisi and Nazal of the Amir ®f Kowait's people and Parhan of the Folitioal Agent's people in Kowait. On Friday, 10th Shaman (January 10) a wonderful event ooourrede The place where we roam about contains many gasselle. His Majesty occasionally feels Inclined to go ahead of the troops after breakfast and drive for game. It happened on this day that His Majesty went far out hunting in his oar followed by two or three cars. The land was so vast and flat that a traveller could hardly tell last from West. After two hours His Majesty saw fine gazelle and shot four of them one after the other, but when he was trying to shoot the fifth, he saw a large party of people who he thought might be a part of the troops and he was afraid the gazelle would go towards them and then it would be difficult to shoot it. So His Majesty ordered the driver to go in the direction of the party so that the gazelle would go far from them. The driver did as he was143 he was told and went past until he enabled His Majesty to shoot the gazelle* Then His Majesty found that the party had women and sheep, and being aware that his troops had no women and sheep, he became sure that the people were of the rebels. His Majesty at that time had with him only Abdullah Ibn Hasan, Yusif Yasin, Doctor Medhat Shaikh aWrdh and the driver Saddiq and two slaves of His Ma^esty^ on the sides of the car. His Ka^esty looked baok and saw the car of his son, the Amir Mohammed, and his brother, the ^mir Khalid and his cousin, Faisal* The Mir asked for his father^ permission to attack the enemy, but His Majesty refused and sent out a car with a man from Mutair to find out about the party. The men came baok and said they were people from Al-U^man and Mutair running away from Ibn Sard's forces. Then His Majesty returned to his forces and ordered people to get into the oars and ordered the cars to proceed. His Majesty found the £mir Mohammed getting ready to take command of the oars, so he tried to stop him but the son insisted and thus a struggle arose between the father and the son which resulted in the, success of the boy, who commanded the troops against the rebels. His Majesty ordered all the cars to be sent with the nearest forces to join the battle. He then went himself to the place of the battle and found that it was finished, that all the men of the enemy were killed and that only women and children were left. Most of the women happened to know His Majesty so they came weeping to him. His heart was touched for them and he ordered them to be carried all in cars. One woman came to His Majesty and wept and said that shesaid that she lost her daughter. So he ordered a oar to take her round to look for her child until she found her, n the end of the battle His Majesty ordered all the troops to take their places and the loot to be distributed amongst them. At night Turk! Ibn Madhi came from the camp of Al-Abld bringing a letter oommunieating a telegram from the High Commissioner for Uraq to say that he had interned Faisal ad-Da^ish, Naif Ibn Hithlain and Jasir Ibn Lami in a British ship.

I wish to make it clear to Your Excellency that when His Majesty my King was entrusted to consider and settle the question of compensations claimed for the subjects of the tv^ro governments, the amount of compensations claimed for the fIra ^ trihes was 70,000 Guineas, when the question of arbitration on the subject was entrusted to His Majesty he deducted from the compensations claimed for his subjects the maximum of what your esteemed government may claim as a compensation, and, being anxious to express the feelings of amity and friendship which His Majesty and the •Iraq Government keep to His Majesty the King of Hijaz and Hajd and his government. His Majesty decided to make the sum 30,000 guineas only. His Majesty did not make this reduction except in the belief that the esteemed Najd Government will not raise a claim for any compensation for their subjects. Therefore the' 'Iraq Government regret for their being unable to consider the statement claimed for which was forwarded with your letter in question, and they are sure that His Majesty the King of Hijaz andMajd will reciprocate the feelings of amity and friendship of His Majesty the King of 1 Iraq and his government and forego the claims of compen* sation of His Majesty's subjects, which have been deducted from the original sum of 70,000 Guineas, I am sure that your esteemed government will now hasten to pay the remaining sum of our claims which amounts to 20,000 Guineas, I am glad to sei^e this opportunity to express to Your Excellency, Monsieur le MinistEe, my profound appreciation and respect^.\iA 158 Letter from the Council of Ministers, Baghdad, to H.B.M's High Commissioner for Iraq, Baghdad, No. 3806, dated the 16th December, 1930. As Your Excellency is awai'e, at their meeting on 1st December, the Council of Ministers resolved to refer to me the letter of the Minister for Foreign Affairs relating to the que.stion of compensation in respect of ^raq-Hajd frontier raids, for settlement of this question. The letter contained tm points s . (a) Demand by Najd Governmeny paymen t of 20,500 Guineas as compensation to Najd tribes. (b) A suggestion that part of the sum of 10,000 Ouineass depo sited -with His Britannic Majesty^ Minister at Jiddah should be given to Kuwait. In regard to the first point, the 'Iraq Government have communicated to Your Excellency, in previous correspondence, their view to the effect that 'Iraqi claims, according to lists kept at the Ministry of Interior, exceed £70,000, but that His Majesty the King did not like to award more than 30,000 only because of his desire to demonstrate ' Iraq* s good will towards Hajd and in ttie belief on his part that Najd will not claim compensation for her subjects. When at the Lupin Conference His Majesty King Ibn Sa'ud left to the discretion of His Majesty King Faisal the settlement of the question of compen sation, it was understood that the settlement would cover the claims of both parties, and it was on this basis (? basis of this understanding) that His Majesty gave his award which in volves such a great sacrifice on the part of 'Iraq. Had His Majesty King Faisal been av^are that the intention of His Majesty King Ibn Sa^ud by leaving decision in the question of compensation to him was that he should determine the amount of the 'Iraqi claims only, and that Iraq would be faced with a counter claim from Kajd, His Majesty would not have given the award reducing the 'Iraqi claims to less than half. Therefore, the ♦Iraq Government consider that the claimsnow put forward by Najd is contrary to the understanding come to at the lupin Conference, and that it is the intention of the Najd Government to go back to the position -which existed prior to the meeting of that conference, namely that of each part insisting on his right to ^claim compensation for all losses sustained by his subjects. If such be the intention (? of the Hajd Government) the 'Iraq Government are prepared to consider as having never come about the understanding hitherto reached concerning compensation, and to agree to the question being referred to the tribunal under Article 2 of the £ B^hra Agreement. As regards the suggestionjfor the payment to Kuwait of £3,000 out of the sum of £10,000 deposited with His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Jiddah, the 'Iraq Government consider that this is a question for the Hajd Government alone to decide, 'Iraq is claiming a net compeneation of £30,000, and if the Najd Government accept this claim it is for them to decide to pay the whole or part of the amount of £10,000 to the 'Iraq Government against the latter 1 s claim. Please accept, etc..P.Z.271. ENCLOSURE IN COLONIAL OFFICE COVERING LETTER 180 No • 79006/j/30 Dated 10th January i9 31» 79006/J/30* Downing Street^ iOth January 1931. Please refer to our official le tter No.79 4^ i /30 of the 31st of Decern'ber aloout the proposal of the Iraq Prime Minister to visit Jeddah in connection with the proposed Bon Voisinage Agreement and Extradition Treaty 'between the Governments of Imq and Heja2-Nejd, In the second paragraph of that letter we promised you a further letter on the subject of the Iraq-Nejd raid claims. The correspondence enclosed with our letter No• 79006/J/30 of the 2nd of January, discloses the attitude adopted by the Iraq Government in connection with the two outstanding claims questions namely;- (1) The Nejd counter-claim of £20,500, including claims amounting to more than £4,000 for alleged losses incurred as a result of Royal Air Force operations; and (2) The allocation of the £10,000 already paid 'by Ibn saud to . t His Majesty's Representative at Jeddah, As regards (l) you will see that the Iraq Government have rejected the counter-claim in principle and we are, therefore, presumably, relieved of the necessity for saying anything to the Hejaz Government about liiat portion of the claim which deals with losses said to have been caused by Roayl Air Force operation As, however, we pointed out in the second paragraph of our letter of the 3ist of December, Nuri proposes, if he goes to Jeddah, to discuss the general questions of claims, and we think it might be advisable to ensure that in spite of the Iraq Govern ments declared attitude towards the counter-claim, nothing is said which might commit us in any way in connection with these claims in respect of alleged damage by aircraft. We would accordingly propose, unless you see any objection, to instruct the High Commissioner to see that Nuri goes to Jeddah primed with the knowledge that His Majesty* s Government would in no case ac cept liability for loss or damage sustained by hostile bodies in F.A, Warner Esq.161 the course of operations undertaken for the protection of Iraqi and Koweiti nationals in circumstances similar to those which obtained during the Akhwan aggressions in j.928 and 1929, In this connection attention is invited to the Air Ministry's letter, No•S.28125/Part IS/ S.6. of the 13th of October, a copy of which was sent direct to the Foreign Office. As regards (2), you will see from the penultimate paragraph of their letter to the High Commissioner that the Iraq Government affirm that the allocation of the £10,000 is a matter for the Nejd Government alone. It will also be observed from the last paragraph of the note to miad Hamza that they request payment of 'the remaining sum of our claims which amounts to 20&gt;000 guineas', thus presupposing that the #iole of the £10,000 already paid belongs to Iraq, There now seems little prospect of obtaining Iraq's acquiescence in the proposed division of the £10,000, which, as you will remember, is £7 ^000 to Iraq and £3,000 to Koweit# But, although their concur* rence is desirable, it is we think, by no means essential, ]?rom the penultimate paragraph of the King's letter to Colonel Biscoe of the 27th of January, 1930 which forms the enclosure to the latter 1 s Confidential despatch of the 31st January 1930 (see Foreign Office Confidential Print, Eastern, Arabia - Ho, E «108l /i /91 of the 26th of February 1930) and also from Itead Hamza 1 s letter to Hope Gill of the 9th of September a copy of which accom§ianied your letter Ko,B,5433/i/a of the 21st of October J.930&gt; it is, in our view, abundantly clear that the £10,000 already paid is the advance payment which Ibn S^ud at the preliminary negotiations with Colonel Bisooe in January 1930, promised to make in respect of Iraq and Koweit claims. In this case there is no question of asking Iraq's permission to divide the sum in question between Iraq and Koweit, but only of seeking their concurrency in the proportion of that sum which we|propose to hand over to them, and in view of the unhelpful attitude which they have adopted in the matter, we are disposed to think that we should now take things into our own hands and make the division as originally proposed, i.e, ^7»000 to Iraq and £3,000 to Koweit. We shall be glad to have your views as to this. You will notice that in tiie letters to Sir Francis Humphrys andn -K 162 iju^d Hdmza the terms 'guineas' is frequently used instead of 'pounds The point is probably not inrnr^-i-ar,-!- mportant but we propose to call the High Commissioner's attention to it Whpn it wnen addressing any communication to him on this subject. We do not think, however, that our reply to the High Commissioner regarding Hun's proposal to visit Jeddah need be held up pending consideration of ttiese two questions and we should, therefore, oe glad unless you see any objection if you would let us have a separate reply to our letter of the S^st of December. Any instruc tions which we may desire to send to Humphrys about the claims questions can be sent to Baghdad later in time to catch Nuri before nis departure for Jeddah which, so far as we are aware, cannot take place until the end of this month at the earliest.

My dear Blaxter, Many thanks for your letter of the xOth January Ho.79006/j/30 about claims 'between Iraq and the Neja^-Nejd, As regards the question of the claims against the Royal Air Force, we agree that it would be a good thing that Nuri Pasha should know that His Majesty f s Government would not be prepared to entertain these claims. We think, however, that it would be best that, in speaking to Nuri pasha. Sir F.Humphrys should only refer to the attitude of His Majesty's Government in respect of these specific claims,'and should not use the vaguer language regarding such claims in general which you use in the penultimate sentence of tfte third paragraph of your letter (at the top of the third page) and which the Air Ministry are in ihe penultimate paragraph of their letter No•3.28125/Part 4/s.6 of the 13th October. £10,000 As to the question of the ten thousand pounds, we had reached the same conclusion as you independently, before me received your letter. It appears to us that His Majesty's Government are under a definite obligation to pay a part of this sum to Koweit. It was to His Majesty^ Government that King Ibn Saud gave the undertaking to pay this ten thousand pounds, and they appear to be clearly en* titled to proceed to the discharge of their obligation towards Koweit without further reference to the Hejazi Government. As the Iraqi Government appear from Huri Pasha's letter of the 16th Decem ber to Sir F.Humphrys, enclosed in Colonial office letter No. 79006/^/30 of the 2nd January, to be now prepared to accept either a part o^ the whole of the ten thousand pounas, and in spite of several requests have not expressed views as to the proposed allo cation between Iraq and Koweit, there seems 00 objection to our paying over the three thousand pounds to Koweit and the seven thousand pounds to Iraq at once. He would then inform the He ja^i Government how much has been paid to each, ^nd the total amounts, which are eventually agreed to be due to Koweit and Irac* K.W.aiaatter Esq. E InN' 164 by the Hejaai Government, can be respectively reduced by &amp;e amount of tiiese two sums. We think that if the matter is put to the Iraqi Government in this way they can have no legitimate oau.e for complaint, and we are very glad to know feat the Colonial office take the same line. We agree that it vvould be well to draw Humphrys attention to the use of 'guineas' instead of 'pounds' in fee Iraqi letters to him and to Fuad Bey Hamna, Ouf official letter in reply to your letter Ho, • 79101/30 of the 31st Deoember, about Nuri Pasha's proposed visit to Jedda will by now have reached you. I suppose that you will now telegraph to Bagdad on both points. We should be grateful for an opportunity of seeing the draft, or drafts. We can then consider the despatch of Instructions to Ryan to pay the three thousand pounds to the Political Agent at Koweit, and the seven thousand pounds to Humphrys for transmission to the respective governments# I am sending copies of this letter to Laithi/vaite and Pe^?irse # (Sd) G.]?.A.Warner.* ■ .77 v p.r&gt;TTPIDEIJTlAlf U BueHiRr '' No# q in List ^.4 165 fas. £(&gt;/ QOHfjill/irUl feOO^Oo' ] h O.P.6-N/51.

In consequence His Majesty's Government do not propose to raise with the Hejaz Government the question of that portion of the counter claim which deals with alleged damage by R.A.P. operations. Nevertheless in order to preclude possibility of any misunder standing I should be glad if you would inform the Prime Minister that His Jlaje sty's GoTermnent oould not in any event accept liability in respect of the first five Items on the Statement of Claims enclosed with Jfuad hamza's letter to the Prime Hinister of 25th of July. A3 regards U) 1 note witia re S ret that the Iraq Government have adopted an unhelpful attitude in this connection,and that they have ' committed thenselves to that attitude in a letter to168 to tlie Mejaz Government without first consulting you. His Majesty's Government are fully satisfied that the £10,000 in question is the advance payment which at the preliniinary negotiations with Go lone 1 JBiscoe in January 19 30 Ihn Saud promised to make in respect of 'both Iraq and Kuwaiti Claims and the question to be decided is therefore not whether this sum should be divided between Iraq and Kuwait but what proportion of it should be paid to each. In spite of several requests the Iraq Government have maintained an unhelpful attitude in the matter and in the circumstances His Majesty?3 Government see no alternative but to proceed with the distribution of the sum in question as originally proposed namely &lt;£7,000 to Iraq and £3,000 to Kuwait. HiB Majesty 8 s representative at Jeddah will accordingly be requested to make the necessary arrangements to this end and to infoim the Hejaz Government what amounts have been paid to each so that corresponding deductions can be made from the total suras eventually agreed upon as iDeing due to Iraq, and Kuwait. I shall be glad if you will inform the Iraq Government of this decision. I note that in the above mentioned letters from the Iraq Government the word 'guineas' is frequently used for 'pounds'. I suggest that the Iraq Government's attention might be drawn to this error.I „ ^ M l V / 7 ^ ^ it ^ THIS D O CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC M A JESTY'S G OVERNMENT. Jgg EASTERN (Arabia).

The memorandum has been drawn up in the light of your conversation 0 ° ^e subject mth members of my Department, and as a result of consultation with the other Departments of His Majesty's Government concerned. It is being; issued as an instruction to the High Commissioners for Iraq, Palestine and Translordan the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and other British officials m the Near and Middle East concerned. | ns ^ ruc ^i ons therein should be regarded as superseding those contained m the memorandum enclosed in the Foreign Office despatch referred to above. I have, &amp;c. ARTHUR HENDERSON. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum respecting Communications with Ihn Saud and the Hejaz-Nejd Government. THE creation of a British Legation at Jedda and the establishment of more normal diplomatic relations with King Ibn Saud have necessitated a revision of the arrangements embodied in the Foreign Office memorandum of the 16th September, 1929 (enclosed in the despatch No. 198 of the same date to His Majesty's agent and consul at Jedda), which is superseded in its entirety by the present memorandum. 2. It is desired in future to conduct relations with King Ibn Saud and his Government as far as possible in accordance with the usual diplomatic procedure. Matters which appear to the British authorities in Iraq, Palestine, Transjordan, the Persian Gulf and elsewhere to require representations to King Ibn Saud or his Government will, therefore, normally be referred by the High Commissioners, the Political Resident, &amp;c., to the respective Government Departments in London, if they involve questions of policy, or direct to His Majesty's Legation at Jedda, if of lesser importance. Copies of despatches sent to London should, save in exceptional circumstances, be sent direct to Jedda, and telegrams repeated to that post. Similarly, in the case of despatches and telegrams addressed direct to Jedda, copies and repetitions should be sent to London. 3. When reports are addressed to His Majesty's Government, the Foreign Office will issue any necessary instructions to His Majesty's Minister at Jedda. When they are addressed to Jedda, His Majesty's Minister will use his discretion as to the form of any representations which he considers he can properly make to the Hejazi authorities without seeking or awaiting instructions from His Majesty's Government. 4. The British authorities in Iraq, Palestine, Transjordan, the Persian Gulf, &amp;c., may use their discretion as to drafting any proposed representations m the form of a memorandum suitable for transmission verbatim to the Hejaz-Nejd authorities. This procedure may conveniently be followed when the subject matter consists mainly of a recital of facts. In all cases, however His Maiesty s Minister will have discretion to use the memorandum as he thinks nt. He will also have discretion, if he elects to forward the memorandum, to introduce minor alterations of language not affecting the sense of the document. [328 t—1]from f ^ views^f^Iis 1 Majesty^ Goverimen^or British be conveved to him by the quickest available means In sucli cases tne ±3ritisn authorities cOTicerned should report to His Majesty's Government by telegram Mi °at^ Ae reasons for and the nature of the proposed representations and repeating their telegram to His Majesty's Minister a 'I^ud'until they however actually despatch such communications to King Ibn baud until they receive th^ appmval of His Majesty's Government, save m some exceptional emergency when circumstances render it essential, in their opinion, t afc t W XoufdSwithout awaiting sanction Should this be done their acUonandlhe reasons for it should simultaneously be ported by telegram to His Majesty s Government, and the telegram repeated to His Majesty s Minister at Jedda. 6. In certain cases,when King Ibn Saud has been m personal relations with British authorities in Iraq, Transjordan or the Persian Gulf he may possibly address letters direct to such authorities In sudh cases the officer addressed should, unless the subject of the letter is of minor importance obtain, before replying, the instructions of the senior British representative m the territory concerned, or, in the case of the territories bordering on the Persian Gulf of the Political Resident, and in all cases, even if he replies without doing this, copies of the correspondence should be sent through the usual channels to His Majesty's Government and to His Maiesty s Minister at Jedda. It is not desired to encourage communications of this kind; bat they may on certain occasions serve a useful purpose, especially if they arise out of personal friendly relations with King Ibn Saud, provided (a) that the matters dealt with are m the main, of local interest, and (b) that the necessary steps are taken to keep His Majesty's Government and His Majesty's Minister at Jedda fully informed. ' 7. His Majesty's Minister at Jedda will continue to keep the British authorities in Iraq, Palestine, Transjordan, the Persian Gulf, &amp;c., fully informed by despatch or telegram, as the case may be, of all matters anectmg those authorities, regarding whiclh he is in communication with the Foreign Office or the Hejaz-Nejd authorities. Fe will normally leave it to the authorities concerned, more especially the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to supply the Government of India with information, where this may be necessary; but, in cases immediately affecting that Goyernment or having an important bearing on their interests or policy, or requiring decision by them, or having important Moslem reactions, he will communicate direct with the Political and Foreign Secretary to the Government of India.

Nuri Pa ™a has not yet issned a report on his tour, as the secretary to the mission has not yet returned to Bagdad. Nuri Pasha has, however, told me the gist of tus discussions at Mecca, and, m any case, the results of his mission are sufhciently illustrated by the instruments that he negotiated and signed. 3. Before he left Bagdad Nuri Pasha discussed with me in detail the questions that he proposed to raise with the Hejaz-Nejd Government. These- wer (i) The ' Bon-Voisinage ' Treaty and Arbitration Protocol. (ii) Extradition. (iii) Ibn Mashhur. (iv) The payment by the Hejaz-Nejd Government of the balance of £23,000 outstanding on account of Iraq tribal claims. Nuri Pasha told me that he had no intention of discussing the project of a pan-Arab alliance, except in so far as measures for the removal of customs and passport barriers, which he intended to propose, could be said to further this project. He also informed me of his intention to send Taha-al-Hashimi, the chief of the General Staff, on a mission to the Imam of Yemen, and undertook, on my suggestion, to acquaint King Ibn Saud with his intention first, and to ensure that His Majesty had no objection. Finally, in view of Sir John Shuckburgh's demi-official letter, dated the 12th November, 1930, I asked Nuri Pasha to ascertain whether King Ibn Saud still harboured any resentment in regard to the appointment of Dr. Abdullah Damluji as Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs. 4. As regards the instruments signed by Nuri Pasha at Mecca, your Lordship will observe that the texts of the ' Bon-Voisinage ' Treaty and Arbitration Protocol correspond closely to the texts initialled in Bagdad a year ago. 'Such amendments as have been made conform generally to advice tendered by this High Commission. The exceptions are the incorporation in the preamble •of a somewhat obscure paragraph referring to ' the desire of their Majesties to exert every possible effort to compose the affairs of the Arab nation and unite her word,' and the insertion in article 13 of the words £ 'or nationals of the two ■contracting parties.' The former amendment, which seems innocuous, may be attributable to a desire on the part of Nuri Pasha to justify the declaration made beforchis departure of his intention to promote the cause of Arab unity. The second amendment, which extends to Iraq and Nejd nationals the restrictions which in the original draft were applicable only to foreigners, appears, at first sight, to conflict with article 6, which provides for complete freedom of movement of tribes for grazing purposes. I am advised, however, that the specific obliga tion involved in article 6 would be considered as overriding the general prohibition contained in article 13. 5. The Extradition Treaty provides in article 3 that the surrender of political offenders shall not be permissible. At the same time, as your Lordship will observe from the notes exchanged between Nuri Pasha and the Minister for [138 ee—1] 1 ) Not printed.Foreign Affairs of the Hejaz-Nejd Governmeut ^ assurance that oftences normally committed by i -u j as nolitical.

I lost no- time on the return of Nuri Pasha to Bagdad in conveying to him the message ot congratulation from His Majesty's Government contained in your Lordship s telegram No. 148, dated the 19th April, 1931, a message which, as 1 have already reported to your Lordship, he greatly appreciated, 10.

Article 2. Relations of diplomatic and consular representation shall forthwith be established between the two kingdoms, in accordance with the procedure obtaining under public international law. Article 3.

Article 4. As soon as information reaches the competent authorities prescribed in article 8 of preparation being conducted in their territories by one or more armed individuals with the intention of committing highway robbery, or raiding, or other unlawful acts in the zone in the neighbourhood of the frontier of the two kingdoms, these authorities shall mutually inform one another, or the officials or tribes of the other, of the same without delay. Article 5. In the event of either of the two high contracting parties receiving informa tion of any of the acts mentioned in article 4 above having been committed withm his territories, he^shall have the right to notify the other party with a view to adopting the necessary measures for the punishment of the aggressors after their return to his country if they be of his subjects and to prevent them crossing the frontier if they be subjects of the informant or other Government. Article 6.

AS our efforts for the conclusion of an Extradition Treaty have been crowned with success, and in view of the desire expressed by His Majesty the King in the course of conversation between us on the morning of the 20th Dhul Qi'dat, 1349, that I should submit a special formal letter on the subject of offences committed by bedouins, I have the honour to submit to your Highness that offences normally committed by bedouins are bound to come within the acts of assault with violence, robbery, plunder, highway robbery, theft of the various kinds, wounding or murder, committed by one or more individuals against an individual or a group. I assure your Highness that all these offences and also that of raiding, which are provided for in the Bahra Agreement and in the Iraqi Law No. 47 of 1927 for the prevention of raids and plunder, are considered ordinary offences in respect of which extradition will be carried out, and which it is impossible to 'construe' as political offences. I trust that this, my letter, will fully satisfy the desire of His Majesty the King. Please accept, &amp;c.18 In the name of God, the Merciful the Compassionate. From Abdul Aziz bin Abdul Rahman al Faisal al Sa'ud. To His Excellency Sir Francis Humphrys. We received with pleasure Your Excellency's kind letter dated the 27th of March, 1931, and we thank you for your cordial greetings, fe are glad to be able to inform you that Nuri Pasha al Sa'id arrived here to see us with his staff and that the negotiations ended with the signing of the Bon Voisinage Treaty and the Extradition Treaty. mile we thank Your Excellency for the efforts which you have made to achieve this end, we express our confidence that it is the mutual good will between the two countries which will be the strongest safeguard for the true execution of these two treaties. As regards the question of Ibn Mashhur I have informed my brother that it is no longer important except as a matter of principle, this being that it should be realised that every bedouin who acts sub- versively will be overtaken by retribution wherever he may go. No doubt (he will give effect to) his promise that whenever Ibn Mashhur is found in 'Iraq terriuory he will be arrested and surrendered and also that his family and property which he left in 'Iraq will be surrendered now and in this manner the matter will be closed. We- 2 - vk We are pleased that the Arab mare so delimited you and we thank you for your interest in the matter of the wireless sets. In conclusion we express to Your Excellency our great appreciation of all that you have done to bring about these gratifying results between the two countries and we are confident that your endeavours will be continued in the same manner and will be of great help in solving any difficulty which may arise: God grant that no such difficulty may occur.

Huri P»Bha Al Sa'id. Peaoo bo upon you and tho mor qy of God, Our Privato Secretary and Undor-Sooretary of State for Foreign Affsira, Yueuf Yaein, has submitted to ue the verbal convereationSwhich heve taken place between you and him on the v^rioue matters between us and 'Iraq, in particular the conrereation on the question of the extradition of offenders, In view of our desire to make all possible concessions with the object of reaching a satisfactory settlement of the various matter#®* which we are at variance, we had wished to discuss these various subjects verbally with you # but we found that correspondence is more suitable for a clear and plain statement of our views* Hence this our letter to Your Kxeellency, We felt optimistic upon the receipt by ue of the telegram of our brother His ksjesty King Faisal , which was followed up by a comraunication from the •Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the question of the extr®dition of offenders, we felt more optimistic still of reaching a settlement of all problems ur&gt;on hearing of Your xcellency^ desire for 'a union of the word of the Ar8bs ,, (i.e. brin ing about unity of opinion among the Arabs) and for the strengthening of neighbourly relations betweem them. From that we felt certain that the question of the extradition of offenders would be settled in accordance with our point of view as previously explained by us. But upon perusal of the latest draft put forward by you we found that the attitude of the 'Irsqi Government had not changed. As this 'matter is difficult for us', since it was responsible for ^ previous dispute between us and 'Iraq, and we are afraid lest it should occasion future disputes, we are unable to make compromises over it.p 190 - 2 - Ther# hnd \&gt;t«noutBtp.nding between u» and 'Iraq four mast Important quaatlona, two of which we have Bottled. Bio firet waa the qaeetion of the eettlement of raiding claims aa 'between our suhjeeta and those of the 'Iraqi O ots rnraent # which we left to our brother Hie tt^Jeety King ^aieal to settle at his discretion and which he hae settled aceordingly and we hare aooeoted his award in it. the second question was that of the Treaty of Bon Yoisinage, which has now been settled. There rmaln two questions under discussion, -mo first is that of the extradition of offenders which we hope will be easily settled. It has, howorer, been a matter of deep regret for us that you should insist on approximately the earns attitude which the 'Iraq adopted in the paot. As your excellency is aware, what is most dear to us is our men (t People), who are our support, and whom we hays fought end taken into captirity in order to carry out the obliga- tions which our pledgee impose on us and which place us on closer relations (of friendohip) with our neighbour.. It is on this account that we are anxious to secure the remedy which is capable of curing the ailment - an ailm.nt which lt i. feard might endanger the good relation, between the two countries. W. are unable to place on our.elres obliga- tions beyond our capacity and which we will not ba able to honour, a. it would be difficult to prerent raiding into neighbouring territorie. unl.e. the Oo^rnment were confident that they would be able to reach with their arm the Offender, with . wiew to their punishment^and that such offenders would ha^ no shelter to .awe the. from punishment. Therefore, we have three altematiwe proposals to make to vou for cholo® (1) except from the term -political offences- the offences committed by -desert rnen-^om major and minor persons, and deem-. aW ounces co ^itted by them a. ordinary offence. tn respect of which extradition should be granted. (2) A. proposea by Yusuf to you. do not consider a. politics! of fences * ct * pJP ai8Sa1,lt ^ ^191 pUlag., plunder, th.ft of aU kinds, wounding or murder, committed by one or more indiyidume against indiTiduals or against their own King, or against the ioeal authorities. Also offencee of raiding no t to be considered political of fences, i.e. either government will surrender to the other gOTernm^nt eny individual or party of her (? lUter^or former) subjects who had oerrisd out acts of r-i-iing in thei, territory of origin or the territory of the other party, flimilerly attempt against the persons of Their Mejesties or member, of their fellies ere not to be considered political offences # la this way the gap will be filled, (8) In cese neither of the above two alternatives is accectable, we accept your own proposal, provided that you will addrees to us a foriaei letter infomtn^ us that offences coiaraitted by -desert men- will not be considered politioal offences^and in respect of all such offences extradition will be granted. By this matters will be all right, but failing that we cannot guarantee peace and tranquility on the frontier, we consider that this will be in the interest of both our and your subjects, and will also ensure peace between the two countries. As to the fourth question, it is that of the (frontier) poets constructed contrary to the 'Uqair Protocol, which we suggest you should consider yourself and put up to us your proposals for a solution to it. Perhaps the matter will be disposed of by a proposal from you, mafeing resort to arbitration unnecessary, we hope to receiTe your written reply on these questions, and trust that efforts for effecting the necessary rapproschment between the two countries will succeed.

I beg leave to set forth as follows my reply in regard to the two questions eald ty Your Majesty to hare remnlned outstanding between the two Kingdoms : 1 # Question of Bxtradition Agreement, $hen considering the draft Extradition Agreement my Oovernment had in view the point th^t the draft should be suited to the general conaitions prevailing in the two Kingdoms. Thus they found It inevitable to include in the draft a provision for the exception of political offenders jTj/f from extradition, for two essential reasons, besides secondary ones : firstly i The institutiona of mxMtm the Kingdom of •Iraq •re those of • Conotltutionsl at.teunfler which the people • t'Iraq exercise aomplete control oyer all state affairs through Parliament which consists of two legislative cham bers to whom are submitted all treaties and agreements, which thsy either ratify or reject. It is thus beyond the power of any 'Iraqi Oorernment to take action which they beliere to be inconeistent with ttie wishes of the majority in the aforesaid two chambers. I do not thinlc I would be wrong In believing that any' 193 . 3 - agreement which does not ensure the exception of political offenders from extradition can have amy hop** of being ratified by the 'Iraqi Parliament. Secondly ; The principle of excepting political offenders from extradition is one recognized by all civilized states. The refusal of any state to surrender *a any political offender claimed by his state does not normally have any adverse effect on the relation® of friendship existing between the two states concerned. X thAnk Your Majesty will agree with me that it would be harmful to the reputation of the two sister Kingdoms if they were to conclude an extradi tion agreement of a nature inconsistent with general princi ples recognized as between civilized states, t have entered into negotiations with Your Majesty 's Private Secretary and Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Shaikh Yusuf Y^sin, with the above two matters un «roid»blv,tn tofYour Hoje.ty'. .tronc desire, .tatafl to me by Sheikh Yueuf. for the smonament of the text of Article 3 of the dMft Agreement, and eleo w# the generel recommenaetion given to me by the (JoTornment of Hie MeJoety my King that I ehould -afford eXl the faoilitiee- (or m,ko .11 the oonoe.eions) of whioh circumeteneee end public intereet permit with a Tie* to settling the quoetions forming the object of my deputation. I h*™ expressed my willingneoe to agree to the amendment of the article in quoation by the addition thereto of a clause providing that any armed -rieing- (T attempt) ageinet the person of Your Majooty or the person of any member of Your Jiajesty's family rtiall not be regarded a political offence. This of euro, recuires. on the principle of reciprocity, that any armod rising against the person of Hi. M.&gt;«ty my King or the person of any member of his family should not be regarded a political offence. Ho sutf-h thing, boeerer. was iuggested by my government. I hare agreed to accept the -.bove amendment, onV r -a* ' 194 my own responalMlity^ln th® belief th ^t it win h -ye the full *rpprov*a of Your Majesty and that it will proye inetrumtntal In reconciling the view points of the two sroTernments. Tour Msjeety will no doubt realize that 'by acting as I h«Te done. I am talcing % step towards •rapproechment' {9 agreement), and that the amendment which I have expressed myself/ willing to accept differs considerably from the original proposal put forward by my government, I, therefore, cannot help expressing my astonishment at the statement raede in Your Majesty's letter that the attitude of my government hss not changed, I have carefully examined the thre^ (alternative.) proTiosalf contained in Your Majesty's letter, and I find that there is no difference between the first aad the third in principle^althougli they do differ in form. It appears t\mt the principal purpose of th^se proposals is to prevent raiding. In this connection, I am gled to (be able to) assure Your Majesty that my government is not less anxious than Your Majesty*s Government^for the prevention of reiding. In the eyes of my aovemment raiding is an 7 ordinary offence punishable under the 'Law for the Prevent tion of Halifng ^nd blunder No,47 of 1927«♦, of which I beg leeve to enclose herewith » copy for the inforimtion of Your Majesty, It Is a well knows undisputable principle that an offender, whatever his nationality, is puni ^hible for his offence in the county In which it was comialtted when apprehended that country. Proposal 2 of Your Majesty's proposals is taken from a certein article in the dreft treaty intended for conclusion between ^raq and ¥gypt. It is not hid that this (? latter) draft is based on prin* ciples which require that it should be left to the judicial authorities a« a mitter of right to decide whether an offender is to be extradited or not ^aooording as the saidff • 4 ' 195 authorities my be satisfied after examin/ the offence, tiie evidence of witnesses and other matters which are difficult to InTestigato in Your i.iajesty's Kingdom having regwrd to ite existing institutions. The article in question is a component part of a whOle comprealising several articles which cnnno^ he taken in part, hut only as a whole. Personally, I believe that the acceptance of such principles will not ensure the expedition sought in the settlement of cases arising between UrvCf our two Kingdoms, nor As*?* it ensure our aim not to allow increased cause for complaint and murmuring. nevertheless, should Your Majesty ultimately prefer to depend on such principles, I would in thfit case be bound to consult my Government in the matter on my return to Baghdad. This, ss is obvious, will require the very bases of Ihe queatti tlon to be reconsidered. I, however, hope that my foregoing representations may afford means for the satisfaction of Your Majesty* s wishes in this behalf. 2. qtiaation of frontier PoetSc, This question, as is not hi&lt;1^4 *a8 settled between Your Majesty and His Majesty your brother King Faisal, and I hsve no instructions eoncerning it. If Your Majesty has any propo- sal on the subject, I am perfectly ready to convey it to the Government of His Majesty your brother ? for conaideration. Please deign to accept, etc. etc.196 THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT i ^ [ BUShg ^Sap-Nrv EASTERN ( Arabia ). . /V ' April 29, 1931. // / CONFIDENTIAL. _____ / ' S ection 3. [E 2230/2/25] No. 1. Sir A. Ryan to Mr. A. Henderson.—{Received April 29.) (No. 140.) gir, Jedda, April 13, 1931. WITH reference to my telegram No. 81 of the 9th instant, I have the honour to submit a fuller account of the proceedings during the visit of the Prime Minister for Iraq to this country. Although it may be some little time before I can send this despatch, I think it will conduce to clarity if I embody in it all that I know of what passed while Nuri Pasha was actually here and reserve for a further report anything that I may hear from the other side in due course. 2. Nuri Pasha arrived in Jedda by Khedivial steamer from Suez on the morning of Easter Sunday, the 5th April, accompanied by three other delegates, namely, Taha Pasha El Hashimi, Muwaffaq Bey El Alousi and Ahmed Bey Manafisi. Considering it appropriate in the circumstances to show special courtesy, although the mission were the guests of the Hejazi Government, I sent Mr. Wikeley to present compliments to Nuri Pasha on board and myself met him on the quay. 3. From what the Pasha told Mr. Wikeley, it appeared that he expected to find Ibn Saud in Jedda. As a matter of fact, not only the King but our nominal Minister for Foreign Affairs sat tight in Mecca. Minor officials greeted Nuri Pasha on board, and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, with the Governor of Jedda and others, received him on the quay. A respectable guard was turned out and there were plenty of cars, but the reception otherwise was, perhaps, hardly adequate to the principal visitor's rank, according to oriental ideas. 4 I had understood that Nuri-Pasha would be accommodated at the villa outside Jedda usually assigned to official European visitors of high rank, and had supposed that the main negotiations would take place in Jedda. It was, m tact, the intention that the mission should be put up at Kandara, at any rate tor the first night, and that Yusuf Yasin should give a dinner, to which I was to be bidden This plan was upset, apparently by Nun Pasha himself, and the mission went on to Mecca in the afternoon. I at first supposed that this might be due to an objection on the Pasha's part to being put off with Sheikh Yusuf Yasm but I cannot affirm this now. The Pasha had expected to arrive on the 4th April an to leave on the 11th. The Khedivial time table did not allow of his getting here before the 5th and necessitated his leaving on the 8th or 9th. Expedition was therefore essential, and it was certainly a more practical plan, as ibn baud eiecteci to remain in Mecca, to mobilise everybody concerned there as soon as possible. 5. The same need for haste probably accounted for the fact that the Pasha did not call on me after his arrival, although he sent a card. Nothmg m our subsequent intercourse could justify me in supposing that he wished to ignore me or come the Premier over a British representative of inferior rank. When I met him he hailed me as an old friend, for he had come to see me in 1913 or 1914 when he was a young officer in Constantinople for some political purpose 1 gathered afterwards that it had to do with the events wnich led to iC arres . the Turkish Government of the well-known El Masn and the intervention of the British Embassy to prevent his being put to deatn. , , .. 6. So the mission and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin hurried off to Mecca on the afternoon of the 5th April. I heard nothing further until the 7th when the telephone wires buzzed with enquiries about steamers to take Taha Pasha and Muwaffaq Bey to Hodeidah and Nuri Pasha himself to Suez. I received the same day a reply to a suggestion I had broached just afte r the mission arrived that they should dine at the Legation any night that would fit m with the official programme. I had not pursued this further after the mission s departure for Mecca, but I received a spontaneous intimation on tire 7th that they and Yusuf Yasin would dine with us next evening, but that the Emir Feisal could not leave Mecca. There was still no news of the progress of the negotiations. [88 ff—3]2 7. Ou the afternoon of the 9th Sheikh Yusuf Yasin telephoned to ask whether we should mind if he and Nuri Pasha were late for dinner. He added, on Nuri Pasha's behalf and his own, that things were going well and that everything was nearly settled. I replied that, if they brought news of a complete agreement on all important matters, it would be a happy evening for me as well as for them. This little bit of encouragement was my only intervention in the actual negotiations. Later, I heard that all the important questions had been settled, not without difficulty, and when the Pasha and the Sheikh arrived late at the Legation they were extremely pleased both with themselves and with each other. The utmost good feeling prevailed at our party, which was attended by Nuri Pasha, Ahmed Bey, Sheikh Yusuf, with other local notables, selected members of the British community and the representatives of countries bordering on Iraq. 8. I have related these individually trivial incidents in detail, as they show the setting of the first meeting of capital importance in which Iraq and Hejaz- Nejd have met, conscious of the presence of His Majesty's Government in the background, but not looking to them for guidance. The event has proved me wrong in my forecast that they would be unable to agree without British mediation. It almost looks as though both sides wished to show how well Arabs could get on if left to themselves; but it is only fair to add that, when I warmly congratulated Nuri Pasha and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the outcome, they acknowledged handsomely how much they owed to Great Britain and her representatives. 9. As regards the actual negotiations, I can add little material to what I have telegraphed. Sheikh Yusuf said that he hoped to see me in two or three days after a necessary return to Mecca. Meanwhile I have only the information which Nuri Pasha gave me on the evening of the 8th April. He expressed spontaneously a wish to tell me something about what had passed. We talked privately for over an hour after dinner, but I confined myself to asking only such questions as arose out of his explanations and put only one important question of my own, namely, whether he had disposed of the Ibn Mashhur affair. He replied to this question affirmatively but without going into detail. 10. Nuri Pasha did not dwell on the question of the desert posts, but it appeared from his rather vague statement that it had once more been agreed to have recourse to arbitration after a further attempt to settle the matter amicably. He had had difficulty in getting the ' Bon-Voisinage' Agreement actually signed. The Hejazis raised all sorts of points of detail, and it was evident from what the Pasha told me that they were still reluctant to commit themselves finally to ' Bon-Voisinage ' without being sure of an extradition treaty. On the 6th and 7th April he found Yusuf Yasin sticky, and the 8th April was a difficult day. Nuri Pasha went off to the King at least twice, and eventually the f ' Bon-Voisinage ' Agreement was signed, while the question of extradition was still under discussion. I did not gather what form had been finally given to the clause on political offenders in the text of the Extradition Agreement. Nuri Pasha spoke more of the play which he had made with the Iraqi law on raiding and of the letter in agreed terms which it was finally settled that he should write on that subject. He gave me no details of the subsidiary questions which the King had wished to discuss, such as wells near the frontier, the collection of taxes in the neutral zone and Wakfs, but said that the King had accepted his view that these matters could be settled best in later correspondence. He left Mecca without having actually signed the Extradition Agreement, but the text signed by the Mmister for Foreign Affairs on the 8th April was brought to Jedda at midnight and Nuri Pasha signed it here on the morning of the 9th April. It is interesting of texts Pnnce-Mmister apparently played no role except as a signatory fhr J} h f , Nu T ri p asha seemed to he confident of putting both the agreements through the Iraq Parliament before the end of the present session A1 AtraJ W j\ StT Tu by the eagerness to get the question of Sultan A1 Atrash and his followers settled on the basis of their being received in Iraq. sub^eoTwit^wh^ &gt;. catl01 ! ^ or trou bling you with a separate telegram on a folirwed tS^spLdree^ithlarr' 81011 t0 ^ P reviousl y' alth ™g h 1197 13 Nun Pasha said that he had been anxious to explain to the King his reasons for ^ndmg Taha Pasha El Hashimi and Muwaffaq Bey to Sana and to assure himself that it would not indispose Ihn Saud if they went on straight from here. To me he explained that Taha Pasha had been employed as Chief of Staff 1 did not gather when or by what Government, in the Yemen and knew the Imanl well. He was therefore peculairly qualified to explore a situation of which very little was known. He belmved that His Majesty's Government themselves had only scanty information. Taha Pasha and his colleagues were unable to catch a south-bound steamer leaving here on the 8th April and stayed behind in Mecca when Nun Pasna came here. 14. The Pasha mentioned one matter not recorded in my telegrams, namely, that he had reconciled Ibn Saud to Dr. Abdullah Damluji, and had received a friendly message from His Majesty to deliver to that gentleman 15 Nun Pasha left Jedda on the 9th August by the Khedivial steamer which had brought him and which delayed its return to Suez twenty-four hours to give him more time. He was seen off by much the same local notables as had received him, except that I think Sheikh Yusuf Yasin went on board The Turkish and Persian representatives, Mr. Wikeley and I also went to the quay. 16. Altogether the mission has been a greater success than I had dared to anticipate. Both sides have shown qualities of statesmanship. They will doubtless quarrel a great deal in the future, but the present agreement with them marks a notable advance along the road which His Majesty's Government wish to see the Arab States follow in their relations with each other. If Nuri Pasha has a fault it is, perhaps, that he exaggerates his personal success with people like the King and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin He is, I fancy, too much of a European in externals and too little of a practising Moslem to appeal to them really. On the other hand, he seems to have been both businesslike and con ciliatory, and his general qualities could not fail both to impress and to attract others, however different their outlook. He seems to have a gift for remembering people. Changes of hair and headdress make recognition difficult in the Near East of to-day, but it was delightful to see the Prime Minister of Iraq twice chuck the Hejazi Director-General of Military Organisation under the chin when the former discovered an old colleague in the latter; and the Pasha and the Turkish Charge d'Affaires were with difficulty parted at 1 a.m . after they had located a common past. 17.

My dear Brother, „ IT is a cause of great pleasure for us to seize the opportunity oi the dispatch of our loyal and trusted Prime Minister, Nuri Pasha A1 Said, on a mission to the court of our brother to convey to him our most sincere greetings and good wishes, together with our deep thanks for the noble sentiments he has expressed in his last telegram. I beg my dear brother to know that whenever I recalled my meeting with his dear self and the good understanding and friendship which, thanks to God, were achieved at that meeting, I felt more and more confident that the bonds of friendship which developed at the said meeting would prove most happily effective in cementing the relations of amity and brotherhood between our two kingdoms. It is now most gratifying to me to find that that friendship has borne fruit in our common interest and that of the whole Arab nation, whom, we trust, God will help us to serve and enhance the position thereof. The object of the deputation of Nuri Pasha A1 Said, who admires the high character of our brother, and who longs for the honour of attending on his magnificent person, is, firstly, to sign the Agreement of ' Bon-Voisinage,' , strengthen all the various other relations and connexions normally of interest to friendly sister countries, and submit our views on the question of the extradition of criminals between our sister kingdom, which, but for the fact that it affects our relations with other States, would have been settled a long time ago. Our dear brother may feel assured that we shall spare no effort for the realisation of our common aspirations in this connexion. As regards other matters which affect the finding of strong bases calculated to help us both to repulse external (? foreign) ambitions and strengthen the position of our Arab nation and enhance its prestige among (other) nations, we have confided to Nuri Pasha A1 Said the contemplations of our mind on the subject, and I beg my dear brother to be so good as to lend his special and careful attention to his (Nuri Pasha's) representations. Finally, I wish my dear brother perfect health and prosperity, and his people every success and happiness. Done at Bagdad, this 23rd day of Eamadan, 1349, corresponding with the Tlth February, 1931.
