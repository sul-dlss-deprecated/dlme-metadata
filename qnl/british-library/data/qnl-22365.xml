Adviserate, March 24, 1948. Regarding the matters which Stevenson discussed during his visit here, His Highness is most interested in the idea of reopening a broadcasting station in Bahrain and would be prepared to finance the running of it provided that it was a State Broadcasting station He would gladly issue through it any information which could be supplied by the Public Relations Department® 2, As you know we hope soon to have a printing press and will then begin to issue a G-overnment G-azette in Arabic containing all public notices and information of a general kind with occasional news notes etc. This might perhaps develop later into a newspaper. 3. Stevenson also spoke of closing the reading room in Hilal building, using our school library as a general reading room and opening a small reading room in Muharraq. I think this might be done though the Director of Education does not look very favourably on the suggestion. The hostel library is used mostly by school boys and it is not very desirable that they should be given opportunities of mixing with some of the young men who frequent the present reading room. There are now two rooms on the ground floor, with a wide veranda, available in His Highness's newly restored building south-east of the P.C.L. Rest House, which could I think be let as a Reading Hoom if you still consider moving out of the Hilal building. These rooms would be very suitable and the rent would be in the neighbourhood of Ka.lOO/- per month. Several other people are asking for them but I have told His Highness* agent not to let them till I hear from you.j,0.668-s persian gulf residency B ahrain Dated the 27th March, 1948 Please refer to our discussion on the 24th March regarding Public Relations. 2. I enclose a copy of Morrison's note and request that you will be good enough to ask the Bahrain Government if they will permit us to supply the Education Department v Hostel Library with literat ure. If they agree, could you kindly acquire a suitable Readirig Room in Muharraq on rent ? V- -S C,J.

BAHIi&gt;--1N 1. That the Reading Room in Manama be closed down and that a new Reading Room be opened in Muharraq. 2. That (with the approval of the Bahrain Government) the material now supplied to the Reading Room in Manama be given to the Education Departmei t Hostel Library. CQM^KNTd (a) x am told that for the most part the persons who use the Reading Room in Manama are Indians and Jews. The attendance is said to be about 15 persons every evening. (b) To concentrate on the Hostel Library would mean contacting the students who, from our point of view, constitute an important section of the community. Other persons in addition to the students use the Library. (c) Muharraq is important, I understand, because a number of the intelligentsia' live there. (d) If the Hostel Library plan is approved a small amount of capital expenditure will be required for the construction of boards on which to expose photographs and posters supplied by the C.O.I. The type of swing board in Mr. Belgrave's office is recommended. Additional shelves for books will be required also some more chairs and another table on which to lay out magazines etc. (e) In view of the additional work involved the librarian now in charge might receive a small monthly payment for his services. (f) The furniture and fittings in the Manama Reading Room can be transferred to Muharraq. Anything surplus to requirements at Muharraq could be given (or loaned) to the Hostel Library. All require reconditioning. 3. Books (a) Books received from London should be set at the dis cretion of the I.O.(P.R.O.) to the Hostel Library. (b) London might be asked for a supply of books to build up a library at Muharraq and to place it on the distribution list for the future. ' Periodi c als and N ews paper s. (a) The distribution list requires revision. (b) For example whilst the Hostel Library and schools are not on the list a number of merchants in the town are. (c) Bahrain distributes to Kuwait, Muscat, Sharjah and Dubai. Periodicals come by long - sea and take 2 months to get here. Newspapers come by air mail and take about five days. (d) Kuwait is supplied by sea from Bahrain and in tiew of the former's proximit® to Basra it might be preferable to supply it from there. 5• Photographs and Posters (a) These do not appear to be received regularly. I can arrange for this to be put right. (b) Photographs will require to be 'vetted by the 1.0.(c) Supplies should presumably also be sent to Kuwait, .uscat , Sharjah and Dubai. ♦ (d) Photo sets can be circulited amongst the posts. (e) the captions should be written in Arabic (i.e.translated) 6. Expenditure (a) The present budget is £.1500 p.a.; £1200 is proposed for 1948-49 Rs.167 Rs.600 ' 20 25 10 12 62 150 (b) The monthly expenditure is approximately (i) I.O's allowance (ii) Salaries (iii) Carriage and postage (iv) Entertainment (v) Incidental (vi)Newsletter to London (vii)Water and electric light (viii)Rent say, £ 80 per month = £.960 per annum. Comments (a) If the proposal to close down the Reading Room in Manama is approved and a smaller one in MuharraQ, is opened the monthly expenditure should be approximately: Rs.1036 (i) I.0 f s allowance ceases (ii) Salaries (iii) Carriave and postage (iv) Entertainment (v) Incidental (vi) Newsletter (vii) Water and electric light (^iii.)C©R% Rent (ix) Contribution to Hostel Librarian (Vide A(c)) Rs.nil ' 600 20 25 10 12 45 75 39 Rs.826 say. £.64 per month = £.768 per annum which leaves an unexpended balance of £.432 from the £.1200 approved for 1948-49. (b) The Superintendent now draws Rs.100 plus Rs.90 allowance = Rs.190 per month plus i pay and allowances of a certain Ali Tajir = Rs.145 plus Rs.65 allowance = Rs.210- Total Rs.400 p.m. (c) Istrongly recommend that the salary be consolidated. If the F.O. seesK that' the Superintendent is drawing part of another man's salary they are sure to comment adversely. (d) The balance of £.432 should be made available for Kuwait. 7. Receipts .

In this he is willing to include feature articles which I can supply him in Arabic from Baghdad.Fs (b) I can also supply (by air) the weekly edition of our Baghdad daily press summary in Arabic derived from Reuters and the London hress Service.

' ndedD.O.No.C/346 POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 6th April, 1948 My dear Dredge, V &lt; X I meant to see you, but have not had time recently, about the matters referred to in the copy of Belgrave's letter, which I enclose, and which are also raised in your D.0.668-S, dated the 27th March, 1948, to me. (Incidentally there was no copy of Morrison's note with your letter.) 2. I agree with the Director of Education that it is better to keep the Hostel Library and the Reading Room separate (at least if the Reading Room is to be open to the general public); and I think that in that case it would be better at least to keep on one room of the present Reading Room in the Hilal Building. If it is decided to do so, I see no point what so ever in moving out of it. If funds allow, I think a Reading Room at Muharraq would be a good thing. 3. Perhaps you would like to discuss these questions with Belgrave and I have no objection to your doing so, but should be glad if you would let me know what is decided. Yours sincerely, Major A.L.A. Dredge, MBE, Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain. \</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00019e_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/935</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00019e</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/935</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 4/14 Bahrain State Broadcasting Station'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1948/1948</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2013-12-20T00:01:28</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (8 folios)</extent><extent>File papers are arranged chronologically.
