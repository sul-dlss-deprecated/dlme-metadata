I have deducted 4 hours 45 minutes up till now but the results have not been very accurate. Another thing that seams very curious is that the highest tides instead cf showing a fluctuation of about 40 minutes a day sons- ti sa show a fluctuation of oror 2 hours, icr instance, the 1st L-arch is shorn as having a 5ft 9 in tide at 10.44 whereas Wednesday is shown as having a Gft tide at 12.58. I presume the deductions jouid give me the correct local time since the Bar ti es are given in standard time and local ti ;e is roughly standard time in Bahrain.
