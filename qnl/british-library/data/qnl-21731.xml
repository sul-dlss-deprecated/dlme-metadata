Saudi-Yemen Treaty.HeceivA^ under Jedda Printed Letter Ho 1923/17/56''’ dated the 27th June 1934. British Legation, Jedda 27th June, 19M Sir, With reference to my telegram Ho 151 of the 24th June I hare the honour to enclose herewith an annotated summary of the recen + treaty between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. It will be some little time before I can send you a full translation as it is a lengthy and rather difficult document and ray chief interpreter is a! sent on local sick leave. I have prepared the summary from a rough transla tion made by Mr Yurlonge with the assistance of the se- cond inerpreter. I an enxious that it should reach you /t as sokn as possible in view of the exaggerated statements which have appeared in the press, suggesting that the two countries have concluded an agreement tantamount to an alliance. I understand that Mr Philby has gone ever fur ther and reported to the Daily Mail that Ibn Sa’ud has es tablished a veiled protectorate over the Yemen. 2. Despite many obvious defects, the Treaty may be regarded as a fairly workmanlike document. It is in Eu ropean form and the pious formulae, which have done so much to obscure Saudi-Yemen relations in the past, have been reduced to a minimum. It would be hard to say whether Article 4, which determiner, the frontier, is sufficiently preeise to obviate future quarreli but it at lea ~?t allo cates the principle disputed areas. It is perhaps rather a pity that even now certain points should be referred back to the status quo before April 1933 and to Ibn Sa’ud’s Arbitral award of December 1931. On thwwhole , however. The Right Honourable, Sir John Simon, G. r .S.I. 'v.C. r O Ho 202 (1920/17/567) how ever“* /O “ ho^eTer, it would probably he .to be*?n impossible todo much better in dealing with regions of which there are no accurate maps and where tribol considerations are more important than geography. 3. Thre is nothing on the face of the Treaty to suggest that it has Ven concluded on other than equal terms. It is significant - n this connection that the Imam figures in it as M His Majesty *he King of the Yemen M a title never given to him in Saudi official language before + his Treat- was drawn up. Apart from the p eliminary conditions on which Ibn Sa’ud in sisted to ^he ast, there is no single provision which is mot based on the strictest reciprocity. ?hre is nof provision foran indemnity and, pace Mr Philby, nc/ppmsent evidence that Ibn Sa’ud has got one by some special arrangement outside the published texts. What it comes to is tteit he has, at any ra*e for tventyjyearB , established his title to both parts of 'Aeir and Hejran. and ^oi^hese undoubtedly solid gains he has pe id a longish price in military expenditure ani^a certain price in men. 4. Whether the T-eaty can be regarded as in any sens, an alliance is a nore difficult question. I myself ar. in- A /A &amp;*** m a. nfs /o o~r /\0/fcrng dined to think/ofthe kind . T he peculiar position of the parties as the only two really independent rulers in Arabia, both ardent xenophobes, has driven them into impressive affirm ations of their Moslem and Arab solidarity. In this matter, if no other, the mission of Arab mediators may have made themsellees felt. My new 'Iraqi colleague goes so far as to attribute the recurrent phrase ab ut brotherhood to the ins piration of the Amir Sjekib 'Arslan, with whom it is « favour ite catchword. Great play i s made with the doctrine ttet the people of the two ' u ountries' which are carefully distinguished r ' tlon ' the ,tord which, for the want of a better equivalent has been translated 'nation'' is not used so as to imply anv politiod unity. It refers rather to that ideal ... idee 13- ideal unity of Moslems and Arabs which it is the present fash' ion to acclaim. 5. When all is said and ddne there is little to suggest a real pooling of interests except Articles 15 and 17. former of these is no-*- very explicit. The latter contains a singular definition of neutrality, comppimded,1 think, of the three ideas that neutrality in the European sense is a duty, that a brother’s a brother for a’ that and that it just as well none the le^s to try a brother up in the knots ofk formal understanding if you diould need to trust to his neutrality. I am not ignoting the reference in Article 19 to the possibi lity of an ultimate customs union ' ut that need not, I think, be taken very seripusly at present. 6. The only other point to which I need advert is the reference to secrecy in the first pa-g^ of annexed letters. The Satdi letter suggests that the Treaty should be kept secret, expecially the part relative to the frontiers, for fear of disturbances, more particularly in the coastal region. It might have been supposed that this reason would operate until the Saudi evacuation, had been complete, but Ibn Sa’ud and his Government seem to have been conten/t in the end to delay publication only until their preliminary conditions had bee/n, fulfilled and the coming into force of the Treaty was assu red. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to His Majesty’s Ambassador, Home, His Majesty’s Chief Commissio ner, Aden, The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persisn Gulf, Busfriire, His Excellency the r igh Commissioner for Pa lestine, Jerusalem, His Majesty’s Ambassador, Baghdad, and His His Majes'y’s High Commissioner, Ramleh.

Amir Khalid ibn *Abdul ’Aziz for Ibn Sa’ud and ’Abdullah ibn Ahmed al Wazir for the Imam to conclude a Treaty as described in the heading in order to realise the objects stated. Note. Anong the objects are the termination of thf state of war; ’•uniting the word of the Moslem Arab mtion, raising its position, and maintaining itsurestige and inde pendence”; and the creation of a **united front against event- structure ua^ities and a solid mWa&amp;i&amp;fe to preserve the security of the Arab Peninsula**. 1.

Prayer for Hi a Blessing. 2. Mutual recognition by each Party of the complete Inde pendence and sovereignty of the other and his lawful suoessors. Abandonment of past claims by either to territory on the other side of the frontier now established. Note. Express mention Is made in the renunciation clause of possible claims by Ibn Sa'ud to territory formerly possessed by the Idrisis or others in what is now recognise* as Yemeni and claims by the Imam on grounds of Yemen unity of otherwise in respect of territory formerly possessed by the Idriisi or the Beni ’Aidh or of Najrun and the Yam country. 3. Neither party to concede to the other less than he concedes to any third party. Ne it*r bound to concede more • • •.. more j / r 'more than he gets in return* Note. Apparently intended as a most-favoured-nation clause 4# Description of agreed frontier Note. This long and felabotat* clause is very difficult to follow owing to the lack of accurate maps and the wealth of unfamiliar geographical and tribal names. It proceeds on th? TTv£? K and naming places and tribes which fall on one or the other side, ^he line runs east from the coast to the mountains of Tihamat ’Asir; then bends north to the north-westerly limit of the Beni Juma’, then east to the boundaries of Nuqa'a and Wa’ar belonging to the Walla tribe and the boundaries of the Yam; then to Madhiq Marwan and the Hi fade, pass; then east' to the boundary between tribes of the stock of Haradan ibn Zeyd, Waila etc. and the Yam. The Sketch enclosed in Chancery letter No 1743/209/19 of the 12th June to the Sastem Depart ment seems to correspond fairly well with this definition, if the line be continued more or less east between Najran and the Beni Jail, though it ir doubtless very inaccurate in detail. 5. N 0 fortifications to be erected within five kilometres of the frontier. 6. Occupying forces of each party to be withdrawn (forthwitij from the territory of the other and protection to be afforded tc 7. Each party to restrain his people from hostile action against those of the other and to prevent raiding. Captured property to be restored in accordance with legal investigations ranteed in caes of murder etc. and hostile acts to be punished upon proof of them. This provision to operate pending a fur ther agreement on the mode of assessing and investigating the inhabitants and troops. 7. Each oartv tn c la i ms. Parties not t 8 . o resort force for settlement of ofof disputes arising bet ween then under this Treaty or other wise, Failing settlement by friendly negdtiations , such dis putes shall be referred to arbitration to be conducted in accordance with the annexed agreement, which will &lt;be deemed an integral part of the Treaty, 9. Fach party to prevent action or preparations in his territory directed against the other party and to take action defined in this article against their authors on receipt of a written demand. Note, The action to be taken is defined under three heads according to whether the persons involved are subjects of the party applied to, of the applicant party or of a third party. The provisions are not unlike those laid down in the corr^soonding article of the Saudi-Transjordan Treaty of July 1933. 10. Fugitives from the jurisdiction of either party not to be admitted by the other. Entrance to be prevented and persons circumventing ipeasures to prevent it to be disarmed, arrested and surrendered; or if they cannot be arrested to be driven back to the country to which they belong, 11. Governors and officials of either party to be prevented from interfering with the subjects of the other. Measures to be taken to obviate disturbance or misunderstand ing as a result of such action. IS. People of areas assigned toeach party under this Treaty to be the subjects of that party. Neither party to accept as his subjects the subjects of the other party wi thout the latter’s consent. Subjects of either party in the territory of the other to be dealt with in accordance with the local law. 13. Amnesty to be granted by each party to the subjects of the other residing in his territory; to his own subjects who have taken refuse with or joined the other party, both crimes and as regards as regards/property taken from the time of their refuge ■ dping-4- dplng so to the time of their return. In case of doubt on the part of either party as to the fulfilment of this clause, he may call upon ^he other party to convoke a meeting of the representatives who have signed this Treaty, failing either of whom he may be replaced by a person having stated quali fications. TH^er decision to be binding. Note. The first sentence of this is very loese. The main object of the whole article a-nears to be to give the maximum of orotection to tribesmen and others who have sided with the other party in territory now reverting to one or othe r party. 14. Property of persons benefitting by the amnesty to be restored to them on their return to their country or to their heirs. Goods of +he subjects of either parj^y not to be sequestrated by the other party. 15. H.ither party to raeddle with or come to any agreement with any third party, whether an individual , a group pf per sons or a Government in any manner prejudicial to th? interesti of the other party. Note, ^he general sense of the original is jfbirly clear but the text requires further scrutiny 16. T h e parties, who a re bound by the ties of Islamic brotherhood and Arab origin, declare that their nations are one nation, that + hey wish no one evil and that they will endeavour +o promote the interests of the nation in tranquil lity and seek the good of their countries and their nation, without intending enmity to any nation whatsoever.

T rea ty to be called the Treaty of T a lf. Drawn up in tv;o copies in the noble Arabic lan/^uage. Conclusion. Normal except it mentions £edda as '-he place of signature. This is probably a slip of the draughtsman or the printers as the S a fcd4 Government certainly did not on this occasion apply their general principle ttet Jedda is r&amp;L the only^suitable place for diplomatic acts. j^iotocol on Arbitration ^his consists of a preamble and five articles providing for arbitration by a board to consist of an equal number of persons nominated by each side and a T^resir 4 ent to be chosen by agreemnnt, or failing agreement by balloting, between agreed candidates, or failing agreement on a list by 'urther negotiations. Annexed Letters. There are three pairs of letters recording agreement on the following subjects I- (a) The Saudi stipulation that the Treaty shall not cone In+o force perdin* fulfilment of Ibn Sa'ud's prelininary condi ions In regard to the surrender of the Idrlsls, the evacuation of the mountain area and the release of the hos tages, The ''reaty Is to be kept secret especially as re- gards frontiers (see covering despatch). (b) Arrangements In regard to the Idrlsls, with special reference to ’Abdul ’A^^Wahhab, Sharifs and other support ers of the Idrisls to be received by Ibn Sa’ud and well treated if *he elect to follow the Idrisis into his terri tory but otherwise to be expelled from the Yemen.

Further study has served little to elucidate the obscurities of Article 4 of this document, ^hese arise partly from the absence of anv trustworthy and suffici ently detailed map of the area but more especially from the rather confusing use o^ the same vord to denote the name of a tribe and at th: same time to describe its tribal grazing-ground or dira . 'these latter are more over knovn accurately probably only to the tribes o”.ing them and to neighbouring tribes, v;ho may or may not be in en+ire agreement as to their boundaries. Hntil +he terrain through whi'h this frontier runs is accurately mapped and surveyed. Article 4 will, it is believed, continue to be a somewhat unintelligible concatenation o£ place and tribal names. 3. Otherwise no points of importance, otherthan those noted by ^4r Andrew Bvan in his despatch under reference, have emerged except that Article 4 does &lt; provide for a H friendly and brotherly” delimitation of the .^rdntier, TCight Honourable, Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., H.C.V.O., etCo, etc., etc., 44.
