On the 5th instant Shaikh Hafidh bln Jahaba applied to me for an endorsement to his Certificate of Identity {Bahrain No ,1582 of 22nd November I 92 O for return to Bahrain, and, as you had deacri- bed him on it as coming here ’for visit 1 and made it available for a yea.v instead of for the voyage only, I assumed that there was r» objection to his returning and gave him the endorsement. He left here by 8 . 8 . 'Bar Jora 15 on the ?th instant, but returned by the ’’Ahmedi' yesterday afternoon. He states that on his arrival at Bahrain Shaikh dalman bin Hamad al-’Isa and Khan Bahadur Muhammad Bharlf boarded the vessel and told him that the Shaikh of Bahrain did not wish him to remain in Bahrain, and that you agreed with him in this decision. He accordingly transferred to the 'Ahinedi”, which was then in harbour, and returned to Kuwait without landing. Ha has now come to me as the oppressed British protected person, and asks to be told for what reason this decision has been taken. As is usual with this type of person, he professes the most profound love and admiration for everything British. He says that . &gt;■ : ' * V there was certainly no question of his not being allowed to return when he left Bahrain in November, and, in support of his statement, produces a paper granting him leave of absence from the school. He maintains that he can think of absolutely no reason for Shaikh 'Isas leclsion . He hints that you personally have had your mind poisoned against him by lying reports, which he fears you have believed, that he has been speaking against you regarding the case of a Persian who died a few days after having been up before you v on the charge ■ of having stolen a ring. I iipoke to Shaikh Ahmad about him when I received your telegramthat he will not be willing to allow him to live in Kuwait,should ha wish to do so, now that he has been refused permission to live at Bahrain, and, as he is certain to appeal for British protection if told to go, I shall be glad if you will give me any information about him which you can. f) A i ft lx * ~ /[/ A Major, Political Agent, Kuwait,D.O. KUWAIT. t?th January ' 9^2 I vyaa very much Interested to aee your letter No. a cf Mr January to the Foreign Secretary, Delhi, about the Kuwait Order in Council, a copy of which reached ae laat mail. I gather from what you say that a decision h^a been - or at any rate, is being - arrived at regarding Kuwait, and'that it is goir^g to come regularly under Eushire again after Sir Percy gives up the High Comaiaalonership of ’Iraq. I presume therefore that there will now be no question of its not remaining under Buehire as regards finance. If this be so, I hope you not lose s&gt;ght of the question of the replacement of the ♦'Lettis Felly r by a motor boat. I still think that one would get a better price for her by sending her to India than by attempting to sen her local! I fear,however, that the longer we wait, the less *e *ill get as, not only ia. she getting older, but 1 also fancy the Indian market will be swamped by craft from Heaopotaaia. «»hen I was in Basrah before Christmas, I saw literally dozens cf boats waiting to be towed to India, hose I actually saw were river paddle steamers, but I expect other klnua are going too.

I presume that Umm HaJam, which you mention as having been raided on the T Hh Muharram, is the same place as Umm Huwaisat in the Shiqaq. If so, I was not aware that Ibn Hallaf was responsible for this raid, as Y.E. told me on the Hth Muharram that you thought the raiders were of the Afnan section of the Dhafir, and the same was the indipendent opinion of the Divisional Adviser, Basrah, bo far as I am aware the Afnan are under bhaikh huzza' bin ’Aqqab and are not in any way connected with Ibn Hallaf. I think that H.E. the High Commissioner must also be of this opinion, as, in his letter to me on the subject to which I referred in my letter No. 55 of the 23rd instant, he only referred to the raid at Zaqiah on the l 7 th Cafar. If, therefore, Ibn Hallaf was responsible for the former raid^as well as that at Zaqiah, I shall be grateful if Y.E. , will give me further particulars so that I can inform H.E. and urge your claim for the recovery of your property.COHFIDBHTIAL.

The circumstances have been already reported to the Resident,who has approved the action talien here. Mulla Hafidh,who is extrememly anti4 British,is in th&lt; pay of Shaik Abdulla bin T Isa,the disaffected youngest son of the Ruler. Ihe latter employs him in intrigues and for writing scurrilous articles in the Egyptian and Persian press,against his eldest brother, who is heir-apparent,and incident/^ ly,against the Agency,because for various reasons which need not be gone into here,it has been our policy of late to support the heir-apparent,whose position shaik Abdulla tas- pires to usurp. % Hafidh recently left Bahrain hurriedly,because he took alarm at the deportation of an associate,and knew that his writings to the press had become known, although he has been clever enough to do it anonymously or through others.lt was never expected in Bahrain that he would return.Recently,however,Bhaik Abdulla.decided to redouble his efforts and sent* for Hafidh,without the Ruler f s knowledge.The latter | has recently become nervous of the results of his son's intrigues and fearing that Hafidh would be again emplyed by him for his Political ehds,wrote to ask me to forbid him to land.

' I have examined the nakhuda myself, and his story seems convincing. He says that he is practically certain that the baiam was one belonging to Hamad as-Saqar,. as he knows the ;;oat in question, the paint of which is old, and there are none Just me It In that part of the river. The eleven men who boarded the bum all had the ends of their kufTyahs drawn across their mouths; but oven had they not, he says that it is improbable that he would have recognised them, as, although he knows practically everyone at Mikhrak and Daurah, he rarely visits Ma^mir and knows few people there. He would recognise some of them if he saw them again chiefly by their voices, particularly the negro. After leaving the bum, the baiam first went towards the Qasbah shore, but did not land there, and, presumably when they thought they were out of sight, went back to M&amp;'amir. He says that a friend of his in MifchrSk, to whom he told the , story, said he thought Hamad as-Saqar*s faiiShs at Ma'amir were certain to be the culprits, but I think that was mere supposition. The Shaikh has spoken to me verbally on the subject and seems to be not at all sure that the nakhuda and crew, an of whom he has examined Independently, do not really know who the pirates are, and are concealing their names through fear, but personally I think this is improbable. He is going to ask Hamad as-Saqar about his baiam, and who is in charge of it. V s . i * t * . 7 /N -■'•£'' .... * ..vV: . -TelGgram (P). From Political, Kuwait. To Hi&amp;hcoma, Baghdad. No. 29-3.

Sir, God knows the love *hloh is In my heart towards the Government of Great Britain, whioh spreads the banner of Justice, protects the weak, and assists those who are oppressed. This love Is in our blood and we learnt It In the beginning from our teachers. I i*y ay oase before you in the hope that you will give it your careful consideri- tlon, not merely because it is a case of Injustice done to a subject under your protection •but because it is one of those oases which I fear may affect the relations between the Arabs and Great Britain and lead to Jiisunderstandlng aa to the good Intentions o£ Government, Gentleness and perspicacity are necessary to win over the Arab . people, but severity and force and doing what self-interested people want win never produce satisfactory results. Government has seen the results of gentleness in ’Iraq thanks to the good policy of that wise man 3ir Percy Cox. I came to Bahrain from %ypt in October Ip^Q at the request of the founders of the iduoational Sopartmont there and of the ^halkte, and was appointed Director of Education with the approval of Major Dickson.

I have the honour to refer to our conversation of a little over two months ago on the subject of a boy who had been sent to Kuwait for sale as a slave by one of the subjects of H.H. Shaikh Sir 'Abdul 'Aziz bin 'Abdur Rahman al-Faisal as-Sa'ud, Sulttan of Najd 4 Dependencies ? and whom a Somali named Musa bin Hairi of Alula/clairried'?o a recosnise as his cousin Sa'id who was stolen from his parents at Sur seven years ago and made a slave. In accordance with the instructions of H.S. the High Commis sioner I requested Y.B. to prevent the sale of the boy until such time as his identity could be established, and to this Y.E. was pleased to agree. I hava now received a reply from H.M's Consul at Muscat,whom I asked *o Inquire whether anything was known there which might assist in establishing the boy's identity, to the effect that the Local Government have no record of cases of this sort which more than three years ago and are therefore unable to help. I have not yet heard,however, whether H.E. the High Commissioner has obtained any corroboration of Musa's story. I would therefore ask Y.S. to still keep the case pending 4 sale not allow the boy s/until I hear further from H.3, unless you be prepared to agree with my opinion which is that the boy is beyond doubt a Somali, and that, as such, he is entitled to be free in that all Somalis are subjects either of H.M's Government or of her friends the French or Italians. In this latter case you might care to order him to be declared free wltnout waiting for proof of his actually being Musa's cousin, which I also believe him to be, and give a paper to that effect to his master, which I under stand would quite satisfy him as he wishes to return to his home.CONFID-yi:IIAL .

Dr. Cantine,head of the American 'Arabian Mission', (ii) Reply from Dr. Cantine dated March 21st. The correspondence arose in connection with the apparently unfriendly or at any rate injudicious attitude displayed by Dr. Harrison of the Bahrein Branch of the lission. It is understood that the latter has now proceeded to America on long leave, and Dr. Cantine has been informed that should he return to this region at the end of his furlough, he can start vith a clean slate as far as this High Commission is concerned. In view of the fact that during the War Dr. Harrison did his utmost to obtain a Commission in the British Army, through Sir Percy Cox when Chief Political Officer, His Excellency did not feel justified in pressing for his permanent transfer to another sphere of labour. Secretary to H.E. The High Commissioner for ’Iraq.The Residency, Baghdad, 31st January 1922. Bear Br. Cantine Referring to the conversation I had with you at our meeting on the 26th instant I write to confirm to you the views I then expressed in regard to Br. Harrison, from whom, I may mention, I have received a visit to-day. Having been in touch with your Mission and in ftiendly and valued intercourse with yourself and many members thereof 20 years or more, I can assure you that I have always had abundant reason to appreciate both the grea\ work that is being done and the sincere desire of the Mission as a whole to pursue its devoted labours in friendly accord with the British authorities at the stations where they are associated and to refrain from any line of conduct calculated to make difficulties for them. As regards what I might perhaps term the ill advised attitude of Br. Harrison to which I have found it necessary to take exception, it seems to me that the question is one which affects the intei ^•' of the Mission as a whole no less than it does those of the British Government in the sphere wherein 1 represent them accordingly I would prefer to deal with it in consultation with you as head of the Mission, as a matter of common interest, rather than pursue it personally with Br. Harrison whom I am content to leave to the good faith and good sense of your Mission.- 2 - A 8 regards his contri'bution to the Atlantic monthly for December 1920, now that I have seen the article 1 agree that its contents as a whole are much less open to objection than one gathered from the isolated paragraphs which first reached me but X still think that parts of it are unfortunate, particularly, for example, the views which Dr. Harrison expresses as to British aims with reference to the Caliphate,a difficult.problem irom which we have always studiously held aloof. As a general principle I feel confident that • you will be in agreement with me th^t having regard to the circumstances in which the work of your : ission is carried out, it is undesirable that members of it should pronounce upon or discuss, in the public press, the secular political problems involving the relations between the / British authorities and. the local potentates or communities amongst whom the life of your Kissionaries is ttirown.

To the Maal omrlo of Ar.blMi Maulgn. It may not be known to all of you that exception has lately been taken by the high Commissioner to a reported conversation betwsen i»r. harrison and a representative of the Government, in Fhich Br. harrison was undsrstood to have expressed himself in a manner prejudicial to British interests in regard to % Central Arabia and the Heja*. In reply Br. harrison has written at length to His Excellency submitting that there must have been a misunderstanding, and that he had not expreseed, ncr did he at all hold, the views to which exception was taken. Our missionaries will all be able, I think, to vouch for the Integrity of Br. Harrleon, and for his consistent, friendlinese to Government. Again exception was taken to an article by Br. harrieon, found in the 'Atlantic Monthly' for Becember 1920. Br.harrison admits that there are expressions in this article to which exception can be taken, and he greatly regrets th*ir publica tion. he also says that since the advice sent out from Baghdad in March 1921, urging missionaries to use the utmost care in touching upon local politics, hs has observed the same faith fully.

If Y.E. wishes them to make their statements actually before the ^adhl, I win order them to present themselves as soon as they return, and, in the mean while I am sending Muhammad bln Salih, whom Musa bin Hairi appointed as his agent in the matter while on his voyage, also ,/W Statament made by Musa bln Halrl of Alula on the 13th Rabl II 134 q A ten days before I left Alula seven years ago to go to Bahrain, ray uncle ’Abdul Karim bin Lallan made up his mind to go to Bur with his wife and son named Sa'id, who was then about five years old, and when I left for Bahrain they were in the port waiting for boat to go there. About seven months after my arrival in Bahrain I heard from people coming from Alula that my cousin Sa'id had been stolen from his parents about ten days after their arrival at Sur and that he was not found. I remained a year in Bahrain and then came to Kuwait where I have been for the last six years. Yesterday evening when several of us were sitting in a tea-shop a Somali named Husain bin Nabitah came up and said that as he was passing Nafisi's house he saw a boji playing with sime other boys whom he thought looked like a Somali by blood; he said to him in Somali ’’Are you a Somali?” At first he did not reply, but when he repeated the question, he said ”H1”, and when he then asked him his name he said 'Sa'id”. When Husain bin Nabitah told us this we went to see for ourselves, and as soon as I saw the boy I recognised him as my cousin Sa'id. Statement df made by Yusuf bln ’An of Alula on »3th Rabl' II I am a Somali 0 f Alula. When I was at home seven years ago, I heard from the townspeople, including his relatives, that a boy named Sa’ld bin ’Abdul Karim had been stolen from his parents at Sur, and that his father had petitioned our Shaikh Sultan ’Uthman, who had written to the Sultan of Muscat but had received a reply that h© could not be traced* x Went with Husa bin Halrl to 'Abdullah an-Nafisfa ho u 8 e and saw the boy whom he identified aa his cousin.

I told him that I had heard from Muscat and that nothing was kno^n of the case there, and that I was still awaiting your reply. He then volunteered the remark that he did not consider it necessary to bother about trying to prove that the boy was Musa bin Hairi's cousin at all but that it was quite enough to show that he was a Somali, as if he were that, he must be a British subject or the subject of one or other of our allies, Prance or Italy, and that as such he was entitled to his freedom.

Subsequently the statements of two or three Somalis that he was one of their race was taken by the Qadhi - Musa bin Hairi himself being still absent on a voyage - and the *boy has now been ^handed over to a friend of Musa’s, who has undertaken to look after him for him until his return. n/ 4/25No.2f/ dated 2pth April ^ 922 , H,E, Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir as-Subah, Ruler of Kuwait. A. 0 . I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 2 let Sha'ban relative to the Somali boy Sa’id. In reply I would refer to ray letter No.23? dated the 1st Sha'ban, in which I requested Y.E. to still keep the case pend ing until the inquiries regarding him were complete unless you were prepared to order him to be declared free as being a Somali and, as such, entitled to be free. I would remind Y.E. that it was at your own suggestion, and not mine, that I made this lattex proposal, as you told me verbally on the 3oth Rajab that you considered it unnecessary to wait for proof that the boy was Kusa bin Halrl's cousin, a Sj in view 0 f the fact that Soraalis are subjects either of H.K's Government or of her friends the French or Italians and consequently entitled to be free, you considered no further proof necessary than that he was a Somali. Y.E, said that the boy's master too agreed to this, and wanted the matter settled so that he could return home. Subsequently, at Y.E’s request^I ordered Muhammad bin Salih and two of his compatriots to go and make statements before the Qadhi. 'Abdullah an-Nafisi afterwards told me that the case had been settled, and asked to whom he should hand otfer the boy and I told him that I would tell Muhammad bin Salih, Musa's agent,to call for him. I was much surprised when, the following day, Abdullah an-Naflsi told me that the boy's master would not agree to hand him over. As Y.S. also agrees to his changing his mind in this manner 1 :ai i 3. sk Y * E &gt; kee P the oase pending and ttive me an H. 2 . the High Commissioner's message, which I conveyed to you verbally when the case first arose, that aitnoug h fcnere iB ilo tl ' v Det,weun i.e. and H.lt.

I wouid therefore ask you to have the boy still kept - either with Nafisi or, if he be unwilling to look after him any longer, with some other responsible person who will treat him kindly. I understand that Musa bin Hairi is now on his way froa India, and I hope that when he comes the case can be settled, so there should be very little further delay.

Congratulations to all the Mussalmans and particularly to the Committee of Mesopotamia at Tehran. After having made sacrifices for Islam for two and a half years, I have, thanks to God, attained my sacred aim. Although all the efforts made for the support of the foreigners (i.e., the British) against the interests of Mesopotamia were only carried out hy Sheikh Khazel and that as a result the British policy has succeeded to some extent, yet the people considered me responsible for these events and the cause of the British success. I in vain declared that I am opposed to the ideas of Sheikh Khazel. Fortunately, two months ago 1 proceeded to Kuwait where I gathered all the Chiefs and Sheikhs in the presence of H.H. Ibn-i-Massood. After several meetings, all the Chiefs unanimously wrote a letter to the Sheikh in the following terms:- W UP to now we were in hostile relations vith each „ t . ; j. ™ other, hut hereafter as Ibn-i-Massood has risen to defend p • .J | Islam, we have given up our hostilities and we are mos | fliOKlil willinrly prepared to support Ihn-l-Massood. ' wish to maintain your old policy, ie., support ; e British, we would be compelled to annihilate you first and then our religious enemies. Besides this letter, on my return to T oharamerah I explained verbally t.o the Sheikh all that was necessary and the latter after 5 days proceeded to Kuwait in order to discuss the matter with the people concerned. After long discussions, the Sheikh declared his wit 1 mg ness to give help and support to the movement on condition that tho matter should be kept secret, and that they should abstain for 3 months from my activities m ordei tnau .he m V | j j |; be able to make everything ready for this purpose. H.Rev.Seyed Abdul Hassan of Ispahan who was particularly M I I I 'Ml-i., i: ■: ?! ' 11 1particularly summoned for this purpose from Nejef has arrived at iCuwait and subsequently all ihose who were present took an oath that they would he united with each other and that they would give up hostilities amongst themselves. i 1 he acclesiastics and Ulemas of ^ejef as well as the Chiefs of the tribes of Mesopotamia who became aware of the matter have realized that I have rendered valuable services to Islam. Thanks to God, I have attained by object and I have no other wish in this world. The Sheikh ar&gt;d Seyed Abdul Hassan are at present at Kuwait and they will proceed in a few days to Mohammerah. We hope that the activities of all the Uussalmans will very shortly be crowned with success. As you receive regularly letters from India, you are no doubt aware of the agitations which are being carried out in that country, where the conditions are getting worse • * , *&gt; every day.* According to a letter received from Damascus « addressed to the Committee T, Zat el Ilm n , Abdul Vahed, n- Chi6f of the tribes has left for Mecca with a view to induce the inhabitants of Beymil Tahra (?) to rise against the British, and also to acquaint the Sherif of Mecca with the facts and make him allied with his ideas.

I have the honour to report the followinp instances of financial irregularities discovered in course of the audit of the Kuwait accounts for your information. (1) The Political Agent issued during the month of November 1921 supply bills for Rs.915-9-9 whereas a sum of hs.915-9-5 only was credited by him in his cash account for % the month on the same account resulting in a discrepancy of Rs .0-0-4 in the grand total. The closing balance was consequently shown less by Rs.Rs.0-0-4 than what it should have been. This mistake has since been rectified by the Political Agent after the discrepancy was pointed out by this office. (2) Again the total payment during February 1922 as per details in his cash account amounted to Rs.7152-14-6 while it was shown by him to be Rs.7152-14-4 resulting in a discrepancy of xw s.0-0-2 in t^e closing balance. These differences are by themselves petty lut they show that although the Political Agent furnished certificates on the cash accounts in either case to the effect that he personally checked and verified the closing balances, he did not actually do so as in that case the discrepancies would have come to light.

One of the robbers was caught, and G.M. (W) has lie case in hand. Kazim now tells me that four of his lighter loads if! Sand have just reached Abadan, and cargoes have been ppropriated by Dawood Suleiman. Ismail has stated to Kazim ■ the Nokhodas represented to the Customs Mudir, Fao that hey were employed by Ismail, and is said to have replied (hat he was not interested in Ismail, and endorsed their Ijuments to Dawood as consignee. If this is so, it is Bpicious, as we wrote Customs, Fao advising him of Ismail s [ontract, and asking him to give him the required assistance pass his lighter through promptly. Dawood had the lighters jischarged on his account in Abadan and received receipts from P.O.C. He offered the Nokhodas money who refused it on ie grounds tnat they were engaged by Ismail, from wnom they p received advances as follows fokhoda Mahdi - contents 10 soodrums - advance 2Q/-(4faiMt) Ra.wnnri - M 4 “ &gt; dy „ 1conC erned (Bricks, Karachi Lime, Firewood, Gatch etc.). * r e &gt; a ve made several attempts to do so with Gulf supplies (Sand, , to ne etc.) without success, partly on account of the vital necessity of maintaining a steady supply, and partly because ^ gvidence of a reliable nature against Fawood was forthcoming Fe gave Malcolm a trial for Sand but it was not successful. The quality was reported as bad, shipments arrived uncertainly. At last even Malcolm complained tnat opposition was too strong and a Contractor said to be named ^awood Suleiman was appropriating some of his cargoes. r e wrote Customs, Basrah asking them kindly to investigate the matter at Fao, wno passed the case to his Mudir for report. Tne latter now sends a monthly list of lighters reporting there which are all under name of Dawood Suleiman. The present case might lead to some reliable evidence if followed up. There would appear to be collusion between Dawood and the Customs Mudir and it has been suspected often, hthout definite proof that a similar state of affairs exists between Dawood and Sheikh Moosa. Dawood’s contracts are for 1000 tons of sand per month (up to end of r eb.) at rts. 14/- per soodrum. bOO tons of stone at Rs.6/- per ton. j / The sand figures are Abadan’s monthly requirements. -f Ismail was successful in his trial contract, it was proposed to give him at least 50 o/o of sand requirements. Before cancelling Dawood's contract it snould be remembered that a regular supply of the right quality of this Material is still of vital importance. Dawood’s influence in *tadan is immense. It is impossible to say correctly where it oe gins and ends. The adverse reports, so often received of Serial supplied by competitors, are quite probably en gineered by him; it is equally probable that he subsidises- ( 3 ) - jr&lt;^ tally clerks, and compensates himself for low quotations by short delivery. But Contractors will only take up Abadan contracts with extreme reluctance. fhile it is known that Dawood is in Abadan, and suspected that Moosa is against them, they fear too great opposition to be able to complete their contracts and even bodily damage. Ismail is endeavouring to get out of his contract now, and is prepared even to pay some monetary compensation for default of contract. I think it would be a mistake not to see him through, provided he can show convincing proof that he has made all arrangements, engaged the necessary number of lighters, etc., to complete his contract by specified dates.

In reply to your D.O. of the ^7th February 1923 . The rough Idea of the diving industry here In Kuwait is much the same as you describe at Bahrain, but it is not abused to quite the sane extent. The chief difference - and a very big one ~ Is that the crews normally £2 iinow what the pearls fetch, and consequently do get their shares approximately correct. There are, of course, some who go in for selling on the quiet, but they are well known and have such a bad name that I believe they now have difficulty in getting new blood to take on with them. Many divers are more or less permanently in debt, it is true, but by no means all. &lt;%uite a fair number of Kuwait men go in for diving without taking any advance at all, and they simply pouch half their own particular take, and dispose of the per-rls ns they like. Here in Kuwait the P.A. has nothing to do with the 'sailfah’, l&gt;ut two men who, X know, are on it - * I am not sure if there are others - are about as straight as you could get^ I should say, but they are nakhudas, and probably have a bias. J think the dirtiest thing here is the work of the financiers - also simply known as ’nakhuda’-. -u P«r cent, is their normal rate when they finance a boat, with the refusal of all pearls taken, which they can buy at their own valuationunless the borrower is iock prepared to shell out the entire amount of the loan in hard cash on the spot, which he never can. Still, the borrower knows that this will happen,and he borrows with his eyes open.

H 0 ' llfl. -s« 2-11 Bushiro, 4th July 1923. In a letter which Colonel Trevor wrote to Govern ment some time ago about Bin Baud's alleged interference in the affairjof the Trucial Coast, he said that so far there was no mention of Bin saud^ appointing an 'Amir' in Abu Dhabi - meaning by that an official representative or agent. The use by Colonel Trevor of this word 'Amir' instead of the ordinary one 'vakil n (which is also the word used in all treaties) was probably quite innocent. But Government have seized on it and put us the conyfundrum whether the word 'Amir' means the same as 'vakil'* Colonel Knox would be glad to have your opinion on the point. His own view is that 'Amir' has a widely different significs^nce from 'vakil's the latter connot ing an agent and the former a person who has actual executive powers which he has authority to oxeicise* If this is correct and the word 'Amir' is used strictly in this connection it would imply nothing less than an Major J. C. More, D.S.O., Political Agent, Kuwait.an attempt to exercise sovereignty or powers derived from sovereignty in a foreign country, which would be highly objectionable. Would you bo so good as to let Colonel Knox know what your own view is both as to the philological meaning of the word 'Amir' and the general interure- tat ion that is given to it in Arabia. ft It -J'j.D.O. So. *&gt;©-3. I^aw has aakod me to give you my opinion regarding the mean- inge of the worde 'Amir' and 'Wakll'. As I understand them, the two words are totally distinct In atoning and could never be used one for the other. Each word has two separate meanings likely to be met with in correspondence with, or about, Arab rulers:- 'Aair^ (a) a prince, (b) a governori or as it is defined in 'Muhit alrtMuhlt', which is the best Arabic dictionary there is, 'one who orders; one invested with authority over the people even if he be not of noble birth; also applied to one of noble birth even if he be not in authority ... as an example of (a), I have in front of me a visiting card of Ahmad ath-Thunaiyin 1 s inscribed in Arabic 'Al-Amlr Ahmad ath-Thunnlyan as-S&amp;'ud, min Umara Hajd'. In the sense of (b) it is the ordinary word used for 'governor”. A ruler can only appoint an 'smlr” in his own terri tories, and to say that Ibn Sa*ud h^d appointed an 'amir” in Afcu ^habi would convey to my mind that he had annexed it. ^kll' = (A) a representative or agent (in a place the ruler’s own dominions), one *10 officiates lfor a ruler during M absence). In the former sense Ibn Sa’ud describes ’Abdullah an- -afisx here, and 4usaibi in Bahrain, as his 'wakll”, and theJ *U Shaikh of Kuwait h:-a a M walill' In Boa bay, Basrah, #to. In thw 8 «ns« of (3), *»«n the Shaikh of Kuwait go«s on a vlalt to thw Shatt al” 'Arab and Basrah, ho appoints some member of thw SubSh family, normally Shaikh Hanad al-Mubarak, to act as his 'wakll', and, during hi a absence, this 'wakll' has full executive powers. Both words have other meanings in addition to those stiioh I have referred to above, but they do not affect the case in point, •il •V&amp; The Hon'ble Lieut. Colonel S. a.

The idea is, partly, to relieve you of the house rent difficulty when Quraishi returns- Do you agree to the proposal? If not, please say so, and we will leave Saleh Mohammed at Kuwait; but in that case^as my letter to you about his house rent will explain, Saleh Kuhammed may be put 'to some inconvenience end expense. Let me know as soon as you can what you wish. I take it Saleh Mohammed would have no objection in the circumstances to coming to Bushire where he would get house rent allowance. A- f J. C.

He then produced the present, which consisted of a rosary of 6? pearls. I am no Judge of the value of pearls myself, and cannot very well get it valued here, but the pearls are not uniform in size f or shape, and I fancy that as oearls go they are not of very great value. Still, the present is a very beautiful one, and I i very much appreciate the good wishes which I know accompanied it, and I should therefore very much like to buy the rosary from Government if the Resident.agrees and the price is not too stiff. May I therefore send it across for you to see and fix a price? Salyid Hamid Beg an“Na^lb (son of the late Naciib of Basrah, Saiyld Rajab) has also sent me a wedding present from Basrah which also I could not avoid accepting.

I &amp;m perfectly certain that the Shaikh of Kuwait would no willingly agree to the levy of dues on Kuwait sailing oraft fo the purpose of lighting the Persian Gulf. The Shaikh himself maintains two lights whioh are of grea aesir.t^noe to local navigation, viz. on his house at Rae AJuza mid on tho island of Naskan to the north west of Failakah (mis spelt M iiashj£n' or 'lieshdjsnl' on the aj&amp;ps).

(a; The Lighthouse at Muscat has not yet functioned and in any case Dhows rarely if ever make Muscat harbour at night so no light dues oan be expected from them. (b y The buoys at Bahrain mark the channel for steamers*, other channels exist which are used by nearly all Dhows except the largest ocean going, and in any case Dhows ao not often attempt to make Bahrain at night. (c) The steamer light maintained as a leading light on the .agency flagstaff is of more use to steamers than to KSaH- Dhows . The Shaikh maintain, two lights which are of greater use to local navigation viz. on his house at Ras ajuzah and on the island of Maskan to the north-west of Pailakah (mis spelt Mashjan or Mesdjani on the maps) . all sailing boats entering Kuwait are liable for fee of * 2 ,- harbour , ' Qukkan' or rudder money out of which the dues, known as 'Sukkan 01 Maskan light ie maintained but not the light on the Shaikhs house which His excellency maintains hxmsell as he x favourfavour any increase in the port dues. - regards the question of a genera! levy on native | craft tor light dues ! have referred t* matter to the olit -ical agents on the ^ab side and tiey all hold tie opinion, with which 1 concur, that the ,rab rulers will never volunt arily agree to such a levy. it must be remembered that i ..rub native craft have plied in the Gulf from time immemorial without lights or buoys and that the owners and nakhudas of I I such craft have never evinced the slightest desite to have lignts and buoys , and that as lap. in point of fact as they feel their way aiding the Coast such lights and buoys are of very little use to them. Apart from this the luestion arises if the f^rab rulers consented to the levy of light dues and imposed them on Arab craft, what would happen in the case of Persian craft of which there are very large numbers ? The Persian Government would never agree to the levy of dues from Persian craft for the benefit of anybody but themselves, and it would be highly invidious if Arab sailing craft had to pay light dues while Persian sailing craft did not. For the above reasons I deprecate raiaing the lues ti on with the Arab rulers at all and suggest that the idea of levying light dues on native craft may be drppped. The delay in replying is due first to the absence of a political Agent at Muscat when the memorandum -under reply was received and secondly to the illness oi that olticer almost immediately after his arrival.

The effect of the elements is seen on this building. Rain, sun, snow and rough weather hare left their mark upon the building, have denuded it of its lead plates and have been for centuries mouldering the wooden planks * The ssmo fate has befallen/ the Holy Dome of the Rock, its Pillars „ precious tiles am gift mosiacs and other precious decorations which ar* apt to fall from both these venerable and magnificent places of worship, which are the goal of pilgrimage from all corners of the globe, who como and pray under their roofs tc the Almighty (led *nd His Prophet to inspire them with Their spirits, and as is said “These are houses in which^ich the Almighty has permitted to held the prayers and to praise Eis Glorious Name morning and evening, by men who are not distracted from mentioning the name of God, by commerce or trade'. It is needless to emphasize its artistic importance. Suffice to prove its grandeur by the crowds of people who come hither from far and near to admire its beauty. You would see Easterners and Westerners, Moslems as well as non-Moslems visit it, single and in groups in met order to witness the finest example of architecture achieved by our Moslem ancestors and $ ^'appreciate it. The guardians of the Haram hah-Shefif hare observed the decay of these constructions before the great war. ard expert architects, charged with the examination of the place, estimated the cost of repairs at £ 36,000. Hard days, however, followed which stood in the way of carrying out the repairs; decay has naturally extended during the war when the cost of repairs was estimated at £ ^5,000 war When the $»£ was over and the Supreme Moslem Council constituted, the building was inspected for the third time, when the cost of its repairs was estimated ot'a minimum of £ 150,000* The Council made every endeavour to start repairs at once, lest the decay would further extend and the dangers * increase. The Council has invited to this end .he greatest experts in architecture to study the question and to pioceed -Tith the repairs. It set up, a Committee under the Presidency of Kamel M-Din Bey, the skillful architect who was immediately invited from Constantinople to take up this important enterprise. The latter responded to the onll and proceeded with momoers of the Committee to make the necessary plans and designs. Ine Council, however, supported him with such funds as were available from the residue of the local rtafcf funds, but the tiakf funds in Palestine are so scanty that they cannot satisfy even the slightest i 5 3I / slightest portion of the requirements of such a great building. The Moslem Council has, therefore, deemed it expedient to appeal to all Moslem peoples to extend a helping hand towards the preservation of this Holy Shrine which has the sympathy of three nundred million people, .and equal in the veneration and sanctification they cherish for this place, ao as to protect ' , it from de#ay and ruin. Gome to our help. Ye Moslem brethren, in this good work snd beneficial undertaking. May every individual donate what is in his power at once, for good charity is that quickly done. Remember the saying of the iilmighty: 'He who believed in God end in the last day would rebuild the Mosque of God'. May tho Almighty crown our work -with success. (Signed) Mohamed Amin Husaini.
