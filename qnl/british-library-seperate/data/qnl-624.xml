The correspondents are the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; Political Agent, Muscat (Tom Hickinbotham and Ralph Ponsonby Watts) and Saiyid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat.The letters discuss how the issuing of such a visa would be tantamount to British acknowledgement that the Shaikh of Fujairah came under the suzerainty of Muscat. In a letter the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf gives a response based on consultation of records from 1903 between the Government of India and the Political Resident. This showed that they were both strongly of the opinion that Fujairah should remain under the "Jowasmi [Qasimi] Chiefs" but that they did not want to "interfere authoritatively" in the internal disputes. The final letter in the file from the Political Resident Persian Gulf to the Political Agent, Muscat, advises a strategy to deal with the issue.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent and Consul, Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Shaikh of Fujairah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000107#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
