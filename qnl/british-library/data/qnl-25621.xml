ECCLESIASTICAL SERVICES (OMISSION ON ACCOUNT OF WAR) BILL [h.l.] [Second Reading.] Order of the Day for the Second Reading read. The LORD ARCHBISHOP of CANTERBURY : My Lords, I ask your Lordships to give a Second Reading to a Bill which is in a very real sense an emergency Bill, entitled to that name as truly as perhaps any in the long series of such Bills which have been passed during the last year. Everywhere at this moment the clergy, especially the younger clergy, are eager for increased facilities for offering themselves, even further than they at | present can, for national service. The parish clergy have already done a great deal in that matter. Looking only to the work done bv them as chaplains with the troops, I think the extent and range of it is perhaps inadequately recognised by the public. Putting aside for the moment the Navy and thinking only of the Army, the facts are as follows. At the beginning of the war there were, roughly speaking, rather less than 100 chaplains with the Forces duly commissioned. Throughout the course of the war, while the increase in the Army has gone on by leaps and bounds, the increase in the number of chaplains, both of the Church of England and of other denominations, has been commen surate at all events to some degree ; and in round numbers about 2,000 men have been commissioned in the Church of England alone. They are the very flower and pick of our younger clergy. There is no question at all that the men who are now serving as chaplains—I have testimony every week from Generals and others to this effect—are to a degree that has sur prised every one bearing their part in the responsibilities and difficulties of a great campaign after a fashion that is eliciting admiration all round. That is not only so, of course, in the case of the clergy of the Church of England. I am speaking quite as strongly of those who belong to other denominations. But thi^^means that a very large draft has been made upon the strength of the clergy who are working at home ; and as the men who are now chaplains return, their time expired, or as, as happens in so many cases, they are invalided home, or as, as has happened in a score of cases at least, they have been killed in the Service, we have to fill their places. As a matter of fact, it is estimated that if we are to provide adequately for the wastage during the coming year, we must continue to send chaplains out at the rate of about one a day. We must continue to do that during the coming year, finding, as I hope we shall, not some body or other who can do the work, but the very best of our men who will take this most responsible service in hand. But quite apart from chaplaincy work with the trpops, the clergy—and once more I say especially the younger clergy—are earnestly desirous to be in a position to bear a larger part in national service, to use such powers and attainments as are especially theirs for some branch or other of a service which is now so varied in character and increasing in variety and opportunity every day. In his speeches and letters the Director-General of National Service, Mr. Neville Chamberlain, has recognised from the first that service actively carried on in our parishes by the clergy—and I say emphatically that never was the need for the pastoral work of the clergy so great in the homes and the lives of the English people-—that this work adequately done is to be recognised quite frankly as a branch of national service, for they are promoting something without which the victory of our soldiers would be only half won. But the openings for service, as I say, are very varied, and | there are opportunities for a great many men with the qualifications that the average clergyman possesses if they can be properly spared from the national work which they are doing in their parishes. These opportunities may be divided into what we have called special service and duties wbc Here is in connectk places in f°’ tie camps, it#aids all centres roui and soon.r well carriei courage am number of lave now centres, tb are gatien ofthousan districts w lave now ofindustr be detach give then where wl highest ii of what v Besides intelligent clerical wc of the w Where gre there is tl the clergy business si with a re we are as supervisor moral hnl ordinary s numbers c people, ar also clerg- agricultuK “Pportunit country n ail dguidin (D8il150 151 Ecclesiastical Services (Omis- [ 20 February 1917 ] sion on Account of War) ML 152 ■ e ® to ls Silt- in tie -great iiciti^ ^ only !r gy of eakim “ng to gleans «tipoi f orkin| re nm i or as, e y arc media ' e been H tkeir imated ely for ®, we out at e mist coming t some- rk, k ill tab d. y wort ce moit gy-are lion to vice, to as are u otkei ,ried in ty and peecte fational n, k service by tie k nevei : of tie lie live s wort ;d quite service without vould le ings foi ied. a» at mant hat til ;hey cat nal worl shes, ided W» vice anc general service. Special service means that for which the qualifications of the clergy or ministers of religion are distinctive and marked—the promotion of the moral and religious work for which they have been trained and are set apart. At this moment there is a demand in our hospitals, both in the great hospitals and in the minor V.A.D. hospitals in smaller places throughout the countrj^for a greater number of men who can gi\^ virtually whole-time service to I what is not the least important part of the | duties which could he laid upon them, j There is then a great demand for their help in connection with home camps, and the 1 places in towns, perhaps still more than in the camps, where men are billeted, as regards all that indirect work which centres round the canteens and institutes, i and so on, which is of enormous importance and which can be obviously exceedingly well carried on by a man of sense and courage and acceptableness, as are a great number of the younger clergy. Then we have now quite a new department of demand arising from the great munition centres, the centres where munition workers are gathered together in thousands, or tens of thousands almost in some places. Some districts which were green fields a year ago have now become great humming centres of industry. We clearly want men who can be detached from ordinary parish work to give their services in places of that kind, where what is called welfare work is of the highest importance. All these are branches of what we call special service, to which the clergy would desire to be freed to devote themselves away from their own parishes to a larger extent than is now possible. Besides that, there is need for men of intelligence, activity, and education to do clerical work, not in the ecclesiastical sense of the word but in the writing sense. Where great centres of industry are placed there is this demand, and in many cases the ^ clergy are already giving aid in the business side of the work requiring a man with a ready pen and clear head. Also, we are asked specially to find men for supervisory work, not of a spiritual or moral kind at all but supervisory in the ordinary sense of that term, where large numbers of people, and especially young people, are being employed. There are also clergy who are experts in matters agricultural, and who are being offered opportunities in different parts of the country rurally of helping and supervising and guiding work of this character. There (d 873) A. is also a large demand for the help of men in secondary and higher schools, men who are not professionally schoolmasters but who can take the place in these higher schools of the professional schoolmasters who are now serving abroad. All these demands are being clamorously urged upon us, and the clergy are anxious to supply them to the best of their power. I should like to see the same thing applicable to our elementary schools. To me there is some thing ludicrous in the fact that people are bidding right and left to find somebody or other with a scrap of qualification who can go in and take the place of young teachers who have been called to the Front; but the Code, which has the force of law, says year by year that no man in Holy Orders, no minister of religion who is in charge of a congregation, can act as a teacher in an elementary school. That is almost trifling with a great problem while clergy are available all round. But I am not touching that in this Bill, or endeavouring to remove this disability. I merely mention it in passing. In face of these facts, and with the entire approval and concurrence and aid of Mr. Neville Chamberlain, we have started a Central Committee to facilitate and co-ordinate the work of the Bishops throughout England in trying to find men who can he set free from other work for the time in order to give themselves to one or other of the manifold duties I have described. But in doing that we are faced with the difficulty that the laws of Church and Realm are pretty rigid with regard to the duties of parish clergy. The law requires that there shall be services in every consecrated church every Sunday, however near another consecrated church may he to it. The law requires certain other duties to he definitely performed, which no doubt may be delegated by an absentee vicar to some one else, but which nevertheless must be carried out, and about which some arrangement is a little‘’difficult to make unless we have a relaxation of the existing obligations. And there are legal matters involved in the work of the clergy pre-eminently connected with the question of marriages about which the utmost care has to be taken, and about which the law as it stands is very rigid. We have no wish whatever—I want to make this quite clear—to ride roughshod over the existing rights of parishioners. We have no right to treat them with un- 2153 Ecclesiastical Services (Oms- [ LORDS ] sitm on Account of War) Bill. 154 fairness or to forget what I have already dwelt upon—the exceptional need which the parishioners have of due ministrations at a time like this, both in church and out of it. But I believe that in many parts of the country the churches, where the buildings are very near one another, are overstaffed for present requirements ; or, in other words, the needs of the parish ioners might be perfectly well supplied if we had the power of elastically adapting the work of the clergy to the actual re quirements of the people of those places. The clergy themselves have been fretting at the restrictions that exist, and after much council, lay as well as clerical, they have been passing resolutions on the subject. In the Convocation of Canter bury last week a resolution was passed unanimously—not a very common thing— in both Houses, asking that somehow or other the Bishops should find a mode of procuring a relaxation of the existing obligations in order to facilitate the clergy offering themselves in the way I have described, and the Bishops cannot do that effectively unless some aid is given them by Parliament passing a temporary amend ment of the law of the land. Hence, my Lords, the short Bill which is in your hands to-day. This Bill, which is entirely temporary in character, enables the Bishop of a diocese effectively to authorise the omission of any public service or duties in connection with any church. In extreme cases the church might be altogether closed for divine service, but far more commonly an arrange ment would be made for services in neigh bouring churches being combined or al ternated with one another, so as to free some of the clergy who at present may be ministering to sparse congregations, most of the men being far away. We have in our rural areas country churches which are within a mile of another country church, with small congregations in each and with a couple of young clergymen ministering to them. One would be well able to do the work of both, but under the law as it at present stands amalgamation is not' pos sible. We have still more markedly in some of our cities, especially cathedral cities, churches sometimes within a hundred yards of one another where services are going on week by week to congregations which may be larger or smaller but many of the male members of which are away. It does seem to us desirable that we should be able to set free men who are, as things now The Lord Archbishop of Canterbury. stand, enchained by obligations of that kind. The words in the Bill necessarily cover a certain number of laymen who also have obligations. In their application to church wardens there may be some difficulty. But there are other church officers who are under an obligation to do particular things from which we ought to be able temporarily to relieve them. The question off /cilitat- ing matters for marriages is specially dealt with in the Bill. An Act which was passed in the year 1824 provides arrangements whereby, when a church is either under repair or unusable for some reason of that kind, the banns may be proclaimed and the marriages solemnised in the nearest church, under proper regulations. That is an Act which we want to make generally applicable temporarily. There are details about that which I shall be ready to explain, if neces sary, in Committee. Those, my Lords, are the needs. A Bill to meet them might quite possibly have been drawn dealing with all these cases seriatim, and prescribing in each detail what should be done, but it would be a very cumbrous Bill, extremely difficult to draw, and uncertainty would have arisen in regard to the possibility that something greatly needed might be omitted. We have felt it right to take the bolder course and to ask your Lordships to give considerable power for the time to the Bishops, who shall meet the particular needs in the way that they seem to require to be met, who shall be able to release a clergyman provided it is seen that the parishioners of that man are not going to suffer seriously by his going away. The Bill leaves the elasticity of administration large. Somebody must be trusted to do this, and we suggest that the proper man is the Bishop. And I think I may say, after the discussions I have had with the Bishops, that you may take it for a certainty that the power given by the Bill will be used with common sense and with judgment, and that the Bishops will apply themselves to meet the difficulty while safeguarding at the same time the rights of parishioners. But I should like to say that if a certain measure of inconvenience, a certain measure even of hardship of a particular kind, is laid upon parishioners with regard to the ministrations to which they are accustomed and of which they would be in a measure deprived, it is only a little part of the sacrifices which at this in one ^ tieyareaw , It won them fro® your Lords poarily in the war, ' realise both the need Moved, 1 (fk Lord LoedP as a Chur Grace has the worb particular performed engaged r to take ol of the Bis! with the 1 an opportu Church in 1 same whetl in the mos country, o: palace.

The case is urgent. We have already been getting into touch with the clergy of every diocese as to what they will do. I have more than 300 returns lying at this momeijk waiting hourly the attention I want Or give to them, from men who are in one way or another telling me how far they are available for doing this or that work. We do not want this thing hung up. It would be most serious if we were obliged to refuse aid, which is greatly wanted and which can be easily given, because of not having facilities of this kind placed in our hands ; and it would be a disappointment of the gravest kind if it was stated that the clergy were to be sympathised with in their desire to under take this work, but that the law prevented them from doing so. Therefore I ask your Lordships to place this power tem porarily in the hands of the Bishops during the war, with the certainty that they realise both the gravity of the situation and the need of meeting it with common sense. Moved, That the Bill be now read 2 a .— (The Lord Archbishop of Canterbury.) Lord PARMOOR : My Lords, speaking as a Church layman I think that what his Grace has said is very satisfactory as regards the work which the clergy have done, particularly as regards the excellent work performed by the 2,000 chaplains now engaged with our Forces. I do not rise to take objection to this Bill as a whole, although the powers which it is asked should be placed temporarily in the hands of the Bishops are absolutely inconsistent with the basic principle of our National Church. That principle is that every parishioner, in fact every citizen who likes to take advantage of the services of the National Church, should as of right have an opportunity of the ministrations of the Church in his own parish ; and that is the same whether he is the humblest individual in the most out-of-the-way parish in this country, or whether he is a Bishop in his palace. His Grace has said that this right would be in substance safeguarded. I agree that this would be the case if access to a place of religious service was within the reach of every parishioner who is a member of the National Church. But that provision is not contained in the Bill as it stands. Again, the powers of the Bishop ar$ not confined by the Bill to clergymen. They extend to laymen. So far as laymen are concerned, all their legal proceedings and legal rights, during the intervention of the Bishop, are superseded and brought to an end. There is no reason whatever why laymen should be interfered with in that i way. It is not incident to the subject- matter of this Bill, the object of which ! is that the clergy should be relieved. I quite agree with that proposal, if they can be relieved consistently with their duties : as clergymen in the National Church. The need for the work of our pastoral clergy was never more important than it is at the present time. To my mind it is a good deal more important than some of I the heads of the other work to which his Grace referred. But if this pastoral work is safeguarded—and I know that this is the desire of the most rev. Primate^—of course, in that respect no objection would j arise to the provision in this Bill. i There is another important matter to which attention was not called by the most rev. Primate. The power of interference is not only in respect of the omission of all or any public services, but also the omission of all or any duties in or in con nection with any church, chapel, or other place of public worship. Those are the widest words you could possibly use. The provision would not only affect church- : wardens ; it would affect all trustees who : had to apply money for church purposes. It would affect the question of the obliga- ! tion of lay rectors. In fact, wherever there is at present a legal obligation—and they are very numerous—upon church laymen in connection with church work, it could be cancelled merely at the ipse dixit of the Bishop. I do not say that this power is likely to be unduly used, but I submit that no such power ought to be granted or is consistent with the true principles of our Church constitution. Therefore I hope that when the time comes to deal with this Bill in Committee these two points will be carefully safe guarded—first of all, that the very wide words as regards duties in connection with any church or chapel will be eliminated, or at any rate that we should know, under carefully safeguarded provisions, what is157 Irish Police and the Rebellion. 158 intended to be included. Personally I should like to be assured that in the carrying out of this Bill what was referred to as the greatest need—that is, the work of our pastoral clergy in the various parishes—will be safeguarded in this sense, that the opportunities which are now open to lay members to attend services should not be taken away from them. In my view it is all important, in a time of stress of this kind, that a right of that character should be preserved. It is of far greater importance than that the clergy should be engaged in the other work referred to by the most rev. Primate. The first duty is to see that these rights are provided for. If there is then a surplus of clergy, per sonally I would agree to their utilisation as proposed in the Bill. The LORD CHANCELLOR (Lord Finlay) : My Lords, I have had an opportunity of looking into this matter, and I certainly recommend the Bill to the favourable consideration of your Lordships. His Grace the Archbishop has explained to the House what demands have been made on the clergy in connection with the war, and we all know how nobly they have responded to those demands. A certain rearrangement of work at home is neces sitated in order that, with the diminished numbers of the clergy owing to so many being absorbed by war work, we may make the best use of those who remain, and to that purpose, and to that purpose alone as I understand it, this Bill is directed. Services and duties are to be suspended only on the certificate of the Bishop of the diocese, and probably that will be a sufficient safeguard against any dangers such as my noble and learned friend seemed to think might be possible. How ever, the Bill can be considered at a sub sequent stage with regard to the points to which my noble and learned friend has drawn attention. The Bill has been intro duced to meet a pressing need. I would remind your Lordships that we are not passing a permanent Act. We are merely providing for the emergency of the war, and as expedition is very essential I hope that we shall not give too meticulous consideration to the clauses of the Bill, which I think we may be tolerably sure will be well administered. I may say that I have been in communication with the Home Secretary on the subject of this Bill. My right hon. friend has looked into it carefully, and if the Bill should reach Lord Parmoor [ LORDS] the other House he is prepared to take charge of it on behalf of the Government, On Question, Bill read 2 a , and committed to a Committee of the Whole House on Thursday next. IRISH POLICE AND THE REBELLION. The Earl of DESART rose to^k His Majesty’s Government what has i/cn the result of the investigation which, as the House was informed on October 24 last, was then being made by the Chief Secretary for Ireland as to the question of making special grants to (1) officers and men of the Royal Irish Constabulary and Dublin Metropolitan Police injured in the perform ance of their duties during the rebellion in Ireland ; (2) the dependants of officers and men of those forces who were killed in the performance of their duties at that time. What, if any, special grants will be made in these cases, and from what dates will they take effect. The noble Earl said : My Lords, I make no apology for returning to this subject, which was discussed in your Lordships’ House on October 24 last on a Question to the same effect as that which I have placed on the Paper this evening. In fact on that occasion, in response to invitations from Lord Mayo and Lord Midleton, I gave an undertaking that I would again raise the subject at a convenient opportunity, and having regard to what took place in the debate in October last I think the House is entitled to the information which was promised it on behalf of the Government at that time. Indeed I should have called attention to the matter at an earlier date, but the change of Government made it necessary that I should put it off, and this is really the first opportunity I have had of again raising it. The subject was fairly fully debated on October 24, and answers were then given by the Government which I think I shall not be incorrect in saying did not give satisfaction to the majority of this House, and a good deal of somewhat strong com ment was made on the manner in which up to that time the men in whose interests I speak had been treated. It could not be said that when I raised the question in October I did so prematurely, because the rebellion in which the men to whom I referred were injured and in which the men were killed for whose dependants I speak,159 the Rehellion. 160 [20 February 1917] Irish Police and occurred in April. It was not until a much later date that I became aware how little had been done for one class, while nothing at all had been done for the other, and I brought the matter before the House. I do not wish to-night to repeat at any length what I said on that occasion, but I think it is desirable that I should say a few words as to how the matter then stood. I hope that before^e end of the debate to-night I shall hear t^s it now stands in a very different position. I do not think many people in this country fully appreciated what the Royal Irish Constabulary and the Dublin Metro- politan Police had to contend with during the rebellion in Ireland, and I do not think it was at all realised what was owing to the men of those two Forces. We who were interested in the Irish Police felt very strongly that these men should be treated as combatants who were wounded or fell in the service of their country, for they were as directly in the service of their country as any of our gallant sailors and soldiers who are fighting for us abroad. They had a very hard burden to bear. Many of them were in lonely barracks, not knowing what would happen next. Where they had occasion to engage in actual conflict they were in all cases outnumbered. A small force under County Inspector Smyth, in County Meath, was ambushed by a largely superior force, and this small body of constabulary was not overpowered until every man of them was wounded, while some were killed, including the county inspector himself. At Ennis- corthy eight men of the Royal Irish Con stabulary defended the Police barracks, against an attacking force which was estimated at not fewer than 400, for many hours until relief came. It is not only what these men did, but what, by their judgment and their discretion, to which all classes bore testimony, they averted. It required a great deal of discretion and judgment to move among the people at that time, when there were dangers about and no one knew how and when they might arise. When we came to inquire what had been done for the police who had been wounded and for the dependants of those who had been killed in the service of their country, we found that nothing special had been done up to October. Those who were incapacitated were entitled to receive only the maximum pensions which they could have obtained for accidental injury in the ordinary course of service in time of peace; and a man about whom I had particular information—he was injured in the defence of Enniscorthy barracks— who was said at that time to be so injured that he would never be able to earn his own living, was assigned the maximum pension which he could get on his service, £25 a year or 9s. Id. a week, to support himself for the rest of his life. There was another case of the same character in which the same pension was awarded. That was the most the men could get, because nothing special had been done in their cases. With regard to the dependants of the men who had been killed, the allow ances had been somewhat increased—I believe they had been doubled—but they still amounted to very small sums compared with what those dependants would have received had the men been injured while serving in the Navy or the Army. Your Lordships’ House was profoundly dissatisfied in October last with the position in which these men were placed. There was a very strong feeling expressed by several noble Lords that the answer given by my noble friend Lord Allendale, who then spoke for the Irish Office, was ex tremely unsatisfactory. My noble friend Lord Lansdowne then stepped into the breach and spoke for the Government, and, I am happy to say, uttered the first tribute that had been paid by any Minister to these men for their services during the rebellion ; and although perhaps I may be trespassing on your Lordships’ patience I should like, for the sake of the men, to read what the noble Marquess said. The case is much better put by him than I could put it. These were the noble Marquess’s words— “ Those of us who have knowledge of Ireland know how much we owe to that force [the Royal Irish Constabulary] even in ordinary times for their exemplary conduct, for their tact, and for the confidence which they inspire in all classes of the community; and during this lamentable outbreak they did a great deal more. They showed great gallantry and stedfastness under the most trying circumstances and under great provocation ; and I, at any rate, feel as strongly as my noble friend does that any members of that force who have suffered, who have been incapacitated, owing to the part which they took in those operations, or the dependants of those who unfortunately lost their lives during the outbreak, are entitled to be treated in a generous and liberal spirit.” Those words I was very glad to hear, and161 Irish Police and the Rebellion. 162 [LORDS] I was also pleased to hear the fact, of which I was not aware, that Mr. Duke, prior to my putting the Question on the Paper, had commenced an inquiry into these cases and was then dealing with them. I do not think, considering the date, that the inquiry can he said to have been at all premature. But it was satisfactory to learn that it was going on ; and in view of those circumstances I thought it right in October not to press my Motion, and I was permitted to withdraw it. I hope that to-night we shall receive a com munication which will show that the present Government appreciate what these men did and intend to behave reasonably and generously towards them. I hope that what they tell us to-night will indicate that we are not going to have the lesson re-taught that loyalty in Ireland does not pay. We want very much to shake that belief, which is now widespread and not without founda tion. We remember what happened at the Howth gun-running. There the officers who did their duty and endeavoured to prevent the importation of arms into Dublin—arms which, as we know now, were used against their fellow-countrymen— suffered for the performance of their duty in difficult circumstances. I hope that we shall see to some extent, by what is said to-night, that His Majesty’s Government recognise that these men must be dealt with fairly and gener ously. I undertook, when I withdrew my Motion in October last, that I would bring the subject up again. It is nearly ten months since the rebellion took place. Yet during all this time these men who were injured and the dependants of those who were killed have been in suspense as to their fate. Lord Lansdowne concluded his observations in the last debate by saying— “Let&lt;*me repeat that this investigation was taken up by the Chief Secretary of his own accord, and before there was any question of this debate to-night. I am sure no time will be lost in getting at the bottom of the matter.” I hope that time has not been lost, that the bottom of the matter has been reached, and that these men will be fairly, ade quately, even generously treated, having regard to the remarkable service they performed to the whole community at a time of great danger for the community and of great peril and difficulty for them selves. The Earl of Desart. The LORD PRIVY SEAL (The Earl of Crawford) : My Lords, as my noble friend indicated, this matter has ^ been for a long time under the consideration of the Chief Secretary for Ireland, and I hope that the statement which I shall lay before your Lordships to-night will indicate that grants and pensions have been awarded on a scale adequate to the courage and tenacity under which these nrng were either wounded or lost their Irwk The Chief Secretary when in Ireland went into each case individually with the authorities of the Royal Irish Constabulary and of the Dublin Metropolitan Police. Recommen dations were made, which the Treasury has accepted; and briefly I can state the result as follows. The pension of the widow of District Inspector Smyth, which had already been increased to £60 a year, has been further increased to £100 a year, and the pension to each of her children has been raised from £20 to £25. The pensions to the widows of Head Constable Rowe, Sergeant Rourke, and Sergeant Young, which had been raised to £30 a year, have been further increased to £50 a year, and the children’s pensions have in each case been raised from £5 to £6 5s. , per annum apiece. None of the men killed in the Dublin Metropolitan Police were married. A pension of £15 has been granted to the mother of Constable Frith, in addition to the grant of £30 already made to her, while the dependants of Constable O’Brien and Constable Lahiff have been granted sums of £55 16s. and £45 8s. in addition to the grants of £30 already made to them. These latter two sums bring up the payment to a year’s pay of the constable in each case. The decision in all three police cases has, I understand, i been generally accepted as satisfactory. The increased pension will in each Royal Irish Constabulary case date back to the original granting of the pension—namely, in the case of widows the date on which the officer or constable was killed, and in the case of men discharged on account of injuries the date on which they were actually discharged from the force. I may add that since this scale was made out one other constable has recently been certified by the principal medical officer of the force as being incapacitated in consequence of injuries received during the rebellion. His pension is under consideration at the moment.

The Earl of DESART : He was said to have been incapacitated for life. The Earl of CRAWFORD : I beg the noble Earl’s pardon ; I have the name of ConstvAJe Grace here. The pension award- able t^Riim under the Statute is £25 per annum. That pension has been doubled, the balance being met by Vote of the House of Commons. If there are any other special cases I will let the noble Earl know. The Earl of MEATH : My Lords, I am pleased to learn that the present Government have taken a different view from their predecessors in regard to the amounts which ought to be paid to these men who suffered for their loyalty, and I think that on the whole there is not much to complain of. But still, as far as I understand, the sums awarded are not equal to the sums that would be given in similar circumstances in His Majesty’s military and naval service ; and, as the noble Earl who asked this Question stated, it appears to many of us that the actions of these men were really as gallant as, and ought to be rewarded in a similar way to, those of our soldiers and sailors in fighting the enemy. I do not suppose it is possible for those who do not live in Ireland to realise what the life of an Irish constable often is in disaffected parts of the country. Those of us who live in Ireland know that during the bad times these men were practically boycotted and were not allowed to associate with any one. The people who did associate with them suffered. Even the girls had their heads shaved in some places for talking to policemen. Therefore your Lordships must understand that these men live under very hard circumstances. But they are Irishmen ; they have all the feelings of Irishmen. Yet it is almost impossible to find a case—there have been, I believe, one or two cases—of an Irishman who, when he puts on His Majesty’s uniform as a police constable, has failed to do his duty. Therefore I am very pleased to find that at last we have been able by agitation— because I do not believe it would have been done without pressure—to secure redress. The feeling in Ireland has been very strong in regard to what we consider the scandalous way in which His Majesty’s Government—not the present one, but the previous one—were treating these men. So great was the feeling of indigna tion that within a very short time I was able to collect £1,000 by means of private letters which I wrote myself, and now we have collected nearly £4,000 by voluntary subscriptions, many of them in small amounts, with which we have been able to add some little sums to those given by His Majesty’s Government. Viscount MIDLETON : Are the allow ances that have been given in all respects similar to those which a soldier, sailor, or officer of similar rank would receive if wounded in action ? The Earl of CRAWFORD : I cannot answer that offhand. The allowances and pensions paid to soldiers are settled under Royal Warrant. This is settled under the Dublin Metropolitan Police and Royal Irish Constabulary Acts. I have no reason to think there is any parity between the two sets of figures—in fact, there cannot be. I take it that these pensions are largely based on the weekly wages which these constables would obtain, whereas that clearly cannot apply to soldiers or to sailors. However, if the noble Viscount will put down a further Question, I will make quite sure. STANDING ORDERS COMMITTEE.

Viscount BRYCE : My Lords, I rise to ask the Lord President of the Council whether he can, consistently with the interests of the Public Service, give some information to the House regarding the present position of affairs in Persia. Your Lordships will not be surprised that a question of this kind should be put, con sidering how long it is since we had any information from the Government regarding the position in Persia, a subject which, of course, attracted a great deal of attention from all of us some six or eight months ago. Subject to what your Lordships will, of course, understand—that I should not think of asking the Government to make any answer upon any point which finsal in • tleoperati' successful i Isay, ^ (pite latel] to ask wh officers am ty them, making, ( ! mischief ii or ten me whether t or reducec the office] now hi ci in that ' Govemmi know wl country i safety, and Tel is the o speakiq tribes g have bee how w are dispc condition far thing that is ai he glad t he given.

One of these would, of course, be, What is the present position of our forces ; what are the points which we are occupying; and hew far His Majesty’s Government are satisfif^ with the position in which our forces stand there. We have had the great advantage of having in command there a distinguished officer, Sir Percy Sykes, who had a long experience as Consul in Persia, and I understood that the operations conducted by him had been successful up to some time ago. But, as I say, we have heard nothing about them quite lately. Furthermore, I should like to ask whether the German agents and officers and the bands hired and directed by them, who were travelling about and making, or trying to make, so much mischief in various parts of Persia eight or ten months ago, are still at work, or whether they have been either expelled or reduced to insignificance ; and whether the officers who were directing them are now in custody, either in our custody or in that of the Russian or the Persian Government. Then one would be glad to know what is the present state of the country as regards tranquillity and public safety. Are the trade routes to Isfahan and Teheran passable for caravans, and is the condition of the country, generally speaking, one of tolerable order, the wild tribes giving no more trouble than they have been accustomed to give ? I do not know whether His Majesty’s Government are disposed to tell us anything about the condition of the oil wells region, and how far things are quiet there ; but, of course, that is another topic as to which we should be glad to have information if it can well be given. Then lastly, as your Lordships are aware, many attempts were made by the German Government to endeavour to provoke trouble, discontent, and even aggression in the regions which lie to the East of Persia as far as our own Indian frontier. So far as we heard, those malignant attempts failed of any success, and those who had been expected to prove a thorn in the side of the Government of India have proved themselves perfectly loyal and friendly; but if there is anything further that can be stated with regard to what has passed or is passing there, it would add to our pleasure to hear it. Some of these ques tions, of course, relate to the future as much as to the present ; but I have no doubt that His Majesty’s Government will feel that it is only right that Parliament should be as far as possible possessed of the facts which it will be necessary for Parliament to know when the time comes for settling the various questions that will arise regarding these countries at the conclusion of the war. If we are to exercise an intelligent and well-informed judgment upon those subjects at that time, it is desirable that we should be able to follow the progress of events now, and feel our selves able to judge, from what has been passing, what is the settlement which will best give tranquillity to those countries and safety to our Indian frontier. The LORD PRESIDENT of the COUNCIL (Earl Curzon of Kedleston) : My Lords, I should be the last to deprecate such a discussion as this, raised by one who speaks not only with so much authority but with such moderation of statement as that to which we have just listened in the few remarks from the noble Viscount. This is not the first occasion that this House has provided a definite stage for the discussion in general terms of some of the more distant phases and issues of this world-wide war. I therefore welcome the opportunity that the noble ATscount has given to His Majesty’s Government of making a statement upon the matter. There is no single one among the questions which he put which did not seem to me entirely proper and suitable to the occasion, and I shall endeavour, in the course of the few remarks I have to trouble your Lordships with, to give an answer to each of them. The noble Viscount began by reminding us, with great propriety, that it is some time since there has been a discussion in this House upon Persia, or since indeed His Majesty’s Government have had any opportunity in either House of Parliament of making a statement upon the matter. I wa^ in the House on the last occasion to which the noble Viscount referred. It was, I think, at the end of 1915. The debate, I remember, was initiated on that occasion, as on this, by him, and he was replied to with some fulness by my noble friend Lord Crewe, who sits opposite, who gave a rather detailed account of the position in Persia as it stood at that moment. Since then, so far as I know, no public169 Persia. Persia. 170 [LORDS J P statement, at any rate on at all an extensive scale, has been made ; and it is indeed most desirable that the public at home, not merely those who have a direct personal interest in Persia but those who are follow ing the stages of this world-wide war in all its ramifications, should know the part played in the general scheme by the opera tions that are going on in that part of Asia. At the time to which the noble Viscount referred, when he last addressed us, the position of Persia as described by him was one of considerable internal convulsion ; the country was a prey to lawless brigand- « age ; the Swedish officers of the gendarmerie I had pretty generally sided with the cause ! of our enemies. German intrigue was rampant throughout the country, and the British Consul at Shiraz, a very capable officer, Colonel O’Connor, had recently, with the principal members of the British community in Shiraz, been arrested in cir cumstances of some ignominy and carried off to a place in the south of Persia. On the Western side there were incursions of Turkish troops and other marauders, and that part of Persia was almost in a state of chaos. That was the position as it stood in December, 1915. Rather more than a year has passed since that date, and we are now in a position, not merely to give in brief outline the history of what has passed since then—I think the noble Viscount would like something rather more than that—but to correlate the factors of the whole situation and to form some kind of synopsis of the movement that has been going on in that part of Asia during the last two and a half years, and, indeed, to place the Persian problem and the Persian situation in something like proper per spective to the phases of this war which has been extending from the shores of the North Sea to those of the Persian Gulf. It is now, I think, a matter of common knowledge that for years before this war began Germany had been plotting a dream, a dream by no means yet abandoned, of a Pan-German dominion to extend from Antwerp to the Indian Ocean. Her object in doing so is easily understood, and can be expressed in a couple of sentences. It is, in the first place, to put herself in a position of central advantage and authority in the heart of the civilised parts of Europe and of Asia ; and, secondly—and this more sinister aspect of the case directly concerns ourselves—to strike at the dominion of Earl Curzon of Kedlestov. Great Britain in India and to take from us the hegemony of the Eastern world. I do not know whether any of your Lordships have come across a most excellent little book, written by a cultivated literary Frenchman, M. Andre Cheradame, recently issued in an English translation in this country, with a preface by Lord Cromer, under the title of “ The Pan-German Plot Unmasked.” I commend that Rook to your Lordships as a succinct and aBkiirable statement of the German plot, of which I speak, in its inception and in the various stages which have so far been seen. Now let us observe what those stages have been. In order to carry out this plan, Austria in the first place is treated, to use the old Biblical phrase, as the Avashpot of the Germans ; over the States of the Balkans she must cast out her shoe ; Turkey is to be a slave so as to give the control of the Straits ; Egypt is to be menaced so as to imperil the main line of our connection with the East ; Persia must be controlled ; Afghanistan must be stirred up ; and the fanatical forces latent below the surface in the Eastern world must be organised against Great Britain. I said just now that this was a plot of no recent inception ; it dates, indeed, as far back as the year 1898, when your Lord- ships may remember that the German Emperor made a theatrical entry, in a garb somewhat resembling that of an ancient Crusader, into Jerusalem, and afterwards addressed a great meeting at Damascus, at which he summoned the 300 millions of the Moslem world to look upon him as their one and true and only friend. The principal instrument of this policy, which I am describing in general terms, was the Baghdad Railway ; that was the thread upon which, in so far as Asia was concerned, the whole policy was to hang. I have never been quite able to understand the curious 'penchant that has been exhibited by some politicians belonging equally to both Parties in this country for that scheme. On more than one occasion I have addressed, and I am afraid fatigued, your Lordships by disquisitions upon the Baghdad Railway. I congratulate myself now upon almost everything that I then said, although I recall that it brought upon me the fate of being denounced as an alarmist by my noble friend Lord Morley of Blackburn, and I think on one occasion I was gently chided by the noble Marquess who now sits opposite me, but I think that every word that others as171 Persia.

This scheme of which I am speaking was a bold and dramatic conception. It is by no means yet defeated ; and it will not be defeat^ and disappear from view until the Conferee which ensues at the end of the war. It was a plan which in all its various and local manifestations was well thought out. The agents were upon the spot with their instructions issued to them by Germany; they were plentifully, abun dantly, supplied with funds. Now let us look at this policy as it has been in opera tion during the past twelve months in Persia, because Persia, although it attracts little attention here except amongst a small body of enthusiasts who happen to be familiar with that country, was one of the principal Asiatic pieces on the board. As soon as war broke out, the German Consuls at Isfahan and the other principal towns in the country were mobilised; they had their plans of action ready ; they had their purse-strings loose. They suc ceeded in effecting a combination with a not inconsiderable number of German and Austrian prisoners, principally Austrian, who had escaped from captivity in Russian hands in the Caucasus and in Transcaspia. From various sources, mainly by the road which runs over the mountains from Baghdad, they procured a number of machine-guns and a tolerably large con signment of rifles. At one time there were quite one hundred of these German agents, lewd fellows of the baser sort, scattered about in different parts of Persia, terrorising the peaceful tribes and offering bribes to their chieftains. They further succeeded in attracting to their side a number of seditionists from India. They found a ready instrument in the Swedish officers of the gendarmerie to whom I alluded just now, and the majority of whom proved to be German agents in the thinnest disguise. They then proceeded to stir up trouble with various tribal groups and confederacies in Persia, principally the Lurs in the West and South-West, the Bakhtiaris in the centre, and the Kashgais in the South. Your Lordships know that Persia is in no sense of the term a homogeneous or unified kingdom in the sense that countries are in Europe. Persia is a congeries of tribal bands and groups animated by no feeling of loyalty to the Persian Crown. Their chieftains almost habitually are at feud with the Central Government, living in the main by blackmail, and finding in the existence of public disorder an oppor tunity for levying their blackmail, which, of course, they warmly welcome. With all these people the German agents and agitators made friends. They succeeded in establishing a powerful influence at Teheran; they seized Isfahan; they succeeded in closing the principal trade routes in the country ; they carried their operations as far East as Persian Balu chistan, in the neighbourhood of the British Indian border; and they even penetrated in small, well-organised groups into Afghanistan, where they were heard of at Herat and at Kabul, where a German deputation was kept for some months in the hope of seducing the Amir of that country from his loyalty to ourselves. Meanwhile Germany succeeded in getting another and more powerful Ally to come to her assistance in Persia. Anxious to pay off old scores against their hereditary enemy, anxious to recover and remain in permanent occupation of the long disputed territorities on the border between Persia on the West and Turkey, and taking ad vantage of the exhaustion that ensued upon the rapid, the almost too rapid, and brilliant successes of the Grand Duke Nicholas in the Caucasus, the Turks gladly in these circumstances penetrate with their armies into Persia, overran the Western part of the country, and occupied the leading towns as far east as Hamadan. There have been local oscillations and fluctuations in the warfare in those parts, but the fact remains that at the present moment the Turkish Army, although seemingly incapable of further advance, is still there and is in occupation of some thing like 30,000 square miles of Persian territority. Finally the Germans, with a truly Teutonic ingenuity, succeeded in persuading the democratic, what we would call in this country the Nationalist, Party in Persia that they were their friends. Stories were spread everywhere that the German Emperor, at some unknown time and in some uncommunicated place, had embraced the creed of Islam, and the German picJcelhaube was represented to the ignorant and innocent Persian people as synonymous with the Red Cap of Liberty. Simultaneously the Germans played upon Moslem feeling or fanaticism in every onePersia. 174 173 Persia. [LORDS] of its various aspects. Here they would he found appealing to the general Moslem feeling against Russia in that part of the world ; there they would he found inviting the Persians to look once more to the prospect of a resuscitated Persian kingdom that would revive the independent glories of the past; while in Afghanistan they would hold out hopes to the Amir, as has always been done when intrigue has arisen in that quarter, of recovering the lost territorities of the Punjab across the Indian border. The movement I have been describing reached its maximum of force about the month of August last. At that time the Turkish military advances, to which I have referred, were exercising so disturbing an influence upon the situation at Teheran that the Persian Government was on the eve of evacuating the capital. The Russian forces were disorganised by the efforts to which I have referred, the great towns in the centre of the country had in most cases passed out of the control of the Persian Government, and it would not, I think, be putting it too strongly to say that lawlessness reigned supreme throughout the greater part of Persia. Since then, during the seven months that have elapsed, there has been not merely a sensible alleviation but a steady improvement in the situation. The Russian Army in the North, under General Baratoff, has recovered its position and effectively barred the way of the Turkish Armies to Teheran. I should like to say, in passing, that I think this force of General Baratoff has in that way rendered a great, although perhaps hitherto unrecognised, service to the Allied cause, and that we have found ourselves in the somewhat strange and anomalous position of having a Russian Army acting as a successful screen of defence to our Indian dominions. Then as to the position of our Consul at Shiraz. Colonel O’Connor and the few male members of the community there who were imprisoned with him were, after eight months of harsh and rather ignominious captivity, released from their imprisonment in Southern Persia. The noble Viscount asked about the German agents and agitators to whom I alluded as roaming about the country. The greater part of these have been captured ; few are still loose, but I hope that before long we shall have got them all. It is almost incredible to think what harm a single evil-minded European, Earl Curzon of Kedleston. plentifully provided with money and operating upon the sort of elements he finds in Persia, can do, and not until we have secured all these gentlemen will the situation in those parts of the country be cleared up. Then I was asked about the position , and the work of Colonel Sykes. I was glad to hear the noble Viscount pay, in uassing, a tribute to that officer. There is ^ living Englishman who has had a closer association with Persia or the Persians for the last quarter of a century than Colonel Sykes. He is familiar with their language, their customs, their tastes, and no Englishman certainly of modern times has enjoyed a greater popularity with them. Colonel Sykes, when matters were at their worst, was despatched, with a small military column to assist him, from India. The force landed at Bunder Abbas ; it made its way in successive marches to Kerman, to Yezd, to Isfahan, and finally to Shiraz ; and this march, hitherto I think unknown and unmentioned in this country—a march 1,000 miles long, pursued in circumstances of a most arduous and at times of a most perilous character—has succeeded at each one of those stages in re-establishing order and flying again the flag of the Persian Government and the Allies. At Teheran itself we have secured the continued existence of a Government, I will not say of any great stability, because I doubt if any such thing can ever be predicated of any Persian Government, but at any rate of friendliness to the Allied Powers ; and Russia and ourselves have been constant, although I think not imprudent, in the steady financial assistance of the Persian Government in the difficult times through which it has passed. The noble Viscount went on to ask about the present military situation and what is being done with the forces which Sir Percy Sykes has at his command. The object for which he was deputed to Persia was to organise in the southern part of the country a force, denominated the South Persian Rifles, analogous to the correspond ing force of the so-called Persian Cossacks created some years ago under Russian officers in the North. This force is ul timately to attain a strength of 11,000 men. It will be a force of military gendarmerie or police, under the Persian Government but officered by British officers with Indian training and experience—a development which I have often myself pleaded for15) Persia.

The nucleus of this force was provided by the 2,300 Persian gendarmes who bad already been raised and officered by the recreant Swedes, of whMte I have spoken. The force has now b^Ri raised to 5,000 men. Sir Percy Sykes also has a military escort with him of, I think, something like 800 troops from India, and his military position is being strengthened by further reinforcements which are now being despatched from India, together with a military officer of experience in tribal warfare, who will act as his righthand man and military adviser in any operations which he may be called upon to undertake for the preservation of order in the areas under his control. A similar force of gendarmerie is also being raised under British officers in the country of the Bakhtiari tribesmen, who have been hitherto distinguished by their friend liness to the British cause. Before long I hope that Sir Percy Sykes will be able, with these reinforcements, to march forth from Shiraz, where he is at the present moment, and clear out the brigand camps and robber nests by which the country in that part of Persia is infested. As to the trade routes, the route from Shiraz to Isfahan is, I believe, open, but the routes from Shiraz to the coast have, owing to the circumstances I have de scribed, been interrupted for some time, and at this period of the year, with the snow in the mountains, as the noble Vis count will understand, some difficulty is experienced in reopening them. On the eastern side of Persia a correspond ing success has already been obtained by a force under another British officer coming from India, Major Keyes. He has suc ceeded, by a display of great energy and tact, in pacifying the whole of that un settled border. And, finally, do let me pay a tribute in speaking of Afghanistan, in which I said just now that these intrigues had made their way, to the fact that the Amir, in spite of solicitations and the offer of bribes, has, so far as our knowledge goes, remained entirely loyal to his obliga tions to Great Britain, and has declined to be seduced from that friendship either by offers from Berlin or the promised spoils of the Punjab. Before I sit down I might mention that this general clearing of the air, this im provement of the situation in Persia to which I have referred, has been materially assisted by two quite independent move ments of a military character that have been occurring outside the borders of Persia itself. The first of these is the success that has attended the recent operations of General Maude in Mesopotamia. Only a day or two ago I was telling your Lord- ships—and I dare say you have since seen it confirmed in the Press—that our forces there, British and Indian, well led, ably officered, and with fully recovered spirit and morale, have been making a series of advances which have practically driven the Turks out of all their positions on the south or right bank of the Tigris, which have resulted in casualties amongst the Turkish troops engaged that are estimated at 15,000, which have left the Turks in a position where their main position at Kut and in the trenches of Sanna-i-Yat is in danger of being enfiladed, and from which larger consequences may possibly ensue. These operations in Mesopotamia mean a great loss of prestige to the Turks in the first place, quite apart from the actual loss of lives, and they mean that increasing Turkish forces must be drawn away from the Caucasus and the North, thereby rendering the position of the Russians easier than it was, and it means a general easing of our position throughout the East. As anybody familiar with the East will know, the repercussion of events like the fall of Kut, whether as at first to our discomfiture and as now seems likely to the discomfiture of the Turks, is greater and spreads over wider areas in the East than would be the case in corresponding circumstances in Europe. The second outside group of events to which I referred as tending to help the situation is the movement of the Sheree of Mecca. That important personage, as we know, some months ago, acting as the head of the most powerful Arab tribes, threw off the Turkish yoke and assumed, with the assent of the Allied Powers, the title of King of the Hedjaz. He has taken and occupied the sacred city of Mecca, and he has established such a control over that part of the country that the Pilgrimage to Mecca was successfully accomplished by pilgrims from India and other parts of the world without molestation, and, without indulging in any too confident anticipations, one may say that he seems to be in a fair177 Persia. Persia. 178 way to consolidate the Arab world against the Ottoman Power. That, I think, is a correct review of the situation as it now exists. I cannot say that it is altogether free from anxiety. The Turkish troops have still to be turned out of the positions in the western part of Persia which I have described them as occupying. The southern part and shores of the hinterland of the Persian Gulf are still in a state of disorder. Some only of the trade routes have as yet been opened. The position of the oil wells, so far as I know, is tranquil and secure. A British force has been during the whole of these operations in occupation of Ahwaz, and I have not heard for many months past of any interruption of communications in that part of the world. There I think we are securely established. I would say this in conclusion. Nobody who knows anything about the East will ever venture to prophesy about it. The Eastern world is the grave yard of the predictions of statesmen and politicians. But I do think we may say that the worst is over ; that the particular link with Persia, as supplied in this great German chain of ambition and aggrandisement stretching from Europe to Asia has been forcibly twisted aside, if it has not been broken ; and it must certainly be the object of this country to see not merely that that link is broken, but that it is never reforged, to what would be the lasting peril of Great Britain and a menace to the whole Eastern world. The Marquess of CREWE : My Lords, the whole House, I feel sure, will be glad that my noble friend opposite did not confine himself to simply answering the questions put to him, as he himself said, with great moderation by my noble friend Lord Bryce, but that he also gave us a masterly historical survey of the events of the last year, during the whole of which, as has been pointed out, it has not been found possible to make statements to your Lordships’ House on the subject of Persia. My noble friend opposite spoke of the Baghdad Railway in terms with which I have no quarrel whatever. He stated that he had more than once called the attention of the House to the dangers connected with that project, and he said that on one occasion I had gone so far as to venture to ask him to accept a mild reproof in consequence of something that he had said. I confess I am unable to [LORDS] recall that occasion, but it must have been, I suppose, some two years ago when my noble friend was sitting on this Bench, and it is, of course, conceivable that with the greater freedom which belongs to this side of the House he may have used some expression regarding the so-called friendly Power at that time which may have caused some concern to me, if I was at the time representing the Foreign Office, gj; But I confess that I, too, have always been one of those who have regarded the project of the Baghdad Railway as one that required the closest vigilance on our part; and, indeed, in the days when we were discussing the possibility of a trans- Persian railwav I always had at the back of my mind the possibility that if such a railway were made, even on lines which our then existing general understanding with Russia made apparently safe, there was always the possible risk that the Baghdad Railway in turn might become involved with that project, and that there might be an attempt to link Turkish and German influence with any railway of the kind, and that was one of the considerations which always made me regard such a project with some aversion. Indeed, ever since the memorable speech of the noble Marquess opposite (Lord Lansdowne), when he first categorically stated that the Persian Gulf must be regarded as a definite sphere of interest to ourselves, all thoughtful persons whose interests have been in any way concerned with the East have looked on the line of the Baghdad Railway as one which needed the most meticulous watching on our part. But it is quite true—and during the period of my charge of the India Office I had many occasions to notice it—that it has been impossible to eradicate from the minds of a great number of observers in India the notion that it is necessary to look further to the North- West for the danger, and that even those who would explicitly have stated that they were not inspired by mistrust of the actions of Russia could not shake off the habit of thinking that it was from the North-West that the danger must be apprehended; and the possibility of Turkish and German intrigue did not in the past, I freely admit, receive sufficient attention from the side of India. Earl Curzon of Kedleston. fail The noble Earl, in the course of his survey, alluded to the difficulties that arose through the appointment of Swedish officers to the gendarmerie.

Perhaps it should have been more carefully- considered that the military training of the ! greater number of Swedish officers is German, and that therefore a large pro portion of them were likely to entertain a | German bias. But probably as much could ^ve been said of other neutral countries from which it might have been possible to select officers ; and in lamenting, as we do, the fact that so many of the Swedish officers proved to be purely and merely German in their sympathies, it is only fair to point out that there were a few who entirely resisted the temptation to join in German intrigues—not very many, I fear, but there were some-—of whom we should like to speak with honour. Then the noble Earl spoke of the German intrigues in Persia and Afghanistan. It is quite true, as I have always heard, that not merely in Persia or in Afghanistan but also in Arabia there have been sedulous attempts to associate the German Govern ment, and the German Emperor in par ticular, with the cause of Islam. I think it was in parts of Arabia that an enormous number of photographs or cheap engravings were exhibited representing the Emperor wearing the green turban of a pilgrim or a descendant of Mahomet. But I was particularly glad—because I was half afraid the noble Earl was not going to make it— to observe quite at the end of his speech the tribute which he paid to the conduct of the Amir throughout all these German attempts at intrigue. All the time when I was in office I was impressed by the perpetual evidence which reached the Government of India of the loyalty of the Amir to his engagements and his friend ship with us, sometimes in circumstances of extreme difficulty and under marked temptation to take a course which might have appeared easier to him at the moment whatever ultimate disaster it might con ceivably have brought upon him. jprekendetl and Gennai it. I fed? ion from tk mrse of k es tkat arcs edisk ofik® t easy wl® I wish the noble Earl had been able to tell us that the German agents in Persia had altogether been cleared out of the way, but we know the immense difficulties of hunting down, in that great and sparsely- populated country with all its brigandage, a few individuals who are able to act as a sort of leaven of conspiracy in a way which, as the noble Earl pointed out, it is exceedingly hard to conceive possible^ (d 873) But I trust that the remainder—and there cannot, I think, be very many left—may soon go the way of those who have been already captured or killed in fighting. Altogether it is gratifying to know, although ; the Turkish force is still round Hamadan, that since last August the forces of rebellion and of invasion have tended to wane ; and in spite of the wise caution which the noble Earl offered at the end of his speech against venturing to make prophecies about the East, I should hope there is nothing in the conditions as they exist to make it likely that these hostile forces will increase in power in the immediate future. It is evident, I suppose, that it is necessary to wait until our Russian Allies are in a position to send considerable reinforce ments into Northern Persia before there can be a hope of altogether driving the Turks back into their own country, because, encouraging though the successes in Meso potamia are, we must never forget the vast actual distances' which separate the different scenes of operation, using, as Lord Salisbury used to advise, large maps. Therefore we cannot hope that any suc cesses which are likely 'to be obtained on the Tigris in the near future can have more than the most indirect effect upon the condition of Southern Persia. And as regards Mesopotamia, while we have all heard with delight and with admiration of the recent successes I hope that the en couraging accounts which have been given in the newspapers will not lead the public to suppose that there are not still vast difficulties in anything like a speedy or a far-extended advance there ; and I was glad to see that the noble Earl, while saying all that was required on the subject, did not tend to give that kind of over-encourage ment which I have been a little afraid the public might be tempted to receive from some of the accounts or articles that have appeared in the public Press. I was also glad to hear what the noble Earl said about Sir Percy Sykes. That march of his from Kerman to Isfahan and finally to Shiraz is, indeed, a very remark able feat, worthy of the traditions of the Indian Army for the last 100 years or more, and 1 sincere] v hope that the nature of that feat and of the obstacles which Sir Percy had to surmount in performing it will become more recognised than, in the press of news and the impossibility of frequent publication of the various events of the war, has been possible so far. B &gt;181 Government Aircraft [LORDS] Insurance Scheme. 182 I feel that we may regard the statement of the noble Earl opposite, as a whole with great satisfaction. We cannot expect —it is not fair to expect—rapid or kaleido scopic changes in such a state of affairs as has existed for long in Persia, but it is clear that some little way is being made with the naturally limited forces that we have at our disposal when we consider how the Indian Army is employed m different parts of the world. It is clear that to send anything like a large force for the assistance of the Persian Govern ment has, from the very early days of the war, been altogether impossible, but I think we may say with some confidence that the situation ought to tend to improve, and that we need not look with any gloom upon the future, always, of course, bearing in mind the caution given by the noble Earl against undue confidence regarding what may happen in any Eastern country. the premium far too heavy a burden under existing conditions. I think myself that if the premiums had been lower probably the number of insurances effected on farm buildings and farm stock would have been very much increased. I pointed out on a previous occasion'—and I need not reiterate the argument—that the premiums were especially harsh and oppressive as regards farm buildings and farm stock, bec^ye the amount of damage actually done to faim buildings and farm- stock was really nominal, the farm buildings being isolated in different parts of the country and farm stock being seldom collected together like the plant in the case of a manufactory. If the Return is granted it will give the whole information as to how the insurance scheme of theGovernment has worked in practice. T mav sav. as regards the trouble in- Viscount BRYCE : My Lords, I desire, before the House passes from this subject, to express my thanks to the noble Earl for having given us so full, so extremely lucid, and so highly illuminative an account of affairs in Persia. GOVERNMENT AIRCRAFT INSURANCE SCHEME. Lord PARMOOR rose to move that a Return be presented to Parliament showing (1) the total number of insurances effected under the Government aircraft scheme; (2) the number of insurances effected on farm buildings and farm stock ; (3) the amount of premiums received in respect of insurances (1) and (2); (4) the amount paid in satisfaction of claims under (1) and (2). The noble and learned Lord said : My Lords, I have raised more than once the question of the terms of the Government insurance scheme in connection with air craft and bombardment damage. I have done so on the ground that the rates were based on an exaggerated fear of possible injury and were therefore fixed much too high, and I pointed out that this was a matter which might grievously affect the individual. Although the aggregate damage might be small, the damage to the individual if his own premises were affected would be extremely heavy, so that a prudent man could hardly help insuring his premises although he might consider The Marquess cf Crewe. should be unwilling to ask for any Return at the present time which was likely to put an increased burden on Offices which have already so much to do ; but this scheme was carried out through the agency of the Insurance Companies, who therefore have at their hands the statistics for which I ask. Consequently it would not be a case of throwing a burden on any of our Offices or official bodies, but merely asking the insurance companies to put in a collected shape information which they have at their disposal. I recollect suggesting that the premiums originally fixed were at least 50 per cent, too high. I am not sure whether what one has seen in the newspapers is accurate, but if it is the premiums seem to have been reduced lately to the extent of 50 per cent. Of course, that is an immense reduction in favour of the insured parties. At the same time, if we had the statistics for which I ask we should know whether this reduction was fair or not, or whether even now the premiums may not be too high in certain cases. I urge that more particularly as regards farm buildings and farm stock, because this is certainly a time when no undue burden should be thrown upon farmers. The premiums as far as they are concerned should be fixed at the lowest possible figure, particularly as no individual would like to be without some insurance and run the risk of the enormous damage that might happen in a particular case. I hope oil these grounds that the Return will be granted; tklithoitlw kbeentec Lord HI in a mome.

The House and the country know how much they are indebted to the noble and learned Lord for the great trouble he has taken in this matter ever since it first came up. He has devoted a great deal of his valuable time to it, and, as I understand, from the first his object has been very much like that of the noble Viscount, Lord Midleton— namely, to see that no waste or unnecessary expenditure either of private or of public money should take place in connection with this matter. I am able to confirm the statement to which the noble and learned Lord referred. It is the fact that from the 17th of the present month the premiums have been reduced by 50 per cent. The Earl oe CAMPERDOWN premiums under all the headings ? The Of conrsi in favouri ame time,! ± I ask i duction w &gt;n now ft rh in certai rticularly a farm stodt me wken u irown up: r as they« ; the Iowa' io individ# ae ins® 31 ’ ions damf ticular case the Ret 311 Lord HYLTON : I will come to that in a moment. The noble and learned Lord was, therefore, quite correct in his original contention that the Insurance Companies were charging too high a pre mium. On the other hand, it seems hardly fair to blame the Insurance Companies who have been employed as the agents of the Government in this matter for charging at the outset higher premiums than it is now proved were altogether necessary, because the business was an entirely new one and there was no precedent, no ex perience, to guide the Insurance Companies as to what was likely to be the loss that would fall upon them. Moreover, we did not know then how very successful our anti-aircraft methods would be as worked by the Army and Navy. It is the fact, as I mentioned just now, that on and after February 17, including those cases in which the premium had been paid prior to February 17 but had not become due until on or after that date, the rates of premium are being reduced by 50 per cent, by means of a rebate on all insurances or renewals effected on or after February 17. I am unable to accede to the request for the detailed information set out in the Motion. The noble and learned Lord said the Return would not involve any extra labour on Government servants, because the Insurance Companies—there were seventy-seven approved Insurance Companies—were acting as agents of the Government in the matter, and therefore the work that would be involved would be done by the employees of the Insurance Companies. But under the terms of the agreement entered into between the ap proved companies and the Government it was arranged beforehand that the accounts were to be made as simple as possible, because the companies pointed out to the Government when they undertook the work that their staffs were already very seriously depleted. Owing to the require ments of military service they have become still more depleted since that date, and His Majesty’s Government think it would not be fair on the Insurance Companies, after having made, so to speak, a bargain with them that only simple accounts would be required, to call upon them to present more detailed ones now. But there is another reason. His Majesty’s Govern ment may be right or they may be wrong in this matter, but their opinion is, putting on one side the increased work that would be caused in getting out the Return, that there are good and sufficient reasons why it is not desirable that it should be given. I am afraid I am not authorised to say exactly what those reasons are, but such is the view of His Majesty’s Government; and with all deference to my noble and learned friend, that is the only answer I can give him. The Earl of CAMPERDOWN : I am afraid I cannot congratulate the noble Lord upon the answer which he has just given. He began by telling us that the Government were greatly indebted to Lord Parmoor for the part which he took in the early stages of this matter. Lord HYLTON: I said “ the House and the country,” not the Government. The Earl of CAMPERDOWN : Well, the House and the country. Were not the Government obliged to Lord Parmoor ? ^ ik.185 Government Aircraft [LORDS] Lord HYLTON : I was merely stating the words I used. The Earl of CAMPERDOWN : I do not see why the distinction should be drawn between them and the country. However, the Government showed their gratitude by rejecting every proposal that Lord Parmoor and his Committee made. They departed altogether from those proposals and started a system of their own. As your Lordships will remember, when these raids first commenced the Government entrusted Lord Parmoor and a Committee with settling the question as to what sums should be paid, and they acted under that for some time. But then—why it occurred to them I do not know—the Government said they would shift the burden which they them selves had borne up to that time on to the persons who owned the premises which were injured, and in future nobody was to receive compensation for damage done by aircraft unless he was insured. Lord Parmoor, your Lordships will remember, took objection at the time to the terms which it was proposed to charge under the Government’s aircraft insurance scheme. He held that the terms were too high, and I remember at the time thinking that the premiums in respect of farm buildings and farm stock were absolutely ridiculous. If this Return were granted I very much doubt whether it would be found that any farm stock had been insured. However that may be, the noble Lord has given us no reason of any sort or kind for refusing this Return. He has said that the In surance Companies through whom these insurances were efiected were promised that they should not have to give any special Returns. But they have got these Returns. The Insurance Companies actually have this detailed information in their possession, and all they would have to do, if they were allowed to give this Return, would be to copy out the figures. Next the noble Lord told us that there are other special reasons why the Govern- 1 Insurance Scheme. 186 ment think it impolitic to give this infor mation. I listened with some curiosity t 0 know what the reasons were. Then the noble Lord told us that he was very sorry he could not state them. A more ^ ridiculous ground for refusing a Return such as this I never heard. Were this Return given it would show that the Government’s original estimate of the necessary rates of premium was wr^V from beginning to end. With regard to farm buildings and farm stock, I know that to be the case. If I remember rightly, : the damage reported to have been done was to a donkey and to a horse ; those were the only instances of which I ever heard of any damage being done to farm stock. If the House were not in its present empty state I should certainly advise the noble and learned Lord to insist on this Return. I must say I think the Govern ment are not dealing fairly with the House in refusing information which could be given without the slightest trouble. Lord PARMOOR : I thank the noble Lord opposite for the courteous terms which he used, particularly towards any work I have done in this matter, but I must say I am sorry that he is not able to give the Return. However, I cannot press the matter further, although I regret the determination of the Government. I ask the leave of the House to withdraw my Motion. Motion, by leave, withdrawn.

I have the honour to report that it was stated in the • n Nya Dagligt Allehanda' of the 23rd January last {on the authority of a paper called 'Klockan 12') that the Persian Minister in Madrid, Ismael Khan Farzaneh, had heen staying incognito in Stockholm on a mission to the Swedish Govern ment. The paper gave the following information as obtained from a Swedlsh-Perslan official in close co i uni- cation with Ismael Khan during his stay here. The Swedish-Persian gendarmerie is to he constituted on an entirely new basis, i.e., it is now to he placed directly under the Persian Government. This plan is warm ly approved by the head of the Persian Government, Vossuk- ed-Dowlch, who is said to he favourably inclined towards the Swedish-Persian gendarmerie, as also is siphadar Assam, Minister of the Interior. Siphadar Assam is said to have spent large suns out of his own pocket in furthering the development of the corps, which falls under his own Depart ment. The entire Ministry is described as friendly to the gendarmerie, and the future continuance of the corps is therefore regarded as assured. Its chief conmander is to he sajor Hans R. Lundberg, who has already heen acting commander during the absence of Colonel MystrSm. Ismael Khan is said to have concurred in the view expressed by Gwedish- The Right Honourable a. J.

Owing to the influence exerted by the inglo-Russian group in Southern Persia, even the Persian Government would not be able to secure his release. The centre of the Anglo- Russian influence is Shiraz, where the r nglish have actually formed a gendarmerie of their own, used for English ends and supported by English money. It is recruited among Indians and officered by Englishmen, with practically no Persian elements. The chief of this gendarmerie, General Craigh, is said to have offered to use his influence with the Russians for Angman's release, if the latter would take service as instructor in this corps. It is not known how Angman took this offer. Complications arising out of collisions between the, two corps need not be feared, as the sphere of operations of the English corps in Southern Persia, with its centre at Shiraz. But while the Swedish gendarmerie still extended its 'tentacles' to the south, there was a slight collision between the two, when a regiment of the Swedish gendamerie under the command of Fath-ul-Molk was disarmed by the English. (It was this Fath-ul-Molk who arrested Major Angman at the order of Colonel HystrBm). The higher command of the Swedish gendarmerie, being stationed at Teheran, found it impossible to relieve this regiment, ,ind the English were henceforth left undisturbed in their position in those districts. ASv fz- As a number of the Swedish officers have recently left the service, there are at present only eight tiwedes (not counting NystrSm) in Teheran and its neighbourhood. Four are serving as officers in the gendarmerie, viz. Majors Lundberg, Gleerup and Nordquist (vetinerary surgeon), find Lieutenant Harfvedsson. There are also four Swedes serving in the Persian police: Colonel Westdahl, as head, and the detective constables Sjbberg and Djurling in Teheran. atahlberg is chief of police at Kesht. Though the inaccuracies and misstatements contained in the article summarised above are evident at first sight, it has seemed to me worthy of remark as evidence of the attitude of the pro-German Press here towards the Persian question.

I 0, (45) It will be remembered that a few years ago the Persian Government entrusted a number of Swedish Officers with the foundation and administration of a Gendarmerie force. Thanks to the work of this Swedish Military Mi ssion, which was commanded successively by Colonels Hjalmar?.son, Edwall and Hystrom, Persia is now in possession of a small but well trained and well equipped force* It is obvious that the existence of the force 1 deplored by England and Russia, and that these two powers put every conceivable obstacle in the way of the devoted work of the | Swedes. At the outbreak of the war the latter, from a feeling of responsibility towards Persia, placed their services and the force under their command at the disposal of the Nationalists, Belgian customs officials, succeeded unfortunately in making mischief among the Swedish Officers themselves. These were reflected in the Swedish Press. this case must be attributed to the last commanding officer of the Gendarmerie, Colonel Hystrora who even went so far as to surrender Swedish officers to the Entente and to get hie former companion Angman arrested. Hystrom published a reply in the w Aftonbl^et w of thus directly opposing Russia and England. f English and Russian intrigues, seconded by the As Captain T.H. Lundberg rightly stated in the ¥ ^Sydsvenska Dagbladet” at the beginning of November, the fault inof the 17th Hovember in which he did not go into the chargee preferred against hi»eelf. but confined hiacelf to libellous attacks upon the-Swedish officers and the Persian nationalists. In order to defend the rictims of so vile an outrage Messrs Gust, Kdwall. X. Frick. Mile de Mare, K. Killander, j. Ponsette, Y. Ortengren, B. HellerA and B. Poaeelins, all Swedish officers of the Persian Gendarmerie, wrote a Joint statement on the whole matter. We consider it our duty in the interests of truth and in Justice to Persia’s cause to publish this report. The statement, the accuracy of which is Touched for by the subscribers on oath, is as full as the duty of reticence and political considerations allow: it runs as follows 'As Gendarmerie officers in Persia we had good occasion to realise the terrible manner In which England and Russia are oppressing the unfortunate country; Russia takes toe Horth and England the South. It is a type of oppression very similar to that exercised against Greece at the present time. When the war broke out we Swedes were in a very difficult position, being suspected (as Teutons) of harbouring 0 9 man sympatM a®. The result was that the Entente did its very beet to . . ,,,, thpv had already done in the case put a spoke in our wheel, as toey ^ of the American Morgan Schuster and his associates. The partial success of this plan my best be gathered. from the fact that the Swedish Government decided to recall all officers still on the active list of the Swedish Army. We remained behind, our task being to keep the shir ifloat in some way or another* Two courses were open to us:~ 1.

We all, including Kerr hyetrom agreed to take the second course. We pledged curediree hy clasped hands and our word of honour to help each other loyally in carrying out cur arduous task. A large majority of the Pereiana took our yiew of the matter. A national committee was fumed in order to attempt a solution of the problem. This committee had the majority'!** Parliament and very great powers. the situation began to be uncomfortable for the Bntente representatives; so uncomfortable indeed, that, they were obliged to resort to forcible military methods of retaining their influence, they had no hesitation in so doing. In May 1915 'English troops took possession of the busy seaport of Bush!re (on the Persian Gulf) and declared it to be occupied. Muring the summer of 191© the Russians gradually strengthened their military power in Morih lereia sc that by the autumn, she had about 20,000 imn in the town of Kaewin (14C km. froa Teheran and 225 from the sea-port of Bnseli). On the 8th Bovemher 1915 a strong Huasian detachment waa Bent out against Teheran. The position was then as follows;- Tm whole of Berth Persia up to the Teheran district was in the ponmuntm of Husoi'n troops. In Azerbaijan the acman consul was expelled from Tabriz, German private property and considerable German capital and premises seized. The English wore attempting to advance on Shiraz from th# port of Bushiro on the Persian Gulf . The Shah now decided to leave hie capital, Teheran, and go further inland, thus evading the compulsion of hostile military force. Under the pretext of rumours of proposed Armenian risings and unrest in Teheran the Gendarmerie in the barracksbarracks w«r&lt;i prepared f&amp;t action. Frick and Ho rdquiet spent the nir^ht of 14/15 th HoT«mber in the Barracks of the 2nd Eeginent. At about 6.50 a.m. Hie Majesty the Sh&amp;h telephoned pcroonally and informed Frick of hie intended departure. At 7 a.m. Col. BdwaU, then Coinmandant of the Gendarmerie, was aum'-ioned by the Shah and ordered to repair at once to the Castle. On hie arrival he was infomed that Hi® Majesty intended to leave; he was also ordered to leave Seheran himself at once; he was made personally responsible fer the safety of the Shah on the Journey from Teheran to &amp;vm. The Kneel ana were then only about 50 km. from Teheran on th*?ir advance against the capital* The Government sent out an official statement to all the Eiabae^ie»« of which the main substance was the following: *As Him Majesty, the Shah, under the compulsion of a Russian invaain* aroy. i« unable to negooiate freely with the Anhaeandore of the different tjovermenta in his Capital, he has decided to change hie residence and the seat of his Government; all Ambassadors are invitwl to follow His Majesty in order to carry on negooiatlona without the menace of foreign troops in the temporary capital which will be the seat of the Government until further notice.* Hone of us road this stmtoment* it was ropoatod to us vnrbally by an official. Immediately on receiving the Shan's command in the presence of the Prime Minister, Kdwall telephoned his instructions to all the Gendaxmerie sections in ■Teheran, and informed the Province by Telegram that H.E. the Shah had decided to leave Teheran. Herr Bdwall gave no order to the effect that Boroi*i dcclur©^ war. By the afternoon all the Gendarmerie had left the towntown with the exception of one cavalry squadron at the Gates, the Bhah* 8 escort - and Hdwall himself* who hud been ordered to follow the Shah. At the same time a Persian i'olice Officer telephoned to Brikson in Kaswin telling him that Messrs Kalistrom and hrikson were to repair imedlately to Hanadan with their Oendarraerie force. the Shah, meanwhile, had been persuaded at the last moment to remain in Teheran and this caused great confusion; rumours of the most varied description flew about the country. Most of the members of parliament* However, and also the Hational Committee, went to Kum, 130 km. south of Teheran. The excitement was so great that a few skirmishes between the advancing Russians and the Gendarmerie posts on the K&amp;swln** Kamadan road were the only sparks required to cause a general conflagration of battle to spring up. On 12th November Major hallstrom with 130 Gendarmes disarmed the Russian troops in Ham&amp;dan - about 600 men with 2 machine guns. The national, , movement spread like wild fire throughout the whole country. Immediately afterwards the Hamad an force was increased by the 7th Regiment, later by the majority of the 1st and 2nd Regiments and finally by the 4t and Sth Regiment». For some time the English had been attempting to fight their way from Rushir to Shims. The then Governor General in the latter town, Hawaii** el-Hulk was well known to be pro-Bnglieh. The greater the tension of the position the greater, if possible, became hie intrigues. Proof was found that tfc&amp;wam-el-Kulk was paid by the English to harm, weaken and indeed to destroy the Gendarmerie. The situation was dangerous. The Officer Commanding then, Angman, faced the peril and obtained proof from the English Bank that 4awam~«1-Mulk had received 173,000 Tomans (about 60&lt; ,000 kronen) from the English5'4 English Embassy in Teheran. Tiie situation in Shiras wae very favourable until the time of Myotrom*a treac , of, which we will speak later. In the north, however, the Persian troops, with the Gendarmerie as a basis and Hamadan as their headquarters, had succeeded between Hovember 1915 and 5th May 1916 in preventing the Hussian Division from attaining their object, and the last successes won in co-operation with the Turks are known to the World. With regard to the so-celled Bank looting of which the national troops were accused, this was merely ret- liation for the Huesian seizure of German capital and property in Aserbeijan. The accusations of other 'looting” may be simply ignored, as the sections commanded by the Swedes always paid regularly for all they needed, while the Russian invading army 'requisitioned” whatever there was to be had in the nameof the Shah and in the most cavalier fashion. The Persian patriots who were fighting for the independence of their country from the Russian invaders were rewarded by having their houses and property plundered and burnt down. The attacks which Herr Nystrom has now directed against the Persians aad us Swedish Officers take on quite a different aspect if we remember while reading them the part played by their author at this time. In December 1914 and January and February 1915 Hystrom, curious as it may seem in the light of to-day, was the most devoted slave of our interests; he managed the protocol and correspondence, and in the absence of the future chief, carried out .all negotiations. It was he who negotiated with the late Major Kalistrom and enabled him to apply for his discmrre from the Swedish Army in order to join us. The re&gt; • « ! v There can be no greater proof of Herr Nystroin* s zeal at that time nor, moreover of his expressed Germanophile eentinants, than the statement made by him on one occasion to the effect that, if Sweden, contrary to expectations, should join in the War on the side of the Entente he should not hesitate to open fire at the head of a German battery against his birthplace at Hassbo where hie old father was living” . Nystrom 1 s ledgers, written in his own hand, prove as clearly as can be that he himself undertook to supply funds for recruiting over and above the Budget. He carried out the recruiting with the utmost zeal during the very short time in which he was commanding in Burudjird. In order to avoid any possible discussion on this point we be; to state that these books are in our possession. In the spring of 1915 the German and Austrian ambassadors came to the Persian frontier via Asia Minor, and the Government ordered that a strong detachment of troops should escort them to Teheran. The then Major Hystrom received orders to send off the escort in question, which was to be commanded by Major de hare who had arrived at the Persian frontier at the same time as the 0 ambassadors. Nystrom, however, went himself with the escort to meet the ambassadors, without having rceived orders to that effect. Bo great was his zeal at that time. ( Shortly after, Herr Hystrom came to Teheran and handed to the German Charge d*Affaires of that time a statement previously shown to us, of his nevr attitude, that of “Heutrail ty M . Unity is strength, but Herr Hystrom had broken the Unity and thus the Entente Ambassadors had scored, a success. At that time the Entente ambassadors wished to change their Commandant in Ispahan. Their choice fell on Nystrom, but the command was not to his taste. He made one excuse after another and finally applied for leave to go home. On^6 On the one hand Herr Hystrom had really etayed, a very long time in Pursia without leave, and. on the other hand he stated that he could produce a doctor 1 s certificate to prove that he v •, extremely nervous and must go home; finally he had or ok e ii oa? agreement. His anpUcationwas therefore granted and willingly approved, although there were ^iv-eady too few of us to carry out the work which we had to'do. Moreover, Hystrom stated that he would probably remain in .Sweden, as he had been asked to re enter the Swedish Army. Anyway Wystrom went home ana reuirned to tehe-nn in the Autumn of 1915. Ho was given a co-wand at Kashan, whither he shortly repaired. He stated then tnat he would‘not work either for or against us. In the afternoon of 15th Hovember 1915 (the day. on which the Shah had intended to leave Teheran) we heard that Hystrom had telegraphed to the French Ambassador. Copies of this telegram were immediately distributed among the members of the Kntente group and caused great rejoicings in that quarter. It murt be quite obvious what the dispatch of a telegram oi that kind, which ought by rights to have been addressed to the Persian Minister for the Interior, meant to us By ©ending it Herr Kystrom cast in hin lot ngninst us. A few days later he came to Teheran, without permission and without even telling hin chief. On the way he received an-order from the then head of the Gendarmerie to the effect that he must im isdiatoly return to Kachan. Herr hystron replied by telephone that he had no designs against us and on this guarantee he was allowed to go to Tcaeran tor one day. When he arrived he promptly started negotiations wi Ui the Entente Ambassador®. But when a highly placed Persian official1 * I official adviser! him not to carry out hiplans* as he pooeeBsod neither the confidence of hi® Bwedieh comrade® nor Of the Persian Officers, he seemed to relinquish his intentions and returned to Kaehaiu A fe ,v ' days later he telegraphed hie resignation to the Government, with, the result 4 that the change® in Teheran having meanwhile taken place - ho was summoned to •Teheran by the Minister for the Interior. When Nystrom arrived at Kum, the National h Committee was there* with the real intention of taking him prisoner and sending him away via Bagdad. In Kuia ho met the Swedes Frick, Pousette and Foe eel ins and told them that the object of liis* journey wa® simply to clear up the buelnees connected with hi® resignation and private affairs. He would in any cane return to Sweden in order to re-enter the Army on the active list. Trusting to hit word* Frick made himself answer- able for his good faith* and forced the Nationalist® by prayers and threats to allow him. to continue his journey to Teheran. In order to guarantee still wore surely that if ye trom should ouft or no hindrance* Frick even seised a distinguished Nationalist leader as a sort of hostage# Nysirom arrived safely in Teheran. A few days afterwards the Capital was surrounded by Russian Troops and the Persian Government thus deprived of their indeprnoonc® and freedom of action. The Entente Ambassador® wore now master© of the situation and were able to dictate their condition©. The results were soon visible. The Persian Gendarmerie officers who had been trained in Turkey were dismissed. The national Government was overthrown and a new one set up which was favourable to the Entente. A fe- days later (on 29th December 1916) Kdwall who had hitherto commanded the Gendarmerie, was5^ dismissed and Myntvom put in hi ' place* fhe way in wnieh Hystrom treated his formr comrade Major An%m&gt;r\ lo chrr-cteri^tic of the ram. Behind Axipnm 1 v back Nysir©® handed over the. command of Bhlras to a Persian Officer Fath-el-hulk who war notorious as a regular scoundrel, and had Angraan and a few other Officer# arrested.

Also Herr Bystrova sudden return to §wo4«n f which oynohronises curiously enough with the advance of the Turkish troops into Fersla, has always been regarded by us as the sign of a guilty conscience, and was indeed to be expected.

To work on opposite system as is at present done, namely, to fix strength of Corps, or to increase it, as has recently happened, without consideration of exigencies of case, can enly lead to chaos.

Mr. Grahame’s long and intimate experience of Southern Persia and its problems gives weight to his opinion ; and the generally favourable impres sion he has received, taken in conjunction with Major O’Connor’s report and the undeniably improved conditions existing on the roads, is of interest as showing the other side of the shield. Enclosure of Serial No. 30. No. 35, dated Ispahan, the 25th December 19H. 1&gt; From—G. Geahamr, Esq., His Majesty’s Consul-General, Ispahan, To—His Excellency Sib W. B. Townley, K.C.M.G., Ills Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Having recently (viz. from 27th November to 18th December) travelled by caravan over the Bushire-Shirsz-Ispahan Hoad, with which, or with some portions of which, I was fairly familiar during my term of office at Shiraz, I venture to think that my impressions of the present condition of that road as compared with its condition during the period 1903-08 may not be devoid of interest at this moment. I have accordingly the honour to submit some observ ations thereon. It is scarcely too much to say that the Bushire-Shiraz-Ispahan Road is now the gendarmerie, so completely has that force overshadowed the road, absorbing or dissipating all other elements. Here and there a few tufangchis linger on, survivals of the former regime, now mere dependents of the gendarmerie and destined soon to disappear entirely. The local Khans have receded into the background and the local Deputy-Governors have experienced a powerful check in their treatment of the inhabitants of their districts. The Governor of the Gulf Ports replying to a notification of my intended departure from Bushire, on the 27th ultimo, informed the Acting British Besident at that place that arrangements would be made that I should be escorted from post to post all the way from Bushire to Shiraz. Except on one stage this order was faithfully carried out. The escorting gendarme or gendarmes (for often more than one accompanied me) were sometimes mounted and sometimes, viz., on the kotals, on foot. On nearing the post where they were to be relieved, these gendarmes would generally ask permission to go on ahead of me to warn their relief to be ready. There was no delay at any post and at none was any attempt direct or indirect made to extort a gratuity. On one occasion when I offered one it was refused. In most cases I questioned the gendarmes escorting me about their age, birthplace, time of service in the gendarmerie, &amp;c., &amp;e., &amp;c., thus eliciting some expression of their feelings towards their Corps. In other cases I overheard scraps of conversation between them in Tourki (a majority of the gendarmes in Ears appear to be natives of Azarbaijan or Ears tribesmen speaking Tourki), a language which they could not suspect me of understanding. There were many complaints more particulary south of Shiraz, e.g., about clothing overdue, about not being dismissed at the end of their contracts, about favouritism in promotion, about arrears of pay—these last chiefly in the tract between Bushire and Kazerun where some of the men averred that they had not been paid for three months. The feelings of the men towards their Swedish officers appeared to be universally good (Major Lundberg in the Kazerun and Captain Killander in the Abadeh district being apparently prime favourites), and towards their native officers much the opposite. I gathered both from internal and external information that many of the latter are far from the desirable s amp and that, unknown to the Swedish officers, a con siderable amount of corruption and favouritism exists.I regret the more having to record this impression, because I received great courtesy and, in some cases, an almost embarrassing hospitality from the Persian Gendarmerie officers at the posts where I halted, and some of the officers with whom I conversed seemed to be intelligent and interesting men. The organisation of the Corps in Pars territory appeared to be very complete. The gendarmes, who at almost every post turned out to salute as I passed, and those whom I came across along the road, presented a very purposelike appearance, if not up to our idea of smartness. In some cases, c. 0 ., at Burj-i-Vizhdaneh and Yazd-i-Khast, I was invited to inspect the posts or quarters. The standard of order and neatness afforded a pleasing contrast to the usual Persian neglect and laissez alter \ the arrange ments for the officers and men appeared to be good, the stabling in some cases being built and maintained on the usual Persian principle of excluding all light and air in order to secure a high degree of warmth in cold weather. In Ispahan territory the organisation was avowedly much less complete. The brand new little flags flying over the gendarmerie posts from Maqsoud Beghi northwards told their tale. At most of these posts only a portion of the unmounted contingents were on duty, the mounted men had not yet joined. On 17th December a few miles north of Qumisheh I met a party of mounted gendarmes proceeding southward to take up their duties. All along the line from Bushire to Ispahan absolute security appeared to prevail and all the local inhabitants, whom I questioned as to the outcome of the gendarmerie system, spoke of it in the highest terms, contrasting the present conditions on the road with those which prevailed before the force was established and expressing their gratitude for the enormous amelioration effected by it. I was assured that robberies had practically ceased entirely within the field of operations of the gendarmerie. The only occasion on which I h ea rd of a robbery was at Mahyar, where, in the caravanserai, I found some blocks 0 f lead—recovered as I was informed from a recent robbery in that vicinity being weighed by the gendarmes. Of the courtesy and attention received by me personally from the gendarmerie (more particularly from Captain Killander at Abadeh) in the course of my recent journey I cannot speak too highly and other Butish travellers who traversed the road about the same time as myself have spoken to me in a similar sense. I took an early opportunity of expressing to Captain Killander (now at Ispahan) my appreciation of the services of the gendarmerie. But I venture to suggest that, if you think fit, my thanks might also be transmitted to General Hjalmarson. I have recently been informed by one of the Swedish officers on duty at Ispahan that, in consequence, as he said, of the hick of support given by ie Powers to the Swedish officers in Persia, these officers have all been recal ed to Sweden, where they will report themselves on 1st March next. I furt e understand that it is proposed that the gendarmerie Oouvernementale should shortly be placed in charge of the Persian officers of that lorce. My instinctive prejudices, strengthened by the little I have recently seen and all'l have heard on the Bushire-Ispahan road, would lead me to deprecate strongly such a step as calculated to convert a force which has given proof and promise of great public utility into an instrument of danger to law and order in I ©rsiti. , . . Admitting that the Persian Gendarmerie officers may some day be raised or ra1“mselves to the requisite level of honesty and eWncy i must, I think be obvious that that day is not yet near at hand, and if all the mon y and pains which have been expended on raising the Force and bringing i- p to its present standard are not to be entirely wasted the a ™\' e E ^ r ° 0 7 e a ; nementale must continue for some time to come to be commanded by European officers. Any departure from such a course (for the present at least) spell disaster.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] 1 1-1 fpl PERSIA AND CENTRAL ASIA.

The only occasion on which I heard of a robbery was at Mahyar, where in the caravanserai I found some blocks of lead—recovered, as I was informed, from a recent robbery in that vicinity—being weighed by the gendarmes. Of the courtesy and attention received by me personally from the gendarmerie (more particularly from Captain Xillander at Abadeh) in the course of my recent journey I cannot speak too highly, and other British travellers who traversed the road about the same time as .myself have spoken to me in a similar sense. I took an early opportunity of expressing to Captain Xillander (now at Ispahan) my appreciation of the services of the gendarmerie. But I venture to suggest that, if you think fit, my thanks might also be transmitted to General Hjalmarson. I have recently been informed by one of the Swedish officers on duty at Ispahan that in consequence—as he said—of the lack of support given by the Powers to the Swedish officers in Persia, these officers have all been recalled to Sweden, where they will report themselves on the 1st March next. I further understand that it is proposed that the “ gendarmerie gouvernementale ” should shortly be placed in charge of the Persian officers of that force. My instinctive prejudices, strengthened by the little I have recently seen and all I have heard on the Bushire-Ispahan road, would lead me to deprecate strongly such a step as calculated to convert a force which has given proof and promise of great public utility into an instrument of danger to law and order in Persia. Admitting that the Persian gendarmerie officers may some day be raised or raise themselves to the requisite level of honesty and efficiency, it must I think be obvious that that day is not yet near at hand and, if all the money and pains which have been expended on raising the force and bringing it up to its present standard are not to be entirely wasted, the “ gendarmerie gouvernementale ” must continue for some time to come to be commanded by European officers. Any departure from such a course (lor the present at least) would spell disaster. I have, &amp;c. G. GBAHAME. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Major O’Connor to Sir W. Townley. Shiraz, December 10, 1914. I HAVE the honour to inform you that I have recently received from the Resident of Bushire a copy of Captain Lorimer’s letter to the address of the Resident, dated the 31st July, 1914, on the subject of the Swedish gendarmerie in . 1 ,, x :; ^ (iso. 38. Confidential.)Kerman. As the question of the gendarmerie is of great interest and importance in Kars, and is one in which, as your Excellency is aware, I have taken a special interest, I am venturing to submit to you my opinions on the subject after two years’ jgrperience in Ears, and with special reference to the remarks contained in Captain sorimer’s letter. As your Excellency is aware, I have been obliged on various occasions (notably in connection with the Kazerun affair last February) to submit to you very unfavourable reports regarding the conduct and proceedings of the gendarmes in Ears, and of certain of the Swedish officers, and at one time I was forced to the conclusion that the whole system was so unsatisfactory and so unduly expensive that it no longer merited the support of His Majesty’s Government, and this, I gather, is the opinion of Mr. Lorimer and also of the Resident, who, in his letter to the Government of India, dated the 8th September, 1914, forwarding Captain Lorimer’s letter, endorses Captain Lorimer’s opinions, and adds that his exposition of the case “ accurately voices the general opinion in the south against the gendarmes and their methods.” In submitting the case as it presents itself to me for the consideration of your Excellency, I would premise that I am in agreement with many of the strictures made by Captain Lorimer against the Swedish officers in general, and that in Ears also their conduct has in many particulars laid them open to criticism. It is regrettable, but it is nevertheless a fact, that from their first appearance in the south the majority of them have displayed a certain anti-British bias, and have either resented, ignored, or evaded all attempts of British officers to assist them by advice or otherwise. This attitude has not been due, as I venture to think, to lack of tact or consideration on the part of the British officers in the south of Persia or to any personal ill-feeling towards British officers on the part of the Swedes. It has been rather a general manifestation, due, perhaps, partly to national characteristics and sentiments (and this point of view has received marked confirmation since the beginning of the war), and partly to a not unnatural feeling of jealousy of the influential position occupied by the British repre sentatives ; and by the employes of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, &amp;c., in the south of Persia. This attitude of the Swedish officers in the south (ahd it is one which is not, I think, quite realised at Tehran) has naturally added very greatly to their own difficulties (of this I could cite many instances, from my own experience in Ears), and has alienated to a great extent the sympathy and good-will which would, I believe, have been gladly extended to the Swedes in the execution of their most difficult task. Your Excellency will, I think, realise that a constant succession of disagreeable local incidents, many of slight, and some of grave importance, especially when combined with a strong disinclination on the part of the Swedish officers to seek, or to accept, our advice and good offices, has necessarily prejudiced the consuls, and British subjects generally, in the south against the Swedes, and indeed against the whole systenp which they represent ; and that it has not always been easy for the British representatives to maintain a perfectly impartial and judicial attitude towards the gendarmerie and their work, or to criticise them from a really broad, general standpoint; and, as stated above, I was myself forced at one time to take very pessimistic views of the whole system, and was inclined to condemn it entirely. . I have, however, since then found reason to modify these views, and I will endeavour to indicate to your Excellency why I am now strongly of opinion that the gendarmerie has, on the whole, been successful m its task m South Persia, and why ^ I differ from the conclusions which appear to have been ^ arrived at by Captain Lorimer, and to have been endorsed by the Resident at Bushire. # Your Excellency is, of course, well aware of the scandalous state of affairs which existed in Ears only some two years ago. On the Bushire road, for example, practically the sole avenue for the importation of British (or other) merchandise into bars, the situation was one unheard of in any civilised (or indeed in any half-civilised) country. Every local blackguard who possessed a rifle, and every third-rate little khan along the road, considered himself at liberty to fleece the unfortunate muleteers^ as they travelled up and down the road. Every traveller was subjected to blackmail and insult, and large gangs of robbers periodically raided the road and carried off entire caravans and shot anyone who opposed them. And on the Ispahan road things were not much better, and, indeed, owing to the strength and daring or the Boir Ahmadi and other robber gangs, they were in some respects even worse. Besides this the whole province was m a most disturbed and troubled state. The Ilkhanis of the two greac nomad tribal groups had lost nearly all their power and prestige, and the tribes fought freely amongst them selves and with one another. Indeed, the situation in and round the town of Shii.°z- itself had become so serious that, as your Excellency is aware, His Majesty’s Govern ment had found themselves under the necessity of reinforcing the escort of this consulate by a detachment of some sixty infantry and by a regiment of cavalry; and, moreover, the alternative policies of despatching an expedition into the country and of withdrawing from it altogether had both been seriously considered. _ I only mention these facts in order to point the contrast between the situation which prevailed at that time and the present state of affairs. At the present moment both the north and the south roads (with the exception of a short gap north of Shiraz which will shortly be filled) are occupied by the gendarmerie, and are to all practical intents and purposes perfectly safe for the passage of travellers and caravans. Rahdari has been entirely abolished, and even the Boir Ahmadis have not ventured to raid the Bushire road since their attack on the party of the Central India Horse in December 1912 ; and it may be hoped that their raids on the Ispahan road are also a thing of the past. As regards the internal order of the province generally, the presence of the gendarmerie has had a most pacificatory effect on the tribesmen and other sources of disturbance. The conduct of the Kashgais has recently been quite exemplary, and the Kawam-ul-Mulk has succeeded in getting the Arabs pretty well in hand. And as a result of this improved state of affairs (which may be attributed directly to the presence of an ranised Government force in the province) His Majesty’s Government have been able to reduce the escort pf this consulate from some 500 men to 10. I may add that my experience during my journey to and from Tehran last summer helped also to impress upon me the value of the Swedish gendarmerie, and the helplessness of the Persian Government without their support vis-d-vis such rascals as ISlaib Hussein, &amp;c., who still at that time openly terrorised the roads within a few stages of the capital with absolute impunity. I do not, of course, wish to imply by these remarks that the gendarmerie organisation and arrangements are by any means perfect, or that no difficulties still remain to be surmounted. On the contrary, much still remains to be done, and many faults to be corrected; and the financial problem is a constant source of anxiety. But at the same time it must, I think, be now generally admitted that the work of the gendarmerie, in Ears at any rate, has on the whole been attended with markedly successful results, and has been instrumental in enabling His Majesty’s Government to free themselves (at least temporarily) from a very embarrassing situation, and to effect a considerable saving in the expenditure which they were incurring in Ears: And in view of these considerations, and of the fact that no practicable or suitable alternative policy appears to have been suggested either by Captain Lorimer or by the Resident at Bushire, or as far as I know by anyone else, I am strongly of opinion that the continuance of the Swedish gendarmerie is advisable, both from the point of view of British interests in particular, and of the good order and security of Southern Persia in general; and I venture also to recommend that they should continue to receive the support of His Majesty’s Government, whether pecuniary or otherwise, when such support is required, and until such time as the necessity may arise for His Majesty’s Government to adopt some entirely fresh policy in Southern Persia.

(13534) STOCKHOLM, January 23rd, 1915 Sir:- I have the honour to state that many of the Stockholm papers of yesterday’s date reproduce a letter addressed to the Svenska Daghladet by Major Knut Klingberg of the Persian Gendarmerie. The Major writes that when General Hjalrnarson returned to Teheran the situation was worse than ever, and the Swedish Govern ment, which was well acquainted with the circumstances, had given the order that all the Swedish officers in Persia who are on active military service should leave Persia by the 1st of March next. Beyond this the General was left a free hand to decide what should be done. General Hjalmarson, after examining the situation and discussing it with the Persian Government, came to the conclusion that the work of the Gendarmerie could be continued by reserve officers while the war lasted, and could later be resumed on the old footing if the situation improved. The Major continues that it is therefore now decided- that the officers on active service will leave Persia shortly, but that the Persian Government will not hear of their quitting the Persian service altogether, but will give them six months leave in the hope that the situation will improve in the meantime.

M. de Sazonof points out, however, that some of Swedish officers m Persia have openly manifested sympathy with Germany, and have gone so far as to spread false news detrimental to Russia and her allies, so that Sir W. Townley has been obliged to address a protest on the subject to Persian Government. Choice of which Swedish officers are to be invited to remain ought therefore to be made by two legations in consultation with Persian Government, and instructions have been sent in this sense to Russian Minister at Tehran. In conclusion, aide-memoire states that the Imperial Government must, as in the past, insist on Persian gendarmerie confining their activities in North Persia to guarding certain roads, and on their avoiding all contact with Persian Cossack brigade as well as with Russian troops in Persia.(10846) P0LITI0AT. .

He has apparently been bent on destroying a work he inaugurated so well. He has recently brought about two grave incidents. Under his orders, Swedish officers have seized revenue in provincial offices, sealed up same, and threatened the financial agents. On pretext that Russian officers had demanded that gendarmerie at Kazvin should hand over certain buildings in their possession for use of Russian troops, he has written a most insulting letter to the Russian|Minister without going through the proper channel of the Persian Government. There is reason to think that the General has also exaggerated incident, but at first it looked as if a collision between gendarmerie and Russian troops was imminent. On my being asked, I have told the Persian Government that I consider the General’s retention fraught with danger, and have advised that he should be called on to cancel his contract on the ground of health, and because he has entered into separate contract with Chinese Government [sic] without consulting the Persian Government. In my opinion he deserves dismissal for either of two above-mentioned incidents, but it is most desirable that no action should be taken of a nature to oblige the other Swedes to follow their General in his disgrace. I beg to submit that it is much to be hoped that the Swedish Government will allow MM. Folke, Carlberg, Moeller, and Glinstedt to remain here. All are anxious to do so. Folke would command, and Carlberg should do well at Shiraz, whither he wishes to go. (Secret.)

The presence of a British officer, to be associated with the new force, would doubtless be of great advantage, but it is questionable if Russian Government would ^ If you consider these difficulties can be overcome and think it imperative to have such a force, I will so inform Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs.

Evacuation was condition upon which I based my opinion that foreign community runs no risR All would be well were Russian Government to declare definitely their determination to hold North Persia in force. Failing that, I see no guarantee for security unless Russian troops are entirely withdrawn. A shilly-shallying policy based on an apparent inabilitv to withstand a Kurd-Turkish rabble, which is unsupported by any rein forcement, is held to denote a weakness which is fraught with danger for European and Armenian communities. One day Russian Minister says that evacuation has been decided upon; he contradicts his own statement next day. On 6th January Russian troops were withdrawn from Kazvin; yesterday manager of Imperial Bank of l ersia reports that they are to stop. Russians themselves scolf at Cossack brigade as a protection. As I have endeavoured to make it clear in correspondence subsequent to my despatch No. 36 1914, gendarmerie has deteriorated of late. This is due to want of money, departure of many senior Swedes, who have not been replaced, and uncertainty about force’s future. Moreover, open championship of Turco-German cause by Swedish? | officers has made many people apprehensive of loyalty of the force. Provision was made in 1913 for 300 Bakhtiaris to remain here. 1 hey did not do so because Government did not pay them. There is now no fear of collision between two forces unless gendarmerie sided against Government in a disturbance^ Bakhtiari governors, by assisting gendarmerie in provinces, have dispelled all old Bhmelin , wherefore it was not my idea that a British officer should be directly connected t Bakhtiaris, but that it would calm many anxious people if a military ma ■ _ temporarily attached to the legation. Such an officer, if he knew Persia wd could keep eye on Bakhtiaris. Since I telegraphed Prune Minister has independently sent for 500. They will strengthen the Government s hand. I do not personally anticipate any danger to European commu nty, b many people have been frightened by alarms and Turkish threats that they Mill dme Russians out of North Persia. ^Repeated to Petrograd.)701 CONFIDENTIAL.

Turkish Ambassador replied to representations of Prime Minister that he could only submit request of Persian Government for withdrawal of Turkish troops to the Porte when Russian Minister had officially announced that Russian troops would be withdrawn from all Persia. He of course argued that Turks had only come to Persia in order to rid the country of hated Russians^ Prime Minister would like to send Valiahd, accompanied by Ain-ed-Dowleh, to Tabriz, as he considers latter statesman as the only man capable of coping with difficulties of situation. He would also like to send a force of gendarmes [? as well], but he is, I think genuinely, most anxious to not to do anything calculated to wound Russian susceptibilities or to make it appear as if Government were taking advantage of situation. I discussed these points with my Russian colleague this morning. Russian Minister stated that he saw no reason why Prime Minister should not take such steps as appeared to him best when once Russian troops had evacuated Azerbaijan, and added that he was sure that departure of latter would be signal for a general spoliation of all Russian property as well as that of all friends of Russia or protected persons. I am convinced that such is by no means intention of the present Government, and that it is for express purpose of preventing* this that it is desired to send most capable politician in Persia to Tabriz. The more I see of the Prime Minister, the more convinced I am of genuineness of his assurances and of his honest desire to cany out an impartial policy. Friendship for Russia is not a crime in his eyes. If situation in Azerbaijan develops in such a way as to make it possible foi Persian Government to resume its administration, it will be impossible foi them to do much without money. I most respectfully venture to submit that it would be politic to help them in this direction. My Russian colleague has piomised^ to urge this at ) Petrograd. German Legation is lavish with offers of money, military mstiuctors, rifles, and ammunition. Impossibility of fulfilling such promises is overlooked by those who think that they see in these offers a chance to get free of Anglo-Russian yoke. We are rapidly coming to be considered as false friend, who is no more than an accomplice of Russian spoliator in disguise. , n , /r . . , . I read Petrograd telegram No. 4 of 2nd January to Russian Minister this morning. He at once said that withdrawal of Russian troops from Kazvm would be followed by departure of Russian colony from Tehran, adding that he would have to send ladies of his family away and advise his colony to leave if they sought his advice. I said that I entirely differed from him on this point. I could see no reason why Russian colony should leave, as I was sure situation here won c _)e great y improve by withdrawal. I added that things would be infinitely worse if Russian Government had to withdraw troops under Turkish pressure as at Tabriz, and that all chance of propitiating public opinion would be lost unless Russian troops are at once withdrawn from Persia, where they now only serve to irritate and alienate our friends and to provide our enemies with eloquent arguments against us. . , , 1 , p • I would venture to put on record my firm_ conviction that withdrawal of Russian troops is only measure that can now save situation, and that if they are not withdrawn we may find ourselves forced to leave Tehran at an early date Case would he different if Russia could hold North Persia in such force that Turkey could not hope t0 ^Afte? 6 my 7 conversation with Russian Minister I saw Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs.

We can rely implicitly on fidelity of Bakhtiari, and I would most urgently invite your favourable consideration to a suggestion that His Majesty’s Government should finance this force, which might serve to guarantee in our favour a situation which Russian blundering has done much to compromise. Should, as I trust, this suggestion meet with your approval, it would be desirable to have a military officer here, such as Major O’Connor, who could control discreetly the doings of the force, guarantee its being kept up to full strength, and supervise its pay. We could also count upon the services of some 200 Armenians, who have done good service in the past for Persia, are to-day devoted to Russian interests, and are better fighting men than the Bakhtiari, with whom they have often fought side by side. It would be valuable also to make use of these men s services.
