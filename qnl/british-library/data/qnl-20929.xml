Two . a paesionate desire to crush or in the alterna tive to eliminate temporarily the AJnan. This I k based partly on political considerations e.g. bad essaraple to others of rebel t^ibe being supported by British and partly on family reasons,t* e death of ■is favourite brother etc. but largely on his convic tion which he only hints at but cannot bring himself openly to confess that the presence of this openly rebellions and formidable tribe in his rear or on hi© flank ssust result in his being entirely liaaoMlised so far as active operations are concerned in any direction. From our point of view this is the most important consideration. This has been the main theme of discussion during all interviews and ua.fr.ilton and X are fully satisfied that Ibn raud will not and indeed cannot raove until his fears regarding the AJssan areare r©iaov«d imdthnt if we wexit to wake ue« of hi® w« im»treconsider our policy in ths matter this tribe.

Sixthly# We are accordingly agreed that we tnuet meet Ibn Saud halfway in order to lay a eolid foundation for the worTc of the Mission and have agreed to accept tne following oomproniae wFiich represents t) e nlnitsum demands of Ibn : . n ' £aud as finally whittled down after protr&amp;C^M argument as a working arrangeiaent to form the gild - ro cjao for action on hie part in the desired direction and to be put into force on hiffjund^rtaking in writing to take action supposing that we find hira able to do eo from the practical point of view* ncidentally he hints at his ability to do eo and it Is clear that If the gc over to enemy tv- necessary incentive would be provided for Ibn laud to attack the letter as soon ac he can mobilise hie forcee.

Tol, The Chief General Staff, Baghdad. Civil Through the Chief/Gommissioner Baghdad. Memorandum* Herewith memorandum discussing Military possibilities in Majd,summary of which has been already telegraphed in ray telegram &lt;0.8 of December 5th. £d/- F. Cunliffe Owen, Lieut.Colonel. 1. At the present moment,no measures have been apparently set on foot with a view to offensive opeEatinn^but IBn Saud seems genuinely anxious to discuss such measures and to undertake a movement,provided certain facilities are granted. S. I am unaware to what extent our policy balances the value of IbB Baud's co-opeEBtion with the provision of material and facilities for warlike operation on his part on any scale and it is difficult for me to judge as to the relative prospects of success as between him and Ibn Hashid. From the statement put forward however and the information at present procurable, Ibn Saud's chances of attaining the objective would be sufficiently reasonable,and if achieved,he would be prepared 'f should tne circumstances continue favourable,to move even tv further than ail,viz to co-operate in the general plan towards the .ejaz rail and possibly Damascus; /essential factor 3. Time is 80 ~ew55t or axT QESIffl ' and operation should commence not later than the beginning of February. Therefore, if it is considered advisable to provide what is asked for and necessary,this should be despatched with all expedition. Conversely,any demands made,which would involv- preparation or delay to any great extent,are inappropriate upon which to base any general scheme.4. as regards personnel,the effectives upon which Ibn oaud can count,are sufficient numerically,but weapons with which to arm tii® effectives are not available. From details given,it may probably be accepted that Ibn Rasnid has been fairly plentifully provided with rifles. The number given here,viz 80,000/-,are without doubt exaggerated •fc46ft,but it would be hardly safe for Ibn Saud to take the field with less than 15,000 armed men. To equip them he has received somewhat over 4000 rifles from the British Government, but these are of many patterns,not comparable in many respects with the Mauser weapons in the hands of ti'e adversary. Apart from those received from the British Government, some thousands of various patternsmay be reckoned upon in addition,but a deficit of from 5,000 to 0,000 remains which would have to be made good,together with a proportionate supply of ammunition. For choice,the pattern preferred is carbine or shofct rifle (magazine). Possibly captured iusers are most convenient for this purpose. 5. Maxims The four maxims,already given,are in store at Hofuf,but are now being brought forward. They havj never been fired or practised with and only one man remains who knows anything about t eir use. Mountain guns . Four serviceable (7.5 CM O.F. Krupp) left by the Turks,two given by the British Goverfament and one or two more of olde-r patte: pattern are distributed between Riyadh and ofuf. These guns hare likewise never been fired or practised with and their stores and ammunition have never been assembled to see what may be deficient or lacking. So one is acquainted with their proper working. Oonsequently,it is essential that,in the event of operations,a small party of trained men should be sent to get any effective use out of them. From all accounts,there are certain defences at Hail, which might require for their attack,artillery of somewhat larger calibre than the 0.P.mountain guns. The provision of such artiilery should hot necessarily delay the prose cution of operations and in this statement,Ibn Baud is in agreementagreement. But ite appearance would inspire confidence. Ibn Saud aeke for 2 heavy piecee and 2 Q.F,guns, In my • opinion, a four-gun battery of Turkish 'Mantelli 11 * guns or errItorial converted would be cufficlent,more especially as the weight of any heavier piece would prevent their transport across the desert. Wheel^ed conveyance is not pract cable,but by a system of slinging between camels,the weight of the calibre enumerated would not be too great. Here again,personnel to accompany would be necessary,and for ciioice an Arab Officer and 12 other ranks, in addition to the small party specified abovefor the maxims and mountain guns. Come personnel for guns and maximB is quite essential in any caee. 6. The pecuniary assistance,mentioned by Ibn Saud,is no doubt necessary to a certain extent for the upkeep and maintenance of his force,but continued only if Justified by results and with periodical checking of the numbers engaged. 7. As already mentioned,Ibn Saud appears to be sincere and even anxious to come to some arrangement for definite action. If it is considered liiely that his main re quire- men ts will be met,he could probably be Induced to start his preparations pending the arrival of what would be despatched. Regard must be given however to the suitable time for conduc- ting operations as previously alluded to. 8. In referring to the personnel retired for the max is* and guns,possibly a Judicious selection from among the prisoners taken from the Turks might be made. Having regard to the peculiar conditions in -ajd,it might be inadvisable to send other than Arabs.

Sir Percy Cox urged as early as Eecember that troops should be stationed at Koweit for blockade purposes as Sheikh ££ unable or unwilling to pre vent traffic. In February Sheikh agreed after considerable pressure to sending of two British Officers,four British ranks to contcol posts to Interior, Sheikh complains of injury to his prestige, P.A. reported that early in April that demands for goods from Koweit steadily increasing. In first quarter of 1918 it equalled whole of 1917. Many caravans in Koweit and others expected too numerous for Sheikh to control. Stocks in Koweit inordinately large. He pressed for British Regiment after arrival of which surplus stocks should be bought by Basrah merchant financed byGovernment. Caravans in Koweit were turned away under circumstances which you now have full information of from P.A. Many proceeded to Hasa where imports from Bahrein are abnormal. Sheikh of Bahrein has been warned: also Mail agents in all Gulf Ports privately warned to carry only limited quantities to Koweit, but neither Government of India nor Cocjmander-in-Chief Mesopotamia prepared to send battalion to Koweit. Improbable that measures taken will greatly hinder traffic, Dhows and Japanese ships bring in goods and though ^Government has already purchased 211acs stocks will purchase more this action willnot sufficiently as deplete them. Before receiving your information to effect produced in Najd I had asked Foreign to allow blockade to fall into abeyance on ground of its inefficacy and fear of quenching our relations with Sheikh of Koweit and I,S, and of relations with two last named with each2. fa^h other and with, their o wn trihesmen, I suggested maintaining 'blockade only to extent of P.A. with oo-oper- ation of local authorities could enforce.it. 0n receiving your communications I again pressed Foreign for reply.

I have the honour to enclose for your inform ation, copies of three telegrams , Nos: 4589-90-91, which I have received this day from The Chief Political Officer at Bagdad. As requested by the Chief Political Officer in his No,4591, lam writing to Bin Saud Direct on the subject, in order to save time. I have sent you out the telegrams referred to in these three messages, and have been expecting a reply each day, but I suppose there has been some delay in finding exactly where you are. I was informed a few days ago that you were to have left Riyadh on the 6th instant for Wadi Dauasir and I passed on the information to C.P.O Bagdad. If it is not inconvenient, Ishould much obliged if you would let me know of your movements, as it makes it easier to find you when I happen to have anything of importance to communicate to you from Basrah or Bagdad. I would also immediately pass on the information tothe places named. I hope you have been receiving all the Reuters telegrams and other Communiques that have been sent out to you relating to the mesopotamian campaign, such as the capture of Kifri and Kerkuk, by our troops. The following is from the 'Pioneer' of the 17th instant and will no doubt interest you. 'Mesopotamia Communique. Our mounted troops have pursued the Turks beyond KIRKUK, and on the 11th May the enemy were driven2. driven across the Lesser Zab at Alton Keupri. Thirty- prisoners and two guns were captured. The day after our aeroplanes bombed hostile campsbetween Alton Keupri and Erbil and also on the Tigris. I hope your views on the pilgrimage question will reach me in a day or two as I expect, but in any case I hope if you have not been able to send a reply as yet I hope you will do so on receipt of this memorandum with enclosures. In case you have not received my No. 79/c of 18th May, I will repeat Bagdad's telegram No. 4154, here. Telegram begins:- 'My telegram ^o. 3656, of 26th April. I sun informed that Abdul Aziz al Hassan of Kov/eit, former -ly Amir of the IRAQ HAJ, wishes permission to take the Pilgrims this year across ARABIA, from Koweit via the dSii territorials of IBN SAUD. I consider, that such a pilgrim -age under the auspices of Government, would produce an excellent impression here, and in the Persian Gulf, and would no doubt be agreeable to IBN SAUD, whom I am ask ing Philby to consult on the subject. I request your authority to announce on receipt of IEN BAUD'S views, that pilgrimage will ta^e place this year from KOWEIT to MECCA, with the approval and assistance of the Government.
