V/e should like to know, whether there is a possibility of protecting inventions in these Islands. Would the fact, that a person holds a British Patent have any favourable effect on the situation? If there has been nothing done up till now, in order to protect inventions in these Islands, v /e should like to know, v /hether ) i there is a Newspaper or other publication published in the Bahrein Islands or circulated there in which a notice could * be published to the effect that the invention had been patented in the United Kingdom, thereby securing a date of priority should a lav/ be enacted.

For your information we have to state that the said trade mark label is registered in this country under Registratisi Hp.1135 of 1939. Will you please reconsider the matter favourably.

Trade marks have, however, for many yeare been registered at the Agency on receipt of an application accompanied by 3 copies of the trade mark. A fee of fe.2/8/- la charged for each regis tration. Thereafter,protection is afforded oy Article 28 of the Bahrain Order-in-Council and Sections 487 to 489 of the Indian i^nal Code. However, in the absence of the application of an Act to Bahrain providing for the Registration of Trade Marks, the registration at present carried out in the Agency probably has no legal effect. On the other hand, it is not entirely without advantage, since the fact that •registration* nas been made in the Agency could be used as evidence of intention in a case fender Section 487 of the Indian P«nal Code. •':? ■■■ ATTiSi^M jcretary to the Bplitical Heaident in the Persian Gulf.

N.Delhi Subject: Trade Marks. I have the honour to forward a copy of a letter received from the Political Agent, Muscat, and to request that legal opinion may be taken on the point of law raised and the result communicated to this office, 2. The question of what legal protection is in fact given to individuals who register their trade marks at our Agencies, in the Gulf has been raised at various times but no authoritative ruling has been laid down, frade marks have been registered for some time in the ^ahrain Agency at a charge of Es,2/8/- each on receipt of an appli cation accompanied by 3 copies of the trade mark which it is desired to register. The question at issue is how far this registration gives protection. It may be argued that protection is afforded in Bahrain by Article 28 of the Bahrain Order-in-Council taken in conjunction with sectiora 487 to 489 of the Indian Penal Code and that similar pro tection is afforded in Muscat by Article 30 of the Muscat Order-in-Council, 1939, - But on the other hand it appears doubtful whether the fact of registration would assist a prosecution for infringement of a trade mark beyond consti tuting evidence of intention in a case under Section 487 of the Indian Penal Code, However, an authoritative opinion is requested both on the individual case referred by Political Agent, Muscat and on the general question of the protection afforded by the Orders-in-Coimcil in con -junction with the Indian Penal Code in the gulf States.No.2128-N/43. / IM x i rom The Deputy Secretary to the Govt.of India in the External Affairs Department, To The Hon 'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain.

Sir, ('$?• I-am directed to refer to your letter No 172-18/164, dated the 3rd Pehruary 1943,and to say that ajpart from the articles of the Bahrain Order in Council and the Muscat Order in 'Council cnoted, the I.P .O. runs in 'both the places, and under the relevaiat sections of the Code it is not necessary for a mark to he 'registered' for a criminal offence in rel ation to it to 'be committee . So far therefore as criminal proceedings provide a protection, protection seems to exist. . jv- 2. 'The question of civil relief is however more oibscure. It is stated that a sjrstem of registration is in vogue, hut it is not clear under what provision of la fr,since the Indian Registration Act/Is not in force in these places. Unless the Registration has a lega 1 'basis, it would seem that there exists no remedy in an action for infringement of a registration mark. An action for passing off under common law wouljLi however appear to lie (as opposed to an action for eh infringement) hut here it. is necessary to prove that iactual damage has accrued from the passing off. 3 The Government of India would be glad to know the t^is for the existing system of registration, and whether there have been any claims for civil relief of such a 'registered' mark or of any other, and how they resulted.

Dear Sir; MANCHESTER LANCASHIRE COTTON PIECEGOODS. I beg to inform you that prior to the outbreak the war I was importing purely Manchester Lancashire cotton piecegoods suitable for Bahrain market. Prom 1938 my imports were decreasing because of the fact that Manchester designs were being copied by the Japanease and were being sold at prices less than 50 to 70$ on the Manchester | prices® If the Manchester designs were registered for this market , there would have not been a tremendous gap of f. nnchester goods at Bahrain. Por the safeguard of the future business in Manchester Fiecegoods in Bahrain, I understand that 1r the designs are registered in Bahrain, it would be of interest and assistance to the Manchester Manufacturers. Attached herewith please find three cuttings of TURKEY RED YELLOW PRINTS' and requesting you to register these three designs for Bahrain Market either in favour of me or the original manufacturers in Manchester. If this step is taken from now, I can place order for the present and very decent order atter the war. These three designs are being used largely by all class of people in all seasons. In 1938-39 I brought the Japanease copying works to lv he notice of the then H.B.M's Political Agent and to my Principal Mr.J.M.Shasha. Asia House, 82 Princess Street, Manchester 1., but I do not know about the resuit» read one article IN PAGE NO.17 UNDER HEADING 'LANCASHIRE COTTON GOODS POR OVERSEA MARKETS' IN ' THE TIMES WEEKLY EDITION. LONDON, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1943, under which suitable designs are called for particular markets. I am dealing in Manchester Piecegoods since 1908 and thus I can give some idea with some samples suitable for Bahrain market and I would feel myself glad if you kindly let me know to whom I can give my report and samples If your honour like to understand more on this matter I shall be glad to explain verbally.

Nevv Delhi, the January, 1944. Subject: &gt; Marjss • • • # • Sir, I am directed to refer to your letter Ho. 2061-18/164, datied the 9th December 1943 and to say that as the Government of India have already observed, the provisions of the Indian Penal God b relating to criminal piracy of trade marks (and such marks need not be regis jered to attract those provisions) run in botn Bahrain and Muscat, so that a person offends those provisions at his peril. N %• . • ■ 2. In regard to civil remedies, the Government of India have little doubt that actions for 'passing off! under the common law could be sustained in these territories. No system or registration is necessary for relief to be obtainable in such • actions. The risiit in a trade mark derives fundamentally from ezelusive use am it may be mentioned that British Inaia has managed without registration until 10 months ago. 3. The answer to the question in Mr. Kettaneh's letter of 7th November 1943, a copy of which was enclosed with your letter No. 172-18/164, dated the 3rd February 1943, would in Muscat appear to be in the negative, the second part of the. question not arising. Had the query been addressed to Bahrain, it woula not be so easy to answer, since an. established ayatem of registration is stated to exist there, which must however be regarded as extra-legal. This may have been effective as some deterrent to interning pirates out it would have little positive effect in law beyond providing a certain quantum of evidence of exclusive use, and its value as such evidince wtiuld depend upon the procedure under wnich registration is granted. Unless the application is advertised suitably before it is granted, registration is virtually useless and indeed the system would be open to easy abuse. Also there is always the risk inherent in all extra-legalities that a legal challenge in Court may lead to more or less embarrassing situations. The Government of India would, therefore, surest, subject to any further views which you may hold, that it would be as well quiesly to allow this practice obaapx to drop. I have the honour to be.

C. for information on the subject of patent, trade mark and copyright protection in Bahrein. It was reported in 193S that registration of trade marks in Bahrein was then possible, the docu ments required being power of attorney, simply signed, and six specimens of the mark. No electro type was required. In the absence of an official classification, the Registrar was prepared to issue certificates only for goods of a similar nature, such as petroleum, benzine, gasoline, et cetera; it was not possible to include goods such as radios, cosmetics, drugs, et cetera, the issuance of a separate and independent certificate being required for these items. It was left to the Registrar's discretion as to what constituted goods of a similar type or nature. a verification and possible elaboration of the situation as above described, in the light of present laws and regulations, would be helpful, as well as a general outline of the measures which are now taken for the protection of patents and copyrights. your cooperation in this matter will be greatly appreciated.
