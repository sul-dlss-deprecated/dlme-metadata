This Document is the property of the Secretary of State for India. Question of a Loan to Persia. Note by Sir Hugh Barnes. The history of our loan negotiations with Persia is one of lost opportunities, whicli almost invariably have been regretted. Whenever the question has reached the point of decision we have lacked the courage to advance large sums of money, though we have always regarded wdth anxiety and envy the increased power and influence in Persia, which have attended the bolder policy of our Russian rivals. We have now another opportunity of granting a considerable loan to Persia and of increasing thereby the value and efficiency of our stake in the country. It is, therefore, very desirable, before rejecting the chance offered, that the pros and cons should be very carefully weighed, lest we find once more that we have made a mistake, and this time one which may prove irretrievable. As is stated in Lord Lansdowne’s Despatch of 6th January 1902, neither the British nor Indian Government has any designs upon the sovereignty of the Shah or the independence of his State. There is not the smallest n ish to use the concessions, which from time to time have been suggested as the political return for a loan, as a means to encroach upon the Shah’s territory or authority. For example, there is no desire to assume the control of the Southern Customs, or to make railways in Southern Persia, or to establish a Protectorate in Seistan. The main object of obtaining the concessions suggested has been to prevent the grant of them to another Power who would not be so scrupulous in making use of them, and who would certainly use them to our detriment. No doubt, as the Indian Government point out in their telegram of 28th December last, His Majesty’s Government, in the Despatch of January 1902, have laid down very distinctly the attitude that they would adopt if their interests in the Gulf or in Southern Persia were seriously compromised. They have, in fact, threatened to use force. But no one wishes to be compelled to put this threat into execution. Prevention is better than cure, and it is wiser to forestall the grant to Russia of political rights and advantages in Southern Persia, by monopolising them ourselves, than to allow matters to drift into a position from which w r e can only extricate ourselves at the risk of war. As regards the reasons for granting a loan to Persia, and the answers to them, which are mentioned in the Secretary of State’s telegram to the Viceroy, dated 22nd December, it may be pointed out— (i.) That the Southern Customs amount to 200,000/. a year, and are only a collateral security for the annual payment to us of 24,000/. per annum. There is, therefore, ample margin available as security for further loans, and there is nothing in the assurances given to us by Persia to prevent her from pledging the Southern Customs to another Power so long as she does not * See Sir A. Hardinge’s Keport of Jufy cede them,* or the control of them 1903, page 10. g ucll action on the p ersia wou pj be very embarrassing to us in view of Lord Lansdowne’s clear declaration of2 policy, especially if the Foreign Power were Russia, who would certainly endeavour to turn the pledge into a cession. We should have no alternative, unless we acquiesce, but to threaten war. (ii.) As already stated, there is no present desire on our part to use railway rights granted in Southern Persia. The object is to prevent these rights being granted to Russia, who certainly would use them, unless wo intervened. It is one thing to prevent the grant of a concession to another by first securing it ourselves, and quite another thing to force that other to surrender a concession after it is granted. It may be added that there is one railway line in Persia which it is anticipated would pay, viz., a line from ti e Gulf to Ispahan, and il such a line is ever constructed with foreign assistance, it obviously should be made by a British Company. (iii.) Russia has never yet failed to find money for political purposes. She is in difficulties, but she will not be in this condition for ever, or even for long. Her recuperative power is enormous, and the Grand Vizier stated in December that she is prepared to lend a million and a half on conditions. The purpose in this case,—to defeat, or to out-rival us,—is one that Russia is not likely to neglect, and the injury to us that may result is, that she may be offered concessions in which it is impossible for us to acquiesce. If we irritate and embarrass Persia by refusing financial help, the risk of the grant to Russia of dangerous concessions is a serious one. (iv.) The trade argument is not of importance, except from the point of view that all our experience in Seistan and elsewhere shows that the grant of any political advantages to Russia is invariably made use of to embarrass and injure our trade. The present position is this. Persia is indebted to us only to the extent of 300,000/. For the service of this loan the Persian Government have pledged the revenues of the Caspian fisheries, and collaterally, in the order named, the Postal and Telegraph revenue and the revenues of the Customs of Pars and the Persian Gulf. Recently, if a further loan of 150,000/. is granted, Persia has agreed (a) to accept our interpretation of the expression “ Ears and the Persian Gulf,” and (b) to promise that all railway construction in Southern Persia, including Seisfan, shall, so far as foreign assistance is required, be carried out under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government. We appear to he pledged to grant this loan, if Persia demands it, and the concessions given are well worth the price. They include the Arabistan ports among the southern customs, and forestall Russia in the matter of railway concessions in Southern Persia. The loan is well secured, and from Mr. Grant Duff’s telegram No. 164, dated 1st December, it seems probable lhat the Imperial Bank has already advanced money on the assumption that the loan has been arranged. If, however, we refuse the larger sum now asked for, Persia may reject the loan already promised, in which case we lose the concessions obtained with so much trouble, and may also find ourselves in difficulties with the Bank. Assuming, however, that the smaller loan is given and accepted, in this case the grant of the larger sum now asked for appears less formidable. The conditions agreed to will apply, of course, equally to the larger loan. The question that arises is whether, since a larger loan is asked for, larger concessions should not be required. We know that, even after providing for the service of the larger loan, there would still be a surplus, probably of 100,000/. a year, in the Southern Customs, which could be pledged elsewhere. aKCRgAlso, in the past there have been repeated reports that Russia has been clandestinely, through Native agency, trying to obtain control of the Crown Lands in Seistan, and it has also been asserted that she has tried to obtain the revenue of Seistan as security for a loan. If, under financial pressure, dther of these concessions were granted to Russia, our relations with that Power would be seriously strained. In order to forestall Russia here also, it would seem advisable to grant the loan, provided Persia agrees (i) to include the Seistan revenues among tiie collateral securities, and (ii) not to borrow on the same security from any. other Power. Poth these conditions have been suggested before. It is true that they have been rejected, but circumstances have changed. And though it would not be advisable to make these conditions a sine qud non, still it is worth while trying to get them if we can. Additional reasons for the grant of the loan are (i.) tor many years the relations between the British and Persian Govern ments have not been satisfactory. We have not come to Persia’s assistance financialiy as Russia has done. Persia has naturally felt sore, and has become distrustful and suspicious. At the same time she has fallen more and more under Russian influence, and in her desire to please Russia has been forced into even a greater show of hostility to us than she probably desires. Hence our trouble in Seistan and elsewhere ; the constant obstruc tion to our trade by the Belgian officers of the Customs department; the continual and often undignified struggle to secure fair play to our trade which is constantly going on between our officers in South-East Persia and the Persian officials; hence also the difficulties about our boundaries, and the unaccommodating spirit shown in regard to the Seistan arbitration and other matters. Greater friendliness on the part of the Persian Government would probably at once solve or lessen these difficulties, and greater friendliness is likely to follow financial assistance, and is worth paying for. On the other band, a refusal to help at this crisis will force Persia still further under the unwelcome Russian yoke, and her hostility towards and irritation with us w r ill be doubled. (ii.) We need not fear that, the relief being only temporarv, we shall be forced into further loans. If we obtain the concessions we want, we can always refuse to go further. There is little fear of Persia breaking up immediately. At any rate, she will not break up before Russia recovers. These primitive—uncivilized-nations do not perish so easily, and if we refuse it, there is little doubt that Persia can get elsewhere the help that is immediately needed. (iii.) A time may sliortly come, after Russia is more at rest, when His Majesty’s Government may wish to try and come to some understanding with that Power as regards our interests in the East. The possibility o'f such an entente has been discussed in the English and Russian press. When the time comes, the more we have in our hands to bargain with the better. The argument “ beati possidentes ” is likely to be of much force in such a contingency, for any understanding will certainly in the main be based on the status quo. Should we not therefore endeavour to obtain all the concessions we can while we have the opportunity ? Persia is hard pressed for money, the Russian terms for a loan will probably be harder than ours, and the Shah is never likely to be more ready than at present to grant what we ask.4 T (iv.) The truth is that we have now an opportunity of strengthening our position such as we have not seen for more than a generation, and it is an opportunity that may never come again. Until within the last five years British influence in Persia had been steadily waning, while that of Russia had been constantly on the increase. In the past five years, owing to the active policy adopted by the Government of India and His Majesty’s Government, our officers have held, but have only just held, their own. We have doubled the number of our Consulates, we have opened the Nushki trade route, and we have everywhere shown a firm front to Russian encroachment and intrigue. But the hope of achieving more than this seemed till lately very remote. Now, thanks to the Japanese War, Russia is for the moment discredited; her influence and prestige are weakened; her usual watchful attention is diverted elsewhere; and her material resources and ability to advance money are lessened. At no time prior to the war would Persia have come to us for so large a sum, or, if she had, would Russia have failed to check her. Now Persia sees her chance to escape in some measure from her enforced sub servience to Russia, and we have the opportunity for which we have so patiently waited. For the sake of the continuity of our policy, surely the opportunity should be seized. Otherwise all that has been effected by our recent activity, at the cost of infinite care and labour, is likely to be imperilled. Every circumstance is favourable to a successful deal. Persia is eager for help. Russia is quiescent. The Indian Government is obviously prepared to find the money. The loan would be well secured. We run practically no financial risk! In fact, we make a profit, for we borrow at 3J to lend at 4 per cent. The political risk is small, and is not to be compared with the risk which we incur if we alienate Persia still further by a refusal. In the latter case we have only Lord Lansdowne’s declarations to rely upon, and these obviously will avail us little unless they are carried into action, and we forbid the 'grant to others of the concessions which we will not acquire for ourselves. Lastly, a Liberal Government is in power, whose known aversion to aggrandisement may help to persuade the Persians to believe that we have no ulterior motives behind our demands, and that in asking for the concessions suggested, we honestly desire to protect, and will actually protect, their interests as well as our own. In short, it may be urged, with absolute truth, that of the two alternatives before us, to grant the loan is the safe course to adopt, and that to refuse it is the dangerous one. The former can onlv at the worst bring us into a financial controversy with Persia, the latter may and almost certainly will bring us sooner or later into serious collision with Russia. If this be true, those who would let the present opportunity slip, will obviously incur a very grave responsibility, and may before long find themslves in difficulties, from which it will require all their address to extricate themselves. On the other hand, if the opportunity is taken and skilfully used, not only will some measure of success crown the anxious efforts of the past five years, but it is probable that we shall be freed from anxiety as to Russian encroachment on our interests in Persia for several years to come. 8th January 1906.

For example Pe s,a has already agreed, if a further loan is given, to promise us pri^ritv n ra.hvay constructmn in Southern Persia and Seistan. If there is reason to flunk that Persia will object, it hardly seems desirable to complicate the case by add. ng canals and roads, in which immediate competition bv others , 1 k6 y ‘ , Aga '“’ ' vo d0 n,,t specific concessions, which ‘involve obligation, from Major Morton’s inquiries it seems that, except in return ior very large outlay, there is little profit to be obtained from irrigation from the Karun; levies in the Baki.tiari country would be very expensive am of doubtful utility; and to construct a road from Bunder Abbas to am would be a costly and most speculative undertaking The linking up of the telegraph between Nasratabad in Seistan and our tronder post at Rohat would no doubt be a great convenience. But its utility ,s so obvious that it must come in due course, and all the quicker if ersias friendly feelings are stimulated by a loan. There is no difficult in finding things for which we can ask. The Government of India mi-ht also have mentioned the acceptance of the Seistan Water Award the grant of land for the telegraph station at Henjam, or the payment of our outstanding claims of 20,000/. Except, perhaps, the last, none of these are saita ole for mention in connection with a loan, and all things considered it seems best, to confine ourselves to the conditions suggested in the foregoing 10th January 1906. H. S. B. Note by Sir Dennis Fitzpatrick. I do not like to detain these papers until I get hold of the earlier correspondence; hut, speaking from what is in this file and from iny recollection of the matter, I will make a few observations. I believe most of us have agreed to the advances already made, at the joint risk of the Treasury and the Indian revenues, in order to relieve Persia for a time from the necessity of having recourse to Russia, and in order to prevent Russia from getting hold of the customs of the southern ports. M bother we should, for these or other similar objects, agree to advance anything beyond the balance of the amount we have already agreed with the foreign Oflice to advance, is a question for discussion. But, whatever may he thought on it, I should be most strongly opposed to the idea of advancing money or taking any other step with a view to securing for ourselves, now or ultimately, a protectorate or any other position in respect of Southern Persia or Seistan, which we should have to defend on the spot when (if ever) the time of trouble arrived. I am, as I have always beenstrongly opposed to anything of that sort, because our military advisers have repeatedly told us that we have not the military force to defend such a position in Southern Persia, and, though some have said we might manage to do so in Seistan, they seem to have spoken with reference to Russia's present position, and without adverting to the probability that as Persia declines Russia will advance well towards the south in Khorassan, and will accordingly, before the critical time comes, or perhaps I should say before she elects to bring the crisis on, be in considerable force in that neighbourhood. I have indeed heard it suggested that it would he a good thing for us to take up some sort of position in Seistan or some other part of Persia so as to check the advance of the Russians until they were actually ready to go to war with us, and then abandon it and attack Russia in some other part of the world, hut few, I think, would approve of a course involving the abandonment of such a position after we had once taken As to the Russians establishing a naval base or a fortified position on the shores of the Gulf, I presume our navy could always prevent that. One word more. I should have thought that there would not be the least chance of Persia conceding to us any position anywhere that might lead up to anything in the way of a protectorate, unless, indeed, she was reduced to the very last extremity. Even our harping on our “ predominant interests ” in the south and in Seistan seems to irritate the Persian authorities, as it gives the impression that we are looking out for what is to fall to us when the break-up comes. This, however, is a matter for the Foreign Office and our Minister in Persia rather than for us. D. Fitzpatiiick. 30th December 1905. Further Note by Sir Dennis Fitzpatrick. 1. In the hurried note I wrote on the 30th ultimo, I confined myself to recording a protest against our advancing money or taking any other steps with a view to securing for ourselves, now or ultimately, a protectorate or any other position in respect of Southern Persia or Seistan, which we should have to defend on the spot by force of arms when (if ever) the time of trouble arrived. My object in recording that protest was to support the observation as to a protectorate made by Sir E. Grey, and on this all-important point I have now only one further remark to make. An outsider reading some of the papers before us might suppose that there was no need to discuss such a point, that no one had any desire to establish for England any position of the sort in question, but this is not so. We have, besides the proposal of certain military authorities to locate a British force in Seistan, the following :— (1.) Lord Curzon’s grand scheme for taking possession of the line of the Helmund from the neighbourhood of Candahar down to Seistan, establishing a proper system of canals, and effecting the “ regeneration ” of Scistan.(2.) Certain proposals to raise levies in tire west of Persia, which levies we should have to support with a strong force of British troops in a time of serious trouble. (3.) The proposal, in certain eventualities, to support the Sheikh of Mohamerah against the Shah. (Defence Committee, 22nd March 1905.) (4.) The proposal, by providing funds for irrigation and the improve ment of communications, to “ establish a reversionary interest 41 . . . which might be valuable in the event of a break up “of Persia.” (Ibid.) (5.) The proposal made to Russia, but declined by her, for “the partition of Persia into spheres of influence,” which in the ordinary course would be certain to develop into protectorates (Ibid.) 2. To turn now to the question which in my previous note I reserved for consideration, namely, whether, putting aside all suggestions for the establishment of a position of the sort above referred to, it might not be desirable to advance more money to Persia simply— Firstly, to relieve Persia from the necessity of having recourse to Russia for financial aid ; and, Secondly, to forestall Russia in getting hold of the Customs of the Southern ports ; and other such like advantages. I think that, save in very exceptional circumstances, we ought not to advance money to Persia for the first of these objects taken alone. It seems to me that it would be utterly vain for us to enter into competition with Russia in the financing of Persia. Russia, supposing her to recover herself and hold together, has an immense object to gain in tightening her hold on Persia. She can look forward to ultimately establishing a protec- to a , oi sor icthin^ more, over the whole or the greater part of the country; and it would pay her well to lavish money for the attainment of that object. We, on the contrary, though we can maintain our supremacy in the waters of the Gulf, must, as I have said, abandon all hope of establishing for ourselves on land any position at all similar to that to which Russia can look forward. We must be satisfied with thwarting and delaying Russia, and there is obviously a limit to the amount which it would be worth our while to advance for that purpose. It is no doubt woith wIilIl doing a good deal to check Russia s advance to Seistan, but it must be remembered she is already within 60 or 80 miles of Herat, which is infinitely worse. For these reasons it seems to me that, save iu very exceptional circumstances, we ought not to advance more money to Persia unless we can secure something of the second kind above-mentioned, that is to say, unless we can forestall Russia in obtaining some advantage like a hold on the Customs of the Southern ports. 3. Next to consider the particular advantages which Sir H. Barnes proposes we should seek to obtain in consideration of our loan. I have always been disposed, in regard to such matters, to be guided bv the Foreign Office and our Minister at Teheran who are responsible for our relations with Persia, who are more familiar with the state of things out there than any of us can pretend to be, and who share equally with us the responsibility for whatever pecuniary risk there may be in these loan S. 37. otransactions; but I will make a few observations for what they may be worth. 4. And first as regards the Customs of the Southern ports. If Sir H. Barnes is right in thinking that our bold on them would not be fully secured by the transactions of April 1903 and September 1904, and the 150,000b loan transaction which was recently under consideration, and may perhaps still be regarded as pending, and if our complete hold could be secured by advancing something more, I would not oppose a further advance. It would not (I take it) commit us to anything serious. If a considerable default occurred and we had to enforce our security, 1 presume it would simply mean putting subordinate officers into the customs houses as collectors, with a few sepoys as a guard. We would haA*e armed vessels about in the Gulf, which, if any serious trouble was apprehended anywhere, would take up a position in front of the port, and, if the worst came to the worst, the collector would jxick up his cash and his books and go on board a ship until everything was secure again. 5. The proposal to acquire exclusive rights in regard to railway con struction is not sn simple. Sir II. Barnes says that there is no present desire on our part to use railway rights grantecl in South Persia, but he speaks of the possibility of a railway being made by a British company from the Gulf to Ispahan, just as one might speak of the possibility of a railway being constructed by a British company in some civilised State (say) in South America. It must, however, be remembered that the sort of protection we should have to afford to a British company constructing and working a railway in Persia would be widely different from the protection that would be expected from us by a British company whose line lay in a civilised State. I do not suppose any British company, or the British Government itself, would dream of constructing a railw ay in Persia unless it was understood that in a time of serious trouble a military force would be available to protect it, and that is just the thing it is so important for us to avoid. If, however, it would be possible to make a “ dog-in-the-manger ” arrangement pure and simple, that is to say, that it would be well understood that, while w'e should be entitled to object to anyone else receiving a concession, we should be under no sort of obligation to mike or promote railways ourselves, and that we never mean to do anything of the kind, I think Sir H. Barnes’ proposal might well be considered. G. There remains Sir H. Barnes’ proposal to get such a charge on the land revenues of Seistan as would prevent Russia or anyone else from getting a charge on them, and it is to be observed that it differs from the similar proposal regarding the Customs of the Southern ports in this that it would probably, in the event of default, be found impossible to enforce our security by collecting the revenue, unless we were prepared to assume, to a considerable extent, the government of the country and to bring in troops to assist us in doing so. This, too, wmild be open to the objection I mentioned at starting, and I accordingly could not support Sir H. Barnes’ proposal unless it was distinctly placed on official record that it is not intended that we should exercise any right avc might have to collect revenue in Seistan ourselves. If this was not distinctly placed on record there would be the risk that, if those who might come after us some years hence were anxiousto get hold of Seistan, they would place officers supported by troops out there to collect the revenue, and say that in doing so they were only carrying out an arrangement made by us. I have only to add as regards this proposal that Persia seems, owing to causes which it is unnecessary to mention, to have come of late to conceive such a suspicion of our intentions that 1 fear there is little chance of her agreeing to it. 7. As regards the sufficiency of the security proposed I give no opinion. I am content on this as on the previous occasions to leave that and all other details in the hands of the Foreign Office, who will have the carrying out of any arrangement that may be made, and who share the risk with us. The 1 .e is, however, one point of detail which ought to be considered in this Office, and that is whether Avhatever is done is to be kept secret. The difficulty that arose on a previous occasion about showing the amount in Indian Accounts will be remembered, and the amount now proposed, being so much larger, is more likely to attract attention. D. Fitzpatrick. 9th January 1908. P.S.—I think, having regard to the complication and delicacy of the questions before us, that we ought not to set about preparing an official reply to the Foreign Office until they have seen our notes, and the matter is to seme extent thrashed out unofficially. D. F. P. Note by Sir John Edge. I am iii favour of granting the loan. It appears to me to be greatly to our advantage to prevent, if possible, the chance of Persia borrowing further at present from Russia. Hard pressed as Russia may be now for money, I conceive that Russia could easily raise the amount required on the security that Persia has to give. Further, Russia might obtain a lien on the revenues of Seistan. TV e know that Russia has been intriguing to obtain a foothold in Seistan, and if we refuse the loan ive throw Persia into the arras of Russia, and in that case Russia will be able to obtain her own terms. I would grant the loan mainly on the security of the southern customs and get rid of the still difficult question as to the meaning of “ the customs of Pars and of the Persian Gulf.” The revenues of the Caspian fisheries are to my mind worthless to us as a security. It would, I think, be useless to propose to Persia that the revenues of Seistan should be a collateral security. Persia, not without some reason having been afforded to her, suspects our intentions with regard to Seistan, but she would possibly agree, as one of the conditions for the loan, that she would give us the first option, should it become necessary for her to borrow on the security of the revenue of Seistan.10 We must not think of any occupation of Persian territory in Seistan or elsewhere on the mainland. We would be too far fro.in our base, and would only court disaster in the event of a war with Russia, a disaster which would have serious effects if we had to defend India against invasion by Russia. Our fleet could not prevent Russia, if she were in force, taking, fortifying, and holding a harbour in or near the Gulf, and a mere blockade by our fleet could not he indefinitely prolonged. I have said that it appears to me to he greatly to our advantage to prevent, if possible, the chance of Persia borrowing further at present from Russia. Time is everything to us. We could not by arms prevent Russia taking Persia, but, in the not distant future, I foresee that Germany will have interests in Persia which would he destroyed if Persia became practically a Russian province; and when the German trading interests in Persia have become developed Russia will have to deal with Germany as well as with us. In the Persian Gulf Germany could do practically nothing as against Russia without our assistance, and could do nothing as against us, but Germany could put such pressure on Russia in Europe as would prevent Russia annexing Persia.

I would not abate one jot of the onerous terms upon which the Government of India would advance a further loan to Persia, and I should U ’’ Ut ' egl ® 1 Persia ’ s refusal of the For I cannot entirely agree with Sir Hugh Barnes that “greater friendliness is likely to follow — — or t,lat “ we 'eed not fear that we shall be forced into 1, ' es ’ e loans which are not productive and are wasted upon Court x ravagance do not, I think, make for friendliness. On the contrary, we line i oniecord that a strong, popular, and priestly influence in Persia is er y hostile to foreigners, ei dona ferenles. The friendliness of the nation is not secured by them, nor are the Shah and his Ministers made bv ese means more friendly to us. Since we advanced our first loan they mve shown greater opposition to our wishes. They have rejected the . dU . a ' art ’ re use(l tele 8 ra ph concessions, raised customs difficulties, and in no single respect shown even proper regard for our rights. A creditor is rarely the friend of an embarrassed debtor. Then as to our being forced into further loans. The real fact is that we have so far lent on an infer,or security to that which we asked for and intended, and we - t ;:: n Z- A int ° fUrther loans in or&lt;Ier try and make ,oo l that security. It is a matter of ordinary experience that one mistake leads to another, and one loan to another. nor ThS u-f 1 iSSUe ’ h0wever&gt; is - whether another loan will serve our policy. H hat is our policy towards Persia? So far as I can form an opinion it is this. The exclusion of Russia from Afghanistan whettier ni the form of invasion or pacific penetration is, I think,’ But if P P • mU u m t0 War lf RuS8ia crosscs tll e Afghan borders.. Put if Russia should cross the Persian borders we should not, I think lesis by force ot arms, first because the Persians, unlike the Afghans’ cou d offer no resistance, secondly, because the field of action would e 00 ai 0 . ence our policy is not to commit ourselves to even the t meat of an immediate conflict with Russia should she invade Persia Rut bearing in mind that the Afghan western border is open on the leisian side and would be threatened by a Russian occupation of Persia we should have to be prepared for war so as to prevent the AMian border being crossed, and if Russia should invade Persian territory we should protest and encourage other nations to join us in protesting against violation of the independence of Persia. Have we already got the right to employ diplomatic weapons against Russia in defence of Persian integrity * Me have acquired the right, for we have publicly declared that we can’ consent to the establishment of no fortified places on the Gulf; we have lent money to Persia and obtained some sort of security ; we have settled differences between Persia and our ally Afghanistan, and we have established consulates and supported British companies trading in Persia This being so, and military resistance for the defence of Persia beim- bevond S. 37. D 3 *our powers, will any further loan materially assist us ? I venture to doubt it, and since Indian revenues are to make the advance I submit that we should in no case accept any less security than the Government of India desire to accept. We have already, in my opinion, made that mistake, and I would not repeat it. When Sir M. Durand first proposed a loan the idea found no favour with us. We felt that one loan would lead to another, and the money would make Persia neither stronger nor more friendly. Then a change of policy was made, and we consulted Dord Curzon, who in October 1901 offered to provide 500,000/., if an “adequate return” were secured. ( hn Mnlist* i was only too glad to get this financial weapon to assist him in dealing with Persia. Part of the loan was advanced, but the full return required by the Government of India was not then, nor has it since been* secured. The question now is whether we should largely increase our advances to improve the security which we did get. In my opinion we should certainly lend nothing to which we are not already pledged, except on the terms suggested by the Government of India, and, if we do not get those terms, we lose very little. For our present position fully justifies us in resisting Russian encroachments by diplomatic means, and in attempting to induce other European powers to take part with us in asserting the independence of Persia, and that seems all that we can aim at. We can at the same time repeat in the strongest language our determination to uphold the integrity ol Afghanistan, and if Russia does advance into Persia we must be prepared to meet that solemn obligation. If our advances to Persia were honestly applied to the improvement of its administration the case might be different, but they only add to the extravagance of the Court, and the additional financial fetters which they impose on Persia are not needed by us to justify our diplomatic resistance to Russian encroachment.

Lee-Warner. 17th January 1906.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0000fa_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/C110</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0000fa</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/C110</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Question of a Loan to Persia.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1905/1906</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-09-03T21:21:17</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (7 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at f 1, and terminates at f 7, as it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.

It is therefore debated as to whether the revenues of the Southern Ports and/or Seistan [Sīstān] could be obtained, along with a possible railway concession in Southern Persia in order to deny it to Russia.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of the Russian Empire</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Hugh Shakespear Barnes</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight John Edge</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Dennis Fitzpatrick</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight William Lee- Warner</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Seistan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Loans</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0000fa#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
