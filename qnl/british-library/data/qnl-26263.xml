[ W 5802/5802/50 ] ^ /j 0 C Confidential. Foreign Office, May 17, May 17, 1937. Foreign Air Touring by Royal Air Force Pilots. Sir, I AM informed by the Air Ministry that they have under consideration a scheme to encourage foreign touring by air among pilots of the Royal Air Force and of its reserves. The Air Ministry consider that the practical experience of air routes and air navigation, in foreign countries in which these pilots may in certain circumstances be required to operate in time of war, is of the highest value from a training point of view. This experience cannot be obtained by the pilots in their service capacity to the extent desired. On the other hand the cost of Hying in foreign countries is too high to permit more than a small percentage of pilots to obtain such experience in a civil capacity. 2. In these circumstances the Air Ministry have put forward the proposal that a subsidy of 25s. for each dying hour should he granted to pilots of the Royal Air Force and its reserves in respect of dying carried out privately by pilots in civil aircraft over foreign countries. This subsidy would not cover commercial dights. 3. I shall be glad to receive your observations on the general desirability from the political point of view of this proposal in the light of the special conditions in the country in which you reside, and of the probable attitude of the Government of that country towards requests for permission for dights of this character, where such prior permission is needed. In considering this question you will no doubt take the opportunity of ascertaining the views of the Air Attache responsible for the country in which you reside. I am, with great truth and regard, Sir, Your obedient Servant, ANTHONY EDEN His Majesty’s Representative at (030/1937) 9225 15137 —n...68*9 a (*) / Copies, for the information of His Majesty’s Representative at of Circular issued to His Majesty’s Consular Officers. ™°“ »£WErA«v, poutioal'^ano _SECR£ r DEPT.

Sir, I AM directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to inform you that, in view of the increasing number of international long-distance flights now made by R.A.F. machines, it is considered desirable that His Majesty s Superintending Consular officers shall be empowered, in cases of emergency, to advance sums not exceeding ,£100 to the officers commanding such flights. \ou are accordingly authorised to make such advances at the request of commanding officers. Should any doubt arise in connexion with an application, you should seek the instructions of the Secretary of State by telegraph. 2 . As it is possible that aeroplanes on long-distance flights may make emergency landings in districts not within convenient distance of Superintending Consular officers, but within reach of other Consular officers, Superintending Consular officers are authorised to make any necessary advances through their subordinates, on receiving a report from the latter of the circumstances which render the advance necessary. In urgent cases, such correspondence between Superintending Consular officers and their subordinates may be made^ by telegram, the cost to be charged to the Air Ministry. 3. The advance should be made from Foreign Office funds, if sufficient are in hand, and charged in account with the Foreign Office for subsequent recovery from the Air Ministry. Where sufficient Foreign Office funds are not available, a bill of exchange for the amount required should be drawn on the Air Ministry, in accordance with the general procedure for advances on other Government Departments, the receipt of the commanding officer being forwarded by you to the Air Ministry in support of the bill. 4. You should instruct all Consular officers under your superin tendence in the sense of the second paragraph of this despatch.

[ W 9094/74*27/50 ] Foreign Oi , SejJtember 2, 1931. Procedure for Visits of British Service Aircraft to Foreign Air Bases. Sir, IT has been brought to my notice that some simplification in the present methods of communication employed in connexion with visits of British Service aircraft to foreign air bases is desirable. 2. The methods at present employed are inevitably rather cumber some in that the flight of aircraft is ( 1 ) liable to postponement owing to adverse weather conditions and ( 2 ) that, once in the air, their movements are so rapid as to outstrip telegraphic and other channels of communication ; this means that the notification of a flight which has been cancelled or delayed may not reach the expected place of arrival until after the anticipated time of arrival of the aircraft themselves. 3. It has therefore been decided to adopt the following revised procedure:— ( 1 ) The original flight programme, including particulars of all foreign stations to be visited, the intended date of departure from the British base concerned, and the intended dates of arrival at each of the foreign bases to be visited, shall be communicated by the Air Ministry to the Foreign Office in accordance with present procedure in order that (if the visit is approved) formal permission from the Government concerned may be obtained through the usual diplomatic channels. ( 2 ) In the event of any minor changes of date in the flight programme, whether on account of weather conditions or other causes, the Air Ministry shall communicate direct with the British Consular authority nearest to the foreign base or bases which would be affected by the alteration, and His Majesty’s Consular representative will pass this information on to the aerodrome and any other foreign authorities concerned.(3) Minor changes of date shall be defined as covering postponements from the original date of departure of not more than 14 days from the first definite date given to the foreign Governments concerned. (4) Direct communication between the Air Ministry and the appropriate British Consular authority shall be defined as including direct communication between the officer command ing the aircraft and the British Consular anthorities. (5) The Air Ministry will also notify the Foreign Office of any of the minor postponements notified to the British Consular authorities. 4. It is especially desired, moreover, in connexion with all such visits in the future by British Service aircraft to foreign air bases, that such visits should be regarded as entirely informal, and that nothing should be expected from the senior officer commanding flights of British Service aircraft except the rendering of the customary courtesies to the actual foreign authorities at the base or aerodrome at which the British aircraft may land. 5. I request you, therefore, to communicate the aforementioned proposals concerning the revised procedure to the Government to which you are accredited and request their consent, informing me as soon as possible of their reply; you should at the same time emphasise the informal nature of all such visits by means of an additional paragraph to your official communication to the effect that, in default of special circumstances or instructions to the contrary, no formal arrangements should be made by the local authorities for the reception of such aircraft, since unforeseen circum stances may compel them to alter their actual timings as well as other details of their flights. (&gt;. Copies of this despatch are being sent to His Majesty’s Consular officers for their information and guidance. I am, with great truth and regard, Sir, Your obedient Servant, READING.[ Y 456/82/C50 ] Circular. t 15 3 i Foreign Office, June 12 , 1981. Simplification in Phrasing of Routine Telegrams dealing with International Flights by British Private Civil Aircraft. IT has been brought to my notice that some simplification in the phrasing of routine telegrams dealing with international flights by British private civil aircraft is desirable. 2. It has therefore been decided to adopt provisionally a standardised en clair formula for flight telegrams from which reference will be omitted to such items as refuelling arrangements, the private or civil character of the flight, the carriage of arms, wireless or cameras, &amp;e., except when specifically mentioned. 8 . The following provisional formula, mutatis mutandis, will therefore in future be adopted as from the 1st August, 1981, in all outward Foreign Office telegrams of this kind:— “ Mr. A. B. Smith, machine G-ABAD, de Havilland Moth, 85 h.p. Gipsy, England-Australia, Bushire, 1st April, Jask 2nd April, camera.” 4 . It is further suggested that in your reply the usual formula, e.g., “ flight and landings at authorised,” should be abbreviated simply to, e.g., “ Constantinople-Konia authorised.” Sir, I am, with great truth and regard, Sir, Your obedient Servant, ARTHUR HENDERSON.
