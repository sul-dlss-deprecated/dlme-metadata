V/ould you please refer to the corres pondence ending with my Printed Letter No* 187-5 dated the 29th February 1944 regarding a proposal by Doctor ( T Iiss) Hosman to extend her mission work in Kalba. 2. You will see from the correspondence which I now enclose that I have adopted a somewhat different attitude partly as a result of further information and partly because I feel that a flock of unsponsored and independent missionaries along this coast might prove a great embarrassment. Doctor Hosman*s own private life has been the subject of adverse comment, and the fact that her parent mission parted company with her shows that she is of a somewhat intransigent nature. \L // The India Office, London.

As e oon as the war is over with Germany, will you allow a body of new missionaries to join me in this work? I need a doctor (male) a clergyman, and 2 nurses from /jnerica. It may be the two men may be married and of course bring their wives. “ it is very important that I have accurate information from you about these permits. For some have already volunteered to undertake this medical work here on this coast. But if they will not be allowed to come then they wilJ take another position at home. If I knew Mis a Barter could be sure of. a permit when the war is over with Germany, she could possibly try to enter the missionaries* language school at Jerusalem to study Arabic. Then after the war she could be ready to work here. Thus you see it is important that I may receive from you your decision concerning all this. 1.3. I should write there will be no question about their support as our Board assures us of a comfortable salary. My o.'Xi experience is a proofof their faithfulness in sending my salary on time-eve month.. Copy of letter Bo. 558-28/3 dated 2nd April 1944 from Political Officer, irucial Coast, to Dr. Hosmon. I have been directed to inform you that there i e no objection to your practicing in Baiba as the Regent of Baiba agrees, but that it is not considered that the tines are suitable for the importation of a body of missionaries from the United States of nmerica. There would, however, be no objection to. your scheme after hostilities have been concluded and provided you were able to give suitable guarantees that the ladies and gentlemen who would be working with you had sufficient means’ to ensure that they v/ould not become destitute and a charge upon the Government of India’s revenues. p.o.

If you wish to expand your work and place it upon a wider footing the obvious course appears to be to af : iliate yourself to the Arabian Fission and to accept threir^-«dmi r:i strati on and control.5XT. 1018/45.

American Missionar y on the micial Coast. . , Dr. Miss Hosman an independent American missionary being unable to extract title deeds from the Regent of Kalba ior the house which had been placed at her disposal has aecided to return permanently to ,&gt;aham in Muscat territory. It is understood that hr. Edna Barter is coming out from the United States of America to join Dr. Miss Hosman.Mr* Harrison The papers below contain a proposal by Doctor (Miss) Hosman^en American Medical Missionary who has been frequently mentioned in Muscat Summaries, that she should practice in Kalb a,one of the Trucial Sheikhdoms on the Gulf of Qman / and should be joined there by a Missionary and a Doctor, with wives if possible, to be selected by the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions at Philadelphia, U.S.A. Dr. Harrison, the American Missionary now at Bahrein, was consulted about the project. He was in favour of the idea and gave Miss Hosmen a good write qp. Apparently she is not ijKjs^of his persuasion (there are presumably as many autheratiee ofi Presbyterians in America as there are in Scotland). Dr. Harrison expressed some doubt, however, about the standing of the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions and suggested that enquiries should be made, Ijo^establish the bona fides of this Board and its ajattiori-ty to support the Missionaries. The Sheikh of Kalba had no objection to Miss Hosman staying there ,and she was to be told that the British Political authorities also had no objection, but that they did not consider the times were suitable for the importation of more Missionaries. There would be no objection to her scheme after the war provided that the financial background was suitably guaranteed.Cppy of D.O. No. S/242-16/4 ed 17th.

Hickinbotham i Political .agent, Bahrain. Kalba Oman Coast, S.B. ^rabia, January 7.1944. Captain Tandy, The British Consul, The British Consulate, Dubai Dear Captain Tandy, I thank you, and the R.A.M. Officer for sending over the salvarsan ampoules. I thank Mr. Harrison the Chaplain for nis cheerful note when, he sunt the n stuff n over. As yet the flour has not arrived. The patient is much better but I have advised him to go in the launch to Dr. Thorn*s hospital in Kattrah where he nay or he may not get well as you know cerebal cases are so indefinite. I Kkolcl n n ^ Since I have been here Shaikh Hamad ] as asked me btb ^ f could _L.eave Saham and live here to help the people. I told him ■ I am free to do so and am willing to spend the remainder of my life helping the ^rabs of the Dubai area. I told him I will eo back to oaham until the end of pril and then move over here. I spent many years in Muscat treating the women and children but when I went on leave to U.S.xi. in April. 1939 I told H.H. the Sultan of Muscat I ./ished to live in the villages and help the ^.rabs. He told me I was vei M' welcome to use any of his land wherever I wanted to begin. So I started in Saham nearly three^ years ago. .After I have seen this place and how thte people need a doctor I have decided to accept shaikh Hamad’s invitation. But I also wish to consult you about thisand asl for your consent, and permission. dince I have known a bit of the history of Dubai territ ory since 1910, i feel this opening is the result of the splendid work ' one by tinest type of British Consuls who have worked faith- fully.in the Persian Gulf despite the hardships of the climate, malaria and Poslem resistence. T lay you younger men always live up to the high standard of such men as General dir Percy Cox, Col. Gray, Cols. Knox, Travor, dir Lionel Haworth and others. Outsiders cannot understand the great contrast between 1S11 when no white ■ 'Nerson was allowed to land in Dubai and up here and today t hese xirabs are asking for doctors to come and live among them. I informed dhaikh Hamad if you allowed me four permits or no objection certiiicates I would send them home to my Board for a nan doctor anc his wife and also for a clergyman and his wife to come and help me. But I want the clergyman to be so interested in the medical work that he will study nursing as much as he can so when he comes out here, I wish him to assist the an doctor in the operations and look after the medical supplies that they are not stolen. It may be the doctor and the clergyman are single men and will not need extra permits but I think it is best to send the four to make Stare of getting the doctor here. I have a nurse hiss Ldna Barter who is planning to join me as soon as President Roosevelt will allow women to travel out. H.H. the Sultan of Huscat gave me a permit for her three years ago but if vou .;ish to men tion her name also for this Dubai territory I shall appreciate it. The person to whom the permits are to be' sent is bi*• o. Gordon koldcroft dec. Independent Board for x-’resbyterian Foreign Fissions, 151, Maplewood nve,Philadelphia, Peon,Penn.U.d .a. iou can r est assured no missionary will be sent here who is not pro British for the men of this Board are chiefly of Scotch descent. Dr. Harold Laird is the President and Rev. £arl Lie Intire is the Treasurer. Dr. Holdcroft the Secretary has spent nearly forty years an Korea and knows 1 ow bitter has been the Japanese oppression in his Hission field. If all goes well I plan D.7. to leave here after ten &lt; ays or may be a week for Saham.- SI ... has been ever and ever so kind and courteous to me. Sincerely Yours Sd. S.^. Hosmon. Paul V/. Harrison, Bahrain, Persian Gulf, via Bombay. Dear kajor write. Hickinbotham:- Your note of January 22,is before me as I Dr. Je all general Hosmon worked know her very with well the ^rabian Mission ho Her Surgical capacity for about 25 years. is limited, out her general medical work is excellent and her spirit in ministering to all and sundry very fine. Her Hvangelistic zeal is very_great,^but her tact is unusual, and so far as I know the Krub^ Rulers under whom she has worked have esteemed her work very highly indeed. I do not believe that there has been any exception .is at any time. She is very much ^ iedy, by the. British as by the American definition of that term. Dr. hosmon left our organisation because her religious convictions, is of a very conservative tyoe more .1 as ;he most of us are somewhat .iberal, as she felt that she , m indeed, r ret not wish to remain associated with a group with whom she differ- ec. so strongly, ,/e v/ere sorry to see her go, but she left with our very best v/ishes for her independent missionary career, and those good ishes she has still. Dr. Hosmon has been trying for some Tr ears to get a group to come out and join her in her ;ork for the villages of Oman* I think that you can take without hesitation her assurance i such workers which she secures r ill be extremely loyal , to the British rule in Arabia • ./hat she says in her letter is perfectly true, Her own convictions lave always run that way.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000517.0x00000b_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/908</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x00000b</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/908</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Ext 1488/44 'Dr Hosmon: American Medical Missionary'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1944/1945</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-12-20T22:11:24</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (12 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 14; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence regarding a request by American missionary Dr Sarah Longworth Hosmon for permission to establish a medical practice in Kalba, Trucial States, and for permits for other missionaries to travel from the United States to join her.
