Much of the correspondence discusses longstanding British concerns that the boundary should be officially defined and demarcated before any valuable minerals are discovered in the area. A settlement of the boundary is initially suggested in May 1913 by the Agent to the Governor-General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan (Lieutenant-Colonel J Ramsay); the issue is raised again in May 1938, with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Sir Trenchard Craven William Fowle) making the case for the establishment of a small boundary commission for the purpose of settling the frontier dispute.The volume includes discussion of the following: the Sultan of Muscat's concerns regarding a reported Trans-Persian railway survey near Gwadur in 1912; territorial disputes between the Gwadur and Mekran authorities; trade disputes between Kalat and Muscat (also spelled as Maskat and Masqat in the earlier correspondence); whether the Burmah Oil Company and Indian Oil Concessions Limited should be permitted to negotiate with the Sultan of Muscat, in spite of the fact that the Sultan cannot grant an oil concession without the Government of India's approval; the likelihood of the Khan of Kelat being in favour of demarcation; travel arrangements and expenses for the proposed boundary commission; the alleged crossing of the Gwadur boundary by Kalat state officials; rumours of the Khan of Kalat's intentions to invade Gwadur; reported incidents between Muscat and Kalat subjects.The volume features the following principal correspondents: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Agent to the Governor-General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan; the British Agent, Gwadur; the Sultan of Muscat; the Director of the Persian Gulf Section of the Indo-European Telegraph Department; the Assistant Political Agent, Mekran; officials of the Government of India's External Affairs Department.Also included in the volume is a sketch map of Gwadur and the surrounding region. The Arabic language material mainly consists of correspondence between British representatives and the Sultan of Muscat. The file also includes a small amount of correspondence in Farsi.Whilst the volume includes material dating from 1912 to 1942, it should be noted that there is no material covering the period of 1920-1936.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Agent to the Governor-General, Resident and Chief Commissioner, Baluchistan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Assistant Political Agent, Mekran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indo-European Telegraph Department, Persian Gulf Section, Director</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kalat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Gwadur</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Trade disputes</topic></subject><subject><topic>Boundary disputes</topic></subject><subject><topic>Boundaries</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00037e#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00037e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
