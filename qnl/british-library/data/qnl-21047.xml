Now, Karachi. To, THE POLITICAL, AGENT, B__ A _ _H _ R E I Jl._ (P. Gulf) Sir, I bag to lay down the following few lines for your kind information. Your honour is fully aware that the present Custom House of Bahrein is in the possession of Sheikh Essa Bin Ali U1 Khalifa. The said Sheikh being illiterated handed over his Customs' manage ment to the Company of 8 or 9 Hindu Merchants. After elaps of some years the said Custom House solely came in the hands of Seth Gangaram Tikamdas a well known merchant of your country for manage ment . The said Gangaram Tikamdas at present is dead and his two sons one Mr. ChaturbhtlijJ &amp; second Lie. Hooljimal are residing permonantly at Karachi or Tatta (Sind). Consequently the manage ment of the said Custom House came in the hands of his partners liaharaj Thirdas Tikamdas &amp; his two younger brothers i.e. (1) Maha- raj Visoomal Tikamdas (2) Maharaj Haraindas Tikamdas. The said Thirdas Tikamdas and his two brothers were the directors of the said Customs House for about 10 years during which period they knocked down the sum of Hs. 1000000/- from the said Customs. The said Thirdas Tikamdas and his brother Vissoomal are dead and only Me. Efaraindas is alive who is residing permonantly in Karachi. Now at present the management of the said Customs House is in the hands of 6ne Narimal Tarachand, who is at present called as Director of the said rfust-CHns. When he first caijae in Bahrein he was only a Hani f est Clerk on Rs, 40/-, after the death of the above directors hs got the said chance, appointed by the said abovemen- tioned director Haharaj Naraindas, Sir, if your honour .vill see his face you will atonce consider him as a gceat tkaix thief. 'he following ways and tricks are being played by hie:-x- Tffm 'Hi Sheet ITo. 2. To. The Poll t loal Agent. B a h r e 1 n (P.G-qlf). 30 / 7/1931. 1. The Director never gives credit to the Sheik the Cuetome duty of the goods which he or hi subhordinates receive from Country Crafts (Tka„ country boats whtfbh are withoutmanifest) 3. On charcoal &amp;/or on other food sluff goods they some times on always used to receive 'ENIIAL' i.e. on 100 bag 5 bags as Customs' Duty (Instead of money they receive goods fro-m merchants) which sttiff is never given credit to the Oast cms House but on the contrary the said goods are being sold in Bazar/and the amount is misappropriated by the said Director Sx Narimal. 3. Sheikh's orders are that wine should not be imported, in his harbour, if any passenger or person would bring it will be throne into the sea', which is never done by the said Director Haximal, on the contrary it is sold in bazar and the amount of it is misappro priated by the said director. 4. The account books of the said Customs House are kept in Gu^'rati, which are never audited or checked by any person on behalf of Sheikh, whatever the director writes is correct. 5. Besides this there are many other blunders are being committed by the said Director, ?*rhich will i be written to your honour later :on. Itc. Bagwandas Hotchand. He is a manager of Import Yard Bahrein, he before joining this was a clerk in the Import Yard Saiutais Karachi# where he was committed into theft, consequently he applied for furlough of one year and has come down to your country to rob the poor Arabs and Hindu Merchants. The public is against him because he is robbing them and putting them is great difficulties. Sir, the above whole story can be proved from the account books of Customs House &amp; Merchants. In conclusion I may say that your honour will take the necessary steps into the matter^ the possession of the said are Customs may be under your control for which we xxx? thankful.

Cargo 'by rice steamers will go into the Import Yard shed. One 'bay of the new shed should 'be used for one steamer, as far as possible. This will permit of two steamers* cargoes 'being kept in the shed, 'but any cargo undelivered when the third steamer is expected should 'be removed to the I. Y. Shed. In order to make the fullest use of the new shed 'by the greatest nuinber of importers, I consider that the demurrage-free delivery period, which was increased from ten to fifteen days during the war (owing to the delay in mails), should 'be reduced to ten days. With the arrangements for paying provisional duty, and the use of the wireless for obtaining telegraphic delivery orders, and letters of guarantee, there is really no excuse to offer for giving storage free of demurrage for more than ten days after a steamer^ departure. RE cargo should, however, 'be allowed to remain in the shed for twenty days lefore removing, 'but as at present, would he subject to demurrage as other cargo is. Cargo for Bahrein not cleared within the ten days demurrage-free period will 'be removed to the I. Y. Shed and will not only incur demurrage, hut will incur extra hamali. As the removal of the cargo from the different parts of the pier to the Pier sheifll will cost less than its removal to the I.Y. , I thinltotfie Hamali charges^should 'be reduced. An all-round deduction has already 'been proposed 'by me; and when the trolley service is running, it will 'be possible to make an all-round reduction.Telegraphic address: 'eastbank.' 21.st ...March,... &lt; DIHECTQR OF CUSTOMS ACCOUNT .

Dear Sir, With reference to yoiir Memorandum of 10/6/24, and to your Office Note of 13/6/24, on the suiDject of the Monthly Financial Summary progressive increase, it appears that in previous months, receipts from all sources ?/ere included in ■the calculation. Since the Budget Estimate is for the Customs only, I will recast these figures and submit an amended statement of progressive totals in due course. 2. Hamali (Porterage) The deficiency of receipts as against expenditure is accounted for as fol»lows:- Cargo is removed immediately on the steamer^ discharge, and the expenditure incurred is paid at once. This is collected from the Importers only on their clearing the goods. During shahwal the market has 'been poor with a scarcity of money, and merchants have not cleared their goods quickly; consequently the hamali charges have not 'been collected within the current month. A part of these goods is the Steel Shed 'belonging to the Government on which porterage has 'been paid. 3. As requested, it has 'been arranged that a copy of the monthly Summary in Arabic will 'be duly lodged each month with the Shaikh's office. % • r' . 4. I am applying^to the ShaiKh's Office for payment of Rs 126/- 'being Clerks 1 travelling expenses, which will then 'be treated as a refund to Import Yard account, 5. NATUBSfs .

It was decided that the same contractor who laid the line in the Cuatono in Bushire should lay the , line here, but it was not thought practicable to comnence the work until a P.W.I), overseer fror.

Information to be supplied to H.P.M.'s Political %ent, Bahrain, by the Customs authorities of every shipment of tea and sugar to Persian ports. This information could be telegraphed to the Persian authorities who could take such action as suited them. Such action would not affect the extensive trade operating from Dubai and its neighbourhood. It is my considered opinion after careful discussion with tie Director of Customs that if the export trade y/ere abolished we should lose about Rs 50,000 per annum in Customs collections etc. This is calculated as follows from-the figures which I forwarded to you. The figures shov/ the amounts collected in duty on tea and sugar exported to Persian ports. The • figures are based upon the Import Duty which was paid upon tea and sugar which was ai terwards actually exported to Persia during the year. . Tea and sugar imported to Bahrain for local comsumption is not included. 5.v Import duty on tea. Rs. n« « •• Sugar. Rs. 35000/- Import Yard duties on abore. Rs. 8000/- Outside employment, coolies, godowns. Rs.2ooo/- Rs. 50,000/-( .2.) In addition to loss of Customs y/o should have: to incur considerable expenditure in attempting to check smuggling out of Bahrain. At present sugar and tea are 'being imported by steamer's manifested cargo. Later they are exported in native craft, mostly Persian dhows, to Persian ports. At this end the exporters are perfectly regular. They comply with all our regulations and take out shipping bills to ports of destination They make no efforts to camouflage their trade. We do not concern ourselves with what happens at the other end. if su ' :estion ilo.l. were adopted the exporters would certainly try to evade the Gistoms by smuggling their cargoes out of Bahrain. To prevent this we should have to search all out- oin.' native craft not in the harbour out out at hea. At present we have no preventitive staff, ihis is the result of previous 100licy.lt 'was considered tnat to prevent smug^.iing ly expensive and unremunative so the Government' does not make very serious efforts to check the negligible amount of smuggling that must certainly be going on. We have no customs staff at the various small coast towns. Hedd, Budeya etc etc. It would be necessary to increase the Customs staff and the services would be required of a powerful launch, such as the Lambert, armed crew, as ' ^ ' ^ t: ' engaged in smuggling are prepared to show fight. The second suggestion would also, after a little rhile, result in the exporters tryine to smuajle their goods out of Bahrain.

I agree with Mr.Belgrave's views as to the undesirahility of taking any steps in this direction for the reasons set forth by him. It would also be a distinct reversal of our present policy whereby the Ruler is being enceuraged to manage his own affairs with the minimum of interference fro;, the rolit^cal Agent. This'/h«Ji4 policy^ so opposed to the xocal interests of the Ruler,would have to be forced upon him by the 7 power of H.H's Government in the uame way as the con trol of the arms traffic was forced upon him in the past. It would have the swme effect in alienating Arab opiniion along the Arabian Coast. The Arab Sheixhs would consider that a blow strucic today at Bahrein which is the most tractable of the Sheikhdoms wouldwouXii ton *ixm®a 4it» Mr.Beigrave mentions that the control of Bahrein exports or BUgar and tea wou^d not benefit the Persian Cuatomn revenues, as it would merely divert the trade to Dtbai, I am of opinion that it is not only Behai that would benefit. Sugar and tea are imported by dhow, as well as by steamer, ana are taken direct to Bohah in v 0 atar and other nrab ports. Prom those ports, I nave lit tle doubt it is smuggled into Persia. To control Bah rein's trade while leaving the ^.rao rivals free, would be to discriminate most unfairly against the best friend the British Government has in the Persian Gulf, If it should hereafter be the policy of H.H's Government to attempt to assist Persia by controlling the Arab imports of tea and sugar I venture to recom mend most strongly that the Arab Coast snould be con sidered as a whole and that no action should be taken against Bahrein alone I have the honour to be Sir m Your most obedient servant Political Agent, Bahrein11.220/51/91.

Apart from this, however, there does not seem to be good ground for refusing to discuss thd question of smuggling from Bahrein to the Persian coast, and the Secretary of State therefore desires to ascertain whether it would be possible to give the Persian Government any satisfaction in the matter. 3.

Smuggling takes place not only from Bahrain hut from entire length of Arah coast. Any steps taken against Bahrain, if successful, would only drive trade to other ports over which we have no control, would he oppos- -ed to our present policy of considering independent status of Bahrain and of leaving Shaikh to rule for hiiiself since i it would he we who would have to see that measures, which I think would fail, were carried out. The Persian claim to Bahrain has incensed Arah feeling and the Arahs frankly state that they will fight the Persians if the latter attempted to land in Bahrain. To force measures on Bahrain hy action in excess of our treaty rights in order to placate Persian feeling would 'be to alienate Bahrain and Arah feeling towards the British. That we could, if we so desired in despite of ahove, force this upon Bahrain may or may not he poss- •i'ole. It would certainly he difficult except at some consiuerahle expense, still more difficult at Kuwait, iiiipossihle at Dehai unless we change our whole policy on the Arah coast, and we have no# means at all of pressing it on Qatar, alongside of Bahrain, except hy increasing our naval force as for arms traffic and using it for purpose. o should then hy any action at Bahrain do harm to our general policy without doing any good as far as Persia is concerned. TheThe main part of smuggling is done from Persia itself in Persian 'bottoms and not from Bahrain and would 'be largely stopped if Persia could spend the money to p;J?rol her own coasts. The real difficulty in the matter is that •d4d, the Khans are in the smuggling, Persian customs officials are 'bribed and the country of Tangistan out of Persian control. One of the chief smugglers in Bahrain, a Persian, stated openly to me that Iersia could not stop it as the smugglers were Tangistanis and Persian urahs, wild men ready to fight for a living, and the Persians were paid hirelings who were not anxious to do so.

The Persian authorities have never forwarded me a copy manifest with a request for its endorsement and return. During the War I understand that the export from Bahrein of tea and sugar was controlled; and clearance certificates were asked for; and the practice stopped in &lt;9^6 .qfe ftle® puoh OQrtlfioafew8'paaftoaUti'&gt;i^iJ!3h-T*.B.M''0 Politioal Agont./ In 1924, 1925, and 1926, the Director of Customs at Busreh was accustomed to send me for endorsement and-return a copy of native crafts' export manifests. This was done with the usual landing certificate endorsed on these copies. I remember explaining this to the Adviser, and he approved. But for over a year this practice has lapsed owing to the non-arrival of such cop|ces. Steamers' Agents landing cargo transhipped from Bunder Abbas take a Landing Certificate as a matter of routine, to confirm that the aa.rgo has been duly transhipped. From further enquiries made since my D.O, of 3rd July, I have found that the ( m uhummerah)Persian nukhudhas are not quite precise in their statements. They are not required to bring a clearance certificate^ to Bushire because they do not ply to and from Bushire, but from Pao in Iraq; and since I refused to give a clearance certificate for Iraq until I heard from you, they export under a Shipping Bill a bag of rice, and I suppose this proves to the Fao authorities that the craft has duly visited Bahrein. Cargo exported from Bahrein carries a Shipping Bill only; and we do not ask for a landing (or clearance) certificate to be endorsed thereon. But when RE cargo is re-exported through Bahrein, we ask for such certificate on the triplicate copy to prove that it has reached the mainland of Arabia, because RE cargo is only permitted to go to Arabia, and pays two per cent on that condition.No ..Ckj.Y?!

Pull duty will be charged on such goods if they remain in your island longer than the above-mentioned period ( 20 days ).

Only goods originally consigned to Hassa pay if they were originally consigned to Bahrain they must pay 5 % and can then only be aont en to Hassa if desired.The present system allows only a few particular merchants to benefit by the 2 % rule and they are also allowed to import goods in their own to Bahrain and after arrival here they often change their minds and send part or all of it Hassa and elsewhere. This means that they have an unfair advantage ever other merchants and also causes loss to Your Excellency, Anjf merchant in Bahrain can act as an agent for any merchant in Hassa, but if he wishes to avail himself of the 2 % rule, in regard to goods intend- -ed for Hassa etc., the goods must be distinctly addressed to the Haasa merchant direct and must go te Has sa.

When exporting cargo, a Shipping Bill in triplicate is taken out by the exporter. One copy is retained in the Customs for registration and statistics, one copy goes to the Pier Clerk, who supervises the loading and despatch of the export, endorses his copy and return^s it to the Customs, for checking etc.. The third copy is retained by the exporter for his own use, and he generally tears it up, as it is not required to be brought back to the Customs, but is for his own information only. I think this third copy is unnecessary, and have given instructions that it need not be taken out by the Exporter. Thus we have only two copies which never leave Customs' charge. Apart from the Statistical report your office, we are not interested in the destination of exported cargo. The system of Shipping Bills was introduced by the Special Officer, because it was suspected that much export cargo went out without paying any dues, and its real purpose is to ensure that no cargo is shipped in excess of the declared quantity. I think the system has proved its usefulness. In regard to RE-cargo, however, the exporter is required to bring back to the Customs within a month of the date of Rli—export, tnis 'triplicate copy duly endorsed by the Customs authorities at the mainland port, system would work well if (1) the Customs authority were reliable, and (2) the RE-exporter actually landed his goods,at the port of destination. Failing this he is liable to the extra three per cent of duty, making five per cent in all. I have my doubts as to the satisfactory working of this system, and am addressing the Government of Bahrein, with a view to so changing the rule that it becomes unlikely for a RE-exporter to smuggle away from the mainland the goods intended to be landed there, as I understand that the reason for the concession of three per cent on RE cargo is for goods to be consumed in the mainland.gqkfidehtial.

An attempt at chronological order has been made, with the majority of correspondence running from the earliest piece at the beginning of the volume to the last piece at the back. However, there are numerous exceptions to this rule, possibly as a result of Agency staff trying to collate correspondence by topic rather than by order of receipt or despatch.</extent><extent>Foliation: The main foliation system begins at the front cover and runs through to the last page of text in the volume. Six blank pages at the end of the file, as well as the inside back cover, are unfoliated. The foliation system is written in circled pencil in the top-right corner of the recto side of each folio. A second foliation system runs from ff 1g-28; this sequence is written in blue crayon and circled. Foliation anomalies: 1A, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1e, 1f and 1g; 93a and 93b.A number of folios have fold-outs.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume contains correspondence on a range of issues related to the running and organisation of the Bahrain customs house.
