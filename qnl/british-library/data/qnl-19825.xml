We realise, of course, that the matter will require careful handling, but perhaps recent developments in connection with oil and the Air Route might provide the necessary opening for an approach to the Sheikhs, and it is for consideration whether it might not be advisable to withhold approval to any further oil concessions (including Sharjah) until the question of jurisdiction has been settled. But before proceeding further it would be useful to have your considered views and if Che flon'ble Lt.Col.Sir T. G. W.

It may be of interest to you to know that Shaikh s. Sultan bin Saqr of Sharjah has at present a very precarious hold on his Sheikhdom. There is considerable agitation going on for the return of Shaikh Khalid, who nas previously Shaikh of Sharjah and is now Regent in Kalba, and unless Sultan bin Saqr plays his cards extremely well in the next month or two f he will probably succumb. At the present moment he is so weak that he was unable to collect a pursuit party a few days ago to go after some Awamir raiders who killed two Baluchis and kidnapped three others within four miles of the town. 2. There will of course be no occasion for us to interfere provided the safety of the British subjects and their property is assured y and I should not be apprehensive on this score if Shaikh Khalid came back. The latter is a much more desirable person and would certainly subscribe to all agreements« « I am sending a copy of this letter to Hp . lalton.

Howes, I.A., Cfficiating Political Agent, Bahrain, To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Camp Tarachi Sir 7!:V. P.lC0r.D3 I have the^nonour to refer to paragraph 2 of your letter No. 457-3, dated the 23rd July 1938, in which you direct me to submit my suggestions for a Trucial Coast Order in Council• 2. In your letter you say that the model to be followed is the latar Order in Council, and I have therefore done this. But I have condensed it very considerably, as it seems to me that the principal requirements of the proposed Order in Council are that it may be (a) easily understood by the uneducated inhabitants of the Trucial Coast (from which des cription I do not except the Shaikhs themselves, who have to signify their acceptance of it, and who may well suspect a trap in complicated sections or references to Acts which they have never seen}, and (b) not too elaborate for the undeve loped state of the Trucial Coast, though capable of amplifi cation later on. f r ou will see that such s is desired by 0ffice ' vide letter No. E.2405/1474/91 of the 6th May 1938, which forms an enclosure to your letter under reference.-2- 5/- 3. I have made no reference to the Shaikhdom of Kalba, but it could be inserted if the political situation develops so as to make its inclusion desirable. 4. As regards the various omissions (as compared with the Qatar Order in Council) which I have made, I have the following comments to offer:- (i) It seems to me to be useless to provide for deportation of undesirables (Qatar 23 ff.), as the present condition of the Trucial States would make it almost impossible to enforce such provision. (ii) It seems unreasonable to expect all persons subject to the Order to come to the office of the representative of His Majesty's Government every year to register. I have therefore in my draft left the position flexible, and provided no penalty for non-registration. (iii) I submit that it is best not to suggest the possibili ty of certain offences, such as those mentioned in ^atar 31 and 33. The former is sufficiently covered by Chapter XV of the Indian Penal Code, and the latter by departmental action or pro secution. (iv) As there is no printing and very little reading done on the Trucial Coast, I have omitted latar 32: but it could be included if you think we should legislate for the future. (v) A similar argument applies to Qatar 30. (vi) I have omitted the sections dealing with probate and administration, as also the section dealing with registration of sales (Qatar 74), as these are obviously far too cumbersome for the Trucial Coast as it is at present. (vii) Asjregards the omission of sub-section (1) of Qatar 77, I have drafted section 6 so as to leave the Shaikhs responsible for all such matters. This seems to be the best arrangement as things are at present.n -3- 5. I was uncertain whether to provide for appeal from the Joint Court to the Political Resident, but decided that Shaikhs have rather primitive methods of justice, and it may be hard for the British representative to impose any portion of our more lengthy procedure. This means that appeals can not be decided by a perusal of the record; and in fact I do not know how they could be taken, short of a retrial, which we cannot contemplate. In any case, I do not think that the principle of appeal against the Shaikh's decision in an in ternal matter, is a good one. Ve must, I submit, leave it to the British representative to see that the trial is fairly conducted. it was on the whole neither practicable nor desirable.

Date •WwM m CONFIOENriAL p Will you please refer to Peel's demi-official letter No. P.Z. 216/39 dated the 16th February 1939 in regard to the question of securing formal cession of jurisdiction from the Trucial Coast Shaikhs for the purpose of Crders- in-Council. 2. I have spent a certain amount of time in the last few months in thinking about the form which a general Crder- in-Council for the Trucial Coast might take, and I had intended to discuss the matter with you on your recent visit to Bahrain. I understood from Galloway however that you saw no particular cause to pursue this matter at the moment and I therefore let it rest. Now that the question has been raised again by the India Office I would like to submit the following views to you. 3. Obviously the question whether we approach the Shaikhs for cession of jurisdiction depends on the further question whether we have any effective object in view; or in other words whether there are to be considerable numbers of British subjects or non-Moslem foreigners imported into the Trucial Coast Shaikhdoms by P.C.L., over whom we should want to exer cise jurisdiction. So long as P.C.L. merely send in small parties of geologists for surface exploration (aided by survey from the air) it is clearly unnecessary even to consider the question. If and when the Company proceed to geophysical exploration on a large scale, however, then it is just conceivable/- The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle,-K.C.I.E., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. U S-2- ccnceivable 'that, soins object may be served by our securing jurisdiction and having an Order-in-Council. But even then uiie Order-:n-Council must be of general application throughout all the Shaikhdoms (since such exploration will not be bounded by political divisions of territory) and it must be framed with strict regard to the realities of the situation. To be brief, there is no use in our applying an Order-in-Council of 80 or 90 sections most of which we are in no position to operate. We should require merely a temporary form of Order- in-Council and the draft that I have in mind is briefer even than that submitted by Howes with his confidential letter Wo. C/545 dated the 24th August 1938. 4. It seems to me that the first essential is to discover what P.C.L. are going to do in the next year or two and — roughly — where they are going to do it. Little object will be served by obtaining cession of Jurisdiction along the Coast alone if the P.C.L. parties are themselves operating solely in the hinterland. For a Shaikh to be in a position to cede Jurisdiction to us over foreigners he must presumably possess both de Jure and de facto Jurisdiction himself; and if for instance we were concerned with a large party at work in and around Jebel Faiyah should we have served any purpose by obtaining a cession of Jurisdiction from the Shaikh of Sharjah who, whatever his de Jure claims may be or may have been, cannot exercise de facto sovereignty in that area ? Similarly who is going to cede Jurisdiction to us over the area south of Baraimi ? These, after all, are the two areas in which P.C.L. display most interest at the moment. 5. In point of fact my own view is that we need not worry about cession of Jurisdiction or Orders-in-Council until P.C.L. have finally selected their 'locations'. At that time we shall/-2&gt;[ -3- s hell have a real objective to aim at, and the Shaikh or Shaikhs concerned ought to be in the most amiable possible frame of mind to receive our approach on the question. And finally we can confine ourselves to the specific Shaikhdoms in which areas have been selected for oil development. 6. Perhaps it will not be out of place to take this oppor tunity of suggesting that P .c .L. be urged to let us have their programme for the next cold weather, in all detail possible, within the next two months.

Under present oonditlons there is no neoeseity for an Order in Council* If oil is found and oil fields are dereloped, as at Bahrain, an Order in Counoil will doubtless be required, fihort of that if the Company begin drilling seriously inrolring the establishment of camps, and the presence of large numbers of foreigners, then also an Order in Council would be adrioable. It is quite poasibiej however that as a final result of their explorations the Company may decide to do no drilling and they will not be in a position, as I understand it, to maice any decision on this point until their preliminary work is a good deal more adranced, say until after their next winters explora tion. 3. Briefly therefore the situation is not that an Order in council will be required at some future date, but that one may not be required at all, and if one is required we shall haTe ample time in which to get one out. In tnese circumstances I do no: thin^ that it is worth while spending our time, which may be wasted, in considering an Order in Council at present. / I R. T.

In case you require my comments I submit them as follows (a) I suggest that a realistic view of the situation be taken. It will be impossible to convince the Trucial Coast Shaikhs that we or they need legislation in order to deal with enemies or traitors in war. I might add that though His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain has agreed to the 'Alan, he obviously thinks it is all unnecessary. (b) The Shaikhs will therefore assume, in the absence of any appa rent necessity for-cession of jurisdiction or for war legislation, that we have some ulterior motive. I should anticipate that weeks or months of effort would be required to diminish their suspicions, and I should not be greatly surprised if some of them at least met us with a counter-demand for a permanent guarantee against possible Saudi aggression. (c) Paper documents will not ensure our war objectives on tne Trucial Coast. If the Shaikhs see th^t we possess the requisite power (or the necessary funds) we can count on all hostiles, Moslem.

(II) those ohaikhs who gave written confirmation would feel when they saw other Shaikh#not withholding that they had been tricked and would be correa- -pondingly more difficult to deal with in future VIII) we should lose in non-acceding states advantage of their vague belief in our right to demand jurisdiction over foreigners V a most valuable asset). 4« 'ilie risk of partial failure would be v/orth taking if we had object of vital importance, but i suggest consideration of the following points. 5« .ve have to consider possible appearance of hostile agents on crucial ^oast under four categor- -iess ^a) non-noslem nationals of enemy states; Vb) non-iuoslem traitorous subjects of the British Empire or allied states; (c) non-i^oalem subjects of neutral states acting for enemy and (d) Moslems of whatsoever nationality. in cases ^a), Vo) since we possess no land forces, military or civil, on irucial ^oast, we are compelled to assume ^Orders in Council or other Legislation making no difference) that we can offer sufficient inducement or be sufficiently impressive to cause Shaikhs concerned to turn over individuals to us then Under (a) the individual becomes a prisoner /of^ . rr 3. of war In our hands, and can be detained as such till hostilities cease { i find no ruling of international law preventing this).

(c) An approach to Shaikhs however for formal cession would probably destroy this impression and at iny rate in the case of some of them would result in refusal to cede jurisdiction. (d) In place of alans 1 am in favour of our pre paring for issue in case of need letters to ohaikhs informing them that in view of our ^reaties we expect their cooperation in war including the suppression of certain hostile activities in their territory. 2.

A8 stated in my letter HO .200-S, dated the 17th March 1939, under present conditions, i.e. until a large increase in tne actirities of Petroleum concessions Limited has taken place, and in time of peace, there is no practical necessity for such an order. 4* In t ime of war the situation would be that if cession of jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners is not obtained it would be impossible to apply the Defence Regulations in this area. 5. The Trucial Shaikhs at present are under the wnolesome impres sion that we have the right of jurisdiction over British subjects and {Signature) / non- {Designation) S. 44. mfp—1048 s&amp;p—(m-2042)—17-12-37—20,000.STo — 2- non-Muslim foreigners in their States, further, under Government Aa*J of India, 'Poreign Department, Notification jfo.240^ H.i?. , dated the 6th October 1381, the political Resident and his yirst Assistant (now Secretary) have criminal jurisdiction over 'native Indian subjects'^ of His Majesty on the Trucial Coast, fhe notifica tion does not apply to foreigners, European British subjects and subjects of the Indian States and we have not, so far as 1 am aware, obtained the necessary cession of jurisdiction from tiie Shaikhs of the Trucial coast. Therefore while no British Indian subject could object to our exercising criminal jurisdiction over him, a Shaikh could, if it occurred to him, which, however, I think extremely unlikely# 6 # I am S&gt;f opinion that it will be impossible to persuade the Shaikhs to cede jurisdiction over Moslem foreigners. As regards British subjects and non-Moslem foreigners Political Agent, Bahrain, after consultation with the Residency ^gent, Sharjah, is of opinion that if we approach the frucial Shaikhs for cession of jurisdiction over these classes (1) the Shaikhs will not believe our object to be solely war legislation, (2) they may demand a quid pro quo , (3) the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and Ras al Khaimah l are likely to refuse to cade the jurisdiction sought, (4) the remaining Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast, who may be expected to cede jurisdiction over British subjects and non-Uoalem foreigners, when they find that the Shaikhs mentioned in (3) above had stood out, would ■ ( feel that they themselves nad been tricked, (5) the result of any approach would probably be to destroyiI : ^ 1 -3- the present impression of our jurisdiction mentioned m paragrapii 5 above and thus leave us in a *orse position than at present. I concur. 7 # The object of obtaining jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners on the Truoial Coast is principally to deal with hoatile enemy agents in time of war. These fall under the follow- ing categories. (a) Non-Moslem nationals of enemy atates. (b) Non-Moslem traitorous subjects of the British Empire or allied States. (c) Non-Moslem subjects of Heutral States. (d) Moslems of whatsoever nationality. (a), (b) and (c) are likely to be few in number, and we could probably effect their capture through the ahaikhs concerned by the offer of rewards, unce captured (a) would become prisoners of war and could be dealt with as s uch. (b) In view of their nationality are presumably liable for their acts wherever they may be found and can be brought to Bahrain and dealt with there. (c) can be detained for a considerable time before being enabled to return to their own country. In such circumstances it may be expected that the neutral country concerned would disown the individual, or at any rate not intervene on his behalf, in which case no awkward questions would arise. (d) over this class, in view of the impossibility of obtaining it (paragraph 6 above), it is not proposed / toSs- - 4- to seek jurisdictiin. *e would Have to rely on t e ShaikHs by yeouniary inducements to deal with tnem. 8. Paragraph 2 of your telegram under reference. Even without aurrender of juriadiction it would be poaaible to aak tne analgia to prepare alana making certain activities in their State punian- able in war time. Political Agent, Bahrain, however, feela very uncertain whether the Shaikhs would understand and agree to this proposal since on the Trucial Coast, unlike at Bahrain, they are not accustomed to issue these for their own purposes. Political Agent suggeata that it would be aufficient for us to nave lettera ready for iaaue to the Shaikhs in case of need informing tnem (1) that in view of Treaties we expect their co-operation in war (2) that certain specified activities must fce preventtd or rigorously punished and (3) that if non-Moslem foreigners indulge in such activities we require them to be handed over to us. Political Agent feels that by thus showing that we have no doubt of their active co -operation we shall achieve better results t.ian by asking them to prepare alans now. I concur with these views and in order to save time am instructing Political Agent to dr^w up these letters for my appr oval* 9 # f o sum up. I of opinion that in all the circuuiotai-ces we should not seek any cession of Jurisdiction from the ahaikns of the Trucial Coast, and instead of asking them to prepare alans in advance, should ourselves prepare letters to them to ce issued in case of necessity. sd* T.G.Fowle.

We are inclined to agree with Bowie's views. In so far as ueace tine activities are concerned the problem is not urgent^ and if he feels that to ask for a specific grant of jurisdiction would merely lead to refusals in certain cases it is perhaps best not to say anything yet. 5. Even in time of war ? though the absence of - -- - jurisdiction; even over British subjects; might be a source of difficulty; we feel thrt; on the whole; if we can rely ' ' . , ■ on the Sheikhs to exercise their jurisdiction in an emergency in accordance with our advice for the purpose of dealing with undesirable activities; this might well prove in practice to be a sufficient solution; especially as it would presumably be possible to deal with British subjects who took action amounting to high treason through the British Courts in India or elsewhere - if we could get hold of them. 4. With regard to the draft letter to the Sheikh ? we notice that in paragraphs 1 and 2 the expressions '''all the subjects of your State w ; u any of your subjects' and ''your subjects 11 are employed. Strictly speaking; the reference ought to be to all persons in the Sheikh's territory; but I suppose that such a phrase has not been employed because of the undesirability of raising the question of jurisdiction over foreigners in the territory in question; and that it is thought/(J 2. thought that, in view of the very limited number of foreigners who are likely to be concerned, the provisions in '''Thirdly 1, of paragraph 2 and in paragraph 5 should suffice. I expect this is all right, 'but we thought it desirable to bring the point to your notice. 5. We therefore agree that, although, as you say, the position is not ideally satisfactory Powle's suggestions ought, in the circumstances, to be accepted and his draft letter approved.

I thereiore consider that it would not be advisable 4^ even to discuss the-matter with either of these Shaikhs at the present time. I think that it would be better to approach the Shaikhs of Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, and Umm-al-^uwain and the Regent of Kalba and obtain their consent to the exchange of letters and then with our hand considerably strengthened to approach the two doubtful quantities.

Political Agent, Bahrain, considers that no difficulty is likely to arise in the case of Sharjah Dubai Ajman Utom al ^uwain and Kalba but that Abu Dhabi and Ras al Khaimah may prore more difficult. He recommends that we should first secure letters from former group, which will strengthen our hand in approaching latter pair.

Jurisdiction in Truciel Coaet ^helkhdoma- ^ % $ In continuation of my Express Letter N6» C/209, dated the S2nd August 1945, translations are enclosed of the replies from the remaining rulers of the Trucial Coast viz* Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and Has al Khaimah. £• It is assumed that the suggestion for the preparation in London of a draft Order in Council is being pursued* tid/m A«C» Galloway Political Resident, Persian Gulf* for Secretary to the Political iiesldent, Persian Gulf* TG*I VU'a \2-r / / Ext,565^/43 &gt; CONFIDENTIAL A, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.I. ^^Tlovember, 1945* 'H i io° With reference to the correspondence resting with the Residency memorandum No.C/350 dated 25th October, we have been considering here a draft Order in Council to cover the Trucial Sheikhdoms, and I now enclose a copy of the Qatar Order in Council with suitable amendments inserted in red ink. t— 2 C The following points call for special notice - (1) The title of the Order in Council It would perhaps be better to call it the 'Trucial States Order in Council' rather than the ^Trucial Coast Order in Council' . (2) The limits of the Order (Article 2 of Pt.I of the draft Order in Council) A difficulty of course arises here in that there is no agreed geographical definition of tine limits of the Trucial States except for the coast-line and internally the boundaries claimed by some of the Sheikhs in some cases I think overlap, while in other areas the Sheikhs do not exercise effective jurisdiction over the smaller Chiefs. However, it does not seem that we can do otherwise than describe the limits of the Order as being the territories of the Trucial Sheikhs. (3) Joint Court (Definition on page 3) We presume that the Joint Court envisaged would be composed of the Political Agent and of the particular Trucial Sheikh concerned (or his representative) and not of the /Political The Hobble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C. I.E., The Residency, Bushire. Xlf* Ji'+.hf. CO -rPolitical Agent and a representative of the Trucial Sheikhs as a whole. The passage in the Order in Council has been drafted accordingly. (2+.) The application of the Order to all foreigners So far as we can see^ the only alterations from the Qatar in Council necessary are as follows:- ( a) In Pt. I 8( 1) ( a) ( ii). which as now amended in red ink corresponds with 8 l( 2) of the Bahrein Order in Gouncil, except that the word ' severally M has 'been inserted. (b) Sub-clause (ii) of the definition of 'British protected person' has been omitted in the revised draft. For the purposes of oiiris&lt;ii ction I understand that we treat the subjects of the other Sheikhdoms as British protected persons (see Powle» s D.O.letter No.ll6-S of 13th February, 1936), though in the case of QaW, not having jurisdiction over Moslems, we could not do this. ] Jo' ^ 1 (c) In the definition of 'Trucial States subject'l (page 3), the words 'or ai^y Moslem person not being a British subject' have been omitted. The effect of the retention of these words would be to reserve to the Trucial States the jurisdiction over Moslem foreigners as over their own subjects. 3. I should be glad if you would let me know whether you have any canments on the draft Order in its present fom. I am sending copies of this letter and the enclosure to Galloway at Bahrein and the Government of India.l2~ STATUTORY RULES AND ORDERS FOREIGN JURISDICTION TRuaRU VTHTicS T he Q atar /O rder in C ouncil, the Court at^ULkiiigliani ralALC, Hit ylli d^y u£ 193 j P resent, The King's Most Excellent Majesty in Council Whereas by Treaty, capitulation, grant, usage, sufferance, and other lawful means His Majesty the Kine iunsd^tjon^^^^ within the territories of the Cihetlik of Qatar ot _j Now, therefore, His Majesty, by virtue and in exerciseT^^ o*H0i of the powers in this behalf by the Foreign Jurisdiction Acts.r^^ i 8 qo and 1913, ( a ) or otherwise in His Majesty vested, is pleased, by and with the advice of His Privy Council, to order, and it is hereby ordered, as follows; P art I. —P reliminary and G eneral. — ^1. frhc Qatar OH-r ' ' ■ 1 i'- In n 1''^ raDGali.d and./ this X)rder may be cited as '' The fllilnrlQ | ['1Pt -» t£ Counci , hml r 2.

Part I 8(i)(a)(ii ). fx i The word 'severally' has not been inserted - 'generally' is presumably an error. (2) 'QAIWAIN' is I think the correct spelling and should be adhered throughout cf. preamble and amendment under the definition of Trucial Sheikhs in article 4 of Part J. 'Qaiwain' is used in Lorimer, and mostNclosely represents the first vowel of the wordV N ; &gt; _ (3) Similarly 'SHEIKHS' should be adhered to throughout cf. Article 2 of Part J. (4) Article 4 of Part I - Definition of a British Protected Person. (a) f. / P. 9 H ^ I am not clear why the expression should include a person 'other than a corporation' properly enjoying His Majesty's protection in the Trucial States. (b) Corporations properly incorporated under the law in His Majesty's dominions, etc., are included under the definition af British Subject. (c) British corporations not incorporated under the law would be excluded from our jurisdiction if the present draft stands. I think that the phrase 'other than a corporation' might be omitted. jp f ^ p Judicial Assistant - Article 4 of Part I and in Article 15. There does not in fact appear to be a post of Judicial Assistant in existance vide Residency letter No. 1061 of the 23rd May, 1931, and so substitution of the word 'a' for 'the' in the term 'the Judicial Assistant' in Part III Article 15 should, I suggest, be made. The paragraph would then conform with the definition in Part I Paragraoh 4. ,6 - I am doubtful if the definition of 'Trucial States subjects' Part I Paragraph 4 is sufficiently close to cover the floating Persian population of the Trucial States and to ?/i* 5. y 1 (F /v.8 lEUSHR^ I' /give us, L(£&gt;give us jurisdiction over them. The only satisfactory solution that occurs to me is the publication by the Trucial States of a Nationality Law on the lines of the Bahrain Nationality Law. This might take some time and so to avoid holding up the present Order in Council J think trie draft might stand and the definition be amended in due course. Sd./- A.C.

The letters of cession of jurisdiction from the Trucial Shaikhs, and the draft Trucial Coast Order in Council ^ive us jurisdiction over all persons who are not Trucial State subjects. Persians would therefore normally fall under our jurisdiction. There are, however, numbers of Persians domiciled in the Trucial Coast and it is possible that, as at Ku;,ait, the Rulers regard them as Trucial subjects. Please report if in fact this is the ca«e and, if so, whether the number involved is large. It might lead to difficulties with the Persian Government if this class were excluded from our jurisdiction. Sd. GEOFFREY PRIOR. Political Resident, Persian Gulf. Attested.

RANGE Political Agent, Bahrain, for Assistant Political A^ent Bahrain, ^ 9 1 ICopy of Residency Agent, Sharjah's Memorandum No. Nil dated the 3rd November, 1946, to the Political Agent, Bahrain. 11 H A claim for 91 cases of tea and 2 boxes of camphor was submitted to me by one Muhammed bin Abdur Rahman Zaruni, a Persian resident of Umm al Qaiwain, against Haji Baqir bin Abdul Latif, a Muscat subject. Details of the case are as follows The plaintiff claims that 91 cases of tea and two boxes of camphor were shipped for him by his brother from Goa on the sailing craft of one Salih Ibrahim Shuzai 1 . When the boat arrived at Khassab on its way to uram al Qaiwain, the agent of the defendant, one Taqi bin Abdul Hussain approached the Nakhuda and asked him to hand over the tea and camphor to him. The Nakhuda replied that he could not do so without the permission of the consignee. Thereupon Taqi produced a letter addressed to the Nakhuda said to have been written by the plaintiff instructing the Nakhuda to hand over the goods to him which was done. Taqi then brought the goods to Dubai for sale. As soon as the plaintiff heard that Taqi had taken delivery of the goods on the strength of a forged letter, he proceeded to Dubai and complained to the Ruler of Dubai who issued an injunction order on the goods and referred the matter to the Majlis for a decision. After hearing both sides the Majlis decided to postpone the case for a period of one month to enable the defendant to produce more evidence. In the second session of the Majlis which was held on the 12th August, the case was decided in favour of the plaintiff. Before the Ruler of Dubai could confirm the finding of the Majlis the defendant's agent brought a letter from Sayid Ahmad bin Ibrahim, Minister for internal Affairs, Muscat, to the Shaikh of Dubai asking that the case be referred to Muscat for hearing. The Shaikh of Dubai, for certain reasons in which he is xh interested, hesitated to Jtsncyg act against the wishes of the Muscat authorities, and showed his unwilling ness to deal with the matter any further. The plaintiff was, therefore, compelled to submit his claim to me. I entertained the claim as both sides are foreigners and gave the defendant 15 days 1 time to send a proper power of attorney to his agent. The defendant, however, after a long delay, refused to send a power of attorney to his agent and induced the Minister for internal Affairs to the Muscat Government to write again to the Shaikh of Dubai, demanding that the goods be handed over to the defendant and suggesting that the plaintiff be directed to go to Muscat and lodge his claim before the Muscat Courts if he so desired. He challenged our jurisdiction over Muscat subjects on the Trucial Coast. I have, however, disregarded this argument which is wrong and referred the matter afresh to the Majlis to which were added two new members. The Majlis examined all the documentary evidences of both sides and upheld their former finding which is to the effect that the goods in dispute have been proved to ba the property of the plaintiff (Muhammad bin Abdur Rahman Zaruni). I am in entire agreement with the finding of the Majlis and request your permission to confirm it. As the goods in dispute have since a long time been under restraint and are liable zo. deteriorate or fall in price, I shall be grateful if you will kindly pass an early decision in the matter.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Department, EXPRESS LETTER [2^. 12, Tim is an ORIGINAL MESSAGE, sent by post to save telegraphic expense and undue use of the wires, but intended to he treated, on receipt,^ with the same expedition as if it had been telegraphed.

You also expressed the opinion (cf. your letter of 27th March at pa^e 4) that a simple and brief Order was desirable. Article 1 . As Kalba is now a treaty State it could be included. Artic le 3. The draft definition does not include Corporations, which it should, nor property generally= of persons subject to the Order in Council. Perhaps the following would serve; ' The following persons and things are subject to this Order:- namely, British and British protected subjects, foreigners other than Moslems, British and foreign corporations, and all property within the limits of this Order, including ships and aircraft, of British and British protected subjects, foreigners other than Moslems, and British and foreign corporations.' /tve ^ 7 ' ' ^UutS ^ , £ f -9 SS-* VIJ ^4 Si, J? ,© iaJ^iSt,l a'O i( 3 O ob'il ik'f' k^', W jl 7 ft 2.C#'7'Vi n^r C h^h 1 (&amp;&gt; ' &gt; / */&gt;■ (&gt; if £ 1 S» 46. The assumption in paragraph 2 is incorrect. In the absence of an Order in Council for the Trucial Coast the Political Agent Bahrain has no jurisdiction there. ■* * -■ v* * • \ ^ ^ 7 s - 'C His jurisdiction is limited to Bahrain territory and territorial waters (Bahrain Order in Council Articles 2 ... X % and 8). Even if the offender is sent to Bahrain the Political Agent has no jurisdiction to try him under the Indian Penal Code as the offence does not fall within the classes described in Section 4 of the Code. Had it done so Bethel could have been tried in Karachi. D.F.A. . _ .J- £ r?*- * » 25.7.46. iiwJ \d. N* * |7-W /C/ (2) (3) ^ (4) QAIWAIN, spelling of SHEIKHS, spelling of 'Other than a corporation' (6) 'Judicial Ass« Istant' (6) 'Truclal States subjects' May recommend this? Ditto The Foreign Office suggested the Insertion of these words In the drafting of the Qatar Order In Council vide para 3 (Vol F. 93 p. 66) P.A^ statement In para 2 (4)(c) of S. 63 Is mislead ing. A corporation Is an artificial person created by the law and If It Is not so created or Incorporated It does not exist. We need not therefore take up the point with the India Office. I do not think the substit ution suggested by P.A. makes any real difference. The 'Judicial Assistant' does not exist. If he ever has to function he will have to be appointed and then 'the' is more appropriate than 'a' in Article 16. The only time a Judicial Assistant has functioned in the last 26 years is when Captain Hormer, as Judicial Assistant tried some Bahrain policemen for assaulting the Political Agent, Major Daly, who could not try the case himself. If we wish to bring the Judicial Assistant Into existence with the Order in Council, we might suggest substituting the words 'the Secretary to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf' for the last line of the definition of 'Judicial Assistant' in Article 4, but I doubt if it is worth it as the appoint ment can be brought into existence at any time by a gazette notification. The definition of'Polltlcal Agent' in Article 4 Includes a Political Agent who may subsequently be appointed to reside on the Truclal Coast#! The definition in Article 4 would not cover Persians, who are foreigners. In case of dispute* under Article 8(2) the Resident 1 s Certificate is conclusive. The Truclal Coast is scarcely ripe for the promulgation of a Nat ionality Law, and the matter need not be referred to the India Office? P V 3 /I? P. II* If you concur with the above draft d.o. to India 62 Office will be submitted. . - a / ' i ^•&gt;' 1 X* ■ My only comments are:- (i) 3e. para 51(4) of U.S's note and references. /hen the subjects of the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait (cf. 3.4(ii)), whether we treat them as 'British protected persons' or 'foreigners', are to be excluded from the jurisdiction oi thxe Trucial States there seems no teason why corporations incorporated or registered in Bahrain or Kuwait should be placed under tnat jurisdiction. I would therefore recommend the exclusion of the words 'other, taan a corporation' from ttie definition of 'British protected person' and of 'Baiirain, Kuwait * or ^atar' from S.67 . (ii) Re. 3.15(1) - 'the Political Agent snail be deemed to be the District Magistrate ana Sessions Judge'. in trying Lt. Car. Vebster R.I.H.H. in BaVirain 1 was faced with the alternatives of (1) staging a full sessions trial - with assessors, committal by a lower oourt-eto. - a terrific business for a motor car offence [2) trying the case as Listrict 'Magis 4 rat-j. I chose the latter course. The difficulty occurred when Webster wanted to appeal and in law his appeal to the Sessions Court and to nowhere else. This was avoided in tnis particular case, I believe, when Colonel Galioway heard the appeal from my decision and heard it as Sessions Judge. It would be more satisfactory if in such cases another Political Agent could hear the appeal; though my own view was that under the existing law it lay to the Political Resident as High Co.jrt since the Political Agent could clearly not hear an appeal against his own order, if such oases became frequent it would be necessary to make some permanent rule and not to oe content /■with..14/240 with a merely 'ad hoc' disposal of each as it came up. I doubt whether any action is required here. (iii) 'Trucial States subjects' are to be all one 'nationality'. If a Dubai man commits murder in Sharjah (of a Sharjah subject) then he will be subject to the Shaikh of Sharjan's jurisdiction. There may be some modifications of 9 4t»V th is^pract i ce but again I do not think any action is needed. P.R. tpa / 7 ' * / {/z. /S-3 PIL Hh-/a/ztft-v x j-Og' v fti. J /2, 1 see from .File 58/6 I below that the Joreigi Office were under the impression that the Q,atar and Kuwait Orders-in-Council were an improvement on the Bahrain Order- in-Council. From the political point of view, I sun afraid I cannot agree, and it is unfortunate that the Q,atar Order- in-Council was modelled on Kuwait and not on Bahrain. The same drawbacks appear to be inherited by the Trucial Coast Order-in-Council and the first point I should li^e to clear up is the question of jurisdiction over Persians on the Trucial Coast. By the Order-in-Council we have jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners and the definition of the latter includes any person who is not a Britisn subject or a subject of a Trucial State so that betwoen the two we have jurisdiction over all persons who are not subjects of Trucial States. I am not clear, however, whether Persians have been describing themselves as subjects of the Trucial States or not. There are, for example, many Persians domiciled in Kuwait whom the Shaikh would certainly regard as Kuwait subjects, and we do not want to find that most of the Persians on the Trucial Coast have escaped our net as this might lead to difficulties with Iran« n S I 13/5/46. ft.'*/ $ ? 4 r /— • (is) fL fa- C/xX-^f K.L. Kt . d/3 &lt;3o S'. 4^. ty/lk ^ii From this it would appear that a large number of persons of Persian origin on the Trucial Coast rouH fo under the jurisdiction of the Sheikh and not-under our jurisdiction. In practice however, this is not likely to lead to any .difficulties as we can always bring pressure on the sWikhs (a) not to shield them when they deserve punishment for what would be offences under the Order in Council and (b) not to oppress them and thereby evoke protests by the Persian Government, who regard them' as Persian subjects. Their position is on all ^ours '/ith that of the Bahranah at Khorramshahr ^ ■ 7.6.46 \ caa ^ c- j Uv-— » C L Uacl-J. wwVT ^ ^ c A/ 0 4^&lt;r cv &lt; -^yvAr t 'A? \VJc | C^vtJL uXfcv- fc-U \^&lt;Jbu — 4.. sU*LjU- 77</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000106_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/289</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000106</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/289</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'14/240 I B. 69.
