Book C'op'i Persian Coasting Trade. (Communicated by the Boai'd of Trade.) (Reference: P.G., 2nd Minutes, Conclusion (1).) PRIOR to the recent negotiations with Persia, which resulted in the signature of the other. This arrangement went further than any existing Treaty between this country and any other foreign Power, in that it applied in full to the coasting trade as well as to the foreign trade. It had, incidentally, the effect of conferring upon Persian vessels an absolute right to engage in the coasting trade in this country, and vice versa, and was the or 1 surviving case in which such an absolute Treaty right and obligation existed. I e general practice which has been tollowed in our other Commercial Treaties has been to exclude the coasting trade from the scope of the clauses providing for national treatment of ships, but to grant, and to require, most-favoured-nation treatment in respect of the coasting trade. Accordingly, the result of the Anglo-Persian Agreement, when taken in conjunction with all the other most-favoured-nation Treaties and arrangements, is that not only Persian ships, but ships of other Powers with which we have treaties in force, have an absolute right to partake in the coasting trade of the United Kingdom, even though, as is often the case, they themselves reserve their own coasting trade to national ships. Although we may not have any intention of closing the coasting trade in this country to any foreign vessels at the present time, it is obviously desirable that the obligation to allow all foreign vessels to participate therein should be got rid of. as it is clearly unreasonable that we should remain thus bound by treaty in a world in which so large a number of the principal maritime Powers exclude British ships from this trade. On the other hand, in Persia itself our ships have enjoyed this facility, and whatever it may be worth it seems desirable to hold on to it if possible. Taking, therefore, both of these considerations into account, an effort w r as made during the recent negotiations with Persia which led to the conclusion of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty to induce the Persian Government to accept a Protocol to the Treaty to the effect that existing Treaties should not be held to confer on the vessels of either party the right to participate in the coasting trade of the other, but that British ships w r ere to continue to be allowed to engage in the Persian coasting trade so long as Persian vessels w 7 ere allowed in the coasting trade of the United Kingdom. The Persians appear not to have understood this proposal, or, at any rate, to have disliked it, and time being short it was dropped in favour of the maintenance of the status quo which w T as effected in an exchange of Notes. The present position, therefore, pending the conclusion of a new Commercial Treaty, remains the same as it has been for many years past. Although the solution suggested by His Majesty's Government is no doubt the best from the point of view of British interests, for it gets rid of a Treaty anomaly whilst maintaining our rights in Persia until such time at least as we decide to close our own coasting trade, it is perhaps not altogether surprising that it did not appeal to the Persian mind, as it is not based on any real reciprocity, even in form, and the open coasting trade of the United Kingdom is of no practical value whatever to Persia. As will be seen from the annexed Note on the extent of our shipping interests in Persia, the coasting trade of Persia is of no very great importance to us, and although w 7 e might in the forthcoming negotiations for a new Treaty of Commerce and Navigation put forward a proposal similar to that made in connection with the Tariff Autonomy negotiations, namely, that British vessels should be permitted to engage in the Persian coasting trade so long as Persian vessels are permitted to engage in the coasting trade in this country, it would not involve any great sacrifice if this clause had to be dropped and w 7 e were left in the same position as we are in the case of most countries wdth which we have Commercial Treaties. We shall, therefore, no doubt, in these negotiations do well to be satisfied w ith the navigation clauses which are contained in our usual Treaties, including one which will have the effect of excepting the coasting trade from the operation of the clauses providing for national treatment of ships whilst securing most-favoured-nation rights. There is in any of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty of the 10th May last, the Treaty rights of British ships in Persia were those conferred by Article 4 of the Anglo-Persian Agreement of 1920, which provided, in effect, for most-favoured-nation and national treatment in all matters relating to Navigation for the ships of either party in the territoriescase no ^reat likelihood of Persia seeking to close her coasting trade to British ships in the near future, as certain other Powers have done, as there is reason to think hat she recognises the advantages of the services in this matter performed by British shipping, and so long as our ships have equal rights with those of any other foreign nationality the existing position is likely to be maintained, Persian shipping being inadequate for the purpose. u'u - i -?• It should perhaps be observed that the coasting trade, which is spoken of in this memorandum is the coasting trade in the strict sense, that is to say (in the case of Persia) the carriage from one Persian port to another of Persian goods or Persian passengers It does not, of course, include the voyages from one Persian port to another of ships engaged in the foreign trade for the purpose of landing at a succession of such ports persons or cargoes brought from abroad, or taking up at a succession of such ports persons or cargoes bound for a foreign destination. It is of great importance to British shipping that the right to continue trade of this description should be maintained, and provisions to this effect are always included in our Treaties. Board of Trade, 5. IP. 1, August 20, 1928. Annex. Share of British Shipping in the Persian Coasting Trade. The bulk of the overseas trade of Persia is carried in British ships, as is shown by the following figures, taken from the Persian Official Report for the year 1925-26, the latest period for which statistics are available. These figures show the nett tonnage of ships cleared outwards from Persian ports, and the quantity of cargo exported in these ships :— Fla&lt;r. British Persian German Other (Thousands of tons.) Xett tonnage. Cargo exported. 8.981 4,549 182 35 133 7 58 9 Total 9.354 4,600 is, therefore, probable that a large proportion of the coastwise traffic betweei ersian ports is m practice carried in British ships. From the information available i seems cei am that the total volume of this traffic is quite small, compared witl fiimro 0 me k 0 traffic between Persia and other countries, but exac figures are not available. cnastTmr t 0 r^!L^ n fE W ^ C ^- C u n T^j- re ?^ r&lt; ^ e ^ a ? ^ av ^ n g a regular service in the Persiai arif j iv.fLpU- /%v, e TadlaLme , w hich runs two weekly services from Bomba^ onlv^t B^ht v v, erSlan T' 11 J 0 ^ e of the?e &gt; th « “ fast mail ’ service, touche service 1 and Basra ' but the . otb er, the “ subsidiary mail ' side of the milf fn iVp 11 tlf ( the Persian Gulf, zigzagging from om Abbas Linmih Bn«hir» 0 aTv. le gajonty of these ports, Charbar, Jask.
