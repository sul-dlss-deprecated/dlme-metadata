SOME five years ago a Minister of the Crown declared in Parliament that the ascendency of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf ”—which he pronounced to be the foundation of British policy —“ was not merely a question of theory, it was a statement of fact.” Exception has not infrequently been taken to the position of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf upon the ground that, without a shadow of right, she has constituted herself the general arbiter and guardian of that part of the world. As such a description of our status—which appears to represent a view widely prevalent abroad—may not improbably be adopted by foreign Powers when increasing interest leads them to assume a definite attitude on this ques tion, it appears desirable to collect, in a form convenient for reference, the salient facts of our historic association with the Gulf, and to sum marize the views expressed by the Government of India and by successive Governments at home, —views which are remarkable for unanimity, and which have now well-nigh acquired the sanction of an axiom in the direction of British policy. It is with this purpose that the present Memorandum, which is merely a compilation of leading and largely verbatim extracts from authoritative* sources, has been drawn up. The de jure position in the Persian Gulf is that of a sea open to the flag of all nations, the northern shores and territorial waters of which are included in the dominions of Persia, while its western and southern coasts are partially owned and partially claimed by Turkey, or are in the occupation of Arab tribes, w ho have entered into Treaty relationships of varying character, con stituting a sort of veiled Protectorate, with Great Britain. The islands in the Gulf are owmed either by Persia or by Arab Chiefs (in the case of Bahrein under British protection) ; but upon one of the Persian islands, viz., Kishm, Great Britain possesses a piece of land by virtue of an original grant from the Imam of Muscat, to whom the island once belonged. Outside the * Two works, which would have been invaluable for reference, have not been available in the preparation of this Memorandum, viz.: “ The Official Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf,” by Mr. Lorimer, and a “ Trade Report on Mesopotamia,” by Mr. Lloyd.

To the south of the entrance to the Persian Gulf, but within the sphere of its political influence, the Arab State of Muscat has for years been predominantly controlled by British influence; its trade is similarly in Anglo- Indian hands ; and its Ruler has not merely for years been subsidized by the Government of India, but in 1891 entered into an Agreement with the British Government not to alienate any portion of his dominions to any other Power. The cle facto position upon the waters and on the shores of the Persian Gulf reflects a more positive British predominance than the preceding paragraph might indicate. In the early years of the nineteenth century the Slave Trade was rampant in the Gulf, and the vessels of the Indian Marine were engaged in a long and arduous struggle with the Arab pirates who infested its southern coasts. This conflict, which was conducted entirely by British agency and means, without any help from the Persian Government, resulted in the establishment of Treaty relations with the great majority of the Arab Chiefs, under which they hound themselves to observe perpetual peace and to refer all disputes to the British Resident at Bushire. The pax Britannic a, which has ever since, with rare exceptions, been maintained, is the issue of these arrangements and is the exclusive work of this country. Of similar origin wen; the soundings of the channels and the surveys of the shores of the Persian Gulf, which the navigators of all nations owe to the labours of a long line of naval officers ot the Indian service. During the nine teenth century British trade acquired almost a monopoly of the foreign commerce of the Gulf ports. Indian Bunias from Shikarpur and other parts of Scind have settled in considerable numbers at Lingah, Bunder Abbas, Bushire, and4 Bahrein. Before the advent of the Belgian Customs officials at the former ports, and to this day at Bahrein, they have farmed the Customs. Foreign imports and exports for the most part are conveyed to and from the Gulf in British ships, more than one Anglo-Indian Company (the “ British India,” the “ Bombay and Persia,” and the “ Anglo-Arabian and Persian Gulf ”) having maintained for years a merchant-steamer service between Karachi and Bussorah, touching at the Gulf ports on the way, whilst the rival ventures that have occasionally been attempted by foreign nations have uniformly failed and been withdrawn, with the recent exceptions ot the heavily-subsidized vessels of the Hamburg- American line, and of the Russian Steam-ship Company, which maintains quarterly sailings from Odessa. Before the institution of the Annual Series, No 3858 German service the statistics show that 93 per j u i‘ v 19 o 7 &gt; cent, of the numbers and tonnage of the steamers engaged was under the British flag. The protection of the pearl fisheries, which are carried on by the Arab tribes under the time-honoured conditions, is an important feature of British policy. This subject is referred to in a subsequent portion of this Memorandum, deal ing with matters of commerce. During the last forty years the maintenance of Government of the submarine cables of the Indo-European Tele- 1,lclla, vlde su P ra - graph Company from Fao to Jask, and of the land lines from that place to Karachi, has also devolved upon the Indian Government, and has tended to increase an already preponderant in fluence over both the waters and the shores of the Gulf. Latterly there has been a deliberate but neces sary consolidation of our influence in certain quarters where trouble threatened or where rivalry was feared. At the north-west extremity of the Gulf the Government of India, under instructions from His Majesty’s Government, have entered into engagements, dated 1899 and 1907, with the Sheikh of Koweit, by which he has bound himself and his successors not to receife the Representative of any otter Power and not to alienate any portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other Power, while, on the other hand, he has granted to His Majesty’s Government certain prior rights in regard to the leasing of any portion of the foreshore of his territory. The first of these Agreements was dictated bythe increasing encroachment of Turkish authority . the latter was due to a determination on the part of His Majesty’s Government to promote the participation of Great Britain in the Bagdad Railway upon favourable terms. At Bahrein a step was taken in the direction of protecting British interests and those of the local Sheikh by the appointment of a regular Political Agent, whose beneficent influence has already begun to make itself felt, notably in the settlement of judicial disputes. The more effective application of this, influence is now under consideration, with a view to meeting the increasing requirements of European inter course; while the reform of the Customs adminis tration, and the proper control of the resulting revenue, has continuecl to occupy for some time the attention of the Government of India, overument of Such, briefly summarized, is the position that India, vide supra. has been won by Great Britain, not without the expenditure of many millions of money and the sacrifice of many valuable lives, in the Persian Gulf. In its vindication this country has more than once been called upon to enter into military occupation of ports or islands in the Gulf. The Island of Kharak was occupied by Indian forces from 1838-42, and again in 1856-7. Bushire was held during the latter years, as also were Mohammerah and Ahwaz upon the Karun. The occupation of these places was an illustration of the vigour with which, in past years, our ascendency has been maintained. Their abandon ment was a proof of the reluctance which has invariably been displayed to emphasize or to perpetuate those responsibilities. Mr.T.J. Bennett’s The situation of Great Britain in the Persian Paper (see list). Gulf j ias ! 3 een we ll described as unique; for although, with the slight exceptions referred to, she has at no time enjoyed, or even asked for, territorial acquisitions in those regions, she has for generations borne burdens there which no other nation has ever undertaken anywhere, except in the capacity of sovereign; she has had duty thrust upon her without dominion; she has kept the peace amongst people who are not her subjects; has patrolled, during upwards of two centuries, waters over which she has enjoyed no formal lordship; has kept, in strange ports, an open door through which the traders of every nation [1098] c6 might have as free access to distant markets as her own. If Great Britain has become, in any sense, the arbiter and guardian of the Gulf, it has not been through a restless ambition urging her on to the control of the waste places of the earth, but in obedience to the calls that have been made upon her in the past to enforce peace between warring tribes, to give a free course to trade, to hold back the arm of the marauder and the oppressor, to stand between the slave-dealer and his victim. Part II.—POLITICAL. NOTE. — The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and Consul-General at Bushire. This official qua Political Resident is under the Indian Government; qua Consul-General under the Foreign Office. The cost of his establishment is divided between the British and Indian exchequers. As a Consular officer, the Political Resident receives His Majesty's commission as Consul-General for the Provinces of Fars, Khuzistan, and Luristan, and the district of Lingah, and for the coasts and islands of the Persian Gulf, being within the dominions of Persia. He resides at Bushire, and receives an office allowance of 120/. from Foreign Office funds. The judicial powers and jurisdiction of the Political Resident are exercised, by virtue of his commission as Consul-General, under the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council. The Resident exercises an undefined but considerable influence upon the political affairs, more especially external, of Muscat, the Trucial States, Bahrein, and Koweit, at which places the Representatives of the Indian Government are under him. (a.) Muscat, including the Musandim Peninsula. At Muscat there is a Political Agent appointed by the Government of India, who also holds a commission as Consul, under the Foreign Office. The cost of the establishment is borne by Indian revenues. Neither the coast-line nor the hinterland of the dominions of the Sultan of Muscat has ever been delimitated or accurately ascertained. In the British Counter-Case, presented to The Hague Tribunal in the Muscat Dhows Arbitra- /7 tion in 1905/it is stated that the southern limit on the coast-line of Arabia reached by the Sultan’s dominions is near Bus Sair or Sajir. At Bakhiout (17° 15' south by 53° 25'east), a place near this point, the Sultan’s Yali has built a fort. From Bakhiout up to the town of Muscat, the coast-line is continuously and admittedly under the sovereignty of the Sultan of Muscat. North and west of the town of Muscat the coast-line ia under the undoubted dominion of the Sultan as far as Khor Kalba. The Sheikh of Shargah claims authority over the coast-line north of this point as far as Bas Dibba, as being part of the territories of the Jowasmi tribe. For many years this district—wh'^h is known as the Batineh coast—has been regarded as feudatory of the Sheikh of Shargah, and the coast itself as subject to the Maritime Truce which will be mentioned hereafter. This territory has never been under the sovereignty of the Sultan of Muscat, and it is admitted in the French Case in the Muscat Dhows Arbitration that it [is under the govern ment of the Sheikh of the Jowasmi, residing at Bas-el-Kheimah. The following passage, which constitutes an important admission on the part of His Majesty’s Government, is a verbatim extract from the British Counter-Case above referred to :— 44 From Bas Dibha to Tibba (Tibat) the coast forming the promontory of Musandim is claimed the Sultan of Muscat, who has certainly before and since 1864 exercised authority on that coast by his Yali and in other ways; and his rights on the coast are recognized by the Sheikh of Shargah and the Jowasmi.” A detailed account of the territory in question, which comprises Elphinstone Inlet and the Maklab Isthmus, is contained in a letter from the Political Agent at Muscat, dated the 2nd July, 1902. A Minute by Lord Curzon, dated the 6th October, 1902, also deals with the question. Major Cox expressed the view that the Sultan’s jurisdiction was of so uncertain and ineffective a character that it would he open to His Majesty’s Government either to recognize or to ignore its existence, as might be found most Mr. Lorimer, convenient; but Mr. Lorimer, who made investi- March 25, 1905. g a ti 0 ns on the spot, controverted this view. The passage quoted finally disposes of all future ambiguity as to territorial jurisdiction. [1098] G *8 : The predecessors of the present Sultan occupied ^ernment of territory for a good many years on the Persian despatch of eoast from Bunder Abbas to Lingah with the 18 ' Island of Kishm, under a Eirman of the Shah of Mr Murray, Persia, to whom they paid rates or tribute, Nal2, January 16, In 1855 a lease for twenty years was granted Mr. Alison, No. 49, 'at an annual rent. In 1868 a new arrangement ^P r d 7; No. 108, July 29 ; No. 106, was made for seven years, also at a rent, but, on August 4,1868. the occasion of civil war in Muscat in 1868, the Mr. Thomson, Shah cancelled the lease, under powers given by Septembers; the Convention, and resumed occupation of the N 0 . 70 , October 19; .No. by, territory in question. November 26, Gwadur is an enclave on the confines of Persia and Beluchistan, which has for over 100 years formed part of the dominions of the Sultan of Muscat, to whom it was granted by the Khan of Khelat. It extends for a radius of one stage (about 10 or 15 miles from the town of Gwadur). In this territory is a station of the Indo-European telegraph, but it has never been occupied by .Great Britain. - The British connection with Muscat is of long Government of standing. Treaties of Eriendship and Commerce, Jespat^h!^ as well as for the suppression of slavery, have supra. -been concluded with successive Imams of Muscat ;on different occasions since 1798. In that year . the first engagement wns entered into between the East India Company and Saiyid Sultan for the exclusion from his territories of Erench influence, which contemplated finding in Muscat a convenient basis of attack upon India in the war then being waged between Great Britain and Erance. At a later date, on the death of Saiyid Said in 1856, a dispute arose between his two sons as to the possession of Muscat and Zanzibar, which had hitherto been united under the same Buler. This w r as referred to the arbitration of the Viceroy of India, then Lord Canning, who, after careful - inquiry, decided that the two States should remain separate, being divided between the two brothers, but that Zanzibar, in virtue of its superior wealth, should pay to Muscat a yearly subsidy of 40,000 crowns (5,760/.). At a subse quent period, in 1873, the British Government, in return for Agreements concerning the suppres sion of the Slave Trade, successfully concluded with the Rulers both of Muscat and Zanzibar, undertook to relieve the latter of this payment, which has since that date been made by the v9 Government of India almost without intermission* to the reigning Sultan of Muscat. The Sultan was to receive this subsidy “ so long as he con tinued faithfully to fulfil his Treaty engagements, and manifest his friendship towards the British Government/’ It appears, indeed, that since the time of Saiyid Said no Sultan of Muscat has been able effectively to establish his position without obtaining the recognition of the British Govern ment. Throughout this period the Government of India have on several occasions been called upon to intervene in the dynastic disputes of the Muscat State. Claimants or pretenders have been interned in India, have been prevented from attacking a reigning Sultan, have been given allowances, and have been otherwise treated with marks of wise and beneficent interest. Thus, in 1874, in 1877, 1883, 1886, 1888, 1890, and again in 1895 and 1896, His Majesty’s Government afforded the Sultan valuable and effective support in the maintenance of stable government. This catalogue of services rendered by the British Government to successive Rulers of Muscat, and notably to the present occupant of the throne, the annual payment of a subsidy contingent upon the loyal fulfilment of Treaty obligations, and the history of the influence thereby exercised by Great Britain for a period of over half a century upon the fortunes of the State, at once explain and justify the existence of a positive political predominance on the part of Great Britain, that is shared by no other Bower in the affairs of Muscat. While not com promising the independence of its Sovereign ,wdiich both the British and French Governments have reciprocally bound themselves, by a declaration made in the year 1862, to respect, this condition of affairs has yet been the inevitable outcome of the physical situation of the country, of its contiguity to the shores of India, and of its close proximity to the waters of the Persian Gulf, in which British interests, political and commercial, have exercised so commanding an influence. * (1.) There was an intermission in 1888-90, consequent on the death of Sultan Seyyid Turki, and pending the complete recognition of his successor. (2.) There was a very short intermission from December 1898 to September 1899, pending the settlement of unpaid balances of indemnity (arising out of losses to British subjects during Abdullah-bin-Saleh’s rebellion) and of two loans. (British Counter-Case, Section VIII.) [1098] D10 In the ports and territory of Muscat itself this predominance has been accentuated by the facts that the trade of the British dominions with Muscat amounts to about five-sixths of the entire trade of the country ; that the latter is almost exclusively in the hands of Indian traders, who are British subjects; that the commerce and interests of any other country are relatively insignificant; that the share of the trade enjoyed by the three other Powers with whom Muscat * has direct Treaty relations, viz , America, Prance, and Holland,* amounts, if added together, to less than one-seventeenth of the entire trade of the country. The relations of amity which have been above recorded culminated in 1891 in an Agreement voluntarily entered into by Seyyid Feysal-bin- Turki, G.C.I.E., the present Sultan, following immediately upon the conclusion of a new Commercial Treaty between Great Britain and Muscat, by which he undertook never to cede, to sell, to mortgage, or otherwise give for occu pation, save to the British Government, the dominions of Muscat and Oman or anv of their dependencies. In 1894 a French Vice-Consul was appointed at Muscat, and this official made it his first aim to alienate the sympathy of the Sultan from Great Britain. The action of France was believed to be inspired to a large extent by Bussia, who was credited with designs of an aggressive naval policy in the Gulf. It would be tedious to retail the circumstances under which this action was exerted. Suffice it to say that matters reached a crisis in 1899, when it transpired that an Agree ment had been concluded with the French Government, in March of the preceding year, for the lease of a coaling station at Bunder Gisseh,a place 5 miles south-east of Muscat. This action was held to constitute a violation of the Agreement of 1891 with Great Britain. Owing to this and the breach of other Treaty stipulations, and of personal assurances formally entered into by the Sultan, a Memorandum was presented to him on the 3rd February, 1899, by the Government of India, which, after rc- * The dates of the respective Treaties are: United States of America, 1833; France, 1844; Netherlands, 1877. An Arrangement respecting trade jurisdiction, wrecks, &amp;c., was concluded by the Portuguese Governor-General of Mozambique in February 182C.L9 Imperial Defence, and their decision was con veyed to the Government of India in a despatch dated the 19th May, 1903. It was to the effect that the hoisting of flags was open to the objection that it would not confer upon this country any special rights in the places selected, unless it were accompanied by a specific pro clamation of protectorate or annexation. On the other hand, an open assertion of British claims to these places might excite the jealousy of other Powers, and give rise to political com plications. His Majesty’s Government preferred to adhere to the alternative method of making it clear that they would not tolerate the occupation by any foreign Power of any port or territory in the Persian Gulf, and, in this connection, atten tion was directed to Lord Lansdowne’s declaration, made in the House of Lords on the 5th May, 1903, that “ we should regard the establishment of a naval base or of a for tified port in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very great menace to British interests, and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal.” In these circumstances, His Majesty’s Government had arrived at the conclusion that the flagstaft's on Sheep Island and the Maklab Isthmus should be abandoned, while, in view of the result of Mr. Lorimer’s recent inquiries, which tended to confirm the claim of the Sultan of Muscat to sovereignty over the territory in question, the Government of India were requested to furnish their views as to the maintenance of the flagstaff on Telegraph Island, which had been the site of the original cable station. The Government of India replied in their despatch of the 26th September, 1907, that the flagstaff might conceivably be useful in certain circumstances, having regard to the German desire for an increase of influence in the Gulf, and for a telegraph line to the east; and as neither the Sultan of Muscat nor any foreign Power had ever taken exception to its existence, it seemed very improbable that any inter national complications would arise from its maintenance in the future. The Government of India had already given it as their opinion that the erection of the flagstaft could not be regarded as contravening, in any way, the provisions of the Treatv of 1862, which binds both England and France not to trench on the independence of the Sultan of Muscat; and, in these circum-stances, they recommended that no action should be taken beyond merely leaving the flagstaff on Telegraph Island where it was. No decision has vet been arrived at on this recommendation. The flagstaffs on Sheep Island and Maklab Isthmus were actually removed in October 1905. In October 1907 an Inter-Departmental Com mittee, consisting of three delegates from the Admiralty and representatives of the Foreign Office and India Office, was convened to report on the feasibility of the Germans securing an outlet for the Bagdad Railway on the Persian Gulf independently of British co-operation. The Committee formed the opinion that such a consummation was feasible, and they concluded their Report in the following terms :— “ 'NVe do not, however, feel confident that we possess the means absolutely to debar Germany from acquiring an outlet on the Gull ; and this outlet, though at first com mercial, might eventually be transformed into a strategic base, but by steps so gradual and clandestine as to render protests difficult or impracticable. In these circumstances we cannot but express the opinion that it is in the highest degree desirable to come to terms with the promoters of the Bail way. i “ Finally, we would advocate that all steps which His Majesty’s Government may consider feasilde should be taken to consolidate the advantages we already possess at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, notably at Musandim Peninsula (where the harbour accommodation and w^ater supply are adequate) and at the Islands of Kishm and Henjam.” The Admiralty stated, in a letter dated the 9th November, 1907, that “their Lordships con cur in the Report of the Committee, and they consider that, from a naval standpoint, it is most desirable that effect should be given at once to the Committee’s particular recommendations re lating to the steps to be taken by His Majesty’s Government in the establishment of a definite position .... at the entrance to the Persian Gulf.” The Government of India suggested in their despatch of the 21st January, 1904, that it might be found desirable to erect a lighthouse on Musandirn Peninsula. Further correspondence on the subject took place in the course of the year, and was for- .varded to the Foreign Office in the India Office letter of the 29th September, 1901. It appeared that the Government of India were of opinion21 [1098] G Lighthouse. Wireless Telegraphy. that the light might be placed either on the rocky point of Cape Musandim or on one of the islands called the Quoins that are situated at a little distance from it; they considered that there were political advantages in placing the light upon a point of the peninsula, and they were accordingly disposed to prefer this locality. The British India Steam Navigation Company, who were consulted on the subject, expressed the view that a lighthouse at the extremity of the Musandim Peninsula would be of considerable help to shipping. They recommended that it should he constructed on Cape Musandim rather than on one of the Quoins Islands, provided that the land south of the point would not render the light invisible to ships proceeding up the Gulf. On the 21st September, 1901, the Viceroy telegraphed to inquire whether it would be possible to secure the services of an expert through Trinity House to examine the scheme and also to report on the general question of the lighting of the Persian Gulf. This telegram was referred to tire Poreign Office for Lord Lansdowne’s observations, hut action appears to have been suspended upon it until the question of the flagstaffs at Musandim had been settled, and, as the ultimate decision in regard to the latter was that they should he removed, the lighthouse question appears to have been allowed to drop. The erection of a lighthouse might be of con siderable service, both nautical and political, at Musandim. With regard to the erection of lights and the improvement of harbours in general, the British Besident in the Persian Gulf has expressed the view that, apart from their utilitarian aspect, they would undoubtedly do much to strengthen our already predominant position. The subject will be reverted to Part III of this Memorandum (see p. 94). If a lighthouse is built at Musandim a wireless telegraphy station might likewise he established. This would he of much advantage to passing vessels for purposes of signalling, and it is worthy of consideration whether similar stations should not he established at Bassidu, Bahrein, and on Kubbar Island near Koweit, and wireless instal lations supplied to His Majesty’s ships in the Persian Gulf, with a view to the easier and more effective suppression of piracy.22 (b.) The Trucial Chiefs* The British Government iwaintain no Political Officer in “ Tmeial ” territory, but a Native Agent in the employ of the Bushire Residency is stationed at Shargah, and moves from place to place as is required. The so-called “ Trucial Chiefs,” who rule over the Jowasmi, A1 bu Ali and Beni Yas tribes, are six in number, and they respectively reside at llas-el-Kheimah, Amulgavine, Ajman, Shar gah, Dabai, and Abu Dthabi. All these places are situated on the Pirate Coast, which is part of the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf, and extends from a point between Tibba and Shuam to El Odeid. The Sheikh of Shargah also claims authority over the coast-line on the Gulf of Oman from Khor Kalba as far as Has Dibba, on the ground that it is part of the territories of the Joasim tribe. These Chiefs are called the “Trucial Chiefs” on account of the Treaties of Maritime Truce concluded with them between 1835 and 1853, by which their internecine strife upon the sea was stopped. They are all now independent, and since the isolation of the Wahabees in the highlands, they have been exempted from the tribute or black mail for the payment of which they were formerly directly or indirectly liable to the Wahabee Chief of Nejd. In the beginning of last century an expedition was sent to the Persian Gulf to punish the Jowasmi for certain aggressions on British ships, and to co-operate with the Imam of Muscat who was then at war with them. The expedition resulted in the conclusion of a Treaty in February 1806, binding them to respect the flag and property of the British, and to assist vessels touching on their coast. This Treaty appears to have been concluded without refer ence to the Wahabees. The spread of the Wahabees in Oman soon threatened the Ruler of Muscat with destruction, and the British Government determined to sup port him, and to destroy the piratical fleets as the only means of preserving the peace of the Gulf. A strong force was dispatched in 1809, which took Ras-el-Kheimah and other places and destroyed the boats of the pirates. Notwithstanding these measures, piracy in creased to an intolerable extent, and an expedi- * A report on this subject by Colonel Kemball will be found in “ Persia and Arabia,” Part 12, p. 343 (March 1903).

Giant Keir, in 1819 for the purpose of completely crushing them. In 1820 the first general Treaty was signed between the British Government and the Chiefs, and of these or similar Agreements there have been in all no fewer than eight. In 1839 the Maritime Truce was concluded,, and was renewed from time to time until the year 1853, when it was succeeded by the Treaty of Perpetual Peace which has lasted ever since. Under that Treaty it was provided that there should be a complete cessation of hostilities at sea between the sub jects of the signatory Chiefs, and a “ perfect maritime truce for evermore ; ” that, in the event of aggressions by any one by sea, the injured parties should not retaliate, but should refer the matter to the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, and that the British Government should watch over the peace of the Gulf and insure at all times the observance of the Treaty. In 1892 a further Treaty was concluded separ ately with each of the Trucial Chiefs by which they agreed (1) not to enter into any Agree ment or correspondence with any Power other than the British Government ; (2) not to consent to the residence in their territories of the Agent of any other Government without the assent of the British Government; (3) not to cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation any part of their territory save to the British Govern ment. So long ago as 1823 Captain McLeod, reporting on the Jowasmi tribe (being then at Ras-el- Khaimah and Shargah), described them as “ possessing no articles of export, since their pearls are generally purchased by merchants on the spot, and the produce of their country is not even sufficient for their mainteuance. Their only employment is fishing, diving for pearls, and importing dates, grain, and other necessaries of life which they purchase with the price of those pearls. They are very poor, and perhaps can never find much employment in commerce unless in carrying for others, although it is said they at one time possessed a very extensive trade.” Colonel (now General Sir Arnold) Kemball writing in 1845 remarked :— “ Upon the success of the pearl-fishing and the profits of the carrying trade which it brings into21 operation must depend the means of obtaining the positive necessaries of life and those trifling luxuries desirable to an Arab. It is needless to observe how materially their own condition, and, by an . easily deduced corollary, the safety of the Gulf, might be affected by the failure of a single season. Hence the anxiety and care attended with great expense which has been devoted by our Government to the maintenance of perfect tranquillity and security on the pearl banks.” In his report dated April 1863 on the tribes of the Persian Gulf, Colonel Felly, who was for many years British Resident, wrote as follows:— “ The settlements of these tribes are mainly dependent for subsistence upon the proceeds of their pearl-divings; they possess little territory. As to the pearl banks, these are held in common bv the tribes, and thousands of boats collect there during the diving season to keep the peace. Men must export what they can pro duce or spare, or else they must go without imports; if men situate like these Arabs do not export salt-fish and pearls, they must either turn pirates or starve.” In a Durbar, held at Shargah in November Address of the lfi03, the Viceroy addressed the Chiefs as follows : — Shargah, November 21, “ Chiefs,—Out of the relations that were thus 1 &lt;)03 - created, and which, by your own consent, con stituted the British Government the guardian of intertribal peace, there grew up political ties between the Government of India and yourselves, whereby the British Government became your overlords and protectors, and you have relations with no other Power. Every one of the States known as the Trucial States has found itself, as you know, not to enter into any Agreement or correspondence with any other Power, not to admit the Agent of any other Government, and not to part with any portion of its territories. These engagements are binding on every one of you, and you have faithfully adhered to them. They are also binding in their reciprocal effect upon the British Government, and as long as they are faithfully observed by the Chiefs there is no fear that any one will be allowed to tamper with your rights or liberties. “ Sometimes I think that the record of the past is in danger of being forgotten, and there persons who ask, why should Great Britaincontinue to exercise these powers ? The history of your States and of your families, and the present condition of the Gulf, are the answer. We were here before any other Power in modern times had shown its face in these waters. We found strife, and we have created order. It was. our commerce as well as your security that was threatened and called for protection. At every port along these coasts the subjects of the King of England still reside and trade. The great Empire of India, which it is our duty to defend, lies almost at your gates. We saved you from extinction at the hands of your neighbours. We opened these seas to the ships of all nations, and enabled their flags to fly in peace. We have not. seized or held your territory. We have not destroyed your independence, but have preserved it. We are not now going to throw away this century of costly and triumphant enterprise ; we shall not wipe out the most unselfish page in history. The peace of these waters must still be maintained ; your independence will continue to be upheld; and the influence of the British Government must remain supreme.” (c.) Bahrein. Government of India’s despatch of February 22, 1870 (Abstract), and Bombay Records, vol. xxiv. Erom the eleventh century to the beginning of the sixteenth century the inhabitants of Bahrein, to whom a Persian and Arab descent has been variously assigned, appear to have been subject to Chiefs of their own race, though in the time of Alphonso de Albuquerque the island fell into the possession of the Portuguese, who were eventually deprived of it by a dependent Sheikh of Nejd. During part of the seventeenth century, and for twenty-five years in the latter half of the eighteenth, Bahrein paid tribute to the Shah of Persia. With the death of Karim Khan in 177-1 the influence of Persia began to wane, and the petty Chiefs of the Gulf, whose lawlessness had been controlled by the strong hand of Nadir Shah and his immediate successors, were soon involved in contests for superiority. A section of the Arab tribe of Uttoobees, which had already been settled at Zobara for some years, and had increased so rapidly in wealth and power as to be virtually independent, took advantage of the disturbed state of affairs to attack Bahrein in 1782. In the following year they accomplished [1098] H 1782.26 the subjugation of the island, of which, under varying fortunes, they have retained possession ever since. Under the resolute rule of Syed Sultan, the influence of Muscat had been steadily increasing, and in 1799, at the instance of the Beglerbeg of Fars, the Imam fitted out an expedition which ended in the reduction of Bahrein and the deportation of members of the leading families to Muscat. Those who escaped were not slow to make overtures to the Wahabees, and in 1801 by their aid recovered the island. The influence of Syed Sultan proved, indeed, on his death to have been no more than personal; the ascendency in the Gulf was left with the Wahabees, and the Uttoohees, no less than the other Chiefs of the Littoral, were for some years completely under their control. In 1805, how ever, they tired of their allegiance, and were also disinclined to share in the piratical schemes which the Wahahees systematically encouraged. Their Sheikhs accordingly inquired from the British Resident in the Gulf whether if they retired from the mainland, and withheld their allegiance from the Wahahees, the British Government would supply them with a vessel or two, so as to enable them to remain undisturbed at Bahrein. The Resident recommended that the request should he granted, hut the Bombay Government declined to interfere in the matter. In 1815 the Imam of Muscat attacked the island, hut was repulsed with great loss. At this time the Uttoobees had so far departed from their former policy as to encourage pirates to resort to their ports, in order to dispose of their plunder. In 1820 General Keir negotiated a Treaty with the Brother Chiefs Suliman and Abdulla, who then ruled over the island, stipulating that every possible discouragement should be given to pirates, and admitting them to the benefit of the general Treaty with the friendly Arabs, con cluded about the same time. Id 1822 an Agreement was made by the British Resident at Bushire with the Prince of Shiraz, recognizing Bahrein as a dependency of the Province of Fars. This Agreement was entirely contrary to the views of the Govern ment at Bombay, and letters were written to the Prince of Shiraz disavowing the Treaty in strong terms and announcing the recall of Captain 1799. 1801. 1805. 1815. 1820. 1822.27 Mr. G. Willock, No. 1, January 25, 1822. Mr. Grant-Duff, No. 247, September 26, 1906. 1825. 1831. 1839. Bruce. Not only did the Indian Government disavow the Treaty, hut Mr. G. Willock, British Representative at Tabreez, reported that— “ Mirza Baugur, Anhie, who had been deputed to Court to obtain the ratification of the Treaty, did not meet with a favourable reception; and His Majesty the Shah, whilst refusing his accordance to the stipulations, expressed his dis pleasure that the Prince of Shiraz should have entered into any engagements with the British Government without his knowledge and in junctions.” The 'treaty was therefore not ratified either by the Shah or by the Government of India. This is an important point, since as late as 1906 the Persian Government based their claim to Bahrein on the Treaty of 1822. In 1821 the British Government mediated with success between Bahrein and the kindred house of Rahmah-bin-Jaubir of Demaum. In the following year Suliman died, and was succeeded by his son Khalifa, but the latter’s uncle, Abdulla, managed to retain all real power in his own hands. The Imam of Muscat w r as in favour of active intervention on behalf of Khalifa; the Governor of Bombay warned him of the evils which would flow from such a step, hut his advice proved unavailing. As, however, Khalifa was prompt in his opposition to the common enemy, the Imam was utterly routed, and theUttoobees, elated by success, took the initiative, . and protested their unwillingness to agree to any terms of peace which were not guaranteed by the British Government ; finally, in 1831, the desultory warfare which had ensued fizzled out from inanition. In 1839, on the irruption of the Egyptian army into Nejd, Sheikh Abdulla won over the Commander, by the promise of an annual tribute, to undertake that he would not encroach on Bahrein. The British Government, who at this time were watching with anxiety the progress of the Egyptian troops, expostulated with the Sheikh on the way in which lie was sacrificing his independence ; he admitted, in answer, that he would be prepared to drop all further con nection with the Egyptian Pasha and ‘‘avow himself a dependant of Great Britain,” in return for a guarantee of protection. The speedy with- 7SoM drawal of the Egyptian army from Nejd made any further negotiations on this subject un necessary. The dissensions amongst the various members of the ruling family of Bahrein had by this time reached such a pitch as to give the greatest cause of anxiety for the safety of the Gulf. Khalifa died in 1834, and was succeeded by his son, Mahomed. Between the latter and his great- uncle, Sheikh Abdulla, there had alwavs been * jealousy, and in a short time civil war broke out, and finally led to the discomfiture of Abdulla and his expulsion from the island. In 1845 the British Government exerted their influence at Bahrein, when they objected to the interference of Persia, and ordered the exiled Sheikh Abdulla to abstain from disturbinsr the peace of the Gulf. In 1847 the ruling Sheikh, Mahomed-bin- Khalifa, offered allegiance to Great Britain, which, however, was refused, though he was assured of the continuance of the good-will and friendship of the British Government, In ] 848 Abdulla died, but the feud with the Khalifa family was vigorously maintained by his son, Mahomed-bin-Abdulla; and the history of the period which intervened up to the time (1859) that the latter was declared a public enemy and confined by the Government of India in the fort of Assurghur, resembles in every essential the history of preceding days. Piratical outrages were frequent; the Resident’s advice was asked only to be disregarded ; agreements were broken as soon as made ; trade languished; the common people were oppressed ; the Waha- bees, egged on by a restless ambition, aided and abetted Mahomed-bin-Abdulla; and, finally, when a descent on Bahrein was imminent, the British Government were compelled to expel the rival Sheikh from his asylum at Demaum. Shortly afterwards the ruling Sheikh, on being remonstrated with on account of certain lawless acts, declared his allegiance first to Persia, and afterwards to Turkey. He was compelled by the British Resident to raise the blockade of the Wahabee ports which he had instituted, and, in 1861, a “ Perpetual Treaty of Peace and Eriend- ship” was concluded with him. By this the engagements entered into in 1820 were declared to be valid and in (force, the Chief as “ Inde pendent Ruler of Bahrein ” bound himself to 1845. 1847. 1848. 1869. 186129 Mr. Hertslet’s Memorandum of March 1874, p. 13. 1869. 1868. 1869. 1871 abstain from prosecuting war, piracy, and slavery by sea, and the British Government on their part engaged to maintain the security of his territory against foreign aggression. Her Majesty’s Government, having concluded this Treaty with the Sheikh as an independent ruler, informed the Persian Government of what had taken place, and refused to concur in a pro posal made by the Shah that the sovereignty of Bahrein should he transferred to the Persian Crown. Sir H. Rawlinson, then Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, expressed in forcible terms how indispensable the maintenance of the Sheikh’s independence (of Persia) was “to the successful working of those plans of maritime police in the Persian Gulf which we have been at so much pains and expense to establish.” In 1868, in consequence of the intrigues of the Persian Government, who had encouraged the piratical faction, it was necessary for the Indian Government to take forcible action against the offending Chiefs, and a naval demon stration took place. In November 1869 further measures had to he adopted, two of the Chiefs were incarcerated in an Indian fortress, and, finally, Esa-bin-Ali, a member of the Khalifa family, was installed as ruling Sheikh of Bahrein, and has remained in power ever since. In 1870 the Government of India wrote a full despatch reviewing the history of the island and emphasizing the importance of allowing no Persian claims to sovereignty to pass without firm remonstrance The Duke of Argyll, then Her Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for India, concurred in this view. In the autumn of 1871, during the progress of the Turkish expedition against Nejd, the murder of a Turkish messenger by order of the Chief of Bahrein re-opened the question of the Ottoman claim to the island. This claim Her Majesty’s Government had already refused to recognize on three occasions, in 1839, 1851, and 1870. At the request of Her Majesty’s Ambas sador, the Ottoman Minister for Poreign Affairs eventually repeated the verbal assurances, for merly given by Aali Pasha, that the Porte did not entertain any intention of obtaining supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, or the inde pendent tribes of Southern Arabia, nor con- [1098] I4* 30 template any. attack upon them. {Vide Sir H. Elliot’s despatch No. 399 of the 4th November, 1871.) In October 1873 a question arose regarding the enforced enlistment of natives of Bahrein into the Turkish Army. A note was accordingly addressed to the Turkish Ambassador on the 14th April, 1874, which after drawing his Excellency’s attention to previous communications, distinctly stated that Her Majesty’s Government did not admit the claim of Turkey to consider Bahrein as part of the Ottoman Dominions, and that, if natives of that island applied to British Consuls in Turkey for protection, the latter could not refuse their good offices on behalf of such persons. In June 1879 the British Ambassador at Constantinople was instructed to make repre sentations respecting a reported proposal to establish a Turkish coal dep6t at Bahrein, and to urge the Porte to disavow the project. Action was also taken by the Indian Government in order to induce the Sheikh of Bahrein, in the event of the proposal being made to him, to act upon the advice of the British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. An attempt was actually made in 1880 by a Turkish vessel to establish a coaling station at Bahrein, but was frustrated by the Sheikh, who refused permission for the undertaking. As a result of this incident, the Sheikh was induced to conclude a Treaty with the British Government by which he undertook to abstain from entering into negotiations with any other Power, and to refuse permission to any other Government to establish agencies or coaling depots on his territory. in 188S-9 the Turkish claim to Bahrein was re-asserted and refuted. The Ottoman Govern ment were informed that any attempt to land on the island would be opposed by force {vide despatches No. 15 of the 26th January, 1888, and No. 121 of the 17th April, 1888, to Sir W. White). A question of British protection over Bah- reinese in Turkey arose in 1892 over the resti tution of taxes levied at Bussorah, and Her Majesty’s Ambassador reminded the Porte that, Bahrein being under British protection, Her Majesty’s Government could not admit Turkish interference with the natives of the island. A landing of Turkish troops was again appre- 1874. To Sir H. Layard, v No. 763, Juno 5, 1879. Sir H Layard, No. 504, June 16, 1879. India Office, September 20. 1879.

In 1892 an Agreement was made with the Chief of Bahrein providing against (1) conclu sion of Treaties with foreign Powers, (2) resid ence of foreign Agents, (3) cession of territory. The question of British protection of Bah- reinese in the Ottoman Dominions again arose in 1893, and Her Majesty’s Government maintained the right of British Consular Bepresentatives to give their good offices to Bahreinese applying for them, and the Porte was subsequently informed that Her Majesty’s Government would extend their protection to them whenever there was occasion. In 1895 we forcibly dispersed, in tbe interests of tbe Bahrein Sheikh, a settlement of malcon tents who had established themselves at Zobara, on the El Katr coast, under the Turkish flag. The Turks protested, but Her Majesty’s Govern ment stated in reply that “ they did not recognize Turkish jurisdiction on the El Katr coast, and must repeat once more that all Turkish claims to Bahrein, which is under the protection of the Queen of England, are totally inadmissible.” The intervention of British Consuls in Turkey on behalf of Bahreinese was again insisted upon in 189G. In 1898 the Indian Government formally recognized Sheikh Hamed as successor-designate to the Chiefship of the island. In 1900 a British Agent, Mr. Gaskin, was stationed at Bahrein instead of the native repre sentative. In January 1905 the Government of India appointed Captain Prideaux, an officer of the regular political service, to succeed Mr. Gaskin, who was of lower official status. Subsequently, they conferred upon Captain Prideaux the personal and local rank of Political Agent. An assistant surgeon was also appointed at this time, and, in addition to attending on the Agency staff, he is in charge of a hospital, recently erected at the cost of certain British Indian merchants, in commemoration of Her late Majesty Queen Victoria; a guard, consisting of four officers and twenty-four sepoys, was stationed in the island; and a launch was pro vided to enable the Agent to visit the outlying portions of his charge, and for service in the suppression of piracy in tbe shallower water32 which a British gun-boat cannot reach. The use of the launch will confirm our title to police the pearl banks. The reason for these measures was explained by the Government of India in a despatch dated the 21st April, 1901 :— The protection of the British Government had converted the island from a scene of chronic external aggression and intestine feud into a relatively peaceful and flourishing centre of industry and commerce; but, secure in the gratuitous enjoyment of the benefits thus con ferred upon him, and oblivious of the past vicis situdes of' the Khalifa familv, the Chief had been induced, by the very moderation of the British Government, to the belief that bis re lations with them were of a kind involving no corresponding obligations on bis part. The incorrectness of the Sheikh’s attitude had been conspicuously noticeable in connection with the question of the Customs revenues (a point dealt with under a separate heading of this Memorandum''. The Government of India were not then disposed on this account to have recourse to coercive measures, in the hope that the object in view would be effected by means which, if slower, might not prove less effective. They apprehended that the Sheikh would not be slow to recognize the significance of the means in question, and that a suitable officer would be able to bring pressure to bear in con nection with the Customs question or any other matter. Apart, however, from affairs of domestic interest, the need for a more definite assertion of our position had recently come into greater pro minence o wing to the establishment of an enter prising German trader on the island, and by reason of the growing interest in this quarter displayed by foreigners of other nationalities. Tiie expectations of the Government of India as to the reformation of the Sheikh were unfor tunately destined to be disappointed, and his incapacity as a Ruler found concrete expression in disturbances which took place in Kovember India Office, 1901, when a German clerk was assaulted and ^oj^mber 2y, several Persians were wounded. In the case of the German, as a result of the India Office, a , |, . . , . . . „ . January 18, 1905. action or the British Agent, lull compensation was paid and condign punishment publicly inflicted. As to the Persians, the Sheikh remained „3905. Admiralty, April 1, 1905. India Office, October 20, 1905. 1904. Memorandum communicated by M. Cambon, July 27, 1904. India Office. August 31, 1904.

On the 27th July, 1904, the French Ambassador communicated a private Memorandum to Lord Lansdowne, suggesting that, as French citizens had established themselves at Bahrein for the purpose of pearl-fishing, the jurisdiction of the Irench Vice-Consul at Bushire should be ex tended to that island. The India Office were disposed to agree to the proposal, provided the French Vice-Consul addressed his representations to the British Political Agent. On this point the Government of India stated that they would only recognize the French Vice-Consul at Bushire as Vice- Consul for Manama (Bahrein) on the clear understanding (1) that his exequatur be obtained from His Majesty’s Government; (2) that his dealings be with the British Political Officer alone; (3) that he should acquire no extra territorial jurisdiction. The Government of India furtln r stated that they preferred postponement of the question until our position as regards the pearling banks had been established, especially as it had been raised in connection with the proposed pearling enterprise of the French, to which the Arabs objected. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf stated that, subject to the conditions suggested by the India Office, the appointment would perhaps be a useful recognition of our quasi British Protectorate over Bahrein; and he should for this reason have recommended acceptance, if the motive had not been the admitted desire of French merchants to gain access to the pearl fisheries. The Government of India were of opinion that the best solution was to drop the question, and this seems to have been done. Bahrein Customs. The administration of the Customs at Bahrein, which is a minor centre of the arms traffic, has for a considerable time engaged the anxious attention of the Government of India. [1098] K34 They are at present leased to and farmed by British-Indian Banias. So far back as 1698, the Political Resident in 1898. the Persian Golf broached the subject with the Government of ^ , . i i i ii j India’s despatch of Chief, who gave Colonel Meade to understand that ^pril 21, 1904 . he would not renew the farmer s lease without first India Office, communicating with him. Despite this under- JjIie8 ’ 1Ju4 - standing, the lease w r as subsequently extended for a period of two years. Shortly afterwards the Sheikh again promised not to enter into any fresh contract without first informing the Resi dent. But in January 1900 Colonel Meade 1900. reported that the Sheikh had again departed from his engagements, and had prolonged the lease for a further term of tw r o years, without previous intimation. A. remonstrance w r as made, and the Chief expressed regret; but, neverthe less, when in 1901, at the instance of Sir N. 1901. O’Conor, it was again suggested that he should employ a British subject to supervise the Customs, he once more declined to accede to the wishes of Ilis Majesty’s Government. On the occasion of his tour in the Persian 1913. Gulf in 1903, the Yiceroy spoke seriously about the matter to the Chief, and pointed mt to him the necessity of a. change in the existing arrangements. The Sheikh asked for time for reflection; but this only resulted in his reas serting his unwillingness to redress the abuses which had called forth complaints. The conclusions formulated on the subject by 7 1904. the Government of India are indicated in their despatch of the 21st April, 1904 :— “ Tho need for reform is clearly indicated by the figures given in Colonel Kemball’s letter. The Chief’s present income from his Customs is 1,16,200 rupees, while the revenue which may be expected under an efficient system is estimated at 3,50,000 rupees. The practicability of the change is proved by the example of Muscat, where, in partial compliance with our wishes, the Sultan has taken the Customs administration under direct management, and has already reaped considerable benefit from the arrangement. The matter is obviously one to which we cannot remain indifferent. Committed, as w 7 e are, to the support of Sheikh Hamed, it is incumbent on us to take Measures to insure that, on his accession, he may find his house in order, and may not be burdened with a heavy legacy of debt accumulated by the improvidence of bis predecessor. For this reason we consider that the question is not one which can be allowed to drop, even if it were possible to overlook the Sheikh’s repeated breaches of faith and his persistently contumacious attitude with regard to it. In fact, the■ f_ 35 reform of the Customs administration of Bahrein has become a test case of the nature and degree of the influence which the British Government may reasonably claim to exercise over the Ruler of those islands.” 1006. In August 1906 a further attempt was made by the Resident to induce the Sheikh to intrust the collection of the customs to the Government of India for a specific sum, in place of farming them out to the Bania-British Indian contractors. He declined to adopt this course, and the matter was temporarily allowed to drop. It is suggested that the real ground of the refusal is to be found in the fact that Bahrein is the centre of a large smuggling trade. Judicial Powers exercised hy the Political Agent at Bahrein. 1907 The Government of India raised this subject in their despatch of the 14th November, 1907, which is now under consideration, and of which the following is an extract :— “ The Agent has at present the powers of a Magistrate of the 1st class, as described in ‘ The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898,’ in respect of offences committed by native Indian subjects of His Majesty in the Island of Bahrein and on the southern shores of the Persian Gulf. He also extends his good offices* to European foreigners in any disputes between them and the Chief of Bahrein or bis subjects. “ Next, he holds a Court, composed of himself and a representative of the Chief, for the trial of cases in which the accused is a Bahrein subject or a foreigner who prefers not to invoke British good offices, and the other party is a British or foreign subject who does so. “ Finally, he controls a local Court of Arbitra tion for the adjustment of civil disputes between British subjects and protdgds on the one hand, and Bahrein subjects or persons of any other nationality, on the other hand. This Court has been in existence for over fifty years. “ He also, on occasions, issues bills of health, signs marine protests, and legalizes signatures on behalf of British Indian subjects. Strictly Vide Secret despatch from Secretary of State, dated36 ■N speaking, however, he has no legal authority for undertaking these latter duties. “ With a view to define and regularize the powers exercized over British subjects by the Agent, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has put forward the suggestion that he should be appointed to be a Justice of the Peace and endowed with the powers of a District Judge in direct subordination to the High Court of Bombay. We concur in this recommendation, but, with reference to clause 2 of ‘ The Indian Foreign Jurisdiction Order in Council, 1902/ we understand that it would first be necessary for Bahrein to be declared by His Majesty in Council to be a territory in which jurisdiction is exercised by, or on behalf of, His Majesty through the Governor-General in Council. We would ac cordingly request that, if His Majesty's Govern ment see no objection, the necessary Order in Council maybe passed providing for the exercise of jurisdiction in Bahrein. “ But further, in view of the increase of foreign shipping and foreign interest generally in the Gulf, and of the establishment of foreign firms and missions in Bahrein, which has alreadv caused practical difficulties, it seems desirable that, if possible, in maintenance of the status quo in the Gulf, provision should be made in the Order in Council for the exercise by the Political Agent of jurisdiction over foreigners in Bahrein, before foreign interests have so largely developed as to render the assumption of the legal duties of a Protecting Power a matter of greater intricacy and difficulty involving perhaps, as in the case of Zanzibar, diplomatic representations to foreign Powers. Bahrein has been under sole British domination since 1820, and on several occasions we have had to interfere by armed force, either to prevent the Chief of Bahrein from attacking his neighbours, or them from attacking him, or to settle matters relating to the Chiefship. In 1880, by a Treaty published for public infor mation, the Sheikh bound himself to abstain from making Treaties of any sort with any State or Government other than the British, and to refuse to permit other Powers to establish Diplomatic or Consular Agencies or coaling depots without the consent of the British Govern ment. This Treaty in itself constituted a sort of protectorate, which has perhaps been ripened into maturity by the open and regular exercise of37 31 protectorate Powers, more especially in the recent cases of attacks on Persian and German subjects in Bahrein “If His Majesty’s Government consider it feasible in the circumstances to assume juris diction over foreigners in Bahrein, we would recommend that this should be done, and also that the Order in Council should, if possible, he so framed as to enable the Political Agent to perform the functions of a notary public.” Summary. The political position at Bahrein may be summarized as follows :— His Majesty’s Government have repudiated the Persian claim to sovereignty nine times—in 1822, 1825, 1844, 1848, 1861, 1862, 1869, 1906, and 1907, and the Turkish claim nineteen times in 1839, 1851, 1870, 1874 (twice), 1875, 1876, 1879, 1888, 1892 (twice), 1893 (three times), 1895 (twice), 1896, and 1905 (twice); while in 1871 the Grand Vizier of Turkey gave a formal assurance “ that the Porte entertained no intention whatever of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrein.” On the other hand, His Majesty’s Government have themselves had direct relations with Bahrein since 1805; these relations have become increas ingly intimate in character, and have found concrete expression in a series of Treaties concluded in 1820, 1847, 1856, H61, 1868, 1880, and 1892, and having as their objects the suppression of piracy and the slave trade, the regularity of the succession to the throne, the protection of the island against foreign control or aggression, and the assertion of British predomin ance. His Majesty’s Government have repeatedly, and with increasing authority, intervened in the internal affairs of the island, notably in 1845, in 1859 w r hen the rival Sheikh was incarcerated in an Indian fortress, in 1861, in 1869 wdien a naval demonstration took place, in 1898 to recognize the ruJing Sheikh’s son as successor-designate to the Ohiefship, and again in 1904-5 forcibly to effect the punishment of offenders who had assailed German and* Persian subjects, and to remove certain abuses affecting public security and the welfare of foreigners. Moreover, in virtue of the Treaty of 1861, the British Agent has exercised important judicial powers in the [1098] L38 «« island for over fifty years; for nearly a century the safety of the pearl industry, of which Bahrein is the centre, has been assured by British ships; and British Consular protection has been regularly afforded to Bahreinese in Turkey and in Persia. It would now seem to be matter for serious consideration whether the time has not arrived to regularize the position at Bahrein by a more definite assertion of British predominance. The Government of India, in their despatch already quoted (see page 35), have set forth the argu ments in favour of the exercise of jurisdiction over foreigners, and the advantages of adopting such a course before foreign interests have so largely developed as to render the assumption of the lesral duties of a Protecting Power a matter of greater intricacy and difficulty. The question arises whether it would not be more practicable and be less likely to evoke hostile comment if the assumption of these duties (which would probably necessitate a notification to foreign Powers) were accompanied by various administrative reforms, which, carried out under Britisli control, would conduce to the general prosperity of commerce, check the traffic in arms which now exists, and gradually place the revenue of the Sheikh upon a more stable footing. That such reforms are desirable has been recognized by the Government of India in earlier despatches ; unfortunately, though steps iu the right direction have been taken, no substantial improvement has been effected since the native Agent was succeeded by a British Agent in 1900. Writing in this year, Mr. Zwemer, an American missionary resident at Bahrein, asserted that “ Oppression, blackmail, and bribery are universal, and except in commerce and the Slave Trade, English protection has brought about no reforms in the island. To be ‘ pro tected ’ means here strict neutrality as to the internal affairs, and absolute dictation as to affairs with other Governments.” It is much to be regretted that the negotia tions for the control of the customs proved abortive, and, in view of the increasing im portance of Bahrein, it is worth while con sidering whether the Sheikh should not be offered a large subsidy in return for the customs, which, under British control, would, no doubt, give a far larger yield. It is eminently desirable in the interests of the island that the finances should be reformed, Jurisdiction over Foreigners. Administrative Reforms. Customs Control. Financial Reform.39 Public Works. in order that certain public works, and more especially harbour accommodation and the con struction of a pier, may be undertaken. The development of trade on any considerable scale is largely dependent upon the execution of such works. Moreover, it is incumbent upon the Government of India to take timely steps to provide against a deficit on the demise of the present Sheikh, to whose successor, Sheikh Hamed, they are committed. The Customs question has also separate import ance in connection with the Arms Traffic. It should be borne in mind that at one period Bahrein was renowned for its fertility, and that it is capable under wise government of becoming so again. It possesses an excellent water supply, and the climate is far more suited to Europeans than that of Kishm or Muscat. Situated . about half way between Cape Musandim and the mouth of the Shat- el-Arab, in geographical position it possesses advantages as a trade centre which are superior to those of any other place in the Gulf under present conditions. Some idea of the commerce of the island may be derived from the fact that the export of pearls from there was 470,000/. in 1901, and the total trade of Bahrein increased 30 per cent, between 1905 and 1906, when it reached 1,454,000/. exclusive of pearls. Of the steam tonnage entered in the port in 1906, British vessels represented 100,983 tons; American, 3,913; and German, 6,205. If a British u Commissioner ” with commercial aptitudes could he appointed to control the customs and gradually to facilitate the establish- Free Port under British Control, ment of a trade emporium and of an open market, such action would go far to promote the commercial interests of this country. More over, such a state of affairs could not fail to attract in still greater numbers than at present the merchants of Lingah and other places, where the appearance of the Belgian Customs officials has given rise to much dissatisfaction. It appears very desirable to anticipate German Bank. action by opening a hank at Bahrein, and some Bombay house might be approached in this connection. Bahrein being the centre of the pearl industry, and in close proximity to the coast of El Katif, which is infested with pirates, the installation of wireless telegraphic communication between the Wireless Telegraphy.island and His Majesty’s ships would prove of value, while the commercial advantages of estab lishing telegraphic intercourse with the outside world are apparent. Writing in 19 J4 Sir X. O’Conor, who had been consulted in regard to the steps which were in contemplation for improving the status and position of the British Agent, replied that he had felt strongly for some years past that we were losing the opportunity of jisserting our supremacy at Bahrein, that he sincerely welcomed the pro posals of the Government of India, and that he undertook that the Turkish Government should raise no serious difficulties. Sir Lewis Belly, writing in 1863, strongly advocated the establishment of a free port under British control in the Persian Gulf. He wrote as follows : — “ The case of Horrnuz is a precedent for a like station ; the interferences, incertitude, and want of accurate knowledge of the market all round the Gulf point to the alleviation of these evils by the creation of a general entrepbt at a convenient point, where all vessels would, if they pleased toeall, find cargo ready; whereto all boats findingafavour able chance for exports from their several jurisdic tions could runacargo in a few days,and whereto all trade might converge, as circumstances admitted, from ports subjected to sudden, but not per manent, arbitrary interference. “ My respectful suggestion to Government is, that the formation of a port so concentrating all our interests would do more to create and to develop the trade of the Gulf and Bussorah line, and would do more to keep the Government accurately informed as to their relations and the condition of commerce in the Gulf, and would further do more to keep the maritime Arabs quiet, and to afford an issue for whatever capa bilities of trade may be possessed by Arabia, than could all the reports, all the figured statements, and all the amicable interviews of all the Resi dents and all the native authorities, that ever had, or may have, place round these waters. “ But the port must be really free, and all tribes and people must know and feel it to be free; and that, once there, their goods and persons are secure and unmolested. Let the authorities of the port limit their functions to keening the peace, removing obstacles, enforcing Sir N. O’Conor, No. 511, June 28, 1904.41 Sir C. Ford, No. 153, April 23, 1H93.

I think that thus only can we practically test the commercial capabilities of the Gulf.” (d.) ElKatr, or Guttur. The El Katr peninsula lies south of Ujair, in the district of El Katif. Ujair is the most southerly point to which, with the important exception of Koweit, II is Majesty’s Government have recognized continuous Turkish influence. On the other hand, it is noith of El Odeid, to which, in 1878, the Sheikh of Abu Dthabi was allowed to assert his rights of possession, and which now forms the western limit of the territories of the Trucial Chiefs. The greater part of the country between El Katif and El Odeid is sparsely inhabited by Bedouin tribes who find pasturage there for their flocks. On the coast are fishing villages, such as Ujair, Zobara, Khor Hassan, El Bidaa and Wakra, the most considerable being El Bidaa. The question of sovereignty over El Katr has never been definitely decided, and to some extent this region has been regarded as debateable land, between Oman on the one side, and the Wahabee Power on the other. At one time the Chief of Abu Dthabi is said to have exercised authority on the actual peninsula. Later the Uttobees, having settled there and at Bahrein, became paramount. These in turn had to pay religious tithe to the Wahabee Ameer, who established a Governor of his own at El Bidaa; and threatened to occupy the Bahrein Islands in 1851. This was prevented by the appearance on the scene of British vessels of war, and an arrangement was come to by which the town of El Bidaa was restored to the Bahrein Chief. There was considerable correspondence in 1872 about a Turkish expedition to Nejd. As a result the Turks remained established in the El Hasa district, and at El Katif on the coast, while a military post was created at El Bidaa, and has been maintained there ever since. A question was raised at this time as to certain rights claimed by the Sheikh of Bahrein over the mainland coast, and in regard to the status of El Odeid. The British Resident, Colonel Felly, was of [1098] M42 opinion that, while Bahrein should be acknow ledged to possess certain rights in regard to pasturage, &amp;c., those rights should not he held as empowering the Sheikh to put to sea for the purpose of coercing any_ port in El Katr. He regarded El Odeid as properly belonging to Abu Dthabi. In a Memorandum by the Rev. Mr. Badger on Turkish claims to Oman, he wrote that the native annals of the province incontestably prove that it became independent of the Bagdad Khalifate in the 10th centurv, and had never since been subject to foreign rule except to the Persians for a short time. He went on to say that the same was true of the Arab Chiefdoms in the Persian Gulf, and that their independence was virtually admitted by Turkey in 1847. On the 7th May, 1883, Lord Granville wrote toMusurus Pasha that “ the claim of the Porte to rights of sovereignty over the El Katr coast has never been admitted by Her Majesty’s Govern ment.” In 1895 His Majesty’s Government forcibly dispersed, in the interests of the Bahrein Sheikh, a settlement of malcontents who had established themselves at Zobara, on the El Katr coast, under the Turkish flag (see p. 31). The Turks protested, but His Majesty’s Government stated in reply that they did not recognize Turkish jurisdiction on the El Katr coast {note verbule of the 12th August 1895). The present position is, therefore, that we have refused to recognize Turkish authority in El Katr, although we have acquiesced in the con tinued presence of a Turkish post since 1872 at El Bidaa. We did, however, object to an attempt by the Turkish Government to appoint a Mudir at Wakra, a point south of El Bidaa; and after considerable pressure they cancelled the appoint ment. The Government of India were not completely satisfied with this result, and desired to round off their relations with the various Arab Chiefs by making an agreement with the leading Sheikh of El Katr. A former Agreement was concluded in 1868 with the then Sheikh, by which he bound himself to take no hostile action by sea, and to refer all disputes to the British Resident. On the death of this Sheikh, his successor, Sheikh Jasim, applied for a renewal of the Agreement, but this was Mr. Townley, No. 8G8, NovemVjer 8, 1904. India Office Memorandum, January 30, 190, r ).43 Sir N. O’Conor, No. 516, June 28, 1904. refused (in 1882) on the ground of the nature of his relations with the Turks. In 1904 the Government of India expressed forcibly their view that a Treaty should be nego tiated with Sheikh Ahmed, in anticipation of the death of Sheikh Jasim, who had then reached an advanced age. An opportunity of making such a Treaty had arisen through the disturbance of the status quo by the Turkish- Government, who had appointed officials to Wakra and other places on the coast. The Government of India at first proposed that a Treaty should be entered into with Sheikh Ahmed on the lines of the existimr Treaties with Bahrein and the Trucial Chiefs, by which he would be debarred from parting with territory to others than the British Government. Although in deference to British remonstrances the Turkish Government had at length withdrawn their interloping officials, the Government of India remained of opinion that the position of Great Britain should be consolidated by the immediate conclusion with Sheikh Ahmed of a Treaty similar to the former one (of 1868), if the stricter form of Treaty with Bahrein and the Trucial Chiefs were held to be inadmissible. The principal reasons adduced in favour of this course were— 1. The El Katr Coast, lying as it does between Bahrein and the Pirate Coast, constitutes a break in the continuity of British maritime influence. 2 . The absence of a Treaty does not facilitate, and may considerably increase, the work of His Majesty’s ships in suppressing piracy and main taining the peace of the Gulf. In this connection it is observed that one objection to the extension of Turkish authority in those regions is the inability of the Turks to establish a strong Administration, which is eminently desirable in a district which, owing to its proximity to Bahrein —the centre of the pearl fisheries—affords excep tional inducements to pirates and marauders. These considerations did not, however, over come the disinclinations of His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinojfie, who w T as keenly alive to the difficulties which such a course might provoke with the Ottoman Government. His Excellency laid stress upon the multiplicity of pending questions with Turkey, such as the energetic action being taken to secure the removal of the Turkish post from Bubiyan Island, and he was distinctly of opinion that. munder existing circumstances, the conclusion of a Treaty as proposed would be inopportune. It was decided that the question should be submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence, who do not appear to have recorded any definite opinion. In a Minute dated the 5th February, 1905, Lord Lansdowne wrote as follows :— “ I feel strongly that the time has come when all these questions, should be considered, not as we have been in the habit of considering them— piecemeal and as they arise—but as parts of a Persian Gulf policy, the principles of which should be carefully laid down for our guidance.” (e.) The IVahabees. To appreciate the present political conditions and recent history of Arabia it is necessary to go back to the year 1742, which marks the rise of the remarkable Wahabee movement, which was at the bottom of all the political changes that the peninsula has seen since that time. Colonel Pelly alluded to the subject in the following terms:— “ It is this Nejd power, occupying the wide centre of Adnan Arabia, and composed of nomadic or only partially stationary Arab tribes, some now in revolt and some now used for quelling revolt, that threatens or dominates all round the shore-line from the back of the Euphrates and Shat-el-Arab, down along the Pirate Coast, and thence round Cape Musandim, along Muscat, Oman, to Ras-el-Had, on the Aden line. “ It was a Kazee or Mullah of Bussorah, named Wahab, who (or whose son), permeating these tribes with the metamorphic agency of a religious idea, fused them into an aggressive mass, which, cropping out along the shore-lines of Muscat and the western coast of the Persian Gulf, compelled all these subdued tribes into plunder and piracy. Hence the once notorious appeal ance of the maritime Arabs as pirates; lienee our expeditions to the west coast of the Gulf ; and hence the Ras-el-Kheimahs and Beni- bu-Alis blending with our colours. An Arab Sheikh endeavoured to explain to me the nature of this unenduring Wahabee power by likening it to the agency of Lord Clive in conquering}S 45 Aitchison, vol. x, p. 116.

The leading tenets* of Wahab’s faith seem to have been those common to prophets, to proclaim himself and the unity of the Creator and kill or plunder his immortal creatures.” ^ British Relations with the Wahabees. [Communicated by the India Office.] In April 1866 the then Wahabee Amir, Imam Abdullah-bin-Fysul, entered into a voluntary engagement with the British Government (in the form of a declaration, which was not signed on our side), by which he bound himself— 1 . Not to oppose or injure British subjects residing in territories under his authority. 2 . Not to “ injure or attack the territories of the Arab tribes in alliance with the British Government, specially on the Kingdom of Muscat, further than in receiving the zukut that has been customary of old.” With the decline of the Wahabee power and the withdrawal of their influence from politics on the coast, the above engagement ceased to be of practical value, and all relations between the Wahabees and ourselves came to an end. It is worth recording that in October 1901, at a time of serious intertribal disturbances in the interior of Arabia, we came to an understanding with the Turkish Government that we would do what we could to discourage the Sheikh of Koweit from aggressive action, on the under standing that the Turks would endeavour to restrain the Amir of Nejd. The successes of the present Wahabee Amir, Abdul Aziz-bin-Saoud, over his rival the Amir of Nejd (Abdul Aziz-bin-Bashid) again brought the Wahabee question to the front. In February 1904, when the Government of India were considering a proposal to send an Agent to Biadh, the Wahabee capital, for the purpose of collecting information on Central Arabian affairs, Mr. Brodrick telegraphed to the Viceroy as follows:— * What most offended the rig-id monotheism of Wahab’s philosophy was the almost universal visitation of shrines, invocation of saints, and honour paid to the tomb of Mahomined. The use of the rosary, of jewels, wine, and tobacco were all abominations to be eschewed. On the other hand, the prophet married twenty wives, and died at the age of 95 after begetting eighteen children. [1098] N46 “No steps should be taken to enter into closer relations with Nejd, or send Agents there, without previous sanction of His Majesty’s Government.” Sir N. O’Conor, who was consulted, while Sir N. O’Conor to Lord Lansdowne. recognizing the advantages of obtaining tuller February 26, idol information as to affairs in the interior of Arabia, held that the moment was not opportune for the action suggested ; and to this opinion the Govern ment of India, after receiving the views of Colonel Kemball, the Resident in the Persian Gulf, subscribed in a despatch dated the 24th Government of * liifiist s letter March, 1904. They considered, however, that, March 24, 1904. in view of recent developments of the situation, there was reason to think that “ it may shortly he incumbent on us to take a more lively interest in the affairs of Central Arabia,” and they added that: “ later when the political situation in Nejd has developed, and above all if the present representative of the AVahabee family .... succeeds in establishing and ex tending his ascendancy, which from the latest accounts received seems to be not improbable, we think that it may be desirable again to enter into relations with our old ally.” The successes of Bin Saoud in April 1904 led ^N^O’C^noj t° the Turkish Government to send troops and guns April 26 and to the assistance of Bin Rashid. Bin Saoud Ma y 4, 1904. • Viceroy s thereupon wrote to the Resident in the Persian telegram, Gulf on the 2nd May, 1904, protesting against May 20,1904. the Turkish invasion and soliciting the protection of Great Britain for himself and his country. At the same time the Resident received from Sheikh Mubarak of Ivoweit a letter addressed to the latter by Bin Saoud, in which he hinted that, if he failed to obtain British protection, he might have to fall back on the Russian offer of assistance made to him in 1903. The Govern ment of India, in reporting this on the 20th May, suggested that it might become necessary to revive the proposal to post a British Resident at Koweit, in order to watch events, should the Turks persist in armed intervention. Sir N. O’Conor had already been instructed, on the 10th May, 1904, to point out to the Porte that His Majesty’s Government, in the hope of assisting to preserve the peace, had “employed special efforts to dissuade the Sheikh of Koweit from taking part, even indirectly, in the hostilities that have broken out,” and to protest against any action being taken by the Turkish Govern- Lord Lansdowne to Sir N.

Mr. Brodrick’s telegram, June 24, 1904. ment “ which might add still further to the disturbed condition of this part of Arabia.” On receipt of the Viceroy’s telegram of the 20th May, 1904, Sir N. O’Conor was further in structed by telegraph to communicate at once with the Porte, and to repeat in urgent terms the representations he had already been instructed to make. Sir N. O’Conor replied on the 23rd May that it was difficult to see on what grounds the Porte could be pressed to refrain from assisting the Amir of Nejd, wdio was the party attacked. He considered that we should coniine ourselves for the present to maintaining intact the territory of Koweit and awaiting developments, but that, if the Turks persisted in rendering assistance to Bin Rashid, it might be expedient to reconsider the question of appointing a British Resident at Koweit. The substance of Sir N. O’Conor’s views was telegraphed to India on the 24th May. In reply the Government of India, in a telegram dated the 29th May, suggested that Sir N. O’Conor should he instructed to inform the Porte that we had no desire to assist Bin Saoud directly or indirectly, but that if, as a result of Turkish support, Bin Rashid became unduly powerful, our interests in Eastern Arabia might be injuriously affected. They held that British prestige at Koweit would be impaired if, by preventing Mubarak from assisting his friend and ally Bin Saoud, and by stopping^ the importation of arras, w T e allowed Turkish influ ence to determine the supremacy of the Turkish nominee in Central Arabia. Their conclusions were that an Agent should be sent to Koweit, and that the arms trade there should not be interfered with. The proposal to send an officer as Political Agent to Koweit was approved by His Majesty’s Government, and the Government of India were informed accordingly on the 24th J une, 1904. It was decided at the same time to defer for the present any fresh measures for the prevention of the importation of arms at Koweit. Captain Knox, the officer appointed, proceeded to Koweit in August 1904. Towards the end of August 1904 the Turks, who had hitherto supported Bin Rashid, made overtures to Bin Saoud, and the latter applied to Sheikh Mubarak for advice as to how the Turkish advances should he met. Mubarak approached48 the Political Agent at Koweit on the subject in Captain Kura to October 1901, bat Captain Knox informed him October 17,1904. that he had no instructions to give advice, and that Bin Saoud should consult his own interests in the matter. On the 30th December, Mr. Brodrick’s 1901, Mr. Brodrick telegraphed to the Govern- i^cember 30, ment of India that “ His Majesty’s Government 1904. desire that it should be clearly understood that their interest and influence are to be confined strictly to coast-line of Eastern Arabia, and that nothing should be said or done to connect them even indirectly with warfare now in progress in interior. They agree that Knox should give no opinion on advice to be given by Mubarak to Bin Saoud, but should repeat to former warnings already given against entanglements in interior.” It may be added that in February Townley to 1905 a meeting took place at Koweit between Sheikh Mubarak, the Turkish Yali of Bussorah, 17 , 1905 . and Bin Saoud’s father, and Bin Saoud seems subsequently to have come to terms, for the time being, with the Turkish Government. Towards the end of 1905 Bin Saoud, whose successes in Nejd had continued unabated, paid a visit to El Katr and addressed letters to the Sheikhs of the Pirate Coast, announcing his intention of visiting their territories in the following spring. The most important of the Captain Trevor to Trucial Chiefs, the Sheikh of Abu Dthabi, con- j^™ meilt of ferred personally with the Sultan of Muscat October 29,1905. on the situation, both rulers regarding the prospect of Bin Saoud’s visit with considerable apprehension. The Government of India addressed the Government of Secretary of State on the subject in a despatch January n,^906. dated the 11th January, 1906, in which they pointed out “ how very serious to our prestige and influence the consequences might be if Bin Saoud should attack the Pirate Coast Chiefs or the Sultan of Muscat, or succeed in extending his influence over them, and how important it is that we should prevent, as far as lies in our power, such a contingency, especially now that the Wahabee Amir has recognized the suzerainty of the Sultan.” They accordingly proposed that inquiry should be made, either through Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit or through the Sultan of Muscat, as to Bin Saoud’s intentions, with a view to ascertaining “ whether he is prepared to stand by the engagement of his predecessors not to oppose or injure British subjects residing in his49 India Office to Foreign Office, * February 22,1906 Major Cox to Government of India, February 4, 1906. Sir N. &lt;) &lt; !&lt;tm&gt;r, March 20, lOOG. territories, and not to interfere with the Arab tribes in alliance with the British Government ” ; and that, failing a satisfactory assurance on his part, he should be warned that interference in those localities would be regarded as an un friendly act, and that “ suitable measures would be taken to frustrate it.” “ These measures,” the despatch concluded, “ might amount, in our opinion, to a more stringent embargo on the import of arms at Koweit and elsevhere on the Arabian coast of the Gulf, or even, in the case of an attack being imminent, to actual armed assistance from British ships to the Sheikhs threatened, as might be necessary.” In communicating this despatch to the Foreign Office, some doubt was expressed as to the practicability of the Government of India’s sug gestions, and it was suggested that no steps should be taken, “ in the absence of any urgent necessity caused by Wahabee action,” until Sir N. O’Conor had been consulted on the proposal to approach Bin Saoud otherwise than through the medium of the Turks. Meanwhile, on the 19th January, 1906, Captain Knox, the Political Agent at Koweit, had talked the matter over informally with Mubarak, and after inquiring as to the truth of the reports regarding Bin Saoud’s inten tions, gave the Sheikh a hint that any inter ference by the Wahabee Amir in the affairs of States in Treaty relation with us would not be likely to find favour with the British Govern ment. Mubarak replied that he regarded Bin Saoud’s plans as designed merely to extort money from the Sheikhs on the coast, and that he had himself written to Bin Saoud strongly advising him against persisting in any such attempt. Major Cox, in reporting this conversation to the Government of India, suggested that he should be authorized to inform all the Trucial Chiefs that the Government of India “ would not regard with complacency the intrigues of any of them with Bin Saoud.” The Government of India telegraphed on the 15th March, 1906, supporting Major Cox’s sug gestion, which was approved, with the concur rence of the Foreign Office, by Mr. Morley’s telegram dated the 9th April. As regards the warning to Bin Saoud con templated by the Government of India, the Foreign Office adopted the view's of Sir N. [1098] O J750 O’Conor, who had been consulted and had recommended in a despatch dated the 20th March, 1906, that any such warning should be conveyed direct to Bin Saoud, and not through the agency of the Sheikh of Koweit or the Sultan of Muscat. Sir N. O’Conor further suggested that Bin Saoud, in the event of his visiting the coast, should be met by a British vessel of war at one of the places which he proposed to visit, and told that no tampering with the engagements and Conventions of the Trucial Chiefs would be permitted. In conveying the decision of His Majesty’s Government to the Government of India, the Secretary of State wrote as follows in a despatch dated the 13th April, 1906 :— “ His Majesty’s Government accept the view that a warning to the Amir would be necessary if he were to carry out his reported intention. They consider, however, that it would be better that such warning should be conveyed to him only in the event of his appearing upon the coast, and that it should then be conveyed to him directly as proposed by Sir N. O’Conor.” Bin Saoud’s reply to Mubarak’s letter of advice was communicated to the Political Agent, Koweit, on the 25th February, 1906. Major Cox described it as a “ very courteous response.” The terms of Bin Saoud’s letter, as translated from the vernacular, are obscure, but his apparent object was to disclaim any intention of objectionable action. As a matter of fact, Bin Saoud did not visit the Pirate Coast. In April 1906 news was received of the defeat and death of Bin Rashid at the hands of his rival, Bin Saouu. On the 16th September, 1906, Major Cox again raised the question of entering into closer relations with the interior of Arabia. He drew attention to overtures that had been made by and on behalf of Bin Saoud with a view to the establishment of a closer connection between himself and the British Government, and recom mended that the opportunity should be taken to come to terms with the Wahabee Chief on the following grounds :— Mr. Motley's despatch, April 13, 1906. Major Cox to Goverument of India, April 5, 1906. Major Cox to Government of India, September 16, 1906. 1. That overtures had been made at various times by Bin Saoud himself, and by Sheikh51 Mr. Morley’s telegram, November 9,1906. Jasim-bin-Thani of Katr and Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit on Bin Saoud’s behalf, with a view to securing for the latter some measure of British protection, and that if we neglected these over tures Bin Saoud and his following might regard us with hostility. 2. That if a friendly understanding were to exist between the British Government and Bin Saoud, both the Sultan of Muscat and the Trucial Chiefs would be fortified by the know ledge that any attempt on the part of the Wahabee to make a descent upon Oman would involve a preliminary rupture between him and the British Government. 3. That if Bin Saoud were our friend he would be able to assist us in suppressing piracies in the northern part of the Gulf. 4. That such a friendly understanding would facilitate Major Cox’s dealings with the Trucial Chiefs and would render it possible for our officers to make occasional tours in the Nejd country. 5. That the Arabs of Central Arabia, apparently driven to desperation by Turkish interference, seemed disposed to make common cause to throw off the yoke, and were apparently trying to secure the support of the Sheikh of Koweit and even of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Kealizing, how ever, that they were not strong enough to stand alone, they saw the necessity of enlisting the support of a Christian Power, and if we did not respond they might approach some other Power. It may be explained that, in addition to the overtures of Sheikh Mubarak and Sheikh Jasim, the subject had also been broached by an emis sary of Bin Saoud himself, one Musaad-bin- Suweilim, who arrived at Bahrein in January 1906 and informed the British Agent there that Bin Saoud now felt himself strong enough to turn the Turks out of Hassa and Katif, and then wished to enter into Treaty relations with the British Government, allowing us, if we desired, to keep a Political Officer in Hassa or Katif in return for our protecting him from a sea attack by the Turks. Major Cox’s letter of the 16th September, 1906, was sent home for information in the ordinary course, without comment, in October 1906. On the 9th November Mr. Morley informed the Government of India bv telegram that “ His Majesty's Government maintain viewthat their interest and influence should be confined to coast.” “No steps,” the telegram added, “ should be taken to enter into relations with Nejd or to send Agents into interior without my previous sanction.” Bin Saoud lost little time in renewing his application. In October 1906 he sent a further message through Sheikh Jasim, in which his proposals were set forth in greater detail. This message, which was delivered by Sheikh Jasim to the interpreter of the British Political Agent, Bahrein, was thus reported by Captain Prideaux on the 17th November, 1906 :— “ The resources of Nejd are stated to have been strained to the utmost by the recent inter necine wars, and Bin Saoud considers that the oases of Hassa and Katif were always the most profitable possessions of his Wahabee ancestors He is anxious, therefore, to recover the two districts, and he proposes that a secret under standing should be arranged between the British Government and himself, under which he should be granted British protection from Turkish assaults at sea, in the event of his ever succeed ing in driving the Turks, unaided, out of his ancestral dominions. In return for this protec tion the Amir is willing to bind himself to certain agreements (probably similar to those of the Trucial Chiefs), and to accept a Political Officer to reside at his Court. The details of this secret Treaty he wishes to be settled or discussed at an interview which he is ready to give me, either in person or with his brother representing him, at some convenient rendezvous in the desert. Bin Saoud is determined to make an effort to obtain possession of Hassa and Katif, for without the additional revenue which he can derive from these tracts he admits that he is unable to control the tribes who menace the highways of commerce and pilgrimage. He proposes, therefore, in the first place, to apply to the Sultan for the Muta.sarrif-Uk (Governorship) of the districts, and to throw' off the Turkish yoke as soon as he considers the moment favour able after establishing himself. If his application is refused, he will invade the districts as soon as he is ready, and, having captured them, he will appeal openly to the British Government for protection. If he fails, he will never betray the secret understanding between himself and the Captain Prideaux to Major Cox, Movember 17, 1906.53 Major Cox to Government of India, November 24, 1906.

Possibly he will not make his attempt even for four or five years more.” In forwarding Captain Prideaux’s Report to the Government of India, Major Cox, in a letter dated the 24th November, 1906, urged the necessity of an “ authoritative ” reply being returned to the “ references made through the local officers by Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit and Sheikh Jasim of Katr on behalf of Bin Saoud— references which have in no way been courted, but which I cannot leave unanswered without incurring among the Chiefs concerned a reputa tion for personal negligence or discourtesy, which would be prejudicial to my work in other ways.” These papers w^ere sent home for information in the ordinary course by the Government of India without comment in January 1907. In a telegram dated the 9th February, 1907, the Government of India w^ere asked for an expression of their view r s as to the answ er to be returned to Sheikh Jasim. They replied as follows on the 15th February :— “ We are sending despatch reviewing situation in Eastern Arabia, and suggesting that answer be conveyed to Bin Saoud to the effect that British Government, wdiile anxious to maintain friendly relations with him so long as he com ports himself in a manner consonant with British interests and our engagements with Arab Sheikhs on coast, see no necessity at present for making him any formal promises of the protection w hich might even have effect of stimulating Turkish opposition to consolidation of his authority. Answer might be conveyed orally through Sheikh Jasim or such other agency as our Resident in the Persian Gulf may recommend.” The promised despatch was sent on the 21 st February, 1907. In it the Government of India reviewed the position of His Majesty’s Government in regard to Nejd affairs since 1904. They expressed the view' that matters w r ere rapidly approaching a crisis, which would compel us to make up our minds as to our policy towards Central Arabia. They considered the prospects of Turkey re-establishing her au thority in Eastern Arabia to be remote, and even contemplated the prospect of the Turks dis appearing altogether from the whole of Arabia south of Zobehr. At the same time they held [1098] P54 that the establishment of the Wahabee power would be a menace to our position at Koweit as well as on the Pirate Coast. In regard to the question immediately at issue, they recommended that a reply should he returned to Bin Saoud’s overtures in the terms set forth in their telegram of the 15th February. Sir N. O’Conor, w r ho was consulted, took the Sir N. O’Conor, view that it would be most unwise for His 1 ’ 1907 ‘ Majesty’s Government to entangle themselves with Bin Saoud or in any other way to interfere in the internal affairs of Arabia. The reply of His Majesty’s Government to the Mr. Morley to Government of India’s representations was con- ° f veyed in Mr. Morley’s despatch of the 3rd May, Ma 7 3 &gt; 1907 - 1907, in the following terms :— “ After carefully considering, in consultation with His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constanti nople, the views expressed by your Excellency’s Government as to the general situation in Central Arabia, His Majesty’s Government see no reason to modify the policy laid down in my predecessor’s telegram of the 30th Decem ber, 1904, and repeated in my telegram of the 9th November, 1900, that British interests and influence in those regions should be strictly confined to the coast; and thev apree with Sir N. O’Conor that it would be most unwise for them to entangle themselves with the Wahabee Amir or in any other way to interfere in the internal affairs of Arabia. “ The terms of the reply, wTiich in paragraph 11 of your letter you propose to return to Bin Saoud, appear to His Majesty’s Government to be open to objection, as implying an approval of the consolidation of the Wahabee power, and consequently a certain interference in Arabian affairs. No such communication should there fore be made. But if Major Cox finds it impossible to avoid giving some answer to those who have approached him on the Wahabee Amir’s behalf, he should inform them, as Bin Saoud’s proposals involve considerations which it is impossible for His Majesty’s Government to maintain, that no reply is to be expected.” So far as is known, Bin Saoud’s advances were not renewed during the year 1907.40 55 Foreign Office, Library No. 8799, Confidential. Colonel Felly’s Report of April 1863. (f.) Turkey and Koweit. Turkey. Ujair, in the district of El Katif, is the most southerly point to which, with the important exception of Koweit, His Majesty’s Government have recognized continuous Turkish influence. This influence was confirmed hy the expedition to Nejd in 1871, with the result that the Turks have remained established at El Katif and in the El Hasa district ever since. The administration is disorderly and, owing to the half-hearted co-operation of the local authorities, British naval officers have been repeatedly thwarted in their attempts to capture pirates, with whom this district is a favourite resort. The Arabian coast north of Katif, all the way to Koweit Bay, is without a single large settle ment. Mostly barren and in the hands of the predatory and warlike tribe of Bni Hajar, it is very uninteresting and entirely unproductive. North of Koweit, Turkish territory extends to the western shore of the Island of El Khizo, and includes bao, where there is a British telegraph office, on the River Shat-el-Arab. Much correspondence took place between 1887 and 1897 respecting the creation of fortified works at Eao, and Her Majesty’s Government * energetically opposed these works. A full state ment on the subject is contained in an India Office Memorandum dated the 21st June, 1897. Captain Smyth, who was sent on a special mission to the Persian Gulf in 1904, reported as follows:— “ Eao is not a fort in any sense of the word ; there are no fortifications and no guns.” Piracy on the Shat-el-Arab has formed a con tinual source of anxiety to the British authorities charged with the security of life and property on the Persian Gulf. Koweit. The family of the present Sheikh have ruled at Koweit for above 300 years. Originally the Sheikh’s progenitors dwelt in a small fort, called Moomgussur, situated at the head of the Khor56 Abdulla, near Bunder Zobeir. They were once the pirates of the north of the Persian Gulf, and were expelled from their former stronghold by the Bussorah authorities. They came down the Bubiyan Creek and settled on the southern shore of the “ Bay of Grane,” where they built a fort or “kote,” whence the name Kovveit is derived. Limits. The limits of Koweit have never been accu- India Office, rately, or, indeed, even approximately, defined. May 12, 1902, The claims of the Sheikh extend on the south as far as Musalamiya Bay, but the British Resident was of opinion that they could not be supported, and that this place was clearly within the sphere of Turkish influence. On the north they include Safwan, Um Kasr, and Subiya on the mainland, and the islands of Warba and Bubiyan. Much correspondence took place in 1902 in regard to the nature of these claims, owing to a forward move of the Turks, who erected a fort at Um Kasr, and established a military post at Ras-al-Geit on Bubiyan Island. As regards Safwan, it was considered doubtful India Office, whether the Sheikh's claims could be maintained, februar . y 5 &gt; 1902 - as they rested upon the shifting allegiance of migratory tribes. In a report on Um Kasr, Captain Smyth, who Sir N. O’Conor, made a special survey of the proposed trace of j^n/i's, 1904 . the Bagdad Railway in 1901, observes that he Sir N. O’Conor, learned on the spot that the old fort of Um Telegraphic Kasr is generally held to have been built by the March 16, 1902. grandfather of Sheikh Mubarek, and that it was * occasionally occupied during the spring months by Arabs from Koweit. Mr. Wratislaw, His Majesty’s Consul at Bussorah, stated that while it was highly desirable to secure control over U m Kasr, the Sheikh had only a very shadowy claim to it, and it had been uninhabited for many years. On the other hand, the Turks seemed to have little claim beyond that of actual occupation. “ His claim to Bubiyan Island,” Mr. AVratislaw continued, u is in my opinion good. Por some months every year regularly it is used as a fishing ground by Arabs acknowledging his authority, and by no others.” The claim to Subiya was supported by His Sir N. O’Conor. Majesty’s Government, and, with a view to Telegraphic, March 26, 1902.57 Government of India, Telegraphic, March 18, 1902. India Office, April 9, 1902. forestalling an apprehended advance of the Turks, it was occupied by the Sheikh of Koweit. It was pointed out by the Government of India that if Subiya were surrendered Kathama Bay would have to follow suit, and the Turks would then threaten Koweit town. Pailaka Island, in Koweit Bay, is indisputably within the jurisdiction of the Sheikh; it has been peopled by his subjects, the Avazem trihe^ ever since the occupation of Koweit 300 years ago. When Colonel Felly visited Koweit some fifty years ago he described it as “a clean, active town, with a broad and open main bazaar, and numerous solid stone dwelling-houses, con taining some 20,000 inhabitants, and attracting Arab and Persian merchants from all quarters by the equity of its rule and by the freedom of its trade Under the fostering care of a succession of common-sense Rulers, and by means of a policy wisely originated and syste matically pursued, an Arab band of pirates now appear as the masters of the thriving port, the refuge of the oppressed, and the peaceful, free home of all.” He recorded the following opinion on the prospects of the port of Koweit:— “ On the whole, and without endeavouring to change trade from any present channel, I would bear Koweit in mind as a convenient point for a telegraph station, for a coal depot, for the meeting of sea-going and river steamers and other craft, and as a possible future port of importance.” The present importance of Koweit is princi pally due to its suitability as a terminus for the Bagdad Railway.* Attention will be directed to this aspect of the question after the political status of Koweit and the relations of the Sheikh with His Majesty’s Government have been taken into consideration. In his Report on the tribes around the shores of the Persian Gulf, Colonel Felly classified Koweit among the “ territories nominally recog- * See also p. 08 respecting Khor Musa in Persia. [10981 Q58 nising the suzerainty of the Turkish Government, but practically independent under their own Chiefs,” and in a later paragraph he emphasizes the nominal character of the suzerainty. Colonel Pelly wrote as far back as 1863, but his definition of the status of Koweit expresses in a nutshell the attitude His Majesty’s Government have consistently adopted on the question. In July 1897 Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople was instructed that— “ Her Majesty’s Government have never admitted that Koweit is under the protection of the Turkish Government. But since it is practically under Turkish influence, it is doubtful whether we could deny the latter.” On the 23rd January, 1899, the Sheikh signed an Agreement (to be kept absolutely secret) pledging himself not only to cede no territory, but to receive no foreign Representative without British sanction. In return for this he was promised the good offices of Her Majesty’s Government, and a payment was made of 15,000 rupees from the Bushire Treasury. The conclusion of the Agreement, however, involved a serious question regarding the property of the Sheikh in Turkish territory. Aliens are by Turkish law precluded from holding landed pro perty, and it was feared that, if the Sheikh were suspected of having agreed to a British Protec torate, the Turkish authorities would attempt to dispossess Mubarek of his property near Pao. The hope was, therefore, held out that the British Government would &lt;£ do what they could ” to protect him and his brothers in the matter. In .1901, rumours of Turkish concentration threatening Koweit raised the larger diplomatic question. In July 1901 Sir F. Lascelles had had a con versation with Dr. Rosen, of the German Foreign Office, upon the prospects of the Anatolian Railway and the general situation. An expression used by his Excellency describ ing the Sheikh as “ technically a subject of the Sultan but enjoying a considerable amount of independence,” which on a previous occasion had passed without comment (see Sir F. Lascelles’ No. 156 of the 3 5th June, 1900), now drew from the German Representative an assertion that the Sheikh was merely a subject of the Sultan.” To Sir P. Currie, No. 307, July 17, 1897.

Lascelles, No. 306, August 29, 1901. It was therefore pointed out to Sir E. Lascelles that the German Government might take advan tage of his language to argue that the Sultan could dispose of the territory of. the Sheikh. The view that the Sheikh was simply a subject of the Sultan was one that Her Majesty’s Government were totally unable to accept, and his Excellency was instructed to use language of a more explicit character. Sir N. O’Conor was at the same time authorized to state, if occasion arose, that if Koweit were threatened, Her Majesty’s Government would use force to prevent attack. Important communications now took place at Constantinople and London. Considerable pressure was being exercised on the Ottoman Government by the German and Itussian Embassies, and, though a proposal of the Yali of Bussorah to use force against the Sheikh had been rejected by the Council of Ministers, Tewfik Pasha informed Sir N. O’Conor that Koweit was regarded as an integral part of the Ottoman Empire. A warning given by the Commander of the “ Perseus ” to the Captain of a Turkish corvette off Koweit that no troops w r ould be permitted to land was largely magnified in transmission, and occasioned further protests. Tewfik Pasha inquired on the 29th August whether Her Majesty’s Government intended to establish a Protectorate, and on the same day the German Embassy in London received a pressing instruction to state that a British Protectorate would be contrary to the Treaty of Berlin, and that, in view of her interest in Koweit as the future terminus of the Anatolian Bail way, Germany would he compelled to regard such a proceeding as an unfriendly act. The reply in each case was that His Majesty’s Government had no such intention. Sir N. O’Conor adding the reservation “ provided that Turkey did not force our hands by interfering with the Sheikh.” Subsequently, the German Ambassador called to say “ that if by threats of force His Majesty’s Government prevented the Sultan from landing troops at Koweit, they were refusing to recognize the Sultan’s authority with which they had stated (in a Memorandum communicated by the King to the German Emperor) that they did not desire to interfere in those parts, and that the German Government considered that Koweit formed unquestionably part of the territories belonging to the Sultan.”60 ' Telegrams were also communicated by tbe Turkish Ambassador protesting against tbe re ported intention to declare a British Protectorate and describing the Convention of 1899 (the teims of which bad leaked out) as without validity, but the Sultan had meanwhile been advised by the German Government to be satisfied with the assurances given to Count Metternich, and to ask for their repetition. On the 6th September, 1901, Sir N. O’Conor was sent for by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The assurances given by his Fxcellency on tliis occasion were considered by the Ottoman Government “of a nature to terminate the present controversy,” and Anthopoulo Pasha was instructed to ask for their confirmation. The following note was accordingly addressed to him:— « The Marquess of Lansdotcne to Anthopoulo Pasha. “ Foreign Office, “ Your Excellency, September 11,1901. “•j uave taken note with satisfaction of the telegram from the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, com municated by you on the 9th instant, in which his Excellency states that the Turkish Government will not send troops to Koweit, and will maiutain the status quo there, on condition that His Majesty’s Government will abstain from occupying that place or establisning a British Protectorate there. “I have pleasure in confirming the assurance w r hich has been given to his Excellency by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople that, provided the Turkish Government abstain from sending troops to Koweit and respect the status quo there, Ills Majest} s Government will not occupy that place or establish a British Protectorate over it. “ I am, &amp;c. (Signed) “ LANSDOWNE.” In a Secret telegram* dated the 7th September, 1901, Lord Lansdowne, while pointing out that “the situation requires very careful handling as our arrangement with the Sheikh is not very precise, and it was entered into without the knowledge or concurrence of the Porte,” instructed Sir A . O’Conor that “we cannot recede from our position, and if the Porte should insist on raising the question of their rights we ma,y have to convert into something much more precise tbe present indefinite understanding with the Sheikh.” In view, however, of the assurances recorded in the note quoted above, his Excellency did not communicate these instructions during 1901, and 1901.61 1901. To Sir F. Lascelles, Nos. 304 and 312, September 11 and 12, 1901. the controversy rested for the moment on the basis of a mutual maintenance of the status quo. The Turkish Ambassador expressed himseli well satisfied with this state of affairs (October 1), and on the same day Sir N. O’Conor was assured by the Minister for Foreign Affairs “ most posi tively that the Imperial Government had no intention whatsoever of occupying or attacking Koweit.” An understanding was arrived at that the two Governments were to co-operate in main taining the peace, Turkey endeavouring to re strain the Amir of Nejd, while Her Majesty’s Government would do what they could to dis courage the Sheikh from aggressive action, and Mubarek was told that the good offices of His Majesty’s Government would be ex tended to him only if he followed their advice On the 9th September, 1901, a further communication was made to Count Metternich. A Memorandum upon various subjects, includ ing Koweit, drawn up by Lord Lansdowne for the King’s personal use, and handed by His Majesty to the German Emperor at a recent meeting, had elicited a formal reply from the German Government which Count Metternieh had lately left at the Foreign Office. It was now explained to his Excellency that the Memorandum, which had been hastily prepared, was a purely informal and unofficial document. The statement which it contained respecting Koweit was a repetition of Sir N. O’Conor’s language in 1900, which was to the effect that Her Majesty’s Government had no desire to interfere with the Sultan’s authority as it exists in those parts. There could be no doubt that this authority was of a very limited description. The Sheikh be longed to a class of native Chiefs enjoying a large measure of practical independence with whom His Majesty’s Government found it necessary to have direct relations for the sake of the maintenance of tranquillity and the protection of British trade. Therefore, although ready to maintain the status (jW), His Majesty’s Government had been unable to acquiesce in attempts recently made by Turkey to impose on the Sheikh conditions from which he had hitherto been free. They had considered it a matter for direct and friendly discussion with the Porte, who now regarded the incident as closed, and Count Metternich was informed of the assurances exchanged. [1098] HLord Lansdowne subsequently said to Count Metternich that it was necessary to bear in mind that where minor Eastern States were concerned it was not unusual to find that they owed a divided allegiance to more than one Power. The German Memorandum states that Koweit has an importance for Germany merely as the proposed terminus of the Bagdad Railway, and gives an undertaking that the Manager of the Railway Company will be instructed to come to an understanding with the British Government when the time for purchasing land for a railway terminus and a landing-place at Koweit shall have come. Count Metternich afterwards con firmed this assurance in conversation with Lord Lansdowne, adding that the railway might be made five years or fifty years hence, or not at all, but that when it was made it was important for Germany to find a peaceful condition of things in that part of the Gulf. In consequence of a threatened attack by the Emir of Nejd and Turkish troops upon Koweit, the Commander of His Majesty’s ship “ Pomone,” at the request of the Sheikh, landed guns for the fort at Jehara, and made arrangements for the defence of the town. Instructions were given to him to desist from these preparations as soon as Koweit was no longer threatened. Representations on the subject were made by the Turkish Ambassador, who demanded the re-embarkation of the guns and the restoration of the status quo. He was informed, in reply, that His Majesty’s Government considered their proceedings to be justified so long as danger of attack existed; and subsequently he was told that the guns had been re-embarked. Early in 1902 the Turks departed from their engagements to maintain the status quo, and occupied posts at Um Kasr and Ras-al-Geit, the latter on Bubiyan Island, which is a place of strategic importance, as commanding the approaches to the Khor Abdulla. The Sheikh of Koweit regarded this as a disturbance of the status quo, and put forward claims of territorial jurisdiction to both places; and British war-ships were ordered to Koweit in January. The Government of India took a very serious view of the Turkish action which, it was surmised, was inspired by Germany. They pointed out that with the shores of the mainland and of Bubiyan Island in the hands of a single Power, 1901. To Sir F. Lascelles, No. 321, September 28, 1901. To Sir F.

O’Conor made repeated representations to the Ottoman Government, but they proved entirely futile in their effect, in so far as the withdrawal of the post on Bubiyan was concerned. As regards Um Kasr and Bubiyan Island, Sir N. O’Conor informed the Porte that the Turkish occupation could not be regarded as in any way prejudicing the Sheikh’s rights and authority over them. He intimated that, if the Ottoman Government proceeded to bring matters to a crisis, he would advise his Government not to allow further encroachment, and, if necessary, to prevent it by force. The Turkish advance to Subiya was arrested, probably owing to the presence of British war ships. In October 1902, the Government of India reported a request made by Sheikh Mubarak for the gift of two or three guns, presumably to be placed at Jehara for the protection of Koweit against iand attack. They proposed to give a refusal, but to intimate to him that His Majesty’s Government undertook to defend the Koweit district, provided he complied with the injunction already conveyed to him to observe his engage ment to His Majesty’s Government, and to follow' their advice. Lord Lansdow ne concurred in the proposed reply, on the understanding that the “ Koweit district ” should be clearly defined as the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name. A telegram to this effect was accord ingly sent to the Government of India. In reference to an Arab raid from Nejd, made with the cognizance of the Yali of Bussorah, pressure was brought upon the Porte to caution the Yali, and a warning given that His Majesty’s Government would not allow an attack upon K oweit. The importance of securing the withdraw al of the Turkish post from Ras-al-Geit, and of assert ing the Sheikh’s claim to Bubiyan, and if possible to Warba, was emphasized by an Inter- Departmental Committee in October 1907. After entirely concurring in the views of the Government of India:, the Committee continued:— * It has been suggested that the importance of Um Kasr and Warba Roads is minimized, because the approaches through the Khor Abdulla are becoming silted up. But this appears to rest merely on hearsay and inexpert information. [1098] S64 “ We therefore recommend, if diplomatic con siderations permit, that the Sheikh of Koweit should be invited to specify the nature of his claims to Warba Island, to which he is under stood frequently to have referred; and that the continued occupation of Bubiyan Island by a Turkish post, in derogation of the Sheikh’s terri torial • claims (which have been recognized and supported by His Majesty’s Government), should be neutralized by the establishment forthwith of a Koweiti post, with the countenance of His Majesty’s Government, on Warba Island, or, if that should prove undesirable, on the northern shore of Bubiyau Island. If practicable, we would even recommend the establishment of posts on both islands. “ We desire to emphasize the importance which we attach to the effective assertion of the Sheikh’s territorial claims to Bubiyan.” The Admiralty concurred in these recommen dations, and Sir E. Grey was of opinion that, while it would be desirable to assert any rights which the Sheikh might possess in respect of AVarba Island, his jurisdiction over Bubiyan should be resolutely supported by His Majesty’s Government on the grounds so forcibly stated by the Government of India. It was decided, in the first instance, to ascer tain the nature of the Sheikh’s claim to Warba, and this is now being done. On the 15th October, 1907, a Secret Agreement was signed with the Sheikh of Koweit, granting to His Majesty’s Government, for a yearly rental of 4,000/., a perpetual lease of a portion of the foreshore at Bunder Shweikh (near Koweit), which is held, on topographical and hydro- graphical considerations, to possess greater capa bilities as a railway terminus than any other place on the Persian Gulf. The Agreement includes rights of pre-emption in regard to Ras Kathama, Warba, and any territory over which the Sheikh may exercise jurisdiction. This Agreement, and the appointment in 1903 of a British Political Agent to reside at Koweit, have done much to strengthen our position. Further measures which may be considered advisable are the construction of a lighthouse on Failaka Island or on Kubbar Island (which is considered necessary for navigation purposes) and the erection of a wireless telegraphic Admiralty, November 9, 1907.

It might also be of service to trade if a bank were opened at Koweit. It should be observed that a delicate point in our relations with the Sheikh is the extent to which we can ignore the traffic in arms which nominally he has prohibited. (g.) Mohammerah. The town of Mohammerah is situated on the right bank of the Karun Biver, about a mile above the point where it flows into the Shat-el- Arab. The British India Steam Navigation Company’s steamers call weekly, lying at the confluence of the Karim with the Shat-el-Arab. There is considerable communication between Mohammerah and the interior of Persia, while a regular service of steamers is maintained with Ahwaz. Both Turkey and Persia have raised claims to the ownership of the town and surrounding territory of Mohammerah. The subject is ex haustively dealt with in a Memorandum, dated December, 1906, on the Turco-Persian frontier. Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah is the acknow ledged Head of a number of Arab tribes on the Karun and Shat-el-Arab. He has considerable armed forces, and as regards the Persian Govern ment, occupies the position of a semi-independent feudal Prince. He also exercises authority over certain Arab tribes in Turkey. Sheikh Khazal has in recent years undertaken the policing of the Karun in a more effective manner, mainly with a view to secure British good-will. In 1904 Major Burton, who acted as British Vice-Consul at Mohammerah, recommended that an Arrangement should be made with the Sheikh, guaranteeing him against the Persian Government. He stated that the Sheikh had extended his power in a very marked manner, and that his territory apparently stretched along the coast as far as Shah Abdul Shah, a few miles west of Dilani, whilst there were few signs of Persian authority south of Band-i-kir to the border of Pars. The Governors of Ahwaz and Mashur were nominated by him; he had done much for the suppression of piracy on the Shat- el-Arab and the safety of the roads and the Karun River in Arabistan ; while, if encouraged,66 • -- he would do more to please the British Govern ment, and might effectively block foreign schemes of irrigation within the limits of his jurisdiction. This proposal, though at first sight inviting, would prove difficult, if not impossible, in execu tion, on account of the admissions as to Persian sovereignty made by His Majesty’s Government in the course of the negotiations respecting the Turco-Persian frontier. in 1902 Sheikh Khazal, who for upwards of sixty years had farmed the Customs of Moham- merah, entered, with some reluctance, into an Arrangement with the Persian Government to place the administration of the customs under the Belgian Customs officials. At the same time, he pressed His Majesty’s Government for an assurance of support in the event of the Persian Government breaking their engagements towards him. While expressing himself able to deal with the Persians, he feared an attempt to coerce him might be made by some other Power, either acting alone or in co-operation with the Shah’s Government. His Majesty’s Government under took to protect Mohammerah against naval attack by a foreign Power under any pretext, and also, so long as the Sheikh remained faithful to the Shah and followed British advice, to continue to give him good offices and support. At a meeting held on the 22nd March, 1905, the Imperial Defence Committee decided :— “ That it is important to secure the good offices of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and the possibility of sup porting him in certain cases against the Shah should not be excluded; but we must be the judges of the merits of any dispute which may arise.” In December 1907, His Majesty’s Chargd dAffaires at Tehran reported that Messrs. Wonckhaus, the German firm, had leased a plot of land on the river bank at Mohammerah for a p&lt; riod of eight years. (h.) Persia. Most of the authoritative statements on the protection of our interests in Southern Persia and the Gulf have been rendered largely irrelevant by the conclusion of the Anglo-Bussian Conven tion ; while another factor, of perhaps correspond- iog import, is the rise of German influence at Tehran—too recent to admit any definition of its ultimate effect. Foreign Office Memorandum, December 11, 1905. Mr. Marling, No. 18, Commercial, December 21, 1907.•47 67 In these circumstances, it is peculiarly hard to write upon the situation as it is affected on the Persian littoral of the Gulf; existing information is largely beside the point; the future trend of events is remarkably obscured. It has accordingly seemed advisable, in consider ing here the Persian question in relation to the Gulf, to avoid larger and indefinite issues, and to direct attention exclusively, and that only on general lines, to (a) a description of the coast-line, and (b) the development of trade routes and rail way communication. The first subject could obviously not be omitted in a Memorandum of this character; the second is suggested by the declaration of the German Government, that their interest in Persia is purely commercial- Without seeking to impugn the sincerity of this limitation, it may he doubted whether, at the present day, a distinct line can be drawn between political and com mercial relations, tiie more so since in other quarters German policy has shown ouch onn- spicuous success in using the leverage of com mercial enterprise for the promotion of political ascendency. It has been justly said that Persia governs her coast on sufferance. Proverbially timorous of the sea, and possessed of a single vessel of war —the “ Persepolis ”—under foreign command and at present un seaworthy, the Persians owe their authority, such as it is, to the past exertions and actual presence of British naval officers, who have rendered navigation secure, and thus contributed in no small degree to the revenue ot the Persian exchequer. To show that this statement is not overdrawn, it may be recalltd that there is not a single really Persian village or town from Mohammerah, on the Shat-el-Arab, to Gwadur, on the Baluchistan border. Excepting Bushire, every town, village, and island is inhabited by Arabs, with a very small sprinkling of Persian blood among them, over whom the Persian Government would be incapable of asserting authority should any concerted rising take place. Only a few years ago there was a temporary overthrow of Persian authority at Lingah ; the Sheikh of Kishm would like to declare his independence; and for some time it was an open question whether the Arabs of Mohammerah would submit to the extension of the new customs regime to that port. Within the past six months there have been serious [1098] T68 disturbances at Lingah and Bunder Abbas, and British naval action has been taken against pirates at t)ayir on the Persian coast. The most striking feature of the Persian coast is the absence of good harbours. Bushire, Lingah and Bunder Abbas are merely open roadsteads, where a landing can sometimes be effected only with difficulty, and for days it may be impossible to work cargo. At Bushire cargo can indeed be brought alongside the customs-house in almost any weather, provided the lighters can approach the steamers, which remain at over 2 miles from the shore. The position could be immeasurably improved by dredging. At Bunder Abbas a good' harbour could be constructed by utilizing the deep water of the Clarence Straits, which separate the Island of Kishm from the mainland. The importance of Bunder Abbas, with the Position at Bunder Abbas, &amp;c. adjacent Islands of Kishm, Henjam, and Hormuz, as a naval station, was the subject of much official correspondenco between 1900 and 1905, and was cmpimsized by an Inter-Departmental Committee which met in October 1907. A point of the Persian coast which calls for Admiralty, . . i. • j. August 7, 1903. special mention on account of its suitability as a terminus for the Bagdad Bailway is Khor Musa, near the Shat-el-Arab. This Khor was surveyed by two British naval officers in 1903. Turning now to the subject of trade routes and the development of railway communication, the ports which command caravan routes are Bunder Abbas, Bushire, and Mohammerah, while Bussorah, in Turkish territory, is a principal artery for trade in transit to Persia via Bagdad and Kerman shah. The Bunder Abbas roads to Kerman and Yezd are very insecure on account of brigands, and the road from Bushire to Shiraz is arduous and difficult. The transport rates are subject to great fluctuation; but, striking an average, Mr. Whig- ham, in his book “ The Persian Problem,” points out that whereas it costs 30s. a ton to carry goods from London to Bushire, the transport thence to Shiraz (183 miles) costs 87s., and the charge from Bushire to Ispahan may be esti mated at 10Z. The Ahwaz-Ispahan road, constructed for the Bakhtiari Khans by Messrs. Lynch, has brought Ispahan within much closer proximity to the sea, and, in point of distance, is a great improve ment on the Bushire—Shiraz-Ispahan route.69 The opening of roads is indeed desirable in order to feed the trade of the Gulf; but it has been forcibly urged that no marked development of commerce can take place until railway con struction has been entered upon, and that a single line joining Bunder Abbas or Bushire with the plateau would be of incalculable service in this connection, since it would reduce the time of the journey from the coast to Ispahan from thirty days to twenty-four hours, and the cost of trans port from 10/. a ton to 1/. Moreover, it is by no means improbable—the German Minister for Foreign Affairs alluded to the contingency in conversation with Sir E. Grey — that the promoters of the Bagdad Railway may seek to secure an extension across the Turkish frontier, and the situation which now causes anxiety to His Majesty’s Government in Mesopotamia may perhaps find a counterpart in the south of Persia. That such a consummation would be prejudicial to our interests does not appear to require demonstration; and a Conces sion of this nature should assuredly be fore- Acquisition of prior rights for stalled by the acquisition of prior rights, to Railway Construction. which, in virtue of undertakings of the late Shah* and his predecessor, His Majesty’s Government are already in some degree entitled. The most natural route for a railway would perhaps be the prolongation of the Khanikin branch from Bagdad via Kermanshah, Sultana- bad and Ispahan to Yezd, with branches to Dizful and Mohammerah and to Kerman and Bunder Abbas. The provisions of the Anglo- Russian Convention would occasion some devia tion from this line, but the trunk line could be modified to meet the exigencies of the political situation, while a beginning would necessarily be made with the branches which rest on the sea. For the present, questions of actual construc tion are premature; it is only desirable, in order to guard against a needless surrender to German competition, to enter a caveat at Tehran. The following letter, dated the 25th September, 1907, contains the views of Sir E. Grey on the subject of railway construction :— “ I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to state, for the information of the Secretary o State for India, that he has recently had under consideration the effect which the signature of * See Appendix (B), p. 114.the Anglo-Russian Convention is likely to exercise, sooner or later, upon the question of railway construction in Persia. “ As you are aware, the Convention provides that neither of the Contracting Powers shall, without previous arrangement between them, oppose the grant of Concessions supported by the other within the limits of the neutral zone, where equality of commercial opportunity is likewise recognized to the subjects of third Powers. “ It may, indeed, safely be surmised that other Powers will not be slow to appreciate the changed situation, and to seek to turn it to advantage. “ Although, the Russo-Persian Railway Con vention has still some years to run, the question of future railway construction in Persia, and the pledges made to His Majesty’s Government by the two late Shahs must not be lost sight of, and a timely decision should be taken as to what Concessions it would be most conducive to the interests of British policy to obtain for railway construction in Southern Persia. “ In these circumstances, it seems advisable that His Majesty’s Government should take into early consideration the question of a possible attempt to extend the Bagdad Railway into Southern Persia, with a view to determining whether a Concession of this nature to other Powers should be opposed, or whether it should be forestalled by timely action on the part of His Majesty’s Government, who, by securing prior rights of construction, might render an extension of the Bagdad Railway under foreign auspices economi cally undesirable. “ Sir E. Grey is unwilling that the history of the Bagdad Railway Concession, which at one time could have been secured to British enter prise, should find a counterpart in Persia. Moreover, the extension of the Bagdad Railway, as a foreign undertaking, in the direction of the Indian frontier, would, on strategic grounds, appear to be inadmissible ; the grant of such a Concession would compel the opposition of His Majesty’s Government, and a sharp diplomatic conflict would ensue, whereas by the exercise of foresight such a crisis might be averted altogether. “ Turning now to the question of what specific action His Majesty’s Government should take to the end in view, it appears to Sir E. Grey that a British Concession for a railway from Bunder4 &lt;? 71 Abbas to Shiraz might prove financially advan tageous, while it would seem to offer no strategic objections from the point of view of the defence of India. Such a line would absorb all the traffic which has hitherto passed from Bushire and Ahwaz to the north of Persia, and would result in the material improvement of the port of Bunder Abbas, now in the British sphere, and greatly increase its value and importance. The Concession might include the right to continue the line to Ahwaz or elsewhere in Arabistan, and to effect a junction with the Bagdad Railway— such extension to be left to the discretion of the concessiofmaire. “ An alternative scheme, which deserves examination, is whether it would be either desirable or practicable to unite the Indian railway system with the Bagdad Railway. “This scheme raises strategic considerations which fall within the province of the Govern ment of India and the Committee of Imperial Defence. “ It may well be thought expedient, for strategic reasons, to oppose altogether the progress of railway construction towards the Indian frontier. Be this as it may, it would appear that the difficulty of meeting German competition in the neutral zone in Persia is likely to increase from year to year, and it may prove that a railway such as that referred to would, in British hands, be the most effective means of anticipating a German commercial advance into Southern Persia in the future, thus becoming the source of protection rather than of weakness in the defence of India. “ As to the economic aspects of the scheme, it may be regarded as likely that the existence of such a line would make British co-operation in the Bagdad Railway more welcome to the Germans, since it wmuld increase the volume of through traffic. While passengers would hesitate to travel by the Bagdad Railway with the necessity of breaking the journey on arrival at the Persian Gulf, the convenience of a through carriage from Calais to India could not fail to make itself felt; further, the economy of time would be considerable, and of especial value in the transmission of mails. “ The objections of the Russian Government might be such as to render the enterprise in advisable, though these objections could not [1098] C «72 fairly extend to the British ‘ sphere ’ of influence; but, in Sir E. Grey’s opinion, there is no reason to believe that they would prove insurmountable if on mature consideration the enterprise should be deemed advantageous. “ Sir E. Grey is of opinion that the whole question should be submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence, in order that His Majesty’s Government may be in a position to decide upon a definite line of policy “ The subject of British participation in the Bagdad Railway may possibly be raised on the occasion of the approaching visit of the German Emperor to this country; and, both on this account and for the reasons already explained, it is desirable that a decision on the questions raised should not be unduly delayed.” (i.) Bassidu. Bassidu is situated at the western extremity of Kishm Island, which lies parallel to the Persian Coast, from which it is separated by Clarence Strait. It has a good anchorage, for vessels of moderate draught, about a third of a mile off shore. For landing purposes there is a low stone pier, about 80 yards in length, extending to low-water mark. It was once a flourishing Portuguese Settle ment, and the ruins of the old town are still in existence. The British occupation appears to have begun in 1820, under a verbal grant from Sultan Syed Saeed of Muscat, who then exercised juris diction over the island. This was confirmed by India Office, ..... , C 3 u March 20, 1899. Agreement with his son and successor, Sultan Thoweymee, in 1864. In spite of the fact that Kishm had been taken in 1852 by Persia, and leased in 1855 to Muscat, the Persian Government took no exception to the British occupation of Bassidu, either when they leased Kishm to Muscat in 1845 [? 1855], when the lease was renewed in 1868, or when it was forcibly terminated in the latter year. The Government of India, in their despatch No 66 of the 2nd May, 1901, state :— Note. —The India Office letters of the 30th October, 1901, and the 7th January, 1902, deal with the limits of British jurisdiction at Bassidu. The India Office letter of the 10th July, 1901, deals with British Government buildings. The Admiralty letter of the 21st March, 1902, incloses a report on the Islands of Kishm and Hormuz.73 “ We already possess a plot of British territory at Bassidu on Kishm Island. . . . Your Lordship is aware of the conditions under which we hold possession of Bassidu. Though we no longer use the place as a coaling depot, we keep an agent there, who flies the British flag. . . . There are no independent local Chiefs with whom we could enter into relations. With the exception of the tract in our possession at Bassidu the islands are under Persian authority.” Again, the Government of India wrote, in their despatch No. 92 of the 29th May, 1902 :— “ The circumstances connected with the British occupation of Bassidu are already known to your Lordship. The settlement dates from 1820; but our occupation has for many years been indicated only by the presence of a native coal agent, who, however, has habitually flown the British flag.” The place was for many years (from 1823 till 1879) the head-quarters of the Indian Marine; and it is one of the healthiest places near the entrance to the Gulf. On the 6th May, 1903, the India Office stated that the Hussian Consul at Bushire had made inquiries as to the nature of the British position at Bassidu, and had been informed of the situation by the French Agent at Lingah. In the Admiralty letter of the 21st March, 1902, a report is inclosed from Rear-Admiral Bosanquet, in which he says:— “ Kishm is, in my opinion, the most important strategical position in the Persian Gulf, from a naval point of view, and its possession would be very important to us as a port for our mercantile marine and a coaling station for our ships 6f war.” On the 19th November, 1902, a Conference, consisting of delegates of the Foreign Office, India Office, War Office, and Admiralty, was held at the Foreign Office, and amongst other recommendations as to the methods in which the extension of British influence could be most successfully prosecuted, and to the best advantage for general purposes, it was advised that “ we should reassert our claims at Bassidu.” It does not appear that any very definite action has been taken in pursuance of this recommendation, though it is recorded in the Minutes of the Committee of Imperial Defence. 5o74 An Inter-Departmental Committee of delegates from the Foreign Office, India Office, and Admiralty, in submitting a report (dated October 1907) on the terminus of the Bagdad Railway, recommended incidentally that such steps as His Majesty’s Government might consider feasible should be taken to consolidate our position at the entrance to the Persian Gult, including Kishm. It has been suggested that the ruined buildings at Bassidu should be pulled down, and a small meteorological station under a British- Indian subject established. A dep6t for stores for the ships-of-war in the Gulf might also be created, and it is worth considering whether a wireless telegraphic apparatus should not be installed for convenience of communication. (j.) The Islands of Abu Musa, Tamb, and Sirri. Abu Musa and Tamb. In January 1903 Colonel Kemball, the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, reported that, in consequence of the short-sighted policy of the Belgian Customs officials, trade had to a large extent been diverted from the Persian port of Lingah, and local merchants were endeavouiing to arrange with the Bombay and Persian Naviga tion Company to make the Island of Abu Musa a port of call, apparently for the purpose of facilitating their pearl business. Colonel Kemball was apprehensive lest such a conjuncture should result in a territorial claim to this island being advanced by the Persian Government who, in 1888, had laid claim to and hoisted their flag on the adjacent Island of Sirri. Incidentally it may be mentioned that, writing on the 28th April, 1888, Colonel Ross, then British Resident, bad expressed a decided opinion that no valid claim to Abu Musa could be advanced by the Persian Government, while any attempt to assert their authority in a practical form would probably lead to disturbances. Colonel Kemball stated that the island un doubtedly belonged to the Jowasmi Sheikh of Shargah (one of the Trucial Chiefs under British jn-otection). In the winter it was usually visited by people from Khan and Shargah for purposes ot fishing and grazing.

May 4, 1901 these people were in the habit of migrating, and the sole inhabitants remaining were three men whose duty was to tend the date trees belonging to Sheikh Salem, the uncle of the Sheikh of Shargah. The Jowasmis did not fly a flag on the island, and Colonel Kemball submitted that it might be well to advise the Sheikh of Shargah to do so as a sign of ownership. This course was approved by the Government of India, and on the 30th April, 1903, Colonel Kemball reported that the Sheikh had issued orders accordingly. The Government of India at the same time instructed the Resident to furnish his observa tions on the expediency of advising the Sheikh of Ras-el-Kheimah to adopt a similar course in regard to the Island of Tamb, which apparently belonged to that section of the Jowasmis. (In 1888, on the occupation of Sirri, the Sheikh of Shargah had urged that the Persians should be prevented from pursuing a similar course at Tamb.) Colonel Kemball replied that the Persian Government had never asserted sovereignty over the island; that the Sheikh of Shargah, in his existing capacity as Ruler of Ras-el-Kheimah, claimed it as an appanage of the Jowasmis of the Arab Coast, urging that it was visited by his subjects on account of the good water supply and for purposes of grazing; that the Sheikh was in possession of documentary evidence, in the shape of three letters from two Arab Sheikhs of Lingah, admitting the claim of the Jowasmis of the Arab Coast as against that of the Jowasmis of Lingah; and, finally, that in one of these letters, written in 1877, the Sheikh of Liny;ah had conceded that the Persians had no property there, nor any right of interference, save with the consent of the Chief of Ras-el-Kheimah. The Government of India hereupon directed that the Chief of Shargah should be advised, as in the case of Abu Musa, to hoist his flag on the Island of Tamb. In April 1904 the Viceroy of India telegraphed that the Belgian officials in charge of the Persian Customs had placed guards on Abu Musa and Tamb, forcibly removed the Arab flags, erected new flagstatis, and hoisted the Persian flag in both islands. The Sheikh of Shargah, on hearing of this [1098] X70 encroachment, declared that he could not tolerate the action of the Persian authorities, and, in virtue of Treaty relations, appealed to His Majesty^ Government to take the necessary steps with a view to preventing such interference with his territory. Maior Cox, the British Resident, in commenting India Office, , J , , • c August 19, 1904. subsequently on the irresponsible action or tne Customs officials on this occasion, wrote as follows:— “ I would observe, in conclusion, that signs are not wanting to my mind to incline me to the belief that if we do not maintain a vigorous policy in connection with these islands in the Gulf, it will not be long before we are con fronted with difficulties in regard to the adjacent pearl fisheries, the preservation of which under the time-honoured conditions has always been one of the fundamental features of our policy in these waters.” The Government of India took a serious view of the incident, and proposed to dispatch a gun boat to the islands, with a representative of the Sheikh of Shargah on board, to haul down the Persian flag, reinstate the Jowasmi flag, and remove the guards to Persian territory. It was decided, however, in the first instance Sir A. Hardinge, . No. 61, Tele- to make representations to the Persian Govern- graphic, May 24, ment, and on the 24th May His Majesty’s Minister 1904 * reported that they had telegraphed orders to Bushire to remove the flags and guards from Abu Musa and Tamb, while reserving their right to discuss with His Majesty’s Government the respective claims to the island. The following is the text of a note addressed by His Majesty’s Minister to the Persian Govern ment on the 15th June, 1904 :— “ Your Excellency, Sir A. Hardinge, “I have had the honour to receive your note of N^i&gt; 4, June 15, yesterdaydate respecting Tamb and Abu Musa, and shall be happy to transmit to the Government of India any proofs with which you may favour me that the claims of the Persian Government to the ownership of these islands outweigh those of the Sheikh of Shargah. “ Your Excellency must, however, understand that I cannot agree to the suggestion, of which I hear for the first time, that this Trucial Chief should not be per mitted to replace his flag pulled down by the Persian Customs officials, and I would remind you in this con nection that we have not insisted upon the Persian77 51 India Office, September 20, 1904.

Government removing their flag from the Island of Sirri till the controversy between the two Governments as to the ownership of the island, which originated many years ago, has been reciprocally settled. The position would have been different if the Sheikh of Shargah had removed an existing Persian flag from Tamb and Abu Musa. What he did was to hoist his own flag upon the islands, which were not yet formally occupied by any other Government, and he has the right to fly it as the first occupant, till his lawful possession of these islands is disproved.” In June 1904 Major Cox entered into com munication with the Chief of Shargah, as Head Sheikh of the Jowasmi, respecting the rehoisting of the Jowasmi flags. Elagstaffs w ? ere erected on both islands and guards stationed there, and the Chiefs and inhabitants of the Pirate Coast were glad, and felt assured that the British Government would protect them against enemies and would maintain their honour, and the people highly praised the British Government. M. Naus, the Belgian Director of Customs, informed Sir A. Hardinge, in May 1904, that the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs had told him that the Persian claim to Tamb and Sirri was sound, but that to Abu Musa was more- doubtful. No further Persian claim to Tamh and Abu Musa has been reported since 1904. Sirri. In June 1904 the Government of India in structed the Besident in the Persian Gulf to forward a report on the actual situation at Sirri, which the Persian Government had occupied in 1888, as it might be convenient to reopen the question of the legality of the Persian occupa tion if the Persian Government should afford an opportunity by questioning the status of Abu Musa and Tamb. Major Cox reported that His Majesty’s Govern ment had never in any way admitted, or with drawn their original objections to, the claim of the Shah’s Government to the ownership of the island; while it was equally clear from the records of the Residency that the Jowasmi Arab Sheikhs of the Pirate Coast had never voluntarily dropped their claim to proprietary rights over Sirri anv more than over Abu Musa and Tamb.78 As late as 1895 the said Sheikhs had declared that, although the Chief of Shargah on their behalf had duly represented to the British Government that the ownership of the island was vested in him, as Chief of the Jowasmis, the British Government had refrained from moving in the matter, and that they themselves had consequently been unable to enforce their rights by their own unaided efforts. A full precis of the correspondence relating to the occupation of Sirri is contained in a letter, dated Bushire, the 19th August, 1888, from Colonel Boss to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran (vide Government of India Proceedings, Septem ber 1888, No. 104). Sir Arthur Hardinge, in commenting on the correspondence between Major Cox and the Government of India, deprecated raising the {Vide mpm case of Sirri, unless the Persian Government forced the question upon His Majesty’s Govern ment, since the latter were face to face with an occupation in which they had acquiesced for very many years, though they had not formally recognized it. He added that M. Naus had consented to strike out Sirri from the list of Customs ports enumerated in the “ B6glement Douanier.” Part III.—COMMERCE. (a.) The Pearl Fisheries. The pearl fisheries constitute so important a factor in the general policy of His Majesty’s Government in the Persian Gulf, that con siderable space is allotted to the consideration of this subject, and the three principal papers which bear upon it are quoted in extenso. These are— (I.) A despatch from the Government of India dated the 10th March, 1904 ; (II.) A Report submitted by the Law Officers of the Crown to Lord Lansdowne, dated the 11th February, 1905; and (III.) A despatch to the Viceroy from the Secretary of State for India, dated the 31st March, 1905. I. “ In the course of our recent examination of problems connected with the Persian Gulf, the79 0 question of the pearl fisheries that have so lon» existed there has come under our notice. Im portant questions, both of policy and inter national law, are involved; and although none of these has fortunately hitherto assumed an acute shape, it seems to us desirable that the matter should be considered now, in order that we may know how to act should any sudden or unexpected development occur. We therefore address you on the subject. “The approximate limits of the pearling grounds in the neighbourhood of the Arab littoral are indicated on the inclosed copy of a chart of the Gulf. In addition to those marked, there are also shoals in the neighbourhood of Kharak Island, and at other points along the Persian coast, which are regularly exploited, and frequently yield considerable returns. We are immediately concerned, however, only with those lying on the Arabian side of the Gulf. Along this coast lie the territories of the several TruciaJ Chiefs, the Peninsula of El Katr, the Island of Bahrein, the Turkish Province of El Hassa, and the domains of the Sheikh of Koweit. The pearl banks appear from time immemorial to have been open, without distinction, to the Arabs of the entire littoral; and though there are no definite inter-tribal limits, the external boundaries of the fisheries are well known. Intrusion is resented ; the principal Chiefs have in the past expressed the view that the fisheries are common property, and that no Chief has therefore the right to grant any Concession to outside parties; and, believing as they do that the shallower waters are dependent on the deeper for their supply of shells, their objections relate not only to interference on the shoals which are habitually fished by their dependents, hut also to the exploitation of the deeper waters beyond. “ His Majesty’s Government are aware of the close relations which exist between the Arabs of this coast and the Indian Government. Since 184S we have held from the Trucial Chiefs agreements to refrain from any breach of the peace at sea, and in 1892 the Sheikhs concluded fresh compacts, binding themselves not to enter into any Agreement or correspondence with any Power other than the British Government; not to consent, except with the permission of the British Government, to the residence within their territories of the Agent of any other State ; [1098J * Y S380 and not to cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give occupation of any portion of their territories, save to the British Government. In respect of El Katr, we have at present no formal Conven tions. We have declined, however, to recognize Turkish pretensions on the peninsula, and the leading Chief has on more than one occasion approached our officers in the Gulf with a request that he may be admitted to closer relations with the Indian Government. Bahrein has for long been, to all intents and purposes, a British Protectorate; while, in the case of Koweit, though the Turks have laid claim to certain ill-defined rights of sovereignty, we have always asserted that the Sheikh enjoys a large measure of practical independence, and His Majesty’s Government have promised him their good offices. The maintenance of the maritime peace in the Gulf is an object which, for more than a century past, we have steadily kept in view in all our dealings with the Arab tribes. To secure this object we have prohibited the use of armed boats by the Chiefs, and have taken upon ourselves the duty of policing ail these waters. A necessary corollary of this policy is that the Chiefs cannot themselves adopt forcible measures for the preservation of their monopoly in connection with the pearl fisheries. It is clear, therefore, that w r e on our part owe to them an obligation to defend their rights so far as they can reasonably he substantiated. This duty carries with it incidentally the advantage that, if our right to police the pearl banks is recognized, a large area of the Gulf becomes at once practically British waters. “ In the past we have on more than one occasion intervened to prevent the intrusion of foreigners. In 1863 a British steamer appeared in the Gulf with trained divers and scientific appliances, but the steps which were at once taken by the Resident, with the approval of the Bombay Government, sufficed to frustrate the attempted encroachment. In 1874, and again in 1890, Her Majesty’s Government, on the advice of the Government of India, declined to coun tenance proposals made by British Companies to exploit the fisheries. In 1894 support w^as refused to an application by a British subject to the Persian Government for pearling Concessions in the Gulf. In 1899, in connection with the alleged grant of certain privileges to two Euro peans by the Persian Government, the Mushir-5 4 81 (Cb ed-Do\\leb was informed by Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran that no contract could be recognized which would have the effect of inter fering with the rights exercised by Chiefs under British protection. In 1901 Sir Nicholas O’Conor, hearing of a project which was under the consideration of the Porte to tax the fisheries, acquainted Tewfik Pasha with the objections which Her late Majesty’s Govern ment saw to any action which would interfere with the prescriptive rights of our protected tribes. In 1902 our local officers declined to countenance the project of a British Indian subject, who proposed to obtain facilities for pearling in Abu Dhabi waters. Finally, in 1903, Colonel Kemball reported that tw r o Frenchmen, named Dumas and Castelin, had arrived in Bahrein with the intention of prospecting the pearl banks round that island. The Chief refused to entertain their proposals, and subse quently the strangers left the neighbourhood, one for Turkish Arabia, and the other for Europe, where it was believed that he intended to engage a professional diver. He has, however, not yet reappeared. In connection with the last-mentioned case, we have informed our Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that we entirely approve Sheikh Esa’s attitude, and that, in the event of either of these Frenchmen returning to Bahrein, the Chief should refuse to render assistance of any description; that any other Chief who may be similarly approached should return a similar response; and that the Government of India should at once be informed of any renewal of the project, or of any like attempt. We inclose, for your information, a copy of the recent correspondence on this subject. “We have thus succeeded hitherto in staving off outside interference We recognize, however, that our position in the matter is in certain re spects difficult, and that in the future the same success may not attend measures which in the past have sufficed to attain our object. The question involves considerations, firstly, of private, and, secondly, of international law. Our rights in restraining foreign interference are, it appears to us, at any rate commensurate with those of the Arab tribes concerned, since these have agreed to leave the protection of their interests in our hands; and the question which we may hereafter be called upon to answer,82 whether in defending a civil suit in a British Court, or in meeting an international claim, must be the same, namely, the extent of the rights and jurisdiction possessed by the Arab Chiefs, dhe chart which we inclose shows that the pearl banks extend to considerable distances trom the main land or from any island. Within the 3-mile limit it seems evident that no difficulty need be encountered, and that the rights over the pearl banks, and the jurisdiction required to assert those rights, are indisputable. Beyond this zone, however, the case is less clear. We understand that it has become an uncontested principle of modern international law that the sea, as a general rule, cannot be subjected to appropria tion. At the same time, we believe that it is admitted that portions of the sea may be affected by proprietary rights on the part of the States whose territories it adjoins, and that such rights have been more especially recognized in the case of fisheries, to which the inhabitants of a neigh bouring State have established a claim through immemorial exercise of the right of fishing. There can be no doubt that the rights of which they now claim the exclusive enjoyment have been exercised by the Arabs of these coasts from time immemorial; and we consider, therefore, that the fact of these fisheries being in part out side the limits of territorial waters need not necessarily constitute a conclusive bar to the claim. In the pearl fisheries of Ceylon we have a precedent for the exercise of jurisdiction beyond the 3-mile limit under the Colonial Act of 1811, which authorizes the seizure and condemnation of any boat found within the limits of, or hover ing near, the pearl banks extending from 6 to 21 miles from the coast; and it may be observed that, in the recent Behring Sea Arbitration, the United States of America cited the Ceylon pre cedent as justifying their exercise of possession in, and control over, seal fisheries beyond the zone of territorial waters as ordinarily recognized by international law. It is also worth noting that the above contention is supported by the authority of the Swiss publicist, Vattel, who in his “ Droits des Gens ” remarked, in discussing the question as far back as the eighteenth century, “ Qui doutera que les p£cheries de perles de Bahrein et de Ceylan ne puissent legitime- mt nt tomber en propriety ?” We believe, there fore, that our claim to exclude all foreign pearling vessels from the limits of the fisheries83 S5 at present worked by the tribes within our Pro tectorate might, if challenged, be defended with a reasonable chance of success. “ There remains, however, the case of foreign exploitation of deep waters outside the sphere in which we believe that it may be shown that immemorial usage and occupation have con ferred prescriptive rights. In this still wider area we doubt whether we possess claims in sup port of which we could appeal to any lav r or international practice, and we fear that possible detriment to the pearl banks in w r hich we hold prescriptive rights would furnish no valid ground for objecting to legitimate foreign enterprise outside the sphere of Arab occupation ; but by authorizing the Chiefs to abstain from all inter course wdtk such interlopers, and to utilize the pow r ers which they possess of interdicting the importation of foreign diving appliances, of refusing to lend any assistance in men, boats, or in any other form, or, if necessary in tho last resort, of removing any such foreigner from their territories, we might succeed in putting such serious impediments in the way of such enter prises as would discourage outsiders frcm engaging in them. “ The question is fortunately not one in which we are at present called upon to decide as to the exact nature of the rights or the precise limits of the jurisdiction which the several Chiefs possess, and which we, as the paramount Power, are bound to assert and maintain on their behall' ; but in view of the possibility of further attempts, whether by British Companies or by foreign capitalists, we think it advisable to be prepared in advance. We shall, therefore, be glad to know T whether His Majesty’s Government concur in the views above set forth, and to receive any instructions which it may be deemed advisable to issue for the guidance of our local officers in the event of renew r ed adventures of a more determined character.” II. “ We were honoured with your Lordship’s com mands, signified in Sir Eldon Gorst’s letter of the 19th October last transmitting to us the accompanying papers, relative to the question of the steps to be taken to prevent foreign inter- [1098] Z84 ference with the rights enjoyed by the tribes on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf in the pearl fisheries, and requesting us to favour your Lordship with our opinion— ‘*1. As to the legal rights of the tribes within, as also without, the 3-mile territorial limit. “ 2. As to the procedure to be followed in expelling interlopers, and dealing with their boats and fishing appliances. “We have taken the matter into our considera tion, and, in obedience to your Lordship’s com mands, have the honour to report— “ 1. That the tribes have a right to the exclusive use of the pearl fisheries within the 3-mile limit, and in any other waters which may justly be considered territorial. “ As regards the fisheries beyond territorial waters, we think that a distinction must be drawn between the banks where the tribes have practised pearl fishing and the deep waters in which no such fishery has been carried on by them. “ As regards Uie pearl banks, we think that, as a matter of international law, they are capable of being the property of the tribes to the exclusion of all nations. In addition to the passage cited from Vattel, reference may be made to Puffen- dorff’s Treatise * De jure Naturae et gentium,’ Book IV, chapter v, section 7, and to the recent work of Professor Westlake, ‘ International Law,’ Part I, chapter ix, at pp. 186 and 187, and the case of the protection of the Ceylon pearl banks is a striking illustration of the assertion of this right in practice. Whether such rights in fact exist with regard to these particular pearl banks in the Persian Gulf is a question the answer to which cannot be given with any certainty, as it depends on the evidence available of historical facts with reference to the enjoy ment of these fisheries by the tribes and the exclusion of others from them. As far as we can judge, upon the materials before us, we think that there are grounds for asserting the existence of such an exclusive right, and we do not think that in point of law the fact that the enjoyment was by the tribes in common would prevent the acquisition of the right in question. Having regard to the relations of His Majesty’s Govern ment with the tribes on the west shore of the Persian Gulf, we think that the existence of this85 exclusive right may be properly maintained on their behalf by His Majesty’s Government. “ With regard to the deep waters in which pearl fishing has not been carried on by the tribes, we think the case is different. There is here no defined area at the bottom of the sea over which the right of fishing has been exercised to the exclusion of other nations, as there is some ground for saying was the case with regard to the pearl banks. AVe cannot see that the right claimed by the tribes to exclude other nations from these deeper waters could be asserted with any reasonable chance of success. “ 2. Having regard to the importance of pro tecting the deeper Waters and to the fact that for the reasons above indicated it cannot be regarded as certain that the right, even to the pearl banks, could be established to the satisfac tion of any international Tribunal, we think that it would be preferable to discourage foreign interference by refusing supplies, &amp;e., as sug gested in the papers before us. If such measures prove inadequate it may be necessary, having obtained the authority of the Chiefs for this purpose, to compel the removal of vessels engaged in fishing on the pearl banks. Of course, measures of this kind must be taken with caution, as international complications might result from any precipitate action. It might also be practic able—whether it should be done or not is a matter of policy—to raise the question in a form suitable for decision by The Hague Tribunal. “ Fishing within the territorial waters may, of course, be prevented. # “ Generally. AVe desire to add that, having regard to the importance of the question to the tribes, and the fact that we cannot be certain of establishing the right claimed, it is probably desirable that the fishing by foreigners should, if possible, he indirectly stopped without raising the question internationally. “We have, &amp;c., (Signed) “ R. B. Finlay. “ Edward Carson.” III. “ On receipt of your Excellency’s letter of the 10th March, 1904, on the question of the pearl86 fisheries in the Persian Gulf, I entered into communication with the Foreign Office with a view to obtaining the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown upon the legal and international points raised by your Excellency’s Government. “ 2. I inclose herewith, for the information and guidance of the Government of India, a copy of the correspondence.* “ 3 . Your Excellency will see that the Law Officers of the Crown have no doubt as to the rights of the tribes in such waters as may justly be considered territorial. Outside territorial waters, they are inclined to hold that the exclu sive rights of the tribes might he maintained to hanks in regard to which their exclusive possession is capable of historical proof; but they consider that the point is not free from doubt. In regard to the deeper waters, they are of opinion that there would be no reasonable chance of asserting with success the right of the tribes to debar other nations from dredging. “ 4s. In these circumstances, I agree with the general conclusion at which the Law Officers of the Crown have arrived, viz., that it is not expedient to raise the question internationally by forcibly preventing vessels of foreign nationalities from fishing on the banks. The object in view may probably be attainable by indirect methods.” Summary. The .situation in regard to the pearl fisheries may be summarized as follows :— The Law Officers of the Crown have laid it down that outside territorial limits, in the deeper waters, there would be no reasonable chance, on grounds of international law, of asserting with success the right of the tribes to debar other nations from dredging. On the other hand, it is apprehended that dredging operations, if carried out on scientific principles, even in the deeper waters alone, would seriously endanger the success of the pearl fishing on the banks, in regard to which the tribes may estab lish exclusive rights. The conclusion formulated in 1905 was accord- imdv that foreign vessels should not forcibly be * Not printed.87 57 prevented from fishing on the banks, but that the object in view might probably be attainable by “ indirect methods,” i.e .:— “ By authorizing the Chiefs to abstain from all inter course with such interlopers, and to utilize the powers which they possess of interdicting the importation of foreign diving appliances, of refusing to lend any assistance in men, boats, or in any other form, or, if neces sary, in the last resort, of removing any such foreigner from their territories.” It can hardly be maintained that this solution is satisfactory; the pursuit of such a course, even if effective in its immediate object, might not improbably give rise in practice to a sharp diplomatic conflict, and result in the serious discomfiture of His Majesty’s Government, whose guiding principle of free trade in the Gulf would appear as of varying interpretation, while its assertion would clearly be sacrificed to meet the exigencies of a critical situation. With the rapid extension of German enter prise in these regions the pearl fisheries are not unlikely to receive considerable attention within the next few years, and it appears eminently desirable to determine whether a situation at present fraught with danger and uncertainty cannot he regularized in a manner likely to . cbnciliate conflicting interests. His Majesty’s Government are at present on the horns of a dilemma—on the one hand, they cannot prevent dredging operations by foreigners ; on the other, they are faced with the knowledge that such operations will render destitute a large number of Arabs, who in default of the pearl fisheries, must either starve or turn pirates (see p. 1:4). For the welfare and the tranquillity of these tribes His Majesty’s Government are by pres cription responsible; to secure these objects British lives and money have been sacrificed on a large scale; and to abandon now the policy of a century would he both misguided and pusillanimous. Safeguarding of the Pearl An alternative course would be to approach Fisheries. foreign Governments and to explain the pecu liarity of the situation ; the measures taken in the course of the last 100 years to suppress piracy and to maintain order; the interest of all who frequent the Gulf in the tranquillity of the tribes inhabiting the coasts; the complications [1098] 2 A88 to which the introduction of scientific appliances in the pearl fisheries would inevitably give rise; the justice and expediency of securing to the Arabs, under time-honoured conditions, the exclusive enjoyment of a necessary means of livelihood; and, finally, the prospect of estab lishing, in the island of Bahrein, a free mart where merchants of every nation could purchase on equal terms the pearls supplied by native enterprise.93 Commercial Development. loss of 1,000/. every voyage, a statement confirmed by the annual report of the Company in Ham burg, thus affording substance to the contention that the service rested upon State aid. It was expected that the earnings of the second year would fall short of those of the first, as British firms had been aroused by competition to increased activity. Statistics alone, however, hardly expressed the spirit of competition engendered by the visits of these steamers, for the monopoly of the service enjoyed by a single firm, Messrs. Wbnckhaus, in fostering their own commercial development, coupled with the keen interest taken in the success of the scheme by the German Govern ment, had aroused an antagonistic feeling amongst the important British firms in the Gulf ports. Uncertainty as to the ultimate aim of the new undertaking had kept the European mercantile communities in a state of somewhat nervous anticipation. Overtures by the Deutsche-Orient Bank of Hamburg to native British traders in Bunder Abbas, an ostentatious forward policy in Lingah, including the flying of the German flag over two native boats, the endeavour to inaugurate relations with the Arab coast, as well as financial operations in Bushire, and many rumours of other forms of enterprise had added to the per plexity with which the future of German identi fication with the politics and commerce of Persia was generally regarded. Certain points w r ere indicated in conclusion as deserving of attention, with a view to meeting the special forms of German competition:— 1. Reform in the local working of the Bank of Persia. 2. Lighterage from British steamers in British owned lighters. 3. Greater regularity in the sailings of British vessels from Persian waters. 4. Establishment of a British Company for transport over the great southern road. 5. More attention to export trade from Southern Persia via Bushire. 6. The forestalment of all German schemes of con cessions in the valley of the Kanin. 7. Close attention by those firms concerned to the tendencies ot German development in the Gulf. 8. The pushing of British sugar and Indian indigo. Action in regard to the first two points is being taken through the India Office and GoBoard of Trade respectively. The farther desi derata, excepting 4 and 6, might be dealt with by the Board of Trade. Point 4 would require careful consideration, and might perhaps be dis cussed with Messrs. Lynch. Point 6 is already likely to receive the attention of His Majesty s Legation, who have reported fully upon an irri gation project of a Dutch engineer on the Karun. It is incidentally recommended in Mr. Chick’s report that the Imperial Bank of Persia should open a branch at Bahrein. This course is open to objection, since it might lend colour to the contention that Bahrein is Persian territory. On this ground it would seem preferable to en courage the establishment of some bank not connected with Persia—say, the branch of a Bombay house. (c.) Lighthouses * ** f [Communicated by Mr. Lovat Fraser. ] The following notes are based on conversa tions with officers of the Navy and Indian Marine, and also with commanders of mail steamers of the British India Company ; further, with poli tical officers. There are at present no lights in the Gulf at all, except a very small one (a beacon) at the southern point of Koweit Harbour. There is a general consensus of opinion that a light is chiefly wanted on Has Musandim, at the entrance to the Gulf. For manifest political reasons, this is also desirable. Such a light might be placed—(a) on one of the Quoin Islands; (b) on Musandim Island, the actual point, sepa rated from the mainland; (c) on the mainland behind. All three places are lonely, the climate is bad, supplies would h ive to be brought from elsewhere, and perhaps there might at first be danger from the local tribesmen. The replies to these objections are that the location is not more lonely than the island lights in the Red Sea, the climate can hardly be worse than that, and sup- * See also page 21. f A Report on Lights in the Persian Grulf was drawn up in 1872 by the Consulting Engineer for Kurrachee Harbour.

I doubt the danger: steamers pass by daily, and there are our gun-boats. As to the relative sites, the Quoin Islands are low, and might be difficult of access. The Navy and Mercantile Marine favour Musandim Island; it would also be a little safer. On political grounds, the mainland is favoured. Mail steamers make Musandim at night going up; in the daytime coming dowm. No tramp steamer dares to approach Musandim at night. The nautical reasons why a light is very neces sary are that it is often very thick and foggy at the entrance to the Gulf, where the water is very deep, and vessels cannot run into soundings. Next, a light is badly needed on one of the islands between Lingah and Bushire. Alternative sites are (a) Ras A1 Mutaf, (b) Sheikh Shuaib, (c) Keis, (d) Farur. Taking first Farur, it is 465 feet high, with a peculiar outline, having a small peak in the middle. Sailors say they can make it out in the thickest weather. Sheikh Shuaib and Ras A1 Mutaf can generally be located by soundings. Opinion seems to be in favour of Keis, because it is a sufficient distance from Bushire, and because a good course can be shaped thence, up or down. Thirdly, a light is required on Kubbar Island, south of Koweit, for making Koweit Harbour. The little beacon on the mainland at Ras A1 Arz is very insufficient. All authorities, nautical and otherwise, are in favour of Kubbar Island, which is the property of the Sheikh of Koweit, and easily supplied. As to Bahrein, there is an outer buoy, but it is difficult to make. Sailors would like to see tins buoy replaced by a lightship. The landing is bad, and very shallow^ for a long distance. Captain Prideaux, the Political Agent, has worked out some sort of scheme by which it might be improved greatly at a moderate cost, I think by reclamation of part of the foreshore. This might be a cheap and useful method of creating addi tional interests. Bahrein trade is very promising, but better facilities are yreatly needed. I think it was here that the “ Viceroy of India ” was stuck on a rook for an hour or two, an incident which passed unrecorded. 2 C [1098]06 At the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab there is a buoy laid down by the British India Company, but it is difficult to pick up, almost impossible at night. It ought to be replaced by a lightship. At Bushire there should be a light by the telegraph station. Quite apart from political considerations, lights are badly needed in the Gulf. Navigation there is attended with great danger at night, especially since the speed of mail steamers has been accelerated. (d.) British Cables. [Communicated by the India Office.] General. In a despatch dated the 21st September, 1899, the Government of India wrote as follows:— “ During the last thirty years the maintenance of the submarine cables of the Indo-European Telegraph Department from Eao to Jask, and of the land-lines from that place to Karachi, has devolved upon the Indian Government, and has tended to increase an already preponderant in fluence over both the waters and the shores of this sea (i.e., the Persian Gulf).” The following are the dates on which the various lines between India and the head of the Persian Gulf were completed :— Mekran Coast land-line from Karachi to Gwadur* Cable from Gwadur to Fao, via Cape Musandim and Bushire ..

His Majesty the Sultan authorizes the establishment on Ottoman territory, at the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab, of a British telegraph office,9S with a staff, which shall not exceed in number fifty persons, placed under the exclusive orders of a British station-master, and which, as well as the apparatus and all the instruments requisite for working the submarine line, shall be at the expense of the British Government. “ IV. The aforesaid British office shall be located in the same building occupied by the Ottoman station at the mouth of the Shat-el- Arab, with a view to facilitate the combined operations of the common service. “The apparatus of the Ottoman service and that of the British service at that joint station shall be placed in separate compartments, but in close proximity to each other, and shall not be connected. “ The exchange of messages shall take place immediately on their receipt, the officers handing them to each other through a window, and the service of the British and Ottoman offices shall be permanent. The rent and cost of maintenance of the mixed telegraphic station shall be shared in equal proportions by the British and Ottoman Administrations. “ V. It is well understood that the active service of the British office on Ottoman territory shall be limited to the receipt and delivery by hand to the Ottoman office of the messages arriving from India by the submarine cable; to the transmission of those which are delivered to it by the Ottoman office; and, lastly, to the superintendence and maintenance of a safe and regular submarine communication between the mouth of the 8hat-el-Arab and India. “ The Direction-in-Ohief of the mixed station shall devolve on the Ottoman Administration, but without the right of interfering in the internal administration of the British office.” 2. Bushire .—As regards our cable stations in Persian territory, the leading document is the Agreement made with the Persian Government in December 1862 for the construction of a line of telegraph via Khanikin on the Turco-Persian frontier, through Tehran overland to Bushire, as an alternative to the line through furkey to Fao, and thence by cable via Bushire to India. It was decided at the time not to make formal application for landing rights on Persian territory for the cable down the Gulf; but an under standing was arrived at with the Persian99 u Government, in pursuance of which the Persian Minister of Poreign Affairs sent the following instructions to the Governor of Bushire on the ISth May, 1863 :— • “As you already know, hy desire of His Majesty the Shah, the Persian Government are about to construct a telegraph line from the frontier of Kermanshah to Bushire, and the English Govern 1 » . as they may feel disposed, are at liberty to join their telegraphic v/ires, which are to be brought by submarine line, to the Persian wires ; it is therefore necessary that they should have a telegraph station on the coast, and His Majesty has ordered that a station should be erected for this purpose at llesheer,* under the directions of the Prince Itizad-u-Sultaneh, w Inch is to be given to the British Government for an annual rent. In the meantime, as the English cable mav shortlv reacii Bushire, and on its * * arrival they may require a place at once in which to keep their stores and materials before the regular station is completed, you will now at once, after communicating with the Resident and ascertaining the exact spot where the cable will be landed, proceed to erect a building according to the accompanying plan given by the Prince in a suitable position, and get it in readiness, so that they may not suffer in convenience.” Jask .—Landing rights at Jask were held to be implied in Article II of the Anglo-Persian Con vention of the 2nd April, 1868, in which provision was made, in view' of the possibility of accident to the Gulf cable, for the “construction and efficient w orking of a line of telegraph between Gwadur and a point between Jask and Bunder Abbas.” Article II of this Convention contained the provision that “ the English Government w r ill pay annually to the Persian Government the sum of 3,000 tomans for leave to lay down the line of telegraph on these coasts and places which are under the sovereignty of Persia.” The possession of land for a cable station at Jask was, moreover, set forth in the “ Jask Agreement” of the 25th February, 1887, from which the following clause is quoted verbatim : — “ That the telegraph establishment, which is situated at a distance of 300 yards from the * Situated on the Bushire peninsula, some 6 miles south of the town (Curzon’s Persia,” vol. ii, p. 235). [1098] 2 1)100 point, take possession of 600 yards more to the north of the telegraph establishment, i.e., 400 yards from the present boundary fence, between which and the telegraph establishment is a distance of 200 yasds, making a total from the end of the promontory to the limits of 900 yards; at the end of these 900 yards a wire boundary will be drawn, and the Government of Jask shall have no right whatsoever on any account whatever to interfere in the interior of those limits.” The Agreement also contained the following clauses:— “ It is agreed that if any of the defendants of Jnsk, other than the true, positive, and salaried servants of the telegraph establishment, in order to take sanctuary or protection, penetrate within the limits, the telegraph officials shall have no right to protect them; on the contrary, they should place them without their boundary, and hand them over to the Government of Jask. ‘ ; Any merchant, native or foreign, who may have shops within the limits must pay the usual customs dues on that which he imports in order to trade, buy, or sell.” Chahbar .—British rights at Chahbar are pre sumably covered by Article II of the 1863 Convention, by which, in return for an annual payment, the British Government obtained “ leave to lay down the line of telegraph on these coasts and places which are under the sovereignty of Persia ” Henjam .—The telegraph station at Henjam was established in 1869, on the diversion of the cable from Cape Musandim ; it was abandoned in 1881 and reoccupied in April 1904. As regards the ownership of the island, it should be observed that in 1868, when the question of a telegraph station had arisen, Colonel Pelly reported that in his opinion Henjam was a possession of Muscat; but the Government of India of the day elected to proceed in their negotiations for a telegraph station on the assumption that the island belonged to Persia. The Concession granted to the British Government in 1868 was embodied in the fol low ing Minute by the Persian Minister of Foreign Affairs, dated the 29th March, 1868:—“With respect to permission for the cable telegraph station on the Island of Angaum (Henjam), the301 number of persons to be employed, and the extent of accommodation to be provided on the said island in accordance with the Memorandum dated the 14th March, and the plans forwarded to the Persian Foreign Office on the 28tii of the same month, after being approved by the British Mission, the Persian Ministers, in order to strengthen the friendly relations between the two Governments, will give permission and authority in the manner indicated, provided that the number of employes and extent of the buildings are not allowed at any time to exceed those explained in the Memorandum received from the British Legation.” When our telegraph station was re-established in 1904, in connection with the scheme for establishing telegraphic communication with Bunder Abbas, Sir A. Hardinge informed the Persian Government that “ there is no intention on the part of the Government of India to support any such claim (i.e., to Henjam) of the Chief of Debai [whose subjects the local Arabs claimed to be], or to repudiate the authority of the Persian Government.” The Persian Govern ment, however, chose to assert their authority by sending a Customs officer to the island, much to the resentment of the local Arabs. A con troversy arose with the Persian Government as to the limits to be assigned to our telegraph station and as to the position of a Persian Customs office on the island. The dispute still remains unsettled. Bunder Abbas .—As has already been stated, the Convention of the 2nd April, 1868, em powered the British Government to “ make arrangements with regard to the construction and efficient working of a line of telegraph between Gwadur and a point between .Task and Bunder Abbas.” The question of bringing Bunder Abbas into telegraphic connection with the outer world was definitely raised in 1901. In their despatch of the 21st January, 1904, Lord Curzon’s Government stated that when the Viceroy was at Bunder Abbas, during his visit to the Persian Gulf, “ he was earnestly pressed both by the local traders and also by the Salar i- Moazzam, Governor of the Gulf ports, to lend his assistance to the connection of Bunder Abbas by telegraph with the outer world and it was accordingly anticipated that the proposal would102 prove acceptable to the Persian Government. Difficulty was, however, encountered, and, in view of the obstructive attitude of the Persian Government, the cable was carried back to Henjam under the authority of the Concession of 186S. Subsequently, this reconnection with Henjam being a. fait accompli, an Agreement was signed on the 13th May, 1905, by Sir A. Hardinge and the Persian Minister for Foreign Atfairs for the con struction of “ a line of telegraph to connect the Indo-European telegraph station at Henjam with Bunder Abbas across Kishm.” The line was to belong to the Persian Government, but the Indo- European Telegraph Departments were “ to pro vide the engineers and materials necessary for the construction.” In the second paragraph of this Agreement it was provided that, “ as soon as the line is complete, and the cost of materials and charges of the engineers and telegraph ship have been paid, the line shall be handed over to the Persian Ministry of Telegraphs.” The charges to be incurred were not to exceed 75,000 rupees, the payment of which sum was guaranteed by the Persian Government. It should be added that the Persian Government has not yet paid back the cost of construction, and the line has, in consequence, not yet been handed over. The cable house at Bunder Abbas is in charge of an employe of the British Con sulate who receives an allowance from the Indo-European Telegraph Department, but the site of the proposed telegraph office has not yet been settled, the question, like that of the station on Henjam Island, having formed the subject of a prolonged controversy with the Persian Govern ment. Muscat .—The cable from Jask to Muscat was completed in 1901, in accordance with an Agreement concluded with the Sultan of Muscat in 1865, stipulating that “ the British Govern ment shall be at liberty to construct one or more telegraphic lines, and to erect telegraph stations in any portion of territory subject to the sovereignty of His Highness, both in Arabia and Mekran, which shall be most convenient to them.” The Sultan of Muscat also agreed to “ afford protection to the best of his ability to the lines of telegraph, the telegraph stations, and the persons employed in their construction and maintenance.”British Rights at former Telegraph Stations in the Gulf. Telegraph Island .—Telegraph Island, \*liich lies in Elphinstone Inlefc, off the Musandim promon tory, was occupied in 1864 “ without reference either to the Sultan of Muscat or to any other authority ” (Minute by Lord Curzon, dated the 6th October, 1902, forming an inclosure to the Government of India’s despatch of the 23rd October, 1902), for the purpose of erecting a station on the Gulf cable. The station was abandoned in 1869, when the cable was diverted from Musandim to Jask and Henjam. Since that date the island has not been occupied by us in any way. The question of our status on Telegraph Island, which appears to be little more than a rock, arose in 1904 in connection with the proposals for selecting naval bases in the Gulf, which were the outcome of Lord Curzon’s visit to those regions. On the 24th August, 1904, His Majesty’s Government sanctioned a proposal of the Govern ment of India to erect flagstaff's on three points at Cape Musandim, of wTiich the site of the old buildings on Telegraph Island w r as one. The flag- staffs were erected, but as a result of repre sentations by the Admiralty, it was subsequently decided that two out of the three should be abandoned. It w r as recognized that Telegraph Island, in view of its occupation from 1864-9, stood in a different position from the other sites selected, and the orders of His Majesty’s Govern ment conveyed in Mr. Brodrick’s telegram to the Viceroy, dated the 31st March, 1905, approved the maintenance of the flagstaff on Telegraph Island 'as a sign of the continuance of our occupation of the spot, which first took place in connection with the operations of the Eastern Telegraph Company.” In a despatch dated the 19th May, 1905, the Government of India w^ere requested to reconsider the question of main taining the flagstaff. They were informed that “ the opinion of His Majesty’s Government w ith regard to the flagstaff' on Telegraph Island was based on the conclusion,” formulated in the Government of India’s letter of the 23rd October, 1902, 'that the jurisdiction of the Sultan of Muscat over the Makhlab Isthmus and Musandim promontory was of so uncertain and ineffective a character that it Avould be opeu to His Majesty’s [1098] 2 E104 Government to ignore it;” recent local inquiries had materially affected this view of the Sultan’s position, and it was therefore requested that the Government of India “ will again take the question into consideration in the light of the further information now in your possession,” and would inform His Majesty’s Government of their conclusions. It may be added that, apart from Captain Lorimer’s “local inquiries,” which were alluded to in the despatch, the circum stances had been further modified, inasmuch as the British “ Counter-case” in The Hague Arbi tration regarding Muscat had admitted the sovereignty of the Sultan of Muscat in the Musandim promontory. On the 26th September, 1907, the Government of India recommended that no further action should be taken in the matter, beyond leaving the flagstaff on Telegraph Island where it is, and this proposal is now under the consideration of His Majesty’s Government. Part IV.—CONCLUSION. The political connection of England with the Persian Gulf may be said to begin with the defeat of the Portuguese at Hormuz. The Council at Surat came to an agreement with Shah Abbas, and dispatched a fleet consisting of five ships, which co-operated with the Persians in Mr. T. J. Bennett’s paper {verbatim extracts).

Their power had been rudely shaken by their expulsion from Gomhroon, the modern Bunder Abbas, which had become an important trading station on the main land op posite Hormuz; this was followed by their expul sion in 1622 from Hormuz itself. Prom this time the influence of the English was steadily consolidated. On condition that tiiey maintained two ships of war in the Gulf to safeguard navigation they were to receive half the customs of Bunder Abbas, and their goods were to be admitted duty free into that port. Their position was, indeed, so far from being an exclusive one, that a Erench and a Dutch factory were established there before the end of the reign of Shah Abbas, who died in 162S. But it is clear, nevertheless, that as time went on the English did acquire an exceptional status in the Gulf, and that at a very early period in the history of theEnglish connection with these waters there may he found the germ of the larger responsibility and influence which this country was afterwards to assume there. The Persians, who at all periods of their history abhorred and dreaded the sea, were glad to secure an undertaking from the East India Company at the time of the expulsion of tlie Portuguese from Hormuz, to maintain two ships in the Gulf to protect trade, and six years later the Surat Council went in excess of this stipulation in sending five vessels to revive and increase the trade with Persia, and carry on naval operations against the Portuguese. The rivalry of the Dutch soon became as em barrassing as that of the Portuguese had been. They sent eight ships to Bussorah, where the English had opened trade in 1635, and almost ruined the factory there; at Bunder Abbas they proved such bad neighbours that the Company were forced to remove the bulk of their property to Bussorah, and though the factory was retained until 1761, for the last century of its existence it was the seat of a very insignificant business. The closing of the establishment at Bunder Abhas was almost immediately followed by the opening of a factory at Bushire, which has since become the political and commercial head-quarters of the British in the Gulf. The Eirman of Karim Khan, under which the Bushire factory w r as established in 1763, v r as granted to one Price, as “ Governor-General for the English nation in the Gulf of Persia,” and to a certain Benjamin Jervis, Resident, in response to a demand for “ a grant of their ancient privileges in these kingdoms.” It con cedes not only an unbounded, but a virtually exclusive, liberty of trade to the English. A site for a factory, as w T ell as a garden and burial ground, was granted. The servants of the English were to be exempt from the local juris diction, and the English w^ere to hoist their own colours, as they had been allowed to do at Bunder Abbas, and to have twenty-one guns for saluting. Taken in connection with a new Firman, granted in 1788 by Karim Khan's nephew r , who expressed his desire that the English merchants should “ sleep in the cradle of security and confidence,” it shows that towards the end of the eighteenth century England had attained a position in the Gulf to which none of her competitors could lay claim.106 The service that Great Britain rendered to humanity by preserving the peace of the Gulf during the nineteenth century has already been indicated. It found formal embodiment in the maritime truce at first imposed upon the warring Chiefs on the coast in 1836, renewed from time to time, and made perpetual in 1853. In her etforts to put down the Slave Trade Great Britain had no help from any other Power. How extensive it was may be gathered from the fact that in the early thirties the annual imports of slaves into Kurrachee alone amounted to between 700 and 800. The work of policing the Gulf may be less arduous than it was in old days, but the spirit of piracy is latent, and a break in the continuity of British vigilance would he followed by a return of the old dis orders. The beneficial effects of our past policy in this regard are frequently seen in the manu mission at the Consulate of Muscat of slaves claiming their freedom under Sir Bartle Prere’s Treaty of 1873. *Tn one other noteworthy respect Great Britain has contributed in a very sub stantial degree to the peace of the Gulf and the countries adjacent — in the help which the British authorities, political and naval, have given in the repression of the Arms Traffic. The predominant position which Great Britain has gradually acquired, and the policy evolved from the rights and obligations upon which that predominant position rests, are forcibly demon strated in a series of official despatches and public statements included in the records of the past half century. Prom these a selection of three has been made, viz., an extract from a despatch from the Government of India, written in 1870 and entirely approved by the Duke of Argyll as Secretary of State for India; a declaration made by Lord Lansdowne in the House of Lords in 1903 ; and a despatch from Sir E. Grey to His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg!!, dated August 1907. I. “ Apart from the positive engagements which we have contracted with the Arab Chiefs, and from which it is neither possible nor desirable that we should recede, the present is not a time when we can encourage the revival of old and I he subject of * Quarantine is dealt with in a separate Memorandum.107 ‘7 unfounded claims such as those which Persia now puts torward [to Bahrein]. During the years of peace that have followed the establishment of our supremacy in the Persian Gulf, trade has enor mously increased, and the predatory Arabs have embarked in peaceful and mercantile pursuits on the faith of the security which our protectorate a (lords. British steamers now ply weekly from one end of the Gulf to the other, and our subjects have embarked large capital in the pearl fisheries on the coast and in the commerce of Mesopotamia, Persia, and Arabia. Every day the importance of the Gulf as a commercial highway between Europe and the East is increasing. Even if the political engagements which we have contracted admitted of such a course, and Persia were pos sessed of an adequate naval force, it would be almost impossible and certainly impolitic to com mit to her the guardianship of these vast and varied interests. Any indication on our part even of a desire to do so would probably be fol lowed by the decline of trade, the outbreak of hostilities, piracy, and plunder, and a return to the disorder and lawlessness which during the last half century we have so successfully re strained.” II. “ The noble Lord asked me for a statement of our policy with regard to the Persian Gulf. I think I can give him one in a few simple words. It seems to me that our policy should be directed, in tbe first place, to protect and promote British trade in those waters. In the next place, I do not think that he suggests, or that we should suggest, that those efforts should be directed towards the exclusion of the legiti mate trade of other Powers. In the third place —I say it without hesitation—we should regard -the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal. I say that in no minatory spirit, because, so far as I am aware, no proposals are on foot for the establishment of a foreign naval base in the Persian Gulf. I at least have heard of none; and I cannot help thinking that the noble Lord waxed almost unnecessarily warm at the idea of such a foreign intrusion, with which. [1098] 2 E108 so far as I am aware, we are not at present threatened. Well, the noble Lord then touched upon a series of points connected with our com mercial interests in the Gulf. It is impossible, to my mind, to dissociate our commercial and our political interests.” III. “ I have to-day authorized your Excellency b 7 telegraph to sign a Convention with the Russian Government containing Arrangements on the subject of Persia, Afghanistan, and Thibet. “ The Arrangement respecting Persia is limited to the regions of that country touching the respective frontiers of Great Britain and Russia in Asia, and the Persian Gulf is not part of those regions, and is only partly in Persian territory. It has not therefore been considered appropriate to introduce into the Convention a positive declaration respecting special interests possessed by Great Britain in the Gulf, the result of British action in those waters for more than a hundred years. “ His Majesty’s Government have reason to believe that this question will not give rise to difficulties between the two Governments should developments arise which make further discus sion affecting British interests in the Gulf necessary. Eor the Russian Government have in the course of the negotiations leading up to the conclusion of this Arrangement explicitly stated that they do not deny the special interests of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf—a state ment of which His Majesty’s Government have formally taken note. “ In order to make it quite clear that the present Arrangement is not intended to affect the position in the Gulf, and does not imply any change of policy respecting it on the part of Great Britain, His Majesty’s Government think it desirable to draw attention to previous declarations of British policy, and to reaffirm generally previous statements as to British interests in the Persian Gulf and the importance of maintaining them. “ His Majesty’s Government will continue to direct all their efforts to the preservation of the status quo in the Gulf and the maintenance of109 British trade; in doing so, they have no desire to exclude the legitimate trade of any other Power.” It is abundantly clear from the passages quoted that the vital issues involved in the maintenance of British predominance in the Persian Gulf are appreciated; but, none the less, the recent activity of the Germans in pushing their interests in these regions has been so marked that there is reason, under existing conditions, to fear a serious diminution of our influence—first commercial, but eventually political; and this process cannot but be accelerated if the Bagdad Railway is completed under German auspices alone. It would seem, accordingly, that the moment has arrived when a policy of construc tive action might advantageously be substituted for one which is defensive in character, and practically limited to a declaration, urbi et orbi, that His Majesty’s Government will resist by force any attempt to establish a fortified base in the Persian Gulf—a consummation which is scarcely likely to arise, and which, since the destruction of the Russian fleet and the conclu sion of the Anglo-Russian Convention, has passed outside the range of practical diplomacy. Lord Lansdowne’s declaration of May 1903 was made primarily as a warning to Russia, who was then suspected of harbouring designs upon Charbar. It was also intended, though this contingency was considered less likely to arise, to prevent the construction of a fortified terminus of the Bagdad Railway. It is, however, practically certain that the Germans will not stir up a hornet’s nest by doing precisely what His Majesty’s Government are publicly pledged to resist. A policy of gradual commercial absorption has far more to commend it, while, on the other hand, it cannot give rise to legitimate protests on the part of His Majesty’s Govern ment. But the whole history of the Persian Gulf, whether in the time of the Portuguese, the Dutch, or the English, has shown that com mercial prosperity inevitably leads to political hegemony, and in these circumstances it is matter for grave consideration whether, on political grounds, exceptional measures should not be taken to facilitate British enterprise in the Persian Gulf, and to neutralize the efforts being made to undermine our existing position.110 It is to draw attention to these measures that the present Memorandum has been drawn up, and, even if the precise proposals which have been indicated do not meet with approval, it may confidently be said that some change of policy will be called for to meet the exigencies of an altered situation, and that opportunities should be seized or created in order to consolidate our position, and to turn to advantage by timely action the few years which may remain before the advent of the Bagdad Railway. Foreign Office, February 12, 1908.APPENDIX (A). (By Mr. E. Parkes.) (1.) British Declarations to the Persian Government respecting their Claim to Sovereignty over Bahrein. IN J8‘22 a Convention was concluded between Captain Bruce, then Resident of the East India Company in the Persian Gulf, and the Vizier of the Prince Governor of Ears, admitting the right of Persia to Bahrein. This Convention was never ratified, but, on the contrary, the arrangement was entirely disavowed by the Government of Bombay, who, as a public mark of their disapprobation, removed Captain Bruce from his post. 2. The India Office have stated that, in 1825, the Persians laid claim to the sovereignty of Bahrein, and that the British Government refused to recognize the claim. 3. Sheikh Abdulla of Bahrein was, in consequence of family dissensions, driven out of the island, and sought to enlist the sympathy of Persia. It was reported to Her Majesty’s Government, in 1844, that the Persian Government intended to take part in the disputes. The Persian Prime Minister was consequently informed that, unless Persia could show a clear and indisputable right to the sovereignty of Bahrein, she must be prepared to encounter, in any scheme of the kind, the active opposition ot the British Government. To support further representations, arguments were supplied to Colonel Sheil showing generally the grounds on which Her Majesty’s Government were unable to recognize as valid the claims advanced by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein. 4. In February 1848, the Persian Government objected to British interference in the affairs of Bahrein, but were informed that the British Government could not recognize as valid the claims advanced by Persia to the sovereignty of the island. 5. An understanding was arrived ait, in 18B1, between the Government of India and the India and Foreign Offices, that Bahrein should be regarded as independent and as subject neither to Turkey nor Persia. Subsequently a Treaty was concluded with the Sheikh (as an independent Ruler) for the suppression of piracy, and Her Majesty’s Government refused to concur in a proposal made by the Shah that the sovereignty of Bahrein should be transferred to the Persian Crown. 6. In 1862 the Persian Envoy at Paris complained of the seizure, by British authorities, of a vessel belonging to the Sheikh of Bahrein. Lord Cowley informed him that Her Majesty’s Government could not recognize any claim on the part of Persia to question their proceedings in regard to Bahrein. 7. In reply to a complaint made respecting the proceedings at Bahrein of the British Resident, the Persian Minister in London was informed, on the 5th March, 1869, that the Sheikh of Bahrein was an independent Chief, with whom the British Government had Treaty engagements, and whom they must hold strictly to the performance of those engagements. 8. In the course of negotiations relative to the status ot Bahreinese in Persia, the British Charge d’Affaires was instructed, in February 1906, to inform the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government had never admitted ownership or sovereignty of Persia over Bahrein, and such a claim was wholly inadmissible. He was further to state that His Majesty’s Government considered the island and its inhabitants to be under British protection, and must decline to entertain any further representations on the subject. 9. In 1907 the Persian claim to the sovereignty ot Bahrein was again urged, on the ground that it had been acknowledged in the Agreement made in 1822 by Captain Bruce. The British Minister at Tehran reminded the Persian Grand A izier that this Treaty had been expressly disavowed by the British Government, and that Captain Bruce had been recalled. Sir C. Spring-Rice added, in a later note to the Grand \ izier, that the Shah himself had refused to recognize the stipulations of the Treaty, which had never been ratified. 2 G 1822. Mr. E.

British Declarations to the Ottoman Government respecting their Claim to Sovereignty over Bahrein. In 1839, on the occasion of the irruption of the Egyptian Army into Nejd, the British Resident in the Persian Gulf informed the agent of the Egyptian Commander that the British Government could not admit any claim of the Pasha (i.e., Kgypt and Turkey) upon Bahrein. 2. * In 1&lt;S5I the Sheikh of Bahrein was reported to be desirous of placing himself under Turkish protection. Sir Stratford Canning was thereupon instructed to inform the Turkish Ministers that Her Majesty’s Government could not acknowledge nor acquiesce in any such arrangement, seeing that the Government of British India had had relations with Bahrein as an independent State, and had concluded with it certain Treaties. He was, moreover, to inform them that tne British Government must object to any arrangement which would transfer Bahrein to the dominion or protectorship of any other Power. 3. In January 1870, the Turkish Ambassador in London communicated to the Foreign Office a telegram irom the Porte, asking for an explanation of the proceedings at Bahrein of the British Resident. In this telegram Bahrein was referred to in the following terms: “ L’lle de Bahrein n’ayant jamais cesse, que nous sachions, de faire partie des possessions Ottomanes.” Upon this, the British Ambassador at Constanti nople was instructed “to explain courteously to the Porte that the British Government could not recognize its claim to the sovereignty of Bahrein, with regard to which a similar decision was pronounced by Lord Palmerston in his despatch of the 12th February, 1851.” 4. In 1874, in reference to a claim made by the Porte to enforce conscription against natives of Bahrein resident in Bussorah, the Turkish Ambassador was referred to the communications of 1851 and 1870, distinctly stating that Her Majesty’s Govern ment did not admit the claim ot Turkey to consider Bahrein as a part of the Ottoman dominions, and that, if natives of that island applied to British Consuls in Turkey for protection, the latter could not refuse their good offices on behalf of such persons. 5. In 1874 a piratical attack was made upon Bahrein by the Beni Hajir tribe, instigated by Nazir-bin-Mobarik and other Bahrein exiles, who signed a Petition claiming the protection of the Turkish Government. A Memorandum on this subject was handed to the Porte by the British Ambassador, in which it was stated that the British Government could not recognize any rights or pretensions of the Porte over the island. 6. At the end of 1875 the British Ambassador at Constantinople spoke to the Turkish Minister, Safvet Bey, about the supposed intention of the Porte to cause a lighthouse to be erected at Bahrein, and pointed out to him that Her Majesty’s Government would not all^w the independence of Bahrein to be interfered with from any quarter, and that any ciaim on the part of the Porte to sovereignty over Bahrein would not be acquiesced in by them. 7. In 1878 steps were taken by the Governor ot Bussorah to enforce the claims of El Katr merchants against Bahreinese. Sir H. Elliot addressed a note to the Turkish Government on the subject, reminding them of the determination of Her Majesty’s Government to protect Bahrein against any attack upon its independence. 8. In 1879 the British Ambassador made representations to the Porte respecting the imposition, by the Turkish authorities at Bussorah, of double taxes on vessels arriving from Bahrein and Muscat on the ground that those places were Turkish ports. He reminded the Porte that His Majesty’s Government had never recognized the ports as belonging to Turkey, and protested against the assumption that they were Turkish ports. 9. The Turkish claim to jurisdiction over Bahrein was renewed in 1888, and the Ottoman Government were consequently informed that any attempt to effect a landing at Bahrein would be opposed by force. They were also informed that any claim of the Porte to jurisdiction over the Chief of Bahrein could not be admitted, as Her Majesty’s Government regarded him as an independent Ruler, with whom they were in Treaty relations. 10. A question arose in 1892 of the British protection of Bahreinese at Bussorah. Acting upon instructions, the British Ambassador at Constantinople addressed a note to the Porte, stating that, as Bahrein was under the protection of Her Majesty the Queen of England, no interference by the Ottoman authorities with natives of th^t island could be admitted. 11. In the same year (1892) a landing of Turkish troops in the island was appre hended, and the Porte was accordingly informed that such action would be opposed by British ships of war. 12. A further communication was made to the Porte in 1893 on the subject of British protection of Bahreinese. This pointed out that the refusal of Her Majesty’s Government to recognize the sovereignty of the Sultan over the island had been consistent and undoubted. It went on to say that, having regard to the engagements towards the Chief of Bahrein undertaken by Her Majesty’s Government, they must continue to maintain the right of their Diplomatic and Consular Officers in the OttomanII 113 Empire to give their good offices to any native of Bahrein who might have occasion to apply to them in respect of their dealings with Turkish authorities. The British Ambassador, speaking subsequently to the Grand Vizier on the same subject, stated that, by virtue of the Convention of 1861, the Sheikh of Bahrein must be regarded as entirely independent of Turkish sovereignty. In a further despatch. Sir Clare Ford reported that he had informed the Grand Vizier that the claim of the Porte to treat Bahreinese as Turkish subjects when in Ottoman territory was inadmissible by Her Majesty’s Government, who would extend their protection to natives of Bahrein whenever occasion called for it. 13. It being the reported intention of the Al-bin-Ali tribe to form a settlement at Zobara, wit h the support of the Turkish Mutessarif of Hasa, the British Ambassador at Constantinople was instructed, in May 1895, to inform the Porte that the formation of such a settlement would constitute a menace to Bahrein. He was also instructed to state that, if the project were proceeded with, the Government of India would be compelled to take measures for the protection of the Chief of that island. Later in the year, in the course of a further remonstrance addressed to the Porte respecting the action of Turkish officials on the El Katr coast, the statement was reiterated that all Turkish claims to Bahrein, which was under the protection of Her Majesty the Queen of England, were totally inadmissible. A Memorandum on this subject was communicated to the Turkish Ambassador on the 23rd August, 1895. It was stated therein that Her Majesty’s Government did not admit that this part of the coast was under Turkish jurisdiction, but that Bahrein was under British protection, and Her Majesty’s Government could not allow any interference with or attack upon it. In a further Memorandum, communicated to the Turkish Ambassador in the following year, it was re-stated that Bahrein was under British protection, and that the Turkish claim to jurisdiction over that portion of the coast of the Persian Gulf in which Zobara was situated could not be admitted. 14. In February 1896 a note verbale was addressed to the Porte by the British Ambassador, requesting the issue of instructions to the Vali of Bussorah to admit the right of the British Consul to intervene on behalf of Bahrein subjects. The note reminded the Porte that the Chief of Bahrein was under the protection of the Queen of England, and it was, therefore, quite inadmissible that the natives of Bahrein should, when on Ottoman territory,, be treated as Turkish subjects. 15. Attention was called by the Porte in 1905 to the measures taken against Bahreinese for the ill-treatment of a German subject. Lord Lansdowne informed the Turkish Ambassador, in reply to his representations on the subject, that it was a matter ot common knowledge, and well known to the Turkish Government, that His Majesty’s Government had direct relations with the Sheikh of Bahrein, and that the island and its natives were under British protection. He went on to say that His Majesty’s Government were within their rights in taking measures to obtain redress for the outrage committed there. This statement was repeated later in the year to the Turkish Ambassador, when he was informed that His Majesty’s Government must decline to entertain any further representations from the Turkish Government on the subject. (3.) Turkish Declarations. At an interview, on the 25th April, 1871, between M. Pisani (chief Dragoman to the British Embassy) and the Grand Vizier (Aali Pasha), in reference to a contemplated Turkish Expedition to Nejd, Aali Pasha said the British Ambassador might give the most positive assurances to Her Majesty’s Government that the Porte entertained no intention whatever of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrein. On the 10th December, 1871, an assurance was given, in reference to the Nejd Expedition, by Server Pasha, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, to M. Pisani (first Dragoman of the British Embassy), to the effect that the Sublime Porte had no intention of attacking or obtaining any supremacy over the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf.

Persian Undertakmgs respecting British Railway Construction in Persia. BY the Russo-Persian Agreement of the 11th November, 1890, the Persian Government engaged that no railways should be constructed in Persia for ten years, on the termination of which period “ the renewal of the Arrangement shall be immediately discussed between the two parties.” The term of this engagement is understood to have been since prolonged up to 1910, but the Persian Grand Vizier informed the British Charge d’Affaires in 1902 that he had intimated to Count Lamsdorff that “ Persia would not agree to a further renewal of the Railway Agreement with Russia, which would terminate in 1910.” On the 16th September, 1888, the then Shah (Nasir-ud-din), in an autograph rescript to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, gave assurances as to British preferential rights in regard to railway construction in Southern Persia in the following terms:— “ Convey these commands to his Excellency the [British] Minister Plenipotentiary. Even give him this very autograph in order that he may keep it and be satisfied that our former promise with regard to the priority of the English Government over others in the construction of a southern railway to Tehran continues to hold good; and certainly, whenever Railway Concessions in the north, &amp;c., are given to others immediately a Concession for a railway from Tehran to Shuster or such a one will be given to the English Company; and, of course, then the clauses and conditions will also be examined in order that it be to our advantage and interest and for the benefit of the commerce of both parties; and positively no southern railway without consultation with the English Government will be granted to any foreign country. “ P.S.—And it is clear that in Persia nobody will be granted permission to construct railways, except it be solely commercial ones. We say so now that they may know it.” On the 4th April, 1900, the British Charge d’Affaires at Tehran was instructed to remind the Persian Government of this engagement, and to “make sure that the Shah, i.e., Nasir-ud-din’s successor, the late Muzaffar-ud-din Shah,” was aware of its “ existence.” Mr. Spring-Rice accordingly communicated a copy of the rescript of 1888 in an official note to the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, requesting that it might be laid before the Shah. Both the Grand Vizier, to whom a second copy of the communication was given; and the Minister of Foreign Affairs promised that this should be done at once, and Mr. Spring-Rice subsequently learnt from the Shah’s doctor that the matter had been explained to His Majesty, and that the latter had seen the document. On the 11th April, 1900, the British Charge d’Affaires, at a farewell interview with the Shah, who was about to start for Europe, thought it best not to mention the subject; but, on withdrawing, he was informed orally by the Grand Vizier that the rescript had been laid before the Shah, “ who regarded it as of binding force.” The Grand Vizier added that for the next ten years the question of concessions would not arise owing to the Russian Railway Agreement, but that if the Russians raised it, the Shah would produce his father’s promise to Great Britain. The Minister for Foreign Affairs told Mr. Spring-Rice that this was the answer to his official note. The Government of India, on the 2nd September, 1907, raised the question of whether the pledges given in 1888 were affected by the recently concluded Anglo-Russian Agreement. This question appears to be still under the consideration of His Majesty’s Government.I 115 APPENDIX (C). ^ BIBLIOGRAPHY.
