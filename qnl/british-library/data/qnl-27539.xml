I discussed the matter with Captain Creagh and agree with his views. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Government of India and to His 'M-aj esty' 3 Minister at Tehran.

'Shorehsan', at Bushire# 27th January 1934# Sir, I hare the honour to refer to Admiralty message 1458 of 18th January, 1934, (a copy of which has teen forwarded to you), regarding the question of salutes to Major Bayendor, the Commandant of the Persian Na-ry# 2# Althou^i Major Bayendor’s naval rank is still un determined, there has teen no suggestion, as far as I am aware, that he should te regarded as teing of a hi^ier rank than a naval captain, and unless and until he is granted the rank of Commodore or Slag Officer, there would appear to te no grounds for complaint from the Persian Government if no salute is fired# Major Bayendor would, in fact, te in the same position as the British Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, whose rank of Captain does not entitle him to a salute. 3. Should the Persian Government decide that Major Bayehdor’s status should te raised in order that he may receive a salute, he would naturally te given the appropriate salute of his rank, tut to give a salute to a naval officer telow the rank entitling him to one under international custom (which he himself does not expect) would in my opinion, create a precedent which is liable to lead to many obvious complioptions in the Persian Gulf. Quite apart from purely local considerations, it should te remembered that warships of maritime powers also pay visits to the Gulf. It might te difficult to explain to the Captain of a warship of a Great Naval Power why a salute is given to Major Bayendor which ihe visiting officer himself cannot expect to receive.

Hawkins in January a salute had been given to him on his departure after the call. It was vaguely recollected that there had been some doubt as to whether the Officer Command ing Persian JNavy was entitled to a salute and that the Admirals Staff Officer was going to enquire into the matter. To make certain a refennce was made to the Commander-in- Chief at Colombo and he replied to the effect that a salute of seven guns had teen given as Major Bayandor looked as if he expected one. Also that when Bayandor was informed later by the dmiral’s representative that the salute was not regular, that he was not entitled to the salute by our regulations and that it was fired owing to the possibility of Persian and Britidh regulations differing in this subject. he, Bayandor, said he quite understood, expressed his thanks for the salute and said that he was not entitled to it by his own regulations rfe report the above to you for your information in case in future the question of a salute for the Officer Commanding Persian havy arises and precedents axe searched. v/e are sending a copy of this to the Senior tlaval Officer, Persian Gulf Bivision# Chancery, lehran# Pours ever, hesidency•No. 473/0-7 British Legation, Theran.

The Senior Naval Officer has been consulted informally and it is understood that there is, so far as he knows, only one occasion on which a salute would be fired for a Naval Officer of lower rank then those mentioned in the above King’s Regulation (i.e. below that of Commodore). That is to say, when a ship commanded by a Naval Officer of lower rank than a Commodore fires a salute for an officer of the rank of Commodore or above, a return salute of seven guns is fired. 3.

I understand that our Registry has ascertained from yours that the letter dated 17th June to Chancery, which is referred to in the first paragraph of Loch's despatch, has not been seen in the India Office. We think, however, that this is a matter of some importance and that it will be as well to have full information as to how it arose originally. Could you, therefore, obtain this letter and any other relevant correspondence from Bushire? I have ascertained that there is nothing in our Letters of Proceedings or other records on the subject.

Would you please refer to your official letter No. P.Z.5377/33 of the 29th August, enclosing copies of a letter of the 5th August from Loch to Mallet about the status of the British and Persian senior naval officers in the Persian Gulf? 2. We have no copy of the letter of tne 17th June to the Tenran Chancery, to wnich Loch refers, but the main point of the correspondence seems pretty clear, viz. that Mallet should, if possible,in some way prevent the Persians giving their senior naval officer superior rank to our senior naval officer in the Gulf, if they wanted to do so. It is not clear to us how Loch thinks Mallet would achieve this. We have no wish to minimise Mallet’s talents, but this seems a very tall order! 3. I have thought it best to send you this line on the J.C. Walton Esq., C.B., M.C./C\Y the point, lest the fact that Loch's letter aroused no comment might be thought to lay some onus on Mallet in the matter. 4.
