POLITICAL2/41 and 2/47 ^ Telegram Cypher To From No.C 118 Political Agent, Muscat Political Resident, Kuwait Dated the 8th March, 1947 i Reference my telegram No. C 105 March 4th 2 So far as I can gather from conversation with Thoms, with whom Americans lunched, Sultan had asked Americans to examine possibility of opening an air service to Muscat. I understand that they were not much interested but gave it as their opinion that it would be possible to site a modern aerodrome in the vicinity of Sib bub that it would cost some millions of rupees and they were not prepared to finance construction. They would, however, if Sultan wished to finance it himself, carry out the work and promise a regular service after completion. PoliticalTelegram Q From Political Agent, Muscat To Political Resident, Bahrain No. C 226 Dated the 15th July, 1943. Reference conversation during July tour• Please give name and location of Muscat airfield site which you wish me to visit. No record on our files of exact position. Political. aw../V 7 - m Confidential D.O.No.C/5 a (8i;/93 &amp; 81/88) OFFICE OF THE POLITICAL RESIDENT, PERSIAN GULF, on board H.M.S. WILD GOOSE, at sea, dated the 7th July, 1948. X ) Please refer to correspondence ending with Muscat telegram No.C/118 of the 8th March, 1947, in which it was stated that certain Americans who had visited Muscat said that it would be possible to site a modern aerodrome vicinity of Sib. 2. Stewart, before he left told me that there was a site suitable for an aerodrome about 11 miles from Muscat on the road to Hajir and that this site was inspected by the Americans who visited Muscat in March 1947. The Hajir site is nowhere near the Sib site and it is not clear whether the Americans inspected both sites or only one of them. 3. In any case, I should be grateful if you or your successor could visit the Hajir site when as opportunity arises and report whether it appears prima facie suitable fc- for modern aerodrome. P.D.
