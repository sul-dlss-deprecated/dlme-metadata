CAIiE of ^ AGEIICY L,XUI?CII n and 'SAILING 30AT3 W . HOW we have had our Boats repaired and painted, I have decided to place Hr* Bayer as Inspector and In general charge of the Launch,-and the two sailing Boats. His duties will be as follows:- ila. Launch (Special Charge). (i) To heep it spick and span, and engine ready for use at all tines, (ii) To touch up with paint here and there wherever ' and whenever necessary, (iii) To at once have f&gt; brass work' throughout, polish ed up and ready free as soon as he receives notice that Launch is rocuired by Political Agent, (iv) If Launch not in use, ho will have all brass work completely cleaned up inside and outside once per no nth . to avoid deterioration and difficulty of clearing later. For this LIr. Bayer will fix a definitc^ate* (v) He will have the Launch washed down, and especially rope fender round side scrubbled once a Month as in (iv) above arranging at the same time that it should be well dusted inside, B. Sailing Scats (General Charge)• (I) He will regularly inspect and see that they are kept clean and tidy inside and outside, and as in case of Launch, he will be particular to see that dabs of paint are put on when required, such as is often necessary when the boat returns from the stoamer and has got scraped or knocked about, the Nakhudas job, but r. Bayer will see that the latter is not slack, and keeps up to the mark anti does his job, for inst.nce, such as neatly packing away sails in gunny bags after return from the ship etc., also that tackle' and ropes are in good repair at all times. ' (vi) He will report to Political Agent whenever any part is to be replaced, or any purchases made, so as to keep Launch seaworthy and in good order. GeneralTji point is that if the N&amp;kimda ar^ crer/ are not kept under discipline, thetsr ?rill go hack to their old .slack ways; and everything will deteriorate* Hence the appointment of Ur* Bayer as general Inspector has been made. I feel confidenl he will be able to carry out his duties satisfactorily and introduce g new spirit and good tone among the Agency crew* Of courso tho Ualchuda and members of the crew will be entirely under ITr* Bayer’s orders when ha requires then* L.

Bayer, Not or Launch Driver, with effect from the 1 st. November 1929, thus raising his pay from M 46 /- to Rs 160/- per mensem with effect from the 1 st. November 1929. Lt. Colonel, Political Agent, Ku ait.n P.A. n s' V I submit below Mr, Bayer’s application for new quarters as he is expecting his mothor and sister during the course of this month. As far as I think Mr, Bayer as a temporary hand is not entitled to free accommodation and his post carries a consolidated pay. It is impossible for us to engage a special house for him as we have no funds at all from which this charge could be met. If we go to P.R. the result will be, I am afraid, still worst. We have recently increased his salary by Rs 14/- per month which brings his total amount of pay to Rs 160/- and which amount a Head Clerk can’t expect to draw now-a-days. I have carefully considered the question and find no way out of it so I fear Mr, Bayer will have to accommodate his family in the same house or make his own arrangements.

He was veiy much touched. He said he was so sorry he would be no more fit to serve you. I would suggest for your favourable consideration that following steps be taken to help unfortunate Hr. Bayer (a) He be allowed to draw his full pay for the whole of ^une , although Mr. T vj George has been carrying on for. him* a ^ J . . i A? iff- J uM- ^ (b) He be also allowed to draw Rs.20/- for May. It will be seen that the A.G.C.R. has objected to this payment and we shall have to discontinue paying this in the ( case of a relief when one is engaged. (c) Above all, we write to P.R. re coramending Mr .Bayer for grant of a gratuity on compassionate grounds. I have heard of \/ &gt;J «-v such assistance being given by Government in deserving oases. There are rules on the subject, but I think they do not / 0^ i/0 , very well apply to the category of Govt, servants to which Mr.Bayer belongs. vVe could explain the peculiar circumstances and emphasise how Mr.B’s was a very deserving case for such a help. If you see no objection we might also write demi-officially to the Resident givirg fuller details and in a more impressive manner. It is very desirable that every thing possible should be done for th*e-peen-«»ft this man, who has worked for this Office for the last 20 years2 years under all sorts of hardships and in this part of the world. As regards a relief for him: I was speaking the other day to Mr .George Athanasiades and asking if he kn-e- had experience of launch driving. He said he had. To me he looks to be quite the right person for this job and if you are also of the same opinion, may he be asked if he would like to take up the appointment. To start with he might be given Rs.140/-, with prospect of rise to the fall pay of the Launch Lriver in due course. If Mr.George agrew.i and you approve, be can be shown on the roll as from the 1st of June 19 36. Mr.Bayer mentioned to me about his private affairs - his debts etc. I told him not to worry his head about these things and that everything would be settled to his best advantage. If you v/ish I migjit draw his pay for him, give him whatever he wants fer to go on with and ask him how he wants the balance to be disposed of, Submitted for your orders please. k,i . x ■(&gt; \c .

I should thank God that I have now regained the use of my limbs and therefore am able to affix my signature on to this letter# I am extremely grateful to you for all the kindness extended to me and for the several letters you have written to my people here. Now that the doctor has opined that it will not be advisable for me to resume duty for atleast another Six months, I beg most respectfully to approach your goodself with a request that you would be pleased to grant me an extention of leave for that period. May I also bring to your kind notice that at the time of my leaving Kowait, I was made to understand by the Head Clerk that I have been granted leave for six months---three months with full and three months with half salary but not being aware when my leave was due to expire, my brother had written to the Head Clerk for particulars to which he has not yet been favoured with a reply. This is one of the reasons why I was not able to apply for an extention of leave earlier. i have also to state that 1 have signed for, and received my salary for two months, and till date I have not been favoured with a remittance of the balance amount due to me. It will therefore be a matter of great help if I can receive a remittance at the present moment. Begging to be excused and thanking your goodself for all the kindness shown to me, I beg to remain, Respected Sir, Your most obedient Servant, The Political Agent, KOWAIT.PoliUccl Agency, 'iwalt. 1&gt;V )ated 10th 'ebruary 1937* Dea r Mr • Bayer , I am very glad to hear that you are improving in health* You will resolve by this mail a .Supply Bill for Is. 340/-, the balance of money sanctions^ especially for you by the Govern ment of India on ny recommendation and the recom mendation of the fion'bie the Bolitioal Resident in vie\? of your long service with Political Agency Kuwait which needless to say is much appreciatei.

Bayer, your son end T rend in condolence of myself and the staff of the Agency to you and to other membere of his family. irs sincerely, Mrs. J. Bayer, The Gardens, CochinMrs. J. Bayer . &amp; ; The 'Gardens”, COCHIN, 30th Septr., 1938. The Political Agent, Koweit, Persian Gulf. Sir, I beg to be excused for taking the liberty of addressing your goodself in connection with my late son, C. Bayer. It is now close on five months since he died. I have been thinking of writing to your goodself, but for reasons of sentiment and propriety, I had refrained therefrom. I would state that he was the eldest of my sons, and all along the years since his father died, 15 years ago, he was my sole help, and was the means of bringing up my other children. With his death, all that was of help to me have banished, and I am now left all alone in the world to run a father-less family. I am now aged 65. Needless, considering the fact that he was second father to us, whatever resources we have had, and whatever his earnings were, were all spent for his recovery. The two long years of his sufferings were but a terrible ordeal to the whole lot of us, and our consolation has been the fact that he has been nursed by us devotedly, but it was the irrevocable will of God that he should be laid to rest, after his long years of sojourn abroad, among his own people. These are crucial days to me, and again to crown all this anxiety and pain, is the fact that my second son has fallen sick, and has been admitted to Hospital, for a serious operation. I now feel myself like a craft cut adrift from its moorings. It is this hopelessness that makes me appeal to your goodself. There is a kind place in your heart, the feeling for a mother, and to this I appeal. Perhaps you would also consider the long and faithful service of my son. May I therefore look up to you for help? Col.J.C.More, a former Political Agent, who has now settleddown in Jersey, Channel Islands, has been always writing to my son when he was sick, sending hifcf words of encouragement, and also booke to read, so that thereby his life might be lightened. He has expressed his deep regrets over the death of my£on, whom he found,to his use his own words 'a most reliable and dependable person, whom I have learned to look upon as a friend”• I beg to be excused for troubling you, but I hope most sincerely that you will be pleased to consider my case and render me whatever help you could, for which may the good God bless and reward you.
