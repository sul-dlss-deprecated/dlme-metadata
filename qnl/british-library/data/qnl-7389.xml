In 1885, a shela was formed taking out from the Harud above Band i-Kala-i-Kah, called Takht-i-Kala-i-Kah. This shela joins two other shelas, Gazindan and Mathokh, and again falls into the Harud Rud down stream of Kala-UKah. In 1903, these shelas drew away an appreciable quantity of water, and thus the fields of Kala-i-Kah were saved. People say that the Harud Rud when in ordinary flood, such as that of 1903, is the swiftest flowing of all the streams that enter Seistan ; the noise made by its water can be heard quite a mile away. In the year 1904 the Rud-i-Harud brought an appreciable quantity of water at flood time. A section with the bed slope of the flood marks of 1904 and 1903 was obtained about 3 miles above the tail of the Harud Rud in the Sabari Hamun ; the site was below many of the spill channels, and therefore not suitable to obtain maximum flood discharges ; so Baluchis were sent up the river to measure sec tions above all the spill channels ; with the surface slopes got near the tail and with these sections the maximum flood discharges were calculated and found to be as follows : Flood of 1885, 36,000 cusecs, that of 1903, 14,000 cusecs, and that of 1904, 2,000 cusecs.

When they came back the last time early in May 1905, they said that some water had passed Band-i-Islamabad, and had reached the Kala-i-Kah village, where the people were using it. But below Kala-i-Kah the bed was quite dry.

The canal took two years to dig, though a small area of autumn crop was done at the end of the first year, but it was not till the third year that a really good supply was obtained. The canal irrigates low-lying land, and like the Mirdbdd Canal on the opposite side of the river is on an easier alignment than most canals alon? the river. s The Bandar-i-Nau Canal was dug in 1896 by Mala Khdn Naib of Sarddr Muhammad Rard Khan and Sarddr Kamal Kh^n.

A small party* under Captain Webb-Ware consisting of Major Wanliss, Intelligence Branch Officer, and Mr. Ward, Irrigation Officer, marched to the Helmand River by the direct road from the Galur spring through Nawdb Khdn Chdh to the Helmand Kiver at Landiwala Muhammad Amin. * Major Wanliss had his two Native officers with him. In addition Babu Jamal Dhin of the Survey of India, Zilladar Amir Singh, and Sub overseer t opal Singh of the Irrigation Party went with this party to survey and measure. The opportunity was taken to make a longitudinal section or profile of the Work done en route. road ; the distances were measured by a cyclometer, and the vertical heights by aneroid barometer; the readings of the aneroid cannot be accurate, because the weather was disturbed, but the readings were taken at: every half mile or so ; the station where the last reading was made was in sight; the variations due to weather were at once noticed ; the general features of the section are therefore correct. From Galur the road descended the skirt of the Chaghai Hills to Alangi Pat. The road to Alangi Pat. At firSt the rGad P aSSed OVer bare ground covered by small, very sharp stones, the wash-down of the hills close by. But these were soon buried in the sand-drifts or dunes which were quickly reached. The sand has drifted up from the desert or Registdn. Further on the hills were covered with a good growth of grass and grazing plants, conspicuous amongst them being taghaz } or the desert tamarisk. In the spring the flock and camel- owners must come here in large numbers, as numerous camp sites were seen marked by the remains of the wind breaks of taghaz which they had built round their blanket huts. These camps were situated a long way from the water, as is the custom of these people all over these parts of Asia. Our party camped for the night at Alangi Pat using water brought in fakhal Alangi Pat from Galur. Alangi Pat is a large basin, or Ndwar having a hard level bottom, which collects the water off a large tract of country. The main catchment area runs up to the hills at Chah Ismail, as is shewn on the map made by the Mission. No water was found on the basin when we visited it on the 28th January 1903, though there had been several good showers not long before, and further along the road good supplies of water collected from these showers were found. The probable reason why no water is stored at Alangi Pat is that the Ndwar is large and flat, so that the water collected is spread out in a thin sheet, and is quickly evaporated by the hot sun and dry air. Probably if deep tanks were dug at suitable places in the pat the water collected in them would last a useful time because of the greater depth. It is also possible that these deep tanks would catch sand, and the water in the sandf being protected from evaporation would last still longer. This question is discussed in detail in the accompanying (Appendix 38) on a proposal to make a tank in a smaller Ndwar between AmaHf and Humai on the trade route. From Alangi Pat the party marched to Nawdb Khdn Chdh, a distance of 13 _ .. m 'wtru' or 14 miles over a country of fixedsand- Road to Nawab Khan Chah, i •n i it,* , hills whose general direction was east and west ; these hills were clothed with grass and with tagkaz. Many thin layers of block, as well as nodular kankar, were noticed chiefly on mounds and high ridges. There was no gravel or stones in this section of the road. The well at Nawdb Khan Chdh was through hard alluvial to water at a depth of 52 feet. The first thirteen and the last ten feet of depth was so sandy that a steining of logs of taghaz had been made to hold up the sides. These logs f The water at Galur seems to be held in a rocky depression which catches drainage from the hills, This depression is filled with sand and very excellent water is got by excavating in the sand. Nawab Khan Chah.6io [App. 37- were neatly laid and notched into one another, so as to form a strong close lining to the well. The remaining 29 or 30 feet was of hard compressed alluvial such as we often saw afterwards in sections in the trough, and the delta of the Hel- mand River, and also in sections exposed in the Paniam Nala further along this route. The well was situated in a small area surrounded by high sand hills ; the track from Galur was well marked, easily found and led straight on to the well. The Baluchis, living in blanket tents hidden among the sand-hills at some distance from the well, said that there were two other wells in this small hollow, buried in sand, but that they were cleared out when required. They could give no infor mation how old the well was, but the tackle, which consisted of a pulley supported on posts, as well as the sides of the well were deeply groved worn by the rubbing • The part of the rope that goes into the water of the leather* thongs by which the water was made of tnunj fibre. was withdrawn. At 5 and 9 miles to the north-east of Nawdb Kh 3 n Chdh two other wells Haiyat and Ghami Chah. Haiyat Chah and Ghami CWh were sur- veyed and measured by Babu Jamal Dhin the former to be 65 feet deep and the latter 45 feet deep, and it is believed that there are many other similar wells in the Registan. The diameter of these three wells is small, being only 2-| feet. The water in Nawdb Khan Ch^hand Haiyat Chdh is excellent, but that in Ghami Ch£h is said to be slightly brackish, the wells hold 4 or 5 feet of water when not drawn upon. Besides being fitted with a windlass and tackle ; there is a trough for watering camels and sheep, made by stakings of desert tamarisk. The flock and camel-owners live in this desert in the winter and spring, and move to the river in the hot weather. The owner of the blanket huts said that only 80 camels were being watered from this well at the time of our visit, that the water was plentiful and never dried ; they watered the camels every 4 days in the winter and every 2 days in the warmer weather. The water seems to be held in a sand bed beneath the alluvial; in the same Nature of the formation in which the water is Way that the Water is held at Ch£h Muham- . mad Raz£, Girdi Chah and other places in the Helmand Delta, described in the note on wells of sweet water in the inundated area—T/zafe the third page of Chapter XLVII and, also, Appendix 23. The map shews a dozen or twenty wells in the Registdn, probably all like these wells in sand pockets in old drainage lines from the hills. Whether or no the flock-owners have found all the available sites for water it is impossible to say from our limited experience in this tract. J About 2 miles north of Nawdb Khdn Chdh the sand-hills end and the bare plain strewn with water worn stones and gravel commences and extends to the rjver. The vista shews the characteristic lines of ancient lake margins and river beds. Twelve miles north of Nlwab Khan Chah water was found in an artificial Masiti Nawar. earthen tank at Masjid or Masiti Naw r ar, _ ,, .

We saw this supply of water the next morning ; it is also an artificial earthen tank similar to, but much larger than, Masjid Nawar. The catchment area of this tank is about 200 acres, and the tank is 90 feet long by 30 wide, and the depth of water was 2 feet on the 31st January 1903 ; 20,000 gallons of water had been retained on the local deposit of lime to which the tank owes its existence.

From the Zidrat a rapid descent is made into a gorge which comes from the east ; the width and depth of this gorge is somewhat less than that in which the Helmand flows, but the two gorges are exactly similar in other respects. The lowest part of the gorge is occupied by a dry nala, 125 feet wide ; by calcula tion it had carried a flood discharge of some 4,000 or 5,000 cusecs. We do not know the catchment area of this nala ; the rainfall, however, must consist of light showers only, and a run off of half an inch an hour would very seldom occur. Eight miles below the Ziarat, the nala escapes from the main gorge by a narrow gap a hundred feet wide out into a more open country of fixed sand-hills, covered with excellent taghaz, phog and grass grazing, and finally discharges itself into a large and deep depression called Fakir Ganj Nawar; the camp how ever, was pitched at a pool in the bed of the Paniam Nala, about 6| miles short of the tail depression and 12 miles from the Ziarat. This pool in the nala bed was due to a local deposit of stiff red clay ; it was 100 feet long and about 30 feet wide ; the water, about 15,000 gallons, was one foot, but it had been about 2\ feet deep. It was the only pool in this last length of 20 miles of the nala. The large capacity of the nala shews that at times a large volume of water must be collected in the Fakir Ganj depression. This water could never overflow into the Helmand, and it is probably all dissipated by evaporation by the dry heat and high wind that follow after the spring rains. The road from Fakir Ganj Nawar to the Helmand passed over bare plains ^ , strewn with water worn gravel. At bluffs Dunes travelling from west to east. . . iij lj ii.j large stones or boulders had collected. Across these plains barkan or dunes of red sand travelled from west to east; this direction is unusual, as the dunes in Seistan* travel from north by west to south by east. Similar dunes were met with between Nawab Khdn Chah and Masiti Nawar which were travelling on a bearing of 260° that is, they were coming from a point 10 degrees south of west, and going to a point 10 degrees north of east. * The dunes at Jazfnak are shaped by a wind on a bearing of 335 0 ; and those between Boundary Pillar No. 13 and the Sar-i-Shela are shaped by a wind that varies from 351° 10' to 353° 30'; all this information has been given in the geological notes made over to the Director-General of the Geological Survey of India. * [C639FD] NNNAPPENDIX 38.

To get a greater depth of water, two useful and well-conceived embankments have been made across the delta of two The works already earned out. ravines to catch the water flowing down them before it has had time to spread out over the level plain of the N&amp;war. But from the nature of the ground it is not possible to get reservoirs of sufficient depth of water to hold out against the great depth that is evaporated here in summer. Moreover, after a really good fall of rain, the reservoir above the em bankments would be filled to overflowing and the embankments breached. A bye wash channel could be made, but not easily, or in such a way, as would be likely to give satisfaction, because the configuration of the ground is not favour able. As the site is not favourable for deep reservoirs made by holding up the water with embankments, it would be well Alternative way of making the reservoir. tO try tO make deep reservoirs by CXCa- vating tanks in the bed of the Ndvvar. The deeper the tank the longer the water would last; but the depth of the tank would depend on the material met with in excavation, whether it was possible to excavate it, and when excavated whether the tank w r ould hold water. * At a cr UP ssthe Nawar is about miles long t»y i of a mile wide, or one squaie mile ia area more or less The catchment area did not seem to be large, the maps I saw did not shew this Nawar so the catchment could not be measured from them. Even if we knew the catchment area, we do not know enough of the rainfalh or the propor tion of the rainfall that runs off. So we cannot calculate how much water is likely to be caught here. The catch ment area can be got by survey, but the rainfall information can only be collected by recording rainfall at the Thanas for some years. + If the number of feet in a month is divided by the number of days in the month the depth evaporated daily will be got.614 [App. 38. It is probable that there is a considerable depth of shingle below the hard pat y which is porous and would allow the How to staunch a tank or reservoir. water tO escape. If SO, it Would take a long time to make this staunch. Because the rainfall comes but seldom, while &amp; the best way to staunch a tank is to run in very muddy water; the silt in the water percolates with the water into the interstices of the bottom and sides and is deposited there, and thus gradually closes them, until the tank is made staunch and retains water. The best action to take now is, I think, to dig shafts or pits at places in the area of the Ndwar to see if any one place is more suitable than another for a tank. The earth taken out from these pits should be so deposited and put to spoil that the inflow of rain water to the tank is not blocked ; so that the pits may serve as experimental tanks as well as give information about the nature of the subsoil. If it is found that the soil can be excavated, and also that it is of such a nature that it is staunch, or if not staunch, that it can soon be made staunch 5 the next thing is to discover how deep the tank may be made without losing these advantages : the deeper the tank the longer the water will last. Having determined on the depth the next thing to ascertain is the best area or size for the tank. The most suitable size to make the tank will depend on the volume of water that is likely to be caught by the tank ; Howto calculate the size to make the tank. i- •. i r ^ u ~ limited of course by the amount 01 money* which is available to be spent on the tank. It is a waste of money to make the tank too large; at the same time it is better to make as deep a tank as the nature of the subsoil will permit, so that the area of the tank is more likely to be fixed by the sum to be spent than by considerations of volume to be stored. The largest size that it is of any use to make the tank can be estimated by measuring the area of the present Mwar, and the depth of water usually collected in it. This can be got from the water marks, either by sightingf or by levelling with an Abney’s level. Then if A is the area of the Ndwar—• D the usual average depth of water collected in it. H the depth it is possible or it is proposed to make the artificial tank. X the area the tank should be to hold all the water collected— Then Xx H=AxD X=Ax D ~H In this particular case A is guessed to be about 640 acres ; H may be about 6 0 feet say ; D is guessed to be 1 foot— Then X=64oX 1 -t-6=:io 7 acres. This is a much larger tank than there is ever likely to be money to make. The calculation shews that the volume of water in these Nawars is large, but since the water is spread out in a thin sheet and exposed to a hot dry air, it is soon dissipated. The way to calculate the minimum tank required is to estimate the water that will be needed allowing for loss by evaporation. But this calculation is not of much avail, seeing that a tank, 6 feet deep, will become dry by evaporation alone by the end of July, unless this evaporation can be prevented. The possibility of preventing loss by evaporation will now be discussed. It was noticed that sand had been collected by the embankments made for „ . the reservoir. If this sand could be caught How to prevent evaporation. • . i . i i i *. i i ° in the tank, when made, it would preserve the water indefinitely. * It is assumed of course that the constructor of the tank knows how much his tank will cost per thousand cubic feet of contents. If not, he should find this out from some man who has experience of similar work in the province. t A useful way of sighting is with the boning stave. These are three sticks, or staves of equal height; two are set up, one on each flood mark, and the third is held over the deepest part till its top comes on the line of sight got by looking over the tops ol the other two. Then It the distance between the bottom of the staff and the ground is the depth of the water. Boning staves are usually made “ T' shaped to give a better mark from which to sight ; they can be improvised from walking sticks, bits of jungle, or anything handy ; the three sticks must of course be all exactly the same length.App. 38] 615 Water in a basin of some impervious material hidden in the interstices of sand is preserved from evaporation and neither wastes by absorption or evapora tion. The surface of sand is always dry, and the grains lie far apart. Below the dry grains is damp sand ; the moisture cannot rise through the dry sand above, because the spaces between the grains of sand are too large for the water to be drawn up by capillary action.* It is probable that, if the tank held water in the months of May and June when the winds that move the sand are blowing, it would be filled up by sand and the water preserved. The water collected in shallow N£wars is evaporated before the sand begins to travel, whilst it is probable that some of the places where water is found among sand-hills are deep basins that hold the water till the sand comes. Sand is readily caught by damp, and once the moisture is covered by the sand, it lasts a long time and so helps to retain the sand. This has long been recognized and is often given as the explanation w r hy water is found in sand. But I think the explanation may be carried a step further, so as to account for the water being there. The water is caught in a deep basin w’here its depth was sufficient to withstand the evaporation till the sand carrying winds blew. All sand accumulations do not contain w-ater, only some ; those sand accumulations are likely to hold water, which are situated in a depression to which drainage flows, and cannot escape; the water at Galur (vide Appendix 37) seems to be an example to the point. I am of opinion therefore that where water is required at such Ndwars a deep tankf should be made, and the spoil from the tank so disposed, that not only is the rain water caught in the tank, but also the sand, that comes with the winds in the hot weather. It may be useful to notice that the telegraph stations along the route afford Some concluding remarks on the value of set- an excellent ^ opportunity to measure the ting up and recording rain gauges. rainfall. It is only necessary to supply the telegraph master with a zinc tube such as can be bought at Rurkif for a few rupees. The rain gauge need not be established by the Meteorological Depart ment, but by the District authorities. When rain falls, the information would be readily available to the local officers, and would be of use to them in many ways. The record should be preserved because the information is most useful to the engineer. In such schemes as this tank at the Ndwar between Amalaf and Humai the area off which the water drains to the N&amp;war is easily obtained from the map, or if the survey is not sufficiently complete by a plane-table reconnaissance. But the knowledge of the catchment area is only of a very limited use till we have some knowledge of the intensity of the showers that fall. An inch of rain is— 43,560 square feet to an acre multiplied by ^ rain=3,63o cubic feet of water off each acre of land in the catchment of the N&amp;war, supposing all of it ran off and none soaked in. But some of the water that falls sinks into the ground, and never reaches the Nawar or the stream ; this amount varies with the nature of the ground. A hard rocky soil at a steep angle retains little or no water, whereas a porous soil more or less level retains all. Light showers soak in more than heavy dowm pours. It will be realised therefore that a record of rain got from a rain gauge at each Thana, where the man in charge was intelligent enough to write down the amount measured would be invaluable. Moreover^ it is most useful to know how long the shower lasted : this is an important item of information that is always overlooked in rain records. • See 'The Soil” by F. H. King, Macmillan &amp; Co., and also ' The Water in the Soil 'by Dr. J. W. Leather, Agricultural Chemist to the Government of India, (Superintendent, Government Printing India). ♦ In the arid parts of India and South Africa and many other parts of the world such tanks are made, and the fact that they are not made in Baluchistan would lead one to expect that for some reason that I have cot dis covered they are not feasible. i The cost of a Rain Gauge zinc, with turned brass rim, float and cast iron stand as approved by the Board of Revenue, United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, will be Rs.

Practical methods of measuring small flows of water. When the discharge of a water-course or kariz is less than half a cubic foot „ u u i* a second, it becomes too small to measure To measure a small flow by baling. . , J. . i • • n with sufficient accuracy by timing floats, and measuring the sectional area of the flow. It is then better to measure the discharge by baling the water. This is done by blocking the flow of the water-course and causing a small pool to form. A mark is made in the pool, and as the water rises above this mark, the surplus is baled out. A bale having a known capacity may be used, and the number of times it is filled, and emptied in a given time, must be noted. Or the water may be baled out, and thrown into a tin, or tank of known capacity, and the time it takes to fill this tank must be noted. The principle is that, you remove the whole of jthe flow of the small stream for a certain time :you measure what you remove, and you note the time during which you remove it. Such small flows are best measured in gallons per hour ; you get a figure that people can grasp, or understand. Whereas one-tenth or one-fifth of a cusec has no meaning to any one outside of irrigation work. A gallon of water weighs io lbs.; a chagalar\&amp; a bucket usually hold a gallon. A cubic foot of water weighs 62’5 lbs. nearly, and is therefore 6j gallons. A kariz at a Thana that discharged a gallon a second would only discharge about one-sixth of a cusec; expressed in this way, the volume would be meaningless to many. But if it was said that it delivered 3,600 gallons an hour, and the listener knew that one gallon was a bucket full ; he would have information that he could make use of. This method of gauging a small flow can be used for channels up to about half a cusec. It is difficult to make arrangements to bale out more than three gallons a: second. Above a speed of two or three gallons a second the operation becomes troublesome. A little practice will soon shew what can be done. To measure a flow over a notched board or weir. It is then convenient to gauge over a board, or weir. Streams only dis charging from half to one and half, or two cusecs are most accurately gauged over a board. -/tT rnrrr* fty/r'K.*/ rr, &gt; /mm nrprrrrri ■ &amp;rrfr •&gt; r rj’i &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; f / j The downstream water mu it be lowsr Man the sill of notch The channel is obstructed by a board in such a way that all the water falls over the notch in the board * * AT &lt; 6- &gt; v *r — 6 The board may be of the above dimensions* as a convenient size for such small flows.

To measure the discharge of a small channel by timing floats. When the flow is too great to measure conveniently over a board, it can be measured by taking a discharge with floats. For this purpose a run must be marked out by sticks along some straight part of the water-course. The little channel should be cleared of weeds, and obstructions throughout the length of this run. The length of the run may be 10 feet in channels of slow moving water to 100 feet in channels of very fast flow; usually 25 feet is a good length to choose. If the transit of the float is very rapid, and the run is short, the percentage of error in timing is apt to be large. When the run has been prepared, then time floats down the centre or alone* the fastest flowing water in the little channel. This can be done with the second’s hand of a watch, or with a pendulum. A pendulum is made by attaching a lead bullet, or other convenient weight to a fine cord, so that the length from the point of suspension to the centre of the bullet is 39 inches. Each swing of the pendulum is one second. If the pendu lum is made ^/inches long, it will beat half seconds. Any light substance such as dry cow-dung serves as a float. Having found the velocity in feetf per second, measure the section of the t Ha float traverses a run of 25 feet in 25 seconds, flow. This for practical purposes isthe width of the surface multiplied by the depth of water near the centre of the width of the little channel multiplied by four-fifths. If the measurements are made in feet, the area is in square feet. The section should be measured at the centre of the length of the run • but if the channel is very irregular, and the section at different parts of the run’varies much, then measure two or three sections so chosen as to get the mean section of the length over which the velocity was measured; in very small channels it is more satisfactory to take a spade and trim the channel. The di^barge in cubic feet a second will be the velocity in feet per second multiplied by a co-efficient. ^ The co-efficient for small channels under 5 or 10 cusecs may be taken as and above that y ... These different methods of measuring small discharges should be practised till the observer feels qu.te at home, and familiar with them ; otherwise when the fn'hifwo k ment amVei 1,6 Wil ’ be anXi ° US and distrau S ht and have confidence To ascertain the water that a well will give. This is difficult because the delivery of a well depends so much on the source of the water. For instance, if the well derives its water from a spring that is flowine in a fissure in a rock, or in clay or gravel, you can imagine that it is a kariz of small flow that you have blocked and bale the water out. * Make a mark m the well at the level of the water and bale out the surplus water, noting the volume and the time. The difficulty comes in here • if vou let the water rise till ,t stands still, and then make your mark, you cannot bale, foJ the velocity is a foot a second ; if in 50 seconds it is half a foot a second, and generally length of run in feet divided by time in seconds equals feet per second. £ 10 )I 1 . &lt; ■ &gt; App. 39.] 619 the water won’t flow. Every bale reduces the level of the water below the mark, or at any rate you get only a very small delivery. You must therefore reduce the level of the water somewhat and then make your mark. The flow of the spring increases, as you reduce the level of the water, because you relieve the pressure on the spring. Many wells are dug down to water in sandy soil, and then only hold about two feet of water; if a greater depth of water is attempted the sides fall in. It is easv to reduce the water one foot and make a mark, and your operations then become exactly similar to those for measuring a small kariz by baling. Another way is to bale the well dry, and measure the volume of water ob tained, noting the time it takes to bale the well dry. The volume may be obtain ed by counting the buckets full withdrawn, or by pouring the water into a tank. Then note the time it takes the water to come back into the well again. You can then calculate how much water you can get out of the well in twenty-four hours, or whatever time you are interested in. By the time you have measured the capacity of a dozen wells you will have invented a method of your own. The value of wells that do irrigation are best gauged by ascertaining the area of cultivation. This can be done by direct measurement of the area under cultivation or by ascertaining the quantity of wheat or barley seed sown. The quantity of seed sown per acre varies from 30 seers to one maund in India to from 40 to 60 Indian seers in Seistdn. The number of times the seed is returned at harvest to the sower is also a very useful thing to ascertain ; it is a quantity well known to the intelligent culti vator. If the seed sown, and the yield are ascertained, the acreage sown is of quite secondary importance. It is a well known fact to all on the Frontier that springs yield more in winter than in summer, and measurements should be made in both seasons to obtain a correct knowledge of the supply yielded by the spring.

Note on the Persian years, months and seasons by Khan Bahadur Mauld Bakhshy Native Political Attache to the Seistdn Mission. Considerable difficulty is experienced by British officers going to Persia in understanding the Persian years, months and seasons. It is impossible to collect accurate information on revenue, customs, crops or anything connected with seasons unless one understands how the Persians reckon them, and this note is drawn up with the object of explaining the years, months, etc., used by the Persians in their official and private transactions and calculations. The ancient Persian year was a solar year consisting of 365 days. The Persian historians and astronomers claim it to be of very high antiquity and carry it back to more than 800 years before the Christian era, tracing its origin to Jam or Jamshid, an ancient Persian King, who is the subject of much fable and—who is often confounded with Bacchus, Solomon, and Alexander the Great—and is supposed to have invented various arts and sciences with the help of Pythagorus, who is said to have been his Prime Minister. The ancient Persian solar year consisted of 12 months of 30 days each, and five days were added to a particular month to make the number in all 365. The Persian historians attributed the commencement of the year to the day when Jamshid, after completing his famous city, Istakhr (literally praise of sun), the ruins of which lie not very far from Shiraz, the head-quarters of the Pars Province of modern Persia, made his first public entry into it. This important event took place at the true Vernal Equinox when the sun entered Aries, and that day was instituted as Nauruz or New (Year’s) day, and was celebrated as a public festival with extraordinary rejoicings. For some time there was no embolism similar to the Christian leap year, in consequence of wffiich the New Year’s day made retrograde progress drifting back into Pisces. To remedy this a month of 30 days was intercalated at the end of every 120 years and was celebrated with great festivity throughout the Persian Kingdom. A particular name was given to every month in the year and a particular name to every day in the month, no sub divisions ot the month being made by weeks. All these names w T ere adopted from certain angels supposed by ancient Persians to control and influence all the actions of the periods committed by Omni potence to their care. These angels were divided into two classes, viz. — (1) those who presided over the months, and (2) those who ruled over the days. The former were considered superior to the latter who rvere called kdrkun (literally workers), i.e., Ministers. One day was, however, assigned to each of the archangels in his particular month which was believed to be peculiarly favoured by him and was consequently distinguished with unusual attention. A distinct (prayer) was assigned to every angel; and it was considered highly disrespectful to mutter the Zarnzama of one angel on a day patronized by another. The Kings of Persia, in obedience to this belief, used a new charm every day, on which something relative to the superintending angel was engraved ; they wore a new garment every day and had a new and peculiar dish every day at table. It w'as considered an object of the highest importance to conciliate the favour of these angels, and in consequence thereof a number of festivals were established having both a religious and a political tendency, the days supposed to be under the protection of the angels of the month being, in general, most particularly honoured. As mentioned above, the first month commenced at the Vernal Equinox, and was formerly named Azur, i.e.&gt; fire, or the angel supposed to preside over it. The order of the month was, however, changed about the end of the eleventh century when Sultan Jalal-ud-din reformed the Persian Calendar. Since then the following order has been preserved :— (/) Farvardin (March — April). —This month was so named from an angel supposed to be the Khdzin (treasurer) of paradise and to have the particular care of the souls of the blessed. On the first of this month, called Nauruz, or New (Year’s) day, began the principal festival among the Persians which continued for six days. On the first, the King gave his chief attention to promote the happiness of the body of the people ; on the second, he entertained the doctors and astrologers ; on the third, [C639FD QQQ622 [App. 40. the priests and counsellers of state ; on the fourth, the princes of the blood and grandees ; on the fifth, the royal children ; and on the sixth, which was con sidered as the King’s particular day, his subjects made him free gifts according to their ranit. On the eve of Naurus, a young man of an elegant figure, personating the New Year, was stationed at the door of the royal bed-chamber, which he entered, without ceremony, the moment the sun appeared above the horizon. The King immediately addressing him, said:—“What art thou? Whence dost thou come? Whither dost thou go? What is thy name? Wherefore dost thou approach? What dost thou bring ? ,, To this he answer ed :—“ I am the fortunate and the blessed ; I am sent hither by God, and bring with me the New Year. ” Then he sat down, when another appeared with a large silver dish, in which were wheat, barley, peas, vetches, sesame and rice (seven ears and nine grains of each), with a lump of sugar, and two new coined pieces of gold, which, as an offering, was placed before the King. Then entered the Prime Minister, the general of the forces, the lord high treasurer and the superintendent of war; after whom followed the nobles and the people, according to their dignity and respective classes. A large loaf, made of the above men^ tioned grains, was then presented to the King. After eating part of it, he offered some to those who were around him, saying :—“ This is the new day, of the new month, of the new year, of new time ; when all things consistent with time must be renewed. Then investing his nobles with rich robes, he blessed and distributed amongst them the presents which had been brought. Although this programme is not followed exactly in all its details at present, the modern programme is based on it and many of the ceremonies are still performed. The A^rw*; has in fact been preserved and is still maintained as the chief national festival and celebrated throughout Persia with great rejoicings for thirteen days during w'hich the Persians of all classes visit and entertain each other. The 19th of the month was this angel’s peculiar day during which it was reckoned fortunate to shape or putT)n new garments and to take a general survey of the state of herds and flocks in the kingdom. This belief still prevails and even now during this month herds and flocks throughout Persia are supposed to be counted. Whether this is actually done or not, the annual tax on herds and flocks (sargala) falls due at Nauruz, and has to be remitted to the Shah by every Provincial Governor during this month. (2) Ardibihisht {April — May). —This angel tvas supposed to have the charge of the keys of paradise, of mountains and the sacred fire. On its third day, which was the angel’s name day, it was thought auspicious to give battle, to go to the fire-temple and to approach the king, under the idea that all petitions then put up to their heavenly or earthly sovereign would be favourably heard. . (j) K HURD Ad {May — Jane). —Under this angel’s care were placed all seas, rivers, and waters of every kind, together with trees and herbage. The angel’s day was the sixth w'hen it was held fortunate to marry and to offer up prayers to God and the angels for relief from all distress and for the supply of every want. {4) Iir {June—July).—This angel was entrusted with the guardianship of cattle under the general supervision of Khurddd. The thirteenth was solemnized by the festival of dbrizgdn during which all classes of people sprinkled one another with water. 1 his ceremony of sprinkling water, however was not confined to this festival, as it also formed part of the entertainments of tlauruz Mihrgdn, Khurddd and Bahnian. •j MurdAd {July — August).—Mur dad (literally death giving) was con sidered as the angel of death and was supposed to be the guardian of trees herbs, fruits and seeds. The seventeenth was his day when the Jashn-i-NMfar (feast of the herb Nenuphar, which was used in the ceremony) was held It was believed that on that day all petitions presented to the king and great men were generally granted. &amp; {6) ShahriyAr or Shahraw'ar {August—September).—'XKxs angel was the custodian of all metals and minerals. Nothing remarkable distinguished his festival, which was on the fourth day. Another festival was held on the 18th day which was called Khizdn (autumnal feast). (7) Mihr {September October). This angel was supposed to be the intelli- gence which regulated the sun. It was also supposed to preside over love and friendship and was imagined to be the distributor of rewards and punishments on » *App. 40.] 623 &gt;* the day of judgment. This angel’s particular day was the 16th on which began one of the greatest festivals called Mihrgdn. To the origin of this solemnity many traditional motives are assigned, but it appears to have been held in honour of the autumnal equinox. On the 16th of this month it was considered fortunate to wean or name children. (8) AbAn {October — No i vember).~*-T\\\% angel was, like Tir, considered a subordinate of Khurddd. He was supposed to control iron. The tenth, being his name day, was celebrated as a public festival in commemoration of a great rain which, by tradition, fell on this day, after a seven years’ drought and famine. This month having been, in old times the last of the year, five supplementary days were annexed to it and formed the occasion for a continued festival for eleven days which began on the 26th of this month and ended on the fifth of the next month Azur. During this feast the ancient Persians used to place various kinds of rich food upon the tops of high towers for regaling the spirits of their departed heroes. (p) Azur {November — December), —This angel presided over fire, in conse quence of which, on the 9th, his name day, the country all round blazed with flaming piles, while the ancient Persians after paring their nails and shaving their hair and believing thus to have thrown away all their sins and defects visited, with great solemnity, their fire temples. (/o) Dai {December — January). —This angel presided over this month as well as over allthe days beginning with Dai such as Dai ba Azur, Dai ba Mihr, etc. On the 1 ith, which was this angel’s day, another great festival of fire was celebrated all through Persia, and large bunches of dry herbs were fastened to wild beasts and birds, who were then let loose and temporarily made the fields, mountains and the air one universal blaze, which was often heightened by the accidental firing of the neighbouring woods to which these terrified animals naturally fled for shelter. (//) Bahman {January — February). —This angel was supposed to be the superintendent of every created thing except man who was the peculiar charge of Ormuz, or Omnipotence. He was also the pacifier of rage and the mediator in all quarrels. On the 2nd day which was this angel’s day the ancient Persians celebrated the feast of corn and meat which they boiled together, with white and red Bahman, flavoring the dish with those herbs and pounded sugarcandy. The white Bahman they also bruised in milk, and drank it as a strengthener of the memory. On this day it was considered fortunate to lay the foundations of • houses ; to shape or put on new clothes ; to pare the nails and shave the hair ; to search for medicinal herbs and roots in order to extract their perfumes, essences and oils for the composition of drugs and spells which were imagined to have qualities much superior to those prepared on any other day. {12) SpindArmuz or Ispinda RMAD {February — March ).—This was the name of an angel to whom was assigned the care of the earthly globe and the guardianship of virtuous women, in consequence of which the fifth, his pecu liar day, was highly auspicious to every cricumstance relative to marriage. The extra month of 30 days intercalated after 120 years at the end of the first period followed Farvardin (March—April); at the second celebration it was placed after Ardibihisht (April—May) ; and on the third it succeeded Khzirddd (May—June), the five ascititious days being annexed to it. In this rotation it continued till the year 636 of the Christian era, when Yezd-i-Jird III, the last king of the Sasanian dynasty being defeated by the Arabs, Persia became a pro vince of the great Emperor of Khalifs, and the Muhammadan lunar computation being introduced in all civil and religious affairs, the intercalations of the Solar year were, from that period, neglected till 1079 A.D., when the Saljukian Sultan of Persia, Malik Shah Jalal-ud-din (Amir-ul-Umara to the Khalif Muktadi) reformed the calendar, which has since borne his name, bringing forward the Nauruz.ixovn the 15th degree of Pisces to the fifth of Aries and intercalating an embolismal day every fourth year which was thence called SdBi-kabisa or leap year. The astronomers in their tables add the five ascititious days, to the last month Isfanddrmuz (February—March) ; though they are vulgarly annexed to Abdn (October—November), because they happened to follow that month, in the intercalary rotation, at the defeat of Yezd-i-Jird, who had made an alteration in the calendar known by his name, w-hich* however, in consequence of that event, soon ceased to be publicly attended to.624 [App. 40. As already mentioned, the order of the months given above is that which prevailed in Persia since the reformation of the calendar by Sultan Jalal-ud-din, who, it is supposed, restored the most ancient mode, as originally established by jamshid. In the middle ages of Persia, however, their position was different; corresponding, according to the above order, to November—December, answering then to March—April, Dai to April—May, and so on in rotation, the consecutive order being the same in both. This, however, has produced some disagreement amongst the different writers with regard to the attributes of the angels, and the origin of the various festivals which it is of no importance to reconcile. The above outlines will be found in general sufficient and answer the purpose for which they are introduced ; that of explaining old Persian popular beliefs, some of which still exist, and giving an idea of the various customs and tra ditions to which allusions are so often made in eastern history, poetry and romance. The Yezd'i-Jirdi and Jaldli years and months are still given in the Persian almanac [Takwtm) every year for reference. The Yezd-i-Jirdi year begins in August, and the five ascititious days, which are called Kkamsa-i-Yezd-i'Jirdi, are added at the end of the month Abdn (March—April). The Jaldli year begins at the Vernal Equinox on the 21st March, and the five additional days, called Khamsa-i-Jaldli, are annexed to the last month Isjan* ddrmuzdX the end of the year. As these years have practically fallen into disuse in Persian transactions, it will perhaps be sufficient to give below the months and dates corresponding wdth the Christian year 1905-06, as given in the Persian almanac, without entering into further details about them Yezd-i-Jirdi year 12^4-^ corresponding to rgo^-06 A.D. 1274 Abdn ... 13th March to nth April 1905 ...

Each Muhammadan month is divided into weeks of 7 days. The following are the Persian names of the days of the week:— Shamba (Saturday). Yak Shamba (Sunday), Do Shamba (Monday). Sih Shamba (Tuesday). Chahdr Shamba (Wednesday)* Panj Shamba (Thursday). Juma (Friday). The week begins on a Saturday and ends on a Friday, the latter being the Muhammadan Sabbath. The day and night comprise 24 hours, but the day does not begin at mid night, as with the Christians, the sunset being considered the close of one day and the commencement of the next, so that what is called Friday night by the Christians, is maintained to be the night of Saturday by the Muhammadans ; since, according to the latter, Friday had ended and Saturday began at sunset. This is a point worthy of note in making engagements with the Persians, otherwise confusions are likely to occur, causing disappointment to the parties concerned. To prevent misunderstanding the safest way of specifying a certain night in deal ing with Persians is to describe it as the night between such and such days of the week or such and such dates of the month. The first of the Muhammadan lunar months is the day following the even ing on which the new moon is visible, and is called Ghurra ; the last, if it happens to be the 30th day, is called Salkh ) otherwise Bist-o-nuhum, The Persians have certain superstitions about the lunar months also. They believe that looking on certain objects, after seeing the new moon, brings happiness and good luck. Acting on this belief, the superstitious people arrange to have the necessary objects ready at hand at the end of each month, so that immediately after seeing the new moon their eyes should fall on them. These objects are -*s. ** r V *given in the following table with the names of the months to the new moon of which they are assigned :— Name of the Muhammadan month. Objects to be looked on after seeing the new moon. Muharram Gold, green lawn, running water, turquoises, rings, books. Safar ... ... ... ... Mirror, red clothes, polished arms, hands of lads.

The names of the following Muhammadan months are generally used in writing, with the affixes given after them:— (i) Muharrant-ul-hardm. —(The sacred month of Muharram).—Muhar- ra m literallv means sacred, or forbidden; so-named, because in consequence of the martyrdom of Husain during this month, the month is considered sacred and fighting in it is forbidden. In con sequence of this event this and the following monJi of SafciT are regarded as months of mourning in Peroia during which special prayer meetings are held everywhere and no marriages or public rejoicings can take place. (2^ Safar-ui-Muzaffar. — (The auspicious month of Safar). (7) Rajab-ul-Murajjab. —(1 he honoured month of hajab so-called on W account of Muhammad’s ascent to heaven on the night of the 26th of this month, which is called Laiiat-ul-Mi raj). (S) Shabari'Ul-Mua’zzam. —(The important month of Shd'bdn) ; (q) Ramazdri'ul-Mubarak. —(The blessed month of Ramazan). The word Ramazan implies a consuming fire, whence it is by some conjectured, that this month originally fell in the most sultry period of the summer. 1 his is the fasting month, and the festival of breaking the fast, called Id-ul-jitr, immediately fohows it, and is celebrated on the 1 st of the following month. This month is areatly revered on many accounts^ but particularly from the belief that it was on the 27th night of this month, called Lailat-ul-Kadr (the nio-ht of power), that the Alkur&amp;n began to defend from heaven On the anniversary of this night all orthodox Muham madans continue most fervently in prayer under the impression that every petition then put up to Omnipotence will be favourably received. Ramazan is also one of the attributes of God, as the pardoner.628 [App. 40. • (10) Shcnwwal-ul-Mukarram. —(The revered month of Shawwdl). —In the beginning of this month the festival of Bairani is celebrated and Id-ul~fitr falls on the first of this month. (11) Zika dat-ul-haram or Zilkadat-ul-harani or Zulka'dut-ul-hardnt.— (The sacred month of Zik'ada). This is the penult month. (12) Zihijjat-ul-haram or Zilhijjat-ul-haram or Zulhtjjat-ul-hardtn .— ■ (The sacred month of Zihijja). —This is the last month of the Muhammadan year and is so-called, because the great pilgrimage to Mecca takes place on the 9th of this month and the next day is celebrated as Wd-uz-Zuha or 'Id-i-Kurbdn (the festival of sacrifice). The third, fourth, fifth and sixth months, viz. } Rabi-ul-Awaly Rabi-us-Sdni^ Jatnadi-id-ATval, and Jamddi-us-Sdni ) are used without any affixes. Rabt, literally means spring, and it is conjectured by some that these two months were so-called, because originally they fell in the spring. J-a , mddi ) literally means withering or drying, and some conjecture that these months were so-called, because at the beginning of the era they happened to be in the autumn, and that the order of the months was afterwards changed. On the overthrow of the Abbaside Khalif kingdom by Hulaku Kh&amp;n the grandson of Jingiz Khan, and brother of Kublai Khan, the importance of the Hijra era declined in Persia, particularly as Hulaku Khan paid more attention to solar calculations. He fixed his residence at Maragha, a city in the Azarbaijan Province of Persia, and having drawn round him a distinguished body of men of science caused an astronomical observatory to be erected on a hill to the west of that city, and the “ Tables of the Ilkhani ” compiled by his friend and counseller Nasir-ud-Din, the greatest astronomer of the age, which have preserv ed his name. The Tartars, in the fourteenth century, introduced yet another series of solar years into Persia. These are called Sanavdt-i-Turki, or Turki years ; they were originally supposed to begin, when the sun was in the centre of Aquarius, but now they are practically taken to commence zithQ Nauruz or Vernal Equinox and terminate on the day preceding the following Nauruz. According to ancient Turk Astronomers of Kipchak and Uighur (or Tghiir) there is, in the heavens, an imaginary circle, or an interval of time, in which a certain succession of events or phenomena is completed, and then returns again and again uniformally and continually in the same order. This is called the cycle of the year. In Turki chronology the cycle of the year consists of 12 solar years ; hence it is known by the name of Daur-i-Asnd Ashri which means cycle of twelve. Each of these twelve years is assigned to an animal, on the supposition that the events and seasonal phenomena taking place in that year, are peculiar to the characteristics of that animal and can be easily predicted; and that the same events and seasonal phenomena recur in each cycle, which, when com pleted, commences again. Since the Turki years were introduced, the Persians compute time and seasons by regular divisions, or periods, fixed by this cycle, and they have adopted the Turki names of the years. These years are given in the table at the end of this Appendix with their corresponding A. D. years for twelve cycles, or a period of 144 years, beginning with the years 1852-53 and ending with the years 1995-96. Since the introduction of these years, in deeds, bonds, accounts and historical and other important records and transactions, the name of the Turki solar year, as well as the lunar year and its date, began and continued to be mentioned together, and the practice of expressing seasons by signs of the Zodiac was established. The use of the Turki year gradually became so common that it was, and is still considered, essential for all educated persons to learn and remember their names. For facility of remembrance, the children are made to commit to memory the following couplets containing the meaning in Persian of the Turki years in the order followed by them Mush-o-bakar-o-palang-o*khargush shumdr, Zin char cho bugzari nihang dyad-o-mdr, Wungdh ba asp-o-gusfand ast hisdb. Hamduna-o-murgh-o-sag-o-khuk dkhir-i-kdr.629 (§) App- 40 .] These couplets literally translated mean The mouse, the cow, the leopard, the hare you take, When you pass these, then come the crocodile and the snake. You then have the horse and the sheep in the log. The monkey, the fowl, the dog and the hog. During the reign of the late Nasir-ud-Din Shah of Persia, or towards the end of the nineteenth century, His Majesty’s Chief Astronomer, the Najm-ud- Daula, introduced, in the Persian Almanac, the solar Hijra year of 365 days and adopted the Arabic terms of the signs of the Zodiac as the names of the months of that solar year. These months are given below, together with their English and Persian equivalents—which latter are not used—and the number of days as signed to each month :— Names of the modern Persian solar months.

The Hijra-i-Shamsi (solar Hijra) and the Turki year and the signs of the Zodiac (Arabic terms) have lately been adopted by the Persian Government for all official purposes, and are now used by the Belgian Customs Authorities in Persian employ, and all ^ othei Persian Officials in all documents and financial accounts throughout Persia, including Seistdn. d he Priests and the common people still use Muhammadan lunar years, months and dates in their religious and private transactions, but they are also gradually adopting the Government practice in all important documents. The Muhammadan days of the week, however, continue to be used throughout Persia without any change. Seasons have for a long time been and still continue to be expressed, for purposes of weather and agriculture, by names of the signs of the Zodiac by agriculturists and others, who believe that a change takes place as the sun enters each sign of the Zodiac, which entry is called tahvil^ the entrv into each sign of the Zodiac being denoted by the addition of its name, such as tahvil-i- C639FD sss6 3 ° [App. 40. * dffdb dar ha mat, tahvil-i-dftdb dar saur, or only tahvil-i-hamal, takvil-i- sour, etc. The educated persons make use of these terms correctly, but ignorant people such as flock and herd-owners and agriculturists throughout^Persia, including Seistan, who do not possess knowledge of the various changes that have taken place in the Persian calendar at different times, often get hopelessly mixed in trying to reconcile the lunar months with the solar terms of the signs of the Zodiac and the ancient Persian seasons. It will, however, probably be possible, with the help of this note, to make out what they are driving The ordinary four seasons of the year are called by Persians:—« ■ Bahdr or FasUt-Bahar. Spring or Spring season. Tab 1 start or Garma, or Fasi-u Summer or Summer season. Tdbistdn or Fasl-v-Garmd. Khtsdn ox Fasl-i-Khizdn, or Pdiz Autumn or Autumn season. or Fasl-t-Pdiz. Zamistdn or Sarmd ) or Fasl-i- Winter or Winter season. Zamistdn or Fasi-i-Sarmd. Each of these four seasons of the year, though supposed to be of three months’ duration, retains its peculiarities of weather for only about sixty days or two months. During the remaining days, whether preceding or following that period, the weather is liable to changes and is not so marked as to make it clear whether it belongs to that particular season or the one preceding or following it. Although there may be occasional showers of rain in the Autumn and W inter the real Bahdr or Spring, |which begins at the Vernal Equinox, is the real rainy season of Persia which is called Shisha (literally sixes) since it is supposed to last for about 66 days after the hauiuz. Beginning with the 6th of Nauruz (Vernal Equinox) or six days after 21st March, the rain is supposed to fall, and often does fall in Persia, for about 66 days at intervals of about 10 days, viz., 01 the — 6 days af 16 26 3 6 46 56 66 er Nauruz corresponding to 27th March. » Sth April. r 15th April. » 25th April. t&gt; 5th May. tt 15th May. ft 25th May. ^'^ ese rains are considered to be sufficient for the dainia (unirrigated) crops which depend on the rains. In the southern, south-eastern and south-western parts of Persia, lying below the plateau, which are hotter than the uplands the rains fall earlier or during the last part of the winter and the early part of the spnng. This is the case in Seistan. There is of course no monsoon, and no rain falls in the summer. In the winter snow falls on the plateau and rain in the low-lying tracts. The Persians believe that in most parts of Persia inferior animals be^in to come to life about a week after the Nauruz ; the nightingale begins to sin&lt;r a few days later or about the end of March; and the winds begin to blow about 20th of May, when the summer is considered to commence. The real Tdbistdn or summer, which is supposed to last only about 60 days, is divided into two Chula (literally forty) which are called Chilla-i-buzurJ-i- tubist an (great C/zz*/# of summer), and Chilla-iTu$hik-i-tabistan (small Chilla 0 summer). The GhiUa-i-buzurg, or great Chilla, consists of forty days It begins about the 21st of June and ends about the end of July. The sun is believed to reach its zenith about the 4th of July, and the middle of the Chilla- l : b ^ Ur S rtf &lt; A a) that - allS ab0 J Ut r 13th or the P eriod between that date and the 8th of August is considered to be the hottest part of the year in most parts of 1 ersia. This period is also called Tamuz from the ancient Roman month of that name beginning on the 13th July,1 * • V App* 40.] 631 The Chilla-i’kuchik consists of only 20 days. It begins about the end of July and ends about the 19th of August, when real summer is taken to end and a cool breeze is supposed to begin to blow. r Y\\z Bdd-i-sad-o-bist ruz (120 days’wind) of Seistan blows all through the two summer Chilla. The summer season is believed to finally end about the 24th of September, when the Fasl-i- Khizdn or Pdiz (autumn) begins. The best time for cutting trees is considered to be about the end of October. The autumn is supposed to end on the 23rd December or two days after the longest night which is called Shab-i~Yaldd t and the Fasl-u zamistdn (winter season) begins on the following day. Real winter is, like the summer, divided into two Chilla (periods) of 60 days. The first or the Chilla-i-buzurg’i’Zamistdn (great Chilla of winter) begins on the 24th December and ends on the 31st of January. The Chilla-i-kuchik- i-Zamistdn (small Chilla of winter) begins on the 1st of February and ends on the 20th of that month. The middle of February is considered to be the best time for planting trees, as the sap is supposed to begin to rise about the 25th February. The winter reaches its height about the 5th of February, and the severity of the weather continues throughout that month and the early part of March. The winter solstice is supposed to begin about the roth of March, which is generally followed by a week of extreme cold called Ayydm-ul'ajuz, or barct-i- ajuz which means old women’s terror. The winter is supposed to finally terminate on the 20th March, and spring begins the following day, which is the Nauruz or New (Year’s) day. It should be explained that when the Vernal Equinox happens in the fore noon of the 21st of March, the new year begins the same day ^ but if it happens in the afternoon of that day then the new year begins on the following day, i.e., the 22nd of March. This has occurred in 1906. Another short disturbance takes place in the weather about or soon after the Nauriiz which is called Ahman-Bahman —names of two old Persian demons— and means the disturbance of Ahman and Bahman. It is supposed to be caused by an increase in the heat of the sun when it enters Aries. This disturbance results either in rain or another spell of cold for about a week or so. There are, however, exceptions to all the above rules which depend on circumstantial meteorological changes. Under the heading of seasons may perhaps be mentioned the different Id festivals celebrated by the Persians. Id is literally anything which returns (of happiness, care, grief or sickness), a solemnity, feast, festival, holiday, or a public ceremony held annually in com memoration of an important event. The term is, however, practically employed now for feasts of pleasure only. The Id festivals are numerous, but only the following are the principal ones which are observed in Persia at present. ld~i-Nauruz. —Feast of the Persian New Year, celebrated at the Vernal Equinox, on the 21st March. Id-i-Saghir or Id-id-Fitr.—The festival of breaking the Ramazan fast, celebrated on the first of Shaww r al. td-i-Kabir or y td-i-azhd or Id -uz-Zuhd or Id-i-Kurbdn. —The festival of sacrifices. Celebrated on the 10th Zilhijja, the day after the haj or pilgrim age to Mecca. Id-i-Ghadir. —A festival celebrated on the 18th of Zihijja on which the prophet is believed by the Shia to have announced to the pilgrims that Aii should succeed him. td-i-Guldbi. —A feast at the beginning of the spring when presents of flasks of rose-water are made. This festival is not of any importance. td-i-Maulud-i-Hazrat-Rasiil. —Anniversary of Muhammad’s birthday, cele brated on the 17th Rabi-ul-Au r al.

Macpherson, LA., His Britannic Majesty s Consul for Seistdn and Kdin, to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, dated Seistdn, the 6th of January 1906. I have the honour to enclose for your information a statement of the revenue of beistan as recently assessed by Mirza Sayad Khan, Mustansir-ul-Mulk. 2. The information was obtained from original papers in the of the Mustaufi of the Hashmat _ ul-Mulk, and can, therefore, be accurate. possession accepted as . T will be noticed that the revenue, as now assessed, amounts to 16,000 Seistam kharwar of grain and 16,525 toman cash, which is approximately 4 000 kharwar of grain and 14,000 toman of cash in excess of the figures of the previous assessment of 1885. One kharwar Seistani is equivalent to 2 kharwar labnzi, or approximately 15 Indian maunds. r ?PP arent discrepancy in the totals of the figures for the subdivision o Miankangi, as shown in the first of the statements of the revenue by Districts (page 637) and in the detail list of the revenue of that district, (page 64^) is due - t0 °f ^ ra ’ n ^. av ^ n S been subsequently deducted from the revenue payable in kind and its equivalent value taken in cash. 5. In addition to the details of revenue, statements of the allowances paid to the various local officials are also attached. These latter amount in grain to 4,950 kharwar, and in cash to toman 5,216. 6. Deducting the above allowances from the total assessed revenue, the balance actually creditable to the Central Government is grain 11,100 kharwar and cash toman 11,309. 7. The above figures worked out in Indian currency, assuming that the cash equivalent of a Seistani kharwar of grain is toman 10: which may be taken as a fair average rate, stand as follows Total assessed revenue ... a 11 Allowances paid, deduct ... ”* *” 1^6700 Net amount creditable to the Central Government Comparison oj the Revenue fixed by the Mustansir-ul-Mulk with that given in Chapter Kill of the “ Revenue Report and Notes.” In the opening sentence of Chapter IX it is stated that a separate chief revenue officer had been appointed in Seistan ; Captain Macpherson has now sent his assessment of the revenue to be paid by the Hashmat-ul-MuIk to the Centra Government. The assessment is in great detail, as it gives the name of each village, and, a new feature, the person with whom the revenue contract has een made. These villages are all given in Statement A and B for Persian Seistan, but it would occupy too much space to compare the revenue figures for each village ; in a few cases the village appears in a different mahal in our State- m ( e !u S ’r fu ° th - e na P ies differ and the village can only be traced by the name of the kadkhuda ; in others the kadkhuda has been changed ; the reasons for such discrepancies can only be gathered by enquiries on the spot.

The value of the government share on this classification of the produce of the crops has been made for each of the tracts shewn in the state ment on page 93 of Chapter XIII, and it is found that in each case the assess ment come? to 44 or 45 per cent, of the value of the government produce shewn by our figures; and there is very little doubt but that the_ Mustansir-ul-Mulk has estimated 3 the Central Government’s share of each mahal in some such way as we have done. To compare his assessment with the figures in Chapter XIII, it is necessary to assume that two-thirds of the grain to be paid is wheat and one-third barley, and to value the wheat at one hr an a kharwar and the barley at 661 krdn a kharuoar. The revenue derived from gardens must be deducted from that given in column 22 of the statement on page 93 of Chapter XIII. The comparison is given in the first statement immediately at the end of this note in this Appendix. It will be seen that the Mustansir-ul-Mulk has taken 45 per cent, of our estimate of the Government share of the produce of the ploughs. When the allowances are deducted from his settlement, and the cost of collection from the figures in column 22 of the statement in Chapter XIII, the revenue assessed comes to 38 per cent, of the value of the Government share of the produce of the “ ploughs.” The “ taxes other than Land Revenue M can be conveniently compared with our estimate of their value made on page 94 of Chapter XIII ; it will be seen that they are all about one-fourth less, except the shop tax which we over-estimated ; and the rishta-gdvi, which we have calculated too low, evidently. The value of the new garden tax is given on the last page of Chapter X, viz., 5,414 krdn against 3,142 krdn assessed; that is more than two-fifths less than our estimate. The Hashmat-ul-Mulk, it is presumed, will continue to pay the Wali of Meshed at 50 krdn per kharwar for the grain, so he will pay— Krdn. 11,100 kharwar of grain at 50 krdn ... ... 555,000 Cash ••• ••• ••• ••• I 13,090 668,090 Sum paid now, vide the top of page 88 of Chapter XIII ... 381,000 Increase in assessment ... ... ... 287,090 * * It would be interesting to know on what system the Mustansir-ul-Mulk worked in making his assessment. The people will be full of talk, and with the information given on the subject in the “ Revenue Report and Notes”, it will be easy to understand from conversation with them whether it is a good or bad settle ment. A study of the figures shews that he has assessed the Miankangi as heavily as the RudT-Seistan tract, and therefore that he does not think it necessary to continue to give inducements to the leading men to extend cultivation in that tract. The figures seem to shew that the Pusht-i-Ab Mahal has been assessed lower and the Nahruf higher than the other mahdL With reference to the paragraph on “ guarding the hand ” in Chapter XIV, it is noticed that the Hashmat-ul-Mulk has been given, for the first time, an allowance of 2,500 Seistani man for this, and other expenses, connected with its annual reconstruction; it would be interesting to know on what principle this has been given. The revenue notes are all set up in type and the final proof under scrutiny, so that it is not possible to add any remarks therein on the valuable and interesting information now furnished by Captain Macpherson. In conclusion it may be said that the spelling of the names of the people and places has not been altered to that adopted in these Notes, as there is not time to refer doubtful points to Captain Macpherson, and mistakes may be made, which will give more trouble to detect, than the uniformity in spelling would compen sate for.nr f 645 APPENDIX 42 . Glossary of Seisidni Words. A glossary of Seistdni words useful in conversing with the people on the soils, the River and Irrigation, the Hdmun and Naizdr, the Cultivation the Herds and Flocks, the Weather, etc., was kept up in the note-books of Lala ihakur Dass, Supervisor, and Amir Singh, Zilladar. during our stay in Seistan ; perhaps some of these words may be useful to others visiting the country. Seistdn being a rich oasis on the high road from India to Persia is a country whose dialect should be most interesting and instructive to study, but we were too fully occupied with our own work to make a study of the language ; and we have only attempted to preserve the vocabulary of words needing special expla nation. Many of these words are pure Persian used in the same sense as they are used elsewhere in Persia, but they will nevertheless be useful to the visitor from India. The dialect of Seistdn differs both from modern Persian spoken by the well educated Persian officials met at the Consulate, and from the 1 e rsi ^n spoken in India ; though the Persian spoken by the Afghan officials_ and the Saniardni Baluch Sarddrs along the Helmand is very like that spoken in India: our subordinates, who had read Persian as a classic at school were able to understand, and converse with these without difficulty. A very large proportion of the inhabitants are Baluch who all speak Persian ; those settled down in per manent villages near the City talk like the modern Persians while those further removed from the City, in Afghdn Seistan, up the river and the nomads speak a Persian similar to that of Afghanistan or India. It will be seen that Seistdn is a very interesting and instructive country to the linguist, for, in addition to these dialects of Persian probably full of words used in their more ancient sense, there is Baluchi, Pushtu and Braun; t e Baluchis, as already said, almost without exception speak Persian. I ushtu an Brdhui is spoken by some as a mother-tongue, though they a 1 understand and speak Persian as well.

The Baluchis describe three ancient troughs as leaving the KhAsh Rud above Razae, which they say are like the troughs of the Sena Rud and the Trakun Rud. These troughs, they say, have each a canal in their beds just the same as the canals in the two troughs of the Helmand just mentioned. Going upstream, ».8 miles from Gurguri, the first trough is called* Tal-i-Udaddd, the next is named Puda Tal, the third is called Kotori. The heads of these three canals are said to be cut through a hard alluvial cliff which shews no sign of wea thering. The canals run in the direction of Amiran, and the old Naib Sultan of Chaharburjak told the gallant Khdn Bahddiir Shaikh Mohi-ud-din that these canals were the original Zorkan and Zarkan, which took out from the Khash, and came across to the Helmand Delta, and the Khdn Bahddur hoped to investigate this when he reached the Khdsh Rud. Our levels since taken shew that it is not possible for canals of the one river to go far on to the Delta of the other. It is said that, in the 1885 flood, water found its way down all three of these canals. It is, also, said that the water from the Razae canal can be run to escape into the Kotori. All this is very interesting and indicates that the old beds and canals of the Khash Rud are as important a feature of the country as those of the Helmand. * Tal is a low bed. Puda means ruined or destroyed. Kotcr is a thorny shrub which ^rows there in abundance. It is used elsewhere on the top of garden walls.APPENDIX 33 . CONTENTS.

The Ferries near the mouth of the Fardh Rud, and the Fords below Guzar-i- Ktmdja Kasim have been seen by the Mission. All the other information is collected from the people by Lala Thakur Dass t Supervisor } and has not . . been checked by visits to the spot. Ferries. Guzar-i-Pir Murdd or (Jd-i-Kashak-i-Tiitin ox ferry).—So called after the Zidrat that is close by. The bed of the river consists of clay with a little gravel. At this site the river is 220 feet wide, with still water 26^ feet deep, Tutin are kept here and people generally cross at this ferry until the fords further up the river appear. The current is so rapid, even at the ford of KTwdja Kasim, that sheep cannot cross the stream when there is only about 9 inches of flowing water. So long as the river at Khwdja Kdsim is unfordable to men, and during the time that the depth of water there is about owo kad or 5‘5 feet; the tutin at this ferry of Fir Murad is worked with difficulty. When the river is in high flood they say that the ferries cannot be worked at all owing to the swiftness of the current. These tutin are worked by a tribe of Baluchi called ‘Taifa-i-Saliman’; as a rule, they cultivate lands, but they are also the best swimmers in Seistdti. At this ferry and two others up the river, tutin are kept by this tribe. They charge one kran for 20 to 30 sheep, or for 4 to 5 men. They collect their dues in grain. The tutin are large ones. A thick rope made of kirta grass is stretched across the channel, and made fast at both ends. When the river is full and flow ing it takes some time and pains to stretch this rope. The ends of the rope are tied on gourds, and some of the strongest and best swimmers, bouyed on gourds, take the ends, and start about half a mile upstream of the ferry. After 2 or 3 trials they succeed in tying the ends of the rope across at the site of the ferry. Guzar-i-J-u-i-MuhammadDarwish (Jd-i-Kashak-i-tutin or ferry).—The bed consists of clay with a little gravel. Width of the river at the ferry 227 feet, depth of still water 22 feet. This ferry is worked just like the one at Ziarat-i-Pir Murad. Guzar-i-Ffasan-i-Khuddddd {Jd-t-Kashak-i'Tutin or ferry).—The bed con sists of clay with a little gravel. This is also a ferry, just like that at Pird-Murad •or Ju-i-Muhammad Darwish. But tutin are not always kept here, if necessity arises, a tutin is placed temporarily at this place. In 1903 and 1^04, no tutin were kept here. Fords. The fords at the mouth of the river. — While the Mission was in camp on the left bank of the Riid-i-Fardh at Ziarat Pir Murad, there was a good ford about 2 miles down, and below the Kurg-i-Gard ; the camels had to cross the mud flats on either side of the water, but the mud was just sufficiently hard to enable this to be done. It was a chance ford, and a very useful one. Guzafi-Kucha-i-Nahak (Ford).—The bed was dry and consisted of gravel overlying hard alluvial. The story is that long ago some innocent people were killed at this place ; and hence it is called Kucha-i-Nahak.— Kucha is a road, or rather a lane. This ford appears last of all. The banks of the river, are very high ; and there are deep pools in the bed of the river, only one chain below the ford. Peo ple cross here when the depth of water is about 2*5 feet or less ; if the depth is greater, there is great danger of being carried into the deep holes and drowned. When the depth of water at KhwAja Kdsim is 2*0 feet; they say it is 5 feet at Kucha-i-Nahak.59 ° [App. 33. Guzar-i-Bahring*-i-Sabz (ford).-The bed consists of small gravel The ford appears later than the ford at^ Khwaja * a fixed sand-hill. K&amp;sim, but earlier than Guzar-i-Nahak. The current is not so strong as at Kucha-i-Nahak. But when a man once loses his foothold, he is carried away by the current into deep water. When at Guzar-i-Khwaja Kasim the depth is 3 feet, it is said to be 4 feet at Bahring-i-Sabz. Gusar-uKhwdfa Kasim (ford).-The bed consists of small gravel and is hard. This is the best ford in the vicinity. The river has a sharp bend here, and the current helps a man to go from one bank to the other. The ford is very wide, and there is no danger of a man being carried away into deep holes. When the depth of water is more than 3 feet a man cannot ford, nor can a camel cross in more than 3’75 feet of water. In its ordinary rise the river is ford able here, while at other places it is not. \Guzar-i-Khairdbdd andDdrg (right bank).—The former village is on the left bank of the Fardh Rud. This ford is better than the one at Khwdja Kdsim, as the width of the river is greater ; and depth comparatively small. This ford appears before the one at Khwdja Kdsim. In 1904, the river at Khairdbad was not fordable for about 5 days only. The water for drinking purposes is got from wells in the village. About 30 or 40 days before Nauruz the Farah Rud is generally in flow. Even if water comes 10 days before Nauruz, they sow wheat. Later on they can- not sow wheat, and in the years-when the Riid-i-Farah remains dry till Nauruz no wheat is sown in this village. The cultivators at Ddrg obtain water from a small spring, which takes out from near Ziarat-i -1 mam Zdda about 2 miles above Darg. This spring is at the foot of a vertical cliff, 2 miles away from the Rudd-Fardh. The water is peren nial. A small water-course carries the water to Ddrg. Guzar-i-Samoor (right bank).—This ford is even better than_ the ford at Khairdbdd, as the river is wider here. Upstream of Samoor there is a spring in the bed of the Fardh Rud, which constantly flows. No one remembers it ever bein» dry. The water from the spring is enough to sow, and ripen 6 or 7 Juft gao, each juft gaosomng about 100 manX j Enough for 10 or 12 acres. Seistdni of seed. Generally they do more sowings, as the water in the Fardh Rud arrives in time to ripen the crops. Meshedi ’Ali says that the spring takes out from the ^ dasht north of Jawain, and is about 3 miles away from the bank of the Fardh Rud. Guzar-i-Lash (right).—This ford is even better than the one at Samoor.. The Dak between Fardh and Lash crosses on this ford. It appears earlier than the ford at Samoor and Khairdbdd. In 1903, the river here was not fordable for 6 days when the river was full. Guzar-i-Panjdeh {right) —Lash has no cultivation. The river passes under a high vertical cliff like Kim-i-Sufid. The fort in which the Regiment of the Amir-i.Kabul is stationed is situated on this high dasht. This ford is like Khwdja Kdsim. The valley is narrower than at Ldsh or Samoor ; and the fords appear about a week later than the fords at Ldsh and Samoor. Below Panjdeh the people of the villages drink either well water or the water that stands in pools. But above Panjdeh, water can be got by removing the boulders, and making a pit about 2 feet deep. Pools also occur in the bed, but the bed is said to have db-i-chashma under the boulders. Water got in this way is called db-i-skand. No cultivation can be done, as the land lies very high. t Three months after Nauruz in 1885 or eleven weeks after the flood came down the Farah Rud, Meshedi Ali, son of Shahnur, said he crossed the Farah at Khairabad. He says that the ford at Khwaja Kasim had appeared a few days before he crossed at Khairabad. / * * sApp. 33.] 591 4 # .... ... Guzar-i-Sar»i-Band i-Juiuain (left) or Karawanrez. —This is like the ford at Panjdeh. It is not a very good ford. This ford is also called Karcnvunrez, as it is on a big road ; and karawan halt here to rest their camels. Juwain is about 7 or 8 miles from Riid-i-Farah. The people drink water from wells. The people of Juwain put a strong band across the bed of the Far£h, so that if any water comes down, they take it away in their canal and sow wheat. If the quantity of water is greater than they require, the surplus is utilized by the village lower down. The bed has Ab-i-Shand. The pools in the bed are also very deep. * Guzar-i-Pir-i-Kunder. —This ford is so named after a Zidrat called Pir-i- Kunder. The ford is used by M&amp;lddr people chiefly, as it is belter than the ford of Juwain. '1 he river here is wide and shallow. Guzar-i-Tujg (right).—This ford is better than the ford at Juwain, as the river is broad and shallow. Tujg is said to be a big village having about 30 Juft gao. It has two small canals—one is fed by a spring from a small hill, and the other is fed from the springs in the bed of the Riid-i-FarAh. The people of Tujg sow wheat early from these springs. The village has many gardens. The water mill is said to grind 100 man Seist£ni of flour in 24 hours. Guzar-i-TakhtA-Teeosk or Twist (left).— This ford is like that of Juwain 4 m. not a very good one, as it appears late. This village gets drinking water from the Rud either from pools or from Shand. As at other villages there is a band, which is repaired annually so as to hold up the w’ater when it comes down the river. Guzar-i-Naudi (left).—Naudi village is said to be half a day’s journey from the town of Farah. The ford is about \\ miles upstream of Band-i-Naudi. This is a very good ford, as the river is very broad and shallow here. Naudi is said to be the biggest village under the Hakim of Fardh. It has 40 Juft gao. Naudi is a notable place, because the low river supply of the Rud- i-Far&amp;h does not go further than it. To Naudi the supply in the river is perennial. No one remembers the river ever having dried up. When a high supply comes down the river, the surplus quantity is passed over the Band-i- , Naudi. There are two small canals for Naudi village. Each of which is equal 4 K - incapacity to the Khvvdja Ahmad canal, thus the water coming down to Naudi may be estimated at about 20 cusecs ; and this supply is said to be perennial. Ddrdbdd (right) or Guzar-i-Khdn-i-Pulan.—T\\e ford is a very good one. It is said that there are ten piers or rather remains of piers of a big bridge which stood here in old times. The ford is a little north of this line of piers. The river is broad and shallow, and unless the river is in flood, the ford is serviceable. There are two canals for Dd.rd.bdd—one is named Gamar and the other is called Ju-i-Kashdn. Dardbad has about 30 Pag do ; and a large number of gar dens. Guzar-i-Shahr-i-Fardh (left).—The river here is very broad and shallow. ^ # It flows just under the town of Fardh. This ford is considered the best in the neighbourhood, as it appears first of all other fords after a flood. When Dardbdd antf Nauai fords have about 3*0 feet of water the ford at Fardh has about nine inches less of water. The bed of the river is also hard and does not change at all. Fardh is a big town. The people say that the taxes on (1) gaoddrs, (2) sar khanai, (3) sar ramai, (4) camels, (5) cattle, and (6) weavers, etc., recover ed in cash amount to 12 lakhs of kran. The Government assessment on produce is in addition to this. Guzar-i-Bahring Tut (right).—This ford is better than Guzar-i-Shahri. r ?

Guzar-i-Sibasti. —There was a village called Sibasti here, which is in ruins now. Miscellaneous information. Kurg-i-Gard or Dahana-i-Fardh Rud in the Hdnuin-i-Sdbari. Kurg means hole, Card* means deep or great. The people of Juwain, Kalala and other villages on the banks of the Farah and Harud Rud call this Kurg-i-Zdrd, because they say the water in this hole becomes yellow, when not replenished for a long time as in 1902. But the people of Persian Seistan call it Kurg-i- Gard. This is a long deep hole in the bed of the river about 6 miles long, 200 feet wide and from 20 to 30 feet deep; this long hole gets shallower as the river approaches the Sabari Hamlin, so much so that at the tail the depth is only i‘6 feet (January 1905), and we were able to cross our camels here with ease. Local tradition says that the Kurg-i-Gard is the Gilkan-i-Peshdwaran. The soil at this place was eminently good for brick manufacture. They dug up the earth, mixed water with it, and used bullocks to pug it. Mulld Ibrahim of Khel-i-Gaz-i-Yakka, near Machatak, says the tradition is that when Peshawaran was being built, the Rud-i-Farah did not flow into the S£bari H&amp;miin. The present river channel stopped at Lash and Juwain, and at its tail was a big canal, which irrigated the lands near Machatak, etc. In course of time this very canal became the river channel ; and Kurg-i-Gard which was shallow at first gradually changed into what it now is. No one in Seisin remembers the Far£h Rud flowing in any other direction. The river has found a very direct course to a deep part of the Hamlin and the great velocity down the steep slope has scoured out this deep channel. Doubt less when a delta has been built up the velocity will gradually slaken and the hole silt up. The banks are well dotted with padah trees and a great number of trunks of trees are scattered over the delta ; perhaps the accumulation of a long time, as no one seems to remove them; they are too far from the markets. Such trees on the Helmand are eagerly used. In 1902, when the Hamun-i-Helmand dried up, there was about 10 feet of water still left in Kurg-i-Gard. they say that a huge number of fish from the Sabari Hdmun migrated into Kurg-i-Gard. So much so that Kurg-i-Gard was crowded, and people Irom all parts of Seistan came and caught the fish, but when the water became foul and black, the fish died in large quantities. After a while, all the fish died and the water became undrinkable; the people then dug holes on the banks of Kurg-i-Gard, and thus got sweet water. No one remembers to have ever seen the Kurg-i-Gard dry. There is a proverb in ‘ Iran’ or Persia that so long as there is water in the Kurg-i-Gard, the people of Seis- t£n cannot die of hunoer. o 7 he old channels or escapes from the Rud-i-Fardh. The Rud-i-har^h has three old channels by which water overflows and escapes to the Hamiins in very high or extraordinary flood; these are-— (i) The Bandud-i-Juwain. (ii) The escape towards Kala-i-Kah and the Harud Rud, known as the Khush Rud, or Rud-i-Kharikl. (iii) 1 he Riid-i-Banduki, also known as Banduki-i-Pashmika, or Banduki- i-Kucha i-Nahak. The Banduki-i-Juwain flowed in great volume in the flood of 1885 ; this old channel has not been seen by any one belonging to the Mission, but from the descriptions of the Afghans and Baluchis, there is a wide trough through the dasht, which leaves the gorge of the Farah Rud, a little to the south of Juwain and leads direct into the Hdmun-i-Puzak. The distance along this trough is said to be about 20 or 25 miles, and the general width of the trough throughout is said to be about five miles, though at places it may be only a third of that width. The opening or gap in the bounding ctasht on the left bank of the Farah Rud is about miles wide and extends from Juwain to Puzu-i-Laftan, and forms a wdde, So the people said; but the ufual meaning of gard is for the winding of a river or for a whirlpool. !&gt; ♦ 4 * * *App. 33-1 \\% 593 open, low*lying plain covered with mounds, sand-hills and scrub bushes and in ancient times was cultivated; river spills were kept out by a large embankment, which extended from Juwain to Puza-i-Laftan ; even now the higher lands are cultivated, the cultivation being protected by embankments from the floods from the river: but in the great flood of 1885 the big embankment was swept away and the water flowed in a broad deep stream to the Puzak Hdmun. Some eye-witnesses consider that more water went down this channel direct to the Puz4k H£mun then went down the Rud-i-Fanih itself to the Sabari Hdmiin. It is said that although the flood of the banlh Rud was itself red with silt, a large amount of sand and soil was washed* off the bed of the trough and carried into the Puz£k Harnun, so th^-t the depth of that depression was much reduced. In the bed of the Banduki*i-Juuam there are said to be many shela which collect w r ater at every rains, where it remains till evaporated by the hot winds. The Rush Rud or Rud-i-Rhanka has been described on the first, pa^e of Appendix 35 on Harud Rud and need not be further noticed here. The Rud-i-Banduki i-Pashmika is a small channel which takes off at the sudden bend of the river about 3 miles above our camp at Dahana-i-Rud-i-Fanih and flows towards Tappa i-Machatak. Pashmika is a weed eaten by cattle, or sheep which produces a fluff like wool {pashm) ; this weed grows luxuriantly on the bed of this spill channel; hence the name. The shela is deep, and in a great flood is not fordable ; in 1903 the stream in flood was about 500 feet wide and 8 feet deep. The flood of 1 go2- In I9°3&gt; water in the Far£h Rud first came about the 15th January; *.&lt;?., in time to sow wheat extensively. Seven days later Sahib Kbdn, an experienced flock-owner, tried to go across the river on a camel, but failed. Twelve days after, i.e^ about the end of January, he crossed on a camel ; and then the river became fordable to men also. Seventy days after this, i.e., about the end of March, another flood came down, which lasted for three days. In 1903, the Rud-i-Banduki is said to have flowed for 30 days; and the ford property, except two men who were swept away while crossing at the ford of Khwaja Kdsim. After the flood the river was in flow down to its tail in the Sdbari H£mun till Tirmah, i.e., about the end of August 1903. But the river was in flow down to the Band-i-Juwain throughout the year 1903-1904. The village of Juwain therefore sowed a good deal of wheat and melons. Some water passed down the old channel of the Fanik Rud, which leaves the present river near Juwain, and goes to the Puzdk H^miin, which has already been described as the Banduki-i-Juwain. The flow is said to have reached the Puz£k Ftemun and soon after stopt. The distance from the river to the Hdmtin by this channel is said to be about 25 miles, but the flow in 1903 was dowm the narrow shela in the bed, and never exceeded miles in width. The Rud-i-Farak in 1 go2—On the 10th of March 1905, water in the Farih Rud reached Bahring-i-Sabz, and then the Hamun-i-Sdbari the same day ; this was only a small flood. On or about the 26th March 1905, another flood came down, which swept away the which was at Reg-i-Pir Murad, when our camp was there; it had been moved down to Khel-i-Meshedi Imam to be near the Khel. After the flood had come down the men had to make a new tutin. On the 30th March Baluch guides were sent to bring measurements of the water that was running in the Rud-i-Far£h. They took measurements at Bahrin&lt;r- i-Sabz on the 1st April 1905. The depth of water in the middle of the stream was 4 8 feet; the surface width was 205 feet and the volume 2,957 cusecs ; the maximum surface velocity 4.5 feet a second. The Baluchis again took measurement on the 10th April 1905 ; and this time at Guzar-i-Nahak. The river was full ; and at the fords at Nahak and Bahring-i- Sabz it had been twice unfordable for two days together. On this occasion the surface width was 210 feet, and the depth 4’6 feet, giving a volume of 2,512 cusecs and a maximum surface velocity of 3'7 feet a second. * Soil scoured and brought off the surface of the country by rain, or flood water is called dasht mal.

Nor is it chashma khez, i.e., it has no springs in its bed. It flows only when rain falls on the hills and on the country in its catchment area. After a heavy fall of rain on the hills, Ru.d*i'Bandan will remain in flow for ^ or 6 days, while the Rud-i-Harud continues flowing for 2 to 3 months, if the rainfall on the hills is good. But if the rainfall in the Band£n hills is extraordinarily heavy, the volume of water brought by this Riid is sometimes greater than that brought down by the Harud Rud. The Riid-i-Banddn stream is not so wide as that of the Rud*i-Fardh, and its depth too in most places is less than that of the Rud-i- Far£h. In 1904, Rud-i-Banddn brought only a small quantity of water, but in , 9°3j ^ was in great flood and discharged a large volume into the Kur^-i-Kal for a week. At Guzar-i*Yak Farsukh, which is one farsukh, or about 4 miles above The two distributaries of the Rdd-i-Bandih. Bahring, the Rud-i-Band£n» bifurcates ; the smaller branch runs into the Sabari Himun near Kala-i-Mir’Alam Khd.n; the larger branch empties into the Kurg-i-Kal. The bed of the Riid-i-Bandan is of shingle; and its slope is very great. &amp; Flood of 1885 .—the flood of 1885, the’Rud-i-Band£n brought down some water at the time of Nauruz. Meshedi ’Ali had removed himself from the Naizar on to the high ground near the tail of the Rud-i-Band^n, and all his cattle were grazing in the bed thereof. The banks of the Riid above the place where it enters the gentle slope of its delta in the Hamiin are vertical; the cattle found good grazing between these vertical banks. The big flood in the Helmand had come, and had begun to subside, so it was not expected that the Rud-i*Band£n would bring any very large volume of water so long after the Helmand flood. But 15 days after Nauruz, one midnight when all the cattle were in the bed of the river, the Riid-i-Bandan came down suddenly in great volume, and carried away all the calves, and a large number of the cows, the total number of animals lost being about 250. The Rud-i-Bandan thus ruined Meshedi ’Ali; and he was no longer a gaodar except in name. The fords on the Rud-i-Banddn, The following are the places where the Rud-i-Banddn can be forded when it is in flood :— One farsukh, or about 4 miles above Bahring, is the ford called Guzar-i-Yak Cuzar-i-Yek Farsukhi. Farsukh This is a good ford. The river is wide and has a shingle bed. If the river has about 6 feet of water at other places on its bed, the depth on this ford is only about 3-5 feet. When the depth is more than 4 feet a man cannot cross the stream. Six farsukh, or about 24 miles above Bahring, is the other ford, called Guzar-i-Balakman. Here, too, the bed is broad and has shingle. The bed does not change. One farsukh above Guzar-i-Balakman is the ford called Guzar-i-Kurdgaz. The bed is very hard. No shingle, i.e. % loose stone, is found on the bed. The soil itself is very hard at this place both above and below the ford. It is a very good one, much better than No. 2 above. * Major Wanliss crossed the Rud-i-Bandan during the heavy fall of rain at the end of April 1903. He described the volume of the flow as very great. We crossed the delta on the 30th April. The volume was quite small, perhaps too cusecs. We came down the channel from Bandan about the 5th May. It was then practically dry. Unfortunately I did not think to measure any flood sections. '1 hese would have been very interesting. They can easily be got by any one living at Nasratabad who has a bent for Enginsering or Survey. C639FD m596 [App. 34 ' Eight farsukh, or about 32 miles above Bahring, is the ford called Guzar*i- Shand i-Yak Farsukh. This ford is one farsukh below Banddn. If the river is flowing at all high a man cannot cross. Thus the ford is not a good one. ford called Guzar-i-Kiirdgaz. People crossing the Rud-i-Banddn when it is flowing use either of these fords. as well as in winter. It is a large spring; and in summer the water-course that flows out of it is 2'5 feet wide and about 1*5 feet deep. In the winter season, the flow is even greater. In the opinion of Meshedi ’AH six kharwar or, i.e., 600’'' man Seistdni of seed can be sown and ripened with the water that this spring yields. All the gardens and the date palms about Bandan are irrigated from this spring. There are not more than two ploughsf of cultivation at Banddn. But there are any number of gardens with date and other fruit trees. The people of Banddn exchange dates and other fruit for wheat and barley from Seistan. Some of the people of Banddn work at making mill stones in the Banddn The manufacture of mill stones in the Bandan hills. The head of the establishment, or is ’Ali Mahdi who is known by the name of ’Ali Mahdi As Kot. Enough for 75 acres of land ; on the 4th May 190.1, I measured the flow in the Zainalabad karez, and found only 04 or a cusec, about 120 gallons a minute. The width of the karez was y$ feet and depth half afoot. The Bandan W0 was not measured. About 125 acres of wheat and barley are cultivated at Zainalabad and loo acres at labasin, and perhaps 40 acres at Bandan. t The small area of cultivation was noticed by all of us as we rode through on 5th May 1903. Of the four fords named above, Guzar-i-Yak Farsukhi near Bahring is the The best ford. best. It appears first of all; and disappears last of all the fords.

Information collectedJrom Baluchis by Lala Ihakur Dass, Supervisor. About seven miles above the place where the Harud Rud tails into the J Sdbari Hdmun, there is a good ford, called Main Shelas on the Harud Rud. „ . Ty r, L ,, ^ £ °, i . Guzar-i-Kabrdk. Most of the shelas, that are crossed, when passing round the north of the Hamun take out below this ford ; and are said to have been formed by the flood of 1885, a very few of them take out above this ford. None of these shelas are large enough to have a name. About 8 miles above Guzar-i-Kabrdk, Kuhna-i-Rud Harud takes out. This is a big shela ; the slope of its bed is not steep ; but it was not fordable at the flood time in the year 1903. In 1904, however, it had about 4 feet of water at the high est rise of the Harud Rud ; and remained fordable the whole season. The Kuhna Harud runs in a deep channel down to Kabrak. Below this it spreads out over the plain and is not distinguishable. About 7 miles above the head of Kuhna Harud, or about 23 miles above the mouth of the river in the Hdmun-i-Sdbari, a shela which separates from the Far£h Rud between Fardh and Juwain, falls into the Harud Rud. Local men call this Khush Rud, but the Mdlddrs call it Rud-i-Khdrikd. According to Meshedi ’Ali, son of Shah Noor, this shela takes out from the Far&amp;h Rud below Tujg and falls into the Harud Rud at Dahan-i-Do, In 1903, some water flowed in this shela. Meshedi saw water flowing in it with his own eyes. But others say that the spill is down the Ju-i-Shaikh* Mahmud, whose head is near Tawisk, a village on the left bank of the Rud-i-Farah ; it irrigates the villages on the wide open plain around Kala-i*Kdh. Dr. Bellew, who passed through with the Goldsmid Mission in March 1872, says that Kala-i-Kih is irrigated by streams that take off from the Far&amp;hi Rud, and that the soil is highly saline and almost impassable when wet. In 1903 a little water came down the Rud-i-Khirfkd but in 1904 no water flowed. Only in times of extraordinary flood, such as that of 1885, does this shela get much water from the Rud-i-Far&amp;h, because its bed is very high above the channel of the Rud-i-Fardh. The bed slope of the Khush Rud is said to be great ; so much so that it is not fordable to men when in flood, if its depth is even 3 feet. The junction of the Khush Rud with the Harud Rud is called Dahan*i-Do. Above Dahin-i-Do there is only one deep channel ; and no other distributing shelas leave the Harud Rud. Fords on the Rud-i-Harud. This ford is at the place where the Harud Rud joins the Sdbari Hamiin, ^ . p, . . u , an d where the British Commissioner’s camp Guzar-i-Dahana-i-Harud. , . . ^ , r crossed on the 23rd December 1904, when going to the Kuh-i-Chako to build the Boundaryjpillars. The ford is good and remains a ford so long as the H£mun is not full, or the Rud is not running brim ful. Even when the S&amp;bari Hdmun is full the river here is fordable so long as the wind blows strongly. But when the weather is calm, the water keeps its level, and the river channel here becomes too deep for a man to cross. In this way, this ford is very dangerous for ignorant people, and some times men have been drowned here. In 1904, the river remained fordable at flood time at this place. • Some of our guides called this canal Ju-i-Shaikh Bahlor, and said there was a ziarat to this saint at Kala- i-K&amp;h. The saint had caused the canal to flow when the diggers had given up the work as hopeless. The canal even now needs no silt clearance. [C639FD] KKK6co [App. 35 - » A little above this ford and by the palas or tents of the graziers, there is another ford which appears later on, as the channel there is rather deep. Both these fords are called Guzar-i-D&amp;hanad- Guzar-i-Kabrak. Harud. Guzar-i-Kabrak is so called be cause there is a large number of graves on a Puza*i _ Dasht under which the river flows. This is not a good ford, as men and camels cannot easily cross here. The bed has sand mixed with earth, but the approaches are bad ; and it is hard for loaded camels to ascend or descend. The channel is deep and the ford is zor guzar. It is used because between Dahan-i-Rud and Guzar-i*Shand-i- Kokan, a distance of about 18 miles, there are no other fords by which to cross the river. About 6 years ago, Sahib Khdn and his men threw a tamarisk bridge across the Harud Rud near the Kabrak ford. This bridge was about 4 or 5 feet above the water that year, and it stood for 2 or 3 years, but in 1903 the flood w 7 as a big one, and the river swept away whatever remained of the bridge. At the spring time all the Mdldars from Miankangf (Jaldldb£d to Deh Dost Muhammad) go to the Atishkhana mountains, and they have to cross the Harud either at Kabrak, Shand-i-Kokan, or at Dahdn-i-Do. Therefore these fords, being the only fords on the Harud, are w 7 ell known, and much used by the people. Kokan is a Persian tribe, who have cattle and sheep. One of these men used to come for sport here, and take his Guzar-i-Sband-i kokan. supply of water from the bed of the Harud Rud. Hence this ford is called Guzar-i-Shand-i-Kokan.f This ford is better than the ford at Kabrak, as the bed is hard and the river is a little broader with easy sloping sides. But Kabrak, being a little nearer to the direct road from the Miankangi to Nar Ahu and Mada Ahu, MMdars gener ally use the ford at Kabrak. The depth of water, how'ever, is said to be the same on both the fords of Kabrak and Shand-i-Kokan. Shand-i-Kokan is well known, because the v r ater in the bed of the Harud Rud at this place is sweet. Sweet water can be Sweet water in the bed. obtained at Shand-i-Kokan and Dahana-i- Do. Everyw r here else between the mouth and Dahdna-i-Do the w : ater obtained from the bed is said to be brackish and undrinkable. At the place where the Rud-i-Khdrfkd, or Khush Rud joins the Harud, there is a ford called Guzar-i-Dahana-i-Do. The Guzar-i-Dahana-i-Do. . ,, • j.irj* river there is very broad ; and the lord is very good. In 1904, the Harud Rud remained fordable at this place the wdiole of the spring season. In 1903.it w-as not fordable on those days when the river was in flood. A man and a loaded camel can easily cross at this ford in 4 feet of w ; ater. The water at this ford in the bed of the Harud, when it is dry, is sweet. Two farsukh y or about 7 miles above Dahana*i-Do, is the ford called Shir o ^ 1. Kuhak. I here is a small hill of whitish stone here, and the grazing is abundant. The sheep and goats yield much milk, and hence the hill and the ford are both called Shir Kuhak. The ford is just like the ford at Dahdna-i*Do. This ford is about two farsukh or 7 miles above Shir Kuhak. The ford is „ .... „ just like the ford at Dahana-i-Do. When the river dries, the water in its bed gets brackish. Near this place on the left bank of the Harud there is a spring called Chashma-i-LulingiT This is said to be just like the Hurmak spring on the trade route. The water is very sweet. •It may be noticed here that the Delta of the Harud Rud is occupied by flock-owners who cultivate a very small area to melons, and millet in most years. There is excellent grazing, but the water-supply is too uncertain for cultivation. f Water thus got from be ow :be boulders in th * bsd of a dry str cam is called Ab-i-sandt ^Luling is a tamarisk.

At Puzad-Baraka and above it the ab-i-shand in the bed ot the Harud is sweet and remains always sweet. There is a village, called Kopal, belongingto Kala-i-Kah,near Puza i-Baraka. Above Kopal, on both banks of the Harud Riid, the lands are culturable. This ford is better than the ford at Puza-i-Baraka, as the river is broader. ^ .

Usual ending. Final arbitral statement on the Seistan Boundary by Colonel A. B. McMahon, C.S.I., C l.E., British Commissioner, Seistdn Arbitration Commission, dated 1st February 1905. 1. The boundary line between Persia and Afghanistan in Seistan was defined in my arbitral award of November I 9°3 as follows “ The boundary line in Seistan between Afghanistan on the east and Persia on the west should run as follows, i.e., from the Malik Siah Koh in a straight line ., to the Band-i-Kohak and thence along the • (The word ' junction ’ was used in my original f . award, and is now replaced by the more correct bed 01 the Helmand TlVer tO the point Ol term ‘ point of separation’.) separation* of its two branches, the Rud-i- Parian and Nad Ali channel. From there it should follow the bed of the Nad Ali channel into the Sikhsar and along the bed of Sikhsar to a point near Deb Yar Muhammad where the Sikhsar has been diverted towards the west in the water channel shown on the map which joins the Shela-i-Shamshiri near to Deh Hassan Kharot. The boundary line should follow the left bank of this water channel to the Shela-i-Shamshiri, leaving Deh Hassan Kharot on the east. It should then run in a straight line separating the hamlets of Deh Ali Mardan on the west from Deh Ali Jangi on east to Tappa-i-Tilai: thence in a straight line to the most western of the mounds of Tappa-i-Shaharaki; thence in a straight line to the most western mound of Tappa-i*Kurki; thence in a straight line to Shalghami; and thence in a straight line to Siah Koh, Bandan.” 2. The above award having been accepted by both Governments, I have now demarcated the boundary line by boundary pillars in strict accordance with that award. The following remarks will clearly explain the boundary line and the manner in which that line has been demarcated by pillars. [C639FD] B334 f A PP- 2 ' -i. The starting point of the boundary line is marked by a boundary pillar on the summit of Malik Siah Koh which was constructed by the Afghan-Baluchistan Boundary Commission in 1896, and is known as Boundary Pillar No. ibb ot that Commission. 4. The latitude and longitude of this and all other Seistan boundary P^J ar ^j the position of each with regard to prominent places visible from them, and all necessary particulars of their size and construction are fully stated in the list of boundary pillars attached to this statement. The position of each boundary pillar is also clearly shown in two maps attached to this. 5. From the top of Malik Siah Koh to the Band-i-Kuhak (also called Band- i-Seistan) the straight line of boundary has been marked by 5 1 pillars. As these are all in exactly one straight line, a further description of each is unnecessary; and it suffices to say that No. 12 is on the south bank of the Shela, No. 36 on the north bank of the Sana Rud, and No. 5* on left bank of the Helmand river where the Rud-FSeistan leaves that river at the Band-i-Kuhak. Between pillars Nos. 8 and 9 and between Nos. 12 and 13 are 3 and 8 miles respectively of heavy sand through which it was not possible to demarcate the line with pillars. Besides these 51 pillars there are 16 smaller marks also exactly on the straight line. The positions and particulars of these are stated in the attached list of pillars. They bear the following numbers in that list:—13A, 14A, 15A, 16A, 17A, 18A, 18B, 18C, 21 A, 23A, 23B, 25A, 25B, 26A, 32A, 43A, but in order to prevent confusion with boundary pillars they have been shown in the map attached to this only as small black dots without numbers. 6. From the Band-i-Kuhak demarcation with pillars was unnecessary along the course of the Helmand river as far as the point of separation of the Rud-i-Parian and Nad Ali branches of that river. To mark this point pillar No. 52 has been built at a distance of 94 feet from the left, i.e. f Persian bank of the Nad Ali channel, and pillar No. 53, has been built at a distance of 65 feet from the right or Afghan bank of the same channel. The boundary line thence follows the Nad Ali channel. The old ruin of Burj-i-As marks the right bank of that channel near Nad Ali and pillar No. 54 marks the right bank at the point where the Shela-i-Charakh leaves that channel. From pillar No. 54 the Nad Ali channel is known as the Sikhsar. Pillar No. 55 marks the left bank of the Sikhsar at the point where the Deh Dost Muhammad canal takes off from it, while pillar No. 56 also marks the left bank at the point where the Sikhsar again turns northwards. Pillar No. 57 has been built on a prominent mound called Tappa-i-Sikhsar which is situated at a distance of 240 feet from the right or Afghan bank of the Sikhsar. Further north, pillar No. 58 which has been built at a distance of 109 feet from the right bank, and pillar No. 59, which is situated 20 feet from the left bank of the Sikhsar stream, mark the point where the boundary line leaves the Sikhsar as defined in my award. Pillar No. 58 is built alongside the site of Deh Yar Muhammad. That village mentioned in my award has lately been deserted and no longer exists. 7 . Further demarcation of the course of the Helmand river and the Nad Ali and the Sikhsar streams is at present impossible owing to the nature of the banks which are liable to be inundated. Moreover, further demarcation appears unneces sary at the present time, as the course of the water in those streams clearly marks the boundary. Hereafter should any of those streams dry up by reason of a change in the course of the Helmand, and cease to be water channels their course can easily be ascertained and demarcated, if necessary, with the aid of the pillars and places above described. 8. From pillar No. 59 the course of the boundary line is demarcated bv pillars Nos, 60 and 61 built on the left bank of the water channel which ioins the Shela-i-Shamshiri rear Deh Hassan Kharot. Pillar No. 62 has been built to mark this point on the south bank of the Shela-i-Shamshiri close to Deh Hassan Kharot. From here the straight line to Tappa-i-Tilai has been marked by pillars Nos. 63, 64 and 65, the last named being built on the top of Tappa-i-Tilai. ItAPPENDIX 3. CONTENTS. Thearbitral Award on the Seistan water question. Preliminary remark?—The award—Coyrring letter from the British Commissioner to the Afghan Commissioner—Covering letter from the British Commissioner to the Persian Commissioner.337 r t ? APPENDIX 3 . Arbh ral Award on the SeistAn water question, dated at Camp Kuhak on the ioth April 1905, by Colonel A. H. McMahon, C.S.L, C.I.E., British Commissioner, Seistan Arbitration Com mission. Prelim in ary rem arks. Paragraph /.-—General Sir Frederick Goldsmid, as Arbitrator between Persia and Afghanistan, was called upon to settle the question of rights to land and water of Persia and Afghanistan in Seistan. He delivered an arbitral award on both points in 1872, which was confirmed by Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and accepted by the Persian and Afghan Governments in 1873. 2. At the time of the^ above award the Helmand river had one main distributary' channel in Seistan, i.e^ the Rud-i-Seistan, at the mouth of which, in order to divert sufficient water into this Rud, was a tamarisk band knowm as the Band-i-Kohak or Band-i-Seistan. The Helmand river from thence onwards flowed in one channel past Nad Ali and along what .is now known as the Sikhsar into the Naizar and Hamun. In 1896 a large flood caused the river to burst out for itself a new main channel, which left the old one near Shahgul and is now known as the Rud-i-Parian. 3. Various disputes regarding water between Persian and Afghan Seistdn, which were caused by changes in the course of canals and in the course of the main river, have arisen since 1872. My enquiries show that these have, until recently, always been mutually and amicably settled by the responsible officials concerned on both sides, i.e,, the Governors of Seistan and Chakhansur. These officials, who thoroughly understood each other’s water requirements, have always shown great tact and skill in settling water disputes to the mutual satisfaction of both countries. 4. Unfortunately of recent years, whatever may have been the cause, and whether this was due to the changes in the course of the main stream, or to more strained relations, the amicable settlement of water difficulties has been found to be no longer possible. A series of small, and in themselves unimportant, water questions arose between 1900 and 1902, which, by reason of estranged relations, caused mutual^misunderstanding and increased ill-feeling, until matters were brought to a crisis by further disputes arising from abnormal deficiency of water in the Helmand in 1902. This led to the present reference to the arbitra tion of the British Government. 5. The condition under which the present arbitration has been agreed to by the Governments of Persia and Afghanistan is that the award should be in accord ance with the terms of Sir Frederick Goldsmid’s award. 6. In framing my award I am, therefore, restricted by the above condi tion. 7. Sir Frederick Goldsmid’s award on the water question was as follows *.— u R is to be clearly understood that no works are to be carried out on either side calculated to interfere with the requisite supply of irrigation on both banks of the Helmand.” Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in his capacity as the final confirming authority of that award, further laid down in 1873, after consulting General Goldsmid, that the above clause should not be understood to apply either to existing canals, or to old or disused canals that it may be , desired to put in proper repair, nor would it interfere with the excavation of new canals, provided that the requisite supply on both banks is not diminished. 8. The above award is so definite that it is unnecessary to make any attempt to define it further, except on one particular point. This award provides that Persia has a right to a requisite supply of water for irrigation. In order to prevent future misunderstandings, it only remains to define what amount of water fairly represents a requisite supply for Persian requirements. C 639Fi&gt; C7 338 [App- 3- 9. From the careful and exhaustive measurements, observations, and en quiries made by this Mission iu Seistdn, the following facts have been clearly established :— (a) Seistan suffers more from excess than deficiency of water. Far more loss is caused by damage done to land and crops year after year, by floods, than is caused by want of water for irrigation. (b) In only very few exceptional abnormal years of low river has any question of sufficiency of water arisen in Seistan, and then Afghan Seistan has suffered equally with Persian Seistan. Moreover, questions as to the sufficiency of water only prove serious when the spring crop cultivation is concerned, when the river is at its lowest, i.e. y between the autumn and spring equinoxes, yet it has been ascertained that in only 3 out of the past 35 years has there been any serious deficiency of water in Seistan during that season. It is necessary, therefore, first to consider water requirements during the season of spring crops. Any settlement based on the requirements of that season will meet the case of the remainder of the year also. (c) After carefully calculating the normal volume of the Helmand river during the period between the autumn equinox and the spring equinox, it has been clearly ascertained that one-third of the water which now reaches Seistan at Bandar-i-Kamal Khan would amply suffice for the proper irrigation of existing cultivation in Persian Seistan, and also allow of a large future extension of that cultiva tion. This would leave a requisite supply for all Afghan require ments. 10. I therefore give the following award :— Award. Clause /.—No irrigation works are to be carried out on either side calculat ed to interfere with the requisite supply of water for irrigation on both banks of the river, but both sides have the right, within their own territories, to maintain existing canals, to open out old or disused canals, and to make new canals, from the Helmand river, provided that the supply of water requisite for irrigation on both sides is not diminished. Clause II. —The amount of w^ater requisite for irrigation of Persian lands irrigable from and below the Band-i-Kohak is one-third of the whole volume of the Helmand river which enters Seistan. Seistan, to which Sir Frederick Goldsmid’s aw r ard applies, comprises all lands on both banks of the Helmand from Bandar-i-Kamal Khan downwards. Clause III. —Persia is, therefore, entitled to one-third of the whole Helmand river calculated at the point where water is first taken off from it to irrigate lands ^ on either bank situated at or below Bandar-i-Kamal Khan. Clause IV. —Any irrigation works constructed by Afghanistan to divert water into Seistan lands, as above defined, must allow of at least one-third of the volume of the w'hole river being available for Persian use at Band-i-Kohak. • Clause V. —To enable both sides to satisfy themselves that this award is being complied with, and at the same time to avoid the necessity of fresh refer ences to the British Government and the expense of special Missions, a British officer of irrigation experience shall be permanently attached to the British Con sulate in Seistan. He will be empowered to give an opinion, when required by either party, on any case of doubt or dispute over water questions that may arise. He will, when necessary, take steps to bring the real facts of any case to the notice of the Government concerned. He will be able also to call the attention of either party to any important indications of threatening danger to their water-supply arising from natural causes or their own irrigation works*! To enable this officer properly to fulfil the functions of his office, free access shall be given to him by either side to the Helmand river and its branches and the heads of canals leading therefrom. * * i *I 7 ■ ' -r 4 i t 4 App. 3 .] 339 Clause VI. —The maintenance of the Band-i-Kohak is of great importance to the welfare of Persian Seistan. It is possible that the deepening of the river bed at and below the site of the present band may necessitate moving the band a short distance further up the river. Afghanistan should allow Persia to move this band, if necessary, and grant Persia the right to excavate the short canal required for such new band through Afghan territory to the Rud-i-Seistan. Similarly, should it become necessary for Afghanistan to move the present Shahgul band across the Rud-i-Parian somewhat lower down the stream, Persia should (as has been done before) allow Afghanistan right of way for a canal through Persian territory from that band to the Nad Ali channel. Clause VII. — It will be noted that the rights to the Helmand river, which her geographical position naturally gives to Afghanistan as owner of the upper Helmand, have been restricted to the extent stated above in favour of Persia in accordance with Sir Frederick Goldsmid’s award. It follows, therefore, that Persia has no right to alienate to any other Power the water-rights thus acquired without the consent of Afghanistan. Clause VIII. — I cannot close this award without a word of warning to both countries concerned. The past history of the Helmand river in Seistan shows that it has always been subject to sudden and important changes in its course which have from time to time diverted the whole river into a new channel and rendered useless all the then existing canal systems. Such changes are liable to occur in the future, and great care should, therefore, be exercised in the opening out of new canals, or the enlargement of old canals leading from the Helmand. Unless this is done with proper precaution, it may cause the river to divert itself entirely at such points and cause great loss to both countries. This danger applies equally to Afghanistan and Persia. Covering letter from the British Commissioner ) Seistdn Arbitration Commission, to the Afghan Commissioner, dated i6tk April igog. After compliments, —I hereby hand over to you, for delivery to His Highness the Amir, my arbitral award on the subject of water. It is written on parchment, and bears my signature. This question is considered of such importance, and such conflicting opinions regarding it are entertained by both sides, that it is hardly likely that any arbitral award, whatever it may be, will be entirely pleasing to both parties concerned. I have endeavoured to safeguard the requirements of Persia without injury to the rights of Afghanistan. The terms of the award are clearly expressed, and I do not think that they require further explanation by me. The clause relating to the possible necessity for some day moving the Band- FSeistan a short distance further up the river applies equally to the possible necessity of moving the Afghan band now near Shahgul, a short (distance) into Persian territory. The Helmand has long shown signs of taking a new course to the west of the present Rud-i-Parian towards Khadang. When it does so, the only means of filling the Nad Ali channel may be by means of a short canal through Persian territory. I sincerely hope that my award will remove future dangers of disputes and ill-feeling regarding water between the people of Afghanistan and Persia in Seistan. Water questions, however small, are apt to give rise to excitement and ill-feeling, and, as you know from your long experience of these matters, the only way of settling them satisfactorily is to do so in the mutual and amicable spirit which has characterised the settlement of past disputes for many years, and, until quite recently, between yourself and the Persian Governor of Seistan. I have every hope that the same good spirit will continue to be shown on both sides in future in Seistan. The presence in Seistan of an impartial officer of experience in water ques tions, as provided in my award, is very desirable in order to prevent small ques tions’being made, through mischievous misrepresentations and exaggeration into34 ° [App. 3 - questions of fictitious importance. As an instance of this, I need only remind you of how the Persian Government were informed last year that the Ju-i-Sultani was taking off all the water of the Helmand, whereas I was able to inform the Persian Government, as you know, that the said canal was only taking the ordinary and proper amount of water. I trust that this award will prove acceptable to His Highness the Amir.

HISTORICAL NOTE TO ACCOMPANY GENEALOGICAL TREE OF THE KAYANI DYNASTY. Note. —Yakub, who Hijra having reigned eleven years. in process of time became ruler of Seistan, was son of Lais, a coppersmith in Seistan. He conquered Khorasan, Kirman, Shiraz, Balkh and Kabul, and annexed them years. The Kayams of Seistan affirm that Yakub was in reality the descendant of Yazd-i-Jird, the last King of the Sasani dynasty. Yakub was succeeded by his to his dominions. He died of colic when on his way to invade Baghdad a second time in 26s brother Umar. He attacked Am.r Ismail, the Governor of Mawara-un-Nahr, in which invasion he (Umar) was captured and sent to Baghdad where he died in captivity. Hereigned for 23 years. Umar was succeeded by his grandson, named Tahir, son of Muhammad. After reigning for six years he was made prisoner by one of his Amirs and sent to Baghdad AfLT .v'Tzrir'““ of Ahmad, a descendant of Yakub’s daughter, became ruler of Seistan.

Ati account of the mahal of Persian Seistdn gathered by Lala Thakur Dass, Supervisor, Amir Singh, Zilladar, from those among the villagers who have some knowledge on this subject. It would appear from the traditions of such men as the Arbab Saif-ud-Din, The Shib-i-Ab brought under cultivation. M ulla Qabla Ghulam of the family, who _ _ were the Mulla of the Sur Gumbad or Gumbad-i-Mulla Shahi at Kala-i-Fath, Karbala! Muhammad, Bandbaf, whose family have built the band for some generations, that the delta now in the possession of the Persians was re-populated about the time of Malik Lutf Ali Khan, who resisted Nadir Shah’s invasion and was the defending hero at the celebrated resistance of the Kuh-i-Khwaja. The Kala-i-Fath tract had to be abandoned for some reason ; the Arbab says it was destroyed by floods, and Kundarak was built as the seat of Govern ment. The main stream then followed the Rud-i-Dali which passed the following points. South of Kuhak Fort—between Kaud and Burj-i-Sar-i-Band—west of Kakha and north of Bahramabad-i-Kayani—east of Baghak village—between Nasirabad Saiyad and Nasirabad-i-Kuragaz. The tract to the south and south-west of this river was Naizar. The cultivation upon which Kundarak was established was in the tract to the north and east which was irrigated by a big canal, probably a canalised shela, i.e. t arm of the river; this canal is the Rud-i-Hasanki or Rud-i-Asiniki (by Baluchis). The tract now watered by the Nad-i-Ali channel was a sand covered waste studded with many ruins, very like what the Sar-o-tar tract is now. The river encroached to the north and Kundarak had to be abandoned; the Kayanis built Hamzabad or Kachian in its place in A. H. 1223 (A. D. 1808) and ruled all Seistan, Persian and Afghan from there. As the river encroached towards the north and east, the lands on the south around Sihkuha were set free and ceased to be Naizar; the Sarbandis settled at Sihkuha and from here gradually extended their power over the reclaimed land. The Sharakis settled at Dashtak and the Nahruis at Burj-i-’Alamdar* now known as Kala-i-Nau and the Sanjaranis at Jahanabad. For a time the course of the Rud-i-Dali divided the Province into two natural divisions which were called Pusht-i-Ab and Shib-i-Ab; the Pusht-i-Ab tract being that which was irrigated by the Rud-i-Hasanki and peopled by the Farsiwans ; whilst the Shib-i-Ab tract comprised the inundated lands which were being reclaimed as the waters receded by the Baluchi immigrants. The power of the Kayanis gradually declined before that of the Sarbandis, who possessed themselves of some villages to the north of the Rud-i-Dali • the main stream had, however, by this time worked itself still further to the east and discharged itself into the Puzak Hamun by flowing somewhere in the direction of the present Nad-i-Ali channel.

This is the place mentioned in Dr. Bellew’s book, Indus to the Tigris. Kala-i-Kuhna, another Nahrui village to the west of Kala-i-Nau, is said to have been so named as the village was established near an old mound or fort.

This tract comprised many villages in the original Pusht-i-Ab tract which had come into possession of the Mir family such as Iskil Kasimabad, Bunjar and others as well as the Sarbandi villages of Sihkuha, VVarmal, Tuti, Chilling, Daudi, Afzalabad, and others. Since the original strongholds of the Sarbandis, Sharakis and Nahruis were in the Shib-i-Ab, their mahal was considered to be in the Shib-i-Ab division of the country, even though they acquired villages across the boundary formed by the line of the ancient Rud-i-Dali. There were of course many changes in the direction of the main stream before Some notes about the changes in direction of the it left this side of the delta; at One period mainstream. a wag eac { 1 y ear at Burj-i-Sar-i- Band to force water down the Rud-i-Hasanki, now a tamarisk weir is put in the head of the Rud-i-Hasanki to prevent it drawing the Rud-i-Seistan down its chan nel.

In making inquiries about such changes one soon realises that each observer attaches importance to those positions of the river which came most under his observation ; and it is very difficult to decide whether two men are speaking of the same, or widely different phases of the riven I he people themselves are observant and accurate, but events in the physical, like those in the political history of the country, shade off so gradually that the labour of unravelling them is immense; and is only useful as a training to understand the full import of the big changes, which, though brought about by gradual, one might say continuous movements, often develop with great suddenness and with far-reaching effect. In the time of the Sarbandis the population of the country was small and the w r ork of band making w r as much greater than it is'now, as the main stream was narrower, steeper and deeper than it has since become. Ali Khan, second son of iViir Khan, Sarbandi, therefore ordered that each Sardar should bring every able-bodied male to the w r ork as soon as the order for the annual repairs was issued. The supremacy of the Sarbandis came to an end when Mir Alam Khan of The Mahal in the time of Mir Alam Khan, Kam UTI 1\ od US PtTSinn Governor of Hashmut-ui-Muik. Seistan. Some say that he accepted the following Mahal* in Seistan. Pusht-i*Ab, the tract irrigated by the Rud-i-Hasanki, which comprised the Kayani Mahal except Bahramabad and the villages of Bunjar, Iskil, Kasimabad and others that had once belonged to the Kayanis. The Sanjarani villages were included in this Mahal. The Shahraki, as already given. The Nahrui, as already given. The Sarbandi, the villages already given less those in the Pusht-i-Ab. Others say that Mir Alam Khan anxious to thoroughly break the power of the Sarbandis would not recognise this Mahal and that there was no Mahal, called the Sarbandi Mahal, in his time, but the Sarbandi villages were called Shib-i-Ab ; they are certainly so called at this time.f It is also said that his enmity extended to all the Baluch Mahal and they were all classed as Shib-i-Ab, and thus he reverted to the Kayani distribution of Pusht-i-Ab and Shib-i-Ab as divided by the old Rud-i-Dali ; but the Mahal-i-Nahrui and Mahal i-Sharaki are still used for administrative purposes. By the time Mir Alam Khan of Kain took up the Governorship in Seistan The shares into whirh Mir Alam Khan divided labour \\ as more plentnul, and it IS Said the labour to be rendered. that he first divided out the work on the band and other public works among the Mahal on fixed shares, giving f to the Mahal-i-Pusht-i-Ab and |- to the Mahal-i-bhib-i-Ab. The Shib-i-Ab (by a private arrangement of their own perhaps) subdivided their work ; the Sarbandis taking | and the Shahrakis and Nahruis | The latter again subdivided their share, the Shahrakis taking J and the Nahruis |.

Early in the eighties Ali Khan, Saruni, recovered the lands around Karku Shah and Deh Dost Muhammad from the Nnizar. Later on these western distributaries of the river cut off villages from the area irrigated by the Rud-i-Seistan, till the present position of the main stream, known as the Rud-i-Parian, was reached in 1896. The river still shews a disposition to travel to the west and probably in a few years another parcel of land will be added to the Miankangi. f See the official list of villages in appendix 41.* * $APPENDIX 6.

The sowingof early wheat begins on the 21 st September and the sowings made up to the 21st December are consi- Spring crops. dered ear] y . after that date they are ca ll e d late sown. Early sowings of barley and adas begin about the middle of December. Opium is sown in November and December. Sowings cannot be made without water ; the land has been thoroughly desiccated by the strong hot dry winds of summer. There is never rain at this season to assist tlie sowings. The waterings to mature autumn crops end about the middle of September on the arrival of the shorter cooler days. Autumn crops. The crops are harvested in October and threshed out by the end of November. Carrots and turnips are dug up from the end of November to the end of January. During this period the river* is steadily rising from its minimum by the effect of the decrease in evaporation los^« Rlver ' owing to the shorter and cooler days and longer and colder nights. The most valuable characteristic of the Helmand is the reliability of the autumn flow. In Appendix 24 the history of each year since 1877 is given, and it will be seen that the flow has never been known to fail at the sowing time 0 wheat. Winter. From the Winter Solstice (21st December) to the Spring Equinox (21st March), Nauruz or New Year’s day, a great Persian festival. This is the season for making the late sowings of wheat and sowings of barley and adas. The sowings of wheat Spring crops. usually end early in February, but at times they are extended to Nauruz even on the Helmand delta ; the Khash seldom comes down in flood till the middle or end of March, so that m the delta of the Khash the sowings of wheat as well as those of barley are usually made each year at that time. In normal years the sowings of barley extend up to the middle of March or even to Nauruz. In 1903-04 the bulk of the sowings m the Miankangi were made in February and March, because the previous autumn cron had been a heavy one and the people had no leisure or inclination to work at spring crop (Rabi) sowings till late in the season. Not only does the Helmand river receive its freshets and floods at this season, so that the canals flow full and there is ample water for irrigation if needed, but rain, and in most years snow, also falls, which provides moisture to mature the crops.^ L he ten inches of snow on the 13th January 1904 caused the demand for irrigation to cease till the beginning of March. Again m 1905 on the Rud-i-Seistdn canals large volumes of water were run to waste in January and February and crops were destroyed near Muhammadabad and Chilling. It may be noticed that no ploughings and sowings are done on rainfall in Seistan. The rainfall is never sufficient for this purpose. Some self-sown (khudrau) barley was matured on rainfall alone in an exceptiona l year like 1902-03 . the river was dry for 3 months below the Rudbar canal head, and the water did not again reach the Band-i-Seistan till about the 22nd September ; to do this it had to burst the band the r, vfcr . . R,,dbar canal head another band across the river below the Khoga canal head. A considerable volume^must comedow^Cas it reached the City nearly 30 miles from the band measured along the ^Inwrthe^ive^Mrtrd^r minimum on the 14th September (1,609 cusecs) and in 1904 on the rothAuMSt remaining at its minimum (903 cusecs) till the sgth August; by the stst September the volume was 1,228 cusecs against 1,840 cusecs on the same date in 1903. In 1905 the river reached its minimum of 300 cusecs at the end of August. [C639FD] G[App. 6 . 35 6 In some places favourably situated for the purpose the cultivators conduct water to their fields from ravines that are fed from rain that falls on the high lying bare plateaux, called locally dasht. i he areas of crops thus raised on rainfall are very small indeed. In 1904 the sowings of wheat and barley were made early, and at the end of November there was a good shower that did much good to early sown wheat. The light showers and cold weather of January and February 1905 did the crops much good. During this period the freshets come down the river due to the winter rains. These are the only rains* that normally RlTcr ‘ reach the valley of the rivers that drain into the lake of Seist&amp;n. In years of good flood the Band-i-Seistan is breached, so that it ceases to have any effect on the distribution of the supply to the Rud-i-Seistdn. Major Benn says that rain fell on the 29th October 1902 ; the first shower since 21st March 1901 and between the 1st and 15th December the Band-i- Seistdn was completely demolished. When the Mission arrived at the band in February 1903, the afflux was only two or three inches. In the year 1904 the was gapped in January and ceased to have any effect on the supply level after the 10th March. Between the 1st and 10th March the volume rises suddenly due to the combined effect of the February rains and the snow melted by the warmer days. In the year 1905 good rain fell in Seistdn at the end of November, and at the same time general rain fell over the Helmand valley and extended into India, but in December and January there were no good falls of rain. At the end of January there was great cold and the river during January and February was un usually low and the band remained intact, except for a small breach that occurred during a small fresh in February. The band was breached by a sudden flood of 15,216 cusecs on the 20th March 1905. The volume of the river soon fell and did not rise again till the end of April. The maximum volume, only 16,853 cusecs, occurred from the 4th to 7th of May. The damage done to the band this year could only have been slight. SPRING SEASON. From Spring Equinox (21st March) to Summer Solstice (21st June).

About the first of May the harvest of barley begins and about the 1 sth May that of wheat ; both wheat and barley are harvested by the middle of june In abnormally cold or cool years like 1902-03 and 1904-05 the harvests were three weeks and a fortnight late respectively. It is a defect in the Helmand river that the noods come in April and May before the corn is harvested.

The flood is at its height Riyer&lt; about the end of April and begins to sub side about the end of the first or second week in May. The volume of the river falls steadily after the floods have passed away and continues to dwindle till the minimum river is reached. In 1903 the maximum flood was on the 1st May (70,000 cusecs) and by the 21 st June the river had fallen to 13,650 cuSecs. The people say that the river becomes fordable at the gathering in of the harvest, and in 1903 the harvest was about three weeks late. The river did not become fordable till the first week of July. In 1904 the maximum flood was on the 13th April (27,000 cusecs) ; by the 31st June the river had fallen to 5,834 cusecs.’ SUMMER SEASON. From the Summer Solstice {21st June) to the Autumn Equinox (21st Septem ber.) Autumn crept. Late sowings of maize and melons and sowings of mash, til, carrots and turnips are made. The autumn crops have to be matured. Water melons ripen at the end of June or early in July. Grapes become plentiful about the end of July. The Sad-o-sad-o-bist ruz or the one hundred and twenty days’ wind blows during this season. The wind usually begins about the 20th May, two months after Nauruz, a.x\&lt;\ blows to the end of August. During this time it blows almost continuously, in years of exceptionally strong wind like that of 1904, the breaks only lasting a few hours till the end of August when the breaks get longer and the wind blows on a few days only in September. In 1903 the wind did not set in properly till the middle of July and had blown itself out about the middle of September. During this period the thrashing of wheat and barley is vigorously carried Spring crop,. ° n \, , In most villages the produce is divided out by the middle or end of Sep tember. Though occasionally where officials are obstructive this may not be done till later. At the end of August or early in September the land is flooded, so that ploughing and sowing may begin at the Equinox. During this period the river falls steadily to its minimum about the end of River . August. The strong dry hot winds that blow must cause an enormous loss of water by evaporation. In 1903 there was ample water everywhere to mature the large areas of melons and millet that had been sown on the lands flooded by the high river in May ; even on the Rud-i-Seistan there was ample water, although nothing remain ed of the band. On the Nad-i-’Ali channel there was so much water that the Parian band was not made in 1903-04 at all; the first time it had been omitted since it was first made in 1896. In 1904 there was not sufficient water on the tail canals of the Riid-i-Seistan in the Shib-i-Ab, and on the Sikhsar and Ibrahimabad canals of the Nad-i-’Ali channel. The Persians and Afghans began the band at Shahgul and the Parian in July, but the Rud-i-Seistan band was not made till September as usual. This band is not made till the canal clearances are done ; in a year like 1904 one would have expected that all this work would have been done earlier and water got to mature autumn crops, but the Rud-i-Seistan people lay themselves out to cultivate wheat and barley, and attach but little importance to the crops of the autumn harvest. Some interesting information about the Seasons in Persia is given by Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh in Appendix 40; the Note was received after this work was set up in type.APPENDIX 7. CONTENTS.

If any village disobeys the orders of the mirab, the kadkhuda and cultiva tors are fined and the money paid to the Hashmat-ul-Mulk. At times of high supply such villages as are injuriously affected close their canals at the heads; no permission is required to do this. Some are too lazy to do it, and the State lands are ruined in consequence. A good mirab should certainly insist on this being done. Villagers can be trusted to silt clear their own canals, but in case the kad- e . u . f ... . khuda is slack the cultivators may appeal to the mirab to see that proper arrangements are made. The canals are silt cleared before the labour goes to the repairs, and in case of any change in the cultivators of the plough, it is done by the men who have reaped the harvest and not by those who are about to sow. Canal repairs like band repairs are of course only done by the ghami cultivators. The only exception is the Rud-i-Hasanki silt clearance this year on which all the beghami cultivators also worked. Any road that the Hashmat-ul-Mulk considers important must be bridged The bridging Of road.. where k crosses the canals, and the mirab sees that the kadkhudas do not neglect these bridges. Influential people see that the road from their village to the City is properly bridged. It is surprising how quickly these bridges are re-made when carried away and just as surprising how others are neglected. Canals in the Miankangf are managed in the same way as those on the The Miankangi canals. Rud-l-SeiStan. There are three main systems—first, the Deh Dost Muhammad canal that takes out below Burji-i*As, where the old Helmand bifurcates into several chan nels. This canal irrigates the lands of which Dost Muhammad, Saruni, is kad- khuda; his father, Ali Khan, was the first to reclaim lands in the warshufti of the Mianxangi, and the son is the leading man on the irrigation system. Second, the Deh Siadak and Jahanabad canal system ; also known as the Lakh- shak. This canal has had several wicissitudes since the Parian channel formed. It vas at one time fed by a channel from above the Parian band at Shahcrul it can also be fed from the tail of the Nad-i-’Ali channel at the same place as the Deh Dost Muhammad canal. But at this place the canal has a great draw and the Persians and Afghans have agreed to feed it from a point above Burj-i-As! Even at this point its head must be controlled by tamarisk to moderate the supply it draws. 1 he Afghans and the Persians up to 1898 used to arrano- e these details amicably between themselves, but of late years the control of the Lakhshak has been a subject of friction. , T ^ e w f ter of the Nad-i-’Ali channel at low river has for years been divided half and half between the Afghans and Persians, and careful observations made shew that it was so divided all the time the Mission was in Seistan The Lakh shak system of canals is under Khan Jan Khan, Sanjarani, who has a Ion- term contract for the collection of the Government revenue in the tract irrigated The third series of canals take out from the Parian near Deh Hail anH irrigate Deh Khamak, Shaikh Waisi, Pulgi, Takht-i-Shah, etc J tzu gen( : raJ administration of these canals was carried out by Malik Gulzar Khan, kayam ; and since his death in June 1903 no one seems to have general c arge of them. But Sultan Mir Husain Arab has great influence in this district and probably he, or one of his nominees, supervises the system. Some 6 or 8 years ago the silt* was cleared from the bed of the Rud-i-Seis- Silt clearance and ia«&lt;i-making. tan from the head to Burj-i-Sar-i-Band The Rud-i-Hasanki is also cleared * * * *~ . 75 &gt; App. 7 .] f. ns - 361 in 3 or 4 years; it was cleared in I9°4i ^h e beghanii cuitivators being turned out as well as the ghami ones ; this is very unusual. Works of silt clearance in the Shib-i-Ab are distributed by the Bandbaf among the villages called out, and in the Pusht-i-Ab by some one deputed for this purpose by the mirab. A reach is chosen for the day’s work and all the villages work at that reach being given a length proportional to the number of ploughs in the village. No measurements are made, but each village must finish its task that day and be ready to go on to the task appointed for the next day. This insures that each village has a like share of deep silt and shallow silt. Work on embankments is given out in the same way. No baskets are ever used * nor is the use of the bullock scoop known ; the men are arranged in lifts and all earth is thrown by the tisha from lift to lift. As a result silt lies high on the spoil bank ; and borrow pits for embankments are made at the toe of the em bankments themselves, whilst the slopes of the banks are about 1 in 1 or less. All this is done to save distance in the throw. The earth in Seistan is of such a remarkable good mixture of clay and sand that a bank seldom or never slides down into a borrow pit ; doubtless tbe Seistani noticed this property and saved labour accordingly. Banks that are meant to withstand water or wind action are pitched by burying tamarisk in them in layers just as is done in the Punjab on the inundation canals of Multan. It is said that in silt clearances the bed width is tested by a rod or stick and that the length of the stick is reduced as the silt clearances progress towards the tail. I his stick is wielded by a pishkar or assistant appointed by the mirab in the Shib-i-Ab ; as already said, this is the Bandbaf. The bed slope is some times tested by allowing a small flow of water down the bed. But they usually trust their instinct or observation for this. The mirab usually inspects the work before water is admitted. Sardar Purdil Khan has had some difficult engineering problems to negotiate Same big works on the Rud-i-Seistan. ^ B tld-l-Seistan. In 1 898 he turned # the Rud from its old channel near Ahabad into a new channel in the lands of Kimak and Dashtak by which he secured an assured supply to the villages of the Shib-bAb, though he put much good land in Kimak and Dashtak under water, but this was not a serious matter as the cultivators could remove to the lands brought under the better supply. ’ In 1903 the Rud-i-Seistan developed a tendency to breach its right bank near Khamak, the water passing in large volumes by Kundarak to the escape at Afzalabad. Two or three attempts to prevent this were only partially successful • so in 1904 Sardar Purdil Khan cut a diversion for the Rud as well as buildim-eml bankments. The work stood the test of the floods of 1905. But these 'were light and there are signs that the Rud-i-Seistan has now a command of level over {his low ground, and if not carefully watched, will develop a channel down it to the detriment of the villages of the Shib-i-Ab. This may lead to a band beinc* required at this place to prevent the water going down the escape and forcing it in^ to the canals of the Shib-i-Ab. There is only a small quantity of tamarisl? near the site, so the band will be difficult to make. In 1904 a new canal was made for Deh Dargi at the tail of Rud-i-Hasanki, Making a new canal for Deh Dargi. because it did not get 3 fair share of the water from the canal that supplied Deh Dargi, Deh Arbab, Deh Shaitan and Deh Kala-i-Nau. The kadkhuda applied to the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, giving at the same time a shir ini of 300 krdn ; there upon the Governor ordered the mirab to turn out the hashar of the Pusht-i-Ab Mahal to dig the canal. The kadkhuda also spent 120 krdn on entertaining the kadkhudas who came with the labour to tea and sherbat in the Persian fashion. But had he not been in favour and his shirini been accepted, he would have had to pay the labour and had considerable difficulty in persuading it to come to his work. The mirab with the assistance of the pakar chose the line small marks of earth being placed to shew where the canal was to go. They studied the dimensions of neighbouring canals that irrigated land for the same number of ploughs and thus arrived at the size of the canal that they required.363 APPENDIX 8 . vide Chapter XIV, page 97, The Bandbdf. The Bandbaf Muhammad, a man of about 50 years of age, says that he has heard his father say that Jafar* his great grandfather learnt the art of hand- making from a Khalifa-i-Rumi or Turkish expert. Muhammad’s taifa is called Audi, i.e. } Ah deh or the distributor of water. The family were employed on the bcind that used to be made at the end of the Traku channel when the Reis iamilyf ruled at Hauzdar and Kala-i*Reis (Macchi) He says that the regu lator was made of brick and the openings were adjusted to the sizes of the canals ; a very small masonry regulator has been found near Gird Kalat by Mr. Tate, but there are no minor openings in it such as the Bandbaf describes. &gt; When the Hauzdar tract went out of cultivation Jafar, the head cf the family, came to Sihkuha with Mir Kuchak Khan, Sarbandi.J Mulla Akbar, son of Jafar, the contemporary of Mir Khan, Sarbandi, was carried away by the current and drowned when building a hand near the present village of Shahrak. Since then the Sarbandi Chief has always been a friend and patron of the Bandb&amp;f. Sardar Muhammad Raza Khan gave Ghulam Ali culti vation at Deh luti, which was in the Naizar where tut (bulrush) grew ; now of course nogrows within 15 or 20 miles of Deh Tuti. Akbar is now too old - to work on ihe band, so that Muhammad, who has no children, trains his nephews. Muhammad began to work on the band in the time of Kadkhuda Abbas Rahan, a celebrated njan.who was brought to Seistanby Muzaffar-ud-Daula (about 1866). The papers which the family had from the Reis and the Sarbandis were taken by Mir Alam Khan, Hashmat-ul-Mulk, saying that he would give them papers that would establish their claim to the post of Bandbaf for ever : so it F has come about that, like many other families in Seist^n, they have now no papers. The family is paid 2 \ man Seist&amp;ni of grain from each plough in all the the Shih-i-Ab Mahal, as these are under the influence of the Sarbandi Chief. To some villages he sends a man to accompany the Sar Mashrif and to collect Jiis , dues, and jmothers he sells a contract to some one in the village ; a good deal of the grain is thus paid away in collecting it. The Governor also allows him 300 Seist^ni man of barley from his own grain. At one time the family were allowed a free plough of cultivation, but this has been withdrawn and this allowance given instead, thus effecting ’« saving of some 6 to 7 kharwar of grain to the Governor. The Amir, Alam Khan, the father of the present Governor, gave the Bandb^f a khilat each year when the work was done ; this is now seldom given ; both these reductions in emolu ments tend to show that the work is not so difficult and anxious as it was, and bears out what^Muhammad says, as will be explained further on in the note. t From what the Bandbaf and one of the Reis family, which still survives say this was about A. D 1770. X In the time of Sardar Ali Khan, Sarbandi, 5 Seistani man per plough wasgtvec and the Government share of the produce of one plough Seistan ; this would amount to some 5.000 Seistdni man of, grain, or the whole produce of a very strong plough of cultiva&gt; tion, but the difficulty of collecting the grain robs it of much of its value. The Bandbdf h as no difficulty in collecting the grain from the Sarbandi villages in * Genealogical tree of the Bandbiif family, who now live at Deh Tuti.

[C639FD]364 Opp- 8 - Sardar Purdil Khan each year shows his appreciation of^ Muhammad’s work by giving him a substantial present when the band is closed in ; moreover, to add to the authority of the Bandbaf, he is distinguished from the workers on the band by having his meals with the Sarbandi Chief, and eating from the same dish so long as they live together at the huts at Kuhak.. Apparently on the completion o) the Band Sardar Purdil Khan visits the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, and presents him with shivini worth some 30 or 100 tuman for being allowed the distinction and honour of making the band. 1 he Hashmat in return congratu* lates him on his success and gives him a khilat. The Bandbaf says that^ this ceremony is always performed,. The Bandoaf thinks the post of Sardar in charge ot the work is a source of profit, by the cash recovered from those who do not attend ; but this is not the general impression among the people of tne country. The Bandbaf has much interesting information to give of the former sites of the band. When the main stream went down History of some Of the previous band. ^ ^ channel Mir Khan, Sarbandi, moved the site of the band from Shahrak to Sarrak, a site below the present Kuhak fort, where the Bandbaf’s father found a hard sound bed in the river. The trace of the old channel from this site to Shahrak can still be followed by those who remember it; to whom this site is also known as Band-i-Muhammad Raza Khan, as he for years renewed the band at Sarrak. His son, Sardar Ali Khan, moved the to the Kuhak fort, the channel from the older site ' having silted up, so that at flood time the water overflowed the banks of the channel and did damage in the lands of the newly established villages. The Bandbaf says, in order to find the best site for the band, 11 canals were made and the canal which drew best was chosen as the cut by which to lead the water. This* canal was dug by the Kadkhuda Ghulam Raza, Kakha.f The Kakhas are by tradition the 6tf?2d?-builders from the most ancient times, and it is believed among the people that one of the family has always been present as a leader on all b ind built on the lower Helmand for the irrigation of Seistan. ' The tamarisk foundations (bun-i band) \ oiiKxs band were washtA away in the Sal-i-barf and the new band was made at a short distance upstream of the old. The following autumn faj Muhammad Khan escaped from Teheran and passing through Seistan burnt the band. The Amir Alam Khan came in pursuit from Kain and found the inundations out, so that he had to cross the Sar-i*Shela at the Rah-i-Gardan Reg near Gumbad-i-Liddi. The year was cold and the floods were unusual, and although the Amir collected all his men and employed his soldiers to carry tamarisk from the thickets near Shahristan-i-Kuhna, yet he was not able to complete the band and many villages were not able to irrigate their crops. The next year no success was obtained with the work till the Hashmat- ul-Mulk released Kadkhuda Ghulam Raza Khan, Kakha, whom he had imprisoned at Kain for taking too active an interest in the fortunes of the Sarbandis. The Kadkhuda rose to the occasion and backed up by the Governor turned out every able-bodied man in Seistan, and cleared the silt from the upper reaches of the Riid-i-Seistan to lower its* bed. He also made a piece of new channel as a leading cut at the place where the head of the Rud-i*Seistan is now ; the site of the band being for the first time placed where it now is. The Bandbaf says the width of the leading cut was 60 feet about. ; it is now 120 feet ; and the depth was about 6 feet (one qad or man’s height). He also states that the river at Kuhak in those days was narrower, deeper and swifter. Whilst the Riid-i-Seistan had a narrower and higher bed and therefore the band took much more labour and • He was man of renown as a canal and &amp;fl«rf-builder, but he is not alive now. We unfortunately did not make the acquaintance of any K.tkha—an oversight by which ue missed much valuable information on this subject. f This event took place 30 years before Sald-barf (1877). |The Bun i-band 1 ave only been swept away cn three occasions in Muhammad’s time ; in Sal i-barf 1877, Sil-i-Nuh (1885) and in or about 1896; on each occasion they had great difficulty to build the band in the follow ing autumn, ivir. Merk was told that the band was not repaired in 1885 after the flood.App. 8 .] 3^5 a longer time* to build it. He thinks that the width was but a third of what it is now.f The depth was so deep that steps were made in the vertical bank {karod) to get to the water. Moreover, when the trenches were dug to enable the tama risk to be dovetailed into the bank, the earth had to be thrown out in three lifts. This dovetailing of the tamarisk into the banks, is called J tirg ; it is a work of cardinal importance and is carefully supervised by the Bandb&amp;f himself. It is done to make the band hold the bank and to prevent it being outflanked. At the present time the “ dovetail ” is laid in the sand of the river’s bed and a retired embankment is made across the sands to the natural ground which is now not much above the level of the band crest. Judging from what the Bandbaf, Dadi, formerly Kadkhuda-i-Kalan in Afghan Seistan, and Mazar, Bandban, say, the level of the river at Kiihak is now some 7 feet higher that it was in the later sixties or early seventies. It will be useful to study the account given of the band by Major Euan Smith, who visited the work with General ,he Goldsmid, Captains Beresford Lovett and Kij* page 281 of Volume 1, Eastern Persia. Smith and Quarter Master Sergeant Bower onthe i8th February 1872. The account is carefully written and fixes some useful details, so that it is reprinted here for ready reference. “The c/reat band across the Helmand, near Kuhak, has existed for more than fifty years but it is only within the last six or seven years that it has been so constructed by the Amir of Kain, as to completely turn the course of the river, and transvert its waters into those districts of Seistan which own Persian rule. Practically speaking, except when its waters are at flood, the natural course of the river ends at this band from which point it is made to follow the artificial channel of the canal. In former years the band used regularly to be swept away by the river every year, and a new band constructed. The Amir, however, on his arrival in Seistan, gave his attention to this point, and has expended so much care on its construction that the present ‘ Band' has now held for six § years, and will probably prove permanent. 1 he banks § This is only because these were years of very 0 f the r i v er at this point are very low, the small flood ; the Goldsmid Mission did not seem to t e itself being about 1 72 yards broad with ■ ealise that the drought was. only . passing phaM.

The present band was construct- Ed bv 2000 men in three months, all classes in Se'-stin giving their aid to a work on which their own prosperity was so much dependent. The great part of the labour was m bringing from a distance the enormous quantity of tamarisk required ; but it is said that &gt;v'ef once the branches were collected, the actual construction was performed ,n a short Ze by one man, a native of Banjar, ** the sole possessor of tins art, and who refuses to * ’ impart bis knowledge to any one but his own son. ** Deh T uti P The band still requires a small yearly repair when the spring floods are over, and its face towards the river is annually increased by a yard or more, but these repairs are now easily accomplished by fifty or sixty men. When the river is in flood its waters escape over the summit of the band and flow ,n the original channel north up to the Hainan near Chakhansur. where they are lost, and a nassage some sixty feet wide, is also cut in the band itself by which much of the violence of the pressure is mitigated. The canal is, at the point it receives the waters of the Hefmand, .50 feet wide, flowing with considerable curren ; but half its contents are drawn off by supplementary canals by the time it reaches Kimak. On the left bank of the ini.,..» s-ventv .nd even * d.,s are mentioned as the time required in the sixties and early seventie..

When the floods come down at the flower ing of the tamarisk in the spring, the river overflows both its banks, and rushes with great velocity over the band into its natural bed : and when the waters subside the natives say that great fish come to the foot ol the band, and attempt to leap o\ er it into the deeper water beyond, but being of course unable to do so, are staked in the tamarisk branches, and great numbers are caught inj this way. In the dry se tson the band is found to harbour great quantities of snakes who breed inside it 1 hey say that several men§ are; always bitten wuen they commence to remove the branches for the annual repairs/' There seems to be no difficulty in obtaining tamarisk each year for the band. Tamarisk materials foe making the band. I t IS Collected from both banks ; in 1903 the bulk ot the tamarisk was got within one-and-a-half or two miles of the work, but in 1^04. the thick large tamarisk ‘required for the base of the band was obtained from a distance of 3 miles below f the band near Deh Lakri. Tamarisk is a quick growing material provided the floods flow oyer the land. This they have not done near Kuhak for two vears, and this, I think, is the reason that the tamarisk growth is now very thin within 3 miles of the band ; a year or two of high floods will rectify this. Mazar, bandbdn (watchman), has a written order from the Governor, dated 11307 A. H. (about ib8o), to guard the band and the tamarisk thickets near Shahristan-i*Kuhna and to imprison any one who cuts or burns the tamarisk. There is no such care taken of the tamarisk now. This also leads to the conclu* sion that the work was greater and more tamarisk w’as used formerly than now. The Bandbaf says that the band is so made as to take at least (sic) one- The method of gauging the equal division of the ^ .^ e Supply down the Kud-i*SeiStan. •ater. It is his duty to decide when this object has been attained; he gauges the volume y wa kin£ across each channel when the bund is complete and comparing the depths and force of the two currents. If he thinks the volume in the Riid- i-Seistan, is less than half he still further staunches the band. I he chief w : ork of the Bandbaf comes when the wall of tamarisk extended Placing the bundles of tamarisk in deep water. from either bailK reaches deep Water ; each ,. ,, r bundle of tamarisk is then placed by himself The bundles are of specially selected long and strong tamarisk. The Bandbaf carries out the work, so that the end of the band which he is advancing is nctche i or indented ; he throws each bundle, so that it is gripped in a notch and at the same time he forces the thick end down to the bed of the river. In this way each bundle is held fast and cannot be carried away by the current. 1 he Bandbaf says that the object of providing the weak place for the band to breach as far away from the head of the Rud-i-Seistan as possible is to avoid the silting up of the head channel of the Rud, which would happen if the main stream was drawn near the head by a break in the left side of the band. He says that in 1904 a narrow deep channel had developed on the left side which he careiuily closed with tamarisk and he hopes it won't reopen. t . T , he plans of tlie band shew that a large pool is formed in the river where the Rud-j-beistan takes out and silt is caught there that would otherwise have closed the head channel of the Rud; this is quite in accordance with sound practice in India.

Sardar Purdil Khan arrived at the band with 150 men at io a.m. The men at once began to repair the roofs of the huts. The walls did not require any repairs. That day no work was done on the band. By the night of 30th 400 men had collected. Out of these 20 men were left on cooking food for others; and 380 men brought tamarisk. During the day about 100 men came from other villages; and as they arrived they were put on clearing the head of the Rud-i-Seistan, i.e., removing rubbish and level* ling off the heaps of silt to help the flow of water into the Rud- i-Seistan. O n the 1st September all the men were put on bringing tamarisk. The volume in the river was 989 cusecs. The bundles collected by the men during the day were put on the band in the evening. The bundles collected by the men during the day were put on the band in the evening. As the tamarisk for the first 4 days was taken from the jungle near Kuhak Fort, a larger number of bundles was collected by each man; but the size of the tamarisk being small, the quantity and the weight of tamarisk collected per man per day was almost the same as that brought from the right bank of the river, where the tamarisk is long and thick. On the 6th 500 men were put to make the earthen band on the left flank of the tamarisk band. 1 he quantity of work done was 1,000 x 12 x 4 =: 48,000 cubic feet. They also made a small cut through the silt at the head of the Rud-i-Seistan to add to the flow in it. This cut was 150 X 6'0 X 2’5 which gives 2,250 cubic feet of earth work.

The pakar from the villages supervised the labour, and as they had learnt the work from the Bandbaf on the Band i-Seistan, it was not necessary t0 the Bandbaf to this work Moreover, the Band-i-Parian is not considered a very important like the Band-i-Seistan. Kadkhuda Dost Muhammad mspec e ie an , , , ^ „ ,P. - • * and Sardar Shams-ud-Din Khan of Milak used to come and give instructions about the feani-making } he had worked on the Band-i-Seistan for some years and had some knowledge of foonf-building. As a matter of fact, the band was badly ma e an gav throughout the season. Construction.—This band was made at this site for the first time. Therefore it was necessarv to dovetail the foundations into both banks. This work consisted of 80 feet long trenches (5 in number) dug on the width of the about 2'5 feet deep (the dept a n below the water surface on the date) and 5-0 feet wide. These were filled with thick and stout bundles of tamarisk rammei into trenches with force. The band was started on both banks ; and the method of working was the same as that on the Band-i-ieistan, The discharge of the Parian River at this time was low ; first they cleared silt from the head reach of the old Helmand, and then started making the band. The ting or profiles on the right bank at the end of the band were made to serve two purposes. First, they did not allow the sand to drift into the head or mouth of the old Helmand or Nad-i-Ali channel; and, in the second place, the profiles caught sand and made the right flank of the band strong. The people working on the band gave these two reasons for making the profiles. Abstract. 1, Weight of green tamarisk in Indian maunds 73,200 X ^-§ = 27,450. 2. Nothing was paid to the labour.

The distribution of the expenses and profits of a plough cultivaing Autumn Crops. Melons distribution of the expenses and profits of a plough in the important wheat and barley crop have been given in Chapter XII, page 83. It may be useful to give here rough and brief notes on the distribution of the profits and expenses of the autumn crops. About Jrd of a Seistdni man of melon seed are used to an acre of land. It may be remarked that melon seeds are eaten and barter for about their weight of grain. The produce of an acre is about 3,200 melons ; the outturn of the plough may therefore be taken at 12,800 melons on the Rud-i-Seistdn and 20,640 on the Miinkangf, because from Statement N the former will cultivate about 4 acres and the latter about 6'4 acres. The revenue on melons is assessed in cash by the sarmushrif. In the summer of 1903 each plough throughout the Miankangi was assessed at 35 kran for revenue on water melons, and in 1903 at 30 kran. On the Rud-i-Seistan the cash assessment for melons per plough varied in these two seasons from 20 to \okran. The amount is fixed after inspection of the cultivation and may be taken to be 30 kran per plough on the average. In ordinary years melons are said to sell from 30 to 40 for a kran ; but during the stay of the Mission in Seistan the price varied from 8 to 10 for a kran. An assessment of 30 kran would at these rates represent from 900 to 1,200 melons only. But the Government share of melons is said to be J of the produce, for, if a plough declines to pay the cash assessment, they must deliver J of the melons at the City of Seistan. The cash assessment is pitched lower than this; doubtless because there is no real market for melons in the height of the season, as every one connected with the land either grows or obtains melons sufficient for his con sumption. The stipulation that if the cash assessed is not paid, the melons must be delivered at the City is a device to ensure the payment of the cash, as the carriage of the Government share of the melons would be beyond tbe powers of the culti vators of the plough. It is probable that the value of melons as an asset to pay Government revenue is not more than 100 for a kran. If a bazgar cannot pay his quota of the cash assessment his badar takes his share of the Government share of the melons and pays the cash himself. It will be better therefore to consider the Government demand as J of the melons produced. The following allowances are paid from the melons at harvest:— Kadhkuda Blacksmith Carpenter Barber Mulla Mushrif Pakar Sabzwan the same share as a cultivator of the plough, say Total The hire of the ploughing bullocks is paid for with an |th share of the melons after the Government share and the expenses of cultivation have been recovered from the crop.

On the Rud-i-Seistan, where the cultivation done in the autumn crop by the plough is insignificant, allowances are only paid from the melon crop ; no allowances are, as a rule, paid from any of the other autumn crops to the artizans, mulla, kadkhuda, etc. In the Miankangf, wffiere the other autumn crops allowances are made to some extent from all crops. amount to a significant The account of the melon cultivation for the Rud-i-Seistan will then be— M elons.

Half of these melons go to the badar and half are divided among the six cultivators. Further expenses on melons are the collection of the melons to a heap for storage near the centre of the field (dakhila). Labourers are paid from 10 to 15 melons a day for this work. The carriage of the melons from the field to the home of the owner is paid for at one-tenth of the melons carried. Melons ripen at the end of June and as soon as the cash assessment has been agreed on, they are plucked as they ripen, so that it is only the balance left over in September that has to be collected and stored for consumption during the autumn and winter months. Cotton. —For the early sown cotton 2 and 2J Seistani man of seed is used and for late sown cotton 4 Seistani man to man are used. The seed is sup plied by the badar and 2 man of cotton seed may be taken as equivalent to one man of picked cotton. Cotton seed at the time of sowing is worth about 1 man 10 sir to 1 man 20 sir per kran ; at the harvest picked cotton is worth from 20 to 25 sir a kran. One man of picked cotton gives 8 sir of fibre and 32 sir of seed and husk, which are used for food for cattle. The outturn of cotton is from 33 to 66 Seistani man an acre, say, 40 Seistdni man on the average, so that the outturn of the plough on the Rud-i-Seistan, which does about one acre of cotton on the average, would be 40 man Seistdni of cotton, and in the Miankangf, where a plough does about 6 acres of cotton, 240 Seistam man. Few or no allowances are usually paid from cotton on the Rud-i-Seistan. In the Miankangf the blacksmith, carpenter, barber,/for and mulla would each receive J man Seistani; the kadkhuda 2 man or ^ man Seistani per plough in all. The hire of the ploughing bullocks is paid for by ^ of the balance of produce after the Government share and the expenses of the cultivation have been paid. No allowance (damani) is now given to the cultivators of the plough for picking the cotton. &amp; The picking is usually done on one day so as to control peculation ; the labourers employed are paid fo of the quantity of cotton picked. It is difficult to estimate what quantity of cotton would be picked by the families of the culti vators of the plough and what by hired labour. The probability is that little orrS) J App. 12 .] 381 no outside labour would be employed in the Rud*i*Seistan, whereas on the much larger areas to be picked in the Miankangi nearly all the cotton would be picked by such labour.

The climate of Seistan is one of great variety and sudden changes, which take place with curious regularity year after year. There are practically only two seasons in the year, for spring and autumn can hardly be said to exist. The transition from winter to summer, and from summer to winter, is very rapid, sometimes only a matter of a few hours. Summer sets in at any date between the end of March and the end of April, and winter begins with equal suddenness at any time between the beginning and the end of November. May and the first half of June are very hot, trying months. The temperature rises to a maximum of 117 0 in the shade, and owing to a total absence of wind at this period, swarms of mosquitoes and flying insects of all kinds come out and make life very unpleasant. At the end of May or middle of June,* the celebrated Bad-i-sad-o-bist roz * In 1904 it began on May 22nd, in 1903 on June ( I 20 days Wind) SCtS in and blows With l6th * but little cessation till the middle or end of September. It blows unceasingly for 4 or 5 days at a time, usually attaining its maximum daily velocity between midnight and 5 A.M., and again between 8 A.M. and 5 P.M. It moderates a little in the early morning and evening. After 4 or 5 days it drops a little for a day or two, only to recommence with renewed violence. It blow’s with appalling violence, reaching the maximum velocity, as recorded by the Mission anemometers, of 72 miles per hour. It blows always from one direction, a little west of north, i.e., between 3i6J°and 333!°. Whatever discomforts it may cause in the form of dust laden air, noise and so on, it is nevertheless the saving of Seistan. It not only blows aw r ay the insects and miti gates the heat, but clears the country of typhus, small-pox and other diseases so rife in the country in May and June. Without this wind the summer in Seistan would be almost unbearable, and the country would be a very unhealthy one. It stops abruptly about the middle or end of September, w 7 hen the tempera ture again begins to rise somewhat. The Bad-i-sad-o-bist roz is not felt in the mountainous country west and north-west of Seistan. It is said to be even more violent in Lash Juwain than in Seistan. It is less violent in Herat, and apparently decreases quickly in violence south of Seistan, as it is but little felt on the Nushki-Robat trade route. The Seistan summer is an absolutely cloudless one. The last clouds are tin 1904 *&gt;w a few clouds on September seen about the middle of Ma y&gt; and n0 mor e 16th, but in 1903 none were seen till November are Seen Until Septemberf. 1st. As noted above, winter sets in with great suddenness. In 1903, it changed from summer to winter in a few hours on the night of November 1st. In 1904, it did not set in till the middle of November. Cloudy weather begins about Christmas time and showers of light rain occa sionally occur during the wunter. Both in 1903 and in 1904, a snow r fall occurred in January of four to six inches, which lay on the ground for a few days. Blizzards are of frequent occurrence, from 1st January onwards to the end of March. In a blizzard on 29th March 1903, the temperature fell far below freezing, and on 29th March 1905 to 8° Fahrenheit. The cold in winter is often very severe, reaching, in 1903, a minimum }In this blizzard not only all the lakes and 0 f l2 0 on the 27th December; in IQ04 of Hamune were frozen, but also the flowing Rud-i- 0 , T 1 1 • - r 0 Seistan and Rud-i-Pariun. H on 14 th January; and in 1905 of 4 on 23rd January.^ The chief characteristic of the Seistan climate is the wind. I have already referred to the Bad-i-sad-o-bist roz, but with the exception ot a calm period in May and the beginning of June, and again from the end of September to Dec ember, winds are very prevalent. They always blow from the same quarter and C34 1 FD2 witn great violence, blowing unceasingly for 3 to 5 day sat a stretch. A strong blow is always to be expected a week or ten days after Naoroz, known as the bad*i-Naoroz. In 1905, this surpassed all previous records by reaching a velocity of 120 miles an hour on the 28th March. For over 16 hours it blew at an average velocity of over 88 miles an hour. Only in unsettled weather, and only for a short time then, does the wind leave the north, and blow from the south, south-west or south-east. This is always a sign of bad weather, and in Seistan is a very unpleasant wind at any time of the year. It never blows hard from the south. The rainfall of Seistan is very slight, and in ordinary years can hardly exceed 3 to 4 inches. A complete record of careful meteorological observations taken in Seistan in 1903, 1904, 1905 is herewith attached. The wind records present phenomena of some interest, and with them should be studied the barometer readings which, it will be seen, give evidence of an unusually small amount of variation. The barometer in Seistan gives little or no indication of coming wind, nor does the wind, notwithstanding its duration and violence, seem materially to affect the barometer. A. H.

Ali Akbar, Nahrui, made his canal from the Rud-i-Seistan and brought it along the boundary of the villages of Kaftargi and Burj-i-Sarband, then north of * Gurguri, an onomatopoetic word from the Kaftargi village, and ended it at Dahana-i- Gurguri * the old channel which ran from the breach could not be closed till the depression the 1\ud-l'OClStan into the Chah-i-Nima t filled; this is said to have taken about three months. At t hi s place he made a water-mill for himself and divided the supply into two branches. Since then and up till 1904 the Chah-i-Nima Canal irrigated from four to six ploughs of spring crops, but never less than four (say 220 acres). In 1901-Amir, Ali Akbar Khan, was displeased with Ali Akbar, Nahrui, and tried to make him a prisoner. But the Sartip, Mir Masum Khan, secured his escape from Seistan, and made over charge of the Chah-i-Nima Canal to Safar, Nahrui, who was the nazir and tahwildar of the Sartip. |p The village of Chah-i-Nima from the very first belonged to the Sartip, and he changed the kadkhudas at his pleasure. In 1903 he gave this village to Ghulam Ali Khan, who is said to belong to the Taifa-i-Ahangar (blacksmith) of Bunjar. Sardar Sharif Khan, Nahrui, was the cousin of Ghulam Ali Khan ; and as the Sartip is the son of Sardar Sharif Khan’s daughter, Ghulam Ali Khan is a relation of the Sartip’s. At the end of August 1904, before the boundary pillars were built towards The collection of labour. the Kuh-i-Malik Slab, the Sartip, who was now Deputy Governor, the Hashmat-ul- Mulk being at Tehran, ordered the Chah-i-Nima Canal to be extended. Accord ingly the Mahals of Sharaki and Nahrui first sent two men per plough for todays. After that the hashar came from the Pusht-i-Ab for 10 days at the same rate per plough ; and then the men from the Shib-i-Ab came after they had finished the repairs of the Band-i-Kuhak. From the Pusht-i-Ab all the cultivators came, even the tahwil and those belonging to saiyads, mullas and hajis ; but the bazgars of Deh Kamali and Deh Gazbar, two villages belonging to the sons of Kadkhuda Ali Murad Bandani, were exempt. These kadkhudas do much work for the Hashmat-ul-Mulk (see Chapter XLIII on Saiydds), The work on the extension of the canal was finished in 30 days, except the . tunnel under the through which the Duration oi tnc work# 111 1 i 1^ 1 1 canal had to be taken to reach the depres sion of the Chah-i-Nima, which, as will be explained further on, was made in 18 days. Before the canal was extended, it irrigated only four to six pdgdo. But in the The irrigation done by the newly extended Spring CTOp of 1904*^0 ^ irrigated^ 2 Chah-i-Nima Canal in the spring crops of 1904-05. tahwil and 20 ghami pagao in addition Ejemption of the cultivators from ghami work. tQ the former four p|oughs _ In aU 2 tahml 26 ghami pdgdo wete sown. As new land was broken, only 120 to 150 man Seistani of seed was sown per pdgdo, and instead of six cultivators only four or five worked on one plough. So that the area done per plough was only about a fourth of the usual area done by a plough in Persian Seistan. The area will be further extended in the next year. The Sartip has made a concession to the men who did this cultivation, and has given them a written order that they are exempt from all kinds of ghami for three years, including the year 1904-05 ; this exemption includes work on the Band-i*Kuhak and in the City.446 [App. 14. The grant of Chah-i-Nima Tillage to the eons of Sardar Said Khan, Nahrui. The whole of this paragraph is village talk and may or may not be a correct version of what oc curred. It is quite certain that the intrigues for these lands will go on. It is said that Sardar Said Khan, Nahrui, son of Sardar Sharif Khan, had obtained from the Shah of Persia the grant of all the villages in Mahal-i-Nahrui, but he died on his way back from Tehran in April 1905. So that early in May 1905, after the news of his death reached Seistan, Khudadad Khan, his son, went to the Yamin-i-Nizam and asked him to confirm the rights of Sardar Said Khan to his sons. The Shah was telegraphed to ; and an order was received that the sons of Sardar Said Khan should at once be given the villages of Mahal-i-Nahrui. So in the first week of May Khudadad Khan sent his own mushrif to Chah-i-Nima village and turned out the mushrif whom the Deputy Governor had appointed. On the 15th May 1905 the Deputy Governor is said to have written to Khudadad Khan that they were very close relatives, and that he expected Khudadad Khan would retain him as a partner in the Chah-i-Nima village. But if this was not acceptable, then Khudadad Khan ought to pay two thousand kran to Kadkhuda Ghulam Ali Khan, being the sum of money spent by the latter on the extension of the Chah*i-Nima Canal. To the latter part of these proposals, Khudadad Khan is said to have agreed ; but he turned Ghulam Ali Khan out of the village. The tunnel or kan on the Chah-i-Nima Canal, The length of tunnel through the dasht was about 200 feet, the top of the dasht being about 25 feet high above the bed of the canal. The soil was hard and the tunnel could not be made by the cultivators without the aid of skilled labour. So the kdn kan or kariz diggers were sent for from the city, and they made the tunnel in 18 days. When the Amir, Alam Khan, came to Seist&amp;n, he considered it advisable to . get from Neh and Bandan some experts in making kanz. bo he called these kdn kan and persuaded them to live in the City, so as to be available to dig kariz when required. These kdn kan have got lands in Neh, and when there is no work to do in Seistan, they obtain permission from the Amir and go to their homes for a short time. The Amir pays from the Government grain 3 kharwar of grain to each of Annual Un ,a*. ‘ he fou . r men every year at harvest time ; i S kran in cash and one sar-a-pd or dress. When the men bore a tunnel, they get their wages in cash in addition to the above annual gratuities. The Diwan, i.e., the Amir supplies them with the necessary tools which are Tool, supplied fren. the following (1) Kuling-i-Yaksar.—Pickaxe with one head. (2) Kuling-i-Dosar,—Pickaxe with two heads.

Two kdn kan worked with Diggers their kuling at one end, and two at the other. All the boring was done by the kdn kan, and the earth was carried away by the hashar working at either end. It was the business of the kdn kan to see that both gangs were working in the same straight line. The men carrying the earth were furnished with a saruk (Baluchi jut). Carriers Of earth. This is a piece of cloth, the two ends of which are tied on to the shoulder of a man, and the other two ends he keeps in his hands.

This tunnel was completed in 18 days. The kdn kan were paid 8 kran per day per man for the number of days they worked on the tunnel in addition to Duration of work. Wage* of labour. what they get annually. The Wwr was not paid ; but the pakar got their food either in the morning or in the evening for 18 days. So that 200 lineal feet of tunnel of this size cost 576 kran, or nearly 3 kran, a lineal foot for the labour of the kan kan alone ; this rate works out to about 7/5 kran or nearly 32 rupees a thousand cubic feet of earth removed. Digging the wells. the earth dug in the well. always bored through by But the kdn In making a kariz the wells are dug by experienced coolies.* They are supplied with pulleys (charkti), buckets (tobra) and ropes, with which they draw out the sagh or the tunnel between two wells is kan who understand how to bore in the proper direction, and how to keep the level of the bed and the top of the tunnel as re quired. When any person wishes to make a/fonz ox sagh, he applies to the Amir for the services of these kdn kan and he orders them to go and do the work. Kadkhuda AH Murad, Bandani, was a very enterprising man. He took these kdn kan with him to the west of the Sabari Hamun to make a kariz from The karez on the west bank of the Sabari Rud-i-Khurmaka for the Zamin-i-Kalak, Hamun started by these kin kan, near Ziarat Khwaja Sabari. He dug four wells from the head of the spring downward ; and 50 more wells would have brought w T ater to the Zamin-i-Kalak, but unfortunately Ali Murad got ill, he w r as brought home to Seistan and died there. His scheme has not yet been carried out. It is said that the water from that spring would, have sufficed to irrigate lands for 15 kharwar Seistani of seed or about 200 acres. The Chah-i-Nima depression used as an escape. The Chah-i-Nima depression seems to be used in years of great flood as a reservoir into which to escape the flood in the Rud-i-Seistan. h appears to have been so used about the year 1875-1880, 1885 and 1891. In 1891 the kad khuda of Kaftargi is said to have cut the band by stealth in order to save the crops of his village. The Rud-i-Seistan at that time ran past the mouth of the depression and was only kept out by a strong band. In 1891 the Rud was diverted to some distance from this band. On each occasion the whole volume of the Rud is said to have poured in, so that when water was needed for the crops it could not be obtained as the cultivators were powerless to close off the flow until the water in the depression had risen to the level of that in the Rud. The Chah-i-Nima depression holds 54 feet depth of water, as our measure ments of evaporation give a rate of about 10 feet a year (of shallow rather than such deep waters) one would not expect the water to last more than six years. But the people say that the water lasts much longer, and it is certain that the water that was received in the flood of 1891 did not finally dry up till the hot dry year of 1902. Major Benn saw water in this depression in 1901, and it was quite dry in 1903 when we first saw ;t. It is possible that the cultivators of the Chah-i- Nima Canal allowed escapage from this canal to flow into the depression and thus prolonged the life of the lake. The people say that the floods that have filled the depression have brought in silt and that its depth has been reduced by at least 10 feet. The line of a kariz\ leaving the banks of the present river about two miles above the Band-i- Seistan made in ancient times can be traced shewing that the depression w T as irrigated from the river in the past. The people say that the first modern canal was made about 60 years ago by Kadkhuda Shah Baz of Deh Baz. After each flood has dried up, the canal has been re-dug: in 1904 it was re-dug by the Deputy Governor, Mir Masum Khan, as described in this Appendix. • The gang of coolies who work with the Mn kan is called amla. In fact a gang of coolies working with a mason or any other artisan \samla, t The fact that a/Jam was brought from the south-east for this purpose shews that there was no river flowing conveniently past the north end as there is now ; some pottery was found on the wells of the kariz, bits of the broken water vessels of the excavators, and made over to the Director-General of Archaeology in Simla.

Note on the manufacture of felt in SeistAn. By Terence Keyes, Esq., His Britannic Majesty's Consul in Seistdn. Felt [namad) is manufactured in most of the villages of Seistan that are not inhabited by Baluchis, but not in sufficient quantities for the requirements of the country. With the exception of that made in Luf it is generally of poor quality, the best sorts being imported from Ispahan. The process is as follows :— A mat of the exact size of the namdah (felt) required is spread on a care fully plastered floor : this mat, or kdlib, is made of parallel strips of the outer cover of reeds sewn together at frequent intervals. The outlines of the pattern are then laid out on the kdlib in brightly dyed woollen threads, the detail being filled in by small boys. When the pattern is completed, it is sprinkled with water and the wool is spread over with a five-pronged wooden fork or kirk. W hen the wool has been evenly spread water is again sprinkled on it to make it lie down, and the kdlib with the wool is tightly rolled up. The evenness of the felt depends on the care with which this process is carried out. The kdlib is then secured with string and stamped on and pounded till the w'ool adheres together: this usually takes two days. The wool is prepared with a bow or kamdn much the same as that used in India, but with the exception that, instead of being suspended from the roof it is supported by hand. The string is struck with a short mallet or mushta instead of with a stick. All the processes, with the exception of the laying out of the main lines of the pattern and the rolling of the kdlib are carried out by boys or women. The other instruments employed are the pashm-bur or wool cutter and the saim or file for sharpening the same. The articles most commonly manufactured are the sar-kash or horse clothing including head piece, and the arak-gir (perspiration protector) or saddle namdah, both of white felt with patterns in red, blue and yellow ; long, narrow ^ strips of black felt for the sides of rooms and carpets usually of white wool with elaborate designs. Long felt coats [tappar) of an uneven and inferior , texture are also made by nomad tribes of Seistan. The price of the best felt is about 1 tumdn (ten kraii) per 20 square feet when wool is about 12 kran a Seistani man. [C639FD] R45 ° APPENDIX 16. CONTENTS. Note on Carpet-making in SeistAn.

By Terence Keyes, Esq., His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul for Kain.

The work is carried out by the women, girls and Karkkana or Kcirgah (lit. workshop) means Small boys J Several taking it in tUTtlS tO weaver’s instrument supporting the web. work at the same rug. The looms, unlike those of the kdrkhana of the villages and towns io other parts of Persia, are horizontal. The warp or shat (lit. bank), which consists of double strands of J . . white wool, is fixed at either end to a t Corruption 01 meaning woof. . , , r ^ stick called pntu^\ these putu are fixed in frames at a height of about a couple of inches above the ground. The work is commenced by weaving about three or four inches of safha (lit. side) or kindra (lit. edge) in parallel stripes of dark colours ; this woven end is one of the distinguishing marks between nomad rugs and those made on the upright frames of the fixed kdrkhana. In order to facilitate the weaving the alternate threads of the warp are lifted in the following manner; a sihpdi or tripod is fixed in the ground at the end of the carpet; this tripod supports a makri or lever, from the ends of which are suspended two sticks ; one of these, called the gala, passes alternately under and over the threads of the warp ; the second, or khali, lies over the whole of the warp, but is furnished with loops attached to those threads of the warp that pass under the gola. Two cords attached to the lever enable the woman to raise either of its ends, and thus manipulate the gola and khalz alternately. Each thread of the ivoof, called pzitu, is beaten back on to the preceding one with a long handled comb or duk (lit. spindle). The weaving of the ends is generally done by small children. As soon as the required length of safha has been woven, the knotting commences : the woman picks up two adjoining threads of the warp in the left hand, rapidly forms a knot round them with a piece of wool held in the right hand and then cuts off the ends of the wool close above the knot or “ lop When a line of knots has been made, half of the threads of the warp are lifted by means of the lever, and a thread of woof is inserted, this thread which is alw'ays of natural black wool, is then beaten back on to the line of knots ; another line of knots is then formed and so on. The woman sits on the rug moving forward as the work advances. The most critical period of the manufacture is when the knotting approaches the end; if the warp is not kept evenly stretched, the rug turns out kaj (lit. crooked), or with one end drawn tighter than the other ; this causes wrinkles to appear, and the rug very soon wears out ; the proportion of rugs that have this defect is very great. When the knotting is finished another woven end is added; the rug is then taken from the frame and the ends of the shat are tied together. In most encampments the women know one pattern by heart and never use any other, but some of them are very clever at copying. A rug of lofeet by 4, the commonest size, takes from six weeks to two months to make ; the few larger carpets which are obtainable in Seistan are made by Baliich of the Chakhansur district. There is an extraordinary uniformity in the patterns ; in fact, almost all the carpets to be seen in the country belong to one of three types. By far the commonest type is divided into three panels, each panel containing a series of diamonds one inside the other; the second diamond in each of the panels is usually white, the contrast with the dark colours of the remainder of the rug being too violent for European ideas. The lines dividing the panels and the border are dotted with rectilinear figures usually in irregular order. In the older rugs these small figures are very well formed and are the same as those found in the borders of Sarik Turkoman (of Panjdeh) and Afshar rugs ; in those made now-a-days, however, they are much rougher, generally consisting ofjm 45 2 [App. 16. of a The different colour or of a series of second commonest type of pattern diagonal stripes containing three dice figures something like the letter Z. consists of lines of diamonds, each containing a cross ; these carpets are made exclusively by the nomads inhabiting the country near Bunjar. The third type consists of a centre of camel’s wool slightly coloured with henna with one or three conventional trees running down the centre. The trees are formed of a straight line about half an inch broad with stalks at intervals of six inches, each stalk bearing a single rectilinear trefoil leaf, the pattern being generally in red and black. Camel hair centres as described above are seldom found except in a “/'i tnaz ” (lit. place of worship, prayer carpet) or bdlisht, or a carpet made for a mulla or saiyad, the reason being that the camel is looked on as a sacred animal owing to the prophet having ridden one. The prevailing colours in all Baluch rugs are three shades of dark, red ; two shades of dark blue and black ; a few minor figures occasionally being in green. The camel hair varies from a rich chestnut to a light fawn. The brick red colour or zardchak is arrived at by immersing the hanks of wool first in a decoction of willow leaves then in a decoction of a root called rodang : a maroon red zard and a dark brown red, surkh, are obtained by first steeping the wool in water mixed with a burnt clay, called pulmak ;* after the wool has been kept for six months it is again soaked in a decoction of the gum of the knanjak (the mastich) tree and then in another of the rodang root; zard dye is then finished by a bath of water mixed with the ashes of a plant called misk % while for the surkh the misk bath is preceded by a soaking in a bath of water coloured with another burnt clay called mak.

It is^said that fifteen years ago there were no vines in Seistan except at Jalala bad. Before the lands of that village were swept away a few gardens had been started in Nasratabad from cuttings obtained from the Jalalabad gardens. There are only three kinds of those grapes now cultivated—(i) Sia/i, a sweet purple grape with very few grapes on a bunch, (2) Shast-i-Arus (bride’s thumb), a long yellow grape, (3) a rough tasting large purple grape. Two other kinds have been grown from seed imported from Herat (1) and (2) Lal-i- girdana ; both small white grapes. The earliest grape to ripen, Kishmisi, was imported from Farah; the bunches are so tightly formed that the grapes are pressed out of shape. From Tan and Kain were imported the ioWowmgfakhari, long, white, early; rocha, small, white, early ; sangak, small, sweet, hard with ^ many seeds, fairly early ; and husaini, a long, small, tasteless grape. Besides grapes, a few very indifferent pomegranates, apples, mulberries and damsons are grown, the oldest fruit-tree in Seistan is said to be only 12 years old. The tallest trees are mulberries of about 15 feet and apples of about 12 feet high. It is only since the establishment of the British Consulate that the people have taken to bringing down trees from the Kainat. Two or three men made a start at Colonel Trench’s suggestion. The frosts after Nauruz are even more inimical to the planting of young trees than the bad-i-sad-o-bist ruz. Mr. Keyes had upwards of 500 seedlings and young trees (exclusive of willows), of which only about fifty, including two acacia and babul, survived the blizzard of the 29th March 1905. * *4 AS 6 APPENDIX 17 .

The Seistdni recognises three varieties {taifd) of the fly Magas (Seistdni and Baluchi) ; Magas Sufid, Magas Siah or Pat Kanak, Magas Sabz or Sabz dang. The Magas Sufid .—The variety of camel-thorn, which bears red blossoms* known to the Seistdni as khar-i-shin gar* that grows on high lying dry lands (zamin-i’khuskab) } is the favourite breeding place of this fly. Up the stem of this bush a thick white froth appears—so thick that as it melts and sinks to the ground, each bush is surrounded by a dark patch of soil made wet by the froth. From this thick white froth {kaf) the young flyf (chucha mag as) appears in great numbers, and it is then that the froth flows down the stem to the ground. In a few days the young animals get wings and fly away to a place where there is a good growth of tamarisk jungle (^«/=jungle). These flies are usually born about 45 days after Nauruz (aist March), but in 1904, a particularly warm spring, they came out in large numbers before the end of March. The rooks [garg) that arrive in large flocks in the autumn eat them, and the cold of winter destroys them, so that by the end of October their numbers are much reduced and after November none are seen. The Seistani says they die in Ghous (December). Only small numbers of the species are ever seen in the Naizar. From the bite of this fly the Seistdni attributes the following illness in horses, camels and donkeys. The horse .—The fly draws much blood when it bites. To protect the horse it is swathed in thick wraps of blanket or felt, and kept loose in an open stable where there is free movement of air, and the horse too is able to move freely and protect himself from the flies. If a horse is badly bitten, he becomes ill in five days. From the illness the lips and mucuous membrane generally become white ; the horse gets thin and dies in the winter or early spring. A Seistdni only gives his horse the lightest of work and light feeding during the sickly season. The camel when badly bitten eates less and becomes thin, but this animal does not die so quickly as the horse. Donkey .—The fly draws blood from a donkey, but not so much as from the horse, nor does the donkey suffer like a horse. But if very much bitten, they also become ill in about 30 days. The donkey, like the horse in bad cases, suffers from swellings on the chest which pass down along the body. Firing with a heated ramrod sometimes effects a cure. Cattle .—Cows that are badly bitten give less milk and being thin do not bear. Sheep and goats are believed not to be affected by the fly. Magas Sabz or pat kanak .—The breeding place of this fly is in the thick grass that grows where there is much water, but its young have not been observed appearing in the same way as those of the magas snfid. The bite of this fly is not considered to be so poisonous as that of the magas sufid t and it is believed not to cause sickness to horses, camels or donkeys. But it is thought to cause sickness to cattle who graze in the Naizar where this fly most abounds. They are most prevalent in spring and become less numerous in the hot weather and disappear when the cold comes. Magas sabz dang .—This fly is born in August (Jamadi-ul-Sahni) on the trat\ (salsolae) and taghaz (desert tamarisk) in the same way as the magas sufid is born on the khar (camel-thorn). The head of the full grown fly is a beautiful turquoise blue colour, whereas that of the magas sufid is a washed out white. The trat and taghaz only grow on lands far removed from water along the banks of the Sar-i-Shela and other parts of the inundated area that are seldom flooded. These flies are considered to be more poisonous than the others; the bite draws more blood and swellings along the lymphatics quickly follow. Horses, camels, donkeys and cattle are affected in much the same way as from the bite of the magas sufid. A horse exposed to the bite of this fly on the Sar-i-Shela in September 1903 died in two days from these swellings. The horse was exposed for six or eight days to the bite of the fly and doing hard work all the time. • Specimen sent to Botanical Gardens, Calcutta. t Specimen sent among the Zoological collection to Calcutta. \ Specimen sent to Botanical Garden*, Calcutta.

Some notes obtained from Baluchis on plants poisonous to camels. Si ah taghaz (desert tamarisk), taran and marung are camel fodders, but th l, camel has been starving and eats them greedily he is apt to die sud- Tf n gr ?f n ta S haz 13 apt to be greedily eaten under such circumstances. It so the camel s stomach does not swell, but he lies on the ground, and is not able to open his mouth properly, and is in great pain. The first thing to do is to bleed the camel by making a cut on the tail: this escape of b] oocl relieves the pain. Then one and-a-half pounds of sand mixed with 12 lbs. of water are poured down the animal’s throat. The Baluchi be lieves that the taghaz has blocked the throat and the sand and water washes the obstruction into the stomach. This remedy is only efficacious if carried out as soon as the camel becomes ill; after delay the remedy does no good. Taran* is a plant that becomes green in the spring and has no flowers and it remains more or less green all the winter. When he has eaten greedily the stomach of the camel swells; the remedy used is to put 2 lbs. of dates into 12 lbs. of boiling water and stir till the dates have dissolved. The stones are removed and the lukewarm mixture is poured down the animal’s throat. The camel is then made to move quickly. If the animal stales he will get well: if not more of the remedy must be given. Shir a kutak, or the juice extracted from tne water melon, is also used as a remedy if dates are not obtainable. This is said to be an ever green plant that grows in the bed of bar-i-bhela and has red flowers. If eaten greedily by a starving camel, it causes the stomach to swell, so that the animal dies in two or three days • the pain !s so great that he throws himself on the ground. The remedy is the same as that tor an animal suffering from a surfeit of taran. r k ' ovvn ,r l the Pun jab as lana, a salsolas.

A brief note on the revenue system in the villages along the Helmand from the Kuh-i-Khan Nashin to Rudbar by Captain F. C. Webb Ware, Political Officer, Chaghai. In this note I will describe briefly the system obtaining in the valley of the Helmand. First and foremost I would say that the lands in the Helmand valley are crown. The irrigation system in the valley consists of large irrigation canals which take out from 7 to 14 miles above the lands they cultivate. Each irrigation canal is provided with its own khan and an official termed mirab, who is assisted in his duties by a subordinate termed kotwal. From each main canal a series of minor canals take off, each of which is presided over by a kadkhuda nominated by the khan. Each kadkhuda in consultation with the khan appoints the zamindars (or kashtgir as they are termed) who cultivate the lands irrigated from his cuts and each of these kashtgir, who never does any manual work himself, appoints his own bazgar. ^ Kashtgir provide their bazgar with— (a) Tools; (b) Plough; (c) Seed; and in addition pay for the hire of the bullocks which are used for ploughing and threshing whether the bullocks are or are not the property of the bazgar. In addition to the foregoing every kashtgir is bound to give his bazgar 20 kran, termed kafshi, as pay for his labour in cleaning out canals. Distribution of the grain. The produce of each kashtgir is divided into seven equal heaps, and the * • tahwildar takes one of these shares {haft koti), and from the others collectively- 70 Garmsel man (a Garmsel man is about two seers Indian) termed haftad mam as Government revenue. The remaining grain is then heaped together and the following allowances are paid The mirab of 15 Garmsel man. The lohar of 12 Garmsel man. The sntar of 12 Garmsel man. The hajam of 5 Garmsel man. The kotwal of 5 Garmsel man. v ^ The owner of the plough oxen 2 Garmsel man per yoke of oxen for every day’s work the oxen were engaged on ploughing, etc. The remaining wheat is then divided into six equal shares and the bazgar is given one and the kashtgir the remaining five. The advantages enjoyed by the khans are as follows They are allowed the Government share on the revenue of all the lands presided over by any one of the kadkhudas they may choose. They usually cultivate all the lands irrigated by the branch channel they select themselves and they pay no kajshi to any of their kashtgir.All the labour they may stand in need of is supplied them free. Their bhoosa, firewood, grass, etc., is brought in by their bazgar free of cost of carriage. The nurab is entitled to the Government revenue on one kashtgir free. And the kadkhuda to half the Government revenue of one kashtgir free. The above system is in vogue down the valley of the Helmand as far as Khwaja Ali. From Khwaja Ali onwards to Bandar-i-Kamal Khan the revenue of most of the villages has been assigned to the Sanjarani Sardars. I would note, however, that the Sardars of these revenue free villages take only ^ of the gross produce for themselves ; they explain this by saying it has always been the custom of the country to do so. Notb^-B hoosa is valueless and kashtgir distribute it as they like, giving khans, tahwildar, etc., whatever they may be called on to do. ^ •* List of villages of the Garmser district of the Pusht-i-Rud Province in Afghan istan situated on both banks of the Helmand River.

Detailed description of the fords from Girishk to the Band-i-Seista*. Girishk 30 miles above the junction of the rivers at Kala-i-Bist, is the ford Girishk. on the Helmand on the road from Herat 10 In&lt;iij; ’ “ 4 t0 K J an ^ h ? r -, Li ^tenant Connolly* . crossed this ford on the 27th October 1830 and said the banks of the River Helmand are about one thousand yards apart; the right bank is low and sandy, but the left rocky and high ; the stream was at its lowest and stirrup deep at the ford flowing smoothly but with force in a clear stream of threef hundred and fifty yards wide. In summer the water of the Hel mand is so clear that people are liable to be deceived about its depth. Two months or so prior to Lieutenant Connolly’s crossing the Sardars lost their best gun in consequence of the drivers mistaking the depth of water at a part they attempt ed to ford. In winter the rise of the river commences as much rain falls then* in the spring it is swelled from the melting snow and is broad and of great depth. Two large crazy boats are provided, the watermen in charge being singularly ignorant how to manage them; the boats will hold forty souls and six horses ; the crossing takes 6 hours at flood time and the boats are carried three miles down stream by the current before they can be brought into the shore. Lieutenant Connolly crossed the river at night on the 27th October 1830 at a ford three-and-half miles below the fort, lead by a guide ; one baggage pony lost footing and fell, and a man, who came afterwards alone, got into difficulties. General Furrier says of this ford— u We forded the Helmand on the 28th August 1845, a quarter of an hour from the fortress. This can only be done in the three summer months ; for the rest of the year the river is so much swollen t Hazarajat ? rains and the melting snows on the mountains of the ParopamisusJ that it can only be crossed by the ferry boat which the Sardar lets to the highest bidder Captain Sanders of the Engineers crossed the ford at Girishk on the 27th June 1839 and says “ crossed the Helmand River at a ford nearly a mile above the usual ferry. The stream is barely fordable for infantry taking off their arms and accoutrements, and with a strong wind and ripple on 'the water, could not be deemed fordable at the point where the detachment crossed it. There are however, easier fords within a short distance, higher (sic) up the stream. Laden camels crossed the river with ease Its depth was about 3' 9' ; width of the widest branch 70 yards, there being two others shallower and narrower; velocity of the current three miles pe? hour. Since May 21st this river had fallen upwards of four feet. The stream was at that time crossed by rafts-made of rumkegs, rowed across by sappers.

On 3rd June 1838 Major Todd crossed the river on an elephant and the water was seven feet deep in some places. The boat had been destroyed a short time before (Journal, Asiatic Society, Volume 13, Part I, page 349 )* In October 1885 an Intelligence Party crossed this ford on its way from Quetta to join the Afghan Boundary Delimitation Commission. The dafadar in charge said that “ the Helmand had much water in it, nearly up to the horse’s back; our horses could just cross without swimming. All the men of the party went over in a boat together with one horse. The camels went over loaded. (P.g. ,,6 o( Volume VofRecoedsoMn.dll. The Hakim of Girishk sent 50 men to gence Party of Afghan Boundary Delimitation aSSISt who Stnpt and Swam. All animals Commission.) crossed without accident Colonel McMahon says that the late Amir sent boatmen to Girishk from Lalpura on the Kabul River and they built boats, so that there are now twenty boats in addition to unserviceable boats. Most of the boats are used in a boat bridge at Shorakai near Girishk. The boats are of the pattern usual on the Kabul River and carry about 300 maunds Indian. Two boats were sent down with supplies by the Amir for the Seistan Mission in January 1903, but they did not get lower down the river than Malakhan ; it is said because the boats got into a bye channel of the river and went aground. They were not seen by any of the officers of the Mission. Kh&amp;n Bahadur Mir Sham Shah says that in 1893, when he passed through Girishk, there were 60 families of boatmen living on the east bank of the river opposite Girishk at the village of Deh Ab Bazan, who said they were brought there by Nadir Shah. There are about 40 boatmen in the service of the Amir, who get one-third of the ferry dues received. He also says a temporary bridge is built early in the autumn at Babaji m . .. between Girishk and Kala*i-Bist. The Temporary bridge at Babaii. .... , r , • r „ . bridge is made of gabions of tamansk, filled with boulders, placed side by side in pairs and spaced a short distance apart. Long poles of padah or tamarisk are used as a platform. The construction is similar to that adopted for making, the Band-i-Puz Mashi, butthe groups of gabions are placed further apart so as to obstruct the water way as little as possible. Kala-i-Bist is above the junction of the rivers Helmand and the Arghand- Kaia-i.Bist a k’ or Tarnak, as the branch, which brings down the combined waters of the Arghandab, Tarnak, Arghastan and Dori, seems to be variously called. Dr. Bellow* says—“ The river is from 250 to 300 yards wide between » From Indus to Tigris, by Dr. H. w. Beiiew, straight banks about twenty feet high; c * s - 1, but the stream at this season (20th February 1872) is only about eighty or ninety yards wide over a pebbly bed. It was forded at several places opposite our camp by horsemen going across in search of fodder. The water reached the saddle and flowed in a clear gentle stream.” This ford was about 3 miles above the junction of the Arghandab which Dr. Bellew says was then 40 yards wide and 2 feet deep, flowing in a turbid stream on a sandy bottom. This would give a discharge of about 270 cusecs (120 feet wide, 15 mean depth, i'5 feet a second mean velocity), which is small for a turbid stream. At Girishk Lieutenant Connolly thought the river 1,000 yards wide, while 30 miles lower down Dr. Bellew thought it 300 yards wide. Nothing is more difficult to estimate by the eye than the width and depth of streams or ^he heights of their banks.^ These unusual physical objects strike the imagination and the judgment is mislead ; such objects should always be measured, however roughly. If the estimate by eye is written down first and the measurement made afterwards, it will be seen how difficult it is to estimate by eye.App. 21.] 471 The Arbab Saif ud-din, an old and observant man, who has been up the Helmand to Kandahar, says that at Kala-i-Bist, which is on the left bank of the Helmand and the right bank of the Arghandab, there are two fords above the junction and one ford below the junction. The ford opposite the central tower of the fort of Kala-i-Bist which leads to Aeenak (Ahinak) on the right bank of the river, a little below Kala-i-Bist, is a very good one; there are boulders in the river bed at this ford. The river channel remains always at the same place ; there are no trees on the banks, but a luxuriant growth of the grass Ajrak or Aeres* He describes the following fords between Kala-i-Bist and Kuh-i-Khan Nishin ; two other guides have also been up the river and the information is the result of comparing the notes. It cannot be guaranteed and needs to be checked by trained observers. Guzar-Akinak or Aeenak is a very good ford opposite the west end of the tower at Kala-i-Bist. Gitzar-i-Gorgi opposite Deh Gorgi, one of three small villages belonging to the Barakzai. Guzar-i'-Khusrabad, a good ford. Guzar-i-Khalach a good ford; the river flows under the left bank from Kala-i-Bist to Hazarjuft and the cultivation is on the right bank. Guzar-i-Zarist, a very good ford opposite a village; the canal has good command. This is probably the ford Dr. Bellew calls Gudar-i-Barhana, which he says is halfway between Kala-i-Bist and Hazarjuft, opposite the highly cultivated district of Zaras. Zaras is 9 miles below Kala-i-Bist and 16 miles above Hazar juft by the map. Guzar-i-Surkh Doz, a good ford. Guzar-i-Hazorjuft, a very good ford, but is said to appear late. Hazarjuft is on the left bank and the road goes to Surkh Doz and Shamalan. The direct road from Kandahar and Kala-i-Bist across the Dasht returns to the river here. The guides say that Hazarjuft is 2 miles upstream of Shamalan, and Karkuh and Shamalan are nearly opposite each other and not as shown on the 16 miles to the inch map. Guzar-i-Shamalan. —This is called Guzar-i-Badshahi and appears first of the fords in this vicinity. It is used by caravans, it lies between Shamalan on the right bank and Kharako on the left bank. Shamalan is 25 miles below Kala- i-Bist. General Perrier mentions having used this ford on the 25th September 1845 when travelling up the valley. Guzar-i-Darwcshan-i~Ka!an a very good ford but appears late. The village belongs to Katal Khan, son of Sardar Khan, Gorazai. Gnzar-i-Darweshan Khurd, a very good ford on the road to Shamalan at a village of many gardens belonging to VVali Muhammad Khan, son of Dad Muhammad, Lalazai. Guzar-i-Mzan Pushta, a good ford on a road to the Dasht-i-Margo at a village of 400 families. Guzar-i-Mian Pushta Kalan. —The river here flows under the right cliff, and there is no cultivation on that bank. The village has about 800 families and belongs to Sherdil Khan, Alezai. Guzar-PLakhi, opposite a large village of 100 families belonging to Aslam Khan, Alezai. Kutaba-i-Khurd is said to be a small village of only 5 or 10 “ Kulba ” of land on the right bank built a few years ago. Guzar-i-Safar, a large village of 2,000 families belonging to Salar Kh&amp;n, Kanozai. There is no cultivation on the right bank. Guzar’PBinaiar-i-Sar between the ruins of Shahr-i-Khwaja Sultan and Binadar-i-Sar, the village belonging to Wazir Khan. Guzar-PBinadar-i-Minjeen. —This village is called Binadar Sala Khdn and belongs to Aziz Khan, son of Makran Khan. [C639FD] z nr47 2 [App, 21. « * Guzar-i’Diwalak or Binadar-i-Pae. The ford is between Binadar-i-Pae on the left bank and Diwalak on the right bank; it is said to be glo-sang {glo, a melon ; sang, a stone) ; that it has boulders on the bed. The cultivation on the right.bank begins at Diwalak and extends to Pae-Gil-i-Malakhan. C 5 O Guzar-i-Bakat .—The village belongs to Ghulam Khan, Popalzai. The Arbab says that the fords are at Rung or rapids on the river, and, at most of the fords, water-mills have been built, the head race being situated above the ford and the tail race below; the head and tail race aggregate one mile, or a mile and-a-half, and the drop through the mill is about 3 feet. On the 1st February 1903 the camp of that part of the Mission that crossed , . the Registan by the routes which reach Lanai Wala Muhammad Amin. . . ^ rr i • ivi ' i • the river above the Kuh-i-Khan INishin was pitched in the cultivation of band! Wala Muhammad, between the canal and the river near a big fixed sand hill that overlooked a ford in the river. The road over this ford led to the big highly cultivated village of Khan Nishin on the right bank belonging to Muhammad Buner Khan, Sagozai. The ford is at a sudden bend of the river, the left being the concave bank ; above the bend the river had divided into two channels and the main stream was then in the left channel which under-cut the left bank, so that the descent to the ford was down a cliff, 15 feet high, which had been roughly scarped. The ford* is at a bar of boulders; the crossing ascended the glacis of the bar and reached the far bank near its crest; a low permanent island, with a growth of tamarisk on it, had then to be crossed to the smaller arm of the river which was about 50 yards wide and 3 feet deep; the path then led across the river bed which was then dry, but had been about 2 feet deep under water at a recent flood. The river during this flood could not have been fordable for loaded camels. The transport camels crossed the ford and brought back supplies of grain and bhusa (chaff). It was an easy ford to ride across; though the current was strong, the ford was good, as the bottom was hard and very even. The Arbab Saif-ud-din calls this ford Guzar^i-Khan Nishin, and says that it is Guzar-i-Padshah and much used by caravans. He describes two fords between here and Guzar-i-Ta^haz. Guzar-i-Kala-i-Nan, a good ford at the large village belonging to Mir Afzal Khan, son of Khan Muhammad Khan, 'the cultivation along the left bank ends against the spurs of the Kuh-i-Khan Nishin, but exists on the right bank from Diwalak to Taghaz. Guzar-i-Khairabad .—The ford is good and is opposite the village which belongs to Haji Muhammad Khan. A water-mill is worked by utilising the rapid at the ford. The head race being above the ford and the tail race 'below. In about i j miles of channel a 3*0 feet fall is thus acquired. Dr. Bellew says on the 27th February 1872 they camped on the left bank of the river midway between Kala-i-Sabz Kaia-i-Sabz or Taghaz. and T a g haz, both villages on the opposite ' f bank of the river; the supplies were all brought from the cultivation on the opposite bank and the river\vas forded at many places, the water being stirrup deep and about 200 yards wide, the banks low and overgrown with tamarisk. Baluchis in Seistan' call this ford Guzar-i- Taghaz and say it is in the land of Khuda Nazar Khan, Sagzai. The cultivation on the right bank is said to end at Pae Gil-i-Mala Khan, an area of 20 ploughs that w : as cultivated in olden times. That part of the Mission that came down the Helmand from Landi Wala Mala Khan. Muhammad camped opposite the old fort . of Mala Khan.

I saw a man riding across on the 3rd February when the discharge was about 3,500 cusecs ; loaded camels could have crossed. The Baluchis in Seistan describe 3 fords at Mala Khan—Guzar-t~ Gurguri opposite Kala~i~Mala Khan, about 2 miles upstream of the old fort of Mala Khan; Guzar-i-Mala Khan at the ancient fort; Guzar-t-Dcshu or Guzar-i- Sa?igi ; this last is said to be a very good ford with boulders on the bed between the ancient fort and the village of Deshu. It is one of the Guzar-i-Badshahi. The Arbab Saif-ud din says Sardar Kuhndil Khan crossed here on his way to Teheran about A.D. 18^.0 with elephants, horses and camels. It is said to be so broad (i.e., the dimei'sion measured in the direction of the stream) a ford that an army could go over at one time. It is the best ford above Band-i-Mashi and appears 4 or 5 days before that ford. Marching from Kala-i-Sabz, Dr. Bellew camped at Mel Gudar, where there w-as a ford in a dense jungle of tamarisk and willow trees; as Mel Gudar was the same distance below Mala Khan, as Mala Khan is below Kala-i-Sabz; it must have been between Kuigi and Khwaja ’Ali; this position answers to Dr. Bellew’s description in other particulars. Baluchis in Seistan do not know this name. The Mission encamped on the river a little upstream of the ruined fort of Khwaja ’Ali. The river was fordable here during the time (4th — 10th February 1903) the Mission was in camp. The discharge of the river was 4,136 cusecs ; the maxi* mum velocity was 2'5 miles an hour (3*7 feet a second). The stream w r as about 200 yards wide at the ford and about 3 0 feet deep. It was not a good ford, as the bottom was very uneven ; it was then only fit for horsemen and not for loaded camels ; a very small rise in the river would have closed the ford. Our men crossed here to survey on the right bank of the river. Baluchis in Seistan describe two fords at Khwaja ’Ali; this one or Guzar-i- Khwaja ’Ali opposite the village of Taj Muhammad Khan, Khan Khel and Guzar-i-Pate opposite a small village of that name, which lies midway between the two villages of Kfiwaja ’Ali, v.z , that already mentioned and that of Sardar Atta Muhammad Khan, Sanjarani. They also describe the three following fords between Khwaja Ali and Landi Bahraichi. Gnzar-i-Go Kushi, —The ford opposite Puz*i-Pulalak; there is a kabristan with the tomb of Sakhi Dost Muhammad Khan, Barechi on the Puza (promon tory) on the left bank. Guzar-i-Pulalak opposite the village of that name. Guzar-i-Regan. —The ford is on the boundary or Sim-i-Landi-o-Pulalak. Regan is the name of a small piece of land on the right bank of the river. Kharif irrigation on Sailaba used only to be done, but in 1903 a small canal was made and this year (1904) some w r heat has been sown. I he place is not marked on our map. Some of the surveyors came down the right bank.of the river from Khwaja ’Ali, and crossed back again to this camp by a ford similar to that at Khwaja ’Ali. The ford is at the downstream end of the sand-hill where the band is made in the river for the Rudbar Canal. Baluchi guides in Seistan describe a ford opposite Kuhna Kalat Puza-i-Lat, called Guzar-uLat between Landi and Rudbar. The ford is opposite the village of Sardar Muhammad Reza Khan at Rudbar; it is similar to that at Khwaja Rudbar. The Mission camp was pitched near the ford, and Mr. Tate crossed the river at it, but in a boat.474 [App. 21. The Baluchi guides in Seistdn say there is a ford between Rudbar and Puz- i-Mashi near Dam-i-Sikandar under the ruin called Kala-i-Zulekha; the ford is called Guzar-i-Zulekha. All the fords on the river and its branches below the ford at Puza-i-Mashi and all the roads across the Naizar and the fords across the Sar-i-Shela have been examined by us. The position of the fords as they existed in the years 1903 to 1905 have been shewn on the sketch maps made by the irrigation party from the traverses that they made when running lines of levels. Puz-i-Mashi or Ziarat Panja Kash .—This ford is below the site of the band or weir made at the head of the Chaharburjak Canal. The big canals -which irrigated the lands on which the large ruins at and around Kala-i-Path were built took out at this site also ; these canals probably worked during the 15th, 16th, 17th and perhaps in the 18th centuries. The result of building a weir here for a long time is clearly shewn on the longitudinal section of the river by the raising of the bed of the river at this site, giving a 1 long reach of low fall above the w-eir site and a sharp fall below it. As a consequence the stream has spread out into a wude shallow stream of moderate velocity providing one of the best fords on the river ; the “ bar” gives an excellent bottom and the ford is one of the first to appear. When I was at Mashi in June 1903 the river was still discharging 15,000 cusecs, and the water was at least 5 or 6 feet deep over the ford. Camels were taken across with ease swimming. The ford is about one and-a-half miles above the ruin of Kala-i-Madar-i* Padshah. The Ziarat of Panja Kash is on the lower bluff just over the river where the road along the right bank of the river drops down from the Dasht-i- Margo on to the culturable plain. The Puz or nose refers to the bluffs of the higher cliffs further from the river; there are two such bluffs, each called Puz-i-Mashi, one upstream and the other downstream of the site of the band of that name at which the ford exists. The people of the valley consider this as good a ford as that at Chaharburjak or Bandar-i-Kamal Khan. It became ford able for camels about the first week of July 1903 when the river was discharging 8,000 cusecs; it ceased to be fordable on the 10th March 1904 when the river rose suddenly from 6,617 cusecs to 11,604 cusecs ; it became fordable again at the end of May when the discharge fell to 9,000 cusecs. It would, therefore, seem that a ford exists here for loaded camels so long, as the river is not dis charging more than 8,000 cusecs. Major Maitland describes a ford, called Knkro, above Kala-i-Madar-i-Pad- shah which the Russo-Afghan Boundary Commission were to have used but did not. (Vide page 61 of the Intelligence Branch Records of that Mission.) This name is not now applied to any ford, but it is probable the Mashi ford was- referred to, as this is the only ford here good enough for so large a caravan to cross. The Baluchis say Kukro is a tamarisk thicket in which cattle thieves may lie concealed. The thick tamarisk on the right bank of the river opposite Kala-i-Madar-i-Padshah is called Kukro. Guzar-i-Khaio between Deh Khajo and Kala-i-Ashkinak, both on the right bank, not a good ford. Major Maitland at page 61 of Volume l of Records of Afghan Boundary Delimitation Commission of 1884 says that the ford appeared for the first time in 1884. Captain Peacock crossed by it. It was not a good ford. Guzar-i-Husainabad, the ford is now on a direct line between Kala-i-Hus- ainabad on the right edge of the river and Kala-i-Chilmarez on the low dasht on the left bank. This is a very good ford and is much used by k a jit a taking grain from this small piece of cultivation to the Sarhad. On 20th June I was told that a loaded kajila had crossed here about the 25th June when the river was dis charging about 12,000 cusecs. I cannot be sure that this was correct. The ford is said to become fordable at about the same time as the Guzar-i-Mashi above described, and in that case it should not have been fordable for loaded animals for nearly a fortnight later. Guzar-i-Londo and Gusar-i-Manai t the first above and the second below Kala-i-Husainabad are not good fords. Chaharburjak .—The river spreads out here and is usually forded in two places both with hard bottom. There are tw r o good fords, each over rapids—one is now a mile above the village, and the other three miles and a half lower down, opposite the place where the Naib’s garden, till washed aw 7 ay, was, - it 4 ?475 App. 21.] hence the ford is called Guzar-i-Bagh-i-Naib or Nasir; but the upper ford is very * The largest stones measured 6'' to long and much better than the loWCT, The bed IS of were io' in circumference. large gravel* Or shingle. The upper ford was easily fordable when the Mission were in camp here on the 13th February 1903, when the river volume was about 5,000 cusecs. Mr. Johns, Executive Engineer, marched up from the Band-i-Seistan and crossed here with loaded camels on the 13th February 1903, when the volume in the river was about 8,000 cusecs. He tried all the fords below, but none were fordable. It was not fordable for loaded camels when I passed at the end of June 1903 the river discharge was 11,000 to 12,000 cusecs. In the spring of 1904 it was only unfordable for horsemen at the height of the flood, but for loaded camels it remained unfordable till the end of May. These and the other fords between Dak-i-Dila and Kala-i-Madar-i-Badshah were connected to the level traverse run in September 1904, vide sketch plan on a scale of two inches to a mile No. 1-A. The Afghan Boundary Commission on the 22nd October 1884 crossed the river at the ford which was then on a line with the upstream face of the Fort {vide map at page 64 of the Records of the Intelligence Party); but it is now a mile higher upstream between the Dakma (tower of silence) on the right bank and the ruins of Chahar Shaklak on the low ^tfs^/on the left bank. In October 1884 even small mules and ponies carried their loads across. The return party crossed herein the winter of 1885-86 (27th December) and found the ford entirely altered by the great flood of April 1885 and not so good, probably there was more water flowing in the river than when they first saw it, as the ford still shares uath Bandar-i-Kamal Khan the reputation of being the best ford at this important part of the river. There are two fords between the Guzar-i-Naib and Kala Mir, a well known ruin on the right bank. Each is at a rapid, neither are much used for loaded camels, but often by riders and footmen. The upper is called Guzar-i-Karodi and is to the west or downstream of Khel*i*Sahib Khan and almost due north of Kala Roden. The lower is called Guzar-i-Kavoargi and is about a mile below the Roden ^ Fort and a mile above a Nelak (mud pillar) Guzar-i-Kawargi. .i • i ^ i i on the right bank. Karodi be it explained is a bank that is being under-cut by the river. Kawarg is a pretty creeper that produces an edible fruit. Neither of these names are likely to last. Though the Russo-Afghan Mission were told that the bare gravel plain on the right bank at this part of the river was called Dasht-i- Karodak. On 27th June 1903, I crossed my camp at this part of the river when the volume was 11,500 cusecs, but the loads had to be boated across. None of the fords had up to then appeared for loaded animals. This ford is immediately opposite the village and a little above the point 0 . T . . T . L where the Helmand leaves the gorge at Bandar-i-Kamal Khan. . i i • i i i • t i &amp; the old river bed which goes due west through the ancient southern- delta. The river having deserted this arm now turns suddenly due north and flows through the northern delta to the Hamun near Tappa-i-Kuhlak. At the ford the river spreads out in an even stream of low velocity and great width, the bottom is of big gravel, hard and excellent. I saw men with unloaded donkeys crossing here on the 29th June 1903 when the volume in the river at the band was 10,650 cusecs. The river was not fordable for loaded camels till the end of the first week of July when the discharge had fallen to about 8,000 cusecs. The river remained fordable till the 10th March when the volume rose suddenly from 6,617 t° 11,600 cusecs, and was not fordable again for loaded camels till the first of June when the volume fell below 9,000 cusecs. On the 20th March 1905 ; when the river suddenly rose to 15,216 cusecs, this ford remained fordable for men, although all the other fords up the river were not fordable to men on horseback. It w r as not of course fordable for loaded camels. This ford shares with the upper ford at Chaharburjak, the reputation of being the best and most reliable ford on the river, and is the point that kafila from Sarhad to Chakhansiir make for. The name [C639E D] AA476 [App. 21. of Bandar (Arabic for port or market town plural Banadir) has thus been given . The present ford end viling. i. exact], one to the ford. Kamal Khan, Sanjarani, built mila upsti earn of these ruins. ^ fort* hcrG WnlCn IS described by Ur« Bellew; it was much damaged in the flood of 1885 and is now deserted. Tradition says one of the great band of the Helmand was formerly built in the reach of the river between Kala-i-Kamal Khan and Kala-i-Roden. When the river bifurcated here this is certain to have been the site of a band to regu late the supply just as the Band-i-Seistan now regulates the supply at the bifur cation at Kiihak. The effect of the great flood of 1885 on this ford is described at the end of the Appendix 25 on that flood. Guzar-i-Gambad-i-Nddiri. —This is a ford, a little lower down the river, opposite the sundried brick mausoleums of that name which are built on the high plain on the left bank. It is at present a useful ford and appears soon after the Bandar ford appears. The river was easily fordable at Banjiar Kushta where the Mission camp was pitched on the left bank of the river on the 16th February 1903, near the Dak- i-Dila Canal head and a little above the village of Mirabad on the right bank. The discharge was 3,600 cusecs and the velocity 2J miles an hour (3'6 feet a second). The ford was about 700 feet wide and 3’o feet deep, with a sandy bottom, which is apt to scour, and the condition of the ford varies with every flood and freshet. My loaded camels crossed a mile and-a-half lower down the river on 19th August 1903 when the discharge was about 3,400 cusecs ; this was said by the guides to be the proper Mirabad ford. It is 7 miles below the Gambad-i- Nadiri. Guzar-i-Yakdast. —This ford is at the head of the Deh Dost Muhammad (Arbab) Canal and 15 miles below Gumbad-i-Nadiri; the bed of the river is sandy and the ford is like that at Mirabad unreliable. Gumbad-i-Yakdast is a burnt brick tomb on a low spur of the Dasht-i-Margc overlooking the cultivated valley. There are high sand-hills on the bank of the river at the ford. Guzay-i-Mastian. —This ford is near Reg-i-Ibrahim, about 3 miles up stream of Kabr-i-Haji, about 16J miles below Gumbad-i-Nadri ; it is the name of a small village on the left bank which is irrigated by a water-course from the river. It is said-to be a good ford, much used by Kala-i-Fath people and appears about 15 days after the ford at Chaharburjak. Guzar-i-Sharifa. —A good ford at a place where the river flows over gravel *, it is much used by the Kala-i-Fath people. It is called Yak Pada as a conspi cuous poplar willow (Sahx Babylonica or Populus Euphratica) stood here till the flood of 1885. It is near the ancient canal called by Dr. Bellewf Yakhdb. fPage 215 of—‘ From the Indus to the Tigris.' Guzar-i-Jalai. —The approach to the ford on the right bank is over a ridge of sand-hills which it did not seem possible to avoid ; it is considered a good ford, because there is a gravel bottom ; I crossed on the 16th August when the discharge of the river was 3,650 cusecs. The stream was strong and about 3‘5 feet deep for a width of 20 feet under the left bank and had not the bottom been hard and even loaded camels could not have crossed. The ford is between the village of Deh Dost Muhammad Arbab and Kabr-i-Haji, a Ziarat 2^ miles downstream of the head of the ancient Canal Yakhab. The ford appears about a fortnight after the ford at Chaharburjak. It became fordable to men about the 1st June J 9°4 (8,800 cusecs) and to loaded camels about the 15th June (7,000 cusecs). Guzar-i-Deh Sabz Gazi or Deh Bdjzai. —I saw this ford in use at the end of July 1904 ; it seemed a better ford than the one at Kabr-i-Haji, as the stream was spread out more evenly. The bottom was gravel and the approaches were good, but it is said to be unreliable and is seldom used for loaded* ^ * * App. 21.] 477 camels. It is 3 miles below the Jalai ford and 3J miles above the Mashi ford. Mdshi. (Near the Ziarat Padah Sultan.)—This is the ford at which the Mission camp crossed the river from the left to the right bank on the 19th . Really an ancient protection embankment* 1903 ; the ford is opposite Gulab tsmshta; a beacon on a small piece of ' Dasht,”* about 300 yards to the right of the ford. It is 6f miles below the Jalai ford at Kabr-i-Haji and eleven miles above the Band-i-Seistan. The river had spread out into a broad stream with a low sand bank in the middle ; the deeper channel was under the right bank where the water at the time the Mis sion camp crossed was 4'o feet deep ; at the take off on the left bank the water was 3 feet deep. The current throughout was gentle; the bottom was sand, and at the deep part worked up under traffic and reformed lower down, so that the ford gradually travelled downstream, making a sharp curve round which the camels had to be carefully steered or they got off this curve and into difficulties. The right bank was high and steep and had to be scarped or ramped ; trangar or nets made of stout rope in which miscellaneous bundles are carried on camels, were spread out on the ramp, to make a firm landing for the dripping cames, when leaving the water. It may be noticed here that nowhere on the Helmand are the banks at the crossing of the rivers or canals artificially ramped ; the rough slopes worn down by traffic is all that can be expected. If a canal cuts off a homestead from its land, the cultivators will build a rough bridge or make a rough ramp. But through roads used only by travellers are seldom provided for. The same thing used to obtain in India ; unless the road was important enough to attract the notice of the Provincial Government, it was often unbridged, as the natives only draw attention to roads that cut off their homesteads from their lands. It is, therefore, essential in marching in a country intersected by channels like Seistan to have a party of beldars in advance to ramp the road and save the camels from falls and the loads from damage. On the 1st March Mr. Johns tried to cross here when the discharge had risen from the 3,600 cusecs of the 19th February to 4,100 cusecs and was rising, and he was unable to do so. He went up the river trying all the fords and finally crossed at Chaharburjak about the 7th March when the volume of the river was probablyf 8,000 cusecs. In July 1904 we found that a new ford had appeared about one mile up stream of the Mashi ford opposite the Ziarat of Padah Sultan near the ancient bridge of burnt brick revealed in the bed of the Khwabgah Canal. Loaded camels crossed easily on the 1 ith July when the volume was 2,415 cusecs. Ziarat-i-Padah Sultan was the site of the camp of the Russo-Afghan Commission on the 25th October 1884 and this Mission on 19th February 1903. The two conspicuous Euphrates poplars noticed at the Ziarat in 1884 were washed away in the great flood of the spring of 1885. Tbe Ziarat is now only marked by the mound on which the accumulations of sticks and stones of the usual Baliich Ziarat are placed. Guzar-i-Khoga or Khwabgah .—This is a sandy ford, seldom or never used for loaded animals. It appears much later than the fords higher up the river. On the 25th June when the discharge of the river was about 5,500 cusecs the river was only fordable for men and horsemen. The heading up of the water after the band is made affects the ford, so that it is only in use for a short period each year. There is an uncertain ford somewhere above the Band-i-Seistan for riders and footmen after the floods subside in Above theBand-i-Seutan. June or July and before the Band is made about the middle of September. I crossed twice in August 1903 when the river was about 3,500 cusecs and found it a difficult and treacherous ford. + The river discharge rose to 4,100 cusecs on the 1st March and on the 3rd rose suddenly to sonae 6 ,o 0 oor 8 000 cusecs; on the 9th it was gauged to be 10,000 cuiecs; the volume afterwards gradually fell again.478 [App. 21. When the tamarisk band across the river is in existence, it is used to cross the river below the bifurcation. When The Band-i.Seist 5 n. first made j t p resen t s a level bed of springy tamarisk right across the river, very difficult to walk on, except at the path made of grass and earth that the builders used when carrying forward the bundles of tamarisk during construction. Soon after the bcind is made the tamarisk sub« sides at places to fill holes scoured under the structure. The surface is then yery uneven and at places under water. Even so flocks and herds are sometimes brought across. The road could be made much better if a surface of^grass and eartlTwere laid. This roadway exists from the time of the completion of the band about the 15th September to the first flood at the end of December or beginning of January. The bridge built by the Mission across the Nad-i-Ali channel was of this nature. Such works are called by the Seist&amp;ni ; they often make crossings on small shelas in this way. Fords on the River Helmand below the Band-i-Seist&amp;n and on the Rud-i* Parian* Guzar-i~Lakri .—When the band is in existence the river is fordable at the broad shallows below, unloaded camels could ford here with difficulty at the end of February 1903, when the discharge below the band was 3,000 cusecs. But a good and long established ford exists at the end of the long sweep which the river makes to the north-east. The ford is opposite Deh Lakri and is about 4 miles below the band. It has a bottom of small gravel and is often used for loaded camels. The river here became fordable on the 4th August 1903 when the volume above the band was 4,000 cusecs, and became unfordable on the 20th February 1904 when the volume of the river above the band became 5,000 cusecs ; the ford re-appeared on the 30th June when the volume of the river became 4,300 cusecs. Guzar-i-Parian or Guzar-i-Milak .—But known to the Mission as the “ Shah Gul Ford” is situated just below the off-take of the Nad-i-Ali channel or Rud-i-Afghan. The ford is due to the sand bar which forms at the heads of channels at the bifurcation of the parent stream. This is due to the sudden drop in velocity as the stream enters the distributaries; the drop in velocity is due to the increase of sectional area as the water from the parent stream escapes down the distributaries. As a result the parent stream! as it approaches the bifurcation is narrow and deep, while the heads of the distributaries are shallow and wide. When searching for a ford at such t This formation is found at all the bifurcations not only at Shahgul but below Burj-i-As in the Nad-i-Ali channel; at Jalalabad where the Rud-i-Parian breaks up into shelas; at Girdi Chah where an old channel of the Melmand dispersed its waters; at the tail of the Sard- Shela where the Shelag distributes its waters to the Gaud-i-Zireh. The wells at Sar-i-Zireh on the road from Bandar-i-Kamal Khan to Kirtaka are in the deep parent channel above the bifurcation. The wells at Girdi Chah are also in the deep parent channel. For a long time after the river dries the water remains in this pool held back by the bars and is eventually conserved in the sand that filled the hole scoured in the clay. a bifurcation one is not likely to be found above the bifurcation, but the several branches are probably fordable at their heads. The Shahgul ford appears later and disappears earlier than other fords down the Rud-i-Parian, but it is a good ford with a hard sandy bottom and good ap proaches. When the scour had taken full effect a bed of gravel appeared in the river near the ford. The ford disappeared about the end of February 1903 when the discharge of the Rud-i-Parian was about 2,800 cusecs and the main river 4,000 cusecs ; it re-appeared on the 8th August 1903 when the discharge was 1,822 cusecs, the main river being 3,850 cusecs. It disappeared on the 11th March 1904 when the discharge rose suddenly from 2,845 t0 7 &gt; 5 00 cusecs. When the Mission arrived at the Shahgul ford in March 1903, it was no longer fordable. The baggage was ferried Ferrying the Mission baggage across. . -p rr „ • across on tutw. To effect this more speedily two large tutin were lashed together with ropes and formed into one raft which was pulled across the stream by ropes; two ropes were attached to the raft, *Rud-i-Parian or “ river of the faries though Major Brazier Creagh said in 1897 that the word is Rud- i-Pariun or “river of abrupt flow,”^and this was the word used by the Mission ; but Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh says Rud-i-Parian is the word used in correspondence among cultivated Persians.App. 21.] 479 one going to each shore. The baggage was rapidly ferried across on a number of these rafts. A large quantity of log line and light manilla rope which the Mission had brought with them made the working of these rafts possible. The tutin could have been lashed together into rafts with country-rope made from wool, but such ropes were not strong enough to haul these large rafts against the very strong current that existed at this site. The rafts carried from 20 to 30 Indian maunds. Guzavi-Jahanabad, six miles below the Parian ford, is situated by the side of the ruins of Muzafar-ud-Daulah’s city of Tilfak (local corruption for Tiflak) near Deh Khadung. One of the. small mounds or ruins being near the ford on the left bank, called Tappa-i-Tirah or the mound of the ford. On the right bank the road passes north of Deh Yusuf. This is now (1903 to 1905) the best ford on the Rud-i-Paridn; the bed is sandy and the stream flows in one broad channel with an even bottom, 350 feet wide. The camels of the Mission without their loads crossed at this ford at the end of March 1903 when the volume of the Rud-i-Paridn was about 4,500 cusecs and that of the main river 6,000 cusecs. The ford appeared again for loaded camels about the end of July 1903, when the volume in the Rud-i*Parian was about 2,400 cusecs and in the main river 4,200 cusecs. The exact date is not known, but judging from the volume of appearance and disappearance in 1904, it would be about 15th July when the discharge was 3,000 cusecs. The ford disappeared on the 10th of March 1904 when the main river rose suddenly from 6,617 cusecs on the 10th to 13,600 cusecs on the 12th ; and the Rud-i-Parian from 2,845 cusecs t0 8,707 cusecs. The ford appeared again on the 1 ith June 1904 for horsemen and pedestrians only when the volume in the main river was 7,209 cusecs and in the Rud-i-Parian 5 ) 000 cusecs ; and for loaded camels on the 24th June when the volume in the river above the band was 5,600 cusecs and in the Rud-i-Parian 4,000 cusecs. The service of the Mission preferred this ford on the Rud-i-Parian to all others ; it is the favourite ford between the city and the district of Miankangi, the bit of Persian territory between the Parian and the Nad-i-Ali channel. Guzar-i-Maliki, five miles below the Jahanabad ford, is on the important and well-defined road from the City through Bunjar, Kasimabad, Siadak and Deh Dost Muhammad to Chakhansur and Khash. It crosses the Parian at the con spicuous tower called “ Dikki,” a bit of a ruined sundried brick building standing on a mound in the middle of a tamarisk covered island. The river is not in one stream ; there are several shelas, a broad and deep one with steep sides, that should be ramped, is crossed on leaving the river-bed on the east bank at Deh Maliki, where there is a stubby modern tower of sundried brick which marks the ford. The crossing at the main shela is also bad at times; in the year 1903-04, there was one place, 30 feet wide, which was 5 feet deep and which spoilt the ford. The ford is seldom useful for loaded camels except at low river. The ford appeared about the 20th August 1903, or about 3 weeks after that at Jahanabad, when the supply in the Rud-i-Parian had fallen to 1,679 cusecs and the main river to 3,357 cusecs. 1 he ford disappeared in the sudden rise of the river on the 1 ith March 1904 and re-appeared on the 20th June for horsemen and footmen about 10 days after that at Jahanabad wTien the volume of the Rud-i-Parian had fallen to 3,990 cusecs and the main river to 5,700 cusecs ; and for loaded camels on the 2nd July, 8 days after the Jahanabad ford, the discharge of the Parian being 2,185 cusecs. The greatest depth measured on the 12th July 1904 was 3*8 feet. Guzar-i-Margo, between Jalalabad and Margo, six miles below the Maliki ford. There are seven shelas to be crossed at this ford when the river first be comes fordable ; the bottom is uneven and uncertain ; it is not a good ford for loaded camels. At the end of December 1903 the Mission camels crossed with some difficulty when the discharge at the ford was only about 1,000 cusecs. This ford appears about the same time as the Maliki ford. The greatest depth on the 12th July 1904 was 4*3 feet, loaded camels could only cross such a depth if the bottom was good, current small, weather warm, and loads very high upon the saddles. iC639FDj BB480 [App. 21. Guzar-i-Deh Kundui or Gurg ’Ali, two and three quarter miles below the ford at Margo. This is not a good ford for loaded camels; besides the main river there are three other shelas to cross; the bed is very uneven and loaded camels can only cross at low river. The sides are steep and need to be ramped, as the soil is very slippery. The ford appears about the same time as that at Maliki, but is not so good. A surveyor’s loaded camel crossed here on the 23rd February when the discharge of the Parian was 2,100 cusecs. The greatest depth at the ford on 12th July 1904 was 3’o feet. Guzar-i-Musjid*-i-Gurg } Ali. —About six miles below Jalalabad all the streams •The ruin-d mud walls of the musjid are on the left of the Rud*i*Pan’an Collect tO DaSS through bank at the ford. •. r . , r . a ridge ot sand-hills and do so in a broad shallow stream of low velocity; the ford on the 19th and 20th March 1904 was just feasible for loaded camels when the discharge of the river was 8,861 cusecs and of the Parian 5,700 cusecs ; the ford was then 800 feet wide and 4*0 deep at the deepest places. Loaded camels were only able to cross, because the velocity was very low and the weather warm. The ford is about 100 yards wide in the direction of the stream and has an excellent firm sandy bottom. The ap proaches to the ford are excellent. The disadvantage of the ford is that when the Parian rises above 3,500 cusecs, or so, the waters escape to the west by shelas above and below Jalalabad, flooding the low-lying country which lies between the Rud-i-Paridn and the high ridge made by the ancient canal which served the ancient ruins from Tappa i-Rindan to Tappa-i-Adira. The Mission camels after crossing the main stream of the Parian at Musjid-i-Gurg ’Ali marched up the left bank of the stream and got across the main spill on the sand bar at its head where it left the main stream two miles below Jalalabad. There w'as no possible road over the flooded country to the west of Musjid-i-Gurg ’Ali ; the land as soon as flooded becomes too soft for traffic. The road then went from Jalalabad t in M^eii 1905 the water m the sheia that passes to Tappa-i-Rindan crossing some broad shallowf flooded lands where the going was not good—chiefly on account of water channels which intersected the flooded area and made deep places into which the unwary fell. . depth at the ford of Musjid-i-Gurg ’Ali is not likely to be affected by the height of the water in the Hamun, as this cannot be considered to begin till two miles below Tappa-i-Kakha, or 10 miles below this ford. During the stay of the Mission in Seistan this ford and that at Jahanabad were the first to appear on the Parian ; the former was the ford most used by those who were going to Lash Juwain via Takht-i-Shah and Tappad-Kharan and Pesharwaran. it became fordable again on the 16th June, or 8 days before the Jahanabad ford, when the volume of the Helmand was 6,816 cusecs and the Parian 4,852 cusecs. On the 12th July 1904 the greatest depth was 2-75 feet when the discharge of the Parian was about 1,700 cusecs. Guzar-i-Shaikh Watsi. —Five miles below Musjid-i-Gurg ’Ali; it is only a ford when all the shelas to the west of the main stream have dried up and the water has retired from the askfo'n lands around Tappa-i-Kuhlak and Tappa- i-Akbarabad. Jbe Parian then flows in a single stream under its east bank beneath Deh Shaikh Waisi; at times loaded camels take this road to the City rom the ullages to the east of Shaikh Waisi. Horsemen and footmen can get across the flooded lands to Tappa-i-Adira at low Hdmun. The ford appears about the same time as that at Jahanabad, but being in an out-of-the-way and sparsely inhabited part is not much used. It could not have been used on the 20th March 1904, as there was then no way for loaded camels across the flooded lands. 1 . r 9 04 u re ; a PPe a red for loaded camels on the 20th June, or four days later than the ford at Musjid-i-Gurg ’Ali and 4 days before the ford at Jahanabad. In January 1905 the Mission was in camp at Deh Shaikh Waisi, while the Shaikh Waiji ford in 1905. volume of the Rud-i-Paridn wasabcut 600 cusecs. The ford at the village of Shaikh , ^ — — --- viicii- pnoov.* under Tappa-i-Rindan and flows into the Chung-i- Surkhaki was reported to be 57 feet deep at the deepest part where the road crossed, Unless this deep part could be avoided or bridged, the ford of Musjid-i-Gurg ’Ali would be useless. It reems that the shelas to the west are developing; probably the present main stream is silting its bed, and if so, diverting more of its water into the shelas to the west. i * *r ^* 4 4 i * App- 21.] 4 8 i Waisi has a very soft bottom, but there is a ford with a hard bottom a mile or so further down the stream between the village of Deh Mardan on the right bank and the Ziarat of Hasrat Abbas on the left bank. 1 his ford was often used by those going to the City; at that time there was not much water coming from the west of Jalalabad by the Shela-i-Narcharan. Fords on the Nad-i-Ah channel of the Helmand, now beginning to be called the Rudd-Afghan. Up to 1895 ^is channel carried the main stream of the Helmand towards Burj-i-As, where it bifurcated to the Shelas, Shamshiri, Lakhshak, Sikhsar, Charkh, etc.; it was a very broad stream with marginal embankments and tamarisk thickets. When the Riid-i-Paridn finally formed (as we knew it) in the spring of 1896 only a reduced volume found its way down the Nad-i*Ali channel, so that the superfluous area in the channel was silted up and now forms wide berms inside the marginal embankments. The stream is now narrow and as a rule deep with very few broad and shallow places, so that it is not easy to ford and becomes unfordable very early in the flood season. At the village of Milak near the sundried brick pillar of that name, and a little below the junction of the Afghan leading cut, the river spreads out into shallows and is fordable when the discharge of the Nad-i-’Ali channel is not more than 800 cusecs. There are some beds of small gravel near this site; there are no gravel beds further north than this on the river that 1 know of. At Deh Mandoz'ii a collection of huts in Afghan-Seistan; at the junction of the Afghan channel and the Nad-i-’Ali channel is a ford. Gnzar-i-Khoja or Reg-i-Sohbat, known to the Mission as “ Bela’s ” ford. This ford is at the bend of the river miles below Milak village where the path from the Parian ford near Shahgul to Nad-i-’Aii crosses the river. The ford is marked by some high sand-hills on the left bank, called Reg-i-Sohbat. It is J mile above the village of Deh Khoja which is at the conspicuous Padag tree on the right bank of the river. This ford was used while the Mission camp was at Nad-i-’Ali in February 1903. It became unfordable to loaded camels when the discharge of the Nad-i-’Ali channel rose to 800 cusecs, though it was fordable for horsemen up to a discharge of about 1,000 cusecs. This ford is an instance of the neglect of cross country communication by the inhabitants. There are no ramps, and when I crossed here in the first week of December 1904, a ramp had to be made to get a riding camel across; the depth was then 2*5 feet, the volume being 360 cusecs. Burj-i-As. —There are uncertain fords near the curves in the river above and below Burj-i-As, the tower on the right bank of the river to the north-west of the fort of Nad-i-’Ali. These fords disappear when the discharge becomes 800 cusecs. The Mission had to build a tamarisk bridge across the river above Burj-i-As, because there was no ford for loaded animals though the discharge was only from 800 to 1,000 cusecs. On 19th December 1003, the ford was a little above the head of the Sikhsar at the bifurcation, and loaded camels crossed in 3-0 of water (365 cusecs). The ford disappeared on the 1st March 1904 when the discharge was 800 cusecs. The reason that the ford is here above the bifurcation, and not below, is that the site was once used for tamarisk band to regulate the supply to the Shelas, and a ford is obtained over the remains of these band. The Nad-i-Ali channel bifurcates about a mile below Burj-i As. The Sikhsar is fordable at the bifurcation of the Shela-i-Go Kushta, about 2 miles below Burj-bAs. This ford disappears also for loaded camels when the Nad-i-’Ali channel discharge is 800 cusecs. But the shelas being narrow can be easily bridged with tamarisk which grows there in large quantities. Fords on the Rud-i-Seistdn. The fords on the Riid-i-Seistan are differentiated from those on the Parian and Nad-i-’Ali channels by the supply from September till the floods set in being kept up by the band. The Riid must also be considered in three parts, the upper broad and deep main channel as far as Kimak ; in this length some large canals, the Rud-i-Hasanki or Asiniki, the Madar-i-Ab and other smaller ones1 482 [App. 21. have taken off a considerable volume of water ; the next reach is from Kimak to Dashtak where the river spreads out into a wide shallow stream that is very favourable for fording; the third reach is below Dashtak where the tail clusters of the distributing channels are situated. In this reach the river has acquired the regular section of a canal ; floods are passed off by the many distributary channels with comparatively small rise of supply in each individual stream. Below Kimak, the fords in the Riid-i-Seistan disappear only during the height of the flood season. Above Kimak, they disappear earlier and re-appear later than those on the Rud-i-Parian. The following is a list of the fords :— Guzar-i'KInvdja Ahmed .—This ford is 4 miles below the head at Ktihak at the site of the village of Khwaja Ahmed ; that was destroyed in the flood of the 1st May 1903. The tower and the sundried brick domed buildings of the village still stand to mark the ford. It is said up to 30 years ago a large Padah tree stood here and the ford was then called Guzar-i-Padah-i-Dad Shah; the ford is said to be 100 years old. It was not fordable for loaded camels when the Mission came here on the 1st April 1903. It remained unfordable till about the 15th June when the volume of the Rud-i-Seistan was 1,400 cusecs. The ford did not disappear on the 13th September when the band was completed (dis charge 800 cusecs), but remained till the 10th January 1904 when the discharge rose from 1,400 to 1,800 cusecs. The ford re-appeared on the 5th June 1904 when the discharge fell to 1,200 cusecs. On the 28th March 1904, camels without loads found a ford over the sand bars at the bend of the river just below the village; the volume was 1,800 cusecs. Guzar-i-Shahristdn-i'Kuhna, immediately above the head of the Rud-i- Hasanki, near the old ruins and miles below the Band-i-Seistan. This ford is on the road from Kala-i-Nau to Sharifabad. The ford disappeared on the 10th January, but it did not re-appear till the 5th July when the discharge was 532 cusecs. Men could wade across on the 20th June when the volume was 735 cusecs. Guzar-i-Shahristan-i-Nau appears each year opposite the village where the bed of the river has hard soil. The road from Kala-i-Nau to Kaod crosses here. It is 9 miles below the band. The ford disappeared on the 10th January 1904 and re-appeared on the 8th June when the discharge was 1,028 cusecs. Guzar-i-Burj-i’Sarband, 11 miles below the head at Kiihak, is on the road from the Mission camp to the City. It disappeared on the 10th January and re appeared on the 5th June when the volume was 1,216 cusecs. It is said to be a very old ford ; in 1903. it was spoilt by a local scour ; this is said to have silted up and the ford has become a good one. It is an important ford just under the village around which the river turns ; the upper ford to the east of the village, leads to a difficult path through many sand-hills ; the lower ford to the west of the village to a certain extent avoids the sand-hills on the right bank. Guzar-i-Kimaky 15 miles from the head of the channel at Kuhak. The river spreads out into a very wide shallow channel which is maintained by a hard bed. The ford only disappears in the time of high flood. It disappeared on 31st March in 1904, when the volume was 2,581 cusecs, and re-appeared on the 15th May when the volume was 2,191 cusecs. General Pollock forded here on the 6th March 1872 on his way from Kandahar to the City, then called Nasirabad. Dr. Beilew says that the ford was very narrow and cattle who got off the direct line went into deep water. Guzar-i-Pulgi .—The channel here is also very wide and the bed sandy ; in the year 1904 the ford remained throughout the floods, but in 1903 it disappear ed for a few weeks at the height of the flood. The ford is 7 miles below burj-i- Sarband and 18 miles below the head at Kuhak. On the 1 st February 1905 when the Rud-i-Seistan was in flood and dis charging between 3,000 and 4.000 cusecs this was the only ford fit for loaded camels. The way over the ford twisted a great deal and had to be explored before being used. This exploration should be finished before the kafila arrives or the impatience of ignorant camel drivers will end in camels being driven out into deep water. s % wApp. 21.] 483 *v Guzar-i-Dashtak. —The ford is opposite the village ; the river spread out wide among sand-hills. It is 3^ miles below Pulgi and 4 miles above Muham- madabad. Guzar-i-Muhammadabad, four miles below Dashtak and 6 miles above Chil- ing. The river flows in an even regular channel, much reduced in volume owing to the canals given off, and to a large escape known as the Noro-i-Muham- madabad, noro being an escape. The ford appears and disappears about the same dates as the ford at Kimak. The road from Robat to the City through Muhammadabad is more direct than that through Chiling, and the ford is better for loaded camels, but there are no villages on the direct road to the City, so pedestrians and eques trians prefer the road Did Chiling which passes through the most populated part of Seistan. Guzar•{•Chiling. —The ford is at the cluster of canals at the tail of the river, above the head of the Daudi canal. The Rah-i-Ba ishahi from Robat to the City crosses here. General Goldsmith’s party crossed here in February 1872 on their way from Bandar Abbas to the City ; the canal was said to be 30 feet wide and 6 feet deep. The ford is in a canal, narrow and shallow. The road taken by the postal riders crosses here and passes through Chah Muhammad Raza, Warmal, Pusht-i-Dasht, Daulatabad, Jo-bakhsh, Akbarabad, Chiling, Jumalabad, Daudi, Afzalabad, Nasirabad Saiyad, to the city. The Amir Ali Akbar, Hashmat-ul-Mulk, makes the kadkhudas responsible that the canals in their villages where crossed by this road are bridged. The kadkhuda is responsible for loss or damage by defects in the bridges on the canals. Ferries. On the River Helmand rafts, called Sal, are made by placing a frame work Sal or gourd or skin rafts used along the main of Sticks, preferably of Willow, acrOSS river - gourds or inflated goat skins; such rafts are said to be made large enough to carry 3 camel loads of baggage and to be 8 feet by 6 feet and borne on 12 large inflated skins. The largest goat skins I have met with only hold 20 seers Indian of water. So that the skins must be underestimated or the load overestimated, probably the latter, as a little looks a lot on a rickety raft in a big river. Such rafts are often used by individuals in the delta. Tutin are not known up the river ; there is no tut and there are no Saiyad T people, and apparently tut has never been carried up the river for use at ferries. An arrangement is also in use to take goats and sheep across the river called Chosal a Chosal (from Chobsal } a pole raft). 1 his is a log of willow wood to which 6 to 10 goats or sheep are tethered, so that their heads come on the wood, an experienced man will take the sheep across a full river in this way, he himself being supported on gourds or skins. Tutin ferries in the delta. There are certain well known fords on the Rud-i-Seist&amp;n, Rud-i-Parian where , , , ... bulrush rafts or tutin are maintained. No Ferries how and where maintained. f . , * . m j • » a i* i i femes are kept on the Nad-i- All channel. Those on the Rud-i-Seistan are nearly all maintained by order of the kadkhuda for the convenience of the village. No tutin are apparently kept at the orders of the Governor. The cultivators pay the Saiyad an allowance* of grain from the threshing floor at harvest time, varying from two to four man Seistani of wheat and barley per plough. The only tutin ferry on the Rud-i-Parian maintained by the villagers is that at Guzar-i-Parian, called Shahgul ford by the Mission, which is maintained by the cultivators of Milak, where the saiy^ds live, and by the culti- * Such allowances are sometimes referred to as Rogea. The sieve used to clean the grain after winnowing has been done is called Rogez. The cultivators use this as a convenient measure to divice out their own grain among themselves. The saiyad turns up at this function and receives a certain number of Rogea or measures of grain; hence the colloquial use of the word as an allowance.

Travellers pay hire at the rate of about half a kran to a kran a head according to their rank. The payments are also made in kind. The tutin are maintained during flood time when the river is not fordable ; they are generally abandoned in the hot weather when the ford appears, but are again made when the weather becomes cold to carry pedes trians, who prefer to pay rather than walk through cold water. On the Rud-i-Seistan tutin ferries exist at Khwaja Ahmed, Shahristan-i- Ferries on the Rud-i-Seistan. Kuhna, Shahristan-i-Nau, Burj-i-Sarband, Kitnak, Muhammadabad and Chiling. At Kimak the tutin is worked above the ford at the narrow and deep channel. All these ferries are owned by three saiyads, named Shahgtd, Muhammad Kor and Husaina. They have to pay 30 kran a year rent to the kadkhudas of the village at which the ford is, except at Kimak. At Muhammadabad and Chiling, where the stream is narrow, the tutin is •Pa = foot. not worked by a pachao* or pole, but is _ Chub = pole ; &lt; hauled across by a rope of kirta grass (Chiluk). The tutin being tied to the middle and the ends of the rope being on either bank. No tutin seem ever to have been kept at Dashtak and Pulgi ; the Rud is easily fordable except in very high flood, and tutin do not seem to be required even in winter. A tutin is kept by a saiydd at Deh Karim Dad on the main river between Deh Karim Dad on the main river below the Kuhak and Shahgul to Serve the road from band ' Deh Karim Dad to Khwaja Ahmed. He is said to collect 2 to 4 kran a day either in coin or in kind. He is not subsi dised by any village. At this part the river forms the boundary between Afghan and Persian Seistan and crossing is discouraged. When the Afghan Commissioner was in camp at Khwabgah he maintained a ferry above the band. Otherwise Deh Karimdad is the first ferry on the river. On the Rud-i-Parian in addition to the one at the Parian ford above men- Ferries on the Rud-i-Parian. are at Jahanabad ford, Mahki, Margo, Kundil, Musjid-i-Gurg Ali and Deh Shaikh Waisi. The kadkhudas arrange with the saiyads to maintain ferries here, but they do not take any share of the saiydd’s earnings as the kadkhudas on the Rud-i- Seistan do. The charge is half a kran a man, and there is no subsidy as on the Rud-i-Seistan. When the river is low and the weather warm the tutin at the Jalalabad, Margo, crossing is the only one not withdrawn. Tut for the tutin is brought by the saiyad from Bahringak at the tail of the TuL Rud-i-Parian. But the material for the tutin at Deh Karimdad and Shahgul ford is got from Shoro village on the Jharuki Shela in Afghan-Seistan. The tutin is said by these saiydds to last a week, but the Mission tutin at Kuhak lasted about three weeks. If the tutin is systematically overloaded, it soon becomes water- logged and useless. The tutin at the ferries are always in a moribund state and only able to take a man and a few things across. The Mission have had on every occasion to make new tutin at any ferry they required to use for even a small party. Tutin poles are got from the tall tamarisk or padah growing in the Mian- Tutin poles. k 311 ^ 1 or along the main river near Kala-i- .... t Path. Padah is preferred, because it is lighter and stronger ; a pole costs one or two kran and will last tw r o or three years with care. They are 10 or 12 feet long. J 1 he construction of a/w/m has been described at page 269 of Chapter XLIII. Swimmers. Single men cross the river swimming with the assistance of inflated skins or gourds. A man can be supported on one skin or on tw’o gourds connected by a» 485 4 * * App 21.] strong piece of rope which the swimmer passes under his chest, thus confining the gourds to his body. A Sarhaddi, not knowing the use of this rope, tried to cross the Rud-i-Seistan opposite the mainf camp with the help of two gourds free to slip from his grasp. This happened as soon as he struggled with the current and he was drowned. No Seistam attempts to cross a stream without a float of some sort; bundles of dried grass are used if no gourd can be got. In spite of this many deaths from drowning occurred in the delta tract during May iqoi while the river and its distributaries were in flood. ^ The skin of the goat is used to hold water, churn milk and when inflated Skins. t0 support a body in water.

The number available in the country is limited, however, and the Mission on more than one occasion bought up all that were available, paying 8 annas to one rupee four annas a skin accord- ing to the size.

The camels were taken across the Helm and at the band when the volume was about 30,000 cusecs and at other places higher up when the volume was not much less without difficulty. The charge is a kran a camel. Swimming horses. P eo P le up the river like those in Seistan are expert at swimming horses across the river. Namgation. The people of the valley say that in 1884, when the Russo-Afghanf Boundary Delimitation Commission passed through Garmsel, marching from Khwaja Ali to Chaharburjak, Mr. Merk brought a large boat down the river with sup- plies; the Mission forded the river at Chaharburjak and the boat was sent back. Fifty men were required to tow the boat upstream, the bazgav-i’gham of each village tow r ed the boat up to the next village. That is the only boat the people of Garmsel can remember to have ever seen. No boats in Garmsel. f This mission is known in the valley as Merk Sahib’s Mission. # . Mr. Merk says the boat had a flat bottom and had been brought from Girishk by men of the boatmen class, called Aubaz or Nilabi. The men asserted that it took a month to descend the river, but Mr. Merk thought this time must be exaggerated. The Aubaz at Girishk, he adds, speak Persian and are evidently at Girishk, as elsewhere in Afghanistan, a caste quite distinct from the rest of the people (Mr. Merk’s diaries). It is said that no one is allowed to use the river for rafting without permis- Rafts of padah wood. s *? n / r0m . ^ ^ 0vern °r. The per mission is obtained by the kadkhuda in whose village the padah trees grow. He takes one-fifth or one-fourth of the sum realized for the wood as his share. The wood is usually taken down the Riid-i-Seistan and sold for making ploughs, doors, rafters, etc. Most of the wood is now brought from near Mashi opposite Kala-i-Gawak and from Kala-i- Fath. It is said that very fine logs of padah were obtained from Khwaja Ali before the village was established. Wood not sold is left at Chiling. Such rafts were seen on the river in 1903 ; the man walked by the side of the river if the raft was small; on the raft were generally some goods. * Many of these accidents are due to the fact that when the stream dries up, as it did in 1902, the Seistani makes his well in the bed of the stream where the patn or ford to his village crosses ; men of the village itself have been drowned iu these holes when the stream flows again in sudden flood.APPENDIX 22.

He caught wild fowl in this Chung. At the annual floods of the Parian, some siit passes into Chung-i-Hasan-i- ’Ali. But for the greater part of the year, whatever silt travels with the water is caught by the thick reed and tut growing abund antly on the edges of the Chung and on the banks of Shela-i-Tutigah. Tazg grows well; but Khargoyah and Gak grow’ scantily. The silt brought down by the annual floods covers the seed; and these weeds being very delicate and feeble cannot sprout or grow up from under a thick layer of silt. Tut grows abund antly on the edges of this Chung. In 1904-1905, Ab- risham did not grow in this Chung\ and therefore the coot did not visit it. Chung-i- ' So-called after the Baringak. small sand hills formed at this place in ancient times when the country was dry. From the Parian side, a very small quantity of silt pass es into Chung-i- Baringak. But at heavy rainfalls, or at big floods a large amount of silt is carried into Chung- i-Barfi and into Baringak from the country near Tap- pa-i-Machatak and Shagalak. Rud-i- Banduki a spill channel of the Fa- rah Rud, also car ries silt into Barfi and thence into Bar ingak. grows in abund ance on the shores of this Chung. Be fore 1885, the saiyads from Kuh- i-Khwaja, Adimi, etc., all used to come to this Chung for tut\ but after 1885, the perennial stream of the Hel mand turned into Naizar-i-Adira and Chasmaka, and tut gradually grew up at other places also. Tang, Khargoyah and Gak also grow abundantly. But Abrisham the favor- rite of coot does not grow luxuriantly in this Chung.

The water in this Chung\s sweet j and remains drinkable as long as it lasts. This Chung be longs to the Khel-i-Gaz-i- Jamal which is on the road to Ziarat Khwaja Musa and Chashmaka. This Chung is the first to receive the waters at the tail of *he Parian near Deh Shaikh Waisi. It is fed by a Shela called Shela-i-Tuti- gah. When the water rises in the Hamun tutin work from Gazbar to Tappa-i-Kharan,the road for tutin pass es through Tutigah and Chung-UHa- san-i-Ali. The water re mains drinkable as the bed is covered with a good deal of silt from the river which keeps the water sweet. This C/z««g be longs to Khel- i-Saiydd at Dahan-i-Farah Rud. This is an important Chung, as it has three outlets run ning in three differ ent directions. Meshhedi Ali, son of Shah Nur, resident of Deh Gazbar, says that before 1885 this Chung was very deep. The flood of that year brought a large amount of silt fi'om the Rud-i-Farah and also from the Parian and Hel mand into the Chung, as it is situ- ated in a locality which receives water from all directions. After the flood of 1885, each successive year has brought more or less of silt into this Chung, its bed is therefore being gradually raised. There are three outlets from Chung-i-Baringak, which form three series of Chungs and Shelas. Series No. I—Chung-i-Baringak, Shela-i-Chung-i-Shor; Chung-i-Shor and Chung-i-Deh Surkh. Series No. a—Chung-i-Baringak, Shela-i-Gurguri; Chung-i-Gaki; Chung-i-Meshkushi and the Puzak H6mun.

I.-—The last to carry water from Chung-i-Baringak. Chung-i-Deh Surkh. In former times there was a vil lage near this place called Deh Surkh. This C/iwwghas since been called after that village. This Chung was very deep before the flood of 1885. That flood filled it with silt to a great depth as it was at the tail of Rud-i-Talai, an arm of the Helmand when the main stream flowed along the boundary. N ow-a-days very little silt from the tail of the Parian river passes into this Chung as its bed is far higher than the bed of Chung-i-Baringak. This Chung was at the tail of Rud-i- Talai, w-hen the main stream of the Helmand flowed through Shela-i- Shamshiri and Shela-i-Talai. It was then very deep; and its edges were covered under thick Naizar. In 1885 it received a large amount of silt, and was to a large extent filled thereby. Since then no weeds grow on its bed. Nowa days no silt passes into this Chung from the tail of the Parian river. Abrisham the grass that attracts the coot sprouts in Tirmah; and in autumn this Chung has either no water at all or very little water. No weeds for wild fowl grow on its bed. In spring Tazg and thin reed grow on the outskirts, but net very thick, as water does not stand in sufficient depth for a long enough lime to nourish them. Before the flood of 1885, weeds grew richly on the bed. But after the bed became covered with earth mixed with alkaline matters, the finer kinds of weeds ceased to grow here. All around this Chung there are huge mounds covered with ‘ Kallar ’ or * Shor.’ Every rain fall brings a good deal of the salt into the Chung making it impossible for the finer weeds to grow here. The silt of the Helmand they say is always sweet; and some day it may again be pos sible for weeds to grow on its bed. The bed consists of soil which is mixed with a large quantity of alkaline matters. When the water is flowing; or the depth is about 5 ft., the water is drinkable, but as soon as the depth is reduced to about 3-0 ft., the water be comes brackish and undrink able. The bed of Chung-i-S h 0 r contains much salt; and hence when the depth of water is re duced to about 2'o feet, the water becomes brackish and undrinkable. As no weeds grow on the bed birds do not visit this Chung in large numbers; hence no family of Saiydd claims this Cluing as its own. There are no weeds in this ChungXo attract birds, and no Saiyad claims it. This Chung receives water from Chung- i-Baringak through a broad shallow 4 Shela.’ The bed of this Shela is at a very high level, so it does not carry any water into Chung; i-Shor, until Shela-i-Mesh Kushi begins to flow into Chung-i*Puzak.

Meth sheep Kushi from Kushi an to kill. This too was much silted up along with other Chung. Now a-days it does not receive any silt worth the name from the tail of the Parian. It does not receive any silt now-a-days. This Chung has also been much silted up like Chung i-Deh Surkh. This is a very shal low Chung ; and water dries up very fast. No weeds grow on its bed. Tazg and some reeds however grow. No weeds grow on its bed. Tazg also only grows scantily, When the water is flowing, it is drinkable. But soon after it ceases to flow, it becomes brackish. When the depth of water is less than 3 0 feet, the water be comes brackish and undrink able. This Chung is not claimed by any of the Saiyad fami lies. No Saiydd claifns this Chung. Before the main stream of the Hel mand turned into the Parian, the,'water of Rud-i-Talai tailed into Chung-i-Deh Surkh. All around this Cbung the Nai zar was very thick. There were three Shelas running from Rud-i-Talai into Deh Surkh, named Gur- guri, Kurra, Lando. As-i-Haji Karim, an old wind mill now in ruins stands on the southern shore of this Chung. When the Hamun is full, tutin work from As-i-Haji Karim to Tapp a-i-B a r ez. These tutin are worked when Shela- i-Mesh Kushi is flowing full and the road across it to Pe- shawaran and Lash Juwain is not ford able. This Chung\s connect ed to Baringak by a short depression called Shela-i*Gur- guri. It is deep and much cut up at its head, but about half a mile lower down it becomes broad and shallow. This is a long Chung connecting Chung-i- Puzak and Chung-i- Baringak. Before the Helmand turned into the Parian channel, the water from Puzak first ran into Chung-i-Mesh Kushi and then into Baringak. Nowa days the water of Baringak first runs into Puzak; and when the latter is full, it overflows and water begins to run back into Baringak through Mesh Kushi and several other small shelas across Lurg-i-Sar-i- Luf and Lurg-i-Shalgami.2.

Hamdn-i-Pu- zak. &lt;1. ^ * 1 ^ Why it is so-called It is called after B rat, a Gaodar whose grand son, Najaf, still lives on Lurg-i-Buz Kushta at Dahan- i-Far ah Rud. Husain, son of Bar;.t, and father of Najaf was a notable man among the Saiyad and Gaodars in the reign of Ali Khan, Sarbandi. It is so-called after the high and pro minent vertical cliff cut by its waters out of the high aliuvial pla teau. This cliff is called Puza-i- Dak-i-Tir or the promono ry of the Dasht close b) the mound from which t. e amarisk for an arrow (tir) was got by Rus tam in his hgl t with Isfandyar. It is said he was wounded because Isfandyar was Rointan or the iron bodied. The arrows of Rustam had no effect on his body. At last Rustam’s fa- tner Zal suggest ed that Rustam should go to Puzak and fetch a tamarisk from a mound there which had two branches and one root. Out of that tamarisk Rustam made a two pointed ar row, which was finished with poi sonous drugs by Zal who was an expert in medi cines. Rustam ar med with this weapon fought w th Isfandyar, shot his two-bar bed arrow into the eye of Isfand yar and killed him. After that t:r of Rustam ; this Puza is called Puza-i-Dak-Tir and the 1 amun, the Hamun-i-Pu- za-i-l&gt;,.k-i-Tir. Does it receive any silt. Along with Mesh Kushi and Puzak this Chung also received silt, and was nearly filled up Before 1885 the Khash Rud u ed to bring some silt at flood limes in-to the Ha-run - i -Puzak ; and the Helmand too, at flood times, s&lt;nt a good deal of silt fr m its tail called Rud-i-Talai. Thus the Khash and the Helmand year by year raised the level of the bed of the Puzak H;i- mun. In the flood of 1885, however, a large quantity of water escaped from the Farah Rud, north of Juwain through a Sheia called Shela i-Ban- duki-Juwain. Near Juwain a break in the Dasht or pla teau exists, that is about 2 mi’es wide, and through this gap the waters of the Farah Rud came ru'hing into the Puzak Hdmun, des troy ing the Gaodai huts and drowning many of them ; the flood brought with it large amoun'.s of Shor, gravel and earth. Thus the Puzak Hamiin was to a large extent reduied in depth. Practically no silt now reaches the Puzak Hamun from the Helmand From the Khash Rud side only in years like 1903, when the rain fall is great some silt comes into the Puzak Hamiin with the rain water. What weeds grow on its bed. This is a shallow Chung. Tazg and other reeds grow on the edges, as water dries up very soon ; the w&lt; eds which are liked by the coot do not grow here. Before the flood of 1S85, the bed of the Puzak grew- all the grasses erf the Ha mun. The sport was good and in plenty Since 1885 the bed has risen and a large amount of Shor has been mixed with the sweet silt from the Helmand. Now-a- days the water gra-ses or weeds such as abrisham, gak, chortak, etc., grow scantily there. '1 azg and reed grow but tut is scanty. The Hamun-i-Puzak now-a days dries up soon. Last year, t.e., in 1904, the water in this Chung dried up in Novem ber 901, except in the lowest beds. Is the w'ater drinkable. The water is drinkable when it is flowing. But when ihe depth i- reduced to about 35 feet it becomes brackish and undrinkable. The water of the Hamuu-i-Puzak is drinkable when the denth is greater than 4 feet. Last year in 1904, the water be came undrink able about the 10th Angus' 1904. When the deptn in paits was 4 feet and the general dep.h o. the Hamun was about 3 feet. To what Khel-i- Saiyad does it belong. No Saivad fami- Iv lives here, as there is no sport. General remarks. The Hdmun-i- Puzak has only 2 taifa of Sai- yads now.

A 1 ! the older people in Seistdn say that Puzak is called Shi- kargah-i-Ru-tam. Tradition says that Rustam used to take the waters of all the canals that came to Seistan from Band-i- Yeko on the Hd- mand and filled Chung-i-Puzak once a year. There he enjoyed himself with sport. At that time it is believed that the Puzak Hamun was Gaud or very deep. When the Band-i- Yeko was destroyed, the river flowed down to Takht-i- Shah and into the Puzak. The people believe that the Pu zak was the Hdmun at a time when the Sabari w-as quite dry, and the latter bed was under cul» tivation. By de grees they say the tail of the Helmand river called Rud-i- Talai found another outlet towards Chung-i-Deh Surkh; so that the water of the Helmand ran into Deh Surkh, and thence into Barin- gak. When the Pu zak filled, it also overflowed into She- la-i-Mesh Kushi and then into Chung-i- Baringak. From Chung-i-Baringak to the west two branches or Series of Chungs were lormed gradually year by year, til! the Sabari was reached. All concur that the Puzak Hdmun was very deep at first, sn deep that when there was only a few feet of water in the S bari, the Puzak Hdmun had several Na za of water u Naiza = 7 or 8 teet). Gradually it silted up. Lven now the water from Chung-UBaringak goes- into Chung-i-Mesh Kushi and then into the Pusak Hamiin ; and only when the Puzak is filled up, does the water return back. In 1904, the w a f er of the Khash Rud did not reach the Hamun-i-Puzak. The flood was small, and it spread itself out in the Naizar. From the Chung-i-Barin^ak, some water reached the Puzak, but very litile. The bed of the Puzak Hamun must be much higher now as water does not stand for a long period on it.

In 1902, all except some very small pools dried up. The Puzak Hamun is not so exposed to the action of wind as the Sdbari Hamun, as it is protected by the high on the north that is on the side the wind blows, The water is not carried backwards and forwards bv the wind and therefore is not absorbed or dissipated so rapidly as the waters :n the other Him un are. This protection from the full force of the wind helps the Puzak Hamun to retain water a little longer than it otherwise would. Series No. 3 which is the first to receive water from Chung-i-Baringak. Chung-i-Bar- ingak. Chung*i*Bar- fi. This name is said to have been giv en to this Chung because one year when there was a heavy snowfall in Seistin a thick layer of ice remain ed on the surface of the water of this Chung for a long time; and the cattle who went to drink water were caught in the ice and perished there of cold. Since then it is called Barfi. It need hardly be ex plained that the Seistdni is very quick to make up lilt e stories to ex plain names. Sometimes he be lieves them him self ; at others he only wishes you to understand what chain of ideas the name suggests to him. This in itself is valuable inform ation. Only at the annual floods does some silt pass into Chung- i-Barfi from tne Chung-i-Baringak. But at a heavy rain fall, the washings from the high lands on the north which are covered with “shor” come into this Chung to a certain extent. Such a fall of rain occurs nearly every year in the winter. In former times, i.e., before the 1885 flood Chung-i-Barfi was very deep and all sorts of grasses grew on its bed. The flood of 1885 brought much earth mixed with a good deal of shor washed off the Fa- rah Rud Delta and now no weeds grow on its bed On the skirts, however. Bun- nun grass grows up richly as the water recedes ; and on its southern shore, reed and Taeg also flour ish, because the bed has not so much shor on that side. When the depth of water is less than 3 0 feet the water becomes brackish and undrinka b 1 e , But below the layer of newly arrived silt which contains thor, the bed of Barfi consists of sand and if the upper layer of shor is re moved and a well dug in the bed it gives sweet water. Aukan- i-Barfi and Gal- galak which are deep channels always remain sweet. In a year like 1902 this and Shela- i-Gharut Khar tfeie the only places in the northern inun dated area where wells gave really sweet water. The bed of Barfi is just like the bed of these aukan. It was a good sporting place, when it was deep and grew the grasses loved by birds. Now-a-days it has very 'little w'ater at the .time when the wild fowl begin to come to the Hamun. For these reasons no Saiy^d claims this Chung. Chung-i-Tir- atki. Chung-i- Narmika. Chung-i-Jan- g«- So-called because of the excellent growth of trat (a Salsolae',t plant near here in for mer times. The bed of this is much higher than that of Chung-i-Barfi. From Chung-i-Baringak water passes^ very roon into Chung-i-Barfi, but further than this the ground is high and the progress of the water is verv slow. From Chung-i-Tiratki, the water flows into Shela-i-Galga!ak ; then into Chung-i- Narmika, Chung-i-Jangi, Gamshad and then into Chung-i-Saruni. ° So-called because its bed is very soft and cattle cannot go into it.

The plain now is more Chu ru Bed of the Pueak H awuw.^When the water in the Hdmun-i-Puzak is not less than 4 feet to 5 feet men and cattle can safely cross the lake, lor though the bed is soft owing to the deep deposit of silt, yet the feet of the cattle are soon released from the mud, as the water helps the cattle by making them buoyant. But when there is about 1 to I’s feet of water, neither men nor cattle can cross, as once a man and more especially an ox is caught in the mud, he is held fast and can be saved only with difficulty. The Naizar is every where else hard and cattle graze without any danger. Before * the flood of 1885 the northern shore of Chung-i- Barfi up to Salian and the big Tappas Khakah, Shagali, etc., was covered under Gaz, Khar and shor (Salsolae)t plants. The alkali did not rise up and collect on the surface of the ground as they do now. The waters of that flood rising high destroyed the roots of the vege tation for the most part, and the place became denuded of vegetable growth. Soon after the whole plain became white. Hence it is that the rains twenty years berore did not an nually send into Chung-i Barfi so much washing of alkali soil as they do now. Chung-i- Barfi receives water from Baringak by a deep channel called Aukan-i-Barfi. It is about 30 feet wide and 6 to 9. feet deep at places. II.- Thi! Chu * Chun Ga; Bu!

The Saruni Taifa of the Gaodar have monopolis ed the Chung tothemselves; and allow none to graze their cattle here. It is there fore named after that Taifa. Chung-i-Saruni does not receive any silt from the Helmand side. But if the Farah Rud is in flood, and Rud-i* Bandaki brings wa ter some silt gels into Chung-i-Saruni. Chung-i-Saruni is a big Chung separat ed from the S&amp;bari Hdmun by Lurg-i- Buz Kushta and Lurg-i-Gaz i-Kopal. Weeds grow abun dantly as it is deep and retains water enough to grow the weeds at the right season. Tut and reed also grow luxuriantly On its shores. The water re mains sweet till it is reduced to a depth of about 1 0 foot. So long as the fish do not die, it re mains drink able. The depth of water at its deepest part on 17th December 1904 was 6 0 feet and it teemed with sport at that time. The Mis sion shot here during Decem ber 1904 and January 1905. Chung-i-Saruni belongs to Khel- i-Sar-i-Gaz-i- Jamal which lives near Kala- i-Nau on the southern shore of the Hamun. On the northern slope of Chung-i-Saruni Bunnun grass grows up richly as soon as the flood water re cedes. When Chung-i-Saru ni is filled, the water passes into the Ha- mun-i-Sdbari through Lurg-i-Buz Kushta. But the neck of these two aukan is rather high ; and it is only when Chung-i-Saru ni is quite full that water runs into Ha- mun-i-Sdbari. II.—Series of Chungs from the tail of the Parian river to the Sabari Hrfmun through Chung-i-Gardan Reg, Chung-Shahbeg, Zainal and Sabari. This is the course of the water running from the tail of the Rud-i-Parian through the Naizar into the Hamun-i-Sabari. In 1903-04 that is from March 1903 to December 1904 the water continued to flow into the Sabari Hamun through the series of Chungs and Shelas mentioned below Chung-i-Gar- dan Reg. So*called because on the northern shore of it there is a long neck of loose sand run ning along the Chung. This ChungAo^s not receive much silt now-a-dajs though at flood times the Rud-i-Parian car ries some silt into it. This Chung was very deep before the Parian river was formed. When this occurred a large amount of silt came into it. But this silt was sweet. Hence Chung-i-Ga r d a n Reg still grows all the grasses of the Hamun, and is therefore a notable place for sport. Reed and Tut grow in abundance along it. The water re mains drink able. In the first place it receives and passes on fresh water almost throughout the ear and again ecause the soil of its bed has no alkaline matter. The Chung be longs to Khel-i- Mulla Muham mad Saiyad, north of Kala- i-Nau. The Chung being noted for sport the Saiyads keep a keen watch there. At the tail of the Rud-i Parian, one small Shela runs to wards Tappa-i- Bahring, but the main arm joins the Shela called Dehno which flows from Chung-i-Surkh a k i near Tappa-i- Kuhlak into Chung- i-Gardan Reg. While other arms of the Parian dry up, this arm which runs into Gardan Reg still carries water, being the deepest of all. Before the Parian river was formed, the water to this Chung used to come from Deh Surkh, viA Baringakand Hasan AH and Tappa Bahring One arm near Tappa Bahring used to run to the south into Shela-i-Dehno and ran into Chuntr-i- Adira, Chung-i-Shor, Chungi-i-Rahsai. ° Chung-i- Gazg-i- Buk-i- Sahibdad. Gazg means a broad shallow channel ; Buk a net. Sahibdad was the name of some Saiyad, who used to come for sport to this place. The Shela does not receive any silt. All the silt brought by the Parian is caught by the Shela-i- Gardan Reg. Tut, reed, Tazg, Gak, Khargyah grow in abundar.ee in this Shela. The water is drinkable throughout the year. This is a rather deep channel connecting Chung-i-G a r d a n Reg and Chung-i- Shahbeg. It ran the whole season of 1903-04 and car ried water into the Hamun-i-Sabari.492 [App. 22.

In 1903-04, it received water from Chung-i-Gar- dan Reg, and pass ed it on into the Sabari H£mun, Khel-i-Pusht-i- Adimi owns this Chung. It receives fresh water from Chung-i-Shah- beg and passes it on in to the Sabari Hdmun. This is a small Chung at the head of the two aukan called Aukan i-Shib and Aukan-i-Bala. These aulan are not very long. They carry water from Chung-i-Hasan-i- Karbalai into the Hdmun-i-S d b a r i. Their necks are not so deep as the length in the middle. On the 28th January 1905, the down stream neck had only about 4‘5 of water, while the cen tre had more than 15 feet. This Chung is not broad,butit extends north by south at the mouths of the Aukan between l.urg-i-Buz Kushta and Lurg-i-Autak- i-Kalan. Chung-i-Mian Tali is the backwater or lagoon between the beach and the bar thrown up by the winds on the lee-shore of the Sdbari Hamun.

Series of Chungs from the tail of the Parian liver in Chung i Surkhaki near Tappa i-Kuhlak down to Hamun-i-Sabari through C hurg- Shor, Chung-i-Kahsai, Shela i-Ziarat and Hamun-i-Gharkando. Chun g -i- Surkhaki. It is so called after the name of the old ruin which the people call Diwal-i-Surkhaki. It receives a,good deal of silt at flood time but it is deep. On 15th January 1905, it had 5-0 of water in it. This is noted for sport. All weeds grow abundantly. All around it on the higher ground which is sub ject to the annual inundations of the Parian, ashk grows rich. The Chung is surrounded by high reeds. The water is very good and remains so, as it receives fresh water for the n ost part of the )ear. This belongs to the Khel-i- Saiy&amp;d opposite Deh Kala-i- N au and west of Tappa-i- Adira. I t Two big shelas and one small shela at the tail of the Pari- an river which are said to leave the latter near Jalalabad were running into Chung-i-Surkhaki about the middle of January 1905. They said that the-e big Shelas ran through out the year and fed Chung-i-Surkh- aki; this is the first Chung which receives water direct from the Parian. These Shelas are l.kely to develop and become the main stream. z * C h u'n g m- Adira. So called after Tappa-i * Adira. The Tappa is said to have been the site of a graveyard in ancient times. This Chung is said to have been very deep when the Helmand ran to Takht-i-Shah. Now Ch u ng- i- A di r a receives much silt at flood times. It is not deep. On 15th January 1905, the greatest depth was measured 3 0 feet ; after the strong hot wind of the summer of 1004 only about ro foot of water h id remained in it and there were no weeds growing. Khargoyah grows well here. Abrisham and other fine weeds do not grow. in small quantities grows. The reeds are very- thin on the south east side but thick towards the north. The wa’er ij drinkable when the depth is not less than 3'o feet. In the mid dle of January 1905, it was drinkable as fresh water had been conrrng in to the Chung since one month. The people have a tradition that when Tappa-i Adira was populated the lard where Chung-i- Adira now stands was all under cultiva tion. When the Shela -i-D e h n o brought water from the Helmand, this Chung was formed and was then very deep. In 1885, and after the Parian was formed, it received much silt and has now become shallow. This Chung be longs to the Khel-i-Saiyad west of Tappa- i-Adjra. S h e I a - i - Dehno. A new village was built when this Shela first brought water from the Helmand. Since then this Shela is called Shela-ii-Dehno, in literate Persian Dihnau. This Shela takes out from Chun g-i- Surkhaki. It is narrow and deep. Its first reach Is called Shela-i- Narcharan. In Jan- u a r y four Shelas were running be tween the Akbar- abad and Kuhlak Tappas. Over this area tut and reed do not grow thick. They are found only in patches. The Gaodars generally burn this Naizar every year. Shela- i-Dehno is well known in Seistan. On the bed of Shela- i-Dehno no weeds grow, as the water flows for the most part cf the year. On its banks tuzg and some other reeds and tutgxo-w. The Naizar about this place is scanty and small. * • P The water is dr i n k a bl e throughout the whole year. It is not a Chung and , wild fowl do not come on to this Shela. When the Helrrand went to Takht-i- Shah She!a-i. Dehno connected Chung-i- Deh Surkh and Chung-i-Shor with this Clnmg-i-S h o r and Chung-i- Rahsai. The area which | then formed Shela-i-D e h n o is still called Shela-i- Dehno. The same Shela now brings water from the tail of the Parian into Chung-i-Shor and Rahsai. The tail portion of Shela-i- Narcharan, taking out from Chung-i- Surkhaki is al§o called S h e 1 a -i- Dehno, as it jo ; ns Chung-i-Shor in the same area which vyas under Shela-i-Dehpo yvhen the Helrpapd went to 'fakKtf-i- Shah.

So called because the water gets brackish very soon. This Chung was very deep before. When the Parian was formed, a good deal of silt passed into it and raised its bed. Khargoyah grows on the bed ot Chung- i-Shor ; but it has not those fine weeds which attract Chur (coot) and other water birds. Though it receives water for most of the year its depth is not great. Water becomes undrink able soon. So long as the water runs in from the river it is drinkable, but when the depth is not more than 2’5 feet it becomes un drinkable. The cattle however drink it. This belongs to Khel-i-Saiyad opposite Kala- i-Nau village. Shela-i Dehno con nects the tail of the Parian and Chung- i-Shor. Hence this Chung receives fresh water for the most part of the year. In 1904-05, some water passed into this Chung even when the river was at its lowest. But from Chung-i- Shor no water pass ed into Chung-i- Rahsai. Chung-i- R a h s a i. Depth 4’2 feet on 18th J »r - uary 1905. So called after the name of the tribe of Gaodars who stayed at this place for a long time. This Chung also receives a little silt at flood times. It is said to have been very deep before 18S5. On the 18th January 1905, the depth of water was 4 - 2 feet. Weeds grow abun dantly ; and sport abounds. Fine weeds like abrisham, suzak alaf also grow in this Chung. There is thick tut and reeds all around it. The water remains dr i n k a b 1 e throughout the year, unless the Chung almost dries up when it becomes un drinkable. This Chung be longs to Khel-i- Saiydd at Gaz- i-Jamal. It was formerly very deep, but it is not so deep now. The silt brought down by the Parian in the year it was formed filled it up. The outlet from this Chung is rather high, and unless it is quite full no water passes towards the S^bari Hamun. S h e 1 a - i - Chashmaka. Depth 4’0 feet on 18th Janu ary 1905. So called after the name of the Lurg called Chashma ka. It has thick Naizar on both banks, and at its head. Hence little silt passes down the Shela. No weeds grow on the bed. The water re mains drinkable throughout the year. In 1904-05 Shela-i- Chashmaka ran till the end of August. Then it stopped flowing. About the 20th December 1904, it again began to flow, that is, fresh water reached it. Shela-i- Zi a r a t. Depth 2'o feet on 15th Janu ary 1905. So called after the name of Ziarat-i- Khwaja Musa, which is situated on its bank. This Shela is high and does not receive any silt. No weeds grow on its bed. The water is drinkable when the Shela is in flow. It becomes foul and undrink able soon after the flow stops, as the depth is small. Shela-i-Chashmaka and Shela-i-Ziarat both feed Chung-i- Khugi. Chung-i- Khugi. So called after Khug, a hog. It does not receive any silt. Khargoyah grows on its bed. '1 he depth is not great, there fore fine weeds like abrisharn do not grow. The water is drinkable when it is flowing, but as the depth is not great it becomes brack ish very soon. It belongs to Khel-i-Gaz - i - Jamal. When this Chung overflows, the water goes to the south as well as to the w'est. The Naizar about this place is very thick and is not much frequented. Ch ung-i- T a 1 a k i. (De p t h 3'o feet.)

The water remains drink able, but if the depth is less than ro foot, it becomes foul and is undrink able. These belong to the K h e 1 - i - Saiydd at Sar Gaz-i-Jamal, When these are filled up, the water travels to the south as well as to the west.

The water always remains clear, because the wind does not disturb its waters. Hence it is called Siaho, This Chung is situat ed in a place which is surrounded by very thick Naizar and practically no silt gets into it When the waters of the Sabari Hamun rise being driven by the wind some silt is brought into the Hamun-i- Garkando. But the silt does not reach Chung-i-Siaho. This Chung is very- deep, so deep that some Gaodars con sider it even deeper than the Sabari. In 1902 when ail the Chung dried up Hamun - i - G a r - danko, Chung-i- Siaho and Chung-i- Hasan Madaki had some water, and all the cattle from the Khels on Lurg-i- Tesha Kani came to drink water at these Chung.

The Sabari Hfimun scours its eastern shore and throws the mate rial on to the east ern slope of the small Lurg called Lurg-i-Teshi Kani and Autak-i-Kalan. About 30 years ago the western edge of this Lurg was about a mile to the west of where it is new. The action of the wind on the water of the Sabari Hamun caused it to gradually cut away the Lurgs and the stuff thus scoured was deposited in the Chung of Ha- mun-i-Gharkando. These Lurgs are therefore the lee ward beach of this Hamun. This Hamun is much prized by the Sai yads as it abounds in sport. The daghal or the clear part of the Chung is great and it is surrounded by thick Naizar. These two conditions are very favourable to the Saiyads. All sorts of weeds grow in this Hamun. The reeds are very tall and thick. The water re mains drink able to the last drop unless it becomes dirty. In 1902 when other Chungs dried up, this and Chung- i-Siaho and Husain Ma daki had water. Gaodars flocked on to this Chung from other parts and stuck to this place so long as the water last ed. Hamun-i-Ghaf kando belongs to the Khel-i- Saisad at Adi mi. General Remarks. The water of Chung- i-Siaho then runs into Ha m u n - i - Garkando. Between Chung-i-Siaho and Hamiin-i-H u s a i n Madaki on the east, and the series of Chung in the Hamun-i-Garkando on the west runs a Lurg called Kang- i-Saiy^d. There was about 30 of water on this Kang on 28th January 1905. It is called Kang-i- Saiyad b e c a u se w'hen the Saiyads go about these Chung they generally settle themselves in their tutin on the Kang, i.e. t island which is covered with thick reeds. Here the Saiyads are protected from the winds and they find good hiding places from which to snaie the birds. This is a very large and deep Chung. Meshedi Ali, son of Ismail Gaodar of Adimi visits it fre quently. He sa\s that in 1902 the water in this Chung remained drinkable to the last drop; and per haps it would not of itself have completely dried up had it not been drunk up by the cattle. This Chung is considered a reservoir, and the Sabads prize it very much. It is so called because it was very deep — even deeper than Sabari ( from Carle drown). This Ha- mtin receives water from the Chungs Siaho and Husain Madaki. So long as there is no wind and the water is rising, the water from this Chung flow's into the S£- bari. Of course co vering the Lurg-i- Tesha Kani and Autak-i-Kalan. But the wind drives a good deal of water into Gharkando and with it a large amount of silt scour ed from the west bank of the Lurg. It is said that Sardar Kurdil Khan, Sarbandi, dug a small cut across the Lurg to connect the Hamun-i-Sabari with the Hamun-i- Gharkando, so that his tutin might come and go from one to the other. This cut called Shela-i-Tisha kani is now’ almost level w ith the ground. They say that for a while it was deepened and widened by the action of the water from the Sabari Hamun, but afterwards it gradually filled up.

It does not grow any fine weeds, because the depth of the water is not much. Nor does it abound in wild fowl. But it is a place for the G^odars who live on Paran-i-Chheda, a Lurga close by the Chung. The water be comes undrink able when it is about 1*5 feet, but as soon as fresh water comes in it be comes drink able. This belong? to the Khel-i-Sai- yad at Adimi. Chun g-i-Garundgi receives its supply from Hamun-i-Hus- ain Madaki. It is surrounded on the north by thick Nai zar. On the south west the Naizar is not so thick. So called after Khug, a hog. It practically does not receive any silt as it is surrounded on all sides by thick Naizar. Tuzg grows in abun dance. But fine weeds do not grow and wild fowl are few. The water re mains drink able so long as the depth is not reduced to 2 0 feet. This belongs to the Khel-i-Sai- yad at Adimi. This is a big Chung and the last one oji the north of Rah-i- Teshakani. When the water in the Nai zar rises, it just fills up Chung-i-Khugi and then takes a southern course by Rah-i-Nai Rez. Rah-i-Nat Rez. This road runs from Adimi to Lurg.j-Tishakani, when the Hamun is low after the 120 days wind. From Lur&lt;»-i- Tishakani, it goes to Lurg-i-Buz Kushta and then to Dahan-i-Farah Rud. Rah-i Nai Rez is very noted, because the Lurg on which it runs, separates the Naizar consisting of Hamun-i-Garkando and Husain .Ylardaki from Chung-i-Darazl 'Y\\\s Nat Rez was only about 7.000 feet or about i | miles long with 15 feet of water on 24th January 1905. &amp; The rest of the road was qu-te dry. When the water in the Naizar rises, it just passes through the Nai Rez, which is also called ‘ Cxazg-i-Adimi or bhela-i-Adimi, and then r »ns into Hamunak. This Gazg or Shela-i&lt; Adimi is important because it is the connecting link between Naizar-i-Tosi and Naizar-i-Adimi. Hamunik Depth 27 feet on 24th Jan uary 1905. Chung-i-Ro- gani.

It was drinkable on 24th Janu ary 1905 but smelt very bad. The water re mains drinkable as it does in Chung-i-Siaho or Husain Madaki. It belongs to Khel-i-Sa^yad at Adimi. This belongs to Khel-i-Saiyad at Adimi. It does not receive much silt. But in strong winds Shela- i-Charaka Bal£ and Shib bring a large quantity of water from the Sabari into this Chung, and with the water a small quantity of silt also comes. All the weeds grow in abundance. But abresham and Soo- eak alaf are not so abundant. It is a good place for wild fowi. The water is drinkable, but on 30th March 1904 it was no ticed that in the middle of the width of the Chung where water was about 3‘o feet deep it was so foul that it could not be drunk. North of Rah-i- Chung-i-Daraz, t.e., the hung for tutin the Chung belongs to Khel-i-Saiytfd at Adimi; but south of that line it be longs to those who live at Af- zalabad. From H^munak, the water first passes into Chung-i-Da- raz ; and when the water rises still higher, it then runs into Chung-i-Ro- gani. To the north of this Chung there is a Shela called Shela-i- Mian Kang, which connects the Sabari Hamun with Chung-i-Rogani. When the wind blows strong, a large quantity of water from the Sa bari comes into Chung-i-Rogani. I.e\elsin this part were taken in. Janu ary 1905. At Rah-i-Chung-i* Daraz, the road is the shortest, because men alight on Dak- i-Gaz Al-i-Gurg, and thence they go to Mil-i-Nadir. But when Dak-i-Gaz Al-i-Gurg and Lurg- i-Tiratki are under water, this road is abandoned. Across this Chung there is another road called Rah-i-Kundil Khani which has not been used for a long time now.App. 22.] 497 The Naizdr, its pools and channels — Rud-i-Gharut Khar. [C639FD] GG Name. Rud-i-Gha- rut Khar. •V. » Shela-i-Cha raka (Bala and Shib) Chung-i- Khugia. ^ A Chung-i- Swajgi. Why it is so called. So called because it is said in an cient times there was a Charkh or Persian-wheel on a well at this place. So called after Khug, a hog. Does it receive any silt. So called because the Gaodars on the banks of this Shela were very prosperous; and they had plenty of Gharut (Karut or Kurud), curds specially prepar ed so as to keep. Gharut Khwar is also the name of a taifa, vide Chapter I. ThisRud receives a very large amount ol silt from the Sa- bari Hamun. On 26th January 1905 when soundings of the Rud were taken in a boat, it was found that about r5 feet of silt which was quite soft was deposited on the banks only recently. Ali, son of Ismail Gaodar of Adfmi, who has been in this locality during the last 20 years, says that in 1902 the Shela was very deep and there were deep wells in its bed. In 1903 the depths at its head were more than 6‘o feet; while on 26th January 1905 they were only about 3*5 feet. This is because the waters from the Sfibari Hamun were then filling the Shela with silt. These Shelas receive much silt from the Sabari, but at the head of these Shelas the Naizar is thick ; much silt is brought there and little or no silt reaches Chung-i Daraz except in very strong winds. It is a small Chung sutrounded by thick Naizar on all sides. It therefore does not receive any silt ex cept in high wind when the Hamun is full. It receives silt only at the high wind when the Hamun is full and the wind sends the waters of the Saba ri into this Chung also. What weeds grow on its bed. On the banks of these shelas Tang, Tut and reed grow thick, but in the bed there are no fine weeds. No fine weeds grow on its bed. Tuzg is the chief plant which grows here. No weeds grow here to attract birds ; but there are Tuzg and thin reeds with very high roots. Tutin cannot work in this Chung unless the water is 5 or 6 feet. Is the water drinkable. No weeds grow on the bed ; but on the banks only Tazg, Tut and reed grow. No fine weeds grow here. The water is drinkable. The wells in the bed of this Rud in 1902 when all the water in the Naizar had dried up gave sweet water and most of the Gaodars brought their cattle to Rud-i* Gharut Khar. The water is drinkable even when the depth is small. Water fis not drinkable when the depth is less than yo feet. When fresh water comes in the water becomes good. On 31st January 1905, when the camp of the Surveyors was on this Chung the water was brackish and had a bad smell. The survey people drank it because there was no water close by. The Gaod^rs drink the water at all times. To what Khel*i- Saiyad does it belong. This Rud belongs to Khel-i- Saiyad at Adimi. This belongs to Khel-i-Saiyad at Afzaiabad. This belongs to Khel-i-Saiyad at Afzaiabad. General Remarks. When the wind blows strong over the Sa bari Hamun it sends a large volume of water down the Rud-i-Gharut Khar. Part of this water escapes back again into the Sabari Ha mun from the tail of the Rud-i-Ghar ut Khar through the Rud-i-Mamun and a large quantity of water runs into S h e 1 a-i-C haraka and then into Chung-i- Daraz. The velocity of the water running into Rud-i*Gharut Khar during strong wind is said to be equal to that of the Rud-i- Helmand. Hence the alternate scour ing and silting. When the wind dies away the water re turns again into the Sabari H6mun by the same route that it flowed out. In Nuh‘i-Nahum {vide page 503) the wind forced such a large quantiiy of water into Chung-i- Daraz and Hamd- nak that the ground between the Naizar and the protection bank at Adimi was under water ; and some lives were lost in the Khel on this land. The high wind causes a great velocity in the Shela. -i-Charaka. This Chung is at the tail of Chung-i-Da- raz. It is surround ed on all sides by thick Naizar. South of this Chung the Naizar is high down to Rah-i-Gar- dowak along which the telegraph line runs.49? The Naizdr t its pools and channels—the Shur Rud. [App. 22. Name. Rah-i-Surkh Gazi.

To what Khel-i- Saiyad does it belong. So called, it is said, after the name of a ruined village of this name which existed at this place in an cient times. General Remarks. It is so called be cause soon after it ceases to flow iis water becomes brackish and un drinkable. From Shor (in literate Persian Shur) meaning alkaline. Rah-i-Surkh Gazi is t\\e Rung or road for tutin which work between Af^alabad and Mil-i-Nadir, when water in the Naizar rises high and Rah-i-Gardowak is not passable for man or animals. Along this Rah-i-Surkh Gazi runs the low Naizar from which start the three Shelas named Khwaja Ali, Gardo- wak and Shor Rud. The water into this low Naizar comes from Chung-i-Swajgi and Chung-i-Khugi when both of them overflow. This Shela is at the east end of Rfih-i-Gardowak. Informer days there was a Paran called Paran-i- Khwaja Ali, a litlle to the east of Shela-i-Khwaja Ali. The bed of the Shela is very high and it is the last of the three Shelas named above to begin to flow. It is very broad and shallow, and its bed is covered with Tuzg and thin reeds. When the Hamun dries up and these three Shelas cease to flow, the bed of the Shela-i-Khwaja Ali and Shela-i-Gardowak become slippery and the Saiyads then make Nai Rez, i.e.. they put reeds and rushes {Tuzg) on the slippery bed to allow loaded camels to pass safely. Fo'r this reason Rah-i-Gardowak is sometimes called Rah-i-Nai Rez. This Shela is the first to draw water from the low Naizar near Surkh Gazi. Its head reach down to the I elegraph line, being low, the water fills that up very soon ; but beyond the backbone of the Lurga the bed is high and water does not flow into Hamun-i-Sangal till some time after the Shor Rud begins to empty itself into that Chung. Shela-i-Gardowak is very wide and shallow. Its bed is covered with Tussg and thin reeds. The slippery parts on this Shela also are strewn with Tuzg and reeds when the road from Afzalabad to Mil-i-Nadir along the Lurga called Rah-i-Gardowak is opened alter the water level of the Hamun falls. Paran-i-Soofi is a small Paran on this Lurga between Shela-i-Khwaja Aili and Shela-i-Gardowak. The head of this Shela in Rah-i-Nai Rez is rather high, and water fills it later than it does the Shela-i- Gardowak. But once the water reaches its bed, it flows rapidly and the Shor Rud is the first to pour a good supply into the Hamun-i-Sangal. Thus the Shor Rud is the fir-t to carrv water across Rah i-Gardowak into the Naizar-i-Kuh-i-Khwaja. The Shor Rud is not wide, but is deep. The Mdldars dug wells in its bed in 1902. The water was not good for men to drink. The bed of the 1- hor Rud where it is deep is free from weeds ; but whenever 'it is broad and) shallow-, there Tueg and thin low reed grow. So calk’d, because Rud-i-Bnndan brings! The bed is clear of it is low lyin^ land which was cultivated for two years before it be came Naizar Am/ means cultivated land. Kurg xs a pit. lots of silt in this kurg. Abbas Rehan in the da\ s before the Persians took Seistan tried to emer Seistan ; the people did notallow him to cross the Hamun He built huts there and after the remains of those huts, this Chung is called Chung-i-Do-di- wal (two walls). This does not receive any sib from the river or from the Hamun. But when strong wind blows alkaline earths from the Dasht and high plains on the north are carried into this Chung. weeds. But on the slopes Tuzg and Khargoyah grow'. 1 his Kurg is high and water dries up socn. The water be comes undrink able when it is 2 5 feet deep. No weeds grow on its bed, as the soil contains too much salt, on the slopes, however, “ Karan” grows which is the name for the grass like Bunnun that grows under water. Taifa Ghor of Saiyadfe on Dak-i-Gaz-al- i-Gurg own this Chung. When the depth is less than 2'5 feet the water becomes un drinkable. The Khel-i-Sai- yrfd at Kuh-i- Khvvaja owns this Chung. The father of Karb^lai Abbas, an old man of about 60 yeats living in Deb Gaz- bar, used to say that he himself ate the wheat sown in bed of Kurg-i-Kal. This land was irrigated from the river Hel- mand when its main stream flow-ed to wards the Kuh-i» Khwaja. The first year the c^op came all right. The next year about spring the Sabari Hamun rose high and des troyed all the crops. No more crops were raised after that in Kurg-i-Kal. This is the first Chung to receive water from the Shor Rud across Rah-i- Paran-i-Soofi or Rah-i-Gardowak.The Naizar, its pools and channels—Hamun-i-Sangah Name. Why it is so called.

It was therefore named Sangal. It does not receive any siU. The bed is hard and has large boulders on it- Some very large stores as big as a table are also said to be found in the bed. On the south ern shore of Hamun- i-Sangal there are deep pits formed at the foot of the Lurga scoured out by the wind driven water The wind makes hitjfh waves on the Hamun just as it does on the Hamun- i-Sabai i. No weeds grow on its bed. The north ern shore grows some reed. On the east shore there is thick Naizar. Is the water drinkable. When the depth of water is less than 3 5 feet, it becomes un drinkable. To what Khel-i- Saiyid does it belong. General Remarks. This Chung be longs to the Sahadsat Kiih- i-Khwaja. This is very big and deep, next in size only to the Sabari Hamiin. It is sub ject to the action of the wind ; and the waves rise very high, as they do on the Sabari Hamun. The Sai\ads say that owing to the peculiar nature of the bed of this Hamun the fish grow big very quick. In two vears after the drought this Hamun became full of fish. They are very large and heavy, even larger and heavier than those in the Sabari Hamun Though the water is brackish the fish prosper well. I he Saiyads also say that the wild io\vl Avnb, Chash Jc, Lagan, Ghullab, HazzaJc y visit this Chung in large numbers about the time of reaping the Rabi crop. They lay eggs on the small Lurga in the middle of the Chung. Lurg-i-Da man. It is so called be cause Sardar Ali Khan, Sarbandi, laid a large num ber of nets on this Lurga. At that time this Lurga was not common ly known to the people in Seistan. This is a Lurga^ which is very well known in the Naizar as it is never completely deserted by the Gao- d&amp;rs and Saiyads. In 1903, too. though the flood was high, the Gaodars were able to stay here in the Paran. This is the second of the two Licrga in the whole of Naizar-i-Hdmand where people grow/a/i's, the first being Bash i-Dilbar on the eastern bank of the Sabari Hamun. To the south of the Lurrci they grow faliz. s * In the flood of 1SS5, this Lurga was completely covered under water and the Maldars and Gaodars had to leave the place. In all other years they have stayed there. Of course at flood time, some of them leave for higher places, and only so many stay there, as find dry room enough to make Paran and keep their catt’eand sheep on dry ground. Lurg-i-Hai dar.

The grandfather of Meshedi Ali. son of Shah Nur, killed Miadad in Naizar-i-Karchuk where he had. hidden himself. Khan Jan Khan being very strong, demanded the price of the blood of Miadad.

In 1885 water got into this Naizar ; and after that the water of the Noro or escape channels from the Rud-i-Seistin has been helping the growth of reeds around the Kuh-i-Khwaja and to the south of it. Even now there is no Naizar worth the name south of the Kuh-i-Khwaja. The Saivads do not own any Chung to the south of the Kuh-i- Khwaja and hence no names have been given to’these Chungs. The localities of this part of the Ha- mun are known by the names of villages that occur opposite to them or by the names of the prominent objects such as Darya i-Barabar-i-Sihkuha, or the Hamiin opposite Sihkuha and so on. After 1895 when the Parian channel became more important, the Naizar i-Kuh-i-Khwaja icceived water almost every year ; and therefore reed and tut are slowly growing up, as the main stream of the Helmand moves more to the west, as it is likely to do the growth of weeds (ala/), reeds (nai), bulrushes {iui\ and ru-hes (tuzg) will increase in this part of the inundated area and the pools (Chung) and reed beds (Naizar) around the Kuh-i-Khwaja will grow in importance.APPENDIX 23.

THE HAMUN-I-SAbARI. Notes collected by Lala Thakur Dass, Supervisor, on the spot. Traditions connected with Kala-i-Sabar Shah. Karbalai Abbas, son of Meshedi Muhammad, Taifa Karim, Gaodar, resident of Deb Gazbar, is a literate man, and is well versed in the traditions and stories that have descended from father to son in Seistan. He says that tradition tells that Zahidan, Pesbawaran, and the city of Sabar Shah were all ‘ abad 1 in the same period.^ The ruler of the city now at the bottom of the Sabari Hamun was Sabar Shah ; and the ruler of Peshawaran was Peshawar Shah. The latter was the father-in-law of Sabar Shah ; and both of them were remotely related to Malik Kutb-ud-din, Kayani, of Zahidan. Another tradition often heard in Seistan from people, old or young, is that from Zahidan to Peshawaran via Gazbar, Tappa-i-Kiihlak, Tappa Bahring, Tappa-bShagali, etc , etc., teemed with popula tion, so much so that the tops of the houses were in one continuous line ; a ‘ buzghala' i.e.^ a kid started from Zahidan city and went over the tops of the houses to Peshawaran without coming down to the ground. The ruins now remaining do not justify the literal acceptance of this story, but it graphically indicates their continuity and nearness to one another. The canals to irrigate lands about Peshawaran* and Kala-i-Sabar Shah t From yakdb came ^ rom Band-i-Yeko ;f and one of the _ . f . branches went to Kala-i-Sabar Shdh. In the course of time a son was born to Sabar Shah. When this boy and his mother 'went to see Peshawar Shah, who was the grand-father of the boy, Sabar Shah instructed him not to accept any money or lands from his grand-father ; but to ask him to increase the supply of water which was allowed to Sabar Shah. The Seistanis say that the boy asked his grand-father to make their outlet in the band or weir one brick instead of a half one (or &lt;( a khisht from a zhctu ,&gt; ). And accordingly this was done at Band-i-Dartang,} with the result that Band-i- Yeko could not be controlled any longer. The water therefore destroyed the city of Sabar Shah. This version of the tradition agrees with that of the Arbab Saif-ud-din. With the destruction of the Band-i-Yeko all the cities of Seistan $ Some say this name is Karun. were ruined and deserted; and the Hamun which extends from Tappa-i-Kharan§ down to Adimi formed. Year by year the Chung developed, and the Naizar grew up. It was then that the Sabari Hamun was formed. These traditions, as well as those given in the last Appendix, should perhaps have been omitted ; many of the people have a valuable store of traditions, but leisure and previous training are needed to do justice to them. They will be fully dealt with by Mr. Tate in his work. Peshawar } be it said, means an artizan. Meshedi ’Ali, son of Shahnur, a man of about 45 or 50 years of age, says that Kaia-i-Sabar Shdh as seen in 1902. when the Htimun-i-Sdban dried up, . . he went several times to the place where the ruins of Kala-i-Sabar Shah stand. This fort lies to the south-west of Kuh-i- Ghuch in a line with Ziarat-hKhwaja Sabari. It is like the mounds of Tappa- i-Kharan or Akbarabad, but is larger than Tappa-i-Kharan. It is almost rectan gular in shape. Inside the heaps resemble the remains of houses. Laro-e burnt bricks, 2^ feet X feet X 1^ inches, are found in plenty all over the place. But no trace of the canals can be found. The ditch around the fort is still there + -Tl- 6 * eve ' s s h°' v that it is impossible to irrigate Peshawaran from the Helmand. m ft anS f th !-^ Md i a D th j Where , the gt&gt;rge narrows - This occurs near Kala-i-Mir and Kala-i-R 0 den the site of the traditional Band-i-Yeko ; we have not found any trace of a masonry dam on the Helmand an, there is no reason to think there was any need of one.

The bed of the Hamun-i-Sabari is flat and very hard. In 1902 when the t,. c ,, . . „ Hamun dried the bed was found to be covered over with small and big shells, in such large quantities that men could not walk bare-footed on it. The bed is so hard that horses’ hoofs do not leave any mark on it. It is said that the bed of the Hamun-i-Sabari does not change except on its south-eastern shore. The bed proper, i.e., where the depth of water is not less than 5 feet (as measured from the level of the water in March 1905) does not change at all. The Sibari depression is too deep to allow the waves to scour the bed ; and whatever silt is brought down by the Farah Riid, Harud Rud and several other drainages on the western shore of the Sabari depression is carried into the Naizar near by the mouths of the streams and there deposited, the clear water only flowing into the Hamun-i-Sabari. Thus no silt is being deposit ed on the bed, nor is the bed being scoured. The wind plays an important part on the Hdmun-i-S 4 bari. It is changing The action of the wind on the waters of the the shape of the Sdbari depression on its Hdmun-i-Suban. south-eastern shore. Meshedi ’Ali says that he has been brought up on the shores of the S£bari, and has been there from his infancy till now. About twenty years ago the eastern shore of the Sdbari extended about half a mile further into the Hamun from Lurg-i-Autak-i-Kalan and Teshakani. The wind has been cutting this Lurg away and throwing the material east of the Lurg, filling up the shore of the Hamun-i-Garkando etc Now a Lurg of hardly 500 feet wide is left between the Hamun-i-Sabari and the Hamun*i-Garkando. At the place where this Lurg has been scoured away, the action of the Waves are scouring the lee shore. waves from the Hamun-i-S^bari is making deep small holes of varied size and depth quite close to one another. In 1902 when the Sabari dried up, these holes were prominent. ^ They were so close to each other that a man could not go across but by passing through them, and the area on which these holes has appeared is that from which the Lurg has been cut away during the last 20 or 25 years to a distance of about 3,000 feet. These holes are called by the Gaodars Chughur • and they are increasing every year in size. ' . T These Chughur are only on the south-eastern shore of the Sdbari depres sion between the Aukan and Lurg-i-Siahsar. They do not extend towards Bahnng. The wind forces the water towards the south and south-east, and drives it Depositing silt. into the Naizar; Lurg-i-Siahsar, Kang-i- * r ' n t rr Haidar and the Naizar about Lurg-i-Dak- i-Gaz Khoom-i-Gao and Mian Kang, as well as Kang-i-Gharutkhar catch a o- 0 od dea! of silt. Every time that a strong wind blows, some silt is deposited in this Naizar; and the clear water again flows back into the Hamun-i-Sabari In this way Lurg-i-Siahsar a narrow piece of Naizar projecting into the Hamun-i- Saban from Lurg-i-Takhtak is being raised and widened year by year Kanp--i Haidar was not so high formerly as it is now. It extended towards the north- west, on which side it is being scoured, but the southern end is being extended and the back or top of the Lurg too is being gradually raised. This is the nlace where the Hashmat-ul-Mulk keeps his private herd. P On the eastern shore near the Aukan the three Bash called Bash-i-Dilbar and Bash-i-Juwain and Bash-i-Jo Bakhsh were very deep, the silt from Rud-i- t^ket'of reeds 7 “ tHeSe A Bash is a very dense Along the banks of the Rdd-i-Gharutkhar one to two feet of soft silt in which the foot of a man sank, was seen when the lines of levels were bein? run on the south-eastern shore of the Sdbari depression in January ,90s fill was betng deposited m that season. The Gaodars of this locality said that only so5°4 [App. 23. Meshedi ’Ali had, through prudence, put all the tut and reed that he had got to make Ting (shelters) for the cattle in his hut, and so raised its floor by about 4 feet, he placed all his children on top of this, and was thus saved from the ice cold water. All the other Gaodars too had to take shelter in his hut. By midday about 3*0 feet of water rose on the top of the Lurg where the huts stood. The cattle were kept in the Ting or shelters so long as the water had not risen much. But when 3'o feet of water stood on the Lurg, the wind now and then caused the waves to rise over the cattle, who began to swim and were carried into Chung-i-Rogani; there the intense cold killed them all. During the day the water had not frozen. But when night came all the water froze. For four days and nights the wind blew strong. After that it dropt and the water^ began to flow back again into the H&amp;mun-i-Sabari. The men in Seistan had given up all the Gaodars for lost. When the wind stopped, they came to the lurga, cutting the ice with axes and tisha, and made a way for Meshedi ’Ali and others to come to Adimi. No human life of Meshedi ’All’s khel was lost except a little child who had fallen into the water. The khel on Mian Kang had 570 cows; all of them were drowned or killed by the cold. It was estimated that in all 450 men and 14,000 cattle were killed in the Naizar. Most of the Saiyads that had gone out for sport in the chung were killed by cold. For the first day and night the water of the Hamun-i-S£bari did not freeze. But after that every lap of the waves The waters of the Hamun-i-S^bari froze. that Came with the wind fr0Z e in layers till . the surface of the waters of the Hamun- i-Saban to a depth of about 2*5* feet froze solid. Muhammadi, brother of Ah, son of Ismail (Adimi), said that he had walked on the ice across the Saban from Lurg-i-Autak-i-Kalan to due west, and reached Sar-i-Nesh, the then end of Naizard-Khadromi, on the western shore of the Hamun-i-Sdbari.

Till the sleeping hour, there was neither rain nor wind, but at midnight rain began to fall; and at the same time the wind began to blow strong. The cold was intense. The drops of rain that fell on the reeds of the Naizar froze as they fell and the ends of the reeds became of + aTn ,sA/a is a word used in weaving for abobbin ‘ Mushla\ or cylindrical in shape.

Long before the flood came down, the water in the Naizar had risen and reeds had shot up green. The cattle moved freely in the Naizar to graze on the green tut and reed. Before the flood, the shela on Rah- i-Gardowak were running, but the road was open. The cattle were in thriving condition. The rains were early and extraordinary that year, and the grazing in the Naizdr and on the land was excellent. The people were not hungry. Six or seven weeks before Nauruz the water rose in the Naizar, and 'the people removed themselves and their cattle on to higher places. But again the water receded; and the men with their cattle again went into the Naiz^r. Six or seven days after Nauruz, under orders from the Amir, Kadkhuda Ali Murdd, Bandani, whose house was in Deh Kamali, sent round men and sowars in the Naizdr to inform all the Gdoddrs that a very big flood was coming down. A man reached Paran-i-Sufi in the evening. Meshedf ’Ali and his men moved them selves to several small pieces of gravel plain high above the bed of the Naizdr called Dashtak.* The next day the flood reached Rah-i-Gardowak. Meshedi remained on Dashtak for five days. The water spread all round Dashtak up to Mil-i-Nadir within three days of the time that it first reached Rah-i-Gardowak. Eight days afterf Nauruz, i.e. t on the day next to that on which Meshedi removed to Dash tak, Ali Murad, Bandani, himself came to Dashtak. He ordered the Saiydds to take all the tutin, and save those men and their families, who were perched on the higher places in the Naizar, and were so surrounded by water that they could not escape. He paid three kra?i for two tut in out of Government money. The tutin were large like those kept on the Rah-i-Tiratki. He also made proper arrangements with the Saiyads to keep tutin at all times on the road between Afzalabad and Mil-i-Nadir. Twelve days after Nauruz, i.e. } within six days of the time that the flood The highest level of the flood. first , r , ea , ched Kah-i-Gardowak the water reached the toe of the cliffs on the western bank. But 22 days after Nauruz, i.e. } 15 days after the water first reached Rah- i-Gardowak, the water rose to the highest level.} Between Dashtak and Mil-i- Nadir the depth of water was then about 4*5 feet. From Mil-i-Nadir to Afzalabad there was one sheet of water, all reed and tut having been submerged under water. The rainfall having been plentiful, the cattle fared well on the Dasht. There How the gaodar out off on the DaM fared. WaS , n0 diffic , ul ty obtaining fodder for the cattle after they were driven away from the Naizar. But the gaodar had nothing to eat. They had to go to Bandan to bring flour for themselves. For 20 days the people did not dare to go across the water on tutin. The water was above all reed and tut. There was no shelter from the wind and the lightest breeze caused a big wave, overturning the tutin and drowning everything on it. After 20$ days, however, the Saiyads gained courage by degrees and they began to bring flour, etc., from Seistan tor the gaodar on the western shore of the Hamun. A big kafila was coming into Seistan from Sarhad. They found the Sar-i- How the tutin were worked. £hela running in full force and not fordable. The kafila people rounded the Hamiin and came to Mil-i-Nadir. There, too, they found no crossing; and they remain ed half-starved near Mil-i-Nadir for about 20 days; one of the kafila, an Afghan, named Doran, who is still living in Seistan, was annoyed at this state of things, and asked the Saiyads to carry him and his asbab across the Hamun into * Colonel McMahon’s camp was pitched here in May 1903; at a certain stage of the Hamun tutin start from here; see Rah-i-Surkh gazi page 562 of Appendix 28. t The flood probably occurred on the 7th April. If so, this date is not correct, X Meshedi ’Ali says the flood water took 10 days to go from Rah-i-Gardowak to the Sar-i*Shela; flock-owners, who were on the shela, say it arrived four days after the Traku flood. $ Meshedi says he himselt came to Afzalabad with Kadkhuda Ali Murad on a tutin 16 days after Nauruz.

In the result when the tutin had reached nearly to the Shor Rud, a blast of wind came, the bales of cloth (four), some boxes of sugar and rice, etc., which belonged to Doran, all tumbled into the water, and the poor man was himself saved with much difficulty. The dodge to work the tutin at that time was to lash 20 to 30 large tutin together. The tutin were tied to one another and made into a long raft, four tutin wide and four or six long. All the asbab were tied on to the decks of the tutin. Expert Saiyads only were allowed to pole such a tutin. The distance w : as long. It took a whole day to cross the Hamun on this road.

In the The character of the spring flood. ?P ri . n £ °f 19 ° I too the rivers had not been In high flood ; therefore the Hamiin-i-Sabari was low in the spring of 1902. The flowing water reached as far as Buk-i-Sahib- dad and Chung-i-Sariim, but did not reach the Hamun-i-Sabari. Neither the Farah Rud nor Harud Rud brought water enough to reach the Hamun-i-Sabari. Six or seven weeks after Naurdz Meshedi ’Ali went on a tutin from Autak-i- Kalan to Kharika to pay fatiha or condolences on the death of a few relatives. He says that there was one had or about 60 of water in the Hamun-i-Sabari at its deepest part. Taking the depth of the Sabari in January 1905 to be 9 0 feet the Hamun at that time of the year 1902 was 3-0 lower than it was in fanuarv 1905. The water was drinkable. J ^ When the hundred and twenty days wind stopped, the water began to be- The state of the Hdmun before and after the Bad. COmC Undrinkable.

Still in the deeper portions of the Hamiin there was about 4-0 of water. One deep hole about 5 miles by 2J miles was north of Bahrino- opposite Sabz Kim ; and the other was opposite Kuh-i-Guch about ij miles by miles. ^ As the bed of the Hamiin-i-Sabari is not intersected by “ Lurga ” the water in different parts was not separated ; and when the wind blew all the water was mixed together and rendered brackish. ’ So long as the water was not so bitter, and men and cattle even reluctantly The fish. drank it, the fish had not suffered.

These two holes had some water even up to the time when fresh water from the Helmand reached the Sabari. The bed of the S^bari at all other places had completely dried up. The Sabari remained in this state for about four months. Chung-i-Garkando did not dry up till about one month after the water in , .v, .-i-j * , , . . the S£bari had become undrinkable. The The cools that did not completely dry up. . , , . . water remained drinkable till the last drop. . As no flood water reached the Naizar, the gaodars burnt the reeds in The Naizar&gt; almost all places. This was to clear the area and to allow the growth of new reeds. In 1902, though there was no water in the Naizar, the reeds sprouted and reached to a height of 4 to 6 feet; but did not bring forth flowers (bolak) except in solitary places. The cows fed on green reed as usual. Whatever portions of the Naiz&amp;r were left unburnt in the spring of 1902 were cleared by burning in the winter in the expectation of water. Excepting the Naizar at Bahring, Sabz Kim and certain small portions near Lurg-i-Tiratki, all the reeds of the Naizar were burnt. Reeds reach their full height in one year, so that now in 1905 those reed beds which were burnt down in 1902 areas thick as ever. Rud-i-Gharutkhar had a very large number of wells in its bed; and the „ . „ . • f A largest number of Maldars had settled themselves on this Rud. The water from these wells was sweet. The other places where the water from the wells was drinkable though not so sweet are Aukan-i-Galgalla near Khel-i-Kula Khan; Mian Tali at the tail of the Aukans; in Chungd-Alabakhsh near Autak-i-Kalan ; Shela-i-Teshakani; Bahring ; Sar-i-Sang and Shand-i-Daman to the south-west of the Kuh-i-Khwaja : at other places the water from the wells even if dug deep was not sweet. According to Meshedi ’Ali wherever sand appears at the bottom of the well, water is sweet ; otherwise it is brackish. This is the case all over the Seistan Delta* and not only in the bed of the inundated area. The cattle also drank water from the wells ; no mortality occurred among , T!ecaU]e those cattle that were collected here. They escaped the disease which destroyed the cattle in the villages and obtained just sufficient food and water to live till the scarcity ended. The effects of the strong wind in January igog and in March igog. On the 18th January 1905, the morning was clear; but after 10 a.m. the weather became cloudy ; and a light wind Strong wind at the end of January. began to blow. I hlS Wind Stopped towards the evening at Adimi. On the 19th, it remained cloudy the whole day ; and the wind also blew, getting strong towards the afternoon. In the evening thick clouds appeared in the sky, and a few drops of rain fell at Adimi. The 20th morning was clear and the sun appeared. There was no wind. Lala Thakur Dass, Babu Amir Singh and Babu Hari Singh of the Irrigation Establishment were in camp at Adimi just on the edge of the Naizar. About 10 A.M. the clouds appeared, and the wind began to blow suddenly followed by rain. The work of levelling was stopped. The rain stopped, but the wind gained in severity. It rose high and reduced the temperature. This strong wind continued day and night till the evening of the 23rd January 1905. In the evening almost every day the wind lowered a little. At Adimi the canal froze and men and goats easily passed over it without breaking the ice. The Nairez or the road which goes from Adimi to Dahana-i-Riid-i-Farah via Lurg-i- Teshakani and Autak-i-Kalan was all frozen, and cattle could not pass for fear of breaking their legs. Gaodars on urgent work only went to and came from Lurg-i. Teshakani towards the City. This wind did not lead to the loss of any human life or cattle. * The wells at Chah Muhammad Raza are in a local sand bed buried under the silt of the inundated area. Those Girdi Naluki etc. are in sand beds in old river beds.508 [App. 23.

(“ Overland Journey to India). He describes the stream as stirrup deep flowing with force in a clear stream of 150 yards wide. He says the rise of the Helmand commences in winter, much rain falling at that season, the stream is swelled to great depth and breadth in spring, when the snow melts and on the quantity of snow that falls on the mountains during winter depends its fulness and rapidity. So much snow fell during the cold season of 1829, and winter broke up so suddenly, that very early in the next spring a great torrent came down from the mountains, which at night swept everything away, and flooded the whole country on the right bank of the river. With reference to this flood the following extract from Rawlinson’s “Notes on Seistan ” (page 279 of the Royal Geographical Society’s Journal, January 27th, 1873) is of interest and importance :— “Captain Connolly, who was in Seistan in 1839, learnt on the spot that the Helmand first broke into its present bed {i.e., the bed of 1873 at the time of the Goldsmid award) nine years before, or in 1830, the main stream previous to that date having probably passed by Kimmak and Chilling to the lake in the vicinity of Koh-i-Khoja.” Connolly himself says—“ About nine years ago an unusually large inundation changed the whole face of the country. The main stream of the Helmand deserted its old bed, and cutting for itself a wide channel out of that .

Dadf, Kadkhuda-i-Kaldn, who thinks he was born in 1839, the year Sh£h Kamran came to SeistAn, and the Arb£b Saif-ud-din, who thinks he was born 8 or 10 years earlier, say that they do not remember this flood themselves, but they have always heard it spoken of as a great flood like that of 1885; these were the only two extraordinary floods they could recollect to have heard of. No other old people we met could recollect any ether such floods. The flood of 1830 is said to have extended to the Kurdo Fort and to have levelled many old ruins lying between Kala-i-Guwak and Kalad-Kurdo, so that many coins, etc., were found after the flood passed away by those, who went to search for them. Such searchers are locally called Daghal gardi, z&gt;., those v\ ho roam on level open bare plains, the coins being found, as a rule, on level open hard stretches of land littered with minute fragments of pottery; they are seldom or never found in the ruins themselves. 1832. —The dam on the Karun river at Shuster is said to have been breached in this yvax—vide Lord Curzon’s Persia, Volume II, page 374. /tS’j#.—Arb£b Saif-ud-din says when the British took Kabul and Kandahar Khushk SdI the river very nearly dried up ; only a small stream like a canal flowed in the river after the wheat crop was harvested. In that year the Arbab went with his relatives to Kandahar and met Colonel Leach. The river began to rise again about the5 12 [App. 24 - # usual time. Grain was exported from Garmsel to Kandahar ; before the export began the price of grain was one Seistdni man a kran but, the export made grain scarce and dear and the price became i-J man Kandahar or 45 sir Seistdni per Indian rupee (6f Indian seers a rupee). The rate of exchange was 4 Indian rupees for 5 Kabulis. Major Todd crossed the Helmand at Girishk on an elephant on the 3rd June 1838 and says it was a broad exceedingly rapid formidable river, the water bein&lt;y at places 7 feet deep.— (Astatic Society's Journal Volume 13). 18 39 -—Captain Sanders, Bengal Engineers, crossed the Helmand at Girishk on the 27th June 1839. His account of the river has already been given in Appendix 21 in the description of the ford at Girishk. /c£/2.—The masonry dam on the Karun River was breached in this year—• vide Lord Gurzon’s Persia, page 374, Volume II. /c?45.—General Perrier* reached Girishk in September 1845 and spent some time in those parts; finally he arrived at Khan Nishin in October 1845 and travelled down the Helmand to Jahanabad and went thence through Jalalkbdd to Dashtak, where he crossed the river on a raft, travelled through Daulatabad Sihkuha, Kundar to Ser Jadda (sic) where he rounded the Hamun and travelled along its western shore to Lash Juwain. Ser Jadda he says &lt;f is the most southern extremity of the lake. In riding down the river he says, they repeatedly forded the river to shorten the journey. But having occasion to cross from the right to the left bank somewhere above “ the point where the Helmand diverges into several streams of water ” he crossed on a raft. s . Dashtak, he says, “ is situated on the banks of the Helmand which at this point is very deep and 300 yards wide. Having crossed the river on a reed (sic) raft we made our way through the brush wood and cultivation and entered the desert passing Daulatabad arrived at Sehkoha, where we spent the nieht with Sardar Muhammad Reza Khan with whom I was travelling.” S ( He , rou ' de ^ th f ^ ke 44 miles south of Sihkoha (Kundar being half way) The ford at the head of the Sar-i-Shela at Tump-i-Mir Dost whfre General Goldsmid crossed the Hamun on his way from Bam to Seistan is a little short ° r eSe u m I • S , U -aT- entS Y a, ] d the ford across ‘he Sar-i-Shela on the trade route at Gumbad-i-Liddi is a little more than the measurements.

So General Ferrier had to round the southern end of the Haman. Cr naa Th is was a year of cholera. General Ferrier was present at a cholera riot at Kandahar m August and saw people dying of cholera in the snow on his return to Tehran m the winter ot 1845-46. icuun General Perrier’s notes lead us to think that the main stream of the river flowed west past Dashtak to the Hamiin near the Kuh-i-Khwaia which woufd account for the large amount of water in the Southern Hamun. The road o the north, which was open was probably the one from Takht-i-Shah to Pesh*. waran across the Shela-.-Mesh-Kush, the more direct road from Kala UNau £ r rfn H WaS Pr ° bab,y fl00ded ' But Captain Connolly says that in 1830 the Helmand main stream went to the Duk-i-Tp^r /tu,- • Puzak Hamun, the Dak-i-Tir being the cliffs on the ^tlh^t J^Append x 32.) The main stream could not have returned again in the short period of , years. The large flow in the western branch was therefore due to the diierskm of the water down that channel by the annual band which we are told by thf oeonte Sardar Muhammad Reza Khan, Sarbandi, built annually.

The floods must have been extraordinary or the Rah-i-Gardowak would have been available. i8$q .—The Afghans are said to have invaded Seistan and in the confusion no crops were sown. The Akhundzada’s brother, Muhammad Salih Khan, was Hakim of Herat. Ibrahim Khan killed Dad Shah of Margo. Muhammad Khan, Ala Kazi, nephew of Wazir Yar Muhammad Khan, took Chakhansur and Sardar Ibrahim Khan fled to Rudbar. Sardar Kamal Khan, who had hitherto lived at Kala Kharan, now built Kala-i-Bandar-i-Kamal Khan/ In the previous winter (1858-59) there was a heavy fall of snow which lasted Sel-i-Kalan. * WGek » lt WaS 2 * eet thick and 0n ground for 20 days. The old Arbab Saif-ud-din, who remembers the heavy fall of snow in the winter of 1858-59, says that after the snow melted the river was in high flood, but it left no impression on the minds of the people, because no crops were grown during the war and all the cattle had been raided and carried off. Dadi, once a kadkhuda kalan of Afghan Seistan, a Bamri Farsi, who is an old man, about 70 years of age, who has built many canals and made the annual band on the lower branches of the River Helmand since he was a boy, says he re members but one red flood of rain water in the summer months, and it occurred in the summer after the snowfall above alluded to, which was the heaviest fall of snow he remembers. He says that in Loar in the chilla of bad-i- s.i-i-Ab Surkh. S ar m, about the middle of July, a big flood came down the river about the same as an ordinary spring flood ; the w'ater continued to rise for three days, but on the 4th day it began to fall, and in three or four days had again subsided. The flood came about the time of the ripening of melons, but not too late to sow a second late crop, which w^as done and an abundant harvest of melons was secured. These melons ripened in 50 or 60 days. Owing to the strife in the land the band had not been made in the previous year, and there was very little water in the Rud-i-Seistdn when the flood came. But this flood filled all the canals. The flood was due to rainfall in the valleys of the tributary rivers of the Helmand. The water was so thick and red that people could not drink it; they had to dig wells. The layer of silt then deposited can still be distinguished by its bright red colour when it is met with in excavations. The members of the Mission noticed that on 2nd of July 1903 the water of the Helmand suddenly became red; the volume increased that day from 10,350 to 10,950 cusecs. The spring of 1903 was one of exceptional rain in Afghanistan and Persia and the summer was an exceptionally wet one in Kashmir and Northern India. The expression Sel-i-ab-surkh is applied by the Arbab Saif-ud-din to floods that are very red in colour that come in the spring. He says that sickness always follows such floods, and for this reason such very red floods are sometimes called db gasht or water that is changed. Early in April 1904 such a flood came down the river and lasted four days. In 1866, and again in 1884, the old Arbab says the water at one period of the spring floods was so thick and red that careful people dug wells and drank well water; those who did not, suffered much from sickness. He says these floods come from the Tarnak and Dhuri, where there is much red soil, and also many snakes. The people believe that it is the pieces of the bones of the snakes taken with the thick water that produce the sickness. 1864. —The flood was a little less than in 1903. The Hamiin*i-Kuh-i-Khwaja Sei-i-Kai 4 n. was full and some water went down the Sar-i-Shela. It was a prosperous year and is known as the year before Muzuffar-ud-Daula came to Seistan. 1865. —The flood was like that of 1903. The Sar-i-Shela began to flow before Sei-i-Kaian. ^ Bud-i-sad-o-bist-ru3 began to blow, as the Hamiin was already full. It was a C639FD LL5 i 4 [ App. 24. year of political happenings in Seist^n. Mir Alam Khan of Kain took Jahan&amp;bad. Two months after Naurtiz Sharif Khan, Nahruf, retreated from Seistan by the road that crosses the Sar-i-Shela at Cardan Reg and found that it was not ford able. About 20 days later Muzuffar-ud-Daula crossed from Mil-i-Nadir by the Rah-i-Taratki on tutin. Tilfak at that time was a dag ha l, i.e., flat bare plain and was chosen by the Muzuffar-ud-Daula for the site of his city. This city was soon destroyed by the floods, and only the remnants of some of the buildings remain on the left bank of the Rud-i-Parian. The Gaud-i-Zireh received water. No water went down the Trakti channel. 1866 —Major St. John* says the rains of the winter of 1865-66 w T ere good, whereas from 1863-64 to 1870-71 all other winter rains were below the average. Arbab Saif-ud-din says the flood this year was like that of 1904, but some water flowed down the Sar-i-Shela. 1870 —Major St. John says that in the winter of 1869-70 hardly any snow fell in Persia. Following on previous years of drought flocks and herds died all over Persia.f Lakes, springs, and kanat all over Persia got lower and lower each summer from 1863-64 onwards. 1871. —Major St. john says the rains of 1870-71 were again very scanty in the north and east of Persia. 1 he Arbdb Saif-ud-din says the flood at Nauruz w r as a little less than in Khushk Sal (river dried op). ' 9 ° 4 : A . * 1 the time of the bad-i-garm and loar i t.e., July and August, the river practically dried up, only a small quantity equal to the volume of a small canal flowed in the bed. The river thus remained nearly dry for 3 months. At winter the volume gradually increased. The Sabari Hamlin is said to have dried up and dead fish formed a high bank along the shore. Caravans numbering thousands of camels came and carried off the grain of Seistan to the famine stricken areas of Persia. 1872. The Goldsmid Mission arrived in Seistan on the 1st February 1872 Khushk su and left by the middle of March. Major St. John says that the winter rains com menced early and were heavy and there was a good fall of snow. Major Euan Smith said that there had been only poor floods in the rivers for the previous 3 or 5} years; only detached stagnant pools remained in the Hamun ; the bunnun^ grass was becoming less and less and threatened to cease to grow, because no inundations had reached the head of the Sar-i-Shela for about 5§ years. Major Euan Smith says that for three years the Helmand supply had been little more than enough for the Rud-i-Seistan. On the 19th|| February he remarked that the water in the river was unusually low for this particular season of the year and had been so for the past two years. The Mission marched out of Seistan, in the middle of March, across the Hamun from Bunjar through Deh Rahdar to Peshawaran, and their reports! describe the plain as quite dry. But Captain Beresford Lovett who went from Chakhansur to Lash at this time found the Kash in flood and water in the Puzak Hamun. The Baluchis say that the floods this year were much less than in 1904, but the crops were average. 1873 *—The floods of this year were like those of 1904. The crops did Kdlabit well.

For an account of this rebellion see the report by Lieutenant the Hon’ble H. D. Napier of his journey to Seistan in 1893 (Foreign Department Proceedings, July Ib93, Nos. 176-181.) 1874. The floods were about the same as in 1904, but at the end of July the Deh Karimdad and Sharifabad the water was only 2 feet deep and its volume is estimated at half that of the river in 1904 in July and August, i he supply at the time of sowing wheat was deficient, but the river afterwards rose gradually. The year is described as a dry one. The Samsam-ul-Mulk is said to have come to Seistan this year, and Sharif Khan fled to Nad-i-Ali, where he obtained a grant from the Amir Abdur Rahman. He commenced to dig the Kalad-Fath canal. 18J5 .—Although the river rose at highest flood to much the same height as the river was a low one the whole season. At the end of the hot time {loar) } i.e., end of August, there was only 2| feet of water on the fords.

The crops at Kuh-i- Khwaja and other places were des troyed. One month before Nauruz the river was in full flood. As in 1903, the river was full till the time when the reaping of crops was finished. The river fell slowly, and the fords ap peared late as in x 9 ° 3 - There was ample water at the harvest of melons. The river was Ba- kaida or at its ordinary level at the time of sow ings. The sowings were done in time in Seistan. Amal and Gulmir guides say that Taj Mu hammad Khan burnt the Band-i- Seistan and sow ings of wheat were not done properly. Also the winter floods were not nor mal. They fell short of the demand. 1878. Kalabi The river was within its banks at the time of flood. The volume was less than in 1904. The flood passed away very soon, even sooner than in 1904. The flood lasted long enough to ripen melons, but the river fell soon. The Bandar-i-Kamal Khan in Garmsel and the Jharuki canals did not get any water as the flood of 1877 had blocked their channels with silt. At the time of sow ings, the water in the river just met the demand. The sowings were done in time. The fords appeared very soon. Only a small area of melons and millet was sown as the river was not high enough for early sowings. 1879. Kalabi ... The river at flood time flowed within its banks. The flood was less than in 1*78, and much less than in 1904. There were a few low floods which passed away soon. The river had water enough to ripen the melons. The fords became unfordable only for some days. The river generally remained fordable at good fords. The river had suffi cient water at the time of sowings, which were done at the proper time. * Remark to /&lt;S77.—The heavy fall of snow occurred two months beiore Nauru* on the Id and lip nvo feet thick on the Dasht. Many cattle and sheep died of cold. Sardar Kamal Khan only saved his crops in the bed of the Traku depression by vigorously making a band across the head of the depression near the Kabristan. Young locusts are said 'to have destro\ed the autumn crops; owing to fighting, the floods and locusts the food supply was deficient. ^App. 24 -] 517 II. of the River Helmand, the Hamun, the Sav-i-Sheia and Gauct-i-Zirek.

The level of water in the Hamun before the flood of 1877 was about the same as in March 1903, i e., the level was very low. The flood of 1877 filled up the Hamun to over, flowing like that of 1903. The Sar-i-Shela flowed for 4 months. For 3 months it was Zinda ab or flowed itself. In the fourth month it ran when the wind blew strong. Safar, son of Nur Din, says that the Sar-i-Shela continued flowing with the wind till the end of the Bad- i-sad-o-bist ruz of the next year. The deep part of Gaud- i-Zireh was filled down to Ziarat-i-Sultan. * General Sir Charles MacGregor and Cap tain Lockwood visited Gumbad-i-Shah-i-Mak sud where the road from Bandar to Kirtaka crosses the Sar-i-Shela on 22nd February 1877 and found the Gaud-i- Zireh and Sar-i-Shela quite dry. They got water to drink by dig ging in the bed of the Shela. * Vide his “Wanderings in Baluchistan.” The Hamun was full before the flood. The flood of 1878 filled the Hamun to the point of overflowing ; but not so much as to cause the Sar-i-Shela to flow of its own accord. The Sar-i-Shela did not flow of itself, but when the wind was strong the water was driven into the Gaud-i-Zireh. For the 4 months of Loar or hot wind, the Sar-i- Shela continued in flow with the wind when it was strong. The deep part of the Gaud-i-Zireh was full; and received some more water in 1878. Maldar had settled them selves on Gaud-i-Zireh. The Hamun was full as in 1905 before the flood time. # The flow of 1879 added some water to the Hamun which reached Regowak. But the Sar-i- Shela did not flow, not even with the strongest wind. The Sar-i-Shela did not flow at all. The’ deep part of the Gaud-i-Zireh had still some water. (C639FD] MM5 i 8 [App 24. Year.

(Gulmir and Dadi sa}' that the river rose higher than 1904) in The river rose often at flood time; but fell soon. It did not rise higher than it did in April and May 1905. But Gulmir says the river rose a little higher than in 1904. The river rose higher than in 1881, about the same as the flood of 1904. The river did not rise higher than 1882. It was less than in 1904. The flood was less than in 1882 and 1883, so much le‘s that in some places they had to intro duce Mehruz on the canals, i.e., to distri bute water by turns. This is seldom done at the time of ri pening of the wheat crop. When the water is generally more than sufficient in Seistan. The cultivators matured the wheat and left the barley to perish in such places, where they could not get water for all the standing crops. The area that suffered was however very small. Duration of flood. For two months be fore and after Nau ruz, the river was full. Except some good fords high up the river all ether fords oisappeared. But in the third month the river fell, and the fords ap peared, but the river was full. The river kept rising and falling for about two months after Nauruz. The fords disappeared only for a short while. It rose in time to give sufficient water to mature the wheat crop and kept on rising and falling for about two months. The river fell soon and fords appeared. The flood lasted for a short while. The river rose and fell successively as in 1905 for about six months. The flood came and passed away like that of 1905, or even less than that. This alternative rising and falling continued for about one month, when the river fell to its ordinary level. Period of low river. The melons and millet got sufficient water in Seistan. No damage was done to the wheat crop this year. The river fell gradually, and became very low; but at the time of making the Band-i- Seistan it had sufficient water for wheat sow ings. No damage was done to the wheat crop, nor did any melons or millet die for want of water. The Seistanis say Ja-wab dada ivatan ra; i.e., met the demands of the people and did not rise higher. No damage was done to crops. The river fell very low at the time of band-mak ing ; but it rose soon and wheat, sow ings were done pro perly. The Seistanis say that Ab ba farman bud, i.e., the river was under control. It did not do any damage, but had sufficient water to meet all demands. The area of melons and millet sown was much less than in ordinary years, as the flood w’ater did rot inundate the lands. The early faliz ripened all right. The late sowings were all lost for want of wa ter; villages like Khw'aja Ahmed and Sharifabad suffered much. But otherwise the year was a pros perous one. The rate of grain was low as usual ; and there was no scarcity of food, nor did prices rise in the following w inter. Winter floods. The sowings were done at the proper time. There was no scarcity of w-ater. The wheat crops received proper waterings. The river had suffi cient water at the time of sowing wffieat. The river had suffi cient water to ripen the wheat crop.

At the time of mak ing the Band-i-Seis- tan the river was Ba kaida, i e., it had an ample supply to meet all demands.

The water extended to Regowak. The flood of 1880 filled up the Hamun to over flowing. All the Nai- zars were under water. The Sar-i-Shela flowed for one month without the help of the wind ; and for one month it flowed with the strong wind. Meshedi Ali crossed the Sar-i-Shela at Gardan Reg, whilj it was flowing. The Gaud-i-Zireh did not receive any water as the water did not go beyond Rah-i-Shamshiri on the Sar-i-Shela. The above two statements do not tally. In 1903 the water went to the very end of the Sar-i- Shela and the flow did not last two months. Probably the Gaud-i- Zireh received some water. The Hamun was not so full as in 1880 before the flood time. The flood of 1881 had but little effect on the Hamun which was full to the satisfaction of the Gaodars. The Sar-i-Shela did not flow this year. No water reached the Gaud-i-Zireh this year. Colonel Maitland was told on the 25th October 1884 at Ziarat Padah Sultan that three years before [i.e., either in 1881 or 1882) the flood waters spread over the plain at the Ziarat. This would be a flood as big as that of 1903, which according to the Seistanis had not occurred since 1877. The Hdimun was ‘ Ba kaida, ’ i.e., was full to the satisfaction of the Gaodars. The Hamun had fallen much before the flood of 1883. The Hamun had fallen a good deal and the Gaodars had penetrated into the Naizar around the deep Chung. The Hamun rose a little by the flood of 1882; but it had fallen during the previous year. The flood of 1883 added some water to the Hamun, but it did not rise high. Still there was enough water for the Gaodars purposes. The flood of 1884 had no effect on the Hamun. The fresh water did not reach the tail of the Hamun, yet there was no complaint for want of grazing among the Gaodars. No water flowed into the Sar-i-Sheia. The Sar-i-Shela did not flow. The Sar-i-Shela did not flow at all. No water reached the Gaud-i-Zireh this year. It had become quite dry. The Seistani seldom or never visits the Gaud-i- Zireh when it is dry or nearly dry and he does not speak on this point from personal knowledge. No water reached the Gaud-i-Zireh. No water reached the Gaud-i-Zireh. Puzak Hamun round which the Mission marched did not appear to have been so great as when we saw it in February 1904, and as it then received the main volume of the Helmand it should have been very full if, 1884 had been a year of great flood.520 [App. 24.

In the upper reaches of the Helmand it rose 15 to 20 feet above the level of the flood of 1903; all the tama risk that grows on the banks of the river is said to have been covered under water. The Tara- ku old bed carried a large volume of water. In Persian Seistan many vil lages were destroy ed. The probable date of the flood was about the 7th of April. The flood was bigger than that of 1904. It did no damage to crops ; but flooded as usual a large area for the sowings of melons. The flood was like that of 1904, if not less than that. The river did not over flow its banks and did no damage. The flood was higher than in 1904; but it did no damage to the wheat and bar ley crops. In the month of “Ghous” or December, a flood had come down suddenly and overtook the Gao- dars, who had pene trated into the Naizar. There was some loss of cattle and human life too. The level of the water from this flood reached the Kuh-i-Khwaja. The Hamlin again fell and the people again penetrated into the Naizar. 30 days before Nauruz, the Hamun began to rise, as the river was very full. For 53 days the river was very high, i.e., for 30 days before and 23 days after Nau ruz ; after this the river began to be about normal for the time of the year in great floods For 4 months more the river was full and the volume was large like it was after the flood of 1903. For three months the river was in flood, i e., rose and fell alternately, as it did in 1904. In the fourth month, too, it kept a high level after which it fell. The river rose and fell alternately for 6 or 7 weeks after Nauruz. The peo ple in Seistan itself did quite well, but in the Garmsel prices were still at famine rates; at Nauruz, wheat sold at 20 sir Seistani and barley 30 sir Seistani a kran. For three months the river rose and fell alternately. It began to rise some weeks before Nauruz. Period of low river. The river at the time of the sowings of wheat was full, i.e., had more water than in ordinary years. The winter floods, were as desired; wheat was sown as usual and the crops came up all right. The wheat and barley crop of many villages that came in the way of the river was des troyed. Early sow ings of melons could not be made; but the people sowed melons and millet when the river fell. On the banks of the Hamun a large area of melons was sown. People say that never had such an immense quantity of melons been grown in Seistan as in this year. The river was full to the banks for a great part of Loar or the 4 months of the hot wind, when it gradu ally fell, till the time that the Band-i-Seis- tan was made. The people found it diffi cult to make the band, but the band was made and the wheat sowings of the ensuing season were done in good t me. Mr. Merk was told that the band was not re paired that year. The river had sufficient In the winter the river Winter flood. water to ripen the melons and millet. The spring and autumn crops matured all right. No damage was done. The sup ply in the river at the time of wheat sowings was good. The river assumed its ordinary level very, soon this year; but had its usual supply when the band was made. Wheat sow ings were done in good time. Melons and millet were good and in abundance. For two months of the hot wind the river was above its ordinary level. Afterwards it fell and remained at its ordinay level. At the time of wheat sow ings the supply was quite sufficient ; and sowings were done properly. Melons and millet ripened proper- Jy. was at its ordinary level. The wheat crop received fuff waterings and no complaints were heard. In the winter the volume of the river W'as good and no complaints were heard of scarcity of w'ater. The winter floods were as usual. No damage was done to crops. The sup ply in the river was good.

Sar-i-Shela. State of the H&amp;tntin before the flood. Before the big flood came the Hamlin was not very full. The Gaodars had penetrated into the Naizar to the Chung that were deep and had much water. But the rise of the river in De cember 1884 had added much water to the Nai- zar, so that before the big flood at the Nauruz of 1885, the Hamiin was Ba kaida, i.e., had enough water for all the purposes of the Gacdars. The Hamiin was already almost full,so the flood of 1886 filled it to the point of overflowing, so that flood water reached to the head of the Sar-i- Shela. The Hamiin was full as in the year 1903 at spring time. The Hamiin was well filled as in the year 1904 at Nauruz. The flood rapidly filled the Hamlin and 23 da\ s after Nauruz it was full to overflowing. The city of Nasratabad was saved by making a pro tection band to cut off the waters from the out lets of the Rud-i-Seistan which were collecting around the City ; it was also feared that the Hamun might rise so high as to flood the City. The Hamiin was full to its furthest limits at all places. Tut in w’orked from Afzalabad to the Mil-i-Nadir only. The reeds in most places were hidden under water. The flood filled the Hamiin to the level at which the water was just on the point of overflow ing. The flood of 1887 filled the Htfmiin down to the head of the Sar-i-Shela. Some say that the floods did not raise the level of the water in the Hamun very much, and that the water did not reach even as far as Regovvak. But Amal says that the Hamun viasfull. The Sar-i-Shela began to flow on the 23rd day after Nauruz, and con tinued flowing with much force for 3 months. During the first month no one dared to go across the Sar-i-Shela either on rafts or on skins. In the fourth month it still flowed without the assistance of the wind, but the depth of water had decreased. After the fourth month it flow ed with the wind. No tutin are ever made for work on the Sar-i- Shela. The people make rafts of gourds and skins to take sheep and themselves and their goods across. The Sar-i-Shela did not flow of its own accord, but only when the wind blew. Safar says that it kept flowing with the wind throughout the year 1885-86. A mal says water reached the Gaud-i'Zireh of its own accord in 18S6 also. The Sar-i-Shela did not flow of its own accord, but on days of ex ceptionally strong wind, some water passed into the ^hela and filled up the holes in its bed. Some Baluchis say that the Sar-i-Shela did not flow at all, but Amal says that it flowed for some time and water reached the Gaud-i- Zireh in appreciable quantities,as the Hamun was full and wind strong.

At the time of making the Band-i-Seistan the river fell very low, but there was suffi cient water for wheat sowing as in 1904. But silt had deposited in the Rud-i-Seistan from Burj-i-Sarband to Dashtak. The cultivators had to clear out this silt.

The Hamun was low before the flood of 1889. But it had sufficient water for all the pur poses of the Gaodars. Effect of flood on the Hamun. The flood of 1889 filled the Hamun to such an extent that the Shelas on Rah-i-Gardowak flowed for some time. Before the flood of 1890 the water in the Naizar nearly dried up. Water remained only in the Chung or deepest pools. The Hamun was very low as in the winter of 1902. Only the C/zhwj- or pools held water. The Hdmun was as low before the flood as it was in 1904.. The flood sent some water into the Naizar, but it had no appreci able effect on the Hamun, which was very low. The big- floods filled up the Naizar and the Hamun was full down to Regowak.

The flood of 1892 filled up the Naizar and the Hamun down to the head of the Sar-i-Shela. For about a month water flowed into the Sar-i- Shela with the strong wind. For 8 or 9 days it passed across the Gardan Reg Ford; but generally the water w r as spent in filling holes above the Gardan Reg Ford.

On the left of the road water and reeds alternated. The road was a clearing through very high and dense reeds. There had recently been rain ; from this description I judge that the floods must have retreated later in the year from the road than they did in 1903 and theretore that the flow to the Sar-i-Shela lasted much longer5 2 4 [App. 24.

The river fell very soon this year. 1894. The melons and millet however got enough water and the crops were not much below the average except in theShib-i-Ab. At the time of making the band, the supply be came very low, and sowings of wheat were delayed. Supply in the river rose late and sow ings of wheat were done.

Some say the year cannot be called a year of high floods and that the river was lower than in 1904 and like the river in April of 1905, while others say the floods were higher than in 1904 The flood came now and then and passed away soon. The duration of the flood was not so long as that in 1904. The wheat and barley crops were ripened proper, ly ; and melons an I millet were sown as usual, though there was no self-flooded area. The melons received water to mature them, but soon after the river fell very low, and at the time of the iawJ-making the sup ply was far less than usual. The sowings of wheat were done very late. In the winter the ri ver had less than its normal supply, and the crops did not receive proper waterings. In De cember and Janua ry, i.e., Chtlla-i- Kalan the water supply was not ade quate.

The volume of maxi mum flood ap proached that of 1903. During the first month the rise was not much. In the 2nd month it rose very high ; and after two months more the river fell to its normal level. Melons and millet were sown exten sively. At the time of ripen ing of the wheat crops of 1891-95, the river was low for two months. After the spring floods, it remained at its nor mal level. At the time of band-mak‘ ing it was at its usual level. 1896. In Chilla-i-Kalan, i.e., in January the supply in the river was below normal. The water of Rud- i-Sei'stan was distri buted by turns. This the people call IVushk. They allowed a certain period to the vil- ages of the Pusht-i- Ab Mahal and then to Shib-i-Ab. The canals too were worked on the same system. The crops of the villages near the Kuh-i-Khwaja suffered a good deal. In ChtlLa-i- Khurd, i.e., in Feb ruary the river be gan to rise and all complaints about water were removed. The wheat sowings were done in time. Sel-i-Kalan. (Autumn, winter, spring rainfall at Quetta 8‘90 inches.) The flood was higher than in 1903. It did some damage to crops sown on lands subject to high floods. For one month the river was full as in the flood 1903 and for the next two months it ran with in its banks, but fords did not ap pear till late in the season. The melon and millet crops received proper waterings; but at the time of harvesting the wheat, locusts ap peared which des troyed all the young melons and millet. Only in some places, the melons escaped destruction; at the time of wheat sowing the supply in the river was the same as in 1904 and quite suffici ent for sowing. The winter floods were normal. The wheat crop received full waterings. Remarks to /S94—Colonel Yate visited Seistar from January to March. He crossed from Bahring to Afral a bad m the dn.

Effect of flood oh the Hamun. The flood in 1893 had no appreciable effect on the H£mun, which continued falling dur ing the year. The flow had little effect on the Hamun ; water was left only in the deep Chung. The Hamun was full to overflowing. The flood filled dll the Naizar, and the water in the Hamun extend ed to the Hauzdar and Kundar ruins. The flood of 1896 filled the Hamun to overflow ing ; Meshedi AH says that a westerly wind blew suddenly when the Hamun was full, and breached the protection band at Ziarat Pir Sabz near Deh Muhammad Safar.

Remark to 7895.—The flood burst the left protective embankment running from Shahgul to Milak- the flood water destroyed the crops of Tilfak and joined the main river near Maliki and thus escaped to the N'aizar. This flood embankment was built by Sardar Khan Jan Khan to protect Jahanabad and was noticed by Major Euan Smith on his ride .from Kuhak to Nad-i-Ali and also by Colonel Yafe on his way to Milak. After the flood subsided the embankment was repaired by the people of Jahanabad and Tilfak. This was the last year Shela-i-Jahanabad or Pokuk carried water to Maliki and Dikki. Remarks to 1896 .—At Nauruz abig flood came down the river which according to Shahdad, who has lived at Bandar-i-Kamal Khan all his life, was 175 feet higher that the flood of 1903.

Effect of flood on the Hamun. Sar-i-Shela. Gaud-i-Zireh. The Hamun was full, and the Gaodars had all that they required. The Hamun had fallen but at the Kuh-i-Khwaja and upwards it had ample water for all the purposes of the Gaodars The floods of 1897 added some water to the Ha- m un, but they had very little effect on its ex tent. The flood added some fresh water to the Naizar down to the Kuh-i-Khwaja. Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh crossed 011 tutin in May 1898 on his way from Meshed to Seistan. He got into tutin at Dash- tak and must have cross ed by the Rah-i-Surkh Gazi (see Appendix 28) for he said all the traffic went by Dashtak, till the water on this route became shallow when it would revert to Bah- ring. The extent of water was about 12 mile«. and the passage took 6 hours, the landing was two miles short of Afzal- abad. The water was from 4 to 7 feet deep. This shows that the flood level in the Hamun north of the Rah-i-Gardawak must have reached the level it did in 1903. But the overflow into the Kuh-i- KhwajajH&amp;mun was not so great as in 1903, as the water was only suffi cient to reach the head of the Sar-i-Shela in a high wind. The Sar-i-Shela did not flow. Gaud-i-Zireh received no water.

Gaud-i Zireh received no water. He was told that for the . m . » last 10 • Not correct. m years* no water had flowed down the Sar-i-Shela and the Gaud-i-Z!reh had nearly dried up. By the middle of August there was great scarcity of water, especially on the Rud-i-Seistan as the band was said not to have been properly repaired in 1896. The repairs of the band were not made till October. Local Baluchis think the floods were as good as those of 1904 and the crops both Rabi and Kharif were satisfactory and no losses were sustained. »Major Brazier Creagh’s remarks give the impression that the floods were higher than in 1904, as on the 7th June he records that the river was in high flood (stc) at the Parian Ford at Milak and he lost a horse crossing. There were 6,000 cusecs at the Parian on 7th June 1904 hardly enough to cause the drowning of a horse. The Mission lost no horses by drowning. J Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh met the Hashmat-ul-Mulk in Meshed in April 1898 and was told that the Band-i-Seistan had been damaged by floods and the area under cultivation had been considerably reduced ow’ing to insufficiency of water and the crops had suffered from blight. If the batd were badly gapped by a high and early flood and then the river fell very low there might be difiicultyin maturing crops. But the difficulty could be entirely overcome by action to be initiated by the Hashmat for the repairs of the or the regulation of the canals. The Hashmat was complaining of the exactions of the Persians and may have greatly exaggerated the damage to crops. The floods of 1897-98 must have been large enough in total volume to nearly fill the Northern Hamun for Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh had to take tutin to cross the inundated area from Dashtak near Bahring to Afzalabad in May 1898, vide Confidential Report made in 1S98 by the Khan Bahadur on his journey from Meshed to Quetta.528 [App. 24 Year.

The best fords in the (parm- sel remained ford able throughout the year. The wheat in the tract irrigated by the canals around the Kuh-i- Khwaja did not all get water to mature. In some few villages too barley did not re ceive the last watering. The distribution of water in the Rud-i- Seist^n was made by turns called mehruz. T\\Qpakar practically sold the water. Very little faliz was sown and as the river dried up-below the Head of the Rudbar canal at the end of July- even that small area could not be matured. Water arrived at the end of September and wheat was sown though late. In winter of 1902-03 the river was often , in flood from timely | rains and wheat and barley crops re ceived sufficient water.

The spring crops promised well, but cloudy warm weather in March and April brought cn rust which reduced the yield; much damage was also done by mice. Many ploughs in Afghan Seistan and in the villages around Daudi did not recover the seed sown. The autumn crops were also poor ; the melons suffered from disease and the other crops from deficient supply at maturing time. The year was one of exceptional high wind which began as usual about the 20th May and blew till the end of August, very hot and very strong. The area of Hamlin at the height of the floods did not reach the level of 1903, and rapidly diminished by eva- Tbe Hamun. poration during the hot dry season and high winds. All but the deepest pools in the Hamiin-i-Puzak and most of the isolated Chung in the Naizar dried up /ncj. — A useful fall of rain occurred in the last week of November 1904; the weather then became beautifully clear CHn,ate ' and bright and remained so till nearly the end of January ; as a result the autumn supply was lower than that of the previous autumns with which we had acquaintance. On the 20th January the great blizzard began and brought intense cold, but only a little snow fell, and the rainfall of the winter and spring was slight. A second blizzard also accompanied bv intense cold finished up March and introduced a summer of intense heat; the thermometer in July registered \2l\ in the shade much higher than any tempe rature recorded during the stay of the Mission ; the same intense heat ; as well as the great cold of the winter, was experienced over the Frontier and over most parts of India. The ‘ 120 days ’ wind was probably normal, and so too was the autumn ; but on the 15th December an unusually heavy rain began ; this rain spread over Baluchistan and into Northern India. At the Consulate a rainfall of an inch was recorded and at Diwan Chah (Kuh-i-Malik Siah Ziarat) the torrent rose in flood twice between the 15th and 20th, and carried away the bricks being prepared therein for the house of the Vice-Consul. The rain water collected in the bed of the Sar-i-Shela and made the fords on the trade route slippery and bad. The flood in the river came down about the 20th, breached the band, overflowed* the banks at Kuhak and flooded lands at Khvvaja Ahmad, Jazinak and Dashtak • in these villages the water did damage to both buildings and crops, showing that the band must have been very strong and held so long that a very high flood went down the Rud-i-Seistan , The flood passed away quickly and ploughings were then pushed on vigorously everywhere, and people said that this would be a Sal-i-Nuh.

The first rapid rise was at the beginning of February, but the band was not breached till the 20th of March when a short sharp flood of only 15,216 cusecs came down the river and breached the band ; the supply fell again to 6,760 cusecs on the 13th April. It rose again to 16,329 cusecs on the 25th April, but the maximum volume of the season was from the 4th to 7th May when the gaugings shewed a discharge of 16,853 cusecs ; this is the maximum volume for this season.

V * - at¥ 535 st '» 1 V r 1 ^ ¥ App. 24.] These volumes are a measure of the saving of water due to the decreased evaporation that occurs over the springs in the catchment and along the river on its way to the lake; they also shew how constant the draw of the canals along the river must be;; our notes and observations on the discharges confirm this. Major Macpherson gauged the river on the 24th November and fixed its volume (1,213 cusecs) at this very important stage. The volume in the river at the band on that date was 1,213 cusecs distribut ed as follows :— Persian Seistdn. Rud-i-Seistan ... ... Rud-i-Paridn ... Lakhshak ... ... Deh Dost Muhammad ,,, Afghan Seistan by Charkh ... ... 943* 184 31 13 M7* 43 Add probable volume used by Afghans from Bandar-i*Kamal Khan to Band 1,313 200 1,413 The Persians were therefore using 83 per cent, of the water and the Afghans 17 per cent. The band was breached, as has already been said by the flood on the 20th December, so that the volume then became ample and the people looked fonvard to a prosperous spring harvest. The following valuable information about the crops, Naizar, etc., in this year Autumn crops of .90S. °f exceptional interest has been kindly fur- rushed by Muhammad Ashraf Khan Popal- zai, Vice-Consul at Kuh-i-Malik Siah Ziarat. The larger part of the supply of the river was secured for some favourably situated canals on the Rud-i-Seistdn by the early repairs of the band on the 20th of August. The small balance of the supply was taken by the Jahanabad and Lakhshak canals of the Miankangf, as these were fed from above the Band-i-Parian. But the area of crop matured by the water was very small ; there was a total failure of all crops in Afghan Seistin and except the small area saved on the favoured canals alluded to above a total failure in Persian Seistan. The small supply in August in such a hot year could not be expected to mature more than 20,000 to 30,000 acres. The early sowings of wheat and barley were deficient for want of water, but Spring crop of .906-07 in Persian SeisUn. early and timely flood rectified ’ this. Up to the end of July rates of wheat re mained one Seistani man a kran, but after that an export to Kain began and the rate rose by the end of October to half a Seistani man a kran ; and there was much anxiety among the cultivators to get grain to sow ; it is one of the virtues of the system of cultivation that it is entirely to the interests of Government that the cultivators should have seed ; in consequence, at the end of November, orders came from Meshed to sell the Government grain. The rate fixed for sale to the Consulate was one Seistani man zkran, and to the people 113 kra?i per one kharwar Seistani. Since the Rud-i-SeistAn secured the greater part of the supply early sowing of wheat was done on the more favoured canals around Kimak, Aliabad and Kaud, wTile those about Warmal, Sihkuha, Bunjar, Iskil got water later : in November a silt clearance w r as done by Sardar Purdil Khan in the bed of the Rud-i-Seistan near Jazfnak and Dashtak in the interests of the villages near the Kuh-i-Khwdja, who were the last to get water. At the middle of November there was green wheat nearly ready to cut around Kimak in the Mahal of the53 6 [App. 24, Nahrui and Shahraki, while the water had only just filled the Deh Dost Muham mad canal in the Miankangi, and ploughings were going on in the areas inter mediate between these two extremes. It will be seen that the Shib-i-Ab Mahal did better than the Pusht-i-Ab, althoug;h the draw dowm the Rud-i-Hasanki is great, yet the influence of Sardar Purdil Khan, whose interests lie in the Shib- i-Ab is greater and by his energy in silt clearance the sowings in the villages in his circle near the tail of the Rud-i-Seistan were more advanced than those on the Rud-i-Hasanki, which is the first big branch of the Rud-i Seistan. Until the Afghans made the cunette down the Nad-i-Ali channel, described further on, the canals from the Rud-i-Parian got a useful supply, and water even reached Takht-i-Shah, but when tne cunette was opened sowings were suspended till the flood came. A new canal called Ju-i-Hamidabad after the name of the Persian Commis sioner, was made as a branch of the Ghurghuri for the irrigation of lands near the boundary at Takht-i-Shah; the extension sufficed for twelve ploughs of cultivation, and it was hoped that extensions enough for eight more ploughs could be made. Agha Khan, the Kadkhuda of Deh Ghurghuri, is the Kadkhuda of this extension. Sultan Mir Husain, Arab, has made a new canal from the Nad-i-Ali channel above Burj-i-As for the irrigation of a tract near Deh Pokuk. Further notes on ex tensions of canals 'will be found in Major Macpherson’s note at the end of Appendix 31. The Nad-i-Ali channel was dry for the two months of September and Octo ber, and even at the end of November when Spring crop of ,906-07 in Afghan Se.stin. ^ described the next p aragra ph was made, the water only flowed in the Shela-i-Charkh, the bed of which seems quite 2 feet below that of the Sikhsar. After the departure of the Mission the Akhandzada Fakir Muhammad went to Kabul, and had not come back up to December, but in his absence Sardar Musa Khan cleared out and deepened all the canals, so that just before the flood came they were drawing well. ^ Among other works the cunette already referred to was dug down the Nad-i-AH channel from the main stream to the head of the Shela-i-Charkh. This was done to draw the water away from the Rud-i-Parian, which till then had drawn a good volume. The water thus secured was passed from the Charkh into the Sikhsar and used tor cultivation around Deh Gul Muhammad, but turns w^ere given to supply drinking water for men and animals in the villages towards Kala-i-Kang. I he Sultani canal was of course improved and extended and its favourable situation up the main river enabled about half its area to be sown before the flood came, and this cultivation must have been as well off as that around Kimak on the Rud-i- Seistan. The canals towards Nad-i-Ali and Jharuki were also deepened and connected to the main river above the Band-i-Parian and the cultivation thereon was about as well off as that in the Pusht-i-Ab Mahal. The price of grain at sowing time was one-third of a Seistani man at Chakhansur and half a Seistani man at Rudbar. It is a defect in the Afghdn administration that they charge heavily for grain at all times ; it is an indirect method of getting a large share of the profits of the badar : but it is open to the grave objection that it kills enterprise and makes the extension of cultivation very slow. The Government and the people suffer most from this short-sighted policy, which compares unfavourably in business aptitude with that pursued on the left bank of the river. The description of the crops of the year has been given in considerable detail, because many valuable lessons are Lessons to be learnt from the year. , , r . . r ,1 • to be learnt irom the experience or this year; the first is that of the certain rise of the river after the wind drops—both doubtless due to the same cause ; the shorter and therefore cooler days ; in such a year the valuable autumn crop cultivation is prevented in the tracts along the main stream in the Miankangi and in Tababa-i-Nad-i-Ali by the construction of band to divert the W'ater into the old established villages controlled by the influential men. This must of necessity be so, and it is the only way to get any value out of the small supply that flowed. A large area of valuable wheat was537 App. 24.] sown before the flood came, probably quite as large an area as was sown in the same time in 1903 due entirely to the great skill with which the people distri bute the water when compelled to in tight times. The winter flood too was early a characteristic of such years. The grazing in the Naizar is not affected by such a dry year, as the following note will shew that it was better than the average, as it was easier to get to. The floods of the spring were sufficient to provide a good crop of grazing The Naizar. ^ or ^ cattle who were able to graze in great comfort, because the ground in which the reeds thrive became dry early in the season. 1 he herd-owners in Hecember were veil satisfied with the grazing of the year and the Saiyads looked forward to a good winter of sport. There was enough water in all the large Chung lying between Rah-i-Gardowak and Dahanad-Farah Rud to enable a tutw to be freely used, while the best Chung at the tail of the Rud-i-Paridn also had water in them, so that the growth of weeds that attract the wild fowl was good. The Hamun-i- Puzd.k was dry and also Chung-i-Mesh Kushi, Deh Surkh, Hamun-i-!&lt;uh-i- Khwaja, Naizar-i-Adimi, and of course all the shallower Chung as well as those that are further removed from the inflow of the river at flood. The fish must have suffered much from the poor supply for early in October Mr. Keyes said the smell of dead fish was so great at the tail of the Rud-i-Parian that he was not able to pitch his camp within four miles of Musjid-i-Gurg AH. The Mastansir-ul-Mulk made very heavy assessments at the time of Revenue letting the contracts, and there was some doubt at first whether the contracts made would be realised. This official is said to have severely taxed every source of revenue and himself counted the shops, mills, Saiyads. gardens, etc.; many of the allowances to Mullas and Saiyads have been withdrawn or reduced. His as* sessment has since been received and is given in Appendix 41. \ [cf 39 Fr.l RRAPPENDIX 25. CONTENTS. The Great Flood of if 85.

The marks of this flood have been recovered and the volume that flowed at The volume of the flood. ^ height of the flood has been calculated at many places from Rudbar to Kala-i- Uuwak ; the results shew that a flood of between 600,000 and 700,000 cusecs came down the gorge of the Helmand ; over i, 10,000 cusecs of this passed down the Traka channel; further down the river some water escaped towards Palangi and Paisai, leaving the river near Dam-i-Kal&amp;n; in spite of this escapage 400,000 cusecs, at least, must have passed at the height of the flood to the Northern Hamun past the Band-i-Seistan ; whereas in 19031 which was itself a year of great flood, only 70,000 cusecs reached the Band-i-Seistdn at the height of the flood and no water escaped from the main channel anywhere up the river. The winter* of 1885 was a we ^ known wet year on the frontier. Mr. W. A. Mr. Johns' note on the rains of the spring cf Johns, Consulting Engineer for Railways, ,88s ’ _ who was the Railway Reconnaissance Offi cer on the Mission, writes that he clearly recollected the year; he was building that part of the Hurnai line that is near Baba Kachh ; the floods were frequent, and he was always having his works upset by them. The biggest flood came down between the 1st and 7th of April and established a record in floods on the Nari river. There had been general rain that week all over Baluchistan and Afghanistan. March had been on the whole dry, though there had been floods in January and February. At Sharigh 17 inches of rain was recorded that spring against an average of some three inches. Mr. Johns is confident that the big flood on the Helmand occurred about the 7th of April 1885. The Russo-Afgh£n Boundary Commission passed through Seisffin in the pre vious October travelling from Khwaja Ali Mr. Merk’s visitto Seistan in December 1885. down the river past Nadd-AH and thence through Khwdja Girak round the Puz 4 k H&amp;mun. At the end of December 1885, Mr. Merk brought a party back this way to Chahdrburj£k and there bid good-bye to them. On his return journey he took advantage of the ample supply of water left by the flood in the Riid-i- Trakti to travel down that channel and crossing the Sar-i-Shela at the Gardan Reg ford went round the Hamun to Bahring and thence to Bandan.

The Khan Bahadur’s 8 miles to the inch map of this desert tract is most complete and54 o [App. 25 - valuable. He gave me great help in my enquiries about this flood made in June 1903. The date of the flood, and the general state of the country after the flood, has been very completely fixed by our own men, and all that the Baluchis, who had ‘ experiences ” in that flood, say can be verified from Mr. Merk’s diaries pub lished in one of the volumes of the records of the Intelligence Branch with the Afghanistan Boundary Delimitation Commission.

The flood - , , rose suddenly* on a river that was already in flood, perhaps as great as that of May the first 1903; the low lyina tamarisk covered lands were all quickly submerged and the water rose above the top of the tamarisk.^ The river is said to have reached its highest level a *j mi 1 • 1 , anc ^ rema ^ ne&lt; ^ 50 till the next evening, when it began to sub side and in three days the level had fallen six feet: on the third day another flood came down ; but it did not rise so high as the first flood ; this flood went down about six feet m two days. From the 7th to the 10th day after the flood the stream down the Traku channel was fordable and soon after became dry for seven days it was too deep to be crossed. ,^ e ,reached by the flood waters was about 15 feet higher than that reached by the flood of i 9 o 3 in all places up the valley from Bandar-i-Kamdl Khdn to Rudbar. At Kala-i-Guwak, where the flood began spreading out over the delta the leve of the water was 7 or 8 feet higher than that reached by the flood on the first of May_ 1903. At Rudbar the water rose to the bank of the old Gurshasp canal noticed by Bellew and this Mission, and covered the site where the camps of all the Missions that have been down the valley have pitched. e two forts at Rudbar described by Bellew and by the Mission of 1884, were destroyed and the fort of Sarddr Kamdl Khdn at Bandar was also very much damaged.

At Kala Roden the water reached the canal bank and submerged the crops, but some of the crops were afterwards reaped. At Kamal Khdn’s Fort the river escaped down the Trakii trough, the stream flowing 8 or 9 feet deep and half a mile wide with a yo.ume greater than that which came down the river in the height of the flood of 190 3 , and as already said this stream flowed for about two weeks being unford- drat he 0ne r A ^rj ad4 Fakir M^ammad said, that had it not been have ce n r W ?!i?° h u ea , vil y ,ad L en Wlth silt that it could carry no more, it would have scoured out the bed of the Traku channel and established a permanent th^SenaR^d hT abando ' ed tr ° u g h - At Dak-i-Dila the water passed into the Sena Rud, but near the head of the Sena Rud there is an ancient canal whose banks formed a high and strong bar, and the water did not rise over these banks u owed m the canal and spread over the lower lying parts at the head of this rTil and ev “ tual| y Gained back into the river.

The old village of Deh Saiy&amp;d was destroyed and the people only saved their lives by escaping to a tappa hear by ; here they remained several days till the waters subsided.

The effect of the flood on the Hdmun-i-Sabari has been described on page 505 The H&amp;mtin-i-Sabari. of Appendix 23. The Hamun filled rapid ly and flowed off towards the Sar-i-Shela, which it is, variously, said to have reached in from 4 to 10 daysf after the flood that came direct down the Traku channel. Kundar, Tappa-i-Asak, Tappa-i-Khak atid Fump-i-Mir Dost were, surrounded by water. The flood waters nearly reached Hauzdar, but not Macchi. The water was about three feet deep on the road (Rah-i-Muksir) across the head of the Sar-i-Shela from Tump-i-Mir Dost to the hills. The flood down the Trakp channel was observed by a large number of Baluch The Traku channel. flock-owners, because the extraordinary heavy rains of the winter had filled the water pools and caused the shrubs to sprout at all the nawar (enclosed basins) on the dasht, and many of them had moved out to good places along the Traku trough and were living there preparatory to going to the hills a little later. The flood water is said to have reached Gina and Adah by the next day ; the main body of the water went down the big channel going to Ramriid, and from there past Chah Saif-ud-din Nawar and thence past the Gumbad-i-Liddi, where it fell into the Sar-i-Shela by the big conspicuous old channel which one sees to the east of the trade route. The Baluchis say that no water from the Traku-Rud went north of Girdi Ch£h to the inundated area above the head of the Sar- i-Shela, but all flowed into the Sheia near the Gumbad-i-Liddi. The sand-hills prevented it spreading south. The tract of country around Girdi Chah was under water. Ramrud, Naluki, Nawar Saif-ud-din, Adali, Kachauli and Liddi stood up like inlands they say. As already stated, the waters from the Northern Hdmun zua the Kuh-i- Khwaja are said to have reached the Sar-i-Shela from 4 to 10 days after the flood down the Traku Rud arrived at the Sar-i-Shela. • This is said to be the original beginning of the Rud-i-Paricin, that part north of Jalaldbdd has existed since this time. t These times may or may not be accurate, but the accounts of all eye-witnesses agree very closely. Mr. Merk was told that the Hamun filled in 10 days. [C636FD]542 [App. 25. The Sar-i-Shela ran full level with the surrounding country, the depth of the flowing water was over 30 feet, the width The Sar-i-Sheia. about 1,000 feet and the discharge at the height of the flood about 1,40,000 cusecs, that is, twice the volume of the Helmand at the height of the big flood of 1903. About 15 days after the flood came down Edu, Pahlawan, a celebrated character, still living near Saindak, crossed the Sar-i-Shela at the Gardan Reg ford, a short distance upstream of the newly demarcated boundary ; he had with him ten men and two camels. Five days after Amal, an influential flock-owner, crossed at the same place with twenty men and five camels. Amal says it took them three days to get across; they made a sal or raft of about 20 inflated skins which could take about 5 men across at a time: they swam the camels over, buoyed up in the usual way with inflated skins. By this time the water in the Sar- i-Shela had fallen 2 feet; when Fdu crossed, the flood was still at its highest level. About three weeks later Amal came back again and found that the flood had sub sided to about 6 feet below its highest level. Amal says he came again from the hills three months after the flood to reap the melons he had sown on the Hel mand ; he was just able to ford at the crossing near the Gumbad-i-Liddi which is 5 miles above the Gardan Reg crossing previously referred to. From the Sar-i- Shela to Girdi Chdh a wide expanse of water stood which could not be crossed because of the many deep shela that intersected it. The fords at Sh&amp;h-i-Mardan and Guzar-i-Shamshiri further down the Sar-i-Shela were also fordable. In November he had occasion to cross again, but a strong* wind was blowing and he was delayed on the banks of the Sar-i-Shela three days till the wind stopped and the water became fordable, even so it was up to the bellies of the camels. This state of affairs continued to the end of the next flood season. The people say that this flood enlarged and deepened the Sar-i-Shela at its head, so that since that date the floods flow off from the northern inundated area earlier than they formerly did. The Gaud-i-Zireh filled up to a depth of about 30! to 34 feet, ascertained from : The Gaud.i.Zireh. ‘j 16 ?°° d ™ a 1 rks at , * he . 0ruk spring. The bar-i-Shela has a delta in the Gaud-i-Zireh, and the water flowed through this delta by many channels. It is probable that when the flood first arrived it overpowered all the channels, and flooded the delta, as the Maldars who arrived first seem to have had great difficulty to find suitable places to sow millet and melons. Some say that no sowings could be made at all in 1885. As the water rose in the Gaud-i-Zireh a return flow came along the scarp which makes the north-western boundary of Gaud-i-Zireh to Fakir Ganj Nawar, where there is a big depression in the Dasht or plateau which was filled to a depth of 12 feet. This water seems to flow back along a depression that must exist between the toe of the talus or fan and the foot of this scarp that ends the Dasht-i-Zireh of our maps. This scarp is called by the Baluchis the Dasht-i-Paskunaki. Paskunaki has the same meaning as our word 11 back water ”. All Baluchis agree in say ing that the Paskunaki does not fill till the water has first risen in the Gaud-i- Zireh, so that it seems certdin that the arms of the Sar-i-Shela extend far out into the Gaud-i-Zireh and first deliver the water to some deeper depression from which it returns to bakir Ganj Nawar, which is in itself a deep depression. There are several Shela which leave the Traku trough and cross the fan on .

So that it is most probable that the Gaud-i-Zireh area is divided up into separate smaller depressions by ridges just as the Northern Hamun area is now known to be. From the descriptions the Baluchis give of the circulation of the hood waters in the depression it would seem that the Paskunaki bears the * Mr. Merk crossed on the 2gth December 1885 and noted this f Ot 1,000 cusecs was flowing at the time, no wind blowing.

Rah-i-Shamshiri. An interesting detail given by the flock-owners, who in large numbers took their flocks to the shores of the Gaud- i-Zireh and remained there about three years or more, is that the Rdh-i-Shamshfri, which crosses the Sar-i-Shela by the Guzar-i-Shamshiri, is a high lurga which was not covered even in this very high flood. The flock-owners put their paias on the banks of the Shela-i-Paskunaki. While the Gaud-i-Zireh was full the road to Sh&amp;h-i-Mard&amp;n, and the road to • rt, u • r- k j ru u • c • cu .

Another interesting detail about this flood is the flood mark on the Dasht-i- ^ a , , , 00 Paskunaki. I examined this and found two marks—one about of or o teet lower than the other. The upper mark was eagerly pointed out as that of the flood of 1885 ; it was near the toe of the cliff; the lower mark was a little way down an old beach ; the ravines in which were filled up by the silt of this flood mark, and I thought that this would be the mark of a later flood, but the Baldchis said that the waters of the Gaud-i-Zireh subsided more or less rapidly to the lower mark and then re mained standing at the lower mark for some time, perhaps kept at this level by the good floods of 1886 and perhaps 1887. The matter is of interest and wants further study. Changes made in the bed of the river at Bandar-i-Kamal Khan by the flood of 1883. During the height of the flood about one-sixth of the supply escaped down Scientific reason for the bed of the river tilting I raku channel; the volume in the below Bandar-i-Kamai Khan. river was between &lt; 5 oo,ooo and 700,000 cusecs; of this about 110,000 cusecs escaped down the Traku channel. The escapage continued for two or three weeks before it finally ceased to flow. As has already been said, the flood w r ater was so heavily laden with silt that the old Akhundzada Fakir Muhammad attributes to this circumstance alone the fact that the river did not scour out a new channel for itself down the Traku trough. When this large decrease in volume took place in water so heavily silt laden a large deposit of material w r as to be expected below the outlet. When Lala Thakur Dass was levelling along the river in September 1904, he found a pool 25 feet deep about one mile down stream of the village of Deh Dost Muhammad (Ghulam Haidar). Enquiries among the Baluchis elicited the information that a large deposit of material occurred here in the flood of 18S5, so that a big rapid was formed downstream of the deposit and this pool was the result of this rapid. The Baluchis say that before the flood of 1885 the river hugged the left bank , at Bandar-i-Kamal Khan, The present The Baluchi s explanation of the phenomenon. . , • i i i r- i i r bed was occupied by the green fields or Deh Ghulam Haider, During the flood the river under-cut and brought down a large amount of material from the cliff on the right bank and this, the Baluchis say, caused the obstruction that raised the bed. But it is more probable that the material was deposited, because the velocity was reduced when so large a part of the volume escaped down the Traku channel. The course of the channel before 1885 is shewn on the sketch map of the _ L , .i r 4 Irrigation Party on the 2 inches to a mile The effect on the fed. sca | e . At that time the river flowed under Kala-i-Mir, and the present bed was cultivated by the people of Bandar-i-Kamal Khan. The people say that before 1885 the ford used to be opposite to Sardar Kamal Khan’s Fort, and the direct road across the ford lie between the Fort and f The exact difference of level between these marks on the southern shore of the Gaud-i-Zireh at Kala-i-Siab close to the wells at Gumbad-i-Shah is ^ feet, viz., higher flood mark reduced level ISGj’go, lower flood mark reduced level i,56o’9o.544 [App. 25. the village of Sardar Ghulam Haidar; there is a ramp at this place ; the ford is now about a mile further up the river at the village. It is probable that Sardar Kamal Khan and Sardar Ghulam Haidar built their villages on the ford : it is usual to find villages on either bank of a good ford. The people say that the deposit below Bandar-i-Kamal Khan is now gradually being lowered and each year the fords at the Gumbad-i-Nadir are less serviceable. In September 1904 the ford at Karodi was even better than that at Bandar-i-Kamal Khan, but this was no doubt due to a chance spreading out of shingle at that rapid. The Baluchis gave many illustrations to shew that the bed of the river , , here had been raised by the flood of 1885. The improvement command ,n the canals. They ^ ^ ^ command of the Kala . i . Path canal on the right bank and the Kala-i-Kuhna canal on the left bank, which take out some distance above Bandar-bKam&amp;l Khan, have improved. The depth of excavation in the former canal has been decreased by two sar (10 or 12 feet) they say. They also say that the shingle bar at Puza-i-Mashi, where the head of the Chaharburjak canal is situated, has been raised and that the Band-i-Puza Mashi has net been built since 1885, except in 1902 when the river dried up and then it was built only to catch all the water coming down the river. Here too they say the canal bed has been raised two or three sat. Want of time did not permit us to investigate the height the bed has been raised. The great flood of 1885 in the Fardh Rud. The Rud-i-Farah has already been described in Appendix 33 ; this river also came down in great and extraordinary flood, so much so that the big em bankment across the mouth of the old trough known as the Banduki-i-Juwain was carried away and a volume of water, some say even greater than that which went down the river, passed into the Piizak Hamun, which, it is said, was converted by the enormous quantity of silt brought down from the deepest depression of all the Hamiins to one of ordinary depth. The river also overflowed on its right bank down the trough known as the Khush Rud or Rud-i-Kharika. Wazirat south of Kala-i-Kah was destroyed they say. The graziers, who were living near Tappa-i-lVfachatak (Musjidak), say that they escaped to the higher lands near Salian, and that there was four feet of water on the road that we used between Tappa-i-Machatak and our camp at Dahan-i-Farah Rud. The flood marks have been traced and mapped. The sheet of water covered all the grazing and the water was too deep for tictin to work. The cattle* were removed to Juwain where they fed on a luxuriant growth of kirta grass until the water subsided and uncovered the slopes, so that the bunnun grass shot up in great luxuriance. The cattle fed on bunnun and tuzg y and the people on water melons which were grown in so great abundance that they were left to rot on the land. This food supply was a great boon, because the flood destroyed so much of the crops that the price of wheat rose from four man Seistani a kran to 40 or 30 sir Seistani a kran. This high rate continued till the next harvest, but even then the rate was 3 man Seistani a kran. With the flood water, corpses of men and animals as well as the palas of huts of the people came down the river. A large boat that would hold 50 men be longing to Sardar Muhammad Yusuf Khdn of Farah was carried down the river and never found again. We took sections of the river as far up the channel as we went, i.e., to opposite Estimated flood voiomo. Peshawarin and from these sections and the flood marks made an estimate of the maximum flood volume that came down the river in 1885 ; it was from 65,000 to 70,000 cusecs, just about double that which is estimated to have passed down in l 9 ° 3 \ Eyewitnesses say a volume equal to this went down the Rud-i-Banduki-i- Juwain and a volume equal to that which normally flows in the Rud-i-Seistan (say 1,700 cusecs) passed down the Khush Rud (Rud-i-Kharika). So that we may estimate the maximum volume of this river in the great flood of 1885 above Lash Juwain at from 125,000 to 150,000 cusecs, or about one-fourth or one-fifth a l K C '' S t ] iat Governor at Lash Juwain charged one kran per head for this grazing from the well-to-do, and half a kran from the poorer cattle-owners.545 VM) &lt;4 4 i i i i * &gt; App. 2S-] of that which came down the Helmand. In 1903 a much smaller volume of water spilled down the Rud-i-Banduki-i-Juwain, and it is probable that the maximum flood of 1885 was 4 or 5 times that of 1903. The great flood in the Harud Rud in 1885. It is said by intelligent men, who were then living at Kala-i-Kah, that the sowing of wheat in 1884-85 was done from water from karez and the water from the river came very late, and much of the wheat suffered for want of water. The river rose in moderate flood before Nauruz, but no damage had been done. The big flood after Nauruz came very suddenly and carried away all the standing wheat and destroyed about 60 villages, around Kala-i-Kah, and damaged all the karez. Half the village of Islamabad was swept away, and for one month no one knew who had escaped ; the people had scattered to high places for refuge. After about one month the fords began to appear and the people collected ; after two and a half months there was about four feet of water at the Kabrak Ford. From the Harud Rud Delta to the Sufaid Kim was one sheet of water. A new Shela is said to have formed leaving the river above Kala-i-Kah and forming two other Shelas, Gazindan and Mathokh, rejoined the river below Kala- i-Kah. / Flood discharges in 1885. The sections that we took for estimating the flood discharges were situated below the off lake of some important shela^ which we afterwards learnt had flowed in the year 1885 and, therefore, the maximum discharge of the great flood can only be conjectured. To guide us in our estimate, some Baluchis were sent to measure the section of the river above the Kuhna Rud-i-Harud {vide Appendix 35); from these sections a calculation of the flood volume of 1885 gives 35,550 cusecs, against 14,234 cusecs for 1903, and 1,874 cusecs for 1904. In the Helmand River, we know that the maximum flood volume of 1885 was quite 6 to 8 times that of 1903, and from the accounts of eye-witnesses the flood on the Harud Rud was just as extraordinary. However, we may guess the maximum flood volume of the Harud Rud to have been on that occasion about 50,000 cusecs, or about n, or ^ of the volume of flood that came down the Helmand on the same occasion. The great flood in the Rud-i-Bandan is described in Appendix 34 on that river, and need not be repeated here. Unfortunately it did not occur to me to take a section of this stream, but this omission can easily be rectified by any one who reads this, and who is resident in Seistan. The hills are close by, so the floods are sudden and great. The great flood of 1885 in the Rud-i-Khash. We do not know much of this river ; in Appendix 32 all the information collected is given. It is said that the old beds down some ancient troughs flowed, but we do not know with what volume. To arrive at some figures to guide us in our conjectures as to what the flood volume was in 1885, some Baluchis were sent to measure the volume of Estimated volumes. the river flowing at the time and to measure a flood section. With this data we estimate that about 13,000 cusecs passed Aleli in the great flood of 1885, or about double the volume that passed down in 1903, and four times that in 1904. It is noticeable that the flood volume of 1885 in the Fardh Rud should have been about four or five times that of 1903, whilst that in the Harud Rud is only about three times and that in the Khash only double the maximum volume of 1903, whilst that in the Helmand River was 8 or 10 times. But it must be remembered that on the Helmand River all the measure ments were made by ourselves, whilst on the Farah Rud, though we made the measurements, we did not go far enough up the river to measure the spill down the Banduki-i-Juwain, and the volume of this is so large as to upset the figures if the Baluchi estimate of its volume is wrong ; the Harud and the Khash were measured only by the Baluchis.

Our information about the river after that is only at long intervals and meagre, till we conae to the sixties. In this period the advent of the Persian Government in Seistan and Major St. Johns’ observations give us most of the material facts we need to know. About the year 1865 a big flood came down that must have nearly, if not quite filled, the Gaud-i-Zireh, not of course to the same depth as the great flood of 1885 after wards did. It is from this year our record really begins. The years of drought and famine which extended all over the world began then, so that water did not again reach the Gaud-i-Zireh till 1877; the Sar-i- Shela flowed and probably a large area of the Gaud-i-Zireh was covered with water. Sir Charles MacGregor and Captain Lockwood visited this desolate region in the February before the flood came down. The depression was dry. In 1878 the Sar-i-Shela is said to have flowed a little. In 1880 the Sar-i-Shela flowed and more water probably reached the de pression. In 1882 the Gaud-i-Zireh is reported to have become dry again. In 1885 the great flood came which filled the Gaud-i-Zireh and established a record. In 1886 water still overflowed to the Gaud-i-Zireh. In 1887 the Sar-i-Shela occasionally flowed, but it is said that no water reached the depression. In 1888 water may or may not have flowed in the Sar-i-Shela ; probably none reached the depression. In 1891 and 1892 water only entered the Sar-i-Shela. In 1894 Colonel Yate and Major Massy visited the Gaud-i-Zireh and a large lake still existed. In 1896 Colonel McMahon visited the Gaud-i-Zireh in April and the area of water, he saw in the depression, is that shewn on the map then prepared. The flood that made the present Rud-i-Pari£n came down the river that spring and water probably reached the Gaud-i-Zireh, because the year 1895 was also one of big flood and the Hamun was filled by it. In 1898 Khan Bahddur Maula Bakhsh records that the floods only reached the head of the Sar-i-Shela. The dry years then set in and culminated in a world-wide drought. In 1903 this great drought ended in a year of abnormal rainfall which caused so big a flood that the Hamun overflowed down the Sar-i- Shela, but the water was only sufficient to fill pools in its bed; none accumulated in the depression. When we became acquainted with the Gaud-i-Zireh early in 1903 it was dry ; no certain information has been obtained of the exact year that this happen ed, but there was water enough in the depression when Colonel McMahon saw it to last two years and perhaps four, and the probability is that the Gaud-i-Zireh eventually dried up about the year 1898 or 1900. “We have reason to believe that the rate of evaporation of the water of this Hamun is only about five feet a year, while that on the Hamun-i-Sabari may be seven, and on the Kuh-i-Khwaja Hamun ten feet a year.

GAUD-I-ZIREH. Cultivation, Grazing, Salt, Roads, and Sweet Water. Notes collected by Lala Thakur Dass from Baluchi flock-owners. N.B.—The personal knowledge of the Irrigation Party is confined to a survey made down the Sar-i-Shela to its end and to a visit to the Oruk Spring from Kala-i-Madar-i-Padshdh. Shora-Gaz and Lees Gaz. In 1877 some water reached the Gaud-i-Zireh after the spring floods, and ^ . , . . — , . 00 filled up its deep portion down to Ziarat-i- rir Kisn. 1 he nock-owners went to the Gaud-i-Zireh in small numbers, as the water soon became brackish. But three years after Sdl-i-Barf (1877) tamarisk grew to its full height on the areas from which the water had receded. This kind of tamarisk the Baluchis call shora-gaz in contradistinction to the tamarisk which grows on the banks of the river and is subject to annual inundations. This latter is called Lees Gaz. The one variety is called shora gaz ) because it is weak and brittle ; and its branches big or small can be broken by the hand without any very great effort, while lees gaz is strong and hard and cannot be so easily broken. Un fortunately no sample of the shora gaz was collected, but the Consul at Seistan would get samples if asked. The shora gaz of the Gaud-i-Zireh yields in very large quantities a kind of sugar, called tirmi. The M&amp;lddrs who r,V»i or the sugar jielded b, tamansk. gone c0 , Iected a good dea , o{ . and a large number of men from Bandar-i-Kam&amp;l Khdn and Rudbar also went to the Gaud-i-Zireh for this very purpose. Three years after the flood of 1877, i.e., in 1880, the shora gaz began to yield tirmi. People cut off the branches of the tamarisk growing in the bed of the Gaud-i-Zireh, and dried them, when the branches of tamarisk were com pletely dry ; they beat them into small pieces and continued beating till the tirmi was separated; it is a very hard substance that grows on the tamarisk branches in round lumps equal in size to a walnut or even smaller. When beaten with mallets along with the branches, it does not become powder; but is broken into pieces, the size of peas. One strong man could collect daily 8 man kru or 4 man Seistdni (48 lbs.) of tirmi. The price of one man Seistdni Price of tirmi. tirmi in those days was three to four kran. This was, therefore, a very good and paying job. Sarddr Muhammad Umar Khan, son of Sardar Kamdl Khan, Sanjardni, of Bandar-i-Kamal Kh£n, took one-fourth of all the tirmi collected by the men ; and he filled a small gambad* with all that fell to his share. In the great flood of 1885 the Gaud-i-Zireh was filled to a level never _ f .QQ- remembered before or since. The water that poured into the Gaud-i-Zireh in 1885 and 1886 did not completely dry till about 1898 ; and therefore a large number of sheep-owners settled themselves here. These men only left the Gaud-i-Zireh in . .. r the spring season when they took their flocks to the hills. 1 he nockowners re mained on the Gaud-i-Zireh till 1902; till then there was plenty of khar (camel-thorn) and other grazing for the sheep and goats ; the remnant of the growth after the flood of 1885. Each year the rains, even though slight, washed the shrubs; and the sheep and goats ate it well. In 1902 there were no rains and the vegetation, too, ceased to grow. The reeds too completely dried up and had died in most places by the year 1902. # A domed room that might contain from 500 to 1,000 cubic feet.

This time Sarddr Muhammad Umar Khdn did not take a share of what was collected. After the flood of 1877, people did not go to the Gaud-i-Zireh in very large Melons and millet grown on the bed of the Gaud- numbers. The water soon became un* i-Ziceh. drinkable ; and only those men went there who found it paying to collect But after the flood of 1885, as soon as the water began to recede, people sowed extensive crops of melons and millet on the slope* or the shore left dry by the water. Every year till 1S92 the Baluchis sowed melons; and they say that the soil in the bed of the Gaud-i- Zireh is so fertile and suitable that the melons grown were larger in size and better in flavour than those grown in Seistdn. The yield too from the seed was much higher than in Seist&amp;n. There is no salt tax in Seistdn. Every man can take into Seist£n as much Salt in the Gaud-i-Zireh and Sar-i-Shela. f a ^ 33 ^ ls found in very large quantities at the following places in the Gaud-i-Zireh : — (1) Near Gambad-i-Liddi, at the junction of old Shela-i-Traku with the Sar-i- Shela, there is a kurg ox pit in the bed about 100 feet long by 50 feet broad. The thickness of the salt layer is about ij feet. This salt is very pure ; people carry it into Seistdn, as this place is the nearest, and water can be got from the sweet wells at Chdh-i-Saif- ud-Din Nawar, Girdi Chdh, etc., which are not far off. The build ing parties on the boundary pillars passed this way and collected much excellent salt. My syces collected enough for my horses for 6 months. These pools were replenished in 1903, and while the Sar-i-Shela was flowing^ were sweet. But when the flow stopt the water became undrinkable within a week ; up to May 1905 the water had suffered much less diminution than would have been expected. The pools are in a channel 30 feet deep and are them selves very deep. Evaporation too is, perhaps, not so great as in the Hamun. (2) In Nawar-i-Fakir, there is about 9 inches of salt. This is not such good salt, as it is mixed with a little earth. (3) In the bed of the Sar-i-Shela where Bah-i-Kirtaka'f' crosses it, the depth of the salt is about 1-25 feet. The salt is pure and quite free from foreign matter and pure white. Under the salt is hard soil. (4) At the place, where Rah-i-Kachau from Bandar-i-Kamal Khan Jeaves the high Dasht, there is a large area under salt. This salt is not good, as the washings from the Dasht bring earth which mixes with the salt. (5) The deep parts of the Gaud-i-Zireh are all covered with salt. No one goes there, as salt can be obtained readily from other places more easily to get to. On the line of levels from the Oruk sprino- to the central deep part of the Gaud-i-Zireh a wide belt of salt was crossed. I he depth of this salt was 1 to ij feet. The salt, however was not very good, as it contained some earth. (6) Large numbers of kafila are said to come from Afghanistan to Sultan Pir Kisri in the cold weather. The salt at this place is good. The water of the Robat Nalla at this place is said not to be drinkable and the kafila take water with them from the Helmand River. Captain Webb-Ware crossed from Rudbar in February 1903 and his diaries will give personal observations on this point. * I think this cultivation must have been confined to the alluvial fan of the Sar i ah .u melons bed and millet stalks I saw were on this fan. ° the All the old t This is the ford where the road from Bandar-i-KamiH Khan to Kirtaka crosses the .u wells, also called Gumbad-i-Chah, because the S tombs mentioned by General MacGregor are nJaX In moTwe saw ao s ,g„, of salt here.

We know little or nothing about these wells ; the names indicate that the Gaud-i-Zireh is visited after the water becomes brackish and in fact till the grazing dries up. The water at the following wells has always been sweet both before* and after the great flood of 1885. The wells marked with an asterisk have been visited by members of the Mission; the others have been described by Baluchis; the situation and value of the latter is very uncertain— *Girdi Chah. *Chah Saif-ud-din Nawar or Nawar Chah.

Oruk is 8 miles south of Kala-i-Madar-i-Padshah on the northern edge of the Gaud-i-Zireh basin. ^ Oruk spring is called Oruk Pitok by the Baluchi. Details are given on the sketch map made by Lala Thakur Dass. The water trickles out from the side of a high vertical cliff of alluvial and is collected in small pot holes ; in September 1904 only 17 gallons were got during the night; this is the autumn supply ; in winter the supply would be more and in summer less. The w r ater is sweet, but some care is required to prevent it from becoming brackish by contamination from the salt incrustations on the cliff. Chah-i-Oruk is near the above spring and is a well about 30 feet diameter and 20 feet deep; the water is brackish but drinkable. It is said that the well has lately been enlarged. Some Baluchis from the Sarhad started work to make a karez here in 1902 or 1903, but Sardar Atta Muhammad Khan of Chaharburjak turned them out and sent his own men, who have enlarged the well, but have not succeeded in bringing the water out to the surface of the ground that they wish to cultivate, although a water-course, some 600 feet long, has been dug. It was said that Sardar Atta Muhammad Khan intended to push on the work and do some cultivation. The cultivation would be done on the wash down of the cliff which is sweet ; the salt lands begin about 5 miles from the Chah-i-Oruk. t This important water has no definite name, though the five gumbad (tombs) near by clearly mark its situation ; the Baluchis with Sir Charles MacGregor (1877) called it Gumbad-i-Shdh Maksud ; those with Colonel Yate (1894) Gumbad-i-Sar-i-Zireh- those with Colonel McMahon Gumbad-i-Shah and Kila-i-Maksud. It is known as Chlh-i-Sar-i-Shela, Rdh*i-Kachau and Gazgan (a place of tamarisk). Though the latter is perhaps a couple of miles higher up the Sar-i-Shela.

C639FD YYAPPENDIX 28. Detailed description of the roads across the inundated area. There are many roads across the inundated area, and a detailed description of each, as they were in 1903-1905, will be of interest. The details will shew that not only do the roads vary a great deal according to the state of the floods, but they also vary according to the position of the main stream for the time being. The information therefore cannot be used without reflection, but an intelligent study of it will help those who may have to discover the best road at some future time when the Naiz£r is in a quite different position. The roads that will be described are— (1) The road by Khwdja Girak. (2) The road by Takht-i-Shah and Tappa-i-Kharan or Rdh-i-Mesh Kushi. (3) Rah-i-Shela-i-Dehno. (4) Rdh i-Chashmaka or Bak-i*Sabibdad. (5) Rdh-i-Sargaz-i-Jam^l. (6) Rah-i-Nai Rez, Pusht-i-Adimi, or Rdh-i*Teshakani. (7) Rdhi-i-Chung-i-Daraz. (8) Rdh*i-Kundil Khdni. (9) R&amp;h-i-Chargan or Rah-i-Tiratki. (10) Rah-i-Surkh Gazi. (it) R^h-i-Gardowak, or Rdh-i-Paran-i*Soofi or Rah-i Kucha, the road along the telegraph line. (12) Rah-i-Kuh-i-Khwaja, • Roads across the inundated area lying between the month of the Khash Hud and the Hdmun-i-Puzdk. 1. The road via Khwdja Robat and Kkwdja Girak. —When the Helmand River delivered the greater part of its volume into the Naizar to the east of Takht-i-Shah there was more difficulty in passing from the direction of Nad-i- Ali to the roads on the desert on the north-eastern shore of the inundated tract than there is now. The Afghan Boundary Commission passed this way round the inundated, area and Colonel Maitland records that “the road we came along the edge of the Naizar is never absolutely closed by water, but about Khwaja* Girak people have to wade across the shallow arms of the Naizdr when it is filled after the flood season. The whole area covered with reeds is usually under water from about the beginning or middle of March to the middle of May. The water then goes slowly down for two months and by the end of July is about the same height as we saw it.” This was wTitten in the autumn of 1884 just before the great flood of 1885. Much the same road was followed by General Beresford Lovett, R.E. (then Captain), in March 1872. In 1903 the floods spread out far to the east of the route from Nad-i-Ali to Khwaja Girak, and these roads w'ere for a short time closed. But in February 1904 the Mission were able to go to the Puzak Hamun past Tappa-i-Talai almost straight across the Naizar to Ziarat-i-Hadira. Water only remained in chung (pools). * A narrow Lurga (ridge) connects Khwaja Robat and Khwaja Girak and water seld, m rises more than 2-0 feet on this. Deeper water is said to be met at Dahana Gaskari between Khwaja Girak and Shacd (the gravel beach or shore of the Hamua).558 [App. 28. The road from Kala-i-Kang through Khwdja Robat, Khwdja Gfrak and so along the eastern shore of the Puz&amp;k Hdmun is a well known one, but of course is not as much used by Seistdnis as the one by Takht-i-Shah. The information collected by Colonel Maitland is correct and up to date. The state of this road depends also on the floods of the Kdsh and the direction which they take, but it is not probable that the road would now ever be closed for long, seeing that the main stream of the Helmand enters the Naiz4r so much further to the west than it did in 1S84. The important roads to Kandahar and Kabul up the Khdsh seems never to be interrupted by floods as the inundated area can be rounded to the south if necessary. Road across the Naizar between the Hdmun-i-Puzak and the Kuh-i-Rhwdja. 2. The road from Takht-i-Shah past Tappa-i-Kharan, often called the Rah-i-Mesh Kushi, because the only difficult portion of the road is the crossing of the Shela-i-Mesh Kushi when it is in flood. This Shela connects the Hdmun-^Puzdk with the series of chung at the tail of the Rud-i- Panam It is a narrow shallow and slowly moving volume of water which early in the flood season flows to the Hdmun-i-Puzak, and when that is’ full the overflow comes back again by the same Shela. In the big flood of 1903 the width of deep water on the Shela was about two miles ; it was not fordable for loaded animals for about 15 days (3rd* to 18th May) only ; but tutm could not be obtained because the Saiydds had not been ab e to secure any tut \ none had been stored in the previous summer and the new growth had not had time to come on. But in normal years the Saiy^ds maintain tutm here when the volume of water makes them necessary. In 1904 the depth of water on the Shela became 4 feet for a short time when the wind blew strong; at all other times it was fordable. Tutm were provided for those who preferred not to wade and wished to cross in comfort. Since the main volume of the river has discharged itself by the Paridn mouth this has been the only road for loaded the^hela'i Mp ^ T he road £ oes from T akht-i-Shah and the Shela-i-Mesh Kushi is crossed about five miles north of that place The road then runs to the north-east of Tappa-i-Kharan (or Karun) and ’thence ^^(HokTt) PesMw ^ ran t0 Lash J uwain and various villages in Aukat-i. w r ° ad f0ll riu a ci d f {Iur / a \ of the He ^nd ^an from Takhtd-Shah the Delta^Th^F at th ® draina § e between the two fans, then ascends the Delta 01 the Fardh Rud on a ridge of that fan.

Now that the waters of the river flood the lands up to Tappa-i-Adira people use this road only when the Naizar between Adira and Shela-i-Dehno is dry, it is a shorter cut to Lash Juwain than the road via Takht-i-Shah. In the winter of 1904, the Naizar from Adira to Tappa-i-Jumalika vid Shela-i-Dehno was dry and people went by this road, but in January 1905 the water began to rise over the road and then only single men with no baggage were seen to use it. Near Shela-i-Dehno this road bifurcates. One road goes to Tappa-i* , , , , Bahring and then to Kula-i-Khan,* 3 miles tufujcation of the road. , . 0 , f 1..1 /n/r to the south of iappa-i-Machatak (Musji- dak) on the north shore of the Naizar. This road is now generally under water ; only Gaodars or occasional travellers well acquainted with the Naizar use it. It was often used in January 1905 by members of the Mission. The other road goes to Tappa-i-Jumalika vid Chung-i-Bahringak and Barfi. This road too is not much frequented now, because few people come by this road ; when the Naizdr is flooded they either go by Takht-i-Shah and take a road along the Naizar of Chung-i-Bahringak ; or if they have no baggage to carry make direct for Tappa-i-Jumalika from Deh Kurki or Deh Shaikh Waisi. In January 1905 the Mission camp marched from Dahan-i-Farah Rud to Deh Shaikh Waisi by this road. In the year 1904 both these roads were almost dry for a short time about the end of November. The road from d appa-i-Bahringak to Khel-i-Kula-i- Khdn was under water by the middle of December i 9 ° 4 &gt; but the road from Deh Kurki and As-i-Haji Karim to Tappa-i-Jumahka remained dry till the end of January 1905. When the Seistdn Mission was in camp at Dahan-i-Rud-i-Fardh, the road from Kula-i-Khan to Tappa-i-Adira vid Making the road m 1904. Tappa-i-Bahring, Shela-i-Dehno was put into good order. Wherever water had covered the road, reed and tut were spread (such work is called Natures). Shela-i-Dehno too was filled with tamarisk j this sort of bridge for crossing a channel is called in c^eistan Gazgcin. The road on the 20th December 1904 was fit for horses and mules, cattle and men. But the water in the Naizar rose rapidly at the end of the year and the road soon became useless. The cattle-owners are able to control the shela by closing them with embankments, and thus confine the flow of water to the main shela during low river. The water is not allowed to spread through the reed beds until the river rises’in flood and breaches the embankments ; before this happens the cattle- owners clear out with their camps, and burn the reeds so as to get gieen shoots in the spring. 4. Rdh-«-Chashmdkd or Buk-i-Sahibddd.—\s so called because the road passes over Lurg-i-Chashmaka, and across the Gazg or channel called Buk-i- F Sahibdad after the fishing nets of some Bub net, Ca*5 , = Channel wide and shallow. named Sahibdad. This is the straight road from Nasratabad to Aukat-i-Seistan. It passes through Deh Rahdar, Ziarat-i-Khwaja Musa, Khel-i-Chashmaka, Lurg-i-Gaz-i-Julla, Lurg-i- Gamshad Kula-i-Khan and thence to Dahan-i-Farah Rud, or else straight up the Farah Rud vid Peshawaran. When the Naizar is dry or the water is very low the reeds in the Naizar become thin and people going to Aukat-i-Seistan use this road. When the Hamlin is high and the road is under water people seldom go by this road. This is the road that Generals Goldsmid and Pollock used on the 13th March 1872. At that time the Naizar General Goldsmid’s Mission in 1872. was dr y owing tO the great drought that had just ended, but the party passed through about 5 miles of thick reeds and bulrushes {vide “ Eastern Persia,” page 314). On the 16th March 1904, Lala Thakur Dass, Supervisor, and Babu Gopal Singh, Sub-overseer, with 12 Seistanis and The road m March 1904. ^ Khalasis crossed the Naizar from Kula- i-Khan to Chashmakd.

The start was made at 10 A.M. from Khel-i- Kulcl-i-Khan and Khel-i-Chashmaka was reached at 8 P.M. In December 1904 some repairs were done to this road by the Mission from Kuld-i-Khan to Khel-i-Ali; but the water ecem er 1904. then began to rise and the road was diverted to Tappa-i-Bahring as already described on the previous page. From Deh R&amp;hdar to Ziarat Khw£ja Musa, the road was quite dry up to the 17th January 1905. Some water flowed in Shela-i-Ziarat Khwaja Musa and from Chashmaka to Kula-i-Khan the Naizar was all under water. From Chashmaka there is a road for tutin vid Chung-i-Shahbeg and &lt;7»/.&gt; . ... c . ., Chung-i-Zainal across the aukan to the Tutut road vid Chung i-Shahbeg. T • t-. rr i i i . Lurg-i- 13 uz Kushta and thence to Dahan- i-Fardh Rud and Aukdt'i-Seistdn (Hokat), but only Gaodars use it. 5. Rdh-i-Sargaz-i-Jamdl. —This also is only a tutin road, but much used by the Saiy&amp;ds and Gdoddrs. About too tutin called tutin-i-saiyad or tutin-u shikar axz kept at Khel-i-Sargaz-i-JamAl to the east of Kala-i-Nau, but no big tutin for carrying loads. This road or rather way runs from K hel-i-Sargaz-i-JamAl to Lurg-i-Buz Kushta through Chung-i-Arabi, Talaki, Garkando, Zainal, Aukan and so to Lurg-i-Buz Kushta. Men who go by this road have to pass the night on the Lurga by the Aukan; and therefore travellers other than Saiydds or Giodirs seldom use it. 6. Rdh-i-Nai Rez Pusht-i-Adimi also called Rdh-i-Teshakani .—This road or way is called Rdh-uNai Rez, because it can only be used if the G£oddrs put reeds, etc., on the Gazg or shallow channel which the road crosses before it reaches the higher level on Lurg-i-Teshakani. The derivation of Teshakani is given in Appendix 22, page 495. The road starts from Adimi at Khel-i*Sai)ad, crosses Gazg-i-Adimi, passes by Paran-i-Chheda on Lurg-i-Teshakani and AutAk-i-Kaldn to the four Aukan which must be crossed on a tutin to Lurg-i-Buz Kushta From Lurg-i-Buz Kushta to Dahan-i-Fanih Rud, the road runs on a high sandy ridge in the dry. From the Aukan to Lurg-i-Buz Kushta, the tutin are worked in a rung or small deep rut and the horses of the riders follow the tutin. This is the shortest road from the city of Nasrat£b4d to Dah4n-i-Far£h Rud, and, unless the H£mun is so full as to cover the Lurg-i-Teshakani and Aut4k- i-Kakin, is available every year after the four months of hot wind, when the waters of the Naizdr and H&amp;mun are usually low. The road becomes fit for the passage of men and animals in autumn The road in ,904. {tirmah) about November. In 1904, the Saiyads made the Nai-rez at the end of November, the part of the Naiz&amp;r from Adimi to the Sabari Hdmun, except the Gazg-i-Adimi, had then become dry. This Gazg is about one mile wide, and the greatest depth of water on the 24th January 1905 was 1*3 feet ; loaded camels crossed it easily. The road was only about 3*0' wide, but the people had cut the reed on either side and loaded camels passed without any obstruction. The camp of the Irrigation Surveyors was pitched on Lurg-i-Teshakani The road in the great blizzard Of 1905. Order to run aline of levels to the Auk- ans - Here they were overtaken by the great wind which lasted for 3 days from the 21st to the 23rd January 1905, and which was accompanied by so great cold that the waters all froze and bore, ^he waters from the LUmun-i-Sabari driven by the wind rose and filled up the shallow channels across Lurg-i-AutAk-i-Kaldn, so that the camels could not be marched as f.ir as \A\&amp; Aukan. brom \\\q Aukan to Lurg-i-Buz Kushta camels can never go as the water is too cold in winter for them to swim, and in spring of course the road is usually under water and not feasible. Hence in' 5 ordinary years when Lurg-i-Teshakani is dry, loaded camels can go from Adimi to the Aukan but not further along this road. . r ^^ ie roa ^ remains open for men and animals so long as the water in the Naizar remains low.

A way across the Hamtin-i-S&amp;bari to the south of the boundary line may be noticed here ; it was used by the Persian Commissioner on the 24th of Decern* her 1904 t° save himself the march round the north of the Hamun. Saiyads and uaodars all know this way across the Tangi ox narrow of the Hamiin, and use it when there is no danger from currents set up by high wind or by floods in the Farah Rud. They start from some place on the beach on the lee shore ot this sheet of water, such as Lurg-i-Buz Kushta or Autak-i-Kalan and land at Khankar, a tract of good grazing on the deltas of the torrents that come from the Bandan hills and enter the Hamun near Ziarat-i-Khwaja Saban ; there are extensive reed beds on either shore which shew that the water is shallow, due probably to the material brought by the torrents on the west side and the silt deposited by the wind driven waters of the Hamiin on the east side, 7. Rah-i-Chung-i-Dardz. — So called because the road crosses Chung-i- Dardz. When the Hamun falls low and Lurg-i-Tiratki and Dak-i-Gaz Al-i-Gurg are out of water, people going from Adimi to Mil-i-Nadir sometimes use this road. A large number of tutin are kept at Adimi. The tut in are big as well as small. \\ hen Dak-i-Gaz Al-i-Gurg is out of water the width of the Naizar on this road that must be crossed on a tutin is only about 4 miles. Horses easily follow the tutm. Amir 'Ali Akbar Khan, Governor ofSeistan, crossed the Naizar by Rah-i- Amir ’A]i Akbar Ktmn osed this read. Churg-i-Daraz in March I9O4. HistWO- wheeled carriage was also carried over cn a large tutin. Lala Thakur Pass, Supervisor, and Babu Gopal Singh also crossed here at the end (31st) of March 1904. The tutin took two hours to cross. From Dak-i-Gaz Al-i-Gurz to Mil-i-Nadir the road is drv. As soon as the Sabari Hdmun rises and the shallow channels across Lurg-i-Dak-i Gaz and Lurg-i-Tiratki are filled the road is no longer used. The Saiyads bring over limestone on tutin from the cliffs on the western shore of the Hamun near Bahrfng by this road. A large number of tutin were employed to get limestone for the works at the British Consulate and Imperial Bank. 8. Rdh-i-Kundil Khdni. —This road is not used now a days ; it was opened by Sardar Kundii Khan, Sarbandi, for himself. It starts from the Khel opposite Deh Isa, and crossing Chung-i-Dardz, leads on to Lurg-i-Tiratki. From the Lurg- i-Tiratki the road goes to Bahring. As this road is not now used no are kept here. 9. Rdh 4 -Chargan or Rdk-i-Tiratki. —When the road along the Telegraph Line, called Rah-i-Gardowak, is under water and camels and men cannot pass by it, tutin are placed on the Rah-i*Tiratki to meet the wants of the traffic. A larger number of big and small tutin are kept on this road ; and people with their luggage and horses, as well as their camels, go by the road. Men and luggage cross on tutin. The animals follow the tutin walking, and occasionally, though seldom, swimming. Rah-i-Tiratki is thus used until Rah-i-Gardowak becomes dry enough for camels and men to use it. But if the Hamun rises verv high, and Lurg-i-Tiratki on to which Rah-i* Tiratki leads is under water, or is liable to be flooded by the waves of the Sabari Hamun, the tutin are taken from Rah-i-Tiratki \.o Rah-i-Surkh Gazi. This is another and shallower road for tutin, a little to the south-west of Rah-i-Tiratki. When the level of the water in the Hamun falls and Lurg-i-Tiratki is again dry tutin are again brought to Rah-i-Tiratki, as the distance is shorter than Rah-i-Surkh Gazi. Babu Hari Singh, Irrigation Surveyor, crossed over on tutin at Rah-i-Tiratki in December 1903 ; and Lala Thakur Dass and Babu Gopal • Lala Thakur Das*. Supervisor also came this Singh On I St April I 904. At both these way 00 the 31st January 1905. times the tutin worked at Rah-i-TiratKi. On the 31st January 19C5, Rah-i-Tiratki or R£h-i-Chargan was quite dry. The rung or ihc small channel for working the tutin contained only foul water ; theNaiz&amp;r was dry, and men with loaded camels came from the western shore of the Sdbari Hamiin to Afzalabad by this road without meeting any water. R£h- i-Surkh Gazi and Rdh-i*Gardowak were, of course, quite dry. The rate for a whole tutin is a Gajri* or 4 kr ati on. this road.

It is also called Rah-i Paran-i-Soofi, because there is a paran or a small enclosure formed by an earthen embankment to keep out water when a sudden wind causes the waters of the Hamun to rise. The road is also called Rah-i- Gardowak because it crosses Shela-i-Gardowak, which is said to have once been very deep. to Tlhi S jn the |t Chie ' r0ad i!T SeiS 4 ntoBiriand &gt; Neh ' Banddn &gt; Meshed and mo v- i- , 3 0n hlgh g round acr °s 3 the inundated area from Afzalabad Kiih i'khwdla and cro sses three shela which carry water into the Naizar-i- vuh.1 Khvvaja. ^0 long as the road remains dry and these shela are fordable loaded amma's and men use this road, but when it is flooded are kept ai Rah-i-Tiratki or Rah-i-Surkh Gazi.

Some camels are sure to become exhausted and die from wading so long in water. If the water is cold even horses, who can stand more cold than most animals, die of exhaustion. Mr. Merk saw three ponies come across on the 1st January 1886 to Bahring, of which two died of exhaustion ; of course the depth and extent of the water was then phenomally great, and this was in a very cold time of the year. On such occasions kafila go round the south of the inunda tions, sometimes as in 1904 the inundations can be rounded not far to the south of the Kuh-i Khwaja. There are well known ridges which should be chosen for this purpose. But when the inundations reach the Kuh-i-Khw&amp;ja the wind periodically drives the water over the low-lying lands to the south and makes them wet and unfit to cross. The road then taken is that which crosses the Sar- i-Shela* or the Shelag (Baluchi). The formation at the head of the Sar-i-Shela is due to the talus of the ancient The Sar-i-Sheia. Trakii channel of the Helmand having blocked the depression, leaving only a narrow drain around the toe of the talus to carry off the surplus waters of the Harnun to the north into the Gaudd-Zireh. This channel is the Sar-i-Shela and it is the drainage line between the wash down of the hills to the south of it, and the talus or alluvial fan of the Helmand. There is a good ridge across the inundated area where this channel begins The ford at the head of the Sar-i-Shela. t0 ta ^ e S .^ a P e 5 an ^ ^ Used by flock- owners going to the hills, and was used by General Goldsmid’s Mission on their way from Bam through Turshab to Seistan.

The Sar-i-Shela was last unfordable for any length of time in 1885, but previous to that it was unfordable on more than one occasion when local events required a sudden descent on Seistdn from Kain, notably in 1 865 , when Mir Alam Khan of Kain brought a Persian Army against Taj Muhammad and was delayed at the Gardan Reg Ford to the east of the Gambad-i-Liddi by the floods in the Sar-i-Shela. In the note on the flood of 1885 in Appendix 25, at page 542, it is said that the Baluchis stat£ that the volume of the flood of 1885 was so great that it deepened and widened the Sar-i-Shela, and the waters now do not ^accumulate to so great a depth to the north of the Sar-i-Shela. In 1885 the flood waters covered all the lands round about Girdi Chah. The sides of the Sar-i-Shela are vertical and very high ; at the fords near Fords on the Sar-i-Sheia. Gumbad-TLiddi and Gardan Reg they are 35 f eet high- The bottom at the sides con sists of soft treacherous material, whilst the centre is usually occupied by a pool of beautifully blue intensely saline water, which seems neither to be absorbed by the soil or evaporated by the hot dry air. For pools only a few feet deep lasted from August 1903 to May 1905, and did not seem to have appreciably diminished, whereas the evaporation in the Northern Hamun goes on at the rate of about 10 feet a year.5 6 4 [App. 28. The fords are therefore few. * Gardan Reg Ford. f This ford will probably now get a name that will describe its situation with reference to this boundary. The most famous is that at Gardan* Reg where the Sar-i-Shela meets the sand belt. The fordf is about one mile upstream of the Perso-Afghan Boundary, and is at the place where a shela from the hills has formed a delta in the bed of the Sar-i-Shela. It is on the direct road from Girdi Chah through Kachauli to Robat. It is some times called Guzar-i- Robat. I have also heard it called Gudar-i-Shah. But the distance between sweet water is very great by this road ; and the trade route crosses at a ford six J When the Shela is not running there is a third miles higher Up near the Gumbud‘1* Llddl J and more direct ford near this ford. which is also where a ravine TUOS into the Sar-i-Shela from the hills. Both these are good fords and are only closed in years of very great and extraordinary floods, and then only from about May, when the waters may be expected to reach the Sar-bShela till about October, by which time the hot winds will have dissipated the waters and reduced the discharge through this Shela to the more normal level. It is said that water collected on the fords in the heavy rain of December 1905, and made the cross ing difficult. There are three other fords further down the Sar-i-Shela which serve roads The three ford.east of the Gardaa Reg ford. 't- ich fr0m , the d' re Ction of Bandar- i-Kamal Khan and go across to the hills to the south of the Sar-i-Shela. It may be noticed that a broad long belt of almost impenetrable sand occupies the left bank of the Sar-i-Shela from Gardan Reg to the Zidrat-i-Shahd-Mardan and the roads from the west make for the Gardan Reg ford and avoid this belt of sand, whilst the roads from the east make for the fords near Ziarat-i-Shah-i-Mardan with the same object in view. The three fords are : Guzar-i-Shamshm, 14 miles below the Gardan Reg Ford. Guzar-i-Shah-i-Mardan at the Ziarat of that name which is 7 miles below the Guzar-i-Shamshfn. Guzar-i-Sar-i-Shela-i-Rah-i-Kirtaka, 7 miles below the Ziarat of Shdh-i- Mardan. This is the place visited by General Sir Charles MacGregor in February 1877 and called by him Gumbad-i-Maksud, being thename given by his guides to the 5 domed tombs a little to the south-east of the water. It was also visited by Colonel Yate in March 1894 and called by him Gumbad-i-Sar-i-Zireh. Colonel McMahon visited it in April 1896. It was frequently used by the Mis sion transport going and coming from Quetta. All these fords are good fords, and are available except in exceptional years Sweet wat.r at the fords when the Gaud-i-Zireh is full. There is . usually sweet water to be got by excavating into the sand buried in the bed of the Sar-i-Shela at the fords. The best water is that at the Gumbad-i-Maksud and this water lasts longest. Sir Charles MacGregor got water here for his small party just before the floods of 1877 came down to renew it. Colonel McMahon got water here for his large party, in April 18 6, just before the floods of that year came down and renewed the water. ^ Both said it was the w T orst they had ever had to drink ; in April 190? it was said to be bad but drinkable. I went down the Sar-i-Shela after the flood of 1903 had renewed the water, and there was sweet water in all the pools below the point where the Perso- Afgban Boundary crosses the Sar-i-Sheia; above this point the Sar-i-Shela passes through soil of such strong alkaline properties that the water is only drinkable when it is flowing:.

There are four kinds’of mills for grinding corn in use in Seistdn. Wind- , , ., „ . ... mills, bullock-mills, water-mills and hand- mills [asm dast). From Statements A and B it will be seen that there are 34 wind-mills, 42 bullock-mills and three water mills in Persian Seistdn. More water-mills* could be arranged if the people desired them, but in the • There are only three water-mills, I each at Open plain of the delta the Wind-mill IS Warmai, Aiiabad and Chah-i-Nfma, and these are more easily arranged and is more useful ; seldom in working order. whereas up the river the water-mill is preferred ; the fall is easily got and the supply is always available, whereas the winds are uncertain. There are 12 water-mills in Afghan Seistdn, half of which belong to Govern ment to grind the wheat for the garrison ; but there are no wind or bullock- mills, and the district depends for its meal on hand-mills. A good wind-mill will grind 7 Indian maunds of wheat in 24 hours in a Outturn of min.. , wi ' d - A ' ordinary bullock mill will grind about three Indian maunds of wheat in 24 hours. A woman grinds about three-tenths of an Indian maund of w r heat a day without working at night. There are about 18,000 hand-mills in Seistdn, one in almost every house. Hand-mills. Those who cannot afford to purchase borrow. It is infradig for a man to work a hand-mill, all the labour of grinding is done by women, and the whirr of the hand-mill can be heard in their homes from long before dawn to long past dark. The surface of the stone needs to be made rough about once a. week; this is done with a long hard stone (chakush sang) or with a small iron hammer (chakush ahani) made for the purpose. The latter is the tool most used in the city. The former is a stone brought by the flock-owners from the hills ; it is a boulder chosen because it is hard, and v r orn to a long thin cylinder. The rap ping of the tool on the mill stone relieves the monotony of the whirr of the stones heard as the traveller rides through a village or encampment at dawn. 1 his rapping often serves to guide him to an encampment otherwise hid. The price of stones at the quarry is said to be one kran per span of dia- Price of stones. m ^ ter 1 the usu . al P rice is 4 to 6 kran for a pair of hand-millstones and about 100 to 120 kran for a pair of large stones (30 inches diameter) for a wind or water-mill. The cost of grinding wheat with hand-mills is usually one-third part of the Cost of grinding. co . rn g round &gt; ^ with bullock or wind mills one-fourth part of the corn ground. The Mission at times paid cash rates ; these varied a great deal from -J to f of a rupee for hand-mills and f to one rupee for wind-mills per Indian maund ground. It is not easy to get large quantities of grain ground and almost impossible to purchase it ready ground. The Mission had as much as 7,000 Indian maunds of wheat ground at Kala-i-Nau by the people of the Shahraki and Nahruf Mahdls, the maximum quantity outturned daily was too Indian maunds. Great care had to be exercised to prevent the fraudulent adulteration of the meal with earth, etc. On the first page of Chapter XXV an account of the water mill at Deh Ghulam Haidar is given. A water-mill examined at Landi VVala Muhammad Amin had a pair of stones 2' 10' in diameter and four inches thick, and was worked by a fall of 3 feet, the stones outturned about 2J Indian maunds in the 24 hours ; the discharge of the mill race was about 2 cusecs. The rate charged for grinding was 7 per cent. (1 seer in 15 seers). The revenue of the mill was divided as follows ; 9 shares to the Khan of the village, and one share divided equally between the miller, who tended to the mill, and the carpenter who repaired it. Drawings and photographs were made of wind and water-mills and are filed among the plans. [C639FD] BBS Water-mills.5 68 ■4 4 i * APPENDIX 30. CONTENTS. Biographies of Seistani Guides.

Meshedi ’Ali, age about 45, is the son of ShAh Nur, Gc 4 odar of Taifa Mish- must, Bandani. The grandfather of Meshedf ’Ali was a big man. He took cattle from Seistan and sold them in Shiraz, Ispahan and Meshed. Meshedi’s father ShAh Nur was given the Kadkhudaf of Adimi and Mansuri by Sardar Ah Khan, Sarbandi. He was a very notable man in Seistan, and had great influence over the Gaodars and SaiyAd people. When Mir Alam Khan came to Seistan, and established himself in Nasrat- dbad, he wanted ShAh Nur to be Kadkhuda of the villages of Adimi and Mansuri. But as Shah Nur had sided with the Sarbandis, he feared Mfr ’Alam Khan ; and so refused to take office under him. ShAh Nur then devoted himself to the profession of his father; took cattle from Seistan and sold them in the cities of Persia, He had got some land and gardens in Bandan over which he had hereditary rights. Meshedi ’Ali is now the owner of the estate, and every year either Meshedi ’Ali goes himself, or sends his brother to BandAn to collect his share of the land produce, and on the income from the date trees in his gardens. When ShAh Nur died, Meshedi ’Ali followed in the footsteps of his father He continued buying and selling cattle, till in the great flood of 1885, most of his cows were drowned by the floods of the Rud-i-Bandan as described in Appendix 34; and he became an almost property less man. After that he steadily made up the loss and by 1892 had collected again a large number of cattle. But the Nuh-i-Nahum in the winter of 1892-1893 described in Appendix 23 killed all his cattle by the sudden rise (due to wind) of the waters of the Sabari Hamun, and he became again almost without resources. One year later he accepted employment under Hajl MullA ’Ali Akbar. He ,894^900. ke P^ the acc ounts of the contracts, which . Haji Mulla’Ali Akbar made with the Amir, and of the collections of revenue from the cultivators. He used to count the cattle of the Haji, and indeed was his right hand man for six years in the management of his affairs. ^ For over two years after this he was the Munshi of Aga MullA Muhammad Mehdi of Husainabad, where he perform ed the same duties as he did for Haji MullA 1900*1902. 'Ali Akbar. After this he got some lands 1900-1902. in Salian, where he had lived many years before ; and put some cultivators to work to sow the lands for him. Next year he remained at Gazbar, and took some land from the son of the 1903*1904. Kadkhuda ’Ali Murad, Bandani, which he cultivated as BddAr. In the winter of 1904-05 he was at Deh Gazbar when he came into the , 90S&gt; employ of the SeistAn Mission. Meshedi’Ali says that, as he had to buy cattle from the NaizAr, he knows every nook and corner of and every Khel in the NaizAr. He had to deal with the SaiyAds also; and being the son of an influential man, every SaiyAd and every GdodAr respected him. He wentto Neh, BandAn, and to Sarhad once every year, and by different routes. He therefore had to cross the FarAh and Harud Rud, and he knew all the country in Aukat-i-SeistAn, and about the NaizAr very well. His father had got some lands near SaliAn in Aukat-i-SeistAn, which Meshedi ’Ali also cultivated as BAdAr for several years. Meshedi ’Ali also went to the PuzAk HAmun to collect taxes for Kadkhuda Muhammadi from the SaiyAd people living on the PuzAk; and therefore he has57° [App. 30. been all over the PuzAk Hdmun also. A short biographical sketch of Gulmir &gt; son of Dost Muhammad. % Gulmir is the son of Dost Muhammad, Baluch, Taifa Shaikh Hasaini, resident of Deh Shahgul, on the bank of the Parian river. His age is about 45 years; he is a strong man, and very smart, and is a good guide for Persian Seistin. He says that, when Sharif Kh£n, Nahrui, besieged the city of Nasrat- 4 bdd, he was with the besiegers. He was then (1873) a boy and could hardly carry a rifle. When he came of age, he got the village of Kaftdrgl from Mir ’Alam Khdn ; and remained Kadkhuda of that village for some years. Then he had to give up the village of Kaftdrgifor some reason, and he became the Mushrif of Deh Khalikdad ; after a few years he went into Afghan Seistdn; and became a Gdodar near Nad-i-Ali. He had then got a very large herd of cattle, and Akhunzada Mulld. Facpr Muhammad K.hdn, Hakim of Chakhd.nsur, knew him well. He used to graze his cattle between Nad-i-Ali and Jahdndbdd. and about Karko and Margo. In the flood of 1885, Gulmir was at Jahdndbdd. He had stationed himself on a big mound, and his cows were kept at the foot of the mound, when all of a sudden one midnight the water reached this place, and in a few hours covered all the country around. The cows, calves and the sheep were suddenly surrounded by water, and Gulmir could with difficulty save three cows and a, few ^oats • for these he had to bring fodder from distant places by swimming. Y\ hen the floods subsided, Gulmir went to Surkh Dik, a very small village near Shahristdn-i-Kuhna. By selling, or mortgaging all that he had left, he got the Kadkhudai of that village, which he kept tor several successive years. K^dkhudas of Seistdn are liable to become bankrupt very soon • and Gulmir soon found himself unable to keep the village. He therefore became an ordinary Bazgar, and tilled lands till he was employed by the Irrigation Party of the Seistdn Mission in March 1903. Since then, till May 1905, he was in the employ of the Mission as guide for Persian Seistan. ou Being a man of industrious habits, he is known to almost all men in the Sharaki and Nahrui villages. Once in the company of Taj Muhammad of Kimak he went to Herat; and when Kadkhuda of Kaftdrgi and Surkh Dik villages he had many occasions to go and see the city of Nasratdbdd, and other notable villages m Seistdn. Having been a Kadkhuda and Mushrif, he knows everything about cultivation, and therefore is in a position to supply good and reliable infer- mation about the system of cultivation in Seistdn. Biography of the old Arbdb Saif-ud-din. The Arbdb Saif-ud-din is a very old man full of energy with a large store of legendary knowledge. He says that he is 96 (in 1904), but he also states ‘ f a l TT W ‘ th h i S £ e ° p,e t0 meet Colonel Leach at Kandahar at the time of the Kabul war, and that he was then about 10 or 15 years of age This would make him about 80 years of age. He had an English rupee which he said vas one of the many that Colonel Leach gave his relatives and himself. He has a retentive memory and recollects Lieutenant Pattinson, and introduced htsnamein conversation and that of many others, who were well known in Afghanis^ at the time of the Kabul war. He also met the members of General Pollock, General Goldsmid and Colonel West Ridgeway’s Mission. As a youth he was passionately fond of riding and hunting, and travelled about the deserts around Seistan with parties organised by the Sanjarani Sardars T? u 1116 °Pj an( ^ W1 ^ . ass; at t ^ at l ’ me the arbdb, who now lives at Deh Dost Muhammad near Kala-i-Fath, lived at Chaharburjak. He had a great talent for remembering all the historical and revenue details that he heard from his elders ; many of whom were men like himself with a genius for antiquarian lore, and knew the traditions of Seistdn. 4 an * * * * * 5ie *But the last of these disappeared with Malik Gulzar Khan, Kaiyani, who died in May 1903; the oral traditions are now but imperfectly known amon^ the people, and the old Arbab often said that he himself had but a smattering of the subject compared to the knowledge possessed by men, whom he had met, and who are long since dead. The old Arbab’s family managed the revenues of the Garmsel for genera tions^ and he points out near Chigini, the home where his immediate ancestor pve in the days when the buildings along the river, that are now in ruins, where inhabitated. The old arbab married a cousin, a daughter of Arbab Shah Jahan, who was one of the last of the men who kept the revenue accounts of the Garmsel. He has four sons Nasir-ud-din, who is a cultivator at Deh Kaliq Dad in Persian Seistan, Akhtar Muhammad, who is a trader and goes to Quetta, Lai Muham mad and Burzu (named after a hero of the Shah Namah), who are young and live at Deh Dost Muhammad Arbab near Kala-i-Fath. When Muzaffar-ud daula, Wakil-ul-Mulk, came to Seistan the Arbab acted as go-between for Sardars Kamal Khan and Imam Khan and received a khillat and 500 kran for his services. He was among the besiegers when Sardars Sharif Khan and Ibrahim Khan attacked the city of Nasirabad. In 1884 he married a Kaiyani girl, a relative of Malik Gulzar Khan. His father Arbab Ismail Khan was a man of means and left him very well off, so that he has never needed to follow any settled occupation. But he is now dependent on his sons, and on the Sanjarani Sardars and Kadkhuda Dost Muhammad, Arbab, who allow him a small share of the grain of one of their ploughs.

People used to sow melons and millet on lands rigated from its water. In 1871, when the river almost dried up, Sarddr Shdrif t Thete canal* «re aVandoned K hdn.

From Shela-i-Jharuki they carried the water to Nadw-’Ali, and sowed iW*/crops there. ex year in 1872, they sowed wheat and barley as well as khart/ on this canal. In too, wheat was sown, but the rebellion broke out; and Sharif Khin be* steged ShahM-Seistan. Ihe crops were destroyed, and the canal was also neglected. Ik * After this only sabzfjar (kharlf) was done on the Jharuki. Six months before the flood of the Sdl-.-Barf came, Sarddr Khdn Jdhdn Khdn, employed men for months together to open the mouth of the Jharuki. They succeeded in t Such » »pur i* called a Ruta-i-ju. carrying a little water and sowed some . . . . wheat. That year they built a spurt near* y across the river, up to wnhm 200 feet of the left bank. The flood of 1877 however, silted up the head of Shela-i-Jharuki. * In 1888, Dddi was given the Kadkhudai of the villages on the Shela-i- Jharuxi. Dadi put his hashar on the head reach. The depth of digging was tremendous, and there were pavj alam or five lifts for the diggers to ^raise the earth with their iesha, which means that five men stood on the^slope, and work- t There was a in herein October 1SS4 den* f^TOW the earth from the bed OT1 tO the banka - Dddi then made the firs ‘^ bani 1L , . , . . across the river at the head of Shela-i- Jharuki, and irrigated all the lands. v\. ^ The same year, Sultan Muhammad Gurgej of Khoga cleared out the canal which Sardar Sharif Khan had dug in 1871, and made a tamarisk aqueduct at tne head of the Shela-i-Jharuki to pass the water of the canal on to the lands of 1 Kang is an island ; in this case a piece of land Kang-i-Rahimdcld. This kcing \ W 3 S after* with canal or river channel on all sides. wards called Kang-i-Din Muhammad, and a part of it is now called Kang-i-Karimddd. From the year 1888 to about the year 1901, Uddi built his band across the main river at the head of Shela-i- Jharuki every year; and reclaimed a very large area along the Shela. The tamarisk aqueduct, too, w^as made every year, till 1903 when the flood further silted up the head of the Shela; after this the Hakim of Chakfdnsur put two earthen band across this Shela, and carried the water of the Sultdni canal across it town to Nad-i-’Ali. Up to 1903-04 a large bed of high and well grown bulrushes {tut) grew at the end of the Shela. But now that its head is closed by the Sultani embank- merit the tut will probably dry up and disappear. * It may bn useful to «ote here that the strip of country along the boundary from Kuhak to Fapa-i-Talai was surveyed on a scale of two inenes to the mile by the Surrey of India. The Shelas referred to in this Appen &gt;.ix will be found therein, and this Appendix may perhaps be a useful help to understanding that map. The vagaries of the river described in this Appendix are typical of all the flowing channel* In the Helmand Delta (and also of all the other deltas in ih?

Shelas on the left bank of the river below Shdhgul. Shela-i-Pokak or Shela-i- Jahatiabad. Before the flood of 1885, the lands where Pokak and several small villages in the Jam of Pokak now stand, belonged to Deh Aga Jdn. The land on which Shela-i-iah£n 4 bdd now runs was all under cultivation ; it was a strip of land lower than the land on either side. The River Helmand had breached its banks at this very place two or three times before 1885, but the cultivators repaired the breach in the protection embankment and saved their fields. But in 1885 the flood was an extraordinary one ; it burst through the embankment at the place where Pokak now is, and swept away Kala-i-Nau, Jah&amp;nabad, Aga Jan, etc., etc. Since that time Shela-i-Jahan£b£d carried water till the year 1895 and 1896, when the present channel of the Rud-i-Parian was formed, the head of the Shela- i-Jahindbad then silted up or was left high and dry, and it has not carried water again. The head of Shela-i-Jahandb&amp;d was at Chaluki, so called because there was a big hole just under the protection embankment, from which men used to take earth to repair the embankment. The river burst its banks at this place 3 or 3 times; and the pit was usually full of water and contained numerous fish. The Shela was therefore called Shela-i-Chaluki. It passed south of Pokak, south west of old Jah&amp;nabid, then past the Diwal-i-Duzdan, Dikki and Malikki ; and then to Daulat&amp;bad, Khamak and so into the Naizar. Margo and Jalal£b£d were destroyed by the flood, and the lands beyond Jahanabdd became Naizar. JanjaL In 1896 Dost Muhammad, son of ’Ali Khdn, Saruni, moved the head of his canal from near Deh Lalla to where it is now, i.e. y below Burj-i-’As on the Nad-i- ’Ali channel. This was done because the Shela-i-Charkh drew at this time al most all the water of the Nad-i-’Ali channel of the Helmand, so that the Sikh- sar was often nearly dry. When Dost Muhammad moved the head of this canal upstream to the head of the Shela-i-Chdrkh, there was a quarrel about water. Dadi made the two canals, one called Go Kushta, which ran to Ibrahimabad, and the other Nobar-i-Sikhsar, which he made from the head of the Shela-i-Chkrkh, and dropped it into the Sikhsar; he then closed the Chirkh altogether. To feed the Charkh Dadi made a Paling or feeder from the river about 500 feet upstream of the head of the Charkh. The water in the river soon rose and all quarrels were settled. Moladad Khan came from Farah to settle this quarrel. Two • The Afghan cut or ju-i-Afghan. ^ teV this5 ’ *'* &gt; in the Afghans made Nobar-i-Shdhgul*. The Lakhshak earned water from its old head in the Nad-i-’Ali channel below Burj-i-’As. In the next year 1899 the Afghans said that they would give water only for the Dost Muhammad canal ; and they closed the Lakhshak at its head. Khdn Jin ' Khan opened it; the Afghans again closed it. d his was done, as there is a big draw of water from the Nad-i-’Ali channel into the Shelad-Lakhshak and the supply can only be controlled with difficulty. At last Khan Jan Khan made a paling, i.e., feeder from above Burj-i-As. The Afghans closed this also and there was another quarrel, and therefore this paling was sometimes called Janjal. Khin Jan Khan then did what the Afghins had wanted him to do all along and made a cut from the Ju-i-Jahinibid, which took out of the Rud-i- Parian above the Band-i-Pariin, and fed the Pokak series of canals from it. In 1903, this paling was cut into by the river, and re-opened direct from the Nad-i-’Ali channel; it ran till March 1904. In July 1904 the Afghans and Persians amicably co-operatedf and put a good deal of tamarisk into its head to control the amount of water to the Lakhshak series of canals. The Lakhshak series of canals were fed from this paling all through the cold weather of 1904-05 and up to the time that the Mission left Seist^n* Sar- ddr Khdn Jdn Khan collected his cultivators and worked on the Band-i-Paridn to divert water into the Nad-i- Ah channel, and so feed this system of canals. Shela-i-Lakhshak. The lands where the Shela-i-Lakhshak runs were also under cultivation 'up to 1885, as was the case with the lands under the Shela-i-Jahdnabtid already t In 1905 they quarrelled throughout the period of low river about the regulation of this channel and finally on the 30th of November the Persians burnt the tamarisk weir that the Afghans had built a few days before. ^579 App. 31.] described ; these lands too were low. The embankments at the head of the Chdrkh and lower down, on the main stream of the Helmand tended to raise the level of the river. On both banks of ihe river there were strong protection em bankments, but the level of the country on the left bank of the river was general” ly lower than that on the right. The Shela-i-Lakhshak was formed at the time of the flood of 1885. After the flood the land of Milak was given to Sard£r Khan J£n Khdn who put an embankment around the lands of Milak and cultivated them. A flood of ordi nary dimensions which came a few years later (probably 1889) carried away the crops of Milak. Kh£n J&amp;n Kh&amp;n then went to Chilingak and made a home there for himself. Deh Saiydd was the first village established after the flood of 1S85 by him. Deh Shaikh, Deh Ydr Muhammad, and Kang Lalla followed. In 1894, an earthen band was put across the Shela-i-Lakhshak, below Jahdn- £bdd, to feed several small canals for Siddak. one of which irrigates lands near Karko Shdh in the Jam of Deh Dost Muhammad. From 1894 to 1896, at flood times this earthen band was swept away almost every year; but since 1896 no damage has been done to this band as the Shela-i-Lakhshak has been fed from the canal, and is under control. In 1894, Siddak was established and most of the lands near Siddak were re claimed. Shela-i-Ghar Gharruki. This was a branch of Shela-i-Jahdndbdd running to the south of Diwal-i- Duzd, and dropping into the Shela-i-Lakhshak west of Karko Shdh. The bed of the Shela-i-Lakhshak was at a very much lower level, and the slope in the bed of the Shela-i-Ghar Gharruki was therefore steep. The water therefore made a gurgling sound as it flowed down this Shela, and Ghar Gharruki is an onoma- topoetic word expressing this sound. Band across Sikhsar above and below Burj-i-As.

Sarddr Ibrahim Khdn saw that he could not resist the Persians ; he therefore gave his daughter in marriage to Mir 'Alam Khan, of Kdin and thus made friends with him. All Khdn, father of Dost Muhammad Khdn, was the Kadkhudd of D^eh Margo for merly^ village belonging to Sarddr Ibrahim Khdn, Mir ’Alam Khdn won him over to his side and gave him the control of the collection of the cattle tax, etc. »Ali Khdn, being a Baluch, became a mediator between the Persians and the San- iardnis, and made the Sikhsdr the boundary between 1 ersian Seistan and the territory of Ibrdhim Khdn; since then the Sikhsdr has been the Sim or bound ary between Persian and Afghdn Seistdn. (1) There were five band across the Helmand and Sikhsdr below Milak. The first was called Band-i-Marungi or Band-i-Balach. Balach was a Rakh- shdm Baluch. He w&gt;as a big Kadkhudd. His son, Zaman Khdn, was killed in a skirmish about 5 years ago. The Akhunzada Fakir Muhammad, Hakim of Chakhdnsur, took the daughter of Zaman Khdn in marriage. This band was made a little above Reg-i-Shohbat called by the Mission Bela s ford, near Deh Sham- sudini, west of Nad-i-’Ali : the canal was a big one, and it became very wide and deep after a few years. This canal went to Marungi, Dasht-i-Paran, passing between Safid Dik and Surh Dik at Nad-i-’Ali and to Diwalak and Deh Fakir Muhammad. Shela-i-Marungi can still be traced. The band was never built after the flood of 1885. [C639FD] EEE580 [App. 31 . (2) The second band was called Band-i-’As or Band-i-Dddi, so called after the name of Kadkhud£ Mdi of Afghan Seistdn. This band was built at the head of the Sikhsdr, or about one thousand yards below Burj-i-As. It was made to divert water into Shela-i-Dddi, now called Shela-i-Chdrkh. D£di had made a cut (now called the Ch&amp;rkh canal) to feed the Shela-i-D^di. This cut was at that time called Nobar-i-Dadi. Shela-i-Dddi was not s® deep as it is now. It was deep ened by the flood of 1885. It used to irrigate the lands of Deh Dddi,* Kala-i- • The Russo-Afghan Boundary Commission CtC., as it does OOW. The Surplus camped at this village on the 29th October i8d 4 . water used to go into the Naizdr. The Akhundzada took away the village from Dadi later on. This band was never made after the flood of 1885. (3) The third band was Band-i-’Ali Khdn. This was made where Deh Lala and Deh Gul Muhammad Beg now are. The traces of the band are still visible. This band was made by ’AH Kh£n, Saruni, and Dost Muhammad Khdn, his son, to divert water into the Dost Muhammad canal. The Afghans also took out a small water-course above the band for Deh Taus, Deh Gul Muhammad Beg, Deh Ido, etc. This band was built every year even after 1885, till Dost Muham mad shifted the head of his canal to the site where it is now. This was done about 1896 or 1898. nel. (4) The fourth band was called Band-i-Shamshfri.f This was built by the f Shamshfri is a name for a swift flowing chan- Afghans, Opposite Deh Ido.

His son, Sher Jan, is still the Kadkhuda of Deh Muhammad J&amp;n. (5) The fifth band vas called Band-i~BahIol. It was made every year by Kadkhuda Bahlol of Sikhsar, to irrigate lands in Afghdn Seistan. When the supply falls very low, an earthen band is even now put across the Sikhsdr, and all the water is run into canals on the Afghan side ; Bahloi’s son, Madad Khdn, now makes this band. When the supply of the Sikhsar is ample, some water is allow ed by the Afghans solely at their own discretion into water-courses belonging to the Persians. This earth band is still made every year. Some of the mam Shelas below Burj-i-As. Rtid-i-Shagalak. —In Sal-i-Barf, a Shela was formed which took out from the Sikhsdr near the place where Deh Lalla is now, and ran into the Naizdr south-west of Karku Shah. In 1881 Ghulam Haidar first made an earthen band in the Sikhsdr below Deh Luch, and Dadi made a canal from the Shela-i-Shagalak at its head, and dropped it into the Sikhsdr below the band of Ghulam Haidar. In 1SS5, tins Shela became a big river. It was called Shagalak because the lands through which it passed were called by the name of Shagalak The first band ms put across this Rud in 1886, and every year till 1895, when the Paridn was formed, this was renewed Rud-i-Shagalak ran to the south-west of Karku Shdh and then flowed northward, then to the north-east, and ran into Rud-i-Shamshin north of Deh Khamar. In 1895 Rud-i-Shagalak became silted up, and in 1896 completely dried up. Shela-i-Shamshiri—Long before Sal-i-Barf, i.e., 1877, Shela-i-Shamshfri flowed into the Naizdr. Dddi says that, in 1881, when he made Naubdr-i- bikhsar^ it was flowing. But a year or two afterwards ’ Ali Khan Saruni banded it at its head, and built his village of Deh Dost Muhammad on its banks!

Rud-i-Shagalak, Rud-i-Lakhshak and Shela- i-Ghar Gharruki ran into the Naizdr at the same place north of Karku Shdh. Shela-i-Khar Kushta. —This Shela also exists from olden times. When the Helmand ran into the Naizdr at the tail of the Sikhsdr, Khar Kushta was one of the many Shelas there. The people say it is so called because a donkey was drowned while crossing it. This Shela took out from the Sikhsdr north of Deh Dost Muhammad, and ran into Shela-i-Shamshfri south of Deh Khamar, when 'AH Kh£n reclaimed lands about the site of the village of Deh Dost Muhammad ;he banded Shela-i- Khar Kushta also. Burj-i-Alamdar . This is a small mound with a few walls of an ancient ruin, north of Deh Ibranimabad. This mound was in the Naizcir, and men who have seen the place can still recognize the mound (according to Dadi). The old Arbdb says that ’Alam Khdn, son of Shah Dost, Sanjardni, came to live here with Jdn Beg Baluch ; at that time Seistdn was in chaos and confusion. He made a small tower and stationed himself in it with 100 men. Since then, it has been called Burj-i-Alamdar. Chi ling ak.~-T bis is a series of small ruins on small mounds from ancient times. The Jam of Khin Jdn Khdn is called Jam-i-Skidak and Chilingak. Before Siddak was reclaimed, this tract was Naizdr, called Naizar-i-Chilingak. Now that the lands about the place are reclaimed, the circle is called Chilingak and Siddak. The account brought up to date by Captain Macpherson. The following note of the alterations made in the canals near the boundary since May 1905 has been kindly supplied by Captain A. D. Macpherson, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Seistan. (1) The Jahanabdd canal now takes off at the separation of the Nad-i- ’Ali channel from the Helmand and just above the Band-i-Parian. (2) The Lakhshak takes off 2X janjal opposite Burj-i-As. (3) The village of Milak is now situated about three quarters of a mile to the north of its present site on the map. ( 4 ) A small canal has been cut by Sai’d Khdn (our late Jemadar of levies) from about the centre of the Ju-i-Afghan or New Cut towards Jaroki. ( 5 ) A small canal has been cut by Ghulam Khdn, Ghilzai, from just below the junction of the Ju-i-Afghan with the Nad-i-’Ali channel towards the land known as Zamin-i-Chulk. (6) A light band has been thrown across the Helmand during the last few days by the Afghans at Shahgul to feed the New Cut. (7) A substantial band has been built across the mouth of the Lakhshak canal by the Afghans to prevent too much water flowing down that stream ; 1 do not know yet whether the Persians will allow the above two band to remain there will probably be a dispute over the latter*. (8) There was no water in the Sikhsdr stream on the 27th November. Such water as reached the mouth of it all flowed down the Ju-i- Charkh. The bed of the Sikhsar appeared to be a couple of feet above the present level of the water in the Ju-i-Charkh. * It was but a few days after the above was written.APPENDIX 32. CONTENTS.

This is so called after the name of an ancient fort called Kala-i-Aerandaz. It is about 13 miles along the river Guzar-i-Aerandaz, r /^i 1 1 ' * r ~r 1 1 1 i from Chakhansur. 1 he bed ot the river has no gravel, but the ford is not slippery. When the river is in flood, the people cross on gourds or rafts. This ford is for the village of Kadda; at flood time this ford disappears ; „ . Ir ,, in 1904 at flood time it was not fordable. Guzar-i-Kadda. This road is between Aleli on the left bank and Gikan and Kadda on the right bank. The ford is a good one. When there is cne kad or about six feet of water at Guzar-i-Aerandaz, there is about 4’o feet at Aleli. Band-i-Kadda is well-known, and is about three hours’ walk below Guzar-i- Aleli. It is made with shingle put in gabi- Band-iKadda. ax/’U * ' 1 ons. When the supply in the river is lew not a drop of water goes below Band-i*Kadda. Ju-i-Kadda takes out above Band-i Kadda, and is a big canal of about 12 feet bed width. The bed of the river here has small gravel on it. About six miles above Guzar-i-Aleli is the Padag*-i-Sarddr Ibrahim Khdn. From this ford to Gurguri there is no Padag-i-Sardar. tamarisk on the Khdsh Riid. The chan nel runs through a gorge in the dasht ; the plain or dasht is so level that the gorge has no distinguishing mark that would catch the eye of a man travelling over the dasht towards the Riid, so that he comes upon the gorge suddenly and only realizes its presence when he stands on the edge overlooking the river. It is said that some years ago four travellers died of thirst only a short distance from the river, because they did not know that the river was so close to them. The same effect is obtained at some parts of the dasht of the Helmand gorge above Bandar-i-Kamal Kh&amp;n and along the Riid-i-Sena. At places the traveller descends from one terrace to another; at others he moves over a level plain and there is no indication of the proximity of the gorge on its level surface. At Gurguri the river is said to fall two or three Sar, i.e., about io or 15! feet over a vertical cliff. The river then flows Gur8Url * through the gorge in the dasht above des cribed. Above Gurguri the river flows with a gentle current, but when it ap proaches Gurguri it flows swiftly. Though the depth of the river is not great, yet people do not cross here through fear of being carried away into the whirlpool below the rapid. Gurguri is an onomatopoetic word to imitate the noise of the water over the fall, and which the Baluchis say is like Ghdm Ghdm. The pool below is said to be about 300 feet long and 50 feet wide with an inconceivable depth. This pool never dries. According to Saffar and Hamid Khdn, it is Zinda-du, there is a spring. The water from this pool always overflows in a small stream in the bed of the Rud-i*Khdsh, and when it reaches Gikan (about 10 miles below Gurguri) it disappears in the gravel (shana). d he people of Gikan are not energetic enough to utilize this water. Whatever small efforts they have made to carry this water into their canal have so far failed. The v r ater in this pool is sweet.

When the river rises, the water overflows the top of the band. People to repair it add more gabions and stones to the top. The canal is very ancient. There is no necessity to clear silt from this canal. It draws a large supply of water. No one now remembers who first made this band. About 20 miles above the Band-i-Lukhi is the head of Jud-Deh Pusht-i- Perenniat supply in the Rud-i-Khash. Hasan. The water in the Rud-i-Kh£sh reaches the head of Ju-i-Deh Pusht*i-Has- an throughout the whole year. This canal is as big as the Khwdja Ahmad canal (carrying say eight cusecs). Half of Deh Pusht-i-Hasan belongs to Arbab Ghulam Haidar, who possesses Lukhi village ; and the other half belongs to Mir Afzal Khan, son of Abdul Nabi Khan, Afghan. Above Kadda, as has already been said, the Rud-i-Khdsh flows through a Nohor from the Khash Rud. ^ eG P narr O w g or g e CUt through high dasht. Below Kadda there are small chan nels from the Riid-i-Khdsh, that flow into the Naiz&amp;r, such channels are called Nohor* or escapes or distributaries.

(2) Nohor-i-Shah Ghes takes out from the Khdsh near Chakhansur, and runs into the Nohor-i-Kalukhi at Dik-i-Arbdo. Nohor-i-Shah Ghes runs through cultivated lands; while Kalukhi runs at the foot of the dasht. Nohor-i-Shah Ghes was flowing on the 16th of April i 9 ° 5 . On the left bank of the Kh£sh Rud there are four Nohor : — (1) Nohor-i*Sahib Khan ; this Nohor takes out above the head of Nohor-i- Kalukhi. (2) Nohor-i-Safar Khdn. (3) Nohor-i-Rahmat. (4) Nohor-i-Makhi which was in flow on the 16th April 1905. All these four Nohor were made by people to irrigate lands. The river at one time or another made them useless as canals, and they are now like shelas.

Safar, son of Nur Din, and two ether Baluch guides were sent to take the measurements of a section of the Rud-i-Khash at a place where the channel w^as regular and undivided. They Tvent to Aleli, one day’s journey above the tail of the Rud-i-Khash, at Chakdnsur. At Aleli the river runs between high banks ; the bed has gravel, and the channel is regular for some distance both up and down stream of the point, where the Baluchis measured their section. The discharge on the 18th March 1905 was 458 cusecs, and the mean velocity 2*6 feet a second. The measurements of the same section were again taken by the same Baluchis on the 16th April 1905, the discharge was 1,473 cusecs and the mean velocity 3*33 feet a second. There is a steep slope in the bed of this part of Rud-i-Khash ; at the fords a man cannot cross the stream when the depth of water is more than 3'5 feet. In 1903 the flood in the Riid-i-Khdsh must have come down very early in , the winter, and lasted later than usual into 1903 and 1904. ^, r 1 , the summer tor about 200 cusecs where still flowing early in August when Sub-overseer Had Singh took his level sec tion of the delta. In 1904 the flood w r ater reached Chakh&amp;nsur on the 24th February; the supply was ample to sow and mature the crop, but the river dried up early in June. * Perhaps tho word is \ahru.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000884.0x00039a_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/20/23</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000884.0x00039a</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/20/23</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Seistan.
