Assistant to Chief Engineer Yehia Fahmy on projects like the construction of the Library on AUC's Greek Campus, he was responsible for campus maintenance, engineering and renovation projects until becoming Chief Engineer in 2004, a position in which he served for a decade. Other projects he discusses include the Old Falaki Building alterations and renovation of the Sheikh Rihan Villa as the Rare Books and Special Collections Library. During the final stages of the construction of AUC's new campus in New Cairo, Abdel Gawad oversaw the completion of portions of buildings like the Schools of Sciences and Engineering, and Humanities and Social Sciences, and managed aspects of the move of equipment and other property to the campus, as well as the selection of a vendor for AUC’s bus service. He also speaks about his musical career earlier in his life, as a member of a band and guitar teacher for Gamal Abdel Nasser’s son.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>oral histories</dc:type><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017; American University in Cairo.
