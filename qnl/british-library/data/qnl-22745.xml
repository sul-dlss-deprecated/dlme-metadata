Political Eeeident in the lersian Guli Bushire.•'/I British Embassy* Jedda* No. 1693/ 6/30 5 th ilarch 1 950 CONFIDENTIAL We have noticed at paragraph 14- ( v ij Bahrain Intelligence Suiiiiiary for the latter half of January that a Bahraini is reported to have been flogged to death at al Khobar for the heinious offence of playing a lute. 2. We should like to have any confirmation or details of this wh'ch you nay possess. We are as you know concerned with the administration of Saudi 'justice' as it affects British protected persons working here as well as citizens of the United Kingdom, and would welcome further information 3. Should there be a case in v/hich injustice has clearly been done to a Bahraini, would you consider it within our province to take up cudgels on his behalf? Y/e are not sure whether our responsibility for the conduct of the Shaikh’s foreign relations extends to the consular sphere or not. a copying this letter to Rogers at the Eastern C.J.
