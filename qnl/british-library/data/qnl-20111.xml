Subject:- Muscat State Hevised Budget 1 or 1952 ^ Sir r&gt; X have the honour to refer to paragraph 4 of my memorandum L T o.c/97 of 5th ray 1932, and to add that the question of further economies in the Budget of the Husc&amp;t ota^e for this year lias 'been under the close consideration of His Highness the Sultan, Captain Aroan, Hie Financial Adviser and myself. The final paragraph of my letter No.C/283 of lOtli December 1931, in which I summed u^. my comments on the Budget for this year, concluded with the recommendation that - subject to any remarks v*hich Captain Alb an had to maice he hac. then no l . 'calcen u ^ j his duties as Financial Adviser) - we might give our approval to the Budget. A copy of my letter was given to Captain Alban on arrival, and he concurred in ny recommendation. 3. In ma Jang up the Budget His Highness and his Accountant General had oased their estimate of Revenue cr ohe .ecelpts lor l^ol, allowing for a drop in 1932 of about ..is.50,U0U» The year 1931 was in itself a bad /ear m xact the worst from the Revenue point of view sincea regular Budget was introduced about 12 yeara a^o. It was tlierefore reasonably ho^ed tiiat the Budget ebt-tmte of recex^ts was a sai'e one* Unfortunately tliis has not been the case, and from the experience gained in the first half year Captain Alban estimates that there .all be a drop in reoexpts ( on the Budget estimate) m Customs dues of up to RS.50/J00 Captain Alban ba^es hie estimate on the factors enumerated in the next paragraph. 4«. (a) Serious decrease in imports specially of rice, wet dates, sugar and coffee as compared with the corres ponding period of i93i« (b) ITall in prices of The above articles. (c) Decrease in exports of dry and wet daues and dried and salted fish* (d) Since March last almost total cessation of the lar, ;J&gt; e exijort of Kasha i.e. fish manure and a drop.' of no less than from 120 to &amp; 30 ^er Bcahar of the small amount tnat continues to be ex^eirted. (e) Drop in price of dates ( dry and wet) produced in the Muscat State and Oman. (f) in all previous years from January to July inclusive the months of April and May have shown very subs tan ti y ially higher revenue returns than the other months of the same period. This year, however, no such increase has been recorded and a drop of iis .31,y00 revenue, as compa red with the corresponding months of the last year, has occurred. (g) The last 5 months of the year usually show increased revenue figures. Owing however to the serious drop in the price of dates and the cessation of export of Kasha ( see a above ) , Y /e are not warranted in an*- ticipating any such increase during the latter part of the present year# (h) Receipts for the first 5 months of the year totalledxis#1,700, whidi sum incxuaes comparatively good revenues or the months of January, February and larch i.e. 'before the complete slump in price and export of Kasha. It is not safe thereior® under these circumstances to assume a higher total revenue for the remaining months of the year than Rs.210&gt;000, ©r a total Customs revenue for the year iy52 of about ris.400 ,000 i .e. Hs »50,000 less than the last year. 5o I discussed the matter witn Captain Alban, and when His i-i^hness -• to whom Ox course Captain Alban had first communicated his apprehension$— approached me I su tJt jet&gt;ted tiiat the first tiling to do was for His Eighness to be satisfied that the deficit esti mate of his Pinancial Adviser was correct. If Captain Alban could convince him tiiat his estimate &gt;vas correct we would liave to con*» sider how the deficxt was to be met. If Captain Alban could not convince him then we would reconsider the Ljatter. 6. His Highness after a detailed examination of tne estiirate - he has a distinct flair for figures and finance • inioimed me that it would certainly be prudent to allow for the drop prognosticated by Captain Alban. The latter officer and myself then went int® details and produced for His Highness*s consideration a number of economies which, by producing- more than the sum required, ^ave His Highness a choice as to which proposals he would adopt. Various discussions followed between His Highness, Captain Alban and myself and finally His Highness approved of the economies : ,iven in paragraph 8. 7. The situation briefly is as fullows:- Budget 1922. Revenue from all sources was estimated at Rs.702, 100 ( Customs Revenue with Landing chargea was estinated at Rs. 450,000 ) Expenditure under all heads ( not inciudir^ repayment of debts) v/as estimated at * 676,300 Balance credit '* 25 ,800 But financial Adviser estimates a fall-4— ^1 in Customs Revenue of RB»50 t 000o Therefore Hevenue Troiu si.ll souroes \vi 11 be As painted out m puragrajii 5 of my letter No»0/283 quoted above the late Sultan 1 a allowance of Rb»2000 per month or rls®24000 per annum was not included in the Budget• When this is allowed for the total expenditure comes to ' 700,.'JJO Balance aebit ^ 46.&gt;300 &amp;• His KigJainess• s proposals to c^ver triis deiicit a-e as followat— ^^ Amount surrejiiered from BuuLiet iBstimates :.o»x.l&gt;000 Public Dorics Department as. 14,000 Furniture n 1&gt;000 Contingencies ' 1,'JOO Defence ' o^OOO# This is extra to item 4, and is made up of pay ^ of Jemadar, 3rd Indian Oiiicer, not yet I ^ ^ enlisted; about 30 recruits not enlisted ^ io^ - during the first 2 months of the year; ' ' ' v ' ^ ^ay of the saving on Levy xsff Commandant ircm 1-26th January, and other small items* Reducti ona *. 2» 3ducation » His Highness proposes to close down the school altogether until better txines.

Memorandiim^ wnile the year 1932 has been marked by falling revenues in all directions it is satisfactory to be able to report that in consequence of the new assessment of Zakat revenue in a more up to date manner a substantial increase in receipts is promised under this heading# 2, The Batinah and Shimaliyeh coasts comprise the largest stretch of continuous date cultivation in » / ! ? f . the world. The plantations extend in almost unbroken regularity for close on 200 miles* Numerous varieties of dates and other trees are found^by far the most popular of which is the Batni date, which, though inferior in quality, has the advantage of being able to ripen in spite of the excessive humidity of the sea coast, next to the Batni date comes the 'Mebsili 1 , which when boiled and dried is known as the •Bisr 1 and is largely exported to india for consumption at marriage feasts and other entertainments. 3 # The Batinah coast is by ancient custom, divided into 9 'Walayats 1 or districts* These, commencing from the town of Muscat itself are Sib, BArkah masnaah, Suwaiq, Khaboorah, Saham, Sohar, Liwa and Shimaliyeh. Previous to this year four of these 9 districts have been paying a more or less adequate Zakat. These2# These were i^Arkah, tiaham, sohar and l»i 7 7a« Of the remaining 5 districts 3 i.e. bib, lUiaboorah and Shimaliyeh ^ere paying purely nominal sums and the last two buwaiq and Masnaah paid nothing at all. 4^ This year out of the total 9 distrtits seven i.e. Sib, Birkah, Khaboorah, Saham, Sohar, l-iwa and Shimaliyeh have been fully assessed to Zakat revenue while the two districts, jiasnaah and Suwaiq, which ha'/e never yet paid Zakat revenue have been left out. 5 # i^o serious opposition other than the usual grumbles of the tax payer was met witn except in the ci^e of one or two small villages wnere the assessing party were reiused entrance by the oheiicha. These difficulties, however, were all settled amicably as trie., arose and my latest mrormation shows tnat work in the districtsis progressing smootniy.

Sir, I have the honour to enclose herewith a report from Captain Alban on the assessment of the Batinah and Shiaaliyeh areas of the Muscat Btate which he carried out in his capacity of Financial Adviser. 2. As you are aware the Muscat State has toeen hard hit by the general trade depression, and a half-yearly adjustment of the State Budget was rendered necessary owing to a serious drop in the general revenue (vide my letter Ho. 541-S of the 5th August 1952). Moreover in little more than two years from now the State will lose the Arms Traffic subsidy of Rs. 1,00,000 (vide Government of India Express Letter Ho. F.161-H/32, of 30th June 1932). If the State therefore is to waather the depression, almost literally every rupees increase in its revenue is of con sequence. The prospect therefore of raising more revenue from the date districts of the Batinah and shimaliyeh is an important factor in the finance of the State. 3. When Captain Alban therefore suggested to me his2 80hein« for a proper aasemiiiaent of the dlatrlote in question, I concurred provided that it could be carried out in ouch a nay that trouble was not created aroongat the tribes con cerned, and further that uhen the aaeesBiaent had been com pleted it should only be ia^oBed on the same tenas: absence of tribal friction. Captain Alban agreed with ray views and proceeded to zoaice the assesaraent. 4. It appear a fron Captain Alban'a report that the aaaeaaracnt has been auccessfully carried out without serious friction. It reiaaina for the aaseaamrnt to be irapoaed under the same conditiona. 5. In effecting the aaaeasraent, the greater part of which waa done under his peraonal aupervision before he left A lb an Muscat for Karachi, Captain^iaa done good work under trying conditions. The hot weather is far frora being an Ideal time for revenue aaseaaraent in uraan, which of courae ia entirely lacking in the azaenitiea of dak bungalows, reat- houaea, and ao forth, which exiat in India.

The year 1932 has 'been an extremely unsettled one rrom a financial point of Tiew. 2. At the close of the financial year 1951, after an unprecedented slump in the prices of commodities it was thouglt that 'bottom had 'been touched and that in the coming year # even if conditions did not improye they would not at least deter iorate much further. 3. On this assumption, therefore, the 'budget estimate o revenue for 1932 was hased on the actual receipts of the prerious year, less Js # 50,000 to offset any other possible drop in receipts. 4. The advent of the year 1932 was awaittod with interest and when the month of January 'brought in receipts exceeding those of the corresponding period for the two preceding years it was hoped that the worst of the depression was passed, yebruary and March while not so good, were at least equal to the prerious year. 5. Mow according to all precedent the next two months of the year i.e. April and May should have heen much more pros perous owing to the arrival from alaroad of country craft laden with imports from their last voyage Defore the monsoon. It is in this period also that large quantities of ^ T at:ha i.e. fish j ' manure, we shipped to Indie and Germany. 6. At the heglnnlng of Kprll, however, as a result of adrloes received from Germany, no shlj-ment of Kasha took place to that country. The result of this was an Immediate and heavy slump In the market for this article while shipments for Bomha and southern India also declined. 7. K heavy drop in revenue Immediately appeared and the Treasury lost nearly Is. 32,000, as compared with the corres ponding period for the previous year, in the month of April and Ifay,8. It was now olear that if the market maintained this attitude until the end of the year the State, bo far from sho*ng surplus, would he faced with a deficit of any thing upto half a lakh of rupees. comprehensive 9. JL echeme of retronchments and economies was accordingly drawn up, which, in its final form as put up to t^ Hon^le the political Resident, vide Ho. 17/17/681 dated June 13th, 1932, rrom P.A.., Muscat to P.H. secured a reduction in the State expenditure of aT)out te. 50,000. These reductions weie finally 'brought into force on July 1 and incorporated in the revised budget for the later half of the year. 10. xs previously anticipated, the next three months i.e. June, July and August produced some of the poorest revenue figures ever recorded 'but in September, following on improved conditions in Germany and in India, the prices of dates and Kasha 'began to show an upward tendency with the result that figures for the later months of the year have sho^n a very decided improvement over those of the preceding year and it is now certain that the State will have a satisfactory 'balance over Is. 40,000 to carry forward into 1933. II. Retrenchments and economies . 11. The economies effected in 1932 (para 9 above) lay more in the direction of closing down departments not absolutely essential, abolition of superfluous or redandant posts and the cutting down of allowances,rent, ect. except for a few instances no general retrenchment of salaries on a percentage basis was carried out, this ground having been sufficiently covered during the previous year. The only expenditure head which had escaped all but an insignificant cut being the civil list. 12. Previous retrenchments had been as follows Defence. 16 % reduction in sal&amp;ries and re-organisation. Oastoms . 10 % reduction in salaries Other departments 7 i reduction in salaries OiTil Msl' 5 % reduction in allowances for those drawing: Is, 100 per mensem or over.- ■ — JS r wgZ 13. in ad&amp;ition to these genep^ral rtduotions a continuous process of pruning and weeding out superfluous posts and other items of expenditures had 'been going on while new rates of pay at the rate of te. 20 per mensem were introduced for the Sepoys of the Lery Corps in place of the former rate of fe, To illustrate the effect of these rarious ecomomies a comparison between the expenditures of the principal departments in 19^9 and that of the same departments in 1933 as giyen Delov. :- Budget Heads 1929 1933.

In addidtion to this, the adverse trade balance stands at the very high figures of £. 1,49,681 for 1930-31 and £. 1,35,319 for 1931-32, it is, however, encouraging to note that this adverse balance has decreased 'by £.14,362, Ho satisfactory explanation is forthcoming as to where these large amounts are obtained from, practically no export lakes place over the land frontier, and it can only be assumed that these4. these large sums of money constitute expenditure out of capital and saTlngs amassed during the prosperous days of the Arms Traffic and the War, If this is so then the value of imports will continue to decline, even as It is now doing, until It finds its natural level in relation to the exports. 15, The increase or decrease in the value of the principal articles of import in the year 1931-32 as compared with the previous year are shown in the Appendix I attached. A net decrease of Rs. 4,88,190 is shown. In Appendix II will 'be found the corresponding figures for the principal articles of export during the last two years.

During the spring and early summer of this year a compre- out hensive assessment of Zakat was carried/along nearly the whoite Batinah Coast. Out of the nine districts lying 'between Muscat and imrair, seven were assessed in great detail, garden 'by garden and the revenue records thus compiled are the 'basis of the presen year•s demand, previous to this, Zakat had heen imposed on communities and individuals at odd time and under varying circum* stances. There was no regular system and no regular rate of incidence in relation to value of crops or market prices. As a result of this, powerful communities were paying no^aT^sums of Zakat such as 3^. 50 when under the assessment the Zakat on their properties amounted to gT, 2,000 or more. Conversely individuals were found paying as much as is, 100 per the Zakat whose properties were found on assessment to 'be liable to ahout fc. 20 per annum.

Appendix I is a comparative table showing the value of the principal articles of import in the years 1930-31 &amp; 1931-32 together with the net increases or decreases (para 15). 24. Appendix II gives the corresponding export figures for the above two years 25. Appendix III shows the average wholesale prices prevailing in united Kinsdon, Germany and India during previous years and from January to August, 1932. 26. The prices for the year 1931, it will be noted, show a heavy slump compared with those of preceding years (para 2). The prices for January, Tebruary and March, 1932 are even, with a downward tendency (para 4). 27. Beginning from April a further marked drop in prices is apparent in all three countries (paras 5 &amp; 6) and this continues until August when a slight upward movement wai&gt; recordod in the United Kingdom and British India (para 10), 28 # The month of September Bhowniu a further substantial rise in the United Kingdom prices. 29. Referring to part y (para 17) which gives revenue estimates] and receipts for previous years it will be seen that the heaviesbaaTlest drops in rerenue were in 1930,1931 and 1932.

This is in conformity with our experience in Muscat (paras 6 *7). It also agrees with the drop in April prices showni in para 27. 39. July shows a sharp recovery which has continued through'!

In accordance with this, our receipts September onward have shown a decided improvement (para 10). m Appendix III also, this downward tendency is reflected in the prices between April and August (para fc7). 40. m September a general recovery is shown which is continued in October and november (para 28). 41.

British Residency and Consulate-aeneral, Bushire, the eth January 1933. From The Hon'hie Lieut •-Colonel T.G. Fowle, G.B.ii., Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi. Sir, In continuation of my letter No. 599-J of 20th August last, I have tue honoui to enclose copy of a letter No. 17/17/1454 of 20th Becemher 1932 from the Political Agent, Muscat, covering a statement on the proposed budget of the Kuscat State for 1935, and a report on the Muscat State financial year of 1932, prepared by Captain Alban. 2. The present financial condition of the State may he summarised as follows. On its yearly working the State can he said to oe 'ticking over - —if 1 may use this expression. That is to say its yearly revenue is meeting its expenditure, with a balance over, which this year - inclusive of accrued savings of Hs. 29,000 from 1931 - will come to Bs. 40,000 (paragraphs 10 and 21 of the report). /Prima faoia therefore the financial situation is satisfactory, unfortunately, however, there are two factors to oe considered - (a) Debts which come to ils. 1,63,204 (paragraph 19 of report). ('b) Cessation of Arms Subsidy of Us. 1.00,000 in 1935 (vide Government of India Sxpress Letter Ko. 5 , .161*N/32 of 30th June 1932). With regard to (a). These will toe reduced toy utilising the anticipated oalance of Bs. 40,000 (vide paragraph 2 atoove) towards paying off in January 1933 the final instalment, amountinti to Hs. 23,000, of the Crovernment of India loan, and toy the scaling down of the detots due to private creditors (vide paragraph 19 of report)• The surplus balance in the toudget for 1933 presented is ils. 23,750 (paragraph 3 of toudget statement) But half-way through the year, from July 1st, further economies, details of which will toe furnished toy the Sultan, will be enforced which wiljjbring in by the end of the year another &amp;s. 25,000 (paragraph 5 of the toudget statement). The total credit balance at the end of 1933 will therefore toe Bs. 4d,750. Of this sum i\s. 25,000 will be funded, while Bs. 23,750 will presum ably be set aside for paying off debts. 6. It is assumed (paragraph 4 of toudget statement) that the year 1934 will close with a balance of about jas. 74,QUO oud, i.e. ils. 23,750 (similar to the balance for 1933), and Ks. 60,000 the balance acctjrNed from the special economies over a whole year. Of the I\s. 74,000, Rs. 23,750 will presumably toe spent in further liquidatio of the debts, and lis. 50,000 will toe funded, giving a total/- 5 - * total investnient reserve of lis. 75,000 at toe Deginning of 19S5 (paragraph 5 cf budget stateiaent). 7. Karly in 1935 (April j the State will lose the Anus ouoaiay ot &amp;&amp;• 1,00,000, uut exolusive ot the invest flient reserve of Bs. 75,000 (aaauffiing that the working expenditure and revenue for that year will be approximate ly the same as for i932-33-34) will have a balance at the end of the year of about its. 74,000, i.e. approximately Bs. 24,000 (similar to the balance for 1934 j and -vs . 50,000 tiue balance accrued from the special economies over the year, leaving a debit balance of Es. 26,000 to be made up from other sources (paragraph 6 of budget statement)• • 8. There is of course much that is necessarily hypothetical in Captain A1ban's forecast of what the financial situation of the otate will be some three years hence, but as in toat period the atate is faced with the loss of (what to itj is a very large source of revenue, the Arms subsidy, some sort of forecast had to be attempt ed. The principal feature of the budget statement is the institution of the special ecoBomies from 1st July (paragraph 5 of statement). The decision of Kis Highness to introduce these economies half-way through the year instead of now is certainly peculiar, but - from the Sultan's point of view - there is good reason for it. These economies will be ma4e from the Civil List, i.e. cuts in the allowances of the Hoyal family, and by the 1st July His Highness will not be in Muscat to face his disgruntled relatives, as he is proceeding to an outlying and - after the monsoon breaks - inaccessible part of his/his dominions • Dhotar, for tine sumiiier. By the time he returns at tae end of August or so the family storm will have a Dated* His Highness pursued the same tactics last year hy heing absent in India when the economies reported in my letter No. 541 -S of 6th August last were effected. I cannot say that His Highness• tactics are heroic y hut they are doubtless what any peace-loving man would adopt under similar circumstances, more especially since - as His Highness confided once to me in a moment of confidence - it is the women folk amongst his relatives that he especially fears. His mother indeed, wife of the ex-Sultan 3aiyid Taimur, is a most formidable old lady, and I have a suspicion that Saiyid Taimur*s abdication was perhaps as much due to his desire to get away from her as from Muscat and its responsibilities. The idea of the investment reserve to De built up by the special economies is sound enough in itself, provided that His Highness stands firm by these economies being actually made from the Civil List, and not from the general administration which - as Captain Alban points out (paragraph 6 of the Budget Statement) has already been cut to the bone. I will procure from His HighnesSf before he goes into his summer retreat, details of the proposed economies. Captain Alban's report on the Muscat State financial year 1932 contains much interesting matter which it must have taken much labout to collect. The 193S budget itself seems to me to meet the exigencies of the financial situation, and should - I suggest - be given our official approval. Doubtless there are details in it at which a financial purist might cavil, but I venture to quote the con cluding sentence of my report (written as PoliticalAgent, Muscatj on the finances of the Muscat State, No. 0-238 of 10th December 1931, which I think contains the principles by which we might be guided in viewing the affairs of that State (as indeed theaffairs of the other Arab states of the Persian Gulf), political as well as financial: 'We are not dealing with a part of British India, we are not even dealing with an Indian State, our concern is with an independent Arabian Sultanate whose stability for various reasons, political and strategical, is important to us, but in whose affairs we want to interfere as little as possible provided that this stability is assured I have the honour to be.

A»( ' 'tiiOROi 1 Your lelegrarn Ko.72 of 27th January 1933. 1 forward herewith the Financial Adviser* s comments on the proposals made by His Highness. The opening credit balance for 1932 was Rs.71,06^-15 from which a sum cf Hs.46,30 9-4 of public debt has been repaid leaving a balance of Rs.24,760-11. The actual working credit receipts in 1932 were Rs.15,981/— I.e. Rs.6,68,981 revenue, Rs.6,53,000 expenditure ( vide statement accompanying my Fo.17/17/43 dated 10-1-33) which amount added to the balance in the foregoing ^ra totals some Rs. 40,000/-. This iigare represents the estimated opening balance for 1953. The actual balance is however Rs.93,491 ( of which some Rs.21,000 has since been ^aid out in January in lequidation of the last instalment of Government of India loan) . Thus the actual opening balance for 1933 exceeds the estimated one by roughly Rs.50,000. 1 therefore agree with khe Financial Adviser's comments subject to the proviso that the Sultan must promise to a^ain ^ review the situation in December 1934 - as advocated by the Financial Adviser. I have no other comments to offer. i /' - Major, Political A^ent &amp; H,B,k' s Gonsu 1, i.uecat.No. C-45 of 1933. Office of the Political Beeiaent in the Pereian Gulf.

(b) lle^.oranduLx of Instructions to the Officiating Goimi-andant, I. use at Infantry. (c) A covering letter to the Sultan. These contain all tne arrangements for carrying on routine worcc during i-v absence. 2# I am taking the precaution of depositing copies of the above in the Agency, Muscat as the ouitan has, of late, evinced a most undesirable tendency to 'Lon.cey about' with the finances and with tne l/edical arrangement of the Levy Corps 3. Last year when I was acting as political Agent, he suddenly wrote a most peremptory letter to Dhuii Ghand telling him to nand over tne whole Finance Office to the Council; hazily I heard about it, ana was aole to send for the Council and squash the matter which I neea hardly say would have upset the whole State. u, 4. Later in tne sa^e year he sudaeniy ..rote me^somewhat peremptory letter the effect of .nich would have been to tai.ee away my control of the finances completely. Amongst other things I as limited to expending not LiO re than xis.ibO/- per annum out of the Budget without his sanction. When I us ;ed for an explanation he hastily assured me that he hadn't meant anything at all by it. Txie letter, which I ignored, is, however, with me and tne intei-tiou is unuiistateable. 5 The Hon'ble Lieut.Colonel T.O.j'owie, G.B.I.., political Resident in tne pex-sian G i-f, 3 U o H I H E.5. Last summer, while I .vas away, the Sultan started a motor car registration tax which he x jut in cliar^e oi' Is. -ail Effendi, a very anti British Palestinian young man and ex- headrnaster of the school whom, he is seeding on privately as tutor to his young brother. They nettled about ^s.lOOO from this and embezzled the money which I have been pressing for ever since. Incidentally when I wrote to Isu^il on the Sultan's suggest ion I merely recelvea an impertinent re^ly which, I fancy. Hi s Highness connived at. I intend, however, to have ti.e money when I return. On the Sultan's departure I too^ over collection oi this tax. 6. I find that ail the expenses of the tri^ to Dhofar and rations for 6 months for the whole party halL&lt;been charged to the State, although Dhofar ^ays no revenue to the State. A Customs house has also been set up there which taires duty on the whole cargo of ail boats touching tnero on the way to Muscat, the result being that cargoes are landed here with a duty paid pass from Dhofar Customs. 7. Before the Sultan left I told him that the arrangement which he had made last year whereby Dr.Ghei of Fattrah should look after the Levy Corps was a failure and that I proposed to dismiss Ghei and arrange with the Agency Surgeon as before,to which he said notning. When I carried out the ^reposed arrangement the other aay, the Council came to me in perplexity and snowed me a private letter from the Sultan to them telling them that the Levy Cor^s must not be attended to by the Agency Surgeon. I told them that this was entirely my affair and that I would explain the matter to the Sultan. ^. He also o^/es the j^evy Oor^s ^ii.ore than Hs. 1500,/— for inles issuca to him, ne is al'..L.vys ^roniis^ing to order soi o more to replace these, a thing he has, however, no intention of doing. I am doing it for him now. 9.

One memorandum ib adaroayce. to m^ Aaaietant in the Finanee Department and on4 to the offieiating Commandant, miaeat Infantry# 3. These inatruetiona contain all neeeaaary information te enable the two aub-ordinate officials in question i«e» R.S.Dull Chand antl Subadar Kajor to carry on the routine cf work exactly as I have left it. 4. Should you,therefore,have any auggeationa to make which in any way concern the Finance Department 1 shall be grateful if you will keep them for diacuaaion with me en my return,during which time business will continue as usual according te routine. 5. T umlerBteod from the Council that Yeur Highness has &gt; written 4hem a letter from Phofar containing fiurther ins tructions to them regarding the engagement of a new Doctor for ?*uttrah Diapensary and the for the Levy Corps. Aa I informed you before your departure for Ihcfar the arrangement whereby the State Medical Jfficcr iu t-uttrch was put in charge of the Bait-al -FaiaJ medical ai 'rangeiients was highly unsatisfactory. I have, therefore!,come to nn arrangement with the Agency Surge on, Muse at on the same linos ats previously. I am not prepared to cenkiider any change in thin for a coniilderable tiicm to come. 6. With regurt. to engaging a new Medical Officer, I am sure you will agre*j that tbo engagement of cheap Doctors isboth undesirable and dangerouB* I am quite aware that people calling themselves Doctors and in poscesBion ol some sort certifieates cm be obtained for Bs •80 or Rs *60 per no nth even If you eonsider It nedessary to engage u new Doctor a budget provision for Rs .600 per month will have to be allott ed for hip, ealary. T em , doubtful,bowevcr, if any reliable Doctor would come for such a salary. If this Doctor were to be in charge of tho Levy ccrp&lt;3 wedlonl nr 'Cin^ezaenta I should hove to in .i1.fi t upon the provision of v proper hospital ,auch as ITasib• b house in ^uttroh, fully equipped with furniture,beds # medicines,eto. The cost of this wlii probably be about Rs .3000 Tf a new Doctor, therefore .wera to bo engaged it nould bii neooseary to bu^^et for about 2:. .10,000 during the f: : rBt year and in view of this fact 1 considax that the matter should be postpond until my return when we can diseues it. 7, With regard to the list of economies these have been duly annoanoea by the Council and will come in forces on July 1 as agreed: I hove,however,left unchanged the pay of compounder Thomas as I find that his pay has already been reduced from Es .195 to Rs .100 i.e. reduction of 48 f which I think is a bigger reduction than any one else hos had, especially considering his 12 years good service with the Levy Corps. 8. Levy C orp s,., With regard to the Levy Cor^s there is nothing which ealls for comment except the following:- 1. Certain increments of pay have been given to Indian Officers as per para 5 of the instrudtions to the Officiating Commandant. These increments and allow ances are admissable for the extra duties performed by the recipients. 2. With regard to rifles I find that we have altogether ordered 60 Short rifles in the pe8t;fut of these 15 have been issued to you at various times and I under stand that Your Highness has now asked for 3 morebringing th« total issue upto 18 while the number left with the Levy Corps is only A2. The arrange ment wo8,you will remember,that these rifles taken by you will be replaced. I am,therefore,ordering 18 rifles from Indio to replace the ones issued to you. The eost of these,about lis .1500, its of course debit- able to you. There are t.lao tii.'ill i,iLountB due on nceount of 24 ptiirs of ehttplies, eta # which you have ordered. Police.

IT. E« rMuscat Budget 19.35 . Note. In brief the situation with regard to the finances of the Muscat State is that the State on its yearly Expenditure and Revenue is 'ticking over'. 2. The balance for 1932 inclusive of accrued savings from previous year # is estimated to be Rs 40,000 (paras 10 and 2 of Report). 3. Prima facieXth? financial situation is satisfactory. Unfortunately, however, there are two factors to be considered (a) Debts which come to Ps 1,53,204 (para 19 of report) (b) Ce ssation of Arms Subsidy of ■3 Cessation of Arms Sut^sid Rs 1,00,000 in 1935. 4. With regard to (a) these will be fu^jttfer reduced by utlizing the anti cipated balance of Rs 40,000 -fvide para &lt;i above) towards paying off in January 1933 the final instalment, amounting to Rs 23,000, of the Government of India loan, and^the scaling down of the aebts due to private creditors (vide para 19 of Report). The surplus balances anticipated tor tht years 1933 and 1934 &gt;&gt; ^jn^^ : ?similarly us. d kr paying off the debts. With regard to (b). Supposing the working of 1933 is as estimated / the surplus will be Es 23,7b0 (say Rs 24,000) • vide para 3 of ^ jo timette 1933. This surplus will be utilized for the pay ment of debts (vide para 4 (a) above) . But in the latter half of 1933 it is proposed to effect special economies in the Civil List which will bring in a saving of Rs 25,000 (para 5 of Estimate)This saving will be funded. Assuining the working of 1934 to be the same as that of 1933 there will be a similar Surplus of Rs 24,000 which will go towards the liquidation of the States debts, and the special economieg in tue Civil List initiated in the second half of 1933 will in 1934 yield a. saving of Rs 50,000. This saving will again De funded making the total sum funded Rs 75,000. .estimating the working of 1935 to be again the same as the previous two years, the surplus of Es 24,000 and the saving of Es 50,000 from the Civil List i.e. a total Rs 74,000 will go as a set off against the loss of the subsidy of Rs 1,00,000 leaving a deficit of Rs 26,000. This deficit which will be slightly reduced by the interest of the funded amount of Rs 75,000, will have to be met somehow. There will thus be no provision for the payment of debts after 1935. 5. The fund will be a reserve which can be used either to meet the gradual liquidation ol debts or to maice good the deiicit on the working of a bad year.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001a6_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/449</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001a6</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/449</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘File 35/137 II (A 61) Muscat state budget’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1932/1933</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-09-18T15:12:28</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (184 folios)</extent><extent>The volume’s contents are arranged in chronological order, from the earliest item at the front to the latest at the end.

All of the statements were submitted to the Residency by the Political Agency in Muscat, having been initially prepared by the Financial Adviser to the Muscat State (Captain Reginald Alban) and his assistant (Malik Duli Chand).Subjects of note in the volume include:A copy of the annual budget for the Muscat State for 1933, including: a review of the previous year, described by the Financial Adviser as ‘extremely unsettled’, chiefly as a result of a drop in global demand for Muscati exports, and details of the Muscat civil list (folios 60-98);Proposals from the Sultan of Muscat, Saiyid Said bin Taimur [Sa‘īd ibn Taymūr], on how the Muscat Government will address the shortfall in income (100,000 rupees) anticipated when the Arms Traffic Subsidy ceases in 1935 (folios 107-17);Copies of letters sent by Alban in his capacity as Financial Adviser, to his assistant, the Officiating Commandant of the Muscat infantry, and to the Sultan, with instructions for arrangements relating to the financial department during his absence from Muscat. Alban’s instructions chiefly address the prospect of interference in the Muscat finances by the Sultan (folios 148-59).The volume covers a period in which there were multiple changes of personnel in the Gulf, as a result of the sudden death of the Political Resident, Sir Hugh Biscoe, in July 1932. After Biscoe’s death, the Political Agent in Muscat (Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Fowle) became Political Resident, and the Financial Adviser to the Muscat State (Alban) became the Political Agent in Muscat.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Financial Advisor to the Sultan of Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Financial administration</topic></subject><subject><topic>State budget</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001a6#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
