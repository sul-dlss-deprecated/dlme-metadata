In particular, the papers discuss the extension of the railway from Baghdad to Basra, and possibly its extension to the Persian Gulf at Shatt-al-Arab waterway. A significant portion of the papers relate to the financial arrangements governing the incorporation of the Imperial Baghdad Railway Company, which was also responsible for the governance of the railway and any possible extensions.However, the majority of the papers express British concerns on German encroachment towards the Persian Gulf, and by extension, towards British interests in South Asia. The papers reveal the British strategy of containing German influence by dictating the composition of the railway company's board.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Baghdad Railway Company</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Political crises</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Basra</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Baghdad</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Business records</topic></subject><subject><topic>Railways</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000126#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000126#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000126#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
