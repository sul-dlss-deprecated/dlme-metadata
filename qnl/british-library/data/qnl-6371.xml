Brief for Stcretary of State* ^ *1*1 ^ o^Ajt Aden has been an important entrepftt of trade since early times • at any rate since the early centuries of Islam* In 1513 it was attacked unsuccessfully by Albuquerque* In 1536 it was acquired by the Turks as a base of operations against the Portuguese, and belonged to them until 1630, when it passed back to the possession of the Imam of the Yemen. Subsequently it was possessed by Tarious Arab Chiefs until 1839, when it was captured by the British with a force of 300 European and 400 Indian troops* The occasion of its capture was an outrage (r U K *1 V O W on the passengers ^nd crew of a British j : sif— wrecked in the neighbourhood* The dSast India Company, however, had already in 1839 contemplated making it a coaling station, but «t that time had abandoned the idea, owing to the difficulty of procuring labour* Perim, which now forms part of the Aden Settlement, had been occupied by the British in 1799 as a precaution against the possible descent of Hapoleon on India, but was subsequently abandoned till 1857 when it was re*occupied* It will thus be seen (a) that Aden has always been a place of general strategic importance, and (b) that historically as well as geographically it is an Arab town* The assertion made in the Indian Legislature thnt Aden is the creation of Indian commercial enterprise has to be heavily discounted. 2* The populntion of the Aden Settlement (excluding Ferim, which has a population of 1,700) at/TKecent hjgtory of queBtion of transfT« at the 1931 o( follows: Arabs 29,820 Indians 7,287 Jews 4,120 Somali a 3,936 Suropeana 1,145 Miscellaneous 331 Total 46,638 Thus about 64 per cent ef the population la Arab as against about 15 per cent Indian* The total area of the aettlement is 75 square miles and of Perim 5 square miles. 3. Many speakers in the Legislature went through the history of the Tarious recent steps taken in regard to Aden, and sought to give the impression that H.ll.G. had intentionally led up to the present proposal by a series of faits fecco n plls* In order, therefore, to correct false impressions, it might be desirable for the Secretary of State when he speaks to the Indian Delegates and the Joint Select Committee, to give a short resume of the recent history of the nueation leading up to the preaent position somewhat as follows:* (i) The political and military administration has been controlled by His Majesty^ OoTernment since 1917, when it was taken OTer as a war measure. A prolonged controversy as to thi financial and administratiYe responsibility for Aden followed the war and was finally settled by the Cabinet decision ofA - r\ December 1926 on a basis financially far more farourable to India than previous proposals made by the Colonial Office; the civil (i.e. internal municipal) administration of the Settlement was left with India, and the political control (i.e. sole responsibility for the Protectorate) and military control with H.M.O.^who took over the military and political charges with the aid of an annual contribution from Indian revenues (of £250,000 a year for the first three years, and after that one*third of the total annual cost, subject to a maximum of £150,000 a year). Indian present liability under thie head is about £120,000, but as Sir George Schuster pointed out in the Assembly, it might at any time rise to £150,000. Pledges have been given by the Government of Indie from time to time that the civil administration will not be transferred to His Majesty's Government without the Legislature and the interests concerned being given an opportunity of expreesing their views. In 1931 it was decided, ae a measure of admlnistmtive convenience, to transfer the adminietration from the Government of Bombay to the Government of India, and this transfer was made with effect/effect from let April 1932. In Hovember 1931 Lord Wlllin^don and Sir .S.Howell stated to a deputation that this change did not affect the question of transfer to the Colonial Office and was not a step towards any other change. That statement was true; there was no arri^re pens^e in the decision taken in 1931: it was taken simply as a matter of administrative convenience; if it had not been taken, the constitutional question which has now arisen would hare had to be considered none the less. (ii) Until progress had been made with consideration of the present proposals for Indian constitutional reform, no question arose of rerising the decision of 1926 regarding Aden. But as the proposals for an almost atttonomous Indian Federation took clearer shape, it became obvious that the question of Aden would have again to be considered with a view to deciding whether the continuance of the existing arrangements would be practicable when the Government of India is converted into an autonomous Federal Government. Hence the statement in the White Paper that the future arrangements for the Aden Settlement are under consideration. On 30th May the Secretaiy of State received a deputation led by the Aga Khan, of which Sir P. Sethna was spokesman. He noted the views of the deputation and gave them the assurance that no decision would be taken before discuss!on /6 © diseunsion In the Indian Legislature» and furthermore that, whnterer the decision might be, every care would be taken to safeguard existing interests so far as it lay in the power of His Majesty's Government to do so. At the same time he suggested to the deputation, as matter for reflection, the difficulties of fitting Aden into an Indian Federation, /'it would be as well to recall this, because Sir P.Sethns in the Council of State and speakers in the Legislative Assembly misinterpreted the Secretary of Stated strictly non-committal wttitude as one of sympathy with the deputation, and attributed to him a statement that the difficulty of fitting Aden into the Federation was not insurmountable^ (iii) Subsequently» in order that the question might be discussed by the Legislature and considered by the interests ooneerned with a full knowledge of the facts. His Majesty's Government authorised the oommuniqutf of 19th June, stating the considerations which suggest the desirability of the transfer of Aden and the very generous conditions ?nd assurances which His Majesty^ Government are prepared to give if transfer takes place. Since then opportunity has been given, as promised, for full discussion in both Chsmbers of the Indian Legislature end steps have been taken to elicit the wishes of the Arab population of Aden itself. iir)/6. /-N Imperlnl interegts Difficulty of plicin^ cxTiX inlBtrati on under j-ndinri Federal Oovt. (1y) Thus the matter is now nearly ripe I for a decision. The Secretary of State has carefully studied the debates in the Legislature and has giren due weight to the views expressed therein, but he has aleo had to consider most anxiously the whole question in the li^ht of all the facts, the rarious and extensiTe interests involTed, and the views expressed in Tflrious quarters* 4. The following points might be mentioned. The strategic position of Aden and its importance from this point of riew to the Empire in the ^ast generally »nd not merely to any single unit, is a strong argument for control by the Home OoTernroent. This by itself might well be considered by Parliwnent here as a decisire objection to the retention of the existing condwniniura when once the new constitution is established in India. Aden, besides its importance to the Smpire as a refuelling station, is in fact of greiter general strategic importance to Imperial communications and to the i £mpire as a whole than to India by itself; moreorer, Aden (Settlement plus Protectorate, which for this purpose are an integral whole) is of political importance with regard to Arabia. 5. The debates in the Legislature indicate that (owing perhaps partly to the omission of the Government of India to give any guidance) members failed to realise the true nature of the difficulties of fitting Aden into an Indian Federation. The only difficulty mentioned in the debates was the fact that Aden is now a Chief Commissioners province directly under the O.of I., and members naturally asked why this difficulty could not be met by returning Aden to the Govt, of Bombay and making it again part of the//'&gt; •' the Bombay Prceldcncy. They even ineinuatea that Aden had bean taken away from Bombay lor the p^poae or creating this very difficulty. The Secretary of State will therefore, no doubt, wiah to explain more fully the reasons for the statements in the coiiiianni^ ox 19th June that Aden M would not naturally fit into the new Federation, that it is already to some extent under Imperial control and that it is inseparable in practice from the Aden Protectorate, which has already passed wholly out of Indian control** The real points which were missed in the Legislature appear to je as follows:- It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to make a clean separation between the Arab town oi Aden and its Arab hinterland, the Aden Protectorate# jjinilarly, it would j * impracticable to effect a complete divorce between the civil administration of the Settlement on the one hand and the political and military control of the Settlement and the Protectorate on the other* For many purposes the whole area forms a simple whole* At present there is a condominium, the civil administration of the Settlenmnt being controlled xrom Delhi, the political control of the Protectorate and the defence of both bein^ placed directly under His Majesty's Government* Naturally there are very great practical alfricaltieti involved in a condominium of this charactex The only reason why it works efficiently ir praotloe/CD practice at all la that in the last reacrt the declaion of all queations arising Testa in iiia Majesty^ Governiaent. Thia is eo because the Ocvernment ol' India under its pie&amp;ent constitution is in the last resort suborUinate to His Majesty's Oovernment.But when the OoYernffient of India beooites an autonomous GoTernmentt the position will be entirely different, and the division of eontrolf which is just worfcahle at present, would become entirely unworkable•Furthermae for defence purposes it is obriously impossible to make a distinction between the Protectorate and the Settlement, and it is therefore essential that the defence of the latter as well as of the former should continue to be a direct responsibility of His Majesty's (Government. But a continuance of the present system, whereby delence vests in liis Majesty's Ooveinment in resp «ot of the Settlement as well as of the Protectorate, would become constitutionally anomalous if the Settlement became part of an autonomous Inaian Federation* It is ' felt that such a constitutional anomaly would be difficult to defend against criticism in the indian Federal Legislature, and. might lead to a not illogical demand for the retransfer of the military control to India* The Secretary of State might go onto point out that one of the most important factors to be considered is the interests of the Arab majority* In the Legislature reference was made to resolutions against transfer V-1 \ purporting/purporting to represent the views ol tne Arabs as weii as of tne Indians* 'Die Secretary ot State xuight say that since the issue of the conimuniaue of i9th June # the object of which was to elicit Arab as well as Inoian opinion, he has been at pains to obtain Xrom the Chief Coninissioner a report on the real wishes of the Arabs, The Chief Comnissioner reports tnat the J rab comtainity view with grave misgivings the possibility that the Government of Aden may become Inaianiaea as the result of constitutional changes in India, and fear the subordination of Arab to Indian interests: tne Arabs are as a whole satisfied with the existing state of affairs (i.e., with an administration controlled through the Government of Inaia by His majesty's Government); but t since a continuance of the present state of affairs will in any case be made impossible by tne forthcoming Indian Reforms, they would prefer that the administration of Aden £iiould henceforth be controlled by ais ^-ajesty's Government direct, moreover, it would hardly be in accord with the principle of self-determination that Aden should be brought under an Indian Federal Government and Legislature; the itrab community coula not be effectively represented in tne inaian i-egislature at Delhi and, especially in the absence of such effective representation, it would be too much to expect that when conflicts arose between Arab and Indian interests the foriiier would always receive the consideration which tney deserved. . racial 7. sir P. sethna ana other speakers laid great stress on their fear tuat under Crown Joiony Govsrmiient Inulans would suffer from racial discriiuinatlon.

FVom a n«morial to the Viooroy of which we ha*o &amp; copy it spoears t'at lir H, Dinsltav'o fearts are partly based on tho srit]cipatioB that Aden's trade with India ^snerally, and tho salt Industry in particular, «ould suffw from tho Indian iraport tariff. There my bo aotne 'J; stance/«ub«tence in this anticipation as rep&amp;rdn salt {«©© Velow), (2) There ifl t however, a different ^ point involved in Sir P.Setbna^ compsris on with Somaliland. The allegation is that traders (Indiana i Jews and Arabs alike) have left the ooraaliland ports owing to high taxation resulting from costly administration. But as a matter of fact there is no basis for the comoarison. It is understood from Colonel Reilly that the reason why the Somaliland ports have ppne down is that the Somaliland Administration owin^ to the unruly character of the inhabitants, is totally unable to levy any direct taxation, and consequently depends entirely on import duties; the position at Aden is exactly the reverse, as Aden is a free oort and the cost of the administration is net by direct taxation, fff.SCt of 10. Indian salt firms at Aden fear that their rmvtvr on Ad m interests would be adversely affected by transfer. The position is that salt made in Aden is at present exempt from the additional import duty in India imposed by the Salt (Additional Import Duty) Act of I931 t and accordingly shares with salt made in India the advantape of a preference over other 'foreign* salt of 2i annas a inaund. (The duty on foreign imported salt was reduced this yoar from 41- annas to annas per maund). If Aden ceased to be part of India and no concession were made to Aden salt, it would lose this preference. This is not a matter in which the Secretary of State could interfere as he is precluded by the Fiscal Convention. The Government/Government of India have etatod (in a talsgraxn of 5lst Au^st) that # if Aden i» separated, it will be for the Indian Legislature of the future to decide what terms should be accorded to salt from Aden. The Governnent of India have also nsade it pretty clear (in a letter of 13th February) that they foresee little chance of favourable treatrtient of Aden salt by the Indian Legislature, and are quite definite in their view that there would be no case, failing such special treatment, for compensation or assistance o p the Aden salt industry at the esmense of Indian revenues. Apparently all thai the Secretary of ^tate could say on the subject of salt would be to recall that in the recent debates in the Legislature great solicitude was sho«m for the commercial and other interests of Indianeat Aden, and to hope that this may indicate some chance that the Indian Legislature may not be unresponsive to any appeal on behalf o^ the Indian salt manufacturers at Aden t&gt;at may be made by Sir P t Sethm and his friends vheri the question arises. 11. Sir P. Sethna^s speech and the other speeches in the Legislature showed that there were misconceptions (genuine or deliberate) regarding the generous oonditioxui contemplated by rT is I.'ajesty*® Government in the camfflinuS of 19th June in the event of transfer. Those repjarding the contribution ano the promise that there would be no racial discrimination have been dealt with above. As regards assurance No.2 that a right of appeal would co- tinua to lie to the loraibay Hi^h Court, several speakers poured scorn on this, as if it were intended/e 14. Inianctad at a aop to BodNqr* reality, of course, it vas included a: on( tho aaaur^cea in the interesto of Aden liti^its, 'bsrt unfair &gt;lay was alscj a-le in ih i dobata« witV • &gt; qualifiad form of assurance# 3 (smlnton^nce of the free port) and 4 {r^intenance of the prtmnt standard of administration without impetiag additional taxation) • As regards 6 f the ^oretary of State might t)nphasiae # what is stated In the assurance, that from the point of view of 'is Majesty 1 # Govermfsent themselves the el&gt;andoi%nent of the policy of a free port would clearly in existing economic conditions be financially urnoun* , nince the prosperity of Aden depends lar isly on its transit trade.

JLarola* wording' of assurance ho#5 # A proportion of Indian service administrative t&gt;ersormel -sould be retained in Aden service for sorae years after transfer took place* was entirely misunderstood # The laeanin^ ms 9 of course, t at a proportion o the adsdlni 'tration personnel at Mm «ould continue to belong to the Indian/Indian Service for some years. In the Legislature debates it was twisted to mean that only a proportion of the Indians at present serving arron^ the administrative personnel would be retained for some years, and that the reminder would be ^sent away'. The Colonial Office have now made rnore explicit the meaning of this assurance. They would be prepared to ive an assurance that, in the event of the transfer of Aden, all Indian administrative personnel serving in Aden at the tirae of transfer would be retained on the terras of service under which they were then serving, subject only to modification by mutual consent; when vacancies occurred, Indians would regain eli iMe for appointnent^ (tbourh W ere would be a gradual substitution of Colonial service officers) j^it would be understood that all newcomers to the Aden Service would be appointed on definite terms to be agreed upon in each case, and would have no claim to Indian conditions of service, unless these were specially inDorted into their agreements or letters of appointment. The Colonial Office now give a specific additional assurance that in the event of transfer Indian British subjects would be allowed to enter the Protectorate under precisely the mm conditions as any other British subjects.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000018_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B462</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000018</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B462</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Aden.
