The Department of Overseas Trade have now sent us additional information. Loch referred to the Golden Valley Company. The Department of Overseas Trade state, however, that the industrial importance of gypsum and red oxide is very different. Red oxide is an essential constituent of most lead paints and the finest variety of it exists only in the Persian Gulf. Gypsum, on the other hand, is available in large quantities in different parts of the world. It is in fact produced in the United Kingdom to a considerable extent and any supplementary imports are obtained from comparatively near countries such as Prance, Latvia and Italy. The question whether an import from abroad would be a paying proposition probably depends upon the amount of freight, and it is therefore improbable that/2 V • that imports from the Persian Gulf into the United Kingdom would pay. The only other large market within reach of the Gulf would probably be India, but India apparently also mines gypsum herself and therefore there is likely to be little demand in that country. It would accordingly seem inadvisable if only on commercial grounds, to encourage a British firm to interest itself in gypsum concessions in the Gulf. Strick &amp; Company have not, as yet, approached the Department* of Overseas Trade, and if they should do so the latter do not propose to give them any more than perfunctory encouragement• Vour*s f 1 r ($gd.)

New Telephone No.: WHITEHALL 9040 TELEPHONE DEPARTMENT OF OVERSEAS TRADE, , £8867/35 35 , OLD QUEEN STREET, S.W. 1, 19th December , 193 5, Many thanks for your letter P. 3*8708/35 of December 9th about gypsum in the Persian Gulf. Up to the present, P.O.Strick &amp; Co. have not approached us on this subject. Our views in the matter are as follows . Gypsum is produced in the United Kingdom to a considerable extent, and such supplementary imports as may he necessary are obtained from comparatively near countries such as Prance, Latvia and Italy. Whether or not an import from abroad would be a paying proposition probably depends upon the amount of freight and it is improbably, in the opinion of those likely to know, that imports from the Persian Gulf into the United Kingdom would, in fact, pay. M.C.Clauson Esq.,I mmmmmmmmmmamm &amp; . 0) -E- (b) The only other large market we know of near the Persian Gulf is India. We are told that India herself mines gypsum and, although there are small imports of special qualities, there is likely to he little demand for gypsum in that country. (o) The Treasury do not like us indicating - or, at any rate, advocating - the investment of British capital in specific enterprises abroad. I do not think that this question of principle has ever been raised definitely with regard to the very different shades of sovreignty enjoyed by His Majesty’s Government in various terri tories in the Persian Gulf, but I think that they would still, on the whole, object to our positively encouraging a British interest to take up a property there^mainly for political reasons. (d) Apart from P.G.Strick 8c Co., the only group which we know who have any practical experience of minerals in the Persian Gulf (apart from the Golden ...6/ IS LLe^Sjif ' A fro ' ■ A P -3- Golden Valley oxide people) are the mineral interests centred round Mr.B.W.Janson* He, in turn, is associated with the mining interests which have grouped themselves round Sir Edmund Davis. Though we ourselves have never succeeded in finding out anything actively to the discredit either of Janson or of Davis, the fact remains that Davis is unpopular in the Oity and Janson is apparently disliked by the Foreign Office /i o because of the goings on of Major Holmes who acted, as you are, of course, aware, as his re presentative in the Bahrain Islands. Quite apart, however, from the controversy which for so many years has raged upon the standing of these individuals, there is the practical fact that Jansen*s last effort in the Persian Gulf showed that he was prepared, in the last resort, to sell to the Americans. He may, I think, there fore be ruled out if the whole object of the pro posal at present under review is to prevent American or any other intrusion on to this particular *Tom Tiddler*s ground*. 3 • • •.a -4- 3. We therefore propose to do nobbing in this matter until we are approached by F.G.Striok &amp; Go. If they d£ approach us, we should, in the words of Baggallay, (to wjiom lam sending a copy of this letter) 11 do no more than give tint firm perfunctory ment”• I might perhaps add that the relative importance of gypsum and red oxide is very different. Red oxide is an essential constituent for most lead paints and the finest varieties of it only exist in the Persian Gulf. Gypsum, on the other hand, is available in large quan tities in many different places of the world. LI Dear Glauson, Many thanks for your letter P.2.8708/35 of t lie 9th December about the Political Resident in the Gulf. We will look into the matter and write to you again as soon as possible. f f cua~L\ M.J. Clauson Esq.,&amp; FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l 3rd December, 1935 (E 6610/6221/65) \v&lt; My dear Clauson, I have been asked to reply to your letter P.Z.7397/35 of 6th November to Ward about gypsum concessions in the Persian Gulf, as its interest for us is mainly 'Persia''. Our views can, I think, be expressed in the four following propositions:- (1) There is no reason why any British firm v/hich wishes to exploit gypsum deposits in Persia should not try to do so provided it abstains, both then and thereafter, from all similar activities in Arab territory, or at any rate in such parts of Arab territory .as are claimed by Persia; but that as the main object of Loch's proposals is presumably to forestall the establishment of American and other foreign enterprises in Arab rather than in Persian territory, there would be no point in our suggesting to any British firm that it should interest itself in the Persian deposits. (2) / M. J. Clauson, Esq.A (2) There is in principle no reason why any British firm v/hich is, and remains, free from commitments in Persia should not obtain and operate a gypsum concession on Abu Musa, in the same way that the Golden Valley Ochre Company operates the red oxide concession on that island; but looking at the matter from our own point of view we should much prefer that no British firm should be asked to explore the possibility of doing so or given more than perfunctory encouragement if it raises the question of its own accord* The result would only be another tiring and unprofitable wrangle with the Persians, and the element of uncertainty in the legal position of Tarntr and Abu Musa is just sufficient to make it undesirable to provoke such wrangles gratuitously. Naturally, if there were clear indications that a foreign company had its eye on Abu Musa and we felt that it would be unfair to forbid the Sheikh to grant the concession without providing an alternative concessionaire, the position would have to be reconsidered, (3) There is no reason v/hy any British firm which is and remains free from commitments in Persia should/should not be urged to seek a concession to exploit the deposits in Bahrain, where our policy is firmly to disregard the Persian claim. (4) There is no reason why any suitable British firm should not be urged to exploit the deposits on Halul island or in other Arab territory not claimed by Persia. We agree that it would be worth while consulting the Department of Overseas Trade.INDEXED • Confident ial* GOVERNMENT OP INDIA, Department. l: [N.B ,—This is an ORIGINAL MESSAGE, sent by post to save telegraphic expense and undue use of the wires, but intended to be treated, on receipt, with the same expedition as if it had been telegraphed.

British Residency &amp; Consulate-General, Bushire, 19th September 1935. Deer Sirs, fill you kindly refer to your letter dated the 17th August 1935 in which you make certain enquiries about the existence of gypsum in the Persian Gulf. 2. I am not at present able to answer the detailed enquiries which you make, though I know that gypsum is widely distributed and have myself seen it in a number of places when on tour. 3. X am making enquiries in the matter, but in the meantime I think that it would be useful if your London Principals would get into touch with the Department of Overseas Trade, with whom 1 am in communication on this subject. Yours faithfully, sd. G.Loch, Lieut.-Colonel • Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. To Messrs. F.C.Strick &amp; Co.Ltd., Basrah.3. / Gypsum in the Persian Gulf . In Persia and in the Persian Gulf, gypsum is used as a cementing material. Its softness prevents its being used as a paving material, but it is widely used in the manufacture of plaster board for the lining of houses and such purposes. It can also be utilised for the manufacture of plaster of Paris or as a surface dressing in agriculture. 2. It is to be found in large quantities throughout the Persian Gulf. There are considerable quantities of rock gypsum along the Persian coast:in the Pars series, especially in the neighbourhood of JNaband and also between Lingah and Bandar Abbas. It is also to be found in the Hormuz Islands, though here it has got mixed with other substances and as a result would be more difficult to extract. There are, however, valuable deposits at Bu Musa and Halul. A somewhat impure form known as earthy gypsum is found in the Hormuz Islands and Bahrein. At the latter place the deposit is sufficiently deep and sufficiently pure to be useful.•• 3. The more valuable deposits are undoubtedly within Persian territory and presumably the present proposal to interest a British firm in the exploitation of gypsum is not intended to include (A* ou vA. these Persian deposits. It wrU. appear however from the information above, which is based upon Pilgrim’s X report, that valuable concessions might be obtained in Bu Musa, Halul or Bahrein. 4. Stride &amp; Company, who are apparently interested in the scheme, are a well-known British firm. The Company was founded in 1923 to carry on U u the merchant,business of Strick, Scott and Company, Ltd., \J who had been the distributing agency for the A.P.O.C. and who at that date went into voluntary liquidation. They are interested in the extraction of red oxide from the Persian island of Hormuz, and held a concession at Bu Musa from 1923 to 1928 for the same purpose.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00019f_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3847</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00019f</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3847</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/118 'Gypsum deposits in the Persian Gulf.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1935/1945</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-07-24T22:29:37</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (21 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 23; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.

Gypsum was used as a cementing material and for the manufacture of plaster board. The main deposits were along the coast of Iran (referred to throughout as Persia), but the substance was also more widely distributed in the region.The issue is discussed by British officials in response to an enquiry by the British firm Frank C. Strick and Company. A letter from the Foreign Office expresses the view that there was no reason to discourage such commercial activity in Bahrain or any Arab territory where there was no risk of disputes over sovereignty between the British and Iranian Governments. A letter from the Board of Trade recommends that only 'perfunctory encouragement' should be given to the firm, given the fact that gypsum was available in large quantities in various parts of the world, and this latter approach was adopted by the India Office.The papers are mainly dated 1935-36. There are no papers in the file dated 1937-44.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Gypsum</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00019f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
