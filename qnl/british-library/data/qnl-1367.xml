D.O. No. C/341. o\' political Agency f i Kuwait, 5th October, 1939, My dear Colonel, It seems to me that there is a field for propaganda in the Gulf which has hitherto been neglected. This is the unconscious power of the \rab sailor to represent us in a favourable light over a very wide area, from Basra in the north to Madagascar in the south, and from Cape Comorin in the east to the Bed Sea in the west. w 2. There are more than a hundred ocean going Kuwaiti dhows, all of which leave Kuwait in the autumn and return in the early summer. The sailor papulation amounts to between five to six thousand men, together with about, three hundred carpenters and five hundred men of the nakhuda class. Though not every sailor goes to sea each ^ year, yet a high percentage do so, and dhow sailings^are, if anything, on the increase. In addition to the sailort,'- these dhows carry a large number of passengers, in some cases as many as one hundred and fifty, so that a large body of ;nen and a very wide measure of contacts with tie outside world are involved. miring their voyages, these men have ample time to talk with their passengers and the people they meet during their prolonged halts in the various ports they i^it. They may talk of tneir homes and their business, but they will also certainly discuss politics, a topic on which the ... , coffee/ The Hon f ble Lieut-Colonel C.G. rrior, OTB*, ■olitic^l Resident in the Persian Gulf, at Kuwait.coffee-ahop males will orovlde them jflth plenty of material for gossip. If these men start out on their travels ..ith a strong predilection for the British they will naturally espouse our cause, and will exert a strong influence upon those with who ; fi they oome into contact, it is not suggested that they should spread propaganda, hut that they should unconsciously and naturally see things from our point of view* 4. This could, I believe, he brought about by benefits being conferred on the sailors and their faiiilies in Kuwait* These men are mostly married, and they are steady men* But they are poor men, and while they are away their wives and children are left almost uncared for* Indeed some sailors are so poor that their youngsters have to sail with them as they cannot afford to keep them at home. 5* Of the possible ways in which His Majesty # s Government could develop this source of propaganda through attention to the sailor class of Kuwait, the two most obvious are medical and educational. As regards medical, some grant could be given or personnel loaned to the Kuwait Government to assist in developing medical facilities, but I would not recoinmend medical assistance except in conjunction with educational improvements* That I suggest is the provision of a school- doctor for Kuwait and also the establishment of a sufficient number of preparatory schools, (c*f* paragraphs 9 and 12 of Vallanee f s report forwarded to you under cover of my letter No. C/273 of the 10th July, 1939)* It seems to me that the merits of this proposal are that to carry it out would not be expensive, and the benefits would be lasting. Again, by assis ting in preliminary education only we should not be attempting to educate the boys beyond a station to which they could not hope to attain in later years. Should there be any doubt in your/3 your mind of the ability of the Arab sailor to broadcast by word of mouth, I would remind you of the story that the Shaikh related to you recently during your call upon him of the brutal action of a German officer towards a Huazzin in Dar-as-Salaam. That story was brought to Kuwait by Arab sailors, and is well known in the bazaars.

Enclosure• BagMr* C.A.F.Dund&amp;s’s Report on h is Tour fr oia 28th Sept . to 11th Oct * KUWAIT. I arrived in Kuwait on the morning of October 7th and was asked by the Political Agent, Major Galloway, to stay in hie house. I was fortunate in that the ir’olitical Resident, Major Prior, was in Kuwait at the time, so that I was able to discuss not only possibilities of British Council assistance for Kuwait, but for Bahrain as well. Outline of Bducatipnal Activities in Kuwait . (Kor the data included in this section 1 am indebted to Mr. Scott of the Kuwait Oil Company. I did not have an opportunity of checking up the statements made about the syllabus or standards reached in the various schools, but I have no reason to doubt their accuracy.) The corner stone of the educational pyramid is the Mabarakiyah School, which has about 350 boys ranging in age from eight to twenty. There is a Palestinian headmaster and last year there were eight assistant Palestinian masters, but I believe five of these are not returning. These Palestinian masters have been trained in Palestinian schools, and, in most cases, have degrees from the American University in Beirut. The school is divided into eleven primary classes of about thirty each and one '• secondary“ class of about twenty-five boys ranging in age from thirteen to twenty. The English in the secondary section is very poor. The syllabus of both primary and secondary sections includes Koran and religious Arabic reading, writing and grammar, English (including some v/riting), geography, simple arithmetic and geometry with some element/ary science. The out-put of the school is about twenty per year. There are three 'preparatory' schools, of which the best is the Armadiyah, which hat 170 boys aged seven to sixteen; the other two, the Kibliya and Sharkiya, have about 240 boys between them, and a standard of literacy is not insisted upon. The masters in these schools are all Kuwaitis 'with no kind of teaching training. With the exception of the schools I have mentioned there is nothing except a number of Koranic schools where instruction is given by Mullahs in the Koran and religion.Mr, C. A. F.Pundaa* s Report on his Tou r from 28th Sept. to 3.4 th Oct' * KUWAIT. English Master • In consequence of de Gaury’s educational report of January,1939, and subsequent correspondence, the British Council offered to pay part £ 500 per annum) of the salary of a teacher of English for Kuwait. Both Major .Prior and Major Galloway consider that the time is not yet ripe for an English master to be offered to the Shaikh of Kuwait and Major Prior is of the opinion that the British Council's offer would be much more valuable if the Englishman appointed were to be centred in Bahrain v/here he would be the senior English master of the Bahrain High School, and where he would probably be consulted on educational matters. If thi s were done. Major Prior suggests that the Shaikh of Bahrain might be asked to allow this Englishman to visit Kuwait occasion ally ±K and kx xiaxsliawx±k:x.sxEKgiistaanxk ex xii*ilxiKMwaif in order to advise upon the teaching of English in the Mabarak- iyah School. Major Prior considers that if this offer were made to the Shaikh of Kuwait he would be quite ready to accept and probably would be rather flattered at being able to get something for nothing from Bahrain. In another year or two Kuwait might be ready for an English teacher of its own. I would therefore recommend that the grant already allocated by the Council to Kuwait be cancelled and a similar grant made in the same terms to Bahrain. Major Prior suggests that the money should be paid quarterly to Mr.Belgrave, the financial adviser to the Shaikh of Bahrain• Major Prior has already v/ritten to lur.Vallance asking him whether he would accept the suggested appointment. The contract will be arranged as soon as Major Prior learns whether the Council agree to cancel the £ 500 allocation for Kuwait and to allocate, in its place, £ 500 for Bahrain.Mr« .Punaae*8 Heport on his Tour fr om 28 th oept . toi4th0ct. KU^/AIT • Handicrafts and Technical Education* Mr.Scott ^Kuwait t*il Company) some months ago put up a scheme to his Company for running a technical class in order to train Kuwaiti youths as artisans and skilled labourers for the Oil Company. His scheme, however, was turned down on the grounds of expense and he gave me to understand that it was unlikely that much financial assist ance would be forthcoming until the uil Company had started production, as it was almost impossible at this stage to estimate the probable output of oil or the length of time it would last. He has put up an alternative suggestion for employing a gang of some twel/ve Kuwaiti boys aged about fourteen under an Indian or other local stone-mason and putting them almost at once on to production work* At the end of three or four years those that remain would be of considerable value to the oil Company* If this experi ment were sufficient he would start other gangs for train ing in other types of skilled labour. Both Majjor irrior and Major Galloway considered that a trained handwork instructor for the kabarakiyah School would probably be acceptable to the Shaikh and would be of immense value in giving the ilder boys some kind of further training than they are at present getting from the School. Many of them are staying until the age of twenty learning nothing now, simply because they are unfitted for any job in Kuwait. If a suitable man could be found to organise sea scouts as a side line he would be still more valuable. A properly run sea scout troop would help to teach the Kuwaiti boys that there was nothing degrading in getting their hands dirty, in addition it would tend to attract the children of Kuv/aiti sailors. According to Major Galloway these represent a very far reaching medium for propaganda. There are something like 120 dhows in commission that travel for six or eight months in the year all over the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea and the East coasts of Africa, and sailors in these boats make innumerable contacts on their voyages, he has already encountered several instances of both anti-German gossip and pro-English gossip widely spread by this means, and 1 consider that anything done by Great Britain for the children of these sailors would have an amazingly wide publicity. 1 have no idea whe ther there is any possibility of finding a suitable man for such work, he should be experienced in teaching of wood and metal work. If he is an Englishman he should have some knowledge of Arabic or at least be ready to pick it up, as many of the boys he would be teaching would have practically no English. If it is not possible to find an Englishman there might be a chance of getting an ^rab on loan from either the Palestine or Sudan Government, but it is unlikely that a sea scout could be found from either of these sources. / (contd .)-2 It would also be necessary to provide some financial assistance to the handwork classes. Scott estimates this as about £ 700 initial outlay and some £ 400 to £ 500 a year for material. He thinks it probable that the Kuwait uil Company would cooperate with the Council and suggests that they should be tackled in London.Llr. .Dundaa T a Report 0 n hie Tour from 28th kept • to l4th Oct. KUWAIT. Gulf College . When Vallance visited the Gulf this summer at the request of the Governments of Bahrain and Kuwait he put up a proposal for a Gulf College in Bahrain working in conjunction with the Technical School already established there, tlaj or Prior was doubtful about the advisability of proceeding with this scheme, which is estimated by the Political Agent in Bahrain would cost something like £ 10,000 to build and would show a net deficit of £ 2,000 per annum declining to £ 1,500 for one hundred boys. I consider these figures are an under-estimate and should not like to give an opinion as to its likelihood of success without first visiting Bahrain, in principle the proposition sounds attractive, but the details are at present much too vague, though there is no doubt that an effort should be made to prevent Kuwaiti boys completing their education ^sic) in Iraq. General. Major Prior and Major Galloway considered it wiser for me not to call on Shaikh Hussein, as it might have aroused in him suspicions that there were political motives behind my visit. Galloway agreed to tell him more about the British Councils work before I returned to Kuwait and suggested that I should meet him on my next visit•Confidential Political Agency, • 1 • No • Cl/3» Kuwait, 4til January, 1940• My dear Colonel, Till you please refer to paragraph of landis *s report on Education in Kuwait? 2 # The nunibor of Palestinian teacii 0 i*s has again been made up to eight.

Subject.Translation of &amp; leading article published in the vernacular paper n ANNAL&gt; n No*918 dated August 15th, 1940, Arab problems have become complicated inspite of the awakening of the nation. No sooner has one Arab problem been solved in Syria or Palestine than another requiring treatment arises and it is not pleasant to see such a state of affairs which disappoints every Arab and Moslem. We say this in order to draw our reader# attention to the abbreviated news which we published in the local news column regarding a problem which concerned the sending of Kuwaiti students to Iraq. We and every Arab residing in the Gulf, or in any other country know that the Arab Princi palities in the Gulf have internal independence and that the treaties which were made between the English and the Chiefs of the Gulf Principalities do not refer to any interference in internal administration by the former. What the treaties do clearly express does not go beyond the enjoyment of some substantial and military benefits, and some other affairs relating to foreign policy. But with regard to the internal administration it has been left to the sons of the countries concerned particularly in the treaty between the British and Kuwait. If this is a fact, then how did the Political Agent, Kuwait, interfere in a matter which does not concern him, but which concerns the local people themselves? The Kuwait Govern ment had decided to send some students to Iraq to be educated at the expense of the Iraq Government. Iraq had welcomed them in the same way as it did all the others, having done this through the impulse of its national duty but the Political Basrah, under the heading: THE PRINCIPALITIES OF THE ARABIAN GULF AND ARE TEST INDEPENDENT OR COLONIZED?- 2 - Agent requested the Emir of Kuwait to abstain from sending the students. Although this aot is reckoned as a breach of the treaty existing between Kuwait and Great Britain, it is also reckoned as a disgrace to an Allied Power with Britain which represents the Arabs in all their countries. This act was received by every Arab with pain and sighs particularly by those lucky sons of Kuwait who count Iraq as a source of the Arab rising, and to be their extreme object of hope. No doubt this incident is attributed to the weakness shown more than once by the Shaikh Kuwait. His submission and his action in abolishing the Legislative Council which included the best elements of the sons of Kuwait, made this authority interfere, (although he has no right to do so), in an internal affair. This is not the first t occasion on which Iraq has opened the doors of its educational institutions to admit students to be educated there, but this was its own idea since it brought itself into existence and since it took over the reins of self Government. Iraq considers itself responsible for all the problems of the Arabs for it was elected the Arab leader in view of its vigilence over the interests of the Arabs which are of first rate importance to it. If a part of a nation is attacked or the rights of that part are transgressed the whole of that nation suffers through its relations and interests. What danger could the political Agent imagine there could be in sending Kuwait students to Iraq to be educated in Iraq schools. Moreover how did he dare to do so? He trespassed on a clear treaty and disgraced a nation in altime like the present when clean hearts, cordiality and fraternity are required. Do they expect the Arabs after this to trust in promises and to believe all that is said to them? The Arabs whether they were in Kuwait or in other countries did not love Iraq so deeply and so sympathetically until they had tested its position in serving the interests of tbe^I Arab/■•3— Arab nation of whiob Iraq is naturally proud, and Iraq friends should boast of than also. Iraq nowadays is proceeding with firm and sure steps towards the stabilisation of its interests and those of the Arabs and its wise Government (or Rashid Government) is doing all in its power for the whole interests of the Arabs, so that the Arab nation may be able to take its position in this world and to occupy a rank of which it is worthy. Its right to be free and independent is more than that of other nations and it is hard for it to bear any disgrace or whatever may effect its leadership. We write this and our hearts are full of grief, for this is an act that is not in agreement with the interests of the Allied Powers in such critical ciroumstanoes when goodwill is required and there should be no negligence of the rights of friends and allies. We request our labouring Government which represents the desires of the ij’abs, and request the states of the Arab Covenant which are responsible for the problems of the Arabs to be on their guard against this fearful act for we fear it may become worse and the countries of the Arabian Gulf will be subdued under foreign influence even in their internal policy. This of course will never be tolerated by the Arabs who are very covetous of their own interests. If we were and still are demanding our rights in Palestine and Syria how do we agree to any aggression taking place in any Arab country or area? Right does not agree to partition and the nation does not tolerate any aggression committed against her interests whatever it may be. We ought to be respected for this faith of ours if ■i the causes of this war are as it has been said for the preservation of the freedom of the people.Nn Bl/40/40 HIS Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad presents his compliments to the Political Agent at Kr&gt;weit, and has the honour to transmit to him the under-mentioned documents.

By this means he will avoid importing a number of tiresome and truculent schoolmasters, nor, since it is so late in the scholastic year, is it likely that he will be able to find suitable ones, more especially now that Syria is in a disturbed condition. The accent should be on technical education, for Kuwait cannot possibly support more than a small number of ’white collar* workers. 2.

The conclusions we come to I propose to send to you as soon as possible. I understand from Vallance that some of the recommendations he made last year have been put into effect, especially those which cost nothing. 3. Tith regard to Technical Education: The Shaikh has informed me that he will send four boys at his own expense to Bahrain and I will see that he does so as soon as details are fixed up. I think I am right in saying that he does not intend to send deserving boys from the Town, or to hold a public examination for the scholarships, but to send the sons of his cronies.

V Dear Major Galloway, The following is a brief report on the present state of Government Education in Kuwait. Its object is to present a reliable picture, which might form a basis for later discussions with a view to expansion or improvement. All the statistical figures given refer to the beginning of the scholastic year of 1359 «• 1360. 7- The Kuwait Government, working through an Education Committee, maintains thirteen schools in all, which may conveniently be class ified as follows s (1) Four boys* schools inside the Town wall (2) Three girls* schools inside the Town wall (3) Six *Mulla schools* for boys, situated at consider able distances from the Town. All these schools are briefly described later. Major A. C. Galloway, H.B.M.’s Political Agent, KUWAIT.3 The Education Committee is composed as follows : At the head of it is Shai&amp;i •Abdallah Jabir, who is called the Rais al Ma’arif, and next to him is Shailch Yusif bin 'Issa, known as the Mudir al Ma’arif. Then comes the Palestinian headmaster of the chief boys 1 school, the Mubarakiyah, with the title of Mudir al Ta’alim or Director of Studies. There are also six Members of the Committee, who are principal merchants of the Town, and a Kuwaiti rxaued ’Abd al Malik Salih, who acts as Secretary and Treasurer, at a monthly salary of 130 rupees. The Committee meets once a week, and makes decisions on all matters where money is concerned, on all matters relating to engagement or dismissal of staff, and on all more serious matters of school discipline, such as expulsions, and so on. Otherwise, the man agement of the schools is left largely in the hands of the Palestinian Director of Studies. This official arranges the syllabuses, time tables, and so on, of all the Government schools, and supervises their working, and in order to afford him the necessary time for these duties his own teaching hours, as headmaster of the Mubarakiyah School, are limited to twelve per week. Kuwait education is financed in the following way : Mr The Kuwait Oustoms House is required to maJte to the Educa tion Committee's treasurer a weekly payment amounting to of its takings (or of its profits after expenses ?}. and the Hamal Bashi Company (an undertaking which controls all the porterage and trans port work between the docks and the Customs House) is required to make a weekly payment of one-quarter of its profits (or takings ?). Last year, the Customs House contribution amounted to about 50,000 rupees, and that of the Hamal Bashi Company to about 10,000. Beyond these 60,000 rupees there was no source of income for Education s nor must the figures which I have quoted be taken as being representative ofwhat is normal. The Kuwait Customs is enjoying at the moment a consid erably increased revenue, resulting from the heavier volume of Sa’udi- Arabian traffic which has followed the virtual closing of the Red Sea and the port of Jiddah. In normal times the income for Education would be far less than it is to-day. While it is undoubtedly right that the am ount of money allotted for schooling should bear some relation to the prosperity of the State as a 'whole, in Kuwait the sum available in good times is too little, and in normal times is utterly inadequate. / The weekly payments by the Customs House and the Hamal Bashi Com pany are made promptly, but as the education expenses axe heavier in some months than in others (as, for example, at the end of the school year, when all the masters receive the Thole of their three months* holiday salaries in single payments), it frequently becomes necessary for the Committee to borrow money to tide over the difficulty. Small amounts are borrowed from Sh. Yusif bin ’Issa^ own pocket, and large amounts from the Town Treasury. At the end of last June the Committee borrowed in this way 10,000 rupees, which have since been repaid. (? No contingency-account money is held by any of the school head masters, or by anyone else, and all necessary purchases are made by means of written requisition, through the Committee’s treasurer. | The schools of Kuwait are open to rich and poor alike, and one of the most pleasing features of those inside the wall is a scheme Thereby very poor boys are clothed free of charge by the schools themselves, the funds for this purpose being provided, not out of the Education Grant, but from sums of money raised by means of entertainments given from time to time by the boys. About 10$ of all the pupils at the four town schools receive free clothing in this way. Books and stationery are issued free to all pupils too poor to purchase their own, and in practice this benefit is enjoyed by aboutthe Mubarakiyah ; by about 80$ 50$ of the boys at the largest school, of the boys at the other town schools ; and (in theory) by all the boys at the six ’Mulla schools’ outside the town. &amp; The scholastic year begins in about aiid-September, and lasts for nine months, without any break other than a fortnight in the Spring and the usual religious holidays, which are short but fairly numerous. The total number of children under Government education in Kuwait ■*s 1,350 - 1,072 boys and 278 girls. To deal first with male education inside the Town wall, the Gov ernment maintains four schools for boys, as follows : The Mubarakiyah (415 boys, 15 masters) The Sharcjiyah (140 boys, 8 masters) The Ahmadiyah (182 boys, 7 masters) The Q,abliyah (137 boys, 7 masters) tA The Mubarakiyah is always referred to as a 'secondary school', and the other three are called 'primary' schools, but the names are devoid of true meaning, for all four are in the proper sense of the word secondary schools - i.e. they provide instruction in subjects other than Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic - and the Mubarakiyah itself possesses a large 'primary' section. The only difference be tween the Mubarakiyah and the other three schools is that the former carries the general education of all the schools to a higher level than do the others, and that it adds to its curriculum the subjects ofAlgebra, Elementary Physios, Elementary Chemistry, and 'Commerce'. , ')_y The Ahmadiyah and the ^abliyah schools each contain four classes only, the Sharqiyah has fire, and the Jfubarakiyah nine (as well as a kindergarten section which is not reckoned as a class). The numbers by which the classes are known at the various schools correspond with one another as regards standard, so that a boy who has finished Class 5 at the Sharqiyah can then enter Class 6 at the Mubarainyah, and who has completed Class 4 at the Ahmadiyah or the (^abliyah can enter the liubarakiyah's Class 5. About 50% of all the boys at the three •primary' schools, and in the 'primary' section of the Mubarak*}ah, pass on in this way to the higher classes of the Mubarakiyah School, and this economical method of providing higher instruction is one which has ererytliing to commend it. j 1 The conditions governing entry to and sojourn at the four town schools are chaotic in the extreme. Officially there is a rule fftiich requires that every new boy before admission shall have attained the age of six } but what happens in practice is this s The par«.&lt;. tuugs to the school an infant of four or five years old, and declares his age to be nine or ten. If doubt is expressed by the headmaster, the parent poses the rhetorical question 'Am I then to be disbelieved about the age of my own son ?' , and if the headmaster considers it safe to reply in the affirmative the parent goes off to the Education Comnittee, or to Sh. 'Abdallah Jabir, and obtains permission for the hoy to enter. There are at the Mubarakiyah School this year about 25 children who are the merest infants, quite incapable of serious school work, and the same state of affairs obtains at the 'primary' schools. At the other end of the scale, things are equally unsatisfactory. In the higher classes of the Mubarakiyah are to be found more than 50 young men whose ages range from 20 to 28. Many of them are pupils of extreme dullness. Their presence in the schools is due to 3 causes s(1) Dull boys are allowed to spend as long as three years in each class, instead of the normal year. This rule, which was l alu down by the Education Committee against the views of the teacn ing staff, makes it theoretically possible for a dull boy to spend 30 years at the Mubarakiyah School, or 27 years at a 'primary' school and the Mubarakiyah combined. (2) It is only four years ago that Kuwait education was placed under a regular Government committee, and before that date allowed to enter the schools as new boys at any the boys at the Mubarakiyah whose ages are now over 20 entered it as new boys under the old regime. (3) Unemployment. Jots for young men are scarce in Kuwait, and this ^ leads parents to persuade their sons to stay on at school year after year, even if they are unable to obtain annual removes to higher classes. I^ As to dull or uneducable boys, there is no kind of ’net* to elim- mate them from the schools, other than the three-year rule described above. S To offset these serious disadvantages regarding conditions of sojourn and entry, there is an excellent rule which requires that all new pupils must register within the first fortnight of the school year ; and no new boys are accepted at any other time, unless they come from private schools and can take their places in class without detriment to the other members. j b The weekly hours of work in the schools are 32 periods of 45 or 40 minutes each ; and some attempt is made to lighten this for the infant classes by reducing the periods from 45 or 40 to 40 or 35. t j The average number of boys per class, in all the four schools, is pretty good. There are sufficient masters to enable classes to be lim ited to about 30 boys each ; but this advantage is somewhat discounted by the extreme smallness of the top classes (sometimes only half-a-dozen boys or so), which results in some overcrowding lower down.The syllabus of instruction in all the town schools for boys is an ambitious one. It has not been evolved as the result of any reasoned thinking on the part of the authorities, or in obedience to the needs created by local conditions, but has been imported wholesale from *Iraq, where the policy has long been to cram into the curriculum as many sub jects as possible, in order to impress the League of Nations and the gov ernments of other Arab states. At the same time, one is bound to recog nise one valid reason for the adoption by Kuwait of the * Iraqi syllabus. As long as Kuwaiti boys are encouraged or allowed to seek their higher education in Basrah or in Baghdad it must remain a definite advantage to them to have followed during the earlier years of their school life the stem of education which is in force in ’Iraq. All Kuwait schoolboys (inside the wall) study the following subjects even in the lower classes : . A $ur ’ an Religion Arabic Reading Arabic Penmanship Arabic Language Arithme tic Geometry /■■N, History Geography English Natural History Biology Civics Drawing Indoor Manual Work Clay Modelling Singing Physical Drill and in the Mubarakiyah, as we have seen, the list is extended by the add-ition of Algebra* Physios* and Chemistry* and* in the highest Class* H . The study of Physics and Chemistry at the Mubarakiyah is severely handicapped by lack of chemicals* equipment* and apparatus* and the commercial subjects boil down in practice to a little typewrit ing and some very elementary bookkeeping. Assuming that all the subjects enumerated above are desirable,'^ the proportionate allocation of time to each is pretty good* except that in the top classes of each of the 'primary' schools more time is given to the study of English than to that of any other subject. When I asked why English should be studied in the 'primary' classes at allj (i.e. in the fourth year of school life* which in Kuwait often begins well before the age of six)* I was told that the Education Committee had laid it down as an essential that Kuwait schoolboys should be very strong in English, and that the Director of Studies had decided that the only way in which this could be achieved was by starting Englisn 'one year earlier than they do in *Iraq'. The text-books in use at the Kuwait schools come mainly from ’Iraq, which means that the majority of them are Dadly-printed, poorly- arranged, inaccurate, and narrow in scope. An ’Iraqi history-book, for example ; will usually be found to consist of a sketchy and quite unreliable chronicle of Middle Eastern affairs alone* and a geography- book will discuss merely the topography of the Middle East, with the emphasis on large towns like Damascus and Baghdad. A natural history- book will describe the limited fauna of the desert ; and so on. It is quite a common thing for ’Iraqi schoolboys to compile and publish text-books* some of which actually find their way into the schools. Good text-books in the Arabic language, and Arabic text-books which deal with matters outside the Arab world* are notoriously few, and not much can be done about this at present. In Palestine, the Direc tor of Education has compiled a list of the more reliable text-booksin AraMc (most of them produced in Egypt), and in Bahrain we are over coming the difficulty, in our new Final Stage school, by giving the whole of the instruction in English, which will enable the best text books to be used, at very low cost, and will lead to a high standard of efficiency in English itself. But there is little present possibility of introducing this method into the schools of Kuwait. 't V xhe number of masters employed at the four schools, including the headmasters, is thirty-seven. Six of these are Palestinians, and the remainder are all of Gulf origin. Of the thirty-seven masters, fifteen (including all the Palestinians) can be considered useful employees, and six others are good liullas for Qur'an and Religion. The remaining sixteen are of very little value, and really should not be in the schools at all. In the view of the Director of Studies, eight good new teachers from Palestine are needed at once ; but I should describe this as a very conservative estimate. Palestinian teachers are recruited privately, by advertisement in the Palestine newspapers, and not through the Palestine Education De partment. The six now working at Kuwait are useful second or third- rate teachers. Only one of them, the headmaster of the iiubarakiyah, has been trained as a teacher (and that only in Baghdad), and not one of them has had a regular school career as a boy, or has attended a university. They axe, however, superior to the local men. •VM Apart from the few teachers obtained from Palestine, new masters are enlisted by the method of promoting 8th or 9th Class Mubarakiyah schoolboys - a vicious circle which can result in little success until sound education has been established at the Mubarakiyah School itself. Four new masters were created in this way at the beginning of the pres ent school year s they are little more than boys, and have had no training as teachers whatsoever.As is usual in Arab schools not under outside control, the young est and weakest masters have been allotted to the lowest classes, in all four schools. The Director of Studies is aware of the extreme unwisdom of this policy, but is forced to adopt it if he is not to deprive the top classes of the few able masters which the schools poss ess. It need hardly be added that the amount of education imparted to the younger pupils of the Kuwait schools is extremely small, or that the boys thus acquire no sound foundation upon which more advanc ed work might be built later on. All the work of the boys in the higher classes at Kuwait shews this clearly. The salaries paid to masters at the four schools are as follows : To deal first with the Palestinians, the headmaster of the Jlubara- kiyah, who acts also as Director of Studies for all the schools, in cluding the girls' schools and village schools, is paid £19 per month (raised this year from a previous £17.10.0). Three of the others re ceive £14, and the remaining two, £13. There are no allowances, of any kind, and the masters find their own accomodation. Their trav elling expenses between Palestine and Kuwait are paid at the begmn- ing and end of 'their service. V) The above salaries for Palestinians, though reasonable, are out of all proportion to those paid to Kuwaitis, the most fortunate of whom receives just over £5 a month, and the worst-paid less than £3. These figures compare badly with those now in force for local born masters at town schools in Bahrain. All masters at the four schools are engaged on year-to-year con- tracts. in the staffs of the sohoole are frequent, and this is Changes of course very bad for the work and for the boys.The discipline of the schools seems to be good, despite the lact that many of the masters are slovenly in appearance, unshaven, and so on, and that untidiness and disorder in the school premises axe everywhere apparent. There is on the other hand a quiet and studious air about all the classrooms, which speaks well for the intentions of the staff, what ever may be the performance. Of the four town schools, only two, the Mubarakiyah and the Ahmad- iyah, are the property of the Government. The Sharqiyah and the ^abli- are rented buildings, each at 200 rupees per annum. The Sharqiyah is too small for its present purpose (all the already small rooms having had to be divided into two, in order to accomodate in the proper classes the 140 boys which the school is trying to educate), and the ^abliyah building is quite unsuitable for school purposes. I understand that there is only one other house in Kuwait suitable for conversion into a school, but this is at present occupied by a doctor. The cost of build ing two new schools would be about 15,0GG rupees each. The state of repair of the present school buildings is oetween fair and poor. A good deal of work could usefully be done on all of them. V The school equipment is meagre, and in poor condition. The school desks are all badly designed, and they bear little relation to tne sizes of the boys who have to sit in them. All the writing-surfaces are far too narrow to allow of proper handwriting ; and three boys are made to sit in desks which were designed for two. These deficiencies in the Kuwait schools all militate against good work. y*- Some of the suggestions which were made in the June 19.39 fteport have been adopted, especially where they did not entail the expenditure of money. The Syrian National Anthem, to which exception was taken, isstill sung in the schools, but it has now been adapted to Kuwait by the substitution of the words ’Kuwait* or ’Kuwaiti* for ’Syria* or ’Syrian'. The heads of foreign potentates have disappeared from the exercise-books provided by the schools themselves, and the head of the Shaikh of Kuwait has taken their places : but boys are still allowed to bring to school privately-purchased books displaying on their covers the portraits of Riza Khan or the boy-king of ’Iraq. Proper copy-books for the teaching of English handwriting have been secured for the schools, but owing to ignorance on the part of the teachers they have not been properly used. Written work is still done in pencil, instead of in ink. / ^ Some attempt has been made to provide the medical care for school- ( x ildren which was so strongly urged last year. The Syrian doctor late ly engaged by the Government to take charge of municipal health has been instructed that school work forms part of his official duty, and all the headmasters now send sick boys to him as a matter of routine : but he shews no interest in those who are absent from school through illness. This means that if a boy is only slightly sick, and therefore able to walk to the doctor’s house, he will receive attention : but if he is really sick, and therefore unable to walk at all, nothing whatsoever will be done, officially, to help him. To turn now to the schools for girls, the Government maintains three of these, all situated inside the town of Kuwait. They are : The Wasita (164 girls, 6 teachers) The Jibliyah, or ^ibda (94 girls, 3 teachers) The Sharqiyah (20 girls, 1 teacher). The last-named has been newly opened only this year. Conditions in the girls' schools are in many respects identical with those which obtain in the schools for hoys, except that the Director of Studies does not enter them. He is, however, authorised by the Education Committee to demand for his inspection, whenever he sees fit, the production of all the written work recently done by the girls, and in this way he is able to exercise some limited control over their schooling. wait, owing to an unfortunate incident which occurred towards the end of last June, and which I will describe in this report in some detail, since it sheds an interesting light upon Kuwaiti methods in connection with the staffing of schools, and also possibly upon certain outside influences to which Kuwait education is exposed. Last year, the girls* schools of Kuwait contained one Kuwaiti teacher, two ’Iraqis, and three Palestinians. The Palestinians were three sisters, who had arrived in Kuwait under the chaperonage of a brother, who was later taken on as a master at one of the boys* schools. All four were efficient teachers. Very shortly before the end of the school year, a story was spread in the town to the effect that the sisters were taking some of their young pupils, for immoral purposes, to the brother ; and a good deal of excitement ensued. Those who be lieved the story were probably unaware that an exactly similar accusa tion had, only a fortnight earlier, been spread against five Syrian female teachers in Baghdad. Both in Baghdad and in Kuwait the accusa tions were followed by dismissals, and in Kuwait the brother immediate ly sent in his own resignation as well. Where this little plot, if plot it was, originated, it is impossible to say ; but what followed is possibly significant. The Director of Studies at once asked leave to set about the engagement of fresh Palestinian teachers in place of those dismissed : but Sh. Yusif bin *Issa vetoed this, saying that he wished personally to obtain the new teachers ; and in due course he produced no less than five new women teachers, whom he had recruited in * Iraq. One of these had previously taught at a government school Female education is at the moment somewhat under a cloud in Ku-at Amarah or Diwaniyah, and the other four were schoolgirls who had reached only Class 3 at the government secondary school at Basrah. The net result of the exchange, therefore, is not only that the girls* schools of Kuwait have been saddled with a number of almost useless teachers, but also that ‘Iraq has obtained in them a greatly increased representation. Of the ten female teachers now employed, seven are ’Iraqis, two are Palestinians, and only one is a Kuwaiti. It may be added, in conclusion, that the Education Committee now claims that the reason for the dismissal of the three Palestinian women was that they refused to remain in Kuwait, as they had been asked to do, during the ^ three months of their summer holidays ; but I do not believe there is a word of truth in this. The standard of education at the girls* schools falls far below that of the boys’ schools, and the cause is the inadequacy of the teaching. A glance at the qualifications of the members of the female staff of the Wasita, the most important of the girls* schools, will make this clear. At the head of it is the new ’Iraqi teacher,found by Sh. Yusif, who had previously taught at Amarah or Diwaniyah ; then come the four half-educated schoolgirls from Class 3 at Basrah ; and at the end a Palestinian woman who is not a teacher by profession at all. There is a bad habit in Kuwait of engaging women as teachers, and even of making them headmistresses, simply because they happen, as wives or sisters of male foreign teachers, to be resident in the town. The Palestinian woman in question came to Kuwait to look after her brother, and was promptly taken on as a teacher at the Wasita ; and this is typical of the haphazard way in which female education in Kuwait is conducted. ixA ^ salaries paid to the women teachers are as follows ;The headmistress of the Wasita School is paid £10 per month, and the two other headmistresses, with five assistant mistresses, each re ceive £ 8 . The Palestinian mistress who is not really a teacher gets £4, and the single Kuwaiti mistress has to he content with 40 rupees. The travelling expenses of women teachers from outside Kuwait are paid in the same way as those of the men. Finally, there are the six t Mulla schools* situated at consider able distances from the town. One of these is established in the village of Jahrah, due west of Kuwait, about half-an-hour by car, on the road to Basrah. It contains about 30 Ooys, taught by a single Mulla, who is paid 25 rupees per month. Another stands on the island of Failaka, which is about an hour by motor-boat from Kuwait. Here there are about 70 boys, under two Mullas, who receive 30 rupees and 25 rupees respectively. The other four are all situated on the sea- coast, south of the Bay of Kuwait, and are between half-an-hour and one hour by car from the town. They are : Dimnah (35 boys, 1 Hulla* 20 rupees) ; Fantas (35 boys, 1 Mulla, 20 rupees) ; Abu Hilaifa (17 boys, 1 Mulla, 15 rupees) ; and Faihil (11 boys, 1 Mulla, 15 rupees). \ I have visited five of these six village schools, but Failaka, owing to transport difficulties, I have not yet been able to see. They are fairly typical of the ’Mulla schools’ to be found in this part of the world, where the Mullas confine themselves to the teaching of the Qur’an and Religion, with a little reading, writing, addition ; and subtraction, and at these subjects usually do their limited best. The presence in the villages of ’Mulla schools’ is certainly better than no schools at all, and with a little care, encouragement, and support they can be turned into really serviceable village schools. But in Kuwait, after a little preliminary fostering, they are utterly neglec ted, by all concerned. The policy of the Education Committee seems to be as follows : Having discovered a Mulla and his little ragged circlein some corner of a village mosque, it proceeds to build in the desert a little mud-room, measuring thirty feet by fifteen, and to put round it four very high walls, each sixty feet in length, one of them containing a tiny wicket-gate for entrance. When this is done, it informs the ast onished Mulla that in future it will pay him each month the few rupees which in the past he has been forced to extract from the parents of his pupils. It then invites the whole party to quit the precincts of the mosque and to enter the new ,, school ,, s and there the Government stops dead. All that it does, in reality, is to give to these little communi ties 'a local habitation and a name” : the schooling which the children f^ceive remains exactly the same as it was before the move, except that the Mullas are now less dependent, for their livelihood, upon their skill as teachers - they are in safe jobs, where their pay no longer bears any relation to the numbers of their pupils. Before I visited the village schools of Kuwait, the Director of Studies had assured me that he inspected each of them regularly once every year, and that they were all supplied free with hooks and station ery : hut when I took him with me on my visit he was unafcl* to locaU the sites of the more distant schools, and I was unable to find, in any jaf the schools, any trace of hooks or stationery. The Director said that they had certainly been supplied last year, and that if they had not reached the villages this time, it was because the school year was, so far, only three weeks old. ( , The Mullas at Jahrah, Dimnah, Fantas, and Abu Hilaifa seemed to oe bright and painstaking men, whose boys did credit to the limited teach ing which they had received ; but at Faihil, the most distant school, we found an enormously fat Mulla asleep in bed, inside the school, which also contained his kitohen-fire, his cooking utensils, and his food. The place was filthy, and the few copies of the Qur’an which the school possessed had been thrown carelessly into a corner (a thing which I havenever seen before* in any Muslim sctiool). Tliere was no sign of any pupils, or of their recent presence in the school. The blackboard, useless as a piece of bedroom furniture, had been put outside in tne school-yard. Adjoining the school premises was the Mulla 1 s own house, which contained his wife and family ; but he himself preferred the peace and quietness of the Government school. , v There is no medical care whatsoever of village schoolboys. There axe no village doctors, or medical facilities. The Syrian doctor re ferred to above has merely informed the Director of Studies that sick boys from these very poor villages (which are twenty miles or more away from Kuwait) must in to the town to see him : he did not enter into the question of ways or means, and there the matter has been left. At the school at Dimnah, the whole of the 13 boys present (it was Ramadhan) were suffering from curable eye-disease. As I reported last year, the medical position in Kuwait as regards the care of children would be a reproach to any self-respecting State . it is to be hoped that before long the education authorities of Kuwait will see the wisdom of supplying each of these distant schools with at least one capable teacher to work side-oy-side with the Mullas, who are excellent men for religious instruction alone. The village schools will also have to be brought under some form of proper super vision, if they are to achieve any success worth mentioning ; and proper medical care is a crying necessity. In conclusion, it must not be supposed that all Kuwaiti boys who receive education receive it in Kuwait. Parents are still sending their sons to ’Iraq or to Beyrouth, and their declared reason for so doing is that Kuwait education is at present unahle to provide their offspring with adequate equipment for the future. Those who send their hoys away belong mostly to the merchant and business section of the public, andthere are to rqy knowledge twenty-four Kuwaiti boys at present being educated abroad, most of them in f Iraq.. The dangers oi this were pointed out last year in a private letter to the British Adviser at Bahrain, a copy of which I think you have seen. This brings me to the end of a very brief report, and I may sum it up by saying that, assuming that Kuwait education is to continue to be directed by an Arab, 90&gt; of its deficiencies will be traceable to the three main difficulties by which the present Director of Studies finds himself constantly beset, he is a fair ly able and adaptable man, willing to take advice, and capable of running the Kuwait schools with some success, and of improving their standard of education, if only he were unhampered by (1) Inadequacy of the Education Grant, vhich leads to a V ' serious and permanent shortage of good teachers. (2) Interference hy the educationally ignorant Education ' ' ^ a. i ^ ^ i or* t.i ve 1 v and individually. Committee, tooth collectively and individually (3) Absence of constant knowledgeable advice. ^ Remedies for (1) and (2) are not for me to deal with, tout I could, if required, outline a simple scheme whereby the constant knowledgeable advice mentioned in (3) would toe forthcoming. Believe me, Yours sincerely, G .R -L .ADR I AN-VARIANCE .Para. 7. Payment for education in Government schools. All Government education is at present free, but it would be a good 'to thing if all education above Glass 5 ohau!4 be paid for by those who can afford to do so. As far as I can find out, this would amount in practice to only 25$ of the total number of boys at the only school which has Glasses 7, 8 , and 9 - i.e. the Mubarakiyah. Two years ago, some such scheme was actually in force in Kuwait. The Education Gommittee divided all the schoolboys into three cate gories - those who could pay 2 rupees per month, those who could pay 1 rupee per month, and those '^0 could not pay at all ; and the total annual revenue from this scheme was between 1,500 and 2,000 rupees. Even two rupees per month seems to me a ridiculously small sum for men of the merchant and business class to be asked to pay : 1 think it ought to have been more like 5 or 6 at the lowest. It was not very bright of the Gommittee to advertise the fact that their educa tion was not worth more than two rupees per month. I suggest six rupees per month for Category 1, and three rupees for Category 2, and 1 rupee for all others - the rupee, in oases of extreme poverty,being paid by the Government^in the form of a schol arship which is given only after the strictest investigation has been made into the financial circumstances of the boy’s parents.Reform of school syllabuses I do not quarrel with the more ambitious subjects of study, as given in my Report, so long as they are to be studied only by the boys in the Glasses above the 'primary' sections of the schools - i.e. in Glasses 7, 8, and 9. But for younger boys they are unnecessary, and some of them are absurd. I should suggest that the first six classes of the system should omit at any rate English, geometry, biology, and civics. All these could begin in Glass 7 of the Mubarakiyah ; and on the other hand/ the Mubarakiyah should discontinue the study of Chemistry and Physics, at least until they have a proper laboratory, proper equipment and chem icals, and a really qualified teacher. The 'Commerce' class at the Mubarakiyah is an excellent idea, but it is at present very elementary, and should be strengthened by the engagement of an expert typewriting teacher who could also give really efficient instruction in bookkeeping and commercial practice. This subject should be studied in English, not in Arabic. A few typewriters should be available for use by the boys, but only under expert super- vision. A.11 the above suggestions are ^ base^on the assumption that the tIraq method of education is to be retained at Kuwait. Indeed, it has now got such a hold that only a foreign Director could impose a new one on the masters and the schools ; and it would take a long time. Even in Bahrain we are only able to bring it about by slow degrees Boys in Classes 1 to 3 (i.e. infants) should be confined to Religion, Reading, Writing, Arit hmetic, Manual Work, oinging, anu Physical Drill.Cost of restaffing the schools with efficient teachers. It would be a mistake to engage men who are equal to or inferior to the present Palestinians. This means that the new men would have to be paid about &lt;£15 per month each, as a minimum. They should come from Palestine, but in order to ensure success they should either be ob tained direct from the Director of Education in Palestine, or the Secretariat should be asked whether the Palestine Director of Education could Wet* each of the proposed new masters before they are finally engaged, and advise the Political Agency at Kuwait as to whether they are really efficient teachers. That is to say, we could still allow the Kuwait authorities to advertise for and find the men, but the last word before final engagement would lie with the Palestine Education Department. I should add that if it were proposed to ask the Pales tine Director of Education to send Government teachers, on loan, as we are doing at Bahrain, he would only agree to do so provided that Kuwait paid them their full Palestine salaries, plus 25% expatriation allowance, plus small percentage of salary required by the Palestine Government Pension Scheme, plus 25 rupees per month house allowance. This seems a lot, but so low are the Palestine salaries that the total would not amount to much more than the «£15 per month which I nave mentioned as a desirable salary at which to engage the new men. In some cases it would actually be less, as for example, where the new man was a quite efficient teacher, but was young, and therefore had received very few increments to salary. The total cost of restaffing, at &lt;£15 per month per man, of course depends upon the number engaged. This should not be less than 8 , ana it ought to be sixteen. Cost therefore either £1,440 or £2,880 per 9 annum. The men displaced might be sent to the village schools, except those of them who are ex recent ex-9th Class schoolboys, who might be sent to the new school at Bahrain, to be trained as teachers for the Kuwait schools. This would take three years.Desks. Ink. I consider the supply to the schools of proper desks, and the use of ink instead of pencils, as indispensable preliminaries to really satisfactory work in the Kuwait schools. I cannot estimate the cost of desks locally made ; but about 400 double desks would be needed, and the important thing is that they should be properly designed, and properly graded as regards size. I could, as I have told you, send 4 or 5 carpenters, who could do the work on the spot, with materials bought by the Government locally.Para. 27. Payment of Kuwaiti teachers. The salaries of the Kuwaiti teachers are far too low, except in the cases of one or two men. If a Kuwaiti teacher is not a good man, he should not he employed in the schools : if he is a good man, he should he properly paid. In any case, there should he regular fixed scales of pay, and yearly increments, however small. Again, a man should not he poorly paid solely because he is a Mulla who teaches only Religion. If the religion teacher on the staff of a school teaches it well, he is as useful a man as any other assistant master on the same staff, and should he properly paid. This refers to Mullas teaching in town schools. At Bahrain, the minimum salary for a local-horn Government teacher is 50 rupees per month, with an annual rise of 5 rupees, and a limit of 100 per month. The minimum for a Mulla in a village school is 30 rupees, with rises of 2 rupees per month, and a maximum salary of 50 rupees.wamm Political \genoy t Kuwait, Ootol&gt;er 28th 1940. #111 you please r^?ar to paragraph 6 o: r*v dtfLU-offioial letter !fc. 446 of the 2 .

Political Agency Kuwait. .Wiw ELJL U I October 29th 1940* My dear Colonel I enclose two copies of a report submitted by Vallance during his visit here in September and October this year. 3. I did not lenow that an education committee was in existence. This resembles Boards of Governors in our educational system, and may serve some useful purpose here. However we need not concern our selves with it I suggest. The number of schools is the same as last year. 4. 7e were already aware of the sum available and cannot when considering education as a whole in Kuwait, think in terms of good and bad years. 5 and 6 . No comment. 7 and ?A. Schooling was not free in Kuwait until two years ago, when between one and two rupees a month were paid, a ridiculously low figure. Mallance suggests (not in the report) that fees per term per boy attending the top three classes of the Mubarakiyah should be Bs. 6 , half that figure for Y t. ^ h Y'O o ^ T &lt;a OQQCJ a TV? +_ O TVamr* YiH suggestion in that it would prevent a number of parents sending their children to sonool to keep them out of harms way, and would prevent educating boys just for the sake of education, on the other hand to revert to payment now would be bad for prestige, as it would be looked upon as a retrogressive step, and, at the present time, I am against any suggestion to raise money from the people for state Institutions. I think that this point had best be left alone for the time being. 8 . No comment. 9 and 10. The number of boys and girls attending school is a very small percentage per head of the population but l think that we had better concentrate on suggestions for the improvement of what is already in existence rather than suggest expansions. 11 and 12. No comment. 13 and 14. I might bring the main points to the Shaikhs notice. 15,16 and 17. No comment. My comments are as follows The Hon*ble Lieut.-Col, 0.0. Prior, O.I.B., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf B U S H I B B. 18 /19/35. .- 2 -. 18 and 19. T assume it is too early for us to suggest a complete separation from the Iraqi method of education, and as I think some modification of the present ambitious system is necessary, my proposals, whioh I have discussed with Vallance, are made on the above assumption* The syllabus can stand for the top three olassej of the lyrubarakiyah, and the remainder should onit geometry, biology, civics; chemistry and physics to be omitted from all classes unless proper equipment is forthcoming. The commercial class is an excellent idea. ?ut so far it is not much more than that, and I think I should point out to the Shaikh that his statement to me that instead of sending boys to Iraq he has opened a commercial class here can only be accepted as empty until an instructor and equipment such as typewriters books etc. are provided. Classes 1,2 and 3 should only study the three Bs, plus singing, physical training and manual labour. 20 .The principle is correct, and with the small control we have we need not concern ourselves with detailed operation. If we make Vallance *s suggestion to the Shaikh it may be regarded as a damper. 21.1 will write to Palestine for the list. 22 and 24. de cannot suggest improvements in the staff unless an increased income is assured. I have collected the various expenditures mentioned by Vallance in the report and they total about bs. 4200 a month. This excludes the cost of books and incidentals, and eats up all the income approximately. To restaff the schools with a dozen or so efficient teachers from Palestine would cost about 30,000 rupees a year, and before any Mention can be made of a suggestion of improvement in the staff to the shaikh, it must be decided what proposals we have to make for increased funds. 23.My offer of help in this matter was declined. 25.Improvement again is a question of funds. I venture to disagree, so far as Kuwait is concerned, with Tallance regarding the employment of the weakest masters in the lower classes, for as so small a proportion of the boys reach the top classes to allot the best instructors to the lowest classes would be uneconomical and futile. 26.No comment. 28 and 29. This is unsatisfactory but we need not concern ourselves now I suggest. 30.No comment. 31.If it is decided to put a proposition for increased funds to the Shaikh then I think that mention might be made of the need of two new buildings. 32,33 and 34. These points might be brought to the Shaikh*s notice. Vallanoe says that he thinks that some 400 desks are needed. As regards the national anthem I will address you separately.35, This might be further impressed on the Shaikh. Personally I do not agree that mq can exp go t the Kuwait Government to insist on free house to house treatment for sic^ ooys. 36.37,38.39 anl 40. I think that we need not concern ourselves with female G&amp;ucation at this stage, out I suggest that the folly of refusing to send the hoys to Iraq., and at the same time employing Iraqi teachers for the girls might he pointed out to the ^aikii. 43,46 and 43. 'hat something is being done is satisfactory. 47. This can only he put right by the opening of dispensaries which need not ho conslierad in this letter. 49. This aspect is receiving our attention. 50 and 51. The inadequacy of the educational grant, based on improvements re conn ended by Yallance, excliidinc female education, amounts in round figures to Bs. 30,000 for instructors (recurring expenditure) and as. 15,000 for busings, and Bs. 5000 for equipment (non recurring expenditure). The fol?„craing ways of raising these funds occur to me. (a) Taxation. This is out of the question I think. (b) School fees. T think inadvisable see notes on paragraphs 7 and 7A. , . .. (c) Profits from such sources as the landing Company and the Electricity Company. These are semi-state concerns but without knowing mors of their composition I would not recommend making any suggestions in this connection. (d) Allotting a proportion of the Oil and Sulphur annual receiotsT This is the obvious source to be tapped now, but to what extent it is not so e^sy to determine. The Shaikh is now drawing some Bs. 500,000 from these sources. A suggsstdon from us night take the form of the Shaikh’s making a contribution to Educational Tunds on a percentage basis in the same way as present funds are obtained. I have no guide as to what to suggest, but think tiiat 5£ would be reasonable and if acted upon would provide sufficient money on which to make a start. Tithout very considerable oressure the Shaikh would not part with this amount but he might be induced to part with li % fairly easily. ^ ^ w (e) Provision of the British Council of a teacher for English. While it is no part of His Majesty’s Government’s obligations to provide a teacher for Kuwait the spreading of cultural propaganda is one of their interests. Tn fact, only last year it was decided to sent Tallance to Kuwait on behalf of the British Council, though later it was agreed that Kuwait was not ready for such a step, flow, however, I think the matter might be reconsidered if we are to co-operate with the State in the improvement of education. It will be seen from Vallanoe’s report that the study of English is considered of great importance and now I hear that the Shaikh is sending his two youngest sons to study English in the evenings under an Arab Christian. It is. therefore, possible that from the next school year toe State might be willing to accept an English flaster, not a Director of Education (Vallanoe had something of this in view of his paragraph 51), and if things go on much as at present I think Kuwait would stand an Englishman by that time. If this step /were.-4- \q\\ I sft’.j • vsrere agreed upon f and the Shaikh could he induced to part with some of his royalties, education in Kuwait ^ would have taken a great step forward. This man might in addition run an evening institute as teaching English would only occupy his mornings. I have not fully considered such a proposition, hut T think there can he no harm in submitting^it tentatively now. , There is also a possibility that his services might befutilised in connection with Teohnical Education, and T will submit a separate letter on that point. If we are to resist Iraqi penetration somet dng must be provided in return, and I do not believe that Bahrain will ever supply that something in the eyes of Kuwaitis. If there are no facilities at home, then tney will look westwards, however sourkl Bahrain institutions may be. In any case there is nothing free about the facilities growing up in Bahrain. 3 . While the question of provision of funds and possible help from the British Council is under consideration, I suggest that I address a letter to the Shaikh on the lines of my comments above.. /■&gt; r^\ Confidential. D.O. No. C/501. Wty dear Colonel, 0L&gt; Political Agency, Kuwait, 28th October, 1940. \ A (0 Till you please refer to paragraph 2 of your memo randum No. C/883 of the 14th December, 1939? 2 . I have very little to say concerning Vallance^ visit this year and in that little I must say that I was very dis- app )inted with the visitrisg.. First of all I asked Vallance to write me a brief factual report on education here. This he set about doing after he had been here some five days (he arrived before I returned from recess although X had told him I could not put him up until later). That is to say that he started work on the 23rd and submitted the report on the 9th of October (it is dated the 1st). During the oo urse of the preparation I asked him more than once to be brief and speedy, and not to worry too much over dotting Is and crossing Ts, but my expostu lations were of no avail. Had he based this report on last year’s he would have saved a lot of time, but he did not even think of referring to it. 3. As to the report itself, it is, in my opinion, tedious. It occupies itself with petty scandals, and is particularl.y remarkabl e/ The Hon’ble Lieut-Col. C.G.Prior, CIE., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire•-2- ^ (§&gt; remarkable for its lack of information on the actual work of the boys. The report is nicely typed. 4. I also wanted Vall&amp;nce to hold some sort of class him self, and 1 suggested anevening class to instruct the masters who teach English. The matter was broached to the Headmaster who demurred, but although I decided to disregard that,the length of time taken over the report (it works out at about two pages a day) prevented anything in this direction. During the few days after the submission of the report Vallance held an examination in the Mubarakiyah School to select four boys for Technical Education in Bahrain, and otherwise was helpful. 5. Vallance was more cordially received by the Educational Authorities than last year, and hies visit was beneficial as showing to the Kuwaitis that we take an interest in educational affairs. The inspection also helps to keep all concerned up to scratch. This right to inspect education in Kuwait which we are gradually building up is very valuable indeed, and next year I hope to be able to submit a more favourable report. Yours sincerely.D.O.

I have now received from the Shaiich six monthly 'statements of receipts and expenditures' and also an equal number of so-called balance sheets. T can make neither head nor tail of the statements, and the balance sheets are not always balanced. In the instances when they are balanced, the credits are not carried on from one month to another. I have endeavoured to get explana tions from the Shaikh’s Secretary, but he states that he has had nothing to do with the preparing of the statement. Abdulla Salim asked him one day to help, but he refused as he felt that all was not above board. All he knows is that the Shaikh’s clerk one day brought him the statements for typing. Sven if I knock any shape into the statements, they are not what we want, and I will tackle the Shaikh again. 3. One item stands out clearly, and that is an expen diture of Rs. 2,999-11-4 for students sent to the Bahrain Technical School. It appears, therefore, that the Shaikh did not pay for the boys out of his royalties, but from State funds. Yours sincerely, p Hon’ble Lieut-Col.

Dundas made the suggestion that if Kuwait were to send one of their permanent education officials to, say, the Sudan to see efficiently run educational establishments they might gain considerably. I thought the idea a good one, for, as you know, all the Shaikhs here are abysmally ignorant of the world outside Kuwait, and unless some one’s mind is broadened it is hopeless to expect much improvement. The Director himself has no standard to aim at, and he just basks to the rosy bliss of ignorance. A difficulty is to find a Shaikh with sufficient drive to introduce desirable reforms; Abdulla Jabir, the Director of Education, is young but he might serve the purpose. Dundas has promised to make a few preliminary enquiries, and though I daresay nothing will come of the suggestion, I thought you might like to know that it had been mooted.

Their songs were not ordinary scouting songs, nor well- known songs such as they might have all knov/n and sung spontaneously. The boys stood up to sing in regular rows, and the beat was given by one of their Palestinian teachers, named Ibrahim al 'Id. (N.B. Of the teachers who accompanied them, only a junior one was a Kuwaiti). The subject of the songs was Palestine, the killing and ill-treatment of Arabs there. They sang about half a dozen 'nashids'. 3. On a later evening, at the Nadi al Mukhtabat ar- Riyadhia, they insisted on singing, although Kemal Mehza (Mr. Vallance's secretary) tried to interest them in games. 4.

It is difficult to estimate the cost, as methods of transport are so uncertain. His air return passage from Basrah to Khartoum would be £145. His journey overland, which would take about 10 days each way, would cost approximately £100 and to this would have t o be added food and accommodation en route. His expenses in the Sudan would not be high say £30 for two to three weeks. 2. Aden could be reached by boat to Bombay and from Bombay to Aden. This might entail some delay waiting for a connexion in Bombay. Pares would be about £125 return. The Director of Education in the Sudan has already informed me that he would welcome Abdul Ajaba’s visit and arrange for a bear leader. 3. If the Council agree to this visit, please inform the Cairo Office and the Political Resident by cable» with a copy to the Political Agent at Kowait, so that arrangements can be made for his visit to take place in May or early June.

Am writing airmail more fully'. Am writing airmail more fully' The Civil Secretary agrees with me that the proposed visit of Abdul A^aba would be very welcome, and I should do my best to see that he was given every facility for seeing our system at work. The war has depleted the numbers in our department, and I cannot promise as thorough personal guidance as I could have done in peace-timej he will of course appreciate that feet. As to the date, our Higher Schools are closed from mid-May to late August, Gordon College (secondary school) and all Intermediate Schools from late May to early august, and the Elementary Schools for varying lesser oerlods within the same dates. Our teacher-training school at Bakht er Ruda, probably the most novel and interesting feature of our system, closes now and reopens on July 9th.

Dundas of the British Council paid a visit to Kuwait in 1939. Last year he was unable to visit Kuwait but I understand that Major Galloway went . to meet him in Basra. Mr. Dundas is much interested in educational problems and the suggestion was made that it would probably be of benefit to Your Highness* State if the Director of Sducation, Shaikh Abdulla = Jabir, were provided with an opportunity to inspect a modem educational system. The British Council who are always anxious to further the pursuit of knowled-, ge have informed the Hon*ble the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf that in their t opinion the system in use in the Sudan would be a suitable one to study and the Director of Education in the Sudan has suggested that September would be a suitable month. I feel that Your Highness will agree that much benefit is to be obtained from such a visit and T hope that Your Highness will consider the proposal favourably. In the event of your Director of Education being able to undertake the Journey the British Council desire to defray/ *1\ O' • 2 - ^ s {%$ * defray the expenses of the visit and I have received instructions to arrange for Shailch AMulla Jahir’s return passage to Khartoum.

Copy Dear Maurice, Bor some time past discussions have, i believe, been going on regarding the possibility of establishing alter the war some Arab educational centre under British direction. The arguments in favour of such a plan are many and convincing. 2* One aspect of the question which seems to give the proposal additional importance is the large number of *rab students who have in the past come to Iraq from Arab speaking dependencies of the British and Dutch ISnpires, and from the Yemen. At the moment we have established touch with 33 such students, distribu ted as follows It is very dndesirable from every point of view that pupils shou-. come to seek education in Iraq. The atmosphere of the schools is politically and morally corrupt: the educational standard is appallingly low. I imagine that in present circumstances the movements of external pupils will be largely restricted. At the same time I suggest the desirability of informing the Governments of the various countries concerned that every obstacle should be places in the way of pupils coming to Iraq. 1 know that such steps were taken some time ago by the Governor of Aden. 3. I have instructed a member of my staff of establish contact with these Arab pupils in order to keep them as far as possible on the right lines during the time that they are cut off from their own countries. 4. The Iraq Government are responsible for their education and for their keep. They also give a small sum of pocket money to each pupil - about 5/- a month. This sum should be supple mented, and usually is, by remittances from relations. In present circumstances many of the pupils are cut off from comaunication with their homes. All are fit and well at present, but if necessity arises i will see that none of them becomes destitute. 5* I am sending copies of this letter to Sir Harold McMichael, Sir Miles Lampson and air Hathom Hall.

I was received most cordially by all whom I met. I was given access to all sources of information and was allowed to inspect every aspect of the school organisation unaccompanied, if I desired, so that I was not hampered or disturbed by well-meaning guides. A car was put at my disposal by Shaixh Abdullah Jabar. The school terra began on the 17th October and reg istration of new pupils was complete so that I was able to see the school under normal conditions. 1. The DIRECTORATE . a « donstituuion. The Directorate consists of 3 officials and an Advisory Committee viz: Rais Al Maaref . (Head of the Department), and Chairman of the dommittee, Shaikh Abdullah Jabar Subah of Kuwait. Mudlr Al Maaref . (Director of Education) Abdul La til* Jhimlan of Bahrain.-2 ?mdir Al TQleem &gt; (Director or Studies), and Head Vaster of the VubarakTeh School. ?;amel Bia v asli of Syria. Veitbera of the Pouanl11ee . ihai;ih Yusuf Al f anam. ?hisf Al Yusuf. Abdul Mohsen Khorafi. Yusuf Abdul Razaq. Ahmad Al Kushari. Abdullah Zaid. Abdul Hamid Al Sana. With the exception of Abdul Haidd who works in the Customs Office all the Committee members are prominent merchants. They have no educational qualifications. This Committee meets at irregular intervals when occasion demands. It controls all fin ancial matters, engagement or dismissal of staff, expulsions of pupils, and matters of policy. b. The Rais Al Vaaref. Shaixh Abdullah seems deeply interested in the school and is conversant with what is goifcring on. He is handicapped by his lack of experience of school organisation. It will be a very excellent thing if he is able to avail himself of the offer of the British Council and visit the Soudan where he will be able to study an efficient, modern educational system. c. The Kudir Al Maaref. n ■ r ■ lm i in ■ ifr-_i- _ r n m-i The real driving po~**er should come from the Director of Education. He should be a man versed in educational ways end should have a comprehensive knowledge of all that goes on in the schools, and should be in close toueh with the views of the general public. He is the Chief Inspector. Not only should he inspect but he should see that his recommendations «re carried out. Abdul Latif Shamlan lacks these qualifications. He was unable to give me reliable information even about matters as simple as the number of classes in the school beneath his olfice His figures for staff were also faulty. In all cases it was necessary for me to check personally any information that he cave. Since his return from his visit to Zpyot he has adopted European dress* This has been a cause of considerable criticism. I recommend that, if a suitable man can be found, ne be replaced at once. Unfortunately I an not In a position to recommend anyone for the post. d. The Director of Studies . Kernel Effendi is a Syrian from the Bar Al Maalemin, Halib, with 11 years teaching experience. He was engaged at the begin- ing of the school year. He is a good teacher and appears efficient and energetic. What authority he has over the other Head Masters is not clear. _ „ , .. I recoanond that there be a monthly meeting of Head .as ters under his chairmanship to arrange details of the syllabus, time-tables, other questions of internal organisation and to exchange views generally. This is valuable in two ways: It leads to a unification of the work in all schools. It tends to overcome feelings of Jealousy between the Head Masters which are so frequently a serious brake on progress.2* Sohool Statlsclos , Town Schools, Boys* 4.

A copy of the budget for the year 1360 is attached. The position would be far more satisfactory if the ajaom amount allocated for Education be fixed beforehand so that arrangements for a complete school year could be undertaken in advance. 4. TO /N BOYS* SCHOOLS . a. Staff. At the end of last term uhe salaries of the Palestinian teachers were cut by 15# in order to maxe them resign. Two of them did so. The reason for this action was that the Egyptian Grovernment is willing to subsidise their teachers who are working abroad. The Director of Education went to Egypt recently and through the Minister of Education in Cairo engaged 4 men for Kuwait. Half their salaries are paid by the Egyptian Govern ment. They describe themselves as an w Egyptian Mission’.* This action was taken without any reference to the Political Agent or me. All four are graduates with teaching diplomas and have had several years of experience. They will be a very useful addition to the teaching staff. Originally they applied to be sent to Iraq on the ex change system which operates between the two countries. They were given only a few days notice by the Egyptian Authorities and ordered to leave for Kuwait. Their only alternative was dismissal. Three of them are married men with children. They have left their families in Egypt. Two Syrians have also been engaged this term as Head Masters of the Mubaraxieh and Sharqieh Schools. Both are well qualified and experienced teachers. One is a married man with a family in Syria. The usefulness of the men will depend largely on the conditions under which they live. In the evenings they have too much time on their hands and no places of recreation. A club for school masters should be started up at once. We have several such clubs in Bahrain. The main features are a library magazines, games such as Ping Pong, Chess etc., a radio and where space permits Volley Ball, Tennis etc*. Lectures» deb ates and plays are organised within the club. b. Standard of Teaching . Many of the local staff have been recruited from the Secondary School. Their knowledge is therefore limited and their ideas of teaching methods primitive. It is tnerefore essential for these new qualified teachers to give demonstrat ion lessons and lectures on teaching aims and methods for the benefit of the local men. These should be arranged reg ularly. 3 main points emerge: 1. The only method used in all subjects is that of learning by heart. This is true of subjects differing as widely as Arithmetic end English. 2. Due to this method the recognition of the relation ship between what is taught and the experience of the pupils (whether in or out of school) is completely lacking. 3. Insufficient opportunity is given to the pupils to do things, to work things out for themselves. These methods intensify: the habit of not exercising-5 imagination, the inability to apply knowledge under novel circumstances and the inclination to sit and watch while others work. A copy of a detailed analysis of teaching met hods used in the schools is attached, together with correct ive instructions. These are to be distributed to members of the staff. The teaching in the Kindergarten classes in many cases is very good. This is done mostly by local teachers, some of whom were trained in Iraq. The 'born' teachers should be given the lower classes while those of highest qualifications, the upper. c. syllabus .

Further questions showed that there is no real understanding of the content of the answers. Arabic . Teachers rarely question the boy after giving a lesson and consequently assume that they understand far more than they do. Generally the standard is fair. Arithmetic. Never once during my visit did I see a class engaged in working out examples on paper or on slates. Sach lesson one boy does an example or two on the board while the remainder of the class watch (or doze). The consequence is that when they are examined i&amp; is almost the first time that they htive put pen to paper and the results are very poor indeed. They can rarely set about the problem and when they do they are slow, inaccurate and untidy. English . The standard is very low indeed, owing to the very poor teaching. The present method id for the pupils to learn by heart certain questions and answers, with the Arabic trans lations sandwiched between. A question in English produces either the translation in Arabic or a prepared answer not applicable to the situation. This must be changed through the example of the Egyptian £ g ^ q 3 r S • The book in use is the Oxford Reader. As the Egyptians have been trained to teach Longman*s New Method series I- 6 - recommend that the boohs be changed. In many ways the New Method is superior to the Oxford series. Chemistry . It is too early to express an opinion as these classes have only been started a few weeks. The apparatus is scanty and poor. Drawing . The boys invariably copy bad drawings from the board. 1 The subjects chosen are sea shells, a door, a book, a box, a house, etc,, all of which are available as first hand models. The results are very poor as copies and useless as a means of self expression. e. Text Books . Religion Arabic Readers History Geography Arithmetic English Songs. f. Apparatus . From Egypt ' Syria &amp; Egypt rt Iraq rt Syria None used except by teachers. These Oxford Readers (are various. From Iraq. In each school there are a few pieces of apparatus for the teaching of Arithmetic. Thisc should be pooled and complete sets made for each school. It is simple to construct and can be made by the staff or in the hand work lessons of the upper classes. Local carpenters can also help. Maps, charts, models etc., are badly needed for all schools. Certain of the Head Masters are already making some. Such activities should be a regular feature of Geography lessons. - g&lt; Buildings . During the past year two excellent schools have been built to rehouse the Ahaadieh and the Sharqieh Schools. It is hoped to rebuild the Qublieh this year. This will mean that all the four town schools will be in good buildings designed as schools. h. Health . There is no regular school inspection. Boys who are very obviously ill are sent to a special doctor. V/hen I point ed out very bad cases of Trachoma I was always told that the boy would be sent for treatment 'Tomorrow'. I can not quote figures but the percentage of bad eyes is high. The major ailments appear to be eyes, sores and head diseases. A much more satisfactory system is for the doctor to visit each of the schools once a week. In Bahrain the Schools* Doctor visits each of the schools twice a week, there being a small dispensary at each school. The general health of the school boys has Improved considerably during the past 18 months because of this. An annual record of Weights, Heights and Chest Measurements is also kept. ^ Scouting and Games . Each of the four town schools has its troop of Boy Scouts I had little time to see much of their activities. They appear to concentrate chiefly on drill and marching. There do not appear to be any organised games. There are no regular inter school football or volley ball matches.-7- 5. Village Schools . (Boys). The curriculum is limited to the study of the Qoran, Religion, Reading and Writing in Arabic and Arithmetic. This is as it should be. The standard depends en&amp;irely on the master and there fore varies considerably from school to school. As many of the villages are isolated the teacher must be an inhabitant. For this reason it is difficult to suggest how improvement can be achieved. I was unable to visit what I am told is the best of these schools, on the island of Feilajeh, owing to bad weather, but of the seven others that I visited three were outstanding: viz: Al Jahrah, A1 Dimna and Al Sha’abeh. In these three schools the teachers are from Kuwait. The organisation is good and the work comparable to that of the lower primary classes of the town school* The thre schools of Al Howali, Al Buhleifeh and Al Fantas were particularly bad. Even in Religion, the one sub ject that one would expect to be taught well, the pupils were apallingly ignorant. Al Howali is His Highness* own village and two of his sons attend the school. It is also the nearest of these schools to Kuwait. It is therefore rei-arkable that a good man from Kuwait has not been found particularly as the salary of Rs.37 is far in excess of the usual salary of U.22 for village teachers. I recommend the following changes in salary: Present Salary Revised Salary Al Dimna 29 30 Al Sha’abeh 22 30 Al Jahrah (1) 39 40 Al Jahrah (2) 22 22 Al Jfaheil 22 22 Or replace Al Buhleifeh 37 22 -do- Al Howali 34 22 -do- Al Fantas Al Feilajeh Not visited -■ All these schools are in dire need of Arabic Books. I suggest that these teachers be brought into Kuwait occasionally, to learn what good teaching is. 6. GIRLS* SCHOOLS. I visited the Girls’ Schools after school hours. The buildings are all converted dwelling houses and as such are most unsuitable. In some cases the only light is from the door and a small hole in the roof. New buildings are urgently needed. The Head Mistress of the Mutawasatch School is also Inspectress. She gave me the following figures: Al Mutawasatch Al Sharqieh Al ^ublieh 7 teachers. 6 Syrian &amp; 1 Kuwaiti. 5 -do- 4 -do- 1 -do- 2 -do- Both Syrians. Syllabus .

They have offered their own boy a Job with rood prospects but he prefers c 'Oet-Rioh-Quiok' job wit the Americans as an interpreter. All five hope to find jobs locally. The K.0.1. originally intended to send 10 boys to Bah rain this year but have cut down the number to five as they are now closing down.

General. The number of highly educated men for whom Jobs can oe found in Kuwait is, and will be for some years to come, very limited. The addition of classes to the Secondary School is therefore not desirable. Attention should be paid to the ?*ai«»inr of the standard in the existing classes, '.'hen this has been achieved those Kuwaitis who wish to continue their studies nay do so in Cairo, Damascus or to other centres deemed suitable. . Throu^hK^he schools the emphasis should not uc so nuc^ on the acquisition of factual knowledge but on the builu-ng un an attitude to life. 3uch ideas as that of .manual labour being degrading or that in disaster intensive effort ^ useless, because God is Great and the calamity is inevitable, must eventually be eliminated. * 4 w . Continual war should be waged against what v«.-«i*uie which accepts everything without question, without consider ing cause and effect.

Phrases learnt oarrot fashion, whether religious, historoial, geographical or mathematical are of no real value unless the meaning is thoroughly understood. The following examples illustrate this: - RELIGION: A boy was unable to name a prophet other than Mohammad; Vel He could give the date 570 A.D. without Knowing from tfhose birthday the years were counted, mother boy when aGXad how many 'corners* there are of the Faith of Islam replied -S* when asked to state them he recited the times of prayer. OSOGR/U/HY: A teacher explaining the difference in time between planes oT differing latitude, began with the statement that 15 decrees 3ast or test meant a change of 1 hour. ; e explain vhy this was so. Consequently the pupils found this tact very hard to memorise. ENGLISH: The class learnt the following # by heart:- C-T-A-N-D-U-P stand up GOM ( ) by repeating it many, many times. ?hen told to stand up they lid not know what to lo. HYGI3N2: (1) \fter a lesson on the spreading of disease by dirty habits a boy walked to the window and spat on to tne verandah. The master did not correct him. Ii he .iad really understood his lesson and not learnt by heart 'I imivSt not spit'* he would never have done this* (2) ifter a lesson on the position of the heart, lungs, stomach etc. using a cnart with the class calling out in chorous the names of parts indicated, only one ooy could show me where his own heart was. (2) It is not sufficient for a teacher to give his lesson and assume that the boys have learnt it. It is necessary by persistent and varied questioning to make sure that each boy has understood. In each lesson where new material is being put oe:ore -ne class the teacher must first make sure that the previous work has been remembered. This is best done by questions. Tte.ore the end of the lesson a similar process should be gone through, forlowed by a brief summary of the new material. ^ ^ „ Many teachers complain that this will mean slow progroso. Remember that slow progress is better than no prog-ess. Because lesson has been read or heard it does not mean that it has oeen learnt or understood. % _ , . , * e.g. In a Kindergarten Class ( ) ^ ^ being taught by the usual cnorous method from letter on one oo ra. - 'BA-BA-TA• ohoroused the children, /hen I ooIntel to the ( ^ ) with my finger and asked what it was no one could tell me. They appeared to kno* it but a simple question showed that they did not. They had learnt the word as a whole failing to recognise each separate letter. In jfc Geography the class spent two successive lessons copying definitions from the board. Not once were they questioned to see if they knew them. Not once were they asked to give examples (best of all local ones) to illustrate each. 3uch questions as '/here is the nearest river? nearest island? nearest delta? etc. 'tfhy are there no deltas in Kuwait?' help ihe deiiniuions in their minds*. (3) Insufficient work is done by the boys themselves. This is n^rticularly so in Arithmetic and Dictation. Not once luring my inspection did I see Arithmetic being done by pupils °n pajaror slates. This means that at examination time it is the lirst tinetaat put pen to paper and tna result Is til t they are rarjly a^ble to attempt the prohleia arvi tnat they do the irortc Is slow, inaccurate and untidy. In Arithmetic when giving a new lesson foliov this method:- 1, Explain what the problem is, 2. Woric out two or three on the board yourself with explanation# 3# let one of the class try one on the board# If he finds difficulty asic for help from the class# 4# Repeat this with another boy# 5# Make all tne class try one example. 6. 'hen they find a difficulty 3ay*Pens down* and work it out to that stage, explain the next step and let them try again# Thus step by step let them complete it on the board# 7. Put another on the board and repeat tnis process# Do this until the majority can solve them# 8# Now write up ten or twelve - enough to koep even the best boys busy - while you go round helping the dull boys# &gt;11 dictation must be done by the whole olass on paper or slates# ISon’t take it too fast# Tatch the slowest boy and give all a chance. This method means that all the olass work whereas before only one out of 30 or 40 was working# (4) Always emphasise the relation between what a child snows and the new material that you are giving him# Also between what the child s^es outside school and what he is learning. Teach a child to oount with stones, desks, boys, windows etc# give him problems about sheets, sheep, marbles, 'balsas' etc# In drawing lessons give actual natural objects and not copies of other drawings Let them occasionally draw natural scenes familiar to them - the sea shore, shipping, the school room and, if religious scruples permit, one another. In the colouring of geometrical designs 1st them chose their own colours instead of directing them to copy what is on the board# In Geography go for imaginary journeys - Kuwait to India, Kuwait to Cairo etc. Name the countries and towns en route, the types of country, the xinds of people, the means of travel# nth all subjects show the relation between each so that they appear as one aspect of the life of man# Chow that the lines of latitude are numbered from 0* 360 because there are 360 degrees in a circle as learnt in geometry. Drawing can be used to illustrate History, Geography - in fact nearly all lessons# (5) Plan your lessons to fit the time given# In some cases I saw teachers continue their lessons 10-15 minutes beyond the allotted time# Others stopped short and did not know what to do next# Don*t try and give too much at a time# Teach a little and drive it home with continuous but varied questions# (6) Each school appears to have some jander^arten apparatus but no school has a complete outfit# The following are necessary:- (a) Cards at least 4' X 8' with letters, numbers and arithmetical signs# These should have hooks or holes so that they can be hung on the board. (To be found at Sharglah Softool) (b) Sheets of card with pictures of well known things on them with the number at the side e.g. six cats, five oranges, 2 men etc# (To be found in Shargiah School) (o) Pieces of wood with the letters and numbers cut out of them (To be found in 'Aibarrakia School)# (d) Blocks of wood and bead racks and pieces of board with holes and corks for counting. (To be found in Kub^rrakia) # (e) Bars of wood marked off in cubes for teaching fractions# (To be found in Mubarrakia School)# (f) Multiplication boards. These are boards 9' X 12* with teh/ten ro*s of ten holes ench in .vhioh a^rDles may rest. 'lumbers from 1 to 10 ^re written above the top roj snd ao^rn the right hand aide. Using this a child can work out its o*n miltiplioation tables from 2 to 10. (g) Large pictures to iHastate stories. The best Kindergarten work is done by: Saleh Abdul Malek and Jasia Mashary of the Hubarrakia. Vbdul ^ziz al Noori of the ^ublieh. \li ^asim Hamad and Abdullah Abdul Latif of tiie ^Jharglah School, It rouli be an excellent thing for other Kindergarten teaohers to study their methods. (7) The English teaching in the Primary classes (with the exception of the hmadieh School) is very poor. It is useless to learn xahrases and their Arabic translation without applying them. 3arly lessons are best taught without the book - when you see that the meaning is grasped let taem then read the lesson, j?,B , Do not give the Arabic translation first unless absolutely necessary, Establish the direct relation between the English word and the object or action. Give plenty of time to silent reading. To test this ask questions with shut books, (8) Always bear in mind that, important as the acquisition of facts is, it is the mental habits that are developed in the process that will affect the child^s future life. In addition to the well knom desirable qualities of honesty, co-operation, punctuality etc. there are two which are most applicable to this country 1. 2 . The ability to apply knowledge in new situation? The desire to work oneself rather than stand aside and let others lo it for us.No. C/\05%' FOlitical Agency Kuwait November 18tb, 1942 From - Major T. Hicicinbotham, O.B.F., Political Agent, Pluv/ait. To ▼ The Hon^le the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain. Sir I have the honour to forward a copy of a report by Mr. F.J. Waicelin, Educational Adviser to Kuwait and Bahrain on his first inspection of the Kuwait Educational System and the Educational Establishments in the Arirate. Mr. Wakelin’s report is pleasantly short and refresh ingly clear in marKed contrast to other documents on the same subject which have appeared from time to time and his suggestions helpful and the proposed remidies practically possible. 2. I have but few comments to malce but certain sections call for some explanation and others for an expression of vi ews • Section 1 . I entirely agre . with Mr. Wakelin’s views regarding Abdul Latif Shamlan, and hope that it will be possible to find a suitable successor; possibly the Educational Adviser would maice enquiries through the British Council so that in the event of His Highness agreeing to 3haralan f s retirement we could suggest a good man to take his place. Section 4 . I was of course aware that the services of the Syrian teachers had in effect been dispensed with,and in fact it was I who first brought the action of the Educational Committee to the notice of His Highness,and I also knew that Shamlan had gone to Egypt to enlist new men but I was certainly/certainly not aware that approaches were being made to the Egyptian Educational Department until the teachers actually arrived in Kuwait and started to describe themselves as a 'llission'. I took the matter up with His Highness* Secretary who I am inclined to believe,was also officially not cognis ant of the exact status of these people and who handed to me a copy of their contract with the Kuwait Oovernroent in which there is no mention of their connection with an Egyptian Government Department. I did not take the matter up personally with His Highness as the ground was somewhat delicate but ^ I did have it brought to his notice that the Educational Committee’s action was to say the least discourteous to the Educational Adviser and short shighted in as much as they did not obtain the valuable assistance which the British Council could have afforded them in the selection of suitable teachers The members of the Educational Committee noted in Section 1 of Mr. Wakelin’s report are for the most part mildly anti-foreign in their sympathies and not particularly pro- Shaikh, in fact their senior member, old Shaikh Yusuf bin Isa is a double dealing bigoted old scoundrel with distinctly anti-British views and the leader of the Jenai Section of the Section 8. I trust that Mr. Wakelin will get in touch with the British Council and enlist their co-operation in keeping an eye on these lads in Egypt. Section 10 . I am having this report translated into Arabic for the information of His Highness and Shaikh Abdullah al Jabir, and I hope that they will take to heart Mr. Wakelin , s remarks in this section. His is a view of the type of the purpose of education in Arabia and for that matter other Eastern Countries with which I am in complete accord and town which does not support the present regime which to my regret I have but seldom heard put forward , Mr. Wakelin/-3 3* l!r. Wakelin will hiraself discuss t*]/© i-ore inportant points of his inspection report v/ith His Highness and with Shaikh A.bdullah al Jabir should the time at his disposal before the sailing of the next steamer for Bahrain permit.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to para 8 pf Mr V.'akelin's report on the Educational Department in Kuwait and to enclowe a copy of a letter which I have received from his Highness the Ruler. 2. Mr. -Yakelin has referred in his report to the visit to Egypt oaid by Abdul Latif Shamlan in search of new teachers and I have commented on the part played by the Kuwait Government in this affair in para 2 of my letter No.C/1038 dated November 18th. It seems that Shamlan made the arrangements referred to in His Highness* letter under reference while in Egypt in connection with the recruitment of the new teachers and that the arrangements were made withput the # authority or even the knowledge of the Ruler. It is possible that this is correct as far as His Highness is concerned but I have no doubt that the Educational authorities here were fully aware of Shamlan*s activities and it would not surprise me to learn that His Highness was also cognisant of what was going on and saw no harm in dealing direct with the Egyptian Educational Department.,and in fact probably enjoyeathe pleasant feeling of independance it gave him , for ne is childish in many ways, until my direct and forciful talks with his Secretary brought him back to a more proper understanding of his own position and round to the Agency to make a personal verbal explanation of the situa tion and some-what belatedly ask for advice. 3. Although ,as I have already indicated, I dis approve of the method adopted by the staler and the Kuwait Educational authorities in their dealings with the Egyptian Educational Department I do not see any political objection to the boys receiving a secondary education in Egypt provided some arrangements can be maae for the super vision of the boys when they are not in school and provided you see no oblection I suggest that Mr.Wake1in be asked to enquire from the British Council in Cairo if they would be prepared to undertake the general supervision of the ooys. If you agree I will inform His Highness that air mail enquiries are being made through the Educational Adviser and that it is suggested that the boys remain here, for the time being. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, i Major, Political Agent,Kuwait,E.DUCAX10^ KUWAIT. i The following is the translation of an article by Mr. F. J. A/akelin, Education adviser to Bahrain and Kuwait,published by'al-Bahrain' Newsoaoer. The Arab nation realized how inportant io the Education and how badly it is needed in all parts of the Arab world,so they worked hard to introduce it by means of establishing a good number of schools and by encouraging children to join those schools. They have already advan- ced a -'reat deal in this scheme. I had the chance of paying a visit to Kuwait in resoonse to the kind invitation of H.H. Shaikh Sir Ahmad al- Jabir as-Subah,Ruler of Kuwait. I have the pleasure of quoting a phrase of H.H.A/ith which he addressed me when I had the honour of paying him a visit,” You must not expect to see one of the Oxford Colleges in our d*ar country of Kuwait,as the Education program is still in its flrst stao-e.' But when I paid my first visit to the schools there,I was quite surnris^d at what I saw. The curriculum of the schools in Kuwait is 3 ?o that of any other advanced schoolo in the oth^er Arab countries The number of the pupils increiaes every year. There 11 0 boys and 330 girls in 15 schools. These schools can be deviled into Uo parts, a. Schools following the modern system of education. b.

I wish to inform Your Excellency that Abdul Latif Ash- Shamlan has been engaged as a teacher in Mubarrakia School and he was appointed later on as (Mudir al Ma’arif) Director of Education, as he was considered by the members of the Conmittee to be fit for the post. When some of the teachers resigned last w year, he travelled for the purpose of recruiting new school teachers from the neighbouring countries and he was not in possession of letters of recommendation or introduction and he was not an official who had the right of approaching any foreign G-overnment or any official committee as the Representative of the Kuwait G-overnment. Whatever he did, this individual did it on his own responsibility. No one in any Department of the Kuwait G-overnment have the right to approach any Department of the Foreign Government. This is regarding Abdul Latif Ash-Shamlan. Moreover, we consider all the teachers, whether being Egyptian or Syrian, as employees, who are paid for their services.

I suggest that enquiries be made to ascertain how lhamlan succeeded in imposing on the Egyptian Government in the way he appears to have done, and when this is known it be decided what action His Highness should be requested to take in regard to the man who on the face of it appears to have grossly exceeded his instructions and to be a most untiliable pe^on to hold a position as responsible as that at present held by him. regarding the communication from the Egyptian Government which forms an enclosure to Pritish Embassy, “1 * T Y»o/Cairo’s letter No, 2414/1/42, dated the 19th December, 1942, enclosed with this letter^I suggest that a reply be sent to the effect that Shamlan did not in any way represent the Kuvrait Government and had no authority whatsoever so to dojnor had he any authority to enter into any agreement with the Egyptian or any other Government on behalf of His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait or of any of the depart- ments of the Kuwait Govern-cent that the Kuwait Government y have entered into individual agreements with the under mentioned individuals to employ them as teachers for a period of one year at the rates stipulated against eacn person named: 1.

It is regrettable that the Kuwait Government did not dr-^w my attention to the fact that the schools were closed' until the 2nd of April but at the same time on consideration there seem to be some grounds for their possible view that their Educational \dviser who had been here as recently as November last year would have made himself aware of the school terms and holidays. 3. According to the terms of your agreement which is I presume much the same as your predecessor’s we are entitled to your services for a maximum period of one month in the school year. ?e have in fact had the benefit of your services for fifteen days in two and a half years. I must repeat what I indicated in my private letter that if you return immediately your visit will have been a waste of time.

I apologise most sincerely particularly as you had so kindly arranged a dinner party for me tomorrow night. There are two points raised in our conversations which I should like to mention again.The first concerns the boys who are going to Cairo. As the school year is so close it will not be advisable to send them until September. Until they have been examined by the Egyptian authoritiei it can not be known to whet schools they will be senh*There are special boarding schools in Cairo and Alexandria where they will no doubt live. ^ have written to the British Council in Cairo and they are ready to arrange supervision outside school hours,a very essential thing in a place like Cairo.I hope to be in Cairo myself at the time of their arrival. Perhaps you will be so good as to pass this information on to the Education Committee. Secondly it is necessary to fino. out at once if the Egyptian mastei intend to return next y«ar or not. It would be advisable to write to them asking for a definite answer within a stated time. I trust that my next visit will be longer and more fruitful.

The Honourable the Political Resident in the Per&amp;ian Gulf, BAHRA IN. Dear Sir, I enclose herewith the report on my recent visit to Kuwait. My stay, though short, was not entirely fruitless, as I hope my report will show, and 1 shall welcome an opportunity of discussing the matter with you. I have the honour t o be Sir, Tour obedient servant Sd • G.J. Wakelin. Director of Education. CONFIDENTIAL . Ifr.F.J.Wakelin*s Report on Education in Kuwait, March 1943. Owing to the neglect of the Kuwait Educational Authoriti' to inform the Political Agent that my second visit would coincide w* the Spring Vacation I arrived in Kuwait on Monday 22nd. March 1943 to find the schools closed until 3rd April and the Director and roost of the staff out of town. This Spring Vacation was mentioned# by my predecessor in his report (no copy of which is available in / Bahrain), but I assumed that the schools would be open as ample warning was given of the date of my intended visit. I discussed certain matters with the Political Agent, Shaikh Abdullah the Rais Al Ma*aref, Shimlan the Director of Education and Colonel Dickson of the Kuwait Oil Company. The results of these conversations are given below. Higher Education in Egypt . The 10 Kuwait Secondary Schoolboys^who were to have left for Cairo in November last are still in Kuwaft as the arrangements for their reception, accommodation and education were only of the sketchie st• As the school term in Egypt ends in June there would be little point in sending these boys at the present time. They should arrive in Cairo for the opening of the school year in September nexto We have no knowledge of the conditions under which these^ boys will live or to mhat extent they will be supervised,if at all, outside school hours.. I suggest that the British Council be approached and asked to assist us $n one of the following ways s \ &gt;, * (a) To arrange and pay for the education of these boys in Egypt so that we may be independent of the Egyptian Government. or (b) To ascertain from the Egyptian Education Department under what conditions these boys will live and study, and to undertake the supervision of the boys throughout their stay in Egypt. The Egyptian Government have in various places such as Cairo, Helwan, Alexandria etc. boarding schools for foreign students. I have no personal experience of theae but ae I hope to are nd mv .;.eave ». m Msna . L V• 2 • y* &gt; my aummer leave in Cairo I may have the opportunity of seeing what arrangements are made, I may also be there when the boys arrive. The Proposed Visit of the Rais Al lfa f aref to the Sudan • I understand that the British Council are ready at any time to renew their offer to a end Shaikh Abdullah Jabar on a visit to the Sudan, Iffr, Dundae thinks that it will be possible to arrange air priorities and therefore the visit should not take longer than six weeks, A suitable time would be in October of this year. The Replacement of the gudir Al Ma f aref , It will be necessary to find a replacement for Abdul Latif Shimlan as His Highness is dispensing with his services at the end of the school year, Ur, Dundae is ready to approach the Governments of Sgypt and Palestine and the American University of Beiruth, although in his opinion a reasonably qualified Uoslem educationist will be hard to find. There is one man, a British Syrian named Khoury, idao is working for the British Council in Cyprus who might be suitable but there is the objection that he is a Christian, It is essential that the ns?/ man have experience of an efficient educational system and keenness and energy tempered by patience and tact. Suggestlons Made in m y Former Report , 1(d), Head Masters* meetings are held only 'as occasion demands'^ Much benefit can be derived from a regular monthly meeting under the chairmanship of the Mudir Al Ma*aref or Mudir Al Ta t alim. The aim should be to introduce and maintain uniformity in the schools and to combat the rivalry and petty jealousies by demonstrating that in practice the pooling of ideas and experience leads to an all round improvement. This can only be successful if the Mudir himself is aloof from the usual intrigues and is working for the department and not for one particular school or party, 4(a), The suggested club for the staff has not yet come into being, as no suitable building can be found. This difficulty ( should not be insuperable. The British Council is ready to give assistance, when the club is running, in the formation of an English library and the supply of periodicals, 4(b), Regular night classes are now held for the localgfltaff by the four Egyptians and the Palestinian, The subjects dealt witl are the teaching of Arabic, English and Hygiene, Two lessons in each subject are given per week. The lecturers are paid Ra,40 per month and the classes are compulsory, 4(d), The English books at present in use are to be replaced at the beginning of the school year by Longmans* New Method Read ers, as the Egyptian staff have been trained in the use of this series. They are obtainable in Cairo, Bombay and possibly Bagh- dad. They should be ordered at once if they are to be ready by i October, 7, The Chief Local Representative of the Kuwait Oil Company assured me that the five trainees now studying in Bahrain at the i Government Technical School will be kept there until the end of * their course i,e, until June 1945, The Oil Company cannot however see their way to send further trainees until the Company opens up ; again, I pointed out once again that this was a very shortsighted / policy * ijfi- 3 policy as it takes at least three years training to make a fitter or machinist* The present trainees are doing well and the Bahrain Government is ready to accept 5 more should the Oil Company or the Government wish to send them* Annual Award for Proficiency in Bnglish * Mr. Mathe son. Manager of the imperial Bank of Iran in Kuwait, has intimated that the Bank would like to offer an annual award to encourage the study of Snglish in the schools* This would take the form of two prizes of Rs*75 and Bs«5C to be given to the first and second boys in Snglish in Class 2 of the Secondary School. Should this offer be made and accepted it will be necessary to see that the examination is a fair one* It may be necessary to hold it during one of my visits, preferably in the Spring. On Friday 26th March I spent the day at Fantas where the staff of the four town schools and the Scout Troop were in campc I discussed with the Head Masters and other teachers matters connected with the syllabus, the curriculum and teaching methods* The Iraq syllabus, which covers far too many subjects and far too much ground in each subject was at one time in use in Kuwait in its entirety. It is still the basis of the work in Kuwait but it has undergone modifications. Further alterations are being made which will bring it more into line with the syllabuses of Egypt, Syria and Palestine* I gathered from conversations with the Egyptian masters that some of them do not intend to return next year. It is the usual story of petty jealousy and the dread of cooperation in that it helps the other man as much as oneself* This trouble can never be completely overcome but it can mitigated the control of a strong and unbiased Director of Education. But whatever the cause and its cure a definite decision must be obtained from the four masters in order that replacements may be found if necessary. My original intention had been to stay in Kuwait from 4 2lst March until 4th April(or thereabouts according to transport arrangements), but as the schools do not reopen until 3rd April I should need to stay here for at least another week to inspect tlr schools* If one could depend on transport I should most certainly have done this but I feel that to lose the opportunity of a passage down to Bahrain on the E-Sang on Saturday 27th March may involve a stay in Kuwait longer than is permissible. 1 have therefore decided to return today if a passage is available.

I have the honour to refer to your telegram No. T/304, dated the 9th April, and to inform you that I did not tell Mr. Wakelin that the schools were closed for the spring holi days because I did not know that they were closed. 2. The Kuwait Goverament were kept fully informed of Mr. Wakelin^s programme and its subsequent amendments hut they did not see fit to acquaint me with the fact that the schools would he closed on his arrival. I have pointed out to them the inconvenience caused to Mr. Wakelin and they have express ed their regret. I have no douht that they assumed, and not without reason, that the Educational Adviser to the Kuwait Government would have been fully aware of the school holidays especially as he had so recently visited Kuwait. 3. Mr. Takelin arrived here on the 22nd of March and the schools reopened on the 3rd of April, that is eleven days after his arrival. When Mr. Wakelin informed me that the proposed to return to Bahrain by the steamer leaving here on the 27th of March I asked him to remain until after the schools had reopened but he stated that his presence in Bahrain was necessary in connection with a play and an athle tic meeting. I suggested that our claims should take prece dence over a theatrical entertainment and an athletic meeting pointing out that by the terms of his agreement we were enti tled to his services for a maximum period of a month a year and that we had in fact benefited by only fifteen days of his presence in the last two and a half years. My suggestion was not accepted and at an interview I had with him on the morning of the 27th of March he informed me that for family reasons he desired to return to Bahrain as soon as possible and did not wish to risk being delayed here. 4. It is true that Mr. Wakelin was not informed of the spring holidays and the responsibility for this neglect is accepted but it was Mr. Wakelin’s own conduct *hich made his visit of little practical use. I see no valid reason why he could not have spent three weeks here. The period before the schools opened could have been spent in consultation with the Director of Education and in visits to the Scout and Master*s camp where I feel much good could have been done. The period from the 3rd of April, when the schools reopened, to the 10th of April, when the s.s. •^osang' sailed for Bahrain could have been employed for the initiation of any teaching scheme which he had discussed with the masters, and for inspection purposes The risk of being delayed by lack of regular ship sailings is one which must be accepted by every one in war time and in my opinion should not be permitted to interfere with the efficient discharge of an Officials duties.

I enclose herewith -two copies 27th .March 1945. UO 2 7 /3 /^ of my report on Education in Kuwait compiled during my visit from monday 22nd.March to Saturday 27th.March 1943.

The iw^yptian Government have in various places such as Cairo^lelv/an, Alexandria etc. boarding schools for foreign students.! have no personal experience of these but as I hope to spend my summer leave in Cairo I raay have the opport'inity of seeing what arrangements are made.I may also be here when the boys arrive.

Much benefit can be derived from a regular monthly meeting under the chairmanship of the Mudir A1 Ma* aref or Mudir A1 Ta^lim.The aim shoula be to introduce and maintain uniformity in the schools and to combat the rivalry and petty jealousies by demonstrating that in practice the pooling of ideas and experience leads to an all round improvement.This can only be successful if the Mudir him self is aloof from the usual intrigues and is working for the department and not ior one particular school or party. 4(a).The suggested club for the staff has not yet come into being as no suitable building can be found.Thls difficulty should not be insuperable.The Brit3.sh Council is ready to give assistance,when the club is running, in the formation of an English library and the supply of periodicals. 4{b).Regular night classes are now held for the local staff bv the four Egyptians and the Pelestinian.The subjects dealt with are the teaching of Arabic,English and Hygiene.Tvo lessons in each sublect —\are given per wrek.The lecturers are paid Rs.40 per month and the cla ses are compulsory. 4(d).The English books at present in use are t6 be replaced at the beginning of the school year by Longmans* New Method Readers.as the Egyptian staff have been trained in the use of this series.They are obtainable in Cairo f Bombay and possibly Baghdad.They should be ordered at once if they are to be ready by October. ^ oa i. Rep F 3 ? n1;at iTe of the Kuwait Oil Company assured me that MPfeX the five trainees now studying in Bahrain at the Government Technical School will be kept there until the end of their course.i.e. until June 1945.The Oil Company can not hovever see their way oo send further trainees until the Company opens up again.I pointed out once again that this was e very shortsighted policy as it taJc ® at least three years training to make a fitter or machinist. Ihe present trainees are doing well and the Bahrain Government is ready to accept 5 more should the Oil Company or the Government ^wish to send them. Annual Awara for Proficiency in English . Mr.Matheson.Manager or the Imperial Bank of Iran in Kuwait.has intimated that the Bank would like to offer an annual award to encourage the study of English in the schools.This would take the form of two prizes of Rs.7b and Rs.50 to be given to the first and second boys in Mnglish in Class 2 of the Secondary School.Should this offer be made and accepted it will be necessary to see that the examination is a fair one.It may be necessary to hold it during one of my visits preferably in the Sprint. *On Friday 26th*March I spfjnt the day at Fantas vdiere the staff of the four town schools and the Scout Troop were in camp.I discussed with th 1 Head Masters and other teachers matters connected with the syllabus 9 the curriculum and teaching methods.Th&lt; Iraq syllabus f which covers far too many subjects and far too much ground in each subject was at one time in use in leuwait in its entirety.lt is still the basis of the work in Kuwait but it has undergone modifications.Furfcher alterations are being made which will bring it more into line with the syllabuses of Egypt t Syrie and Palestine. I gathered from conversations with the Egyptian masters that some of them do not intend to return next year.lt is the usual story of petty jealousy and the dread of cooperation in thfct it helps the other man as much as oneself .This trouble can never be com leteiy overcome but it can mitigated the control of a strong and unbiased Director of Education. But whatever the cause and its cure a definite decision must be obtained from the four masters in order that replacements may be found if necessary. My original Intention had been to stay in Kuwait from £Ist.March until 4th.April (or thereabouts according to tr*msport arrangements), but as the schools do not reopen until 3rd .April I should need to stay here for at least another w ek to inspect the schools .If one could .^-Npend on transport I should most certainly have done this but I feel that lose the opportunity of a passage down to Bahrein on the E-Sang on Saturday 27th.March may involve a stay in Kuwait longer than is penal sobl I have therefore decided to return today if a passage is avr liable.

To The Kon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. \ A) Sir, 1 have the honour to refer to your letter Io.c/38 dated February 28th 1943 to His Majesty’s AJubassador, ^airo. 2. His Hi ghness the Shaikh or Kuwait has informed iue that the teaohers who were recruit ^ r# returning to Egypt during this month on completionjlhe period of their contract. He understands that only four of then are prepared to return to Kuwait end that the Kuwait Educational Department are dispensing with the services of four other teaohers recruited from Dyria and Palestine thus -here vill be ei hit vacancies to be filled in the tutorial establishment before the reopening of the schools at the end of Depteiber. 3, The Kuwait Government are anxious to fill these vacancies from Egypt as their experience has shown that Egyptian teachers are more efficient end satisfactory than Palestinians or Syrians and His Highness has sought my advice in regard to the most appropriate and correct action to tr^ce. Naturally the Kuwait Government vould li*.e to obtain the new staff on the same terms as the present teachers were engaged. You will recollect that the Egyptian Oovernit ent in fact paid half the men’s salaries. I suggest therefore that the Egyptian Government be approached through His Majesty’s Embassy with a view to ascertaining whether they would be willing to continue the arrangement made last year. 4* Possibly ;fr• vakelln could be asited to examine this question and favour us with the benefit of his professional advice. It would be ideal if He could personally select the teachers in unit at.ion with •-he British Council ana the .Egyptian Government on his forthcoming visit to Egypt. 5. Should the Egyptian Government be unwilling to pay a percentage of the teachers salaries I request that the British Gouncil be asiced oo do so. They would then be in a position to send capable men here whose political opinions would be unlikely to cause His Highness or myself alarm and would at the sanetirae be rendering a service to Kuwait which would be appreciated \)y the3 Kuwait •Government and the people. 6. I enclose a ' - tope that this question can be lealt Uh as expe.H tiolssly as possible so that the teachers can a rive here in time for the reopening of the schools in Gsptei ber. How ihat his Highness has approached us it would be unfortunate if through ielay on our part the schools had to reopen with an inadequate staff.

My letter did not therefore recs the attention I had hoped.

I hope to be in Cairo early In July when I will immed iately take lip all these matters and can thus give you suae definite information about the schooling ox' the boys, the visit of Shaikh Abdulla to the Sudan and the possibility of the Council paying part of the salary of a fullt* qualified Director of ; ducat ion.

I take it that no financial ’contribution would be required from the Council in the curren^ financial year under the proposals ( contained in paragraph 6 ) that a .Iritish Council hostel should be set up in Egypt olf Beiruth (the only university in ''Palestine is the Hebrew University at Jerusalem, which is obviously un» •suitable) since no students would in fact benefit under this scheme until they had spent some years either in Bahrain or in Egypt undergoing a Secondary School course# The Council are as a matter of fact likely to establish a British Council students’ hostel in Beiruth by October this year in order to meet just such needs as you have 5.n mind. It is intended that this hostel should have a man of considerable seniority as its warden or president and that he should be assisted by a younger man who would live in close touch with the students. require the establishment of a similar hostel in Egypt -probably in Cairo- and as you will shortly be coming to Egypt yourself, it seems simplest to leave the detail^s of this new and important project for discussion on your arrival in Cairo in about a month# I would only say at this stage that the Council are in a condition of some financial stringency at the moment and that it is not quite certain that they would be able to finance any under taking on an ambitious scale before the next financial year. to the Sudan may be able to take place in the autumn.

The question of who should meet these charges has not been raised before. It was stipulated in paragraph 3 of Residency Express Letter C/b39 dated 7th October 1939 (copy to India Office under Printed Letter No.C/540 of same date) that these visits should not involve the Bahrain Government in any expense. They are likely to be less welcome to the Kuwait Government if that Govern ment is asked to meet their recurring expenditure par ticularly in view of the fact that the Lirector was originally proposed to be stationed at Kuwait. In these circumstances it seems reasonable that this expenditure should be met by the British Council and I should be glad if the Council could be approached to meet the chargee already incurred and similar charges in future. 4. The most convenient method of settlement would be that adopted for the six-monthly payments slreaoy made by the British Council;namely by payment by the Coupeil to the account of the Bahrain Government with the has tern Bank London.

Ihe qualifications I consider necessary are as follows: 1. A thorough knowledge of Arabic 2m A University degree or iis equivalent.^ 3. a beaching diploma. 4. Experience as ar schoclir.aster in both primary and secondary 5. Experience as a headmaster of a large school 6. Administrative experience 7 . His afe should be at least 30 years. The Director of Education Jerusalem was able to suggest two such men who are now working in is department. I interviewed one of them and vas impressed favourably. The other was out of Jerusalem at the time. The Director considers him to be a suitable man for the job also. Poth are la] estinian Moslems. In order to attract such a nan the Government will have to offer the following terms s {1. Secondment to the Kuwait Government a]A\ ps. l£ry of *400 per annum 3* Ah expatriation allowance of 25% 4• Free accommodation j. Return passage to Kuwait or its equivalent 6. Payment of 12^v8 of basic salary to the Department of Education, Jerusalem as contribution to the Pension Scheme as the candidates are pensionable officers. Until there is a competent Director in Kuwait no progress can be made. At present there is no unified system of education hut a group of schools run independently, frequently in o position to one another. There is no real control. Action is taken only in the most arbitrary The honble. the Political Resident, manner .. in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. schools epmanner, the notives being none often than not those of favouritism and personal gain. I depend largely on the Director of rducation for my i. formation, hat I saw during my own bore little relation to what I was told.

In an interview with iiinister of Education on nonday 14th September, he^tiforned me that not only would he have no objection to the El&gt;' r ^t Government paying the full fee®, should it wish to, 'bujn-frttat he would welcome such action* There still remains one man tobe engaged. He is Kamel Saleh /bdou. He has just taken the Certificate of the Institute of Education in Physical Training. . He submitted his name only yesterday so I have not had time to arrange for his secondment. I have interviewed him and consider him suitable. The Ministry is ready to send a Physical Training Instructorbut has been waiting for me to select one. The terms we offer are stated in a letter of Oth September to the other teachers, a copy of which is on the Koweit file. Would you please ask Ur. Highwood to arrange for this man to be engaged. He should be paid fE.25 for hi a tv salary for tho month of October. I will ask the Political. Agent at Koweit to forward £E.37 to you as early as possible. 2. A party of 11 Koweit school boys will be arriving soon to attend boarding schools in Cairo and I have asked the Political Agent to telegraph to the Council the date and time of their arrival so that the Ministry of Education may be informed. I suggest that Mr. Highwood should meet theta at the station together with the officials from the Ministry. One of the boys, Jabar Abdullah Jabar is to live at the Orman School and the other 10 either at the Saidia or the Helouan boarding schools. I have written to the Minister asking that all ten may be sent to Helouan as I consider it a more suitable plane. Their names are Ali /.aka*ia. Khalid al Jassar Khalid al Thuney/an Yusif si Shahid Abdul Aziz al Sarawi Mohammed al Fahid Abdul Razzag el Adwani Jasim al Mashari al Hassan Dawood al Musaad Ahmed al Arif an Accompanying the boys are four others whose names I do not know who have applied to be admitted to the Orman Primary Boarding school. I have written to the Minister about this but there has not been time for a reply. We shall appreciate it if Mr. Kighwood or some other member of the Council can keep in touch with the boys and report to us from timetime to time 3# There are three students studying at Al Azhar University one of whom, Abdul Aziz Hussein, is to join the Institute of Educrition* I have arranged with Kabbani Bey, the Dean that although he has no degree and cannot therefore obtain a certificate he may take the course and the examination. The Dean will then give him a letter stating that he has done this. All three are joining the British Evening Institute this tenn. The names of^ the other two are 2 - Abdul Latif Omar ed Adwani The Books Department has been most helpful over the purchase and despatch of books and stationery for the Bahrain schools. They have sent off several thousand all of which are essential for the progress of the schools. Also with Mr. Highwood f s help I have selected about two hundred Arabic books for the Bahrain library. These will be despatched in the near future. Yours sincerely. Sducational Adviser to Koweit i s The Representative in the Middle e,ast.

Financial Assistance from bhe British Council . I have discussed with .ir.Fetch, the British Council Representative in the Middle East and Professor Ifor Evans, Director of Education of the British Council, the possibility of grants to the Koweit Government for the following (a) Education of Koweit schoolboys abroad, (b) Part salary Oi» the Director of Education,Koweit. They were unable to promise anything for this year as exceptional demands have already been made upon their finances. They will, however, press London for allocations to the Gulf Area for the next year, although it is by no means certain that they will be forthcoming, as many requests already made, requests which they look upon as of real importance, have not been granted by the London office. 2. Further Education for Koweit Schoolboys . As the Council, is unable to undertake the financial responsibility for the eleven schoolboys whom the Government wish to send to Egypt, and there is no Council hostel in Cairo yet, I wished, before approaching the Egyptian ministry of Education, to investigate other possibilities. I therefore visited the Director of Education, Jerusalem and President Dodge of the American University, Beirut. There were no vacancies in Palestine and in Beirubh fees are about £150 per annum per boy which I presume is more than the Government wish to pay. The Council are opening a small hostel there this year but accommodation is limited to about fifteen. I visited a hostel in Cairo where three boys from Aden are living. Viz one of the Egyptian Government boarding schools, the Orman. As there were a number of boys in residence I was able to see under what conditions they live. The Matron is an English woman of middle age who has been there seven years. She appears efficient and sympathetically disposed towards the boys. The regulations are strict. No boy is allowed out without special permission and then not very frequently. The grounds are pleasantly situated and spacious. BeingBeing satisfied that boys living there would be well looked after, I made a formal application to the ministry for our boys to be accepted. I discussed the matter with Dr. Taha Bey Hussein, the Technical /.dviser. At first he was unwilling to accept any but Secondary Schoolboys. This would have eliminated Jabar Abdullar Jabar, whom I take to be the son of Sheikh Abdullah. I explained that were particularly anxious that the boy should have the best possible education and eventually he agreed to accept him also. The 10 Secondary schoolboys will attend the Saidia Boarding School, Giza and Jabar the Orman Primary Boarding School. I have seen the Saidia Hostel which is run on similar lines to the Orman. I have suggested to the Council that they nominate an English Matron for this school also and in addition a suitable Egyptian master or warden for each school. I believe that such assistance would be welcomed by the Egyptian Government. Meanwhile they are arranging for members of the Councilto keep in close touch with the boys and they will report to us fro i time to time. 3. Egyptian Teachers for oweit . I am, personally, in entire agreement with you that it is undesirable that the Egyptian Government should subsidise teachers in Koweit but to attempt to alter the existing arrangement i&amp; to risk grave complications. The difficulty arises from the action of the late Director of Education, who, without considering the political implications, accepted the Egyptian Ministry’s offer of four teachers, whose salaries were to be paid jointly by the Egyptian and Koweit Governments. When I first met the Minister he enquired after these teachers and informed me that he was ready to send more should we need them. I thanked him but made no definite reply as I was then uncertain of the position. It would be unwise to suggest that the British Council should take over the financial responsibility already accepted by the Egyptian Government. A course less likely to give offense would be for the Koweit Government to offer tc pay the full salaries. The British Council could then pay a grant to Koweit equivalent to the Egyptian contribution. Time however was short. It was doubtful whether the Council would allocate money this year anc 4rr.-e-^ it was by no means certain that a grunt would be available for next. A request to London could not be answered in less than three weeks. To persuade the Koweit Government to pay the full salaries without Council support would also take some time. The only course left open to me was to ask the Anistry for eight teachers on the same terms as before. This I did. One of the four original teachers, Ahmad Qaid did not wishwish to return as he has recently married, and the Koweit Government did not wish to re-engage iiohe ied Sayed A1 Ahl* We therefore selected six others. A few days later I received further instructions from Koweit asking for twelve teachers in all. This involved writing to the i inister again. He was then in Alexandria on leave. Theadvent of Ramadan further complicated matters but I was eventually able to find four more. At the last moment one of these declined to leatfe for Koweit. The Egyptian Government is paying half the salnry of ten of them. The eleventh, the teacher of Religion, is from Al Azhar. His full salary of £12 per mensem is to be paid by the Koweit Government. In my telegram of 30th August I infonned you that the teachers were asking for passages for wives and a bonus of £E.15 to assist them to return to Egypt on summer leave in 1944. As I had received no reply by 12th September I persuaded them all to go to Koweit where the terms of their contracts would be settled. I gave each a letter stating that he had been selected to go to Koweit where he would be offered a contract including the following terns :- la) A contract of two years (b) The Koweit Government will pay a monthly salc.ry of £E.12 (c) The Koweit Government will pay for a second-class passage from Egypt to Koweit at the beginning and from Koweit to Egypt at the end of the contract. (d) The Koweit Government will provide him with unfurnished quarters or an allowance in lieu thereof. (e) The Koweit Government will pay a cost-of-living allowance which may vary from time to time. I have paid £2.25 to each of the nine newly engaged teachers and £E.12 as advance salary for the month of October to all eleven. I enclose receipts for these sums, the total amount being £2.357. I telegraphed the Political Agent on 6th September asking him to authorise the British Council to loan me £400 sterling for this purpose. As I had received no reply by 12th September, I arranged v.ith the Representative for this loan and paid them. , j * • In my telegram of 6th September I said that the party would be leaving on 12th September. They were unable to do so because of difficulties in obtaining Syrian visas. They will leave at the earliest opportunity. 4. Director of Education . When in Jerusalem I interviewed two candidates for the post of Director of Education, both of whom had had some years’ experience in the Palestine Department of Education. In my letter......4 letter of 21st Ausust to the olitieal Agent, Kowelt, I set forth tne qual li icetione I consider necessary and the terras the Oovernraent should ofrer to ouch a men* Ae an alternative to a Palestinian I augmented that one of the Egyptians should be ???£ was delayed.

He trill therefore continue at /J AvZhar. Abdul Aziz has been taking English lessons at the British hvening Institute ( British Council ) for two years and has made good progress. The other two will also join him this October. I have asked the Director and his staff to pay special attention to them* At the Institute they not only study English but can attend lectures* debates* instructional film shows and entertainment and are free to use the library and club. I met .Ahmad Khrtfrrb. the Xoweit student In Beiruth. The Council are opening a hostel there in October which will be staffed by Englishmen. The purpose is to provide that discipline and guidance which is so saUy lacking at the University and to give them rn i sight to English Wi ys. At present the accommodation is limited but they are eeping a careful watch over all our boys at the University and ho;^e soon to have them all at the hostel. I have not yet had time to go to the University to make enquiries about the Faculty of Medicine, for Abdullah Mullah 1 s brother-in-law but hope to do so before I leave. it has not been eaey to settle these matters for apart from the normally involved routine of the Ministry of itducation further delays were caused by the absence of the Minister and many of the Officials concerned, on leave in Alexandria. Negotiations w^-nn slow rnd nrduous. Letters exchanged between Cairo and lexandria......Alexandria took several days and during the past month there have been several holidays when the Ministry was closed. Ramadan did not make thin~s easier. I trust that in s &gt;ite of all this the arrangements I have made are satisfactory. I will endeavour to visit Koweit early in November so that I may discuss any difficulties with the Political Agent, the Director and the Committee. I enclose a list of expenses incurred during this time. I remain. Sir, Yours faithfully, Director of (Education. Bahrain Government.

In ny letter of 21st August to the Political Agent, toweit I set forth the qualifications I consider necessary and the terms the Government should offer to such a man. As an alternative to a Palestinian I suggested that one of the Egyptians should toe appointed. The letter was delayed. As there was no reply toy 15th September, I telegraphed to Pales tine that I assumed the post was filled. I received a telegram later that day saying that Ali Haikal had been appoin ted#- I have discussed with him arrangements for the coming year. As he will toe unable to to reach Koweit before mid- October it will toe more profitable to make my visit early in November. 5 • Koweit Students at Al Azhar and Beirut University . On several occasions I met the three students who have been studying at Al A^har at the expense of the Koweit Government for the past four years. They are •- Abdul Aziz Hussein Yus if Abdul Latif Omar Arm&amp;d Adwani. I understand from them that arrangements have already been made for them tocontinue their studies for another two years. Abdul Aziz asked me to obtain his admission to the Higher Training College. This I tried to do but was un successful as his English is not suificnent. He will there fore continue at Al Azhar. Abdul Aziz has been taking English lessons at the British /- s.British Evening Institute (British Council) for two years and has uade good progress. The other two will also join him this October. I have asked the Director and his staff to pay special attention to them# At the Institute they not only study JSnglish but can attend lectures f debates, instruc tional film shows and entertainment and are free to use the library and club. ^ iaet Ah road Kha t tab . the Koweit student in Beirut. The Council are opening a hostel there in October which will be staffed by Englishmen. The purpose is to provide that disci pline and guidance which is so sadly lacking at the bniversity and to give them an insight to English ways. At present the accommodation is limited but they are keeping a c«reful watch over all our boys at the University and hope soon to have them all at the hostel. I have not yet had time to go to the University to make enquiries about the faculty of Medicine, for Abdullah Mullah’s brother-in-law but hope to do so before I leave. It has not been easy to settle these matters for apart from the normally involved routine of the Ministry of Education further delays were caused by the absence of the Minister and many of the officials concerned^ on leave in Alexandria. Negotiations were slow and arduous. Letters exchanged be tween Cairo and Alexandria took several days and during the past month there have been several holidays when the Ministry was closed. Ramadan did not make things easier. I trust that in spite of all this the arrangements I have made are satisfactory. I will endeavour to visit Koweit early in November so that I may aiscuss any aifficulties with the Political Agent, the Director and the Coranittee. I enclose a list of expenses incurred during this time. I remain. Sir, Yours faithfully, Sd. P.J. W&amp;kelin. ^Director of Education, Bahrain Government.

I visited resident Dodge of the American University, Beirut, where the Council are opening a Hostel in October, and the Director of Education in Palestine. In Beirut fees are about £150 per annum: in Jerusalem they are lower but there are no vacancies. ^ I have heard of an excellent hostel in Cairo run by a very efficient English woman where three boys from Aden are living. These boys were sent sortie years ago by a private mission school. y - Mr, Warrington of the Education Department, Aden, had visited it and recotnitended it. On further investigation I have found that this is the very hostel in which the Ministry have arranged for our boys to live. I visited it a few days ago. It was formerly a palace of Sultan Hu ssein. It is in Giza and stands in extensive grounds. The Matron, lire. Me 11 or has in her charge about 50 boys of ages between 15 and 19. They are not allowed outside the Grounds except with special permission. The food is excellent, and the accommodation spacious and there are u.any facilities for exercise, recreation and study. I am satisfied that under Mrs. Mellor’s care they will be very well looked after end Members of the Council will also keep in close touch with boys. The Technical Adviser at the University is writing a letter setting out the conditions in full. They will be as follows. l 9 The party will travel to Cairo at the expense of the Kuwait Government, where they will be met by officers of Ministry. 2.

It was formerly the practice to meet expenditure on the Functional Services of the Council, such as Music, Visual Publicity, Books and Periodicals, from what were known as Block Grants# These grants may have appeared to Representatives to be inexhaust ible in that it was almost always the case that supplementary demands on them were met readily and at once# J-t must be pointed out that this was due merely to the fact that many countries had been occupied by the enemy and were no longer open to the Council, so that considerable funds earmarked for them v/ere released for use in other areas in which the Council could still operate • This state of affairs no longer exists; the Council's work is now continually expanding into new areas; and the system of Block Grants has been altered. Starting with the present financial year, expenditure on Functional Services has been allocated country by country, both in the Local Functional Services of the numerous regional budgets, which show the expenditure #iich may be incurred locally , and also, as far as possible, in the budgets oF the various Departments, the amounts earmarked for expenditure in London for the various countries being shown, for information, on Forms ACL. It is unlike iy that additional funds will be available for Functional Services, and therefore expenditure on them must be strictly limited to the allocations for each country, unless prior approval of a supplementary allocation has been obtained through the Finance Division in London.
