That in the case of the Political Agent*s Court they were governed by the Bahrain Order-m-Council which had specilied certain Indian Acts as applicable to Bahrain (so lar as persons subject to the Bahrain Urder-m- Council were concerned) and tnat otherwise we should be guided by the law and customs m Bahrain.
