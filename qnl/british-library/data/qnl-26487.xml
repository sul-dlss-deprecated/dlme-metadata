Proposed Mission to India and Palestine . The Society for the protection of the interests of the Haramayn Wakfs are proposing to send a mission to Palestine, India and other places* Fuad Bey, in informing Sir Andrew Ryan of this mission, stated that its object was not to collect money, hut to urge the claims of the Yv r akfs on Governments and other interested parties. He further explained that the mission would not he official, hut would have the moral support of the Saudi Government, and he asked whether the British authorities in Palestine and India would grant the mission facilities. Sir Andrew Ryan expressed general sympathy hut suggested that the position between the Governments of the various countries and a private delegation might he ambiguous, and that the objects of the mission, however innocent, might he misinterpreted as being political. Sir Andrew Ryan is, however, of the opinion that it would he unwise to oppose the project, and as the Saudi Government has been showing unusual friendliness, he v/ishes to accommodate them in this question. In informing the Governments of Palestine and India he accordingly suggested that the mission might he received, provided the delegates were not personally undesirable. The High Commissioner for Palestine complied with Sir Andrew Ryan’s request on the condition suggested. The Government of India, however, feel that the reception of such a mission, even if -unofficial, might prove embarrassing both to the local Governments and the Indian States, and they therefore refuse to commit themselves to granting facilities until they have consulted An rtz local Governments and the leading Indian States. replies of/2 . - /Vo ' ^ &lt;u °f the various local Governments and States have not Jr*+&gt; l£*l‘ /i*** J -J' 4*t&gt;h yet 'been received, hut it would appear A that the majority will see no objection to the mission, provided that it confines itself to its avowed purpose. Insofar as the Wakfs are officially maintained by the Rulers, it might be preferable for communications to proceed cr i •j- *■ J'J 1 through the official channel^ but this view does not seem to be taken by the local Governments. Large sections of Moslem opinion in India are unfriendly to Ibn Saud, and consider that Indian pilgrims are exploited for the benefit of the Saudi Government. The present mission might, therefore, be regarded as a further attempt to secure financial advantages. This is probably another reason which is inducing the Government of India to proceed cautiously. Sir Andrew Ryan, on leaving his post last month, infoimed the Saudi Government that the Government of India had not yet been able to make a decision. He still feels that it would be unwise to oppose the project, and he has said that a refusal to leceive the mission might be held to conflict with the assurance given by Sir Lancelot Oliphant to Fuad Bey on May 9th, 1932. Sir Lancelot, on that occasion, stated that the Government of India could not interfere in religious matters. In reply to a statement by Fuad Bey that his Government might wish to send a delegation to India to make enquiries concerning the Haramayn Wakfs, Sir Lancelot said that no doubt such assistance as might be possible would be readily given by the India Office. This statement in itself can hardly be said to have committed the Government of India to the present missiontNDEXfF In any further communication on this subject, please quote No. \ address —not to any person by name, bhyto— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1.

I attach a copy of a note dated the 23rd May, 1935, hy the Denuty Superintendent of Police, Criminal Investigation Department. I agree with him that the importance of the Dargeh Khwaja Sahib would most probably attract the projected mission to Ajmer, but as the financial affairs of this Qaef are badly involved, the mission is not likely to obtain »ny success in its appeal for aid. I understand that none of the three Aukaf in Ajmer mages any contributions for the benefit of the Holy Places in the Heja^ and that the terms of the Aukaf make no provision for any such contribution. 3. In view of the fact that we had about six years ago, according to my information, a somewhat similar mission from Palestine, headed by the Gr^-nd Mufti of Palestine on a more or less similar errand viz., to collect subscriptions for the restoration of a mosoue in Jerusalem, it should, I think, be possible, without much difficulty, so far as Ajmer is concerned to prevent the object of the mission from being interpreted as political and to make it clear that the professed object is its real object, provided of course that the object of the mission is in reality innocent and non-political. 4. The Tonk State is also interested in this Proposed visit of a mission from Mecca for collecting funds from Aukaf in India for the bebefit of Holy places in Hejaz. matter1 natter but to what extent it is not possible to say; I believe there are several Aukaf there and the State ♦ possesses 4 Aukaf in Saudi Arabia (two in Mecca and Vide correspondence ending with RaIputana)two in Medina)o Agency Memorandum No*6520/39-Conf./§3, j dated the 10th October,1933 to the Politijlt is very cal Secretary to the Government of Indi^.j possible that the mission, if it comes, will desire to visit Tonk also: should it do so, I can see no objection provided that His Highness the Nawab accords suitable facilities.A ir Mp 11. Copy of note dated the 23rd May 1935, hy the Superintendent of Police, Criminal Investigation Department. There are three Y/aafs in Ajmer and they are as follov/s:- 1 • Dargah Khwaja Sahih. This is the most important Daof in India and its annual income comes to about a lac, besides a fixed amount paid annually by His Exalted Highness the Nizam of Hyderabad. However, it is stated that the treasury of the Waof is empty. 2. Dargah Miran ^ahib. Taragarh. The annual income of the Waof comes to about Rs. 10,000/-. It has been till late under the management of the Court of Wards and at present it is running under debt. 3. Chilla Bara pir Sahib. The annual income is about Es.2,000/-. The importance of No.l is likely to attract the Deputation to come here. In case it is decided to afford facilities to the Deputation, if and when it visits this place,I shall make necessary arrangements on receipts of orders in this connection. It is presumed that the Deputation will not meet with any success here. Sd. Mumtaz Hussain. 23 - 5 - 35. i * fGovernments and States concerned for their views. They may decline to receive Mission or grant any facilities and Government of India would then be placed in impossible situation if they had already agreed to visit even on terms suggested by you. Large sections of Moslem opinion in India are unfriendly to Ibn Baud and suspect that Indian pilgrims are exploited for benefit of Saudi Government, inquiry therefore under Ibn Baud's auspices into financial resources of Waqf institutions in India might well be regarded by Moslem opinion here as another attempt to secure financial advantages for himself rather than for Holy Places or Indian pilgrims. For this reason also Government of India feel bound to approach question with caution. The visit of Gr&amp;na Muf+i if not really analogous since it did not concern religious institutions in India but was merely intended to raise funis for Moslem University in Palestine to whi*h Indian Moslem opinion was in no wey hostile.

The views of the Muslim Member and Minister of this Government have been ascertained* Auqaf properties in the Punjab are in the hands of Pirs or Mutwallis, who consider themselves full owners of these properties, and frequently refuse to give any account of the expenditure of waqf money* The Pirs and Mutwallis would undoubtedly object to inter-* ference from outsiders, and might take advantage of the resentment which is still felt in certain quarters over the destruction of maqbaras in the Hedjaz. Though it is possible that the mission might be well received by the general public the Punjab Government believe that there is a feeling in certain quarters that foreign Muslims regard their Indian co-religionists as a milch cow and that the Muslims of India have earned very little gratitude for die money which they have from time to time sent to odier Islamic countries. 3. On the whole the Punjab Government are inclined to advise that, if this mission is permitted to come to India, it should come in an entirely un-official capacity* It should be granted only the ordinary passport facilities and should not be recommended by the Government of India to local Governments or by local Governments to leading Muslims.

The Saudi Government now ask in effect (Flag B) that the trustees of the waqf which is administered under a scheme* sanctioned by the High Court pf Rangoon should be restrained by the British authorities from remitting funds to persons in the Hejaz other than such as they themselves (the Saudi Government as represented by the ”Charities and Alms Committee”) may authorise to receive them. If you agree that the Legal position under Indian Law is as set forth in the Foreign Office letter below it will not be necessary I think to consult the Government of India who have had copies of all the correspondence before concurring in the views expressed by the Foreign Office. We should be grateful for your advice. I I agree generally with the views set out in the Foreign Office letter of 4th April - and do not think the Government of India need be further consulted.consulted. The position I think is as follows:- (1) The administration of the funds available is crystallised in the Scheme framed by the High Court in Rangoon. (2) Clause 6 and 8 of the Scheme confers on the trustees the duty and power of applying the income to the objects of the waqf. (3) There is in the Scheme no restriction on the channels by which the trustees are to carry out those objects. In other words, it is left to the discretion of the trustees. (4) Any control by the Saudi Government in the applications of the income can only be effective after the funds have arrived within their territorial jurisdiction, if they care to take action. The (5) Apart from (4) they can only act by obtaining an /t order on the trustees from the Rangoon Court on making out a proper case^ showing that it isy desirable in CjUl the interests of the waqf that the trustees 1 discretion in (3) slould be fettered as to the channel. (6) The procedure might be possibly by application in the suit in which the scheme was originally framed for variation of the scheme or possibly by suit under Section 92 of the Civil Procedure Code, or perhaps by application under the Administrator General’s Act if he still retains any interest in the funds. 1st May, 1934.Draft Paper.

Foreign Office. but to— “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, _ London, S.W.l. 4th April, 1921 S.W.l Sir, With reference to Foreign Office letter No. S 1428/71/25 of the 9th March and to previous correspondence regarding the Wakf of Ali ihn Huseyn Nanabhai, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit to you, to be laid before Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, the accompanying copy of a despatch from His Majesty's Minister at Jedda from which it appears that the Saudi Government desire that the administrators of this Wakf should be restrained from remitting funds to persons other than such as they may themselves authorise to receive them. 2. Sir John Simon is advised that, while the Saudi authorities are no doubt in a position to say that sums remitted to Saudi Arabia for the benefit of the poor of Mecca and Medina shall not be received or distributed except by the 'Charities and Alms Committee', and while they are in a position to enforce their edict by punishing any other person who received or distributed such sums, they have no power to compel persons who, like the Trustees of the Wakf in question, are not within their jurisdiction, to remit the money to the Committee. The only possible method of doing so would be, as Sir Andrew Ryan suggests, by means of an application to the appropriate courts in India or Burma, which might or might /not Under-Secretary of State, mdia Office Afc vnot succeed. The Saudi Government have certainly no right, in Sir John Simon ! s opinion, to call upon the Government of India to direct the Trustees as to what they are to do or not to do with the proceeds of the Ylakf and Sir John Simon assumes that the Indian executive authorities have no such power. 3. Under paragraph 6 of the Scheme for the Management of the Wakf which was sanctioned by the Indian Courts, a copy of which was enclosed in Mr. Laithwaite^ letter No. P.2.8133/32 of the 23rd December, 1933, to Mr. C.P.A. Warner, the Trustees are to apply two-thirds of the income for the relief of the poor in Mecca and Medina, but the method by which they are to carry out this provision is left to their decision. The matter, therefore, is really in the hands of the Trustees. If when the further communication, which the Saudi note of the 18th February, of which a copy is enclosed in Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch, seems to foreshadow, has been received and communicated to the Trustees, they are prepared to agree to the arrangements proposed in it, no difficulty will of course arise. If, on the other hand, they are not prepared to meet the wishes of the Saudi Government, the Indian Courts alone are in a position to compel the Trustees to do so, and if in the circumstances the Trustees feel a difficulty as to how to carry out the terms of the trust, they will presumably make an application to the Indian Courts for directions. 4. In Sir John Simon’s view, the Saudi Government cannot reasonably expect His Majesty’s Government or the Government of India to take any action in the matter /except(ypp(ijsjcuw*i^^ fey /ifoi) except to act as the channel of communications between the Saudi authorities and the Trustees of the Wakf. 5. Subject to the concurrence of Sir Samuel Hoare, Sir John Simon proposes to reply to Sir Andrew Ryan in the sense of the preceding paragraphs. 6. Since, as Sir Andrew Ryan points out, the question at issue has a general bearing on the administration of Wakfs created in British territory, a copy of this letter and its enclosures is being sent to the Colonial Office. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,no. 48. |Sk A (461/34/7) j 15 MAR &gt;554 j British Legation, Jedda. 20th February 1934* Sir, with reference to my despatch No.38 of February 10, I have the honour to forward herewith a translation of the unexpectedly prompt reply of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to my note of that date relative to the Vakf of All ibn Huseyn Nanabhai* Although the request contained in the ^audi note concerns primarily the Government of India it raises a question of principle» which deserves your attention all the more as other similar cases may arise elsewhere.,e*g. in Palestine* The Saudi Government ask in effect that the administrators of Wakfa created in British territory should be restrained by the British authorities from remitting funds to persons D to other than such as they themf• elves /tlay •SSXI receive them. It appears to me that the most that any British administrative authority could properly do - and there might well be objections in India to going even so far as this - would be to inform the administrates of the views of the Saudi Government without attempting to constrain them* If the administrators refused to be guided by those views, it would then, in my opinion, be open to the Saudi Government (a) to take action in their own domain against the distributors and/or (b) to endeavour Xss by action ta the proper British courts, /in The Fight Honourable, Sir John Simon, 0.0.8.I., K.G.V.O., etc* , etc. , etc*in this case presumably the High Court of Rangoon, to obtain an order to the administrators as to how monies should be remitted* The question might arise whether such action could be taken by the Saudi Government themselves or by some other applicant,e*g*, a poor person of Mecca or Medina but this, I take it, is a question for counsel’s opinion. 2* I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to the Governments of India, Bombay and Burma I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient. humble servant AWm % W RYANX of yov®lgn Affairs, Aeaea* 4th i$m*l t&amp;m* IBtn 1 &amp;&amp; 4 * 'tour ■ .xmll^rm^ » I har® ths homur to acknowledge the receipt of tour zmllrnmy* ® note ??o«SI(ST4/S4/4) dated IDth ^ebmarsr 1934, am to In.fo^ tour y&amp;conilem,^ that* while the 4#alra of the Cfo^on^ent of Ms Ita|#«t3r the ! lag la to study this matter mmfhll$r » l mm® ' [ t ym to fc# good to .notify the aattority aotteemad that there la for eueh ig|f» a special committee at mm® called w The Charities am Alas COKnlvtee” which, within -Urn scope of its has ouUiorlty to reeelv# that part of the imtm# of tJtmm &gt; Wfe shlch le hue to the ’ the 3 (i«^. # Meccfc- ^ ; axil to distribute it amongst ttei* This Committee did not grant to the persona who mm stated to have mmiwA the monism accruing tmm 'the income of the ' mqf of f .41i Ifen Haseyn Hsitslihal a*K I'lumti fomal authority entitling then to do anything in the xme of the people of the oly Places* Z therefore trust that wr-®% Is due to the poor of .Mecca and Medina free this laqf may he kept until mmh tins® mm the eetspetent authorities In the Ooverment of Ala Majesty thm ring have made suitable mrrmxiimmntB- to sem-ife these d^ies from simile or loss. 1 ith 2tlgh.es t respeete, ( ngmi ) ;, eysal* M* H* CB.

Respected Sir, As regards the above wakf,I am directed by the Board of Trustees to state as under. 2. The wakf is administered under a scheme which was sanctioned by the high Court of Rangoon in Civil 2 , Misc. case No .468 of 1927.A copy of elause^of the scheme providing who are to be the trustees is attached hereto for your convenience .All the present trustees are resi dents of Hander.In the suit above referred to it was agreed between the heirs and the other parties to the the suit that the trustees should be entitled to take payment of the l/3rd share of the state constituting the wakf by the transfer to them of shares in the Soorati Bara Bazar Company, Limited of Rangoon.This option received the approval of the Court.The trustees did in fact elect to receive shares and they now hold two hundred and sixty four shares in the above company. 3.The Trustees having been appointed by the High Court of Judicature are responsible for the administra tion of the trust in accordance with the orders of that Court and they do not understand how they can be called to account by the Arabian Government on whose behalf your letter under reply appears to be addressd to the Trustees. I therefore have the honour to make the following reply to your letter :- (1) A s tatement s howing regenu e and expenditure and reasons for the same . I have the honour to state that the trustees decline to furnish such a statement to any person other than those entitled to receive the same under the orders of the High-Court of Judicature at Rangoon. (2) Th e Propertie s of the _wakf.ijhavp the honour to - s tste that the Trustees are under no liability to furnish this information in reply to yoUr letter but as a matter of convenience 1 havealready done ao in the preceding paragraph.C.11/12 (3) Particulars r eg arding steps which can be taken the autho r ities conce rned in connection with the payment of the rights of the pe ople of A1 Hamayan .I have the honour to state that the trustees are entirely unaware of what steps can be taken by the authorities referred to. 3uch matters would appear to be peculiarly within the knowledge and dis cretion of the authorities having jurisdiction over the J persons resident in the sacred places and^venture to think r that your Honour is likely to be in a better position to form an opinion as to wa what those rights may be rather than my humble self. 4. It is also stated that the trustees pay to the rulers i.e., Raj ah s / from the wakf but I beg to inform you that the Trustees do not pay to any ruler. I have, etc ., 3d/- I.C.Hansia, By order of the Board of Trustees.Jio. 10088 -C/ 2 o. Revenue department a 'll y-jt Bombay Caatle,11th December 19^J3.

When the Hejazi Mission was in London in May 1932, we promised to give what assistance we could about the Wakf of one Ali Ihn Huseyn Nanabhai as Surati, who died in Java leaving property in Rangoon, one third of which was to be Wakf, of which Wakf one third each was to go tc the poor of Mecca and Medina* Various items of information about the Wakf have been collected and passed on to the Hejazis, (P.Z.4788/32), but there are still certain outstanding items, on which they have asked to be informed, which Sir A.Ryan has not yet succeeded in obtaining from the local Governments concerned - viz: Burma and Bombay (The Wakf is administered under a Scheme sanctioned by the High Court of Rangoon; the Trustees are resident in, and the remaining third of the Wakf belongs to Rander in Bombay). These items are: &gt; * (i) How are the remittances sent to the Hejaz? The information supplied by the Bombay Government was inadequate (P.Z.5342/32) and the Bombay Government seem to have overlooked Sir A.Ryan’s letter pointing this out: (ii) A statement showing revenue and expenditure and the reasons for the same. Both Local Governments state that the Trustees decline to furnish this save to persons entitled under the orders of the High Court at Rangoon. As Sir A.Ryan has now pointed out to the Government of Bombay, the Trustees are bound by the constitution of the Trust to post an abstract of the accounts at the Punchayat Office at Rander, and it should not be difficult, as an act of courtesy, to communicate it to him: (iii) Particulars regarding steps which canb e taken by the authorities concerned in connection with the 1712b 5000 3/33 payment/2*. payment of the rights of the people of al Haramain. Neither local Government is helpful on this. The Foreign Office ask if there is anything we can do to help. On the one hand it is desirable on general grounds to help the Saudis, as we promised, in what are reasonable requests and to avoid any suspicion that we are letting the trustees shelter behind us* (it is rather suspipious that apparently so far only Rs.32,000 have been remitted to the Hejaz; it seems possible that the trustees are appropriating an undue proportion of the Wakf for their native town). On the other hand (a) the proper place for a remedy is the High Court at Rangoon; (b) we have to consider our invariable policy of non-interference in religious matters, and we pointed .this out to the Hejazis in 1927 (Flag A), especially in regard to (iii) supra, cf*too P.3862/27. I am not sure that we can help in regard to (iii), but there seems no reason why we should not help the Hejazis to collect the facts they require under (i) &amp; (ii). A draft d.o. to the Government of India is therefore submitted, asking them to do what they can to promote a helpful attitude in the local Governments, at any rate as regards (i) &amp; (ii). A.F. MORLEY. 14.7.33. I agree that we might ask the Government of India for their assistance, at any rate as regards (i) &amp; (ii) but think it may be better to send a letter which can be passed on as it stands (if they wish to follow this course) to the Local Governments concerned. t4v 0 UJ I have therefore put up ;rnative draft*7z, mil ^3 Department. Major W.K.Fraser Tytler, G.M.G., M.G., Offg. For. Secy, to G. of I. 1712a 5000 3.3S ’v 1 9 JUL 193? My dear Fraser Tytler, I am desired to enclose copy of a private letter from the F.O. covering a letter from Ryan, on the subject of the Vfe q f of Ali ibn Huseyn Nanabhai as-Surati, which speaks for itself. 2. We realise the difficulties in connection with this case; and the importance of maintaining our general policy of non-interference in religious matters (you will remember that this was emphasised to the Hejazis when the question of Haramain Waqfs was raised by Ibn Saud in 1927 in connection with the Treaty of Jedda - see British Agency T s Note to the Hejazi M.F.A. N 0 .II 0711 / 50/25 of 4th December I 927 -)• On the other hand,we are anxious, firstly on general grounds, secondly in the interest of avoiding any suggestion that the trustees are sheltering behind Govt., or that we are adopting an unhelpful are attitude on such matters asA.essentially questions fact, to give the Hejazis any reasonable assistance in our power, more particularly in a case to which they clearly attach considerable importance. J. The main points still outstanding appear, from Ryan T s Despatch/Despatch No . 1469 / 280 /9 of 26 th May last to H.E. the Governor of Bombay (which was repeated to the G. of I.), to be (a) the channel through which the remittances are sent by the Trustees to the Hejaz (ct: in this connection Jedda Despatch No. 2550 / 780/19 of 5 th August 1932 to the Govt . of Bombay, to which no reply appears so far to have been sent). (b) the production of a statement Of revenue and expend iture and reasons for the same. (c) information as to the steps which can be taken by the authorities concerned in connection with the payment of the amounts applicable to the people of A1 Haramain, 4. The first of these points is a question of fact, and the answer it should not prima facie present serious difficulty. 9 . As regards the second, it appears from the Scheme (copy enclosed in Jedda Despatch No. 1469 / 280/9 dated 26 th May 1933&gt; which was repeated to the G. of I.) for the Management of this Waqf (clause// that the Trustees are under obligation to 'publish an abstract of the accounts kept by them once in every year by posting it at the Panchayat office at Rander, and such abstract shall contain the following particulars:- (a)/fS Draft Paper Department (a) the total amount of income received (h) the total amount of monies expended under appropriate heads.” (c) the balance in hand” on the assumption that the Trustees dB charge this obligation, it would seem prima facie that it should be possible, at any rate (as Ryan suggests) as a matter of courtesy, for the local Govt . to provide the requisite information for communication to the Hejazi Govt. 6 . The third Hejazi request is in rather a different category, and we recognise the difficulties which may be involved. But we shall at the same time be very glad to pass on to the P.O.-any observations regarding it which the G. of I. may feel in a position to offer. As regards the first and second the Govt, of Bombay and the Govt. of Burma may by now have replied direct to Jedda, but, should this by any chance not be the case, we should greatly appreciate any assistance the G. of I. and the local Govts, may feel that they are in a position to give - particularly in view of the importance which the Hejaz Govt, appear to attach to the question, and of the desirability on 1712a 5000 3.3a general/general grounds of giving them any reason able assistance which can without embarrassment be afforded in a matter such as the present.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your despatch No. 2257/781/13 of the 29th July, regarding Haramein Waqfs in Palestine and to inform you that there are two categories of Haramein Waqfs in Palestine. (a) Assigned tithes collected by Government and treated as Government revenue. (b) Certain properties in Jerusalem and Nablus the receipts of which are said to be assigned to Haramein Waqfs. These properties are administered direct by the Supreme Moslem Council who collect the revenue. 2. With regard to your suggestion that the Hejazi Government might profitably make use of private channels for the collection of information regarding these Waqfs, I can see no objection to this procedure. The Supreme Moslem Council is indeed the only oody in Palestine which could help the Hejazi Government to obtain particulars of the Waqfs described under (b). Once the claims are compiled, I am of opinion that they should be submitted through the official channels. It will be sufficient for the Hejazi Government to submit a list of the villages and the location of properties of which they claim the revenues.

I therefore request that Your excellency would be good enough to inform me of the authorities through which these payments were transmitted because the high Committee charged with distributing charities in the ■ejaz has hot received anything of this nature. Bhe deceased was residing at Java where he wrote a will. The Government have made several enquiries in Java nd Rangoon about this case and received Information which I wish to transmit to you herewith, hoping that it may be of use to you when the authorities concerned study the matter, I therefore hope to be excused for enclosing herewith copies of three documents, of which • c\which the first ia a letter from on© of the guardians in Java * the second is the report of the solicitor who was requested hy the Government to take charge of the case in Java and the third is an extract from the will of the deceased in question* As regards the Auqdf in Palestine and in accordance with Your Excellency’s advice to Sheykh Ydsuf YSsfn that you will enquire from General Wauehope about the method which can be followed before taking any other action, I will await your reply in this respect* With highest respects.

They would like to be able to give as definite a reply as possible (i.e. t something more than that enquiries will be made) because they have had to adopt a negative attitude on so many of the points raised by the Hejazis. The leading papers on the question of the Haramein wakfs will be found at the slips in the file below. There seems no harm in obtaining such information as to the present position of the property of Ali Surati as may be available to the Govt, of Burma. As regards Fuad Bey Hamza s second point, it will take more time to ascertain whether there is anything in his idea that some of the money sent by the Nizam to the Hejaz is the proceeds of wakfs. a,EXTRACT F5CM RECORD OR 2nd MEETING h'ITH HEJA2-KEJD DELEGATION uN MAY 9th, 1932. o In regard, to III. HARAMEIN WAXES. SIR L. OLYPHANT recalled that ning Abdul Aziz had made a similar request some years ago, and H.M.G* had given a written reply. I^e Government of India could not interfere in religious and quasi-religious matters, and there were no religious courts in India; but H.M.G. hat explained that if the Hejaz-Nejd Government wished, they could have recourse to civil courts, and had expressed readiness to consider sympathetically any request for assistance or advice. FUAD BEY HAMZA said that there were Haramein Wakfs administered by Gar ernment departments in Britisn-control3e d territory; e.g. (i) there were Wakfs in Palestine, administered by the Supreme Moslem Council; (ii) certain monies, sent by the Nyzam of Hyderabad, were distributed in the Hejaz. Fuad Bey seemed to thinh that these might be the proceeds of Wahfs; (iii) a certain Ali Surraty, (? Surati),probably an Indian, died in Java, leaving properties in Rangoon, of which the proceeds of one-third were to be devoted to the poor in Medina and Mecca. The Hajaz-Nejd Government had applied to the authorities in Java, who replied that they could do nothing in respect of the properties in Burma, and that applications had been made to the Administrator General of Trusts there. Nothing had been received by the Hejaz- ju ejd Government. Fuad Bey also said that his Government might wish to send a delegation to India to make enquiries sih/SIB L. CLIPHABT said that he would cause enquiries to be made regarding the specific cases which Fuad Bey had mentioned, and that no doubt such assistance as might be possible would be readily given by the India Office, e.g. they would probably be ready to advise the Hejaz-Nejd Grovernment as to the choice of legal representatives, if required.HARAHEI1! WAKPS. Among the questions which the Hejaz-Nejd Minister has told us in strict confidence that the Hejaz-Nejd Mission propose to raise during their impending visit is that of the Haramein Wakfs in British controlled countries. The Haramein Wakfs are Moslem pious foundations, the proceeds of which were intended by the founder to be devoted to the needs of the Moslem Holy Places. King Ibn Saud put forv^ard to the late Sir G. Clayton in 1927 three specific requests on this subject. He asked for: (a) information as to what Haramein Wakfs existed in India, (b) advice as to the proper steps to take with a view to preferring and establishing such claims as he might wish to make, (c) the normal measure of guidance and assistance to any delegation which he might send to India or elsewhere for the purpose of making enquiries and preferring claims. The reply of His Majesty’s Government was conveyed in a note of the 4th December 1927, a copy of which is attached. Fuad Bey Hamza reverted to the matter generally in conversation with Sir A.Ryan in June 1931 and Sir A.Ryan then referred him to the reply given in 1927, pointing out that our attitude in the matter was necessarily bound by our invariable policy of non-interference in religious matters. If the subject is raised by the Mission, we can only maintain the same attitude while expressing readiness to i consider whether any assistance or advice can be given in connexion with aspects of the matter, which do not involve interference in matters of religion.No.1107 M. T307S5) BRITISH .-xGiCHCY, JEDDAH. 4th December,1927. Your Excellency, After compliments, I am directed by His Britannic Majesty 1 s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign affairs to refer to the question of Haramain Waqfs which, as Your Excellency is aware, was raised during the conversations betweenHis Majesty the King and Sir Gilbert Clayton and to inform Your Excellency that His Britannic Majesty’s Government have now reconsidered this question in the light of the explan-; tions given by His Majesty to Sir Gilbert Clayton and, of the three specific requests put forward by him, which as Your Excellency is aware, were for: (a) Information as to what Awqaf-el-Haramain existed in India. (b) Advice as to the proper steps to take with a view to preferring and establishing such claims as he might wish to make. (c) The normal measure of guidance and assistance to any delegation which he might decide to send to India, or elsewhere, for the purpose of making enquiries and preferring claims. I am accordingly to request that Your Excellency will be so good as to inform His Majesty that His Britannic Majesty’s Government regret that since it is their invariable principle never to interfere in religious matters or in the decisions of religious or civil Courts, they cannot give him any promise of future His Excellency The Minister for Foreign Affairs, MECCA. assistance(?&amp;:'■ assistance in the matter of Haramain W,aqfs. Subject to this reservation, however, His Majesty may rest assured | that His Britannic Majesty's Government will in this 1 matter, as in others, always be ready to consider I sympathetically any request which he may maJ:e for assistance or advice, as regards His Majesty's three specific requests, His Britannic Majesty's Government regret that it is impossible for them to undertake themselves the collection of information as to what Haramain Waqfs exist in territories under their control, since such action would certainly be interpreted by Moslem opinion in some of -chose territories as Government intervention on one side in a dispute which ex hypothesi is sub-judica ;and the same difficulty arises to some extent as regards the two other requests formulated by His Majesty. So far as India is concerned, the law does not recognise religious courts, but the Civil Courts are open to all alike, and His Majesty can rest assured that if he decides to resort to litigation through his legal representatives in India, no obstacle will be placed in his way.
