A simple head with pellet eyes rises from one side and a short stubby tail flares out on the opposite side. The columnar base of the vessel is the mouth by which the vessel is filled. The walls of the base continue upward within the vessel forming a sort of interior well or dam. When the vessel, which must be inverted to be filled, is turned upright the liquid remains inside without a plug in the base. An opening in the beak serves as a spout from which the liquid may be poured. The sides of the vessel are incised to suggest wings while a series of regular gouges on the back indicates feathers. The beak and eyes are painted and a stripe runs over the head and down the neck to the back. Painted streaks parallel the gouges on the back, and the incised lines of the wings are also painted.", "medium": "Clay, slip", "dimensions": "7 1/16 x 10 1/4 x 4 15/16 in.
