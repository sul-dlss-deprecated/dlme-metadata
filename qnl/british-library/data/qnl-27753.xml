I.—Geographical Descriptior of Sur. 1. Sur is a town of about 12,000 inhabitants situated in the province of Jaalan in Oman, about 17 miles west of Has el 11 add and 94 miles south-east of Muscat. 2. The shore at Sur is low and sandy, destitute both of trees and other vegetation. The principal features of the place are a creek with the town standing on both sides,of the entrance and a stony ridge called Eed, which rises about 50 feet high from shingly flats and runs from north to south at a distance of 2 miles behind the town. The creek is half a mile long, 150 yards wide and only three-quarters of a fathom deep aft low water. 3. The town on the east of the creek is called Aiqa and is occupied by the Bani Bu Ali tribe ; that on the west is called Muqrimatain and is occupied by four sections of the Jenebeh tribe. The fighting strength of these sections is stated to be as follows r—Ararna, 2,000 ; Makhana, 800 ; Ghialin, 600 ; Fuwaris, 150. 4. Adjoining the north-west end of the ston}^ ridge are Sanaisalah, occupied, by the Bani Sinan, and Shariah, containing 100 houses of the Jenebeh (Arama). ' i c 5. On the plain at the back of the ridge, situated about 4 miles from the sea, is Balad As Sur, a stone-built village in which the Wall’s residence is situated, but in disrepair. There is also a fort named Jinah situated inside Balad As Sur and occupied b} 7 the Bani Amr, askaris of the Wall. Stated to be the key to the command of Sur. . ■ 6. There are extensive date groves and cultivation of lucerne and about 250 houses of various tribes who supply Sur with vegetables and fodder. 7. Balad As Sur contains about 95 wells and the water supply of Sur is obtained from there daily on donkeys. It was in order to keep the town in check by commanding the water supply that this site was chosen as the Wall’s residence. During hostilities water is also obtained at night with some difficulty from sweet wells to the south of the creek. 8. According to Lorimer’s Gazetteer (Yol. II, p. 1849), there were at one time over 100 Indian traders at Sur, but these numbers gradually dwindled down owing to the insecurity of the place. In 1923 there were 35, at present there are only 20 British subjects in Sur. These British merchants are living on sufferance, having to pay blackmail to the various Sheikhs of the Jenebeh in order to avoid being looted. I understand that since the kidnapping of a Bania in 1926, Mahomed Bin Naser, Amir of the Bani Bu Ali, has not himself levied anything from the Banias, but that he is suspected of instigating others to do so. 9. The climate of the place is stated to be very equable, and were it not for the insecurity trade there would be in a very flourishing condition.* 10. Unlike Muscat, there are roads suitable for wheeled traffic in. Muqrimatain.; The track between Muqrimatain and Balad As Sur would require some labour on it near Sanaisalah before it could be used fori wheeled traffic. 10 a. Sur is the port for the shipment of dates from Sharqiyah. Most of these dates are of the Mibsali variety, which is preferred by natives of the country to all other kinds and is much appreciated in India. The trade is a large one, the Badiyah division of Sharqiyah alone containing some 158,000 palms. 10b. The carrier trade from Sharqiyah to Sur is in the hands of the Hijriyin tribe, whilst the Jenebeh of Sur, who are a seafaring tribe and own some 130 dhows, convey them thence to Bombay and other ports. * The total number of Sur dhows is estimated at 150. Most of' these belong to the Jenebeh tribe. The Bani Bu Ali own 8 or 10. and a few are owned by the Bani Sinan.4 \ 10c. A small number of Jenebeh belonging to the Majaala section live at Izz near Nezwa, and in former days the Temeemah or Chief of the Jenebeh was chosen from this section. He was regarded with veneration, had despotic power, and took 25 per cent, on all bags or dates ■exported by the tribe. Presumably he acted as agent lor the Jenebeh in -Sharaiyah and helped to build up this trade. . , By 1900 his power had waned and a Sheikh of the Aiama section, who are the largest section in Sur, was recognised as lemeemah. Unfortunately a blood fend, which started in 1913, between the Aiama and Fuwans sections on the one hand and the IVlakhana and Chialin. on the other, undermined the influence of the Arama Sheikh and Mansur bin Nasei of the Majaala section of Masirah Island was elected lemeemah. The influence of this Sheikh over the Arama and Fuwaris sections waned, and he seems to have enlisted the sympathy of the Ainns of the Bani Bu Ah tribe for the purpose of regaining his authority. In 1927 he went to Mecca with the brothers of Amir Mahomed bin Naser to visit Ibn Saud, but died of smallpox on the return journey. The Jenebeh, though they bear an evil reputation in slave dealing and piracy, are not a warlike race, and under normal circumstances could have been kept in control easily enough ; but misrule, internal feuds and French influence have combined to let loose lawless elements amongst them. 10d. The Bani Bu Ali, as a tribe, live in the interior of Jaalan. Their principal port is Lashkharah, but they have a small settlement at Aic[a on the opposite side of Sur creek to the Jenebeh and own about eight or ten dhows. . According to Saiyid Mahomed bin Ahmed, Aiqa formerly belonged to the Hinawi. ° The Temeemah of the Bani Bu Ali, Mahomed bin Majid, occupied it under their patronage, but Abdullah bin Salim threw off the Hinawi connection and made the place purely a Bani Bu Ali settlement. The Bani Bu Ali are a wild and warlike tribe of ruffians. They put up a light against a Division of Indian troops, and their name is to be found on the colours of a number of Indian regiments. The Sultans of Muscat have never been able to control them, but have often enlisted their assistance .during former rebellions, when they have come chiefly for the sake of loot. II. —Historical Summary of the Bani Bu Ali. 11. The Bani Bu Ali tribe of Jaalan are a branch of the great Adnani tribe Bani Temeem. 12. The name Bani Bu Ali appears to be of recent origin, since in the '“History of the Imams and Seyyids of Oman,” by Said ibn Razik, translated by the Rev. G. P. Badger, they are constantly being referred to as the Beni Temeem, and not as the Bani Bu Ali. 13. The Bani Temeem, one of the most considerable tribes in Arabia, ascribe their origin to Temim—born about A.D. 120—the son of Murr, a descendant of Madhar through Tabikhah, and therefore of the race of Adnan and Maadd. They were dispersed over the north-east of Nejd from the Syrian desert to the borders of the el Yamamah. Their territory comprised the vast desert called Dahna, and extended on the south between the confines of A1 Yamamah and el Bahrain. 14. The Bani Bu Ali are accounted the most religious tribe in the Oman Sultanate. They belong to the Wahabi sect known as Azraqah and will not eat meat cooked by others. The founders of the Wahabi, Ibadhi, and lufuyyah sects all belonged to the Beni Temeem, whilst the Harth, the other branch of the Bani Temeem in Oman, have been the principal supporters of the Muttawa or extreme sect of the Ibadhis. 15. In 1807 the Wahabis sent a Joasmee fleet of 22 dhows to attack the fort at Sur, but met with such a spirited resistance on the part of the Jenebeh and Bani Bu Ali that they were driven off with heavy loss. Intrigue accomplished what force failed to do.(D 5 During the Wahabi invasion of 18J2-3, Salim bin Ali, Temeemah Sheikh of the Bani Bu Ali, became their supporter, h el pirn- them against the Bani Bu Hassan. In consequence of the part which Salim bin Ali had taken against the Bani Bu Hassan, there was a feud between the two tribes which resulted in a light wdierein Salim bin Ali and some of his people were killed ; some of the Bani Bu Hassan also fell, and as neither side would give in, the war between them continued, and has been carried on more or less constantly ever since. 16. Mahomed bin Ali, who succeeded Salim bin Ali as Temeemah, seceded from the tenets of the Ibadiyah and adopted those of the Wahabi, throwing oil the authority of the Imam. 17. In 1820 Saiyid Said, having heard that Mahomed bin Ali had induced many of the inhabitants of Jaalan to adopt his creed, and that his followers among the A1 Ashkarah had plundered many English ships wrecked there, applied to the English to aid him in an expedition against Mahomed bin Ali and his confederates. The Bani Bu Ali murdered the messenger carrying a letter to the chiefs from the British party investigating reports of piracy near Ras el Hadd. Captain Ihompson, in charge of operations, decided to avenge the act, and with a small force consisting of six companies, sailed to Muscat, where plans were made for the Sultan to reinforce him at Sur. The combined force marched on Balad Bani Bu Ali, the capital of the tribe, but proved entirely inadequate, and after attempting to take the town, were sharply repulsed. Six out of eight officers and 270 men were killed. In January 1821 Major-General Sir Lionel Smith sailed with two brigades to restore British influence in the gulf. From Sur, they also marched to Balad Bani Bu Ali, which surrendered after most -of the defending force had been killed or captured. The Sheikh, Mahomed bin Ali, was deported to Bombay. (Frontier and Overseas Expeditions from India, Vol. VI.)* 18. As late as 1815 the Bani Bu Ali were strict if not fanatical in the observance of the Wahabi principles. They have since relaxed something of their rigour and have resumed the smoking of tobacco, but they continue to be exact in their observance of the forms and times of prayer (Lorimer Vol. II., p. 66.) 19. In 1854 Sultan Saiyid Said stated that the Bani Bu Ali had lono- withdrawn from allegiance to him. 20. In the early part of the reign of Saiyid Thoweynee [1856-66] the Bani Bu Ali and the Bani Bu Hassan were almost constantly engaged in petty skirmishes against each other, in which Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim, the grandson of Mahomed bin Ali, at the head of the Bani Bu Ali, generally won the day. About the same time a series of raids was committed by the Wahibah against the Bani Bu Ali, these raids culminating in a serious engagement at Theeleyeh, in which Sheikh Abdulla greatly distinguished himself by totally defeating and routing the enemy.| 21. Towards Saiyid Thoweynee his attitude was that of neutrality, but .Saiyid Salim during his reign [1866-8], having had reason to suspect treachery on the part of the Hinawi garrison at Muscat, sent a large present to Sheikh Abdulla and requested his help to defend him in his position. Sheikh Abdulla gladly removed to Muscat with 300 men and garrisoned it but, owing to the vaeillatory policy of Saiyid Salim, was dismissed after a stay of four months and returned to Jaalan. Soon after this, Saiyid Azzan- ^ bin-Khais, on coming to power in 1868, summoned him and' the other 1 Sheikhs of the Bani Bu Ali to Muscat to render their submission, and on 1 their having refused to visit him, he marched against the Bani Bu Ali, seized e three of the Sheikhs of the tribe and threw them into prison at Muscat. * A good description of these operations and the subsequent proceedings is contained in ® the Annual Administration Reports. 1883-4, page 26. L6 t Abdulla bin Salim was not actually Temeemah of the Bani Bu Ali till 1867, in which g. year the Temeemah Mahomed bin Majid was murdered; but he certainly took a very prominent part in affairs before that date.6 22. Concerning this expedition Colonel Pelly, then Political Resident in the Gulf, wrote at the time (No. 202, dated 3rd November 18(&gt;0) ; “ If Saiyid Azan bin Khais should succeed in his present expedition in the south, be would he likely to strengthen his authority so considerably as to be able to keep a firmer grasp on Muscat territory than any other aspirant to power could.” 23. Sheikh Abdulla, however, managed to remain at liberty and thwart the Mutawwa power in every possible way. This led Saiyid Azzan to instigate the Bani Bu Hassan and the A1 Wahibah to wage war against the Bani Bu Ali. A serious engagement took place at Lazzeh, in which Abdulla defeated the two Hinawi tribes, and in revenge for this the Bani Bu Hassan rose again, only to be defeated a second time.at Seh A1 Masaddee. 24. In 1870, Saiyid Turki having requested the help of the Bani Bu Ali, they joined him at Sur, and 200 of their number marched under Sheikh Abdulla and Ausuf against Matrah, where they both took a leading part in scaling the wall and in the engagement which resulted in the death of Saiyid Azzan-bin-Khais, and subsequently restoring Order and holding the place till Saiyid Turki’s arrival from Sur. In recognition of their services Saiyid Turki granted the Amirs of the Bani Bu Ali exemption from the payment of customs on the goods imported by them into Sur. 25. In 1874 the Bani Bu Ali had at length amicably adjusted an internecine feud that had been going on amongst themselves for some time. The number of slain on each side being equal, each party forgave the other, and as regards wounded (about 70 in number), the blood money was determined by Mahomedan Law. 26. In 1874 Bani Bu Ali of the Ja’afarah section, belonging to Lashkharah, were responsible for the wrongful confinement and subsequent release on ransom of subjects of the Rao of Cufch at Hellanujah Island. Major Miles went to Lashkharah in H.M.S. Philomel, and as the surrender of the actual offenders could not be obtained, a fine of $600 was imposed and readily paid at Sur by Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim of the Bani Bu Ali, acting on behalf of the Ja’afarah.' 27. In 1881 the Bani Bu Ali attacked and defeated the Bani Bu Hassan in their own quarter of Jawabi al Khwarah. This engagement was described as the most sanguinary ever fought between Omani tribes, and is said to have cost 157 killed on both sides. . 28. In 1887 the Awlad Kassib kidnapped one Bania at Sur and had severely beaten another. Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim of his own accord restored the kidnapped Bania and imprisoned five of the Awlad Kassib.f 28a. In 1888-9 relations between the Bani Bu Ali and Jenebeh were strained. In May 1889 hostilities broke out, which resulted in a fight of some importance. Badr bin Saif, who went there to settle the dispute, reported on return that the Bani bu Ali had agreed to allow the passage of the creek at Sur to remain entirely in the hands of His Highness’s officials, and to abide by the decision of the Sultan in all local matters. 29. In 1895 the Bani Bu Ali sent a detachment in support of Saiyid Faisal when he was attacked at Muscat by Saleh bin Ali, but they made no determined effort to expel the rebels and recover the capital for their sovereign. In recognition of their services Saiyid Faisal granted the Amirs of the Bani Bu Ali an allowance of $100 per mensem. 30.. In the spring of 1903, the ordinary annual hostilities between the Ghafiris and Hinawis of Sharqiyah being then in progress, Abdulla bin Salim found reason to suspect that the people of Sur, though Ghafiris, were supplying his enemies with the sinews of war. He accordingly marched down the coast and declared the harbour blockaded until his demands for satisfaction were complied with. After Abdulla had returned to the interior, relations between his supporters in the Aiqa quarter and his opponents in Muqraimatain became so strained that when Major Cox (then * * For full details vide “ Narrative of Muscat Affairs,” 1874-5 (sic), para. 343. f The Awlad Kassib were originally a Fakhth of the Jenebeh, but’ came under the protection of the Bani Bu Ah.1 Political Agent, Muscat; arrived there in August he found the two factions •on the point of opening fire on each other across the intervening creek* The- Political Agent, having obtained a truce for 48 hours, returned at once to Muscat and informed the Sultan, who immediately proceeded to the spot.' The Jenebeh would not at once submit to his mediation, and before proceedings' had commenced in earnest the Sultan was called away by serious news from' Pustaq ; nevertheless, his visit actually averted fighting for the moment, and the dispute was adjusted, not long after, by neutral Sheikhs of the neighbour hood. (Lorimer, Vol. I, p. 580.) 3d. In 1913 Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim Ad Alawi died. He was considered a very daring man, well disposed towards the Sultans of Muscat, and always ready to help them. His eldest son Naser had predeceased him, and as the latter s son Mahomed was still a minor, Abdulla’s second son Ali was made Amir jointly with Mahomed bin Aaser. An arrangement which still continues. 32. During the 1913-9 rebellion the Paid P»u All took the part of the Sultan, but their behaviour was not altogether satisfactory. They sent the rice given them for their progress inland, to their homes at Sur and also left behind the ammunition, with which the Sultan had provided them, at Muscat for taking to their homes at the first convenient opportunity, and then on their arrival at Sib were demanding extra supplies of both food and ammunition. They retreated unexpectedly and unaccountably from Bidbid, where they were first established, to Watiyah. On being brought back to Muscat much alarm was fejt owing to their reputation for looting and general misbehaviour. Their counsels were divided, they quarrelled bitterly amongst themselves and paid little attention to the authority of their nominal leader, Mahomed bin Naser, and it was only with great difficulty that they could be induced to obey orders of any kind. In one quarrel amongst themselves, which arose over pilfering by some of them in the bazaar whom the Sheikh wished to punish, stones and sticks were freely used, with the result that there were several heads broken. Even the Sheikh himself was stoned. 33. Since the time Mahomed bin Naser started to assert his authority, relations between the Amirs and the Sultan have undergone a change. In 1920 the Wazir cut the allowances paid to the Bani Bu Ali through misdirected economy, but Mr. Wingate‘ :i&gt; restored them. 34. In 1923 the Amirs sent a petition to Government claiming that the port of Sur belonged to them and that the Sultan had nothing to do with the said port; that the Sultan did not supply them with arms and ammunition -according to agreement, and asking that they might enter into direct relations with the Government of India. Government replied that they were unable to intervene on their behalf. This claim to independence on the part of the Amirs of Jaalan appears to be based on the compact entered into by the Wahabi Sheikh on his invasion •of Oman, when certain Sheikhs were constituted Ameers or territorial lords in their own right without any dependence on Muscat (Bombay Government Records, XXIV, p. 43). 35. In 1924 Mahomed bin Naser informed Major Hinde* that he was authorised by the Muscat Government to settle ali disputes in Sur and had succeeded in doing so with the exception of Khamis bin Mubarak of the Arama section. From the records of the Council of Ministers it appears that Mahomed bin Naser wrote to the Sultan in March 1924 offering to effect, a settlement between the Jenebeh sections. The Sultan replied, permitting him to interfere during the Salifah period, but after this period he was not to interfere in anything. 36. Major Hinde then enquired how it was that the Sheikh did not permit the new customs house to be built at Sur. Mahomed bin Naser became •evasive and said nothing had ever been settled about it, finally denying that he had ever agreed to its being built and stating that he never would * Then Political Agent, Muscat.8 aoree He went on to sav that the right of His Highness to collect customs; at Snr and Aiqa had never been recognised by his forbears, himself or his tribe. 37 In 1925 Colonel Prideaux (then Political Resident in the Gulf) remarked that the Amirs were not very loyal to the Sultan and that if they had done their duty and given the Wali of Sur all the support he was entitled to there would have been no question of paying a ransom for PP0 release ot a Hindu who was kidnapped bj 7 a Pedouin. 38. In December 1925, in protesting against having to obtain a “No Obiection” certificate from the Political Agent before being allowed to import arms and ammunition from Bombay/Mahomed bin Naser wrote to the Government of India : “ I submit that this request of the Political Department of Bombay is not fair to me as a ruler of an independent State, and it would be highly detrimental to my dignity to ask for consent or certificate from the Political Agent, Muscat. I hold the Political Agent m high regard, but I think you will appreciate that I prefer to preserve the dignity of my State not to do an act detrimental to its independent possession.” 39. Mahomed bin Naser has as his lieutenants (1) Abdulla bin Saleh, a Habshi, who was his agent in Bombay, speaks English and is reputed to have drafted Mahomed bin Naser’s letter to the Government of India. He is stated to be very unreliable ; (2) Mahomed bin Said, a Syrian whom he engaged about December 1927 1o teach his children. Reputed to know a little English and to be much travelled. III.—Historical Summary of the Jenebeh. 40. Little is traceable concerning the early history of this tribe. According to Colonel Miles, they are a branch of the Bani .Jabir and, therefore, Wilad Dhubyan of Kahtanate origin, but now classed as Ghafiri. They are considered the least religious tribe in Oman, and in this connection it would be interesting to trace whether there is any connection between them and Abu Said al Hassan, el Janaby, the Karmaty, who abolished prayer and fasting and the pilgrimage and attacked the Hajj and invaded Oman about the year A.D. 900.'• :7 41. A violent grudge of old standing between the Jenebeh and the Harth* (the tribe of Sheikh Isa bin Saleh—the strong man of the Imam’s Government), culminating in an affray near Khaburah in which the Jenebeh were the victors, is mentioned as taking place in the early part of the reign of Saiyid Said (1807-56), whilst they were assisting the latter in his opera tions against the Wahabis. Later they appear to have assisted the Wahabis in conjunction with Mahomed bin Nasir al Jabir against Saiyid Said.^ Later still they appear once more to have assisted Saiyid Said against the \\ ahabis. 42. In 1865 the Jenebeh of Sur, discontented with the Sultan’s rule, sought Wahabi assistance from Baraimi ; and the Wahabi agent, nothing loth, sent a contingent, who plundered Suq Sur, assisted by the Jenebeh and Bani Bu Ali. Nearly all the damage inflicted fell on Hindu traders and shopkeepers ; the extent of their losses was estimated at $27,700 and one of their number was killed and another wounded. Before being allowed to leave for Muscat, they were stripped of almost all their clothing.| 43. Colonel Pelly considered that a prompt and severe example should be made of the Jenebeh, who were implicated with the Wahabis in the plunder and murder of our subjects at Sur. There were other reasons too which called for the punishment of this tribe. They had long been notorious among our naval officers as the most cruel and unscrupulous slavers and pirates. They were among the Arab slave dealers who had conspired in 1861 to assassinate the British x\gent at Zanzibar for his anti-slavery proceedings. It was also believed that they were concerned in the murder of three seamen of H.M.S. Wasp, who had disappeared from * They were in league with the Bani Jabir for many years, following their fortunes vis-a-vis the Wahabis. t For fuller details vide “Muscat and its Relations with the Wahabi Power.”9 their craft a few months before. The Sultan of Muscat was assured of their criminality and had himself proceeded to Sur five or six months previously with the intention of punishing them, but was obliged to return to Muscat owing to a conspiracy to dethrone him. Colonel Felly had also in the preceding month sent the Berenice to Sur with a letter addressed to the heads of the Jenebeh demanding payment of $27,000 as compensation for the property plundered by them from British subjects and warning them that measures would be taken to enforce the demand. Their reply was that on a former occasion when Lieut. Pengelly threatened a tribe on the coast nothing was done, and they were quite sure the Resident would not come now. 44. On the 11th February 18Gb H.M.S. Highflyer appeared off Sur to- insist on atonement by the Jenebeh for their part in the affairs of August, by payment of $27,700 compensation within 24 hours. On the tribe attempting to procrastinate, a tire was opened which demolished their fort, the whole of their boats were either confiscated or burnt, and a large quantity of their ship timber was burnt. No personal injury was suffered by non-combatants, who had ample opportunity to move, but' a small part of the town was burnt accidentally in consequence of a change in the direction of the wind. 45. In the month of June 1875 a godown belonging to the principal Indian trader of Sur, a Bania named Jethnand Motamull, was broken into during his absence on business at Muscat by a party of Jenebeh, who offered violence to the watchman in charge and carried off plunder to the value of about $1,600. The spoil was openly sold in the town and the robbers made no attempt at concealment of themselves, but no steps were- taken by the Sheikhs of the tribe to cause restitution, and it does not even appear that they offered to remonstrate with or suppress their tribesmen. There was no Wali or other authority on behalf of the Sultan at Sur at the time who could have taken action in the matter. The Bania therefore- reported the matter to Colonel Miles and the case was referred to His Highness, who promised redress. 46. Soon after this, H.M.S. Rifleman happened to arrive at Sur, and the Sheikhs of the Jenebeh, apprehensive that her arrival was connected with the outrage committed by their tribesmen, and fearing the results, seized the offender, and would have doubtless caused restitution, but H.M.S. Rifle man, which only dropped anchor for a few hours incidentally in passing, having in the meantime weighed anchor, the Sheikhs perceived how matters stood and released their tribesmen without further question. 47. During His Highness Saiyid Turki’s absence in Gwadur, the case was presented to Saiyid Abdul Aziz, but without beneficial result. About this time the Sheikhs of the tribe went to the Bauia and offered an arrangement promising to make good the loss in eight months. This arrangement they afterwards repudiated. Saiyid Turki was reminded of the matter after his return, but he was not able to put sufficient pressure^ on the tribe to cause them to make good the loss or to bring them to account for their misconduct, and they succeeded in procrastinating and delaying to reply until the season opened and they could get away in their bughlahs. 48. His Highness finally informed Colonel Miles that he left the matter in the hands of Government, and as the latter considered the continued failure of the Jenebeh tribe to cause restitution to a British subject plundered by them injurious to British interests, he supported His Highness’s request that the enforcement of reparations might be undertaken by Government. To have held His Highness personally responsible for the loss sustained at the Jenebeh’s hands would have tended still further to weaken His Highness’s authority, and would have encouraged the predatory Arabs to continue their depredations on British subjects at His Highness’s expense whilst the exaction of reparation from this tribe would, on the other hand, be a cautionary warning to all. Colonel W. F. Prideaux, the Political Resident, also suggested that in addition to the original amount a fine of $2,000 should be levied on the Jenebeh, partly as compensation for the delay and partly as a penalty for the offence committed against a British subject. 3393 B40. At first, however, the Government of India would not comply with the Sultan’s request, claiming that the repression of crime and the punishment of criminals was the duty of the Sultan, and that in return fox the responsibility which it has incurred in guaranteeing to Saiyid Turk! the payment of the Zanzibar subsidy and for other material aid which had been afforded to Saiyid Turk! from time to time, the Government of India might fairly expect that the punishment of offenders in Oman would be effectually carried out, in so far at least as offences against British subjects were concerned, without requisitions being made on the British Government for armed intervention. 50. The Sultan’s efforts to comply with this attitude of Government were so feeble and ineffective that finally in July 1877 the Political Agent was authorised by Government to proceed to Sur in ILM.S. Teazer and convey the Sultan’s demands. 51. When the Political Agent arrived at Sur on the 24th July he wrote to the Jenebeh enclosing His Highness’s order and warned them that if they failed to comply within 24 hours, measures of a coercive nature would follow. The Jenebeh had no recognised head at the time, the nominal Sheikh being a boy as yet without authority, but several of the leading men came on board in reply to the letter. They expressed their readiness to comply with His Highness’s order, but explained that the absence of a recognised authority amongst them rendered it necessary for each member of the tribe to pay his share at once, as, were some to pay on behalf of the rest, their chance of reimbursement would be small. On this ground, and on the ground that several of their principal men were inland fighting against the Bani Bu Hassan, they asked for an extension of time and were allowed until sunset on the 25th. 52. By noon of the 25th, Jethanand’s claim amounting to $1,600 had been satisfied, partly by a money payment and partly by a buggalow (or native dhow), of which he had recei ved possession. At sunset the Governor of Sur and Jethanand came on board. The former delivered to the Political Agent $2,000 and the latter stated that his claim against the Jenebeh had been fully satisfied. Government expressed satisfaction with the results obtained and directed that the fine of $2,000 should be paid to Saiyid Turki, after deducting the expenses incurred in the measures which had been taken. 53. In 1885 Saiyids Faisal and Fahd went to Sur to endeavour to obtain payment of certain customs duty from the Jenebeh, but were unsuccessful. 54. In 1898 Suleiman bin Suweylim .who was the Sultan’s Wall of Dhofar, Sur, and Sohar, went to Sur, where the inhabitants were being encouraged by French agency to make light of the Sultan’s authority. He summoned the Sheikhs of the Jenebeh and informed them that in future he would not respect Khafir and would seize the persons and property of those who belonged to tribes whom he considered unfriendly, even if in the house of the “ Khafir ” himself. (When a party or caravan wish to pass through the country of another tribe, they take with them as escort a man belonging to the tribe through 1 whose country they wish to pass. The party or •caravan is then safe from attack, and this is known as the “ Khafir” system. It is respected to such an extent that members of a tribe travelling under this protection through the country of a tribe with which they even have a blood feud, are safe.) * 55. This aroused the greatest indignation amongst the Jenebeh. Suleiman then proceeded to Muscat, leaving his son, a lad of 12 or 13 years, in charge of the place. Later he wrote to his son at Sur, ordering him to build a fort at a spot which would at once command both the water supply of the town and the caravan route to the interior. Such a fort would have enabled the Sultan to overcome the Jenebeh and ensure a large increase in the revenue derived from the customs at Sur. About this time Suleiman’s son threatened to shoot a gardener, and actually did shoot a bullock and cut,11 down a date tree belonging to the gardener, because the latter refused to supply him with some green grass, which he was keeping for his own camels. 56. The four sections of the Jenebeh then combined and wrote letters to the Sultan asking him to stop the building of the fort and remove Suleiman’s son from Sur. The Sultan did not reply to these letters. Five of the Sheikhs then came to Muscat and placed their complaints before the Sultan, but His Highness turned a deaf ear and they went away disappointed. 57. At length, after representations from several quarters, His Highness sent his writer Hamad to Sur to listen to the complaints of the Jenebeh and stop the building of the fort. No attention was paid by Suleiman’s son to. this order, and on Hamad’s return His Highness did not even take the trouble: to hear his report. 58. Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim of the Bani Bu All now intervened and induced the Sultan to stop the building of the fort, but the Jenebeh insisted on the recall of Suleiman’s son and said they were quite prepared to fight rather than submit to Suleiman’s rule. 59. The Jenebeh then cut off the supplies of the garrison. The Sultan at once wrote to the Jenebeh warning them that their attitude, if persisted in, would only result in speedy and condign punishment. The Sultan’s messenger was informed by the Sheikhs that unless he left Sur before nightfall, his blood would be on his own head, 60. It was difficult to understand why the Sultan persisted in trying to force Suleiman bin Suweylim’s unpopular and high handed rule on the Jenebeh against their will. He had neither money nor troops with which to- coerce the tribe. Any man he could raise would come out, not for the purpose of fighting, but merely to live at His Highness’s expense ; whilst the Jenebeh., though not a martial tribe, were well armed and had sufficient money to induce other tribes to join them. 61. At length, towards the end of September, a force consisting of 600 Jenebeh, 200 Bani Bu Ali and 150 Bani Rasib beleaguered the fort occupied by the Sultan’s representative. The rebels opened fire at long range and the garrison replied. This lasted for three hours without resulting in any loss for either side, when it suddenly seemed to strike one of the Sheikhs that some members of his tribe were in the fort. The Sheikh thereupon advanced up to the walls under a flag of truce and called upon the garrison to surrender. A parley then ensued and an agreement was arrived at, the rebels guaranteeing that the Walks son and the beleaguered garrison would be escorted in safety to the coast and placed on board a vessel bound for Muscat. The fort was accordingly evacuated and the party despatched to Muscat. 62. Before returning to their homes the rebels destroyed the new and half built fort referred to above. The Sheikhs wrote to the Sultan offering to hand over the fort to anyone deputed by him except Suleiman bin Suweylim or his son, and the Sultan despatched a fresh garrison under Hamad bin Saif. The Sultan wrote a conciliatory letter to the Sheikhs, informing them that he pardoned them for their late act of rebellion, but the Sheikhs, not convinced of his bond fides, refused to allow Hamad to take over the fort and he returned to Muscat. 63. At the end of the year the Jenebeh were persuaded to accept a new Wali, and Sheikh Muhammad bin Hamad (the present Wali of Matrah and President of the Council; and a fresh garrison of 60 men took possession of the fort. The fort was found to have been entirely dismantled ; all the woodwork had been removed and nothing left but the bare walls. 64:. During this period the authority of the Sultan was being further undermined as a result of French intrigue. A plan of the harbour at Sur, published by the French Government in 1901, showed that their attention had been directed to that place at some earlier date, and in 1893 M. Chapui, a somewhat disreputable French subject, arrived at Sur in a steamer flying the French flag and tried to obtain a site for a coal shed there.12 The scheme for advancing hrench interests by a wide distribution of the Trench flng was boldly pursued. In November lb&gt;91 it was stated that as many as 50 Sur boats flying the French flag were bound for Bushire and 18 had put in to Lingah. (This question is further dealt with in the review of the slave trade.) Ity 1900 the people of Sur, especially those of the Jenebeh tribe, had almost ceased, under French encouragement, to regard the Sultan as their master. 65. In 1900 Hilal bin Amr arrived at Sur from East Africa, joined hands with M. Ottavi, and began to inveigh against the Sultan and the British; and the spirit of the Jenebeh was such that, when summoned by the Sultan to meet him at Muscat, they refused to go and insolently suggested that he should deal with them instead through the^ French Vice-Consul. It was this state of affairs which obliged Saiyid Faisal in June 1900 to make a visit to Sur, the first since his! accession in 1888. His reception was more favourable than he had expected, for all the elders of the town immediately paid their respects to him, the Cheif Sheikh of the Bani Bu Ali came down from the interior with a thousand men to do him honour, and the Sultan was successful, before he left, in obtaining from the French flag holders of the port, including the Jenebeh, a formal profession of allegiance to himself and a renunciation of French protection. 66. In 1901 the Sultan sent 80 Askaris to garrison his post at Sur, and the French flag holders, few of whom had observed their promise given in the previous year, understanding the act as a threat to themselves, asked M. Ottavi whether he would protect them in case of an attack by the Sultan’s troops; his reply was unfavourable, and the incident marked another stage in the decline of French influence at Sur. 67. About 191.3 a blood feud started between the Arama and Makhana sections of the Jenebeh, which has continued ever since. In 1918 His Highness the Sultan visited Sur and fined the Jenebeh Rs. 14,000 and imprisoned 26 Sheikhs. This action kept the peace for about two years. 68. In 1919 the Muscat customs were reorganised and the people of Sur, seeing that in future the dues would be more strictly enforced, refused to allow a customs house to be built. In 1920 Captain MacOollum, the then Wazir, went to Sur in H.M.S. Britomarf, and the Jenebeh agreed to accept the new arrangements. Things went smoothly for a short while and then smuggling began again and has continued ever since. The customs house was not built, difficulties being invariably placed in the way, and the Wali became as powerless and inept as ever. 69. Spasmodic murdering went on, and in 1923 the Council of Ministers sent Sheikh Rashid, Minister for Religious Affairs, to attempt to put an end to the feuds. He returned, having been openly flouted and having accomplished nothing. In July Zubair, Minister of Justice, accompanied by Captain Alban, I.A. (in command of the Muscat Levies) and 150 levies and three machine guns, proceeded to Sur and occupied the fort. Zubair reported that he had settled all feuds and caused blood money to be paid over immediately in his presence and recovered $6,400 customs dues from the merchants and fined the tribe $4,000. A site was selected for a custom house and the party returned to Muscat in triumph. Unfortunately there was one case in which blood money was not accepted. The Makhana agreed to pardon the murderer, an Arama. He was imprisoned in Muscat and was released in 1924. Meeting an armed slave of the murdered Sheikh on the outskirts of Sur, he decided the man had been detailed to kill him and fired and killed the slave. This started indiscriminate firing between the sections, in which one Arama boy was killed. The Fuwaris took a hand and seized a water donkey belonging to the Arama, and a struggle ensued, in which an Arama girl was killed. The Wali was able to use the Ramzan feast for arranging a 45 days’ armistice. 70. About this time (1924) Mahomed bin Naser, Amir of the Bani Bu Ali, ■started to take an interest in the affairs of the Jenebeh, having formed an alliance with Mansur bin Naser, Jenebeh Sheikh of Masirah, and won over the Makhana and A1 Ghialin sections in Sur—the weaker party in the feud among the Jenebeh—to acknowledge his authority.0 13 71. In 1925 Sheikh Mansur bin Naser, of Masirah Island, proceeded to Snr and informed the Hindu community that there was no Sultan’s Government in Sur, and that they were to look to him for justice. He tried to form a committee of leading men for the administration' of justice -as the local Wali had been found incapable. The Wall told the Hindus that he was powerless and that they should inform the British Government. 72. In 1927 Sheikh Mansur bin Naser of Masirah, accompanied by Hamdan bin Naser and Salim bin Naser, brothers of Mahomed bin Naser of the. Bani Bu Ali, stayed at Mecca for three months as the guests of His Majesty Ibn Sand. Mansur bin Naser died of smallpox on the return journey. IY.—The Slave Trade at Sur. 73. British efforts for the suppression of the slave trade first took shape in 1822 by a treaty concluded with Saiyid Said of Muscat, the object being the extinction of the slave trade between Africa and India. This treaty was amplified in 1838-9. Another agreement was made in 1845. Again in 1873 a new treaty was made. 74. The Resident in the Gulf, writing in 1844, says, “ Muscat and Sur are the principal primary ports to which slaves from whencesoever shipped, whether from Zanzibar or the Red Sea, are brought.” In the’sixties the Political Agent in Muscat estimated that about 4,000 out of 15,000 slaves passing up the Gulf were landed either at Ras el Hadd or the adjacent port of Sur. 75. In 1852 the steam vessel Tigris was placed on special duty at the entrance to the Gulf, but it soon became evident that surveillance would be more effective if instituted on the African coast. 76. In the ’seventies somewhat greater success attended the efforts of H.M.S. Magpie and Vulture, sent to cruise off Ras el Hadd. The latter •captured a large^ dhow, in which were 169 slaves, mostly women and children. The Nakhoda of the vessel was imprisoned by the Sultan of Muscat, and the vessel destroyed. From a description in the Times of India (October 1872) of a slave vessel captured by the Vulture, the methods of the exporters appear to have been characterised by great barbarity. “ The number of slaves it was impossible at the time to estimate ; so crowded on deck and in the hold below was the dhow, that it seemed, but for the aspect of misery, a very nest of ants. The hold, from which an intolerable stench proceeded, was several inches deep in the most foul bilge water and refuse. Down below, there were numbers of children in the most loathsome stages of smallpox and scrofula of every description. A more disgusting* and degrading spectacle of humanity could not be seen, while the foulness of the dhow was such that the sailors could hardly endure it. When the slaves were transferred to the Vulture the poor wretched creatures were so dreadfully emaciated and weak that many had to be carried on board and lifted for every movement. How it was that so many survived such hardships was a wonder to all. . . . But perhaps the most atrocious piece of cruelty of the Arabs was heard afterwards from the slaves themselves, viz., that at the first discovery of smallpox among them by the Arabs, all the affected slaves were at once thrown overboard, and this was continued day by day until, they said, 40 had perished in this manner.” 77. In 1873 H.M.S. London was stationed at Zanzibar for 10 years, and during that period the wholesale traffic was for the time being suppressed. But slaves still arrived in the Persian Gulf in small lots and dealers had begun to conceal their operations by use of the French flag, which secured them against search by British vessels. In the ’eighties there was a recrudescence of the trade owing to the withdrawal of H.M.S. London from Zanzibar. 78. Inquiry showed that slaves were brought to Sur in vessels belonging to that port, most of which flew French colours. The slaves were ordinarily landed at Sur itself, but the owners of the vessels had accomplices at Ras el Hadd and other places, and when British cruisers appeared they14 received warning and landed them at small places near by, whence the slaves were marched in gangs to Sur. The demand in the interior behind Sur is not great, for the system of irrigation in Jaalan and Sharkiyah does not demand slave labour. The majority of the slaves are re-exported in small vessels to the Batineh, where irrigation is mostly from wells, and where some of them are retained. The balance is distributed from the Batineh to the Trucial coast by land. At this time the number imported here annually was estimated at 300. The Jenebeh tribe proclaimed openly that their only object in taking the French flag was to protect their slaving operations. 79. Sur quickly attained a disreputable prominence in the traffic, and , it became increasingly clear that the only way to put an end to it was to break up the Sur depot; but the chief obstacle to such a step was the attitude of France in regard to her flag. Political difficulties arose owing to the extent to which the protection of the French flag' was being abused. 80. From 1892 onwards abundant evidence was forthcoming of the abuse of the French flag by importers. In 1896 several vessels carrying slaves were captured. In May the Political Agent cajjtured a vessel carrying 28 slaves. A few days later H.M.S. Lapwing captured a vessel carrying 14 slaves, whilst the Sultan’s officials rescued two recently imported slaves at Bunder Gisseh. H.M.S. Sphinx captured two vessels flying the French flag. The one had 30 slaves on board ; the other 140. A third vessel,, whose French papers appeared to be in order, was allowed to proceed. The vessels, though stated in the papers to belong to Madagascar and Comoro, were in reality from Sur. 81. Owing to political difficulties created by these seizures, slave cruising was virtually discontinued and from this time onwards the traffic appears to have been on the increase. The Sultan was assured by the Government of India that his subjects could not be removed from his jurisdiction, but the precariousness of his position at Sur and his fear of the French Government deterred him from taking any action. 82. In 1900 Captain P. Z. Cox, then Political Agent, Muscat, re-examined the question of the importation of slaves. He found that about 1,000 slaves had been imported that year into Sur, of which about half had been carried in vessels under the French flag. In 1901 about 1,000 slaves were again imported, whilst in 1902 the supply was stated to be abundant. In 1902, 114 Arabs were captured b}^ the Portuguese in Mozambique whilst actually engaged in slave trading. About a third of them died in confinement, while of the remainder 54 were sentenced to transportation for 25 years. With a few excey&gt;tions these men belonged to the Jenebeh and Bani bu Ali tribes of Sur. The number of the captives who might have claimed French protection was never ascertained, but it was admitted by one of them before the Portuguese authorities that two of the vessels captured flew the French flag. 83. In 1905 the award of the Hague tribunal in regard to the French flag question compelled the French authorities to exercise a closer supervision over native masters entitled to use the French colours. 84. Since the settlement of the French flag question and the stoppage of the principal sources of supply at Zanzibar and on the African coast very little attention appears to have been paid to the traffic of slaves at Sur, but I am assured from several sources that the trade, both in slaves and in arms, is very profitable and nearly every Arab dhow arriving at Sur has a small quantity of these commodities. The slaves are being imported from Socotra, Mokalla and Dhofar, whilst the arms come from Jeddah and the Italian ports in the Pied Sea. Y.—Summary of recent Events in Sur. 85. In 1927 the Arama and Makhaua sections of the Jenebeh each built three new forts in their quarters against the orders of the Wali. 86. In August 1927 Mr. Thomas, Minister of Finance, went to Sur. He attempted to induce the Jenebeh to pay 2|- lakhs of rupees which they owe15 Khan Bahadur Nasib and Ali Musa Khan, merchants of Muscat, and to pull down the forts which they had built. It appeared to Mr. Thomas that the opposition to this came mainly from the Arama section, and on leaving iSur, in the Al Saeed, he took in tow an Arama sambuk, which was in the harbour, whereupon the Arama fired on the Al Saeed. Beyond hitting the funnel -and one of the ship’s boats, no damage was done. The fire was not returned. The Council fined the Arama section Its. 10,000, but have been unable to enforce this. cS7. In April 1928 the Amirs of the Bani Bu Ali established a new customs post at Aiqa. Their customs officer wrote to the State Customs Official at Sur, demanding refund, of customs which the State had levied on the grounds that the boat belonged to the Bani Bu Ali. The Amirs refused to furnish the Councirs representatives with any explanation regarding this customs post. 88. About the same time the Bani Bu Ali stopped a boat belonging to the Arama section from entering the creek, whereupon the Arama prevented a Bani Bn Ali boat from entering the creek. The Bani Bu Ali then occupied Balad As Sur with a view to commanding the water supply of Sur and obtaining mastery over the town. On the I5th April they were attacked in Balad As Sur by about 70 men of the Arama and FuWaris under the leadership of Sheikh Yaser al Majaala. The Arama lost six killed, whilst the Bani Bu Ali lost 10 killed and three wounded. Sheikh Rashid, Minister for Religious Affairs, accompanied by Saiykl Shahab, brother of His Highness, went to Sur on the 17th April to try and settle the dispute. Their reception by the Amirs was not cordial, and they returned to Muscat on the 2ord April, having failed to accomplish anything. However, through the intervention of other Sheikhs, the parties came to terms. The Arama and Makhana sections each destroyed one of their forts. All sections of the Jenebeh were to pay $20 on each of their boats to the Amirs for this year only, and Sheikhs Yaser and Naser bin Mubarak were to call on the Amirs at Aiqa. 89. On the 25th May the Amirs wrote to the Council of Ministers, stating that their action had been taken on behalf of the Muscat State and demanding payment of $10,000 expenses. They attempted to send this letter to the Council through the Political Agent, but it was returned to them and they were informed that if they wished to communicate with the Council they should do so direct. 90. In May Abdulla bin Saleh, Secretary to Mahomed bin Naser, proceeded to Bushire to interview the Political Resident. He asserted the Bani Bu Ali did not recognise the Sultan’s authority and attempted to get a certificate of identity at the Agency. He was directed to obtain a passport from the Sultan’s Government. 91. In July 1928 His Highness the Sultan and the Council of Ministers furnished their views on the situation at Sur. They resented the letters and actions of the Amirs of Jaalan, realised they were not strong enough to deal with the situation and asked for the assistance of the British Government. 92. In August 1928 the Amirs wrote to the Political Resident claiming that Sur was a part of their territory, that the Sultan’s W ali was there and customs collected with their permission, that the town and customs were under their protection and everything would be accomplished in its proper time. 93. On the 21st August a party of about 15 Arabs, chiefly of the Fuwaris section of the Jenebeh, boarded a Cutch Mandvi buggalow belonging to a British subject, Khimji Ramdas, which had arrived from Karachi, overawed the crew with rifles and daggers, and made off with 22 bags of rice and Rs. 200 worth of personal property belonging to the Nakhoda. Most of the culprits are known. The Council of Ministers arrested one of them in Muscat and are attempting to obtain the surrender of the others from the Fuwaris Sheikhs. 94. On the night of the 27th August some Arabs climbed over a broken Wall and got into the fort where the Wali lives. They stabbed his two bestn 16 horses. The Wall’s Askaris are believed to have had a hand in it m conjunction with the Baui Bu Ali. bliey have been replaced by others from Muscat. The Wall’s telephone line from his residence to the customs is also being cut constantl} r . 94a. About this time a party of the Meshaikh tribe (a small tribe of Bedouins and robbers, originally allied to the Beni Bu Hassan, but now stated to be under the protection cf the Bani Bu Ali) stationed themselves on the road outside Muqrimatain and looted all people coming into Sur for some days. They killed a number of donkeys. 95. On the 18th September a shop belonging to a British subject— Motimul Sukkumul—was broken into at noon by two men, an Arab and a slave, whilst the owner was upstairs. The robbers ran away on seeing the owner coming down, taking with them $188 in cash and ornaments worth $95 ; whilst running away they dropped $45 worth of ornaments, which were recovered. 96. Mahomed bin Naser of the Bani Bu Ali removed the flagstaff from his house at Aiqa and erected a new flagstaff on ground level. On the 21st September Abdulla bin Saleh, mentioned above, hoisted Ibn Sand s flag on the newly erected flagstaff. A salute of three guns was fired when the flag was hoisted and one gun when it was lowered in the evening. This appears to be a parallel to the action of Saiyid Fadhl bin Alawi Moplah at Dhofar in 1875, when the latter styled himself as Governor of Dhofar under the Ottoman Porte (see Lorimer, Vol. I, p. 591). 97. On the 21st September a caravan from Budiyah (Imam’s territory), which had brought dry dates for Khimji Ramdas and obtained advances for a further supply, was returning to Budiyah laden with rice. It was seized by a party of Fuwaris under one Said bin Abdulla, who was the leader of the party who looted Khimji Ramdas’s boat on the 21st August. Naser bin Ali, Khimji Ramdas’s landlord, succeeded in intercepting them before they had reached Jebel El Fed and recovered the caravan without loss. Said went to the Wali and threatened him that if the Council did not release the man whom they had arrested at Muscat in connection with the looting of the buggalow, he would commit further mischief. 98. On the 26th September Mahomed bin Naser wrote to the Wali of Sur not to allow caravans to come to Sur from Budiyah with dates. The Wali refused to comply. He also wrote to the Political Agent stating that his truce with the Hijriyin had been broken and asking him to warn British subjects not to deal with the Hijriyin of Budiyah. He was asked not to interfere with the legitimate trade of British subjects. It would seem from the above that the gang of Fuwaris Avere acting in conjunction Avith Mahomed bin Naser in stopping the Budiyah caravan. 99. It is believed that this action of the Amir is in order to induce caravans to proceed to his new customs at Aiqa instead of Muqrimatain. He has also attempted to induce British merchants to transfer themselves to Aiqa, offering to charge 2|- per cent, instead of 5 per cent, as charged by the Muscat authorities. 100. There has been trouble also with regard to a Chinaman who went to Sur via Aden and Muscat. He bought a large quantity of fish and fins and refused to pay the export duty on the grounds that he had already paid it to the Amirs. On the 16th September Abdulla bin Saleh wrote to the customs Mudir, stating that the Chinaman was under the protection of the Amirs, that his goods should be shipped to any place he desires, and that the Government had no right to recover any duty in any places under the rule of the Amirs. 101. On the 30th September the Director of Customs at Muscat received information from Sur that the Amirs had ordered their man in charge of customs at Aiqa to count the sailing vessels entering Jerama and Sur creeks as they intended to charge anchorage fee. They intended also to register boats at Aiqa in the name of the Amirs. The levy of such dues at Khor Jerama would appear to be a revival of the dispute in 1877-80, Avhen the people of Ras el Hadd attempted to levy17 Ml such, dues and the British authorities were obliged to take cognisance of the matter. British war vessels visited the spot in 1877, 1879 and 1880. All tolls on trading vessels entering the Khor were then finally abolished. (Lorimer, Yol. 1, p. 515; also Narrative of Muscat Affairs.) 102. The latest news from Sur is that the caravan mentioned above left Sur for Budiyah on the 29th September accompanied as far as Qalab Kayeh by an escort of Fuwaris and Wall’s askaris. Beyond Qalab Ray eh it was ‘ seized by a party of Bani Bu Ali, assisted by Ghialin and Makhana, and taken to Aiqa. The Wali sent a letter to the Amirs protesting against this, but they have refused to restore the caravan. YI.—Review of the Situation at Sur. 103. Hitherto the policy pursued with regard to the slave trade, arms, traffic and ill-treatment of British subjects at Sur may Ire summarised in the words of Major (now Sir) P. Z. Cox in his Report No. 373, dated 29th August 1902 : — “ It must be conceded that the present Sultan has been in a great measure powerless to do much to stop the ingress of newly captured negroes, and at any rate during the time that the question of the French flag has been in process of negotiation between His Highness and the French Government it would have been ill-advised on our part to put upon him any special pressure in this connection; but I venture to submit that the recent purchase of a steamer for him and the fact that the question of the French flag seems to be shaping to a settlement, affords a convenient and fitting opportunity for the address to His Highness of a strong exhortation on the subject of Sur and its connection with the trade in arms and slaves- and as to his own position in regard thereto.” 104. The purchase of a small patrol steamer in 1926 has proved no more effective as regards Sur than it did in 1902, whilst the total armed force of the Muscat Infantry which could be made available for despatch to Sur is about 70 men. Such a force would be inadequate to meet a determined attack on the part of the tribesmen and could not look for reinforcement from Muscat. 105. Both the Sultan and the Council of Ministers realise that they are not strong enough to deal with the situation without the support and assistance of the British Government, and that unless they obtain such assistance the little control which the Muscat authorities exercise over Sur will cease. They have definitely asked for such assistance. The prestige of the Muscat Government rests at present on the support which they are able to obtain from the British Government. Without such support the State is impotent. If assistance were withheld the result would be far- reaching, as every part of the country would be affected. 106. A number of Arabs in Oman are of opinion that the British Government are not anxious to see a strong rule established at Muscat and that they would countenance the formation of another independent authority in Jaalan. This, 1 have heard, is the opinion of the Amirs of Jaalao. Considered politically and in its bearing's on the welfare of the Muscat State and the general peace of Oman, it seems most undesirable that any such claim should be countenanced. The Amirs could not maintain their independence, and the almost inevitable result of such a claim being allowed would tend to foster the intrigues for extraneous support which the Amirs are now active in fomenting. 107. Whether Mahomed bin Naser has the approval of Ibn Sand for hoisting his flag at Aiqa seems doubtful, but the extension of Ibn Sand’s influence to this part of the coast would seem to be undesirable.* * In 1865 His Excellency the Governor of Bombay pointed out the evil effect of the revival of Wahabi power on the Indian Ocean with regard to piracy and slave trading, and that these aggressions threatened seriously to injure Muscat, a power which for sevei'al generations past has been the only representative of civilisation and order in Eastern Arabia. He proposed that aid be afforded to the Sultan to re-establish his authority in Sur or any other place on the seaboard of which his rebellion^ subjects or the Wahabis may have deprived him. (Minute dated 9th October 1865.) 3393 CIS 108. The value of Sur from the point of view of prestige appears to have been realised by Colonel Felly, who wrote in 1869 that if Saiyid Azzan bin Khais were successful in his expedition in Jaalan, he would be likely to strengthen his authority so considerably as to be able to keep a firmer grasp on Muscat territory than any other aspirant to power could. 109. It was also realised by the French, who confined all their efforts to undermine the Sultan’s authority to that place. 110. The extension of the influence of the Amirs of Jaalan has also -caused some uneasiness to Sheikh Isa bin Saleh and the Imam s Government. The Council fear that the Imam’s Government may interfere and obtain mastery over Sur, in which case most of the trade from the interior would be deviated to Sur, and the revenues and trade of Muscat would become negligible. 0 111. In 1895 the British Government extended to Saiyid Faisal the guarantee given to his father that they would not allow attacks to be made upon Muscat and Matrah, whatever differences the Sultan might have with his tribes. In actual practice this guarantee was extended to ail the ports of the Batineh coast, and to Kuryat, at which British subjects were residing, and in 1896 an offer was made by the British Government and finally accepted by the Sultan, of naval assistance for the recovery of Dhofar. 112. If assistance is now to be afforded, the question arises as to what form such assistance shall take, and I venture to put forward the following remarks on the question. 113. It seems hardly likely that at the stage which has now been reached, Mahomed bin Faser would be deviated from his purpose b}- moral pressure alone. His attitude will probably be that of the Jenebeh in 1865 : “ We have been threatened before. Nothing has happened. We are quite sure nothing will happen now.” 114. It was suggested last year that economic pressure could be brought on the inhabitants of Sur by preventing their dhows from trading in British ports. This was the policy attempted by Napoleon against England. It failed then. I doubt whether it would succeed in the present instance. 115. Naval action has been taken at Sur before, as has been noted in the Historical Summary of the Jenebeh. The presence of a man-of-war would appear to have a good moral effect at the time, but its influence seems to depart as soon as it has steamed out of sight and the incident forgotten as rapidly as the promises made to former Sultans on their visits there. Beyond levying a few fines and possibly destroying a certain amount of property, the result obtained is meagre. It tends to make British merchants at Sur more unpopular than ever with their customers and forces them eventually to seek their means of livelihood elsewhere.! 116. If the administration of Sur is to be brought to that state of 'efficiency which its importance as a trade emporium demands, if the slave trade and arms traffic are to be slopped, and if effective protection is to be afforded to British subjects trading in Sur instead of allowing them to be * * In 1891-2 caravan roads from Sharkiyali to Muscat were closed by Gliafiri tribes, and trade was deviated from that part of the province to Sur, thereby causing a gloomv prospect for Muscat trade. (Administration Report, 1891-2.) t In his letter No. 976 S., dated 28th December 1922, to the address of the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, commenting on the effect of shell fire on Oman tribes ■Colonel Trevor writes :—- “ It will be seen that the operations dragged on from the 18th October until the 2nd November. This was most unexpected as the Muscat Government confidently hoped that the Yal Saad would submit as soon as one of H.M. Ships appeared upon the scene. The Political Agent and I both consider there were good grounds for such a lope, as the last time when the Yal Saad were rebellions the mere threat of bombardment by the then Wazir made them submit and pay their fine at once. I have noticed, however, recently on the Trucial ’Coast that bombardments are not regarded with so much dread as formerly, and that whereas formerly the threat of a bombardment, or at most the firing of one or two rounds, was sufficient to make a Sheikh submit, nowadays it has become necessary to carry out a fairly heavy bombardment to achieve the same result. I can only regard this as one of the unexpected results of the war.” 119 driven out, it would seem necessary to follow the same course as in the case of Muscat and Matrah. The towns have been transformed from armed camps living constantly under the threat of raids, into peaceful and law abiding places as quiet and safe as any town in India. The result has been reached by gradual development of circumstances. Indian troops were landed in 1913, during the rebellion of Sheikh Isa bin Saleh and the Imam of Tanuf, for the protection of Muscat and Matrah in accordance with our undertaking to defend these towns. After one attack in 1915, when he sustained a severe defeat, Sheikh Isa bin Saleh left these places severely alone. After -the Sultan had come to terms with the Imam, a small levy corps under a British officer was formed and paid for by the Muscat Government, and the Indian troops were able to depart. 117. This corps, though very weak numerically, is a constant reminder to the tribes that they cannot raid the place with impunity and their presence is sufficient to restrain any lawless elements there may be in the population. 118. By stationing a battalion of Indian infantry at Sur for a year or two, the same result could presumably be achieved. The Sjate could undertake to build a proper customs house and establish an effect*administration there. Increased customs revenues could be utilised'foc the increase of the strength of the ’Muscat infantry by 100 men, eventually to take the place of the Indian troops as soon as the situation, becomes sufficientjy stabilised. 119. The cost of such a force has been worked out for me in detail by •Captain Walker, Commandant, Muscat Infantry, but I have not thought it necessary to include such details in this report. He estimates initial expenditure, exclusive of quarters, at Rs. 21,170 ; annual expenditure for the first two years, Rs. 00,000 per annum ; annual expenditure subsequently, Rs. 61,400 per annum. customs rs iceipts of Sur amounted to— Rs. Rs. 1921 - 45,531 1925 - 42,751 1922 - 36,376 1926 - 37,813 1928 - 50,728 1927 - 38,802 1924 - 37,457 The above amounts were collected under the conditions described above. If the town were properly under control the customs receipts should uxceed one lakh. 121. With the presence of such troops, it might also be possible to induce the British India Company to send their slow mail steamers to call at Sur. Although the volume of trade would justify this, the opposition of dhow owners and the general insecurity of the place prevents their doing so at present. Such visits would be a great civilising influence 1o the place in addition to furnishing an easy means of access and also furthering British -trade. G. P. MURPHY, Major, Political Agent and H.B.M. Consul, Muscat, Muscat. 9th October 1928.APPENDIX I. Early History of Sur. The name Sur is stated by Colonel Miles to be identical with that of Tyre or Sur in the Mediterranean and to have been its prototype. He therefore ascribes a Phoenician origin to the place.. The Mart of Maceta (mentioned by Arrian in his account of the voyage- of Nearchus), Hereen says, was probably Sur, and he adds that an emporium like this, at the entrance of the Gulf, strengthens our idea of an ancient Indian trade with the Oman coast. At the time of Albuquerque, Sur is described as a small fishing village he passed whilst approaching Muscat. The Portuguese appear to have occupied the place twice, the first period prior to 163d, when they were driven out b.y Naser bin Murshid al Yarraby, again prior to 1648, when one of the conditions imposed by the Arabs on the Portuguese was that the fort of Sur should be surrendered and razed. APPENDIX 2. Wrecks and Piracy. In 1829 the Bani Bu Ali looted a British ship Oscar, which ran ashore on the coast of Jaalan, and plundered cargo to the value of eight lakhs of rupees. The Resident went to Sur, accompanied by H.H. the Sultan, two frigates and a squadron, to recover the property, but succeeded in recovering $12,000 and some shawls only. It was remarked at the time : “ Finding that this Chief and tribe, in consequence of their residing in the interior, were wholly untangible by* naval means alone, the British authority conceived it useless to attempt force and therefore endeavoured to create such an impression on the minds of the inhabitants of this dangerous coast as would be likely to prove highly beneficial to any British ship that might have the misfortune to suffer a similar accident.” (Vide Bombay Government Selections, XXIV, page 199.) In 1833 a piracy attended with cruel and aggravated circumstances, committed on a Cutch Nowry off the coast of Zanzibar, was traced by the Imam to some of the tribes of Sur. He seized the principal offenders and placed them at the disposal of the Resident to be dealt with as he might direct. In 1852 the S.S. Centaur ran ashore near Ras el Hadd. The Bani Bu Ali plundered the whole of her cargo, valued at 10 or 11 lakhs, and destroyed the vessel. In 1904 Jenebeh, of Masirah Island, were responsible for the murder of 17 of the crew of the Baron Inverclyde, which struck a rock near the Kuria Muria Islands. Eight Greeks remained on the ship and were rescued by the S.S. Prome. One ship’s boat was never heard of again. The other boat contained the 17 men mentioned above, who were massacred on attempting to land at Masirah. The ringleaders were shot after trial by the Sultan s Askaris, in the presence of Major Grey, Saiyid Taimur and a party from H.M.S.

I.- -Geographical Description of Sur. 1. Sur is a town of about 12,000 inhabitants situated in the province of Jaalan in Oman, about 17 miles west of Has el Iladd and 94 miles south-east of Unseat. 2. The shore at Sur is low and sandy, destitute both of trees and other vegetation. The principal features of the' place are a creek with the town standing on both sides of the entrance and a stony ridge called Eed, which rises about 50 feet high from shingly flats and runs from north to south at a distance of 2 miles behind the town. The creek is half a mile long, 150 yards wide and only three-quarters of a fathom deep at low water. 3. The town on the east of the creek is called Aiqa and is occupied by the Bani Bu Ali tribe ; that on the west is called Muqrimatain and is occupied by four sections of the Jenebeh tribe. The fighting strength of these sections is stated to be as follows :—Arama, 2,000 ; Makhana, 800 ; Ghialin, 600 ; Fuwaris, 150. 4. Adjoining the north-west end of the stony ridge are Sanaisalah,. occupied by the Bani Sinan, and Shariah, containing 100 houses of the Jenebeh (Arama). 5. On the plain at the back of the ridge, situated about 4 miles from the sea, is Balad As Sur, a stone-built village in which the Walks residence is situated, but in disrepair. There is also a fort named Jinah situated inside Balad As Sur and occupied by the Bani Amr, askaris of the Walk Stated to be the key to the command of Sur. 6. There are extensive date groves and cultivation of lucerne and about 250 houses of various tribes who supply Sur with vegetables and fodder. 7. Balad As Sur contains about 95 wells and the water supply of Sur is obtained from there daily on donkeys. It was in order to keep the town in check by commanding the water supply that this site was chosen as the Walks residence. During hostilities water is also obtained at night with some difficulty from sweet wells to the south of the creek. 8. According to Lorimer’s Gazetteer (Vol. II, p. 1849), there were at one time over 100 Indian traders at Sur, but these numbers gradually dwindled down owing to the insecurity of the place. In 1923 there were 35, at present there are only 20 British subjects in Sur. These British merchants are living on sufferance, having to pay blackmail to the various Sheikhs of the Jenebeh in order to avoid being looted. I understand that since the kidnapping of a Bania in 1926, Mahomed Bin Naser, Amir of the Bani Bu Ali, has not himself levied anything from the Banias, but that he is suspected of instigating others to do so. 9. The climate of the place is stated to be very equable, and were it not for the insecurity trade there would be in a very flourishing condition.* 10. Unlike Muscat, there are roads suitable for wheeled traffic in Muqrimatain. The track between Muqrimatain and Balad As Sur would require some labour on it near Sanaisalah before it could be used for wheeled traffic. 10a. Sur is the port for the shipment of dates from Sharqiyah. Most of these dates are of the Mibsali variety, which is preferred by natives of the country to all other kinds and is much appreciated in India. The trade is a large one, the Badiyah division of Sharqiyah alone containing some 158,000 palms. 10b. The carrier trade from Sharqiyah to Sur is in the hands of the Hijriyin tribe, whilst the Jenebeh of Sur, who are a seafaring tribe and own some 130 dhows, convey them thence to Bombay and other ports. * The total number of Sur dhows is estimated at 150. Most of these belong to the Jenebeh tribe. The Bani Bu. Ali own 8 or 10, and a few are owned by the Bani Sinan.4 10c. A small number of Jenebeli belonging to the Majaala section live at Izz near Nezwa, and in former days the Temeemah or Chief Sheikh of the Jenebeh was chosen from this section. He was regarded with veneration, had despotic power, and took 25 per cent, on all bags of dates exported by the tribe. Presumably he acted as agent for the Jenebeh in ■Sharqiyah and helped to build up this trade. By 1900 his power had waned and a Sheikh of the Arama section, who are the largest section in Sur, was recognised as Temeemah. Unfortunately a blood feud, which started in 1913, between the Arama and Fuwaris sections on the one hand and the Makhana and Ghialin on the other, undermined the influence of the Arama Sheikh and Mansur bin Naser of the Majaala section of Masirah Island was elected Temeemah. The influence of this Sheikh over the Arama and Fuwaris sections waned, and he seems to have enlisted the sympathy of the Amirs of the Bani Bu Ali tribe for the purpose of regaining his authority. In 1927 he went to Mecca with the brothers of Amir Mahomed bin Naser to visit Ibn Saud, but died of smallpox on the return journey. The Jenebeh, though they bear an evil reputation in slave dealing and piracy, are not a warlike race, and under normal circumstances could have been kept in control easily enough ; but misrule, internal feuds and French influence have combined to let loose lawless elements amongst them. 10d. The Bani Bu Ali, as a tribe, live in the interior of Jaalan. Their principal port is Lashkharah, but they have a small settlement at Aiqa on the opposite side of Sur creek to the Jenebeh and own about eight or ten dhows. According to Saiyid Mahomed bin Ahmed, Aiqa formerly belonged to the Hinawi. The Temeemah of the Bani Bu Ali, Mahomed bin Majid, occupied it under their patronage, but Abdullah bin Salim threw off the Hinawi connection and made the place purely a Bani Bu Ali settlement. The Bani Bu Ali are a wild and warlike tribe of ruffians. They put up a fight against a Division of Indian troops, and their name is to be found on the colours of a number of Indian regiments. The Sultans of Muscat ha\e never been able to control them, but have often enlisted their assistance Muring former rebellions, when they have come chiefly for the sake of loot. II.—Historical Summary of the Bani Bu Ali. 11. The Bani Bu All tribe of Jaalan are a branch of the i^reat Adnani tribe Bani Temeem. ^ m 12. The name Bani Bu Ali appears to be of recent origin, since in the i of the Imams and Se yy id s of Oman,” by Salil ibn Razik, translated by the Rev. G. P. Badger, they are constantly being referred to as the Beni lemeem, and not as the Bani Bu Ali. 13. The Bani Temeem, one of the most considerable tribes in Arabia ascribe their origin to Temim—born about A.D. 120—the son of Murr a descendant of Madhar through Tabikhah, and therefore of the race of Adnan and Maadd. They were dispersed over the north-east of Nejd from the bjnan desert to the borders of the el l ainamali. Their territory comprised ^vast desert called Dahna, and extended on the south between the confines of A1 Yamamah and el Bahrain. 14. The Bani Bu Ali are accounted the most religious tribe in the Oman oultanate. they belong to the Wahabi sect known as Azraqah and will not eat meat cooked by others. The founders of the Wahabi, Ibadhi, and lufuwah sects all belonged to the Beni Temeem, whilst the Harth, the other branch Intrigue accomplished what force failed to do.5 During the Wahabi invasion of 18.12-3, Salim bin Ali, Temeemah Sheikh of the Bani Bn Ali, became their supporter, helping them against the Bani Bit Hassan. In consequence of the part which Salim bin Ali had taken against the Bani Bit Hassan, there was a feud between the two tribes which resulted in a light wherein Salim bin Ali and some of his people were killed ; some of the Bani Bu llassan also fell, and as neither side would give in, the war between them continued, and has been carried on more or less constantly ever since. 16. Mahomed bin Ali, who succeeded Salim bin Ali as Temeemah, seceded from the tenets of the Ibadiyah and adopted those of the Wahabi, throwing oh the authority of the Imam. 17. In 1820 Saiyid Said, having heard that Mahomed bin Ali had induced many of the inhabitants of Jaalan to adopt his creed, and that his followers among the A1 Ashkarah had plundered many English ships wrecked there, applied to the English to aid him in an expedition against Mahomed bin Ali and his confederates. The Bani Bu Ali murdered the messenger carrying a letter to the chiefs from the British party investigating reports of piracy near Ras el Hadd. Captain Thompson, in charge of operations, decided to avenge the act, and with a small force consisting of six companies, sailed to Muscat, where plans were made for the Sultan to reinforce him at Sur. The combined force marched on Balad Bani Bu Ali, the capital of the tribe, but proved entirely inadequate, and after attempting to take the town, were sharply repulsed. Six out of eight officers and 270 men were killed. In January 1821 Major-General Sir Lionel Smith sailed with two brigades to restore British influence in the gulf. From Sur, they also marched to Balad Bani Bu Ali, which surrendered after most of the defending force had been killed or captured. The Sheikh, Mahomed bin Ali, w r as deported to Bombay. (Frontier and Overseas Expeditions from India, Vol. YT.)* 18. As late as 18-15 the Bani Bu Ali were strict if not fanatical in the observance of the Wahabi principles. They have since relaxed something of their rigour and have resumed the smoking of tobacco, but they continue to be exact in their observance of the forms and times of prayer. (Lorimer, Vol. II., p. 66.) 19. In 1854 Sultan Saiyid Said stated that the Bani Bu Ali had long withdrawn from allegiance to him. 20. In the early part of the reign of Saiyid Thoweynee [1856-66] the Bani Bu Ali and the Bani Bu Hassan were almost constantly engaged in petty skirmishes against each other, in which Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim, the grandson of Mahomed bin Ali, at the head of the Bani Bu Ali, generally won the day. About the same time a series of raids was committed by the Wahibah against the Bani Bu Ali, these raids culminating in a serious engagement at Theeleyeh, in which Sheikh Abdulla greatly distinguished himself by totally defeating and routing the enemy.f 21. Towards Saiyid Thoweynee his attitude was that of neutrality, but Saiyid Salim during his reign [1866-8], having had reason to suspect treachery on the part of the Hinawi garrison at Muscat, sent a large present to Sheikh Abdulla and requested his help to defend him in his position. Sheikh Abdulla gladly removed to Muscat with 300 men and garrisoned it, ibut, owing to the vadilatory policy of Saiyid Salim, was dismissed after a stay of four months and returned to Jaalan. Soon after this, Saiyid Azzan- bin-Khais, on coming to power in 1868, summoned him and the other Sheikhs of the Bani Bu Ali to Muscat to render their submission, and on their having refused to visit him, he marched against the Bani Bu Ali, seized three of the Sheikhs of the tribe and threw them into prison at Muscat. * A good description of these operations and the subsequent proceedings is contained in the Annual Administration Reports. 1883-4. page 26. t Abdulla bin Salim was not actually Temeemah of the Bani Bu Ali till 1867, in which year the Temeemah Mahomed bin Majid was murdered; but he certainly took, a very prominent part in affairs before that date.H ■■ ■ : ■■ ■■■ 6 22. Concerning this expedition Colonel Pelly, then Political Resident in the Gulf, wrote at the time (No. 202, dated 3rd November 1809) : ‘“If Saiyid Azan bin Khais should succeed in his present expedition in the south, he would be likely to strengthen his authority so considerably as to be able to keep a firmer grasp on Muscat territory than any other aspirant to power could.” 23. Sheikh Abdulla, however, managed to remain at liberty and thwart the Mutawwa power in every possible way. This led Saiyid Azzan to instigate the Bani Bu Hassan and the A1 Wahibah to wage war against the Bani Bu Ali. A serious engagement took place at Lazzeh, in which Abdulla defeated the two Hinawi tribes, and in revenge for this the Bani Bu Hassan rose again, only to be defeated a second time at Seh A1 Masaddee. 24. In 1870, Saiyid Turki having requested the help of the Bani Bu Ali, they joined him at Sur, and 200 of their number marched under Sheikh Abdulla and Yusuf against Matrah, where they both took a leading part in scaling the wall and in the engagement which resulted in the death of Saiyid Azzan-bin-Khais, and subsequent^ restoring order and holding the place till Saiyid Turki’s arrival from Sur. In recognition of their services Saiyid Turki granted the Amirs of the Bani Bu Ali exemption from the payment of customs on the goods imported by them into Sur. 25. In 1874 the Bani Bu Ali had at length amicably adjusted an internecine feud that had been going on amongst themselves for some time. The number of slain on each side being equal, each party forgave the other, and as regards wounded (about 70 in number), the blood money was determined by Mahomedan Law. 26. In 1874 Bani Bu Ali of the Ja’afarah section, belonging to Lashkharah, were responsible for the wrongful confinement and subsequent release on ransom of subjects of the Rao of Cutch at Hellanujah Island. Major Miles w T ent to Lashkharah in H.M.S. Philomel, and as the surrender of the actual offenders could not be obtained, a fine of $600 was imposed and readily paid at Sur by Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim of the Bani Bu Ali, acting on behalf of the Ja’afarah.* 27. In 1881 the Bani Bu Ali attacked and defeated the Bani Bu Hassan in their own quarter of Jawabi al Khwarah. This engagement was described as the most sanguinary ever fought between Omani tribes, and is said to have cost 157 killed on both sides. 28. In 1887 the Awlad Kassib kidnapped one Bania at Sur and had severely beaten another. Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim of his own accord restored the kidnapped Bania and imprisoned five of the Awlad Kassib.| 28a. In 1888-9 relations between the Bani Bu Ali and Jenebeh were strained.^ In May 1889 hostilities broke out, which resulted in a fight of some importance. Badr bin Saif, who went there to settle the dispute, reported on return that the Bani bu Ali had agreed to allow the passage of the creek at Sur to remain entirely in the hands of His Hio-hness’s officials, and to abide by the decision of the Sultan in ali local matters. 29. In 1895 the. Bani Bu Ali sent a detachment in support of Saiyid Faisal when he was attacked at Muscat by Saleh bin Ali, but they made no determined effort to expel the rebels and recover the capital for their sovereign. _ In recognition of their services Saiyid Faisal granted the Amirs of the Bani Bu Ali an allowance of $100 per mensem. 30.. In the spring of 1903, the ordinary annual hostilities between the Ghafiris and Hinawis of Sharqiyah being then in progress, Abdulla bin Salim found reason to suspect that the people of Sur, though Ghafiris were supplying his enemies with the sinews of war. He accordingly marched down the coast and declared the harbour blockaded until his demands for satisfaction were complied with. After Abdulla had returned to the interior, relations between his supporters in the Aiqa quarter and his opponents in- Muqraimatain became so strained that when Major Cox (then * For full details vide “ Narrative of Muscat Affairs,” 1874-5 (sic ), para, 343 f The Awlad Kassib were originally a Fakhth of the Jenebeh. but carue protection of the Bani Bu Ali. under the IPolitical Agent, Muscat) arrived there in August he found the two factions on the point of opening fire on each other across the intervening creek. The Political Agent, having obtained a truce for 48 hours, returned at once to Muscat and informed the Sultan, who immediately proceeded to the spot. The Jenebeh would not at once submit to his mediation, and before proceedings had commenced in earnest the Sultan was called away by serious news from Pustaq ; nevertheless, his visit actually averted fighting for the moment, and the dispute was adjusted, not long after, by neutral Sheikhs of the neighbour hood. (Lorimer, Vol. I, p. 580.) 31. In 1913 Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim A1 Alawi died. He was considered a very daring man, well disposed towards the Sultans of Muscat, and always ready to help them. His eldest son Naser had predeceased him, and as the latter’s son Mahomed was still a minor, Abdulla’s second son Ali was made Amir jointly with Mahomed bin JNaser. An arrangement which still continues. 32. During the 1913-9 rebellion the Pani Bu Ali took the part of the Sultan, but their behaviour was not altogether satisfactory. They sent the rice given them for their progress inland, to their homes at Sur and also left behind the ammunition, with which the Sultan had provided them, at Muscat for taking to their homes at the first convenient •opportunity, and then on their arrival at Sib were demanding extra supplies of both food and ammunition. They retreated unexpectedly and unaccountably from Bidbid, where they were first established, to Watiyah. On being brought back to Muscat much alarm was felt owing to their reputation for looting and general misbehaviour. Their counsels were divided, they quarrelled bitterly amongst themselves and paid little attention to the authority of their nominal leader, Mahomed bin Naser, and it was only with great difficulty that they could be induced to obey orders of any kind. In one quarrel amongst themselves, which arose over pilfering by some of them in the bazaar whom the Sheikh wished to punish, stones and sticks were freely used, with the result that there were several heads broken. Even the Sheikh himself was stoned. 33. Since the time Mahomed bin Naser started to assert his authority, relations between the Amirs and the Sultan have undergone a change. In 1920 the Wazir cut the allowances paid to the Bani Bu Ali through misdirected economy, but Mr. Wingate* restored them. 34. In 1923 the Amirs sent a petition to Government claiming that the port of Sur belonged to them and that the Sultan had nothing to do with the said port; that the Sultan did not supply them with arms and ammunition according to agreement, and asking that they might enter into direct relations with the Government of India. Government replied that they were unable to intervene on their behalf. This claim to independence on the part of the Amirs of Jaalan appears to be based on the compact entered into by the Wahabi Sheikh on his invasion of Oman, when certain Sheikhs were constituted Ameers or territorial lords in their own right without any dependence on Muscat (Bombay Government Records, XXIV, p. 43). 35. In 1924 Mahomed bin Naser informed Major Hinde* that he was authorised by the Muscat Government to settle all disputes in Sur and had succeeded in doing so with the exception of Khamis bin Mubarak of the Arama section. From the records of the Council of Ministers it appears that Mahomed bin Naser wrote to the Sultan in March 1924 offering to effect a settlement between the Jenebeh sections. The Sultan replied, permitting him to interfere during the Salifah period, but after this period he was not to interfere in anything. 39. Major Hinde then enquired how it was that the Sheikh did not permit the new customs house to be built at Sur. Mahomed bin Naser became evasive and said nothing had ever been settled about it, finally denying that he had ever agreed to its being built and stating that he never would * Then Political Agent, Muscat.8 « agree. He went on to say that the right of His Highness to collect customs at Sur and Aiqa had never been recognised by his forbears, himself or his tribe. 37. In 1925 Colonel Prideaux (then Political Resident in the Gulf) remarked that the Amirs were not very loyal to the Sultan and that if , they had done their duty and given the Wali of Sur all the support he was entitled to there would have been no question of paying a ransom for the release of a Hindu who was kidnapped by a Bedouin. 38. In December 1925, in protesting against having to obtain a “No- Objection ” certificate from the Political Agent before being allowed to import arms and ammunition from Bombay, Mahomed bin Naser wrote to the Government of India : “ I submit that this request of the Political Department of Bombay is not fair to me as a ruler of an independent State, and it would be highly detrimental to my dignity to ask for consent or certificate from the Political Agent, Muscat. I hold the Political Agent in high regard, but I think you will appreciate that I prefer to preserve the dignity of my State not to do an act detrimental to its independent possession.” 39. Mahomed bin Naser has as his lieutenants (1) Abdulla bin Saleh, a Habshi, who was his agent in Bombay, speaks English and is reputed to have drafted Mahomed bin Naser’s letter to the Government of India. He is stated to be very unreliable ; (2) Mahomed bin Said, a Syrian whom he engaged about December 1927 to teach his children. Reputed to know a little English and to be much travelled. III.—Historical Summary of the Jenebeh. 40. Little is traceable concerning the early history of this tribe. According to Colonel Miles, they are a branch of the Bani Jabir and, therefore, Wilad Dhubyan of Kahtanate origin, but now classed as Ghafiri. They are considered the least religious tribe in Oman, and in this connection it would be interesting to trace whether there is any connection between them and Abu Said al Hassan, el Janaby, the Karmaty, who abolished prayer and fasting and the pilgrimage and attacked the Hajj and invaded Oman about the year A.D. 900. 41. A violent grudge of old standing between the Jenebeh and the Harth (the tribe of Sheikh Isa bin Saleh—the strong man of the Imam’s Government), culminating in an affray near Khaburah in which the Jenebeh were the victors, is mentioned as taking place in the early part of the reign of Saiyid Said (1807-56), whilst they were assisting the latter in his opera tions against the Wahabis. Later they appear to have assisted the Wahabis in conjunction with Mahomed bin Nasir al Jabir against Saiyid Said. Later still they appear once more to have assisted Saiyid Said against the Wahabis. 42. In 1865 the Jenebeh of Sur, discontented with the Sultan’s rule, sought Wahabi assistance from Baraimi ; and the Wahabi agent, nothing loth, sent a contingent, who plundered Suq Sur, assisted by the Jenebeh and Bani Bu Ali. Nearly all the damage inflicted fell on Hindu traders and shopkeepers ; the extent of their losses was estimated at $27,700 and one of their number was killed and another wounded. Before being allowed to leave for Muscat, they were stripped of almost all their clothing.| 43. Colonel Pelly considered that a prompt and severe example should be made of the Jenebeh, who were implicated with the Wahabis in the plunder and murder of our subjects at Sur. There were other reasons too which called for the punishment of this tribe. They had long been notorious among our naval officers as the most cruel and unscrupulous slavers and pirates. They were among the Arab slave dealers who had conspired in 1861 to assassinate the British Agent at Zanzibar for his anti-slavery proceedings. It was also believed that they were concerned in the murder of three seamen of H.M.S. Wasp, who had disappeared from * * They were in league with the Bani Jahir for many years, following their fortunes- vis-a-vis the Wahabis. t For fuller details vide “Muscat audits Relations with the Wahabi Power.”9 their craft a few months before. The Sultan of Muscat was assured of their criminality and had himself proceeded to Sur five or six months previously with the intention of punishing them, but was obliged to return to Muscat owing to a conspiracy to dethrone him. Colonel Felly had also in the preceding month sent the Berenice to Sur with a letter addressed to the heads of the Jenebeh demanding payment of $27,000 as compensation for the property plundered by them from Briiish subjects and warning them that measures would be taken to enforce the demand. Their reply .was that on a former occasion when Lieut. Pengelly threatened a tribe on the coast nothing was done, and they were quite sure the Resident would not’ come now. ? . 44. On the 11th February 18Gb II.M.S. Highflyer appeared off Sur to- insist on atonement by the Jenebeh for their part in the affairs of August, by payment of $27,700 compensation within 24 hours. On the tribe attempting to procrastinate, a tire was opened which demolished their fort, the whole of their boats were either confiscated or burnt, and a large quantity of their ship timber was burnt. No personal injury was suffered by non-combatants, who had ample opportunity to move, but a small part of the town was burnt accidentally in consequence of a change in the direction of the wind. 45. In the month of June 1875 a godown belonging to the principal Indian trader of Sur, a Bania named Jethhand Motamull, was broken into during his absence on business at Muscat by a party of Jenebeh, who offered violence to the watchman in charge and carried off plunder to the value of about $1,600. The spoil was openly sold in the town and the robbers made no attempt at concealment of themselves, but no steps wero taken by the Sheikhs of the tribe to cause restitution, and it does not even appear that they offered to remonstrate with or suppress their tribesmen. There was no Wall or other authority on behalf of the Sultan at Sur at the time who could have taken action in the matter. The Bania therefore reported the matter to Colonel Miles and the case was referred to His- Highness, who promised redress. 46. Soon after this, H.M.S. Irifleman happened to arrive at Sur, and the Sheikhs of the Jenebeh, apprehensive that her arrival was connected with the outrage committed by their tribesmen, and fearing the results, seized the offender, and would have doubtless caused restitution, but H.M.S. Rifle man, which only dropped anchor for a few hours incidentally in passing, having in the meantime weighed anchor, the Sheikhs perceived how matters stood and released their tribesmen without further question. 47. During His Highness Saiyid Turki’s absence in Gwadur, the case was presented to Saiyid Abdul Aziz, but without beneficial result. About this time the Sheikhs of the tribe went to the Bania and offered an arrangement promising to make good the loss in eight months. This arrangement they afterwards repudiated. Saiyid Turk! was reminded of the matter after his return, but he was not able to put sufficient pressure on the tribe to cause them to make good the loss or to bring them to account for their misconduct, and they succeeded in procrastinating and delaying to reply until the season opened and they could get away in their bughlahs. 48. His Highness finally informed Colonel Miles that he left the matter in the hands of Government, and as the latter considered the continued failure of the Jenebeh tribe to cause restitution to a British subject plundered by them injurious to British interests, he supported His Highness’s request that the enforcement of reparations might be undertaken by Government. To have held His Highness personally responsible for the loss sustained at the Jenebeh’s hands would have tended still further to weaken His Highness’s authority, and would have encouraged the predatory Arabs to continue their depredations on British subjects at His Highness’s expense whilst the exaction of reparation from this tribe would, on the other hand, be a cautionary warning to all. Colonel W. F. Prideaux, the Political Resident, also suggested that in addition to the original amount a fine of $2,000 should be levied on the Jenebeh, partly as compensation for the delay and partly as a penalty for the offence committed against a British subject. 3393 B10 49. At first, however, the Government of India would not comply with the Sultan’s request, claiming that the repression of crime and the punishment of criminals was the duty of the Sultan, and that in return for the responsibility which it has incurred in guaranteeing to Saiyid Turki the payment of the Zanzibar subsidy and for other material aid which had been afforded to Saiyid lurki from time to time, the Government of India might fairly expect that the punishment of offenders in Oman would be effectually carried out, in so far at least as offences against British subjects were concerned, without requisitions being made on the British Government for armed intervention. 50. 1 he Sultan s efforts to comply with this attitude of Government were so feeble and ineffective that finally m July 1877 the Political Agent was authorised by Government to proceed to Sur in H.M.S. Teazev and convey the Sultan’s demands. 51. When the Political Agent arrived at Sur on the 24th July he wrote to the Jenebeh enclosing His Highness’s order and warned them that if they failed to comply within 24 hours, measures of a coercive nature would follow. The Jenebeh had no recognised head at the time, the nominal Sheikh being a boy as yet without authority, but several of the leading men came on board in reply to the letter. They expressed their readiness to comply with His Highness’s order, but explained that the absence of a recognised authority amongst them rendered it necessary for each membei of the tribe to pay his share at once, as, were some to pay on behalf of the rest, (heir chance of reimbursement would be small. On this ground, and on the ground that several of their principal men were inland fighting against the Baui Bu Hassan, they asked for an extension of time and were allowed until sunset on the 25th. .52. By noon of the 25th, Jethanand’s claim amounting to $1,600 had been satisfied partly by a money payment and partly by a buggalow (or native dhow), of which he had received possession. At sunset the Governor of Sur and Jethanand came on board. The former delivered to the Political Ao-ent $2,000 and the latter stated that his claim against the Jenebeh had been fully satisfied. Government expressed satisfaction with the results obtained and directed that the fine of $2,000 should be paid to Saiyid Turki, after deducting the expenses incurred in the measures which had been taken. 53. In 1885 Saiyids Faisal and Fahd went to Sur to endeavour to obtain payment of certain customs duty from the Jenebeh but were unsuccessfuh o4. In 1898 Suleiman bin Suweylim , who was the Sultan’s Wall of JJnofar, bur, and Sohar, went to Sur, where the inhabitants were benm encouraged by french agency to make light of the Sultan’s authority. He summoned the Sheikhs of the Jenebeh and informed them that in future he would not respect Khafir and would seize the persons and property of those who belonged to tnhra whom he considered unfriendly, even if in the house of the Khafir himself (When a party or caravan wish to pass through the country of another tribe, they take with them as escort a man belongimr to the tribe through whose country they wish to pass. The party or •caravan is then safe from attack, and this is known as the “ Khafir’’’system. It is respected to such an extent that members of a tribe travelling under tins protection through the country of a tribe with which they even have a blood feud, are safe.) 55. This aroused the greatest indignation amongst the Jenebeh. Suleiman then proceeded to Muscat, leaving his son, a lad of 12 or 13 years, in charo-g of the p ace. Later he wrote to his son at Sur, ordering him to build a fort at a spot which would at once command both the water supply of the town and the caravan route to the interior. Such a fort would have enabled ie bultaii to overcome the Jenebeh and ensure a large increase in the revenue derived from the customs at Sur. About this time Suleiman’s son threatened to shoot a gardener, and actually did shoot a bullock and cut11 down a date tree belonging to the gardener, because the latter refused to- supply him with some green grass, which he was keeping for his own camels. 56. The four sections of the Jenebeh then combined and wrote letters to the Saltan asking him to stop the building of the fort and remove Suleiman’s son from Sur. The Sultan did not reply to these letters. Five of the Sheikhs then came to Muscat and placed their complaints before the Sultan, but His Highness turned a deaf ear and they went away disappointed. 57. At length, after representations from several quarters, His Highness sent his writer Hamad to Sur to listen to the complaints of the Jeuebeh and stop the building of the fort. No attention was paid by Suleiman’s son to this order, and on Hamad’s return His Highness did not even take the trouble to hear his report. 58. Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim of the Bani Bu Ali now intervened and induced the Sultan to stop the building of the fort, but the Jenebek insisted on the recall of Suleiman’s son and said they were quite prepared to fight rather than submit to Suleiman’s rule. 59. The Jenebeh then cut off the supplies of the garrison. The Sultan at once wrote to the Jenebeh warning them that their attitude, if persisted in, would only resqlt in speedy and condign punishment. The Sultan’s messenger was informed by the Sheikhs that unless he left Sur before nightfall, his blood would be on his own head. 60. It was difficult to understand why the Sultan persisted in trying to* force Suleiman bin Suweylim’s unpopular and high handed rule on the Jenebeh against their will. He had neither money nor troops with which to coerce the tribe. Any man he could raise would come out, not for the purpose of fighting, but merely to live at His Highness’s expense ; whilst the Jenebeh, though not a martial tribe, were well armed and had sntficient money to induce other tribes to join them. 61. At length, towards the end of September, a force consisting of 600 Jenebeh, 200 Bani Bu Ali and 150 Bani Rasib beleaguered the fort occupied by the Sultan’s representative. The rebels opened fire at long range and the garrison replied. This lasted for three hours without resulting in any loss for either side, when it suddenly seemed to strike one of the Sheikhs that some members of his tribe were in the fort. The Sheikh thereupon advanced up to the walls under a flag of truce and called upon the garrison to surrender. A parley then ensued and an agreement was arrived at, the rebels guaranteeing that the Wall’s son and the beleaguered garrison would be escorted in safety to the coast and placed on board a vessel bound for Muscat. The fort was accordingly evacuated and the party despatched to Muscat. 62. Before returning to their homes the rebels destroyed the new and half built fort referred to above. The Sheikhs wrote to the Sultan offering to hand over the fort to anyone deputed by him except Suleiman bin Suweylim or his son, and the Sultan despatched a fresh garrison under Hamad bin Saif. The Sultan wrote a conciliatory letter to the Sheikhs, informing them that he pardoned them for their late act of rebellion, but the Sheikhs, not convinced of his bond fides, refused to allow Hamad to take over the fort and he returned to Muscat. 63. At the end of the year the Jenebeh were persuaded to accept a new Wall, and Sheikh Muhammad bin Hamad (the present Wali of Matrah and President of the Council; and a fresh garrison of 60 men took possession of the fort. The fort was found to have been entirely dismantled ; all the woodwork had been removed and nothing left but the bare walls. 64. During this period the authority of the Sultan was being further undermined as a result of French intrigue. A plan of the harbour at Sur, published by the French Government in 1901, showed that their attention had been directed to that place at some earlier date, and in 1893 M. Chapui, a somewhat disreputable French subject, arrived at Sur in a steamer flying the French flag and tried to obtain a site for a coal shed there.12 The scheme for advancing French interests by a wide distribution of the French flag was boldly pursued. In November 1891 it was stated that as many as 50 Sur boats flying the French flag were bound for Bushire and 18 had put in to Lingah. (Ihis question is further dealt with in the review ■of the slave trade.) By 1900 the people of Sur, especially those of the denebeh tribe, had almost ceased, under Irench encouragement, to regard the Bultan as their master. 65. In 1900 Hilal bin Amr arrived at Sur from East Africa, joined hands with M. Ottavi, and began to inveigh against the Sultan and the British , and the spirit of the denebeh was such that, when summoned by the Sultan to meet him at Muscat, they refused to go and insolently that he should deal with them instead through the French Vice-Consul. It was this state of affairs which obliged Saiyid Faisal in June 1900 to make a visit to Sur, the first since his accession in 1888. His reception was more favourable than he had expected, for all the elders of the town immediately paid their respects to him, the Cheif Sheikh of the Bam Bu Ah came down from the interior with a thousand men to do him honour, and the Sultan was successful, before he left, in obtaining from the French flag holders of the port, including the Jenebeh, a formal profession of allegiance to himself and a renunciation of French protection. ,, ^ Jl \ 1 ^ 01 ^ SQl hm sent 80 Askaris to garrison his post at Sur, and the french flag holders, few of whom had observed their promise mven in the previous year, understanding the act as a threat to themselvel, asked v uttavi whether he would protect them in case of an attack by the Sultan’s troops; his reply was unfavourable, and the incident marked another stuee -m the decline of French influence at Sur. 67. About 191.) a blood feud started between the Arama and Makhana sections of the Jenebeh, which has continued ever since. In 1918 His Highness tlie. Sultan visited Sur and fined the Jenebeh Rs. 14 000 and imprisoned 26 Sheikhs. This action kept the peace for about two years.' 68. In 1919 the Muscat customs were reorganised and the people of Sur ■seeing that m future the dues would be more strictly enforced refused to allow a customs house to be built. In 1920 Captain MacCollum, the then Wazir, went to Sur m H.M.S. Bmtomart, and the Jenebeh agreed to accent the new arrangements. Things went smoothly for a short while and then smuggling began again and has continued ever since. The customs house was not built, difficulties being invariably placed in the wav, and the Wali became as powerless and inept as ever. G9 Spasmodic murdering went on, and in 1923 the Council of Ministers sent Sheikh Rashid, Minister for Religious Affairs, to attempt to put an end to the feuds. He returned, having been openly flouted and having accomplished nothing. In July Zubair, Minister of Justice, accompanied by Captain Alban, l.A. (in command of the Muscat Levies) and 150 levies and three machine guns, proceeded to Sur and occupied the fort. Zubair renorted that lie had settled all feuds and caused blood money to be paid over immediately m his presence and recovered $6,400 customs dues from the merchants and fined the tribe $4,000. A site was selected for a custom house and the party returned to Muscat m triumph. Unfortunatelv there was one case in which blood money was not accepted. The Makhana agreed to pardon t 1 qt&gt;l nU lf eI p r ’ an Alam ®- 1Je p s imprisoned in Muscat and was released in 19_4. Meeting an armed slave of the murdered Sheikh on the outskirts of Sur he decided the man had been detailed to kill him and fired and killed the hlave. Ibis started indiscmmnate firing between the sections, in which one Arama boy was killed. The Fuwaris took a hand and seized a water donkey belonging to the Arama, and a struggle ensued, in which an Arama girl was armistice! ^ ^ ^ the Kamzan feast for arranging a 45 days’ 70 About this time (1924) Mahomed bin Naser, Amir of the Bani Bu Ali s arted to take an interest, in the affairs of the Jenebeh, having formed an alliance with Mansur bin Naser, Jenebeh Sheikh of Masirah, and won over the Makhana and A1 Ohialin sections in Sur—the weaker party in the feud .among the Jenebeh—to acknowledge bis authority.13 71. In 1925 Sheikh Mansur bin Naser, of Masirah Island, proceeded to :Sur and informed the Hindu community that there was no Sultan’s Government in Sur, and that tliey were to look to him for justice. He tried to form a committee of leading men for the administration of justice as the local Wali had been found incapable. The Wali told the Hindus that he was powerless and that they should inform the British Government. 72. In 1927 Sheikh Mansur bin Naser of Masirah, accompanied by Hamdan bin Naser and Salim bin Naser, brothers of Mahomed bin Naser of the Bani Bu Ali, stayed at Mecca for three months as the guests of His Majesty Ibn Sand. Mansur bin Naser died of smallpox on the return journey. IY.—The Slave Trade at Sur. 73. British efforts for the suppression of the slave trade first took shape in 1822 by a treaty concluded with Saiyid Said of Muscat, the object being the extinction of the slave trade between Africa and India. This treaty was amplified in 1838-9. Another agreement was made in 1845. Again in 1873 a new treaty was made. 74. The Resident in the Gulf, writing in 1844, says, “ Muscat and Sur are the principal primary ports to which slaves from whencesoever shipped, whether from Zanzibar or the Red Sea, are brought.” In the ’sixties the Political Agent in Muscat estimated that about, 4,000 out of 15,000 slaves passing up the Gulf were landed either at Ras el Hadd or the adjacent port of Sur. 75. In 1852 the steam vessel Tigris was placed on special duty at the •entrance to the Gulf, but it soon became evident that surveillance would be more effective if instituted on the African coast. 76. In the ’seventies somewhat greater success attended the efforts of H.M.S. Magpie and Vulture, sent to cruise off Ras el Hadd. The latter •captured a large dhow, in which were 169 slaves, mostly women and children. The Nakhoda of the vessel was imprisoned by the Sultan of Muscat, and the vessel destroyed. From a description in the Times of India (October 1872) of a slave vessel captured by the Vulture, the methods of the exporters appear to have been characterised by great barbarity. “ The number of slaves it was impossible at the time to estimate ; so crowded on deck and in the hold below was the dhow, that it seemed, but for the aspect of misery, a very nest of ants. The hold, from which an intolerable stench proceeded, was several inches deep in the most foul bilge water and refuse. Down below, there were numbers of children in the most loathsome stages of smallpox and scrofula of every description. A more disgusting and degrading spectacle of humanity could not be seen, while the foulness of the dhow was such that the sailors could hardly endure it. When the slaves were transferred to the Vulture the poor wretched creatures were so dreadfully emaciated and weak that many had to be carried on board and lifted for every movement. How it was that so many survived such hardships was a wonder to ali. . . . But perhaps the most atrocious piece of cruelty of the Arabs was heard afterwards from the slaves themselves, viz., that at the first discovery of smallpox among them by the Arabs, all ^ the affected slaves were at once thrown overboard, and this was continued day by day until, they said, 40 had perished in this manner.” 77. In 1873 H.M.S. London was stationed at Zanzibar for 10 years, and during that period the wholesale traffic was for the time being suppressed. But slaves still arrived in the Persian Gulf in small lots and dealers had begun to conceal their operations by use of the French flag, which secured them against search by British vessels. In the ’eighties there was a recrudescence of the trade owing to the withdrawal of H.M.S. London from Zanzibar. 78. Inquiry showed that slaves were brought to Sur in vessels belonging to that port, most of which flew French colours. The slaves were ordinarily landed at Sur itself, but the owners of the vessels had accomplices ..at Ras el Hadd and other places, and when British cruisers appeared they14 received warning and landed them at small places near by, whence the slaves were marched in gangs to Sur. The demand in the interior behind bur is not great, for the system of irrigation- in Jaalan and Sharkiyah does not demand slave labour. The majority of the slaves are re-exported in small vessels to the Batmeh, where irrigation is mostly from wells and where some of them are retained. The balance is distributed from the oatineh to the irucial coast by land. At this time the number imported here annually was estimated at 300. The Jenebeh tribe proclaimed Spenly that their only object m taking the French flag was to protect their slaving operations. ° /9. Sur^ quickly attained a disreputable prominence in the traffic and it became increasingly clear that the only way to put an end to it was to feLir . de P ot ; 4 bllt the c^ef obstacle to such a step was the attitude of Pranee in regard to her flag. Political difficulties arose owing to the extent to which the protection o£ the French flag was being abused. SO. From 1892 onwards abundant evidence was forthcoming of the abuse of. the Irench flag by importers. In 1896 several vessels carrying slaves were captured In May the Political Agent captured a vessel canying p n aves ' A e '' 1 ' oA A er F M ; S - La V wm&lt; J captured a vessel carryinf 4 slaves, whilst the Sultan s oflicials rescued two recentlv imported slaves at Bunder Gisseb.

The Sultan was assured bv the Government of India that Ins subjects could not be removed from his jurisdiction but the precanousness of his position at Sur and his fear of the French Government deterred him from taking any action. government 62. In 1900 Captain P. Z. Cox, then Political Agent, Muscat, re-examined W1 q i“ eStl ° n ° * he , “cportation of slaves. He found that about 1,000 slaves had been imported that year into Sur, of which about half had been carried in vessels under the French flag.

Summary of recent Events in Sur. 85. In 1927 the Arama and Makhana sections of the Jenebeh each hnilt ice new forts m their quarters against the orders of the Wali 86 In August 1937 Mr. Thomas, Minister of Finance went to Sur IT. attempted to induce the Jenebeh to pay 2 4 lakhs of rupeeTwhich they ow^Khan Bahadur Kasib and Ali Musa Khan, merchants of Muscat, and to pull down the forts which they had built. It appeared to Mr. Thomas that the opposition to this came mainly from the Arama section, and on leaving iSur, in the Al Saeed, he took in tow an Arama sambuk, which was in the harbour, whereupon the Arama fired on the Al Saeed. Beyond hitting the funnel .and one of the ship’s boats, no damage was done. The fire was not returned. The Council fined the Arama section Us. 10,000, but have been unable to enforce this. 87. In April 1928 the Amirs of the Bani Bu Ali established a new •customs post at Aiqa. Their customs officer wrote to the State Customs Official at Sur, demanding refund of customs which the State had levied ■on the grounds that the boat belonged to the Bani Bu Ali. The Amirs refused to furnish the Council’s representatives with any explanation regarding this customs post. 88. About the same time the Bani Bu Ali stopped a boat belonging to the Arama section from entering the creek, whereupon the Arama prevented a Bani Bu Ali boat from entering the creek. The Bani Bu Ali then occupied Balad AsSur with a view to commanding the water supply of Sur and obtaining mastery over the town. On the 15th April they were attacked in Balad x\s Sur by about 70 men of the Arama and Fuwaris under the leadership of Sheikh Vaser al Majaala. The Arama lost six killed, whilst the Bani Bu Ali lost 10 killed and three wounded. Sheikh Rashid, Minister for Religious Affairs, accompanied by Saiyid Shahab, brother of His Highness, went to Sur on the 17th April to try and settle the dispute. Their reception by the Amirs was not cordial, and they returned to Muscat on the 23rd April, having failed to accomplish anything. However, through the intervention of other Sheikhs, the parties came to terms. The Arama and Makhana sections each destroyed one of their forts. All sections of the Jenebeh were to pay $20 on each of their boats to the Amirs for this year only, and Sheikhs Yaser and Naser bin Mubarak were to call on the Amirs at Aiqa. 89. On the 25th May the Amirs wrote to the Council of Ministers, stating that their action had been taken on behalf of the Muscat State and demanding payment of $10,000 expenses. They attempted to send this letter to the Council through the Political Agent, but it was returned to them and they were informed that if they wished to communicate with the Council they should do so direct. 90. In May Abdulla bin Saleh, Secretary to Mahomed bin Naser, proceeded to Bushire to interview the Political Resident. He asserted the Bani Bu Ali did not recognise the Sultan’s authority and attempted to get a certificate of identity at the Agency. He was directed to obtain a passport from the Sultan’s Government. 91. In July 1928 His Highness the Sultan and the Council of Ministers furnished their views on the situation at Sur. They resented the letters and actions of the Amirs of Jaalan, realised they were not strong enough to deal with the situation and asked for the assistance of the British Government. 92. In August 1928 the Amirs wrote to the Political Resident claiming that Sur was a part of their territory, that the Sultan’s Wall was there and customs collected with their permission, that the town and customs were under their protection and everything would be accomplished in its proper time. 93. On the 21st August a party of about 15 Arabs, chiefly of the Fuwaris section of the Jenebeh, boarded a Cutch Mandvi buggalow belonging to a British subject, Khimji Ramdas, which had arrived from Karachi, overawed the crew with rifles and daggers, and made off with 22 bags of rice and Rs. 200 worth of personal property belonging to the Nakhoda. Most of the culprits are known. The Council of Ministers arrested one of them in Muscat and are attempting to obtain the surrender of the others from the Fuwaris Sheikhs. 94. On the night of the 27th August some Arabs climbed over a broken wall and got into the fort where the Wali lives. They stabbed his two best16 horses. The Wahs Askans are believed to have had a hand in it in conjunction with the Bam Bn AH. They have been replaced bv others from Muscat. Ihe \\ ah s telephone hue from his residence to the customs is also being cut constantly. 94a. About this time a party of the Meshaikh tribe (a small tribe of Bedouins and robbers, originally allied to the Beni Bu liassan, but now stated to be under the protection cf the Bani Bu Ali) stationed themselves on the road outside Muqrimatain and looted all people coming into Sur for some clays, i hey killed a number of donkeys.

All tolls on trading vessels entering the Khor were then finally abolished. ,1 (Lorimeiy Vol. I, p. 515 ; also Narrative of Muscat Affairs.) 102. The latest news from Sur is that the caravan mentioned above left Q __ g ur f or Budiyah on the 29th September accompanied as far as Qalab Kay eh r Py an escort of Fuwaris and Wall’s askaris. Beyond Qalab Rayeh it was seized by a party of Bam Bu Ali, assisted by Ghialin and Makhana, and taken to Aiqa. the Wall sent a letter to the Amirs protesting against this,. 1 but they have refused to restore the caravan. VI.—Review of the Situation at Sur. 103. Hitherto the policy pursued with regard to the slave trade, arms* traffic and ill-treatment of British subjects at Sur may be summarised in the words of Major (now Sir) P. Z. Cox in his Report No. 37o, dated 29th August 1902 : — “ ft must be conceded that the present Sultan has been in a great measure powerless to do much to stop the ingress of newly captured negroes, and at any rate during the time that the question of the 1 rench Hag has been in process of negotiation between His Highness and the French Government it would have been ill-advised on om part to put upon him anv special pressure m this connection 5 but I. venture to submit that the recent purchase of a steamer for him and the fact that the question of the French flag seems to be shaping to a settlement, affords a convenient and fitting opportunity for the address to His Highness of a strong exhortation on the subject of Sur and its connection with the trade in arms and slaves and as to his own position in regard thereto.” 104. The purchase of a small patrol steamer in 1926 has proved no more effective as regards Sur than it did in 1902, whilst the total armed loice of the Muscat Infantry which could be made available for despatch to Sur is about 70 men. Such a force would be inadequate to meet a determined attack on the part of the tribesmen and could not look for reinforcement from Muscat. 105. Both the Sultan and the Council of Ministers realise that they are not strong enough to deal with the situation without the support and assistance of the British Government, and that unless they obtain such assistance the little control which the Muscat authorities exercise over Sur will cease. They have definitely asked for such assistance. The prestige of the Muscat Government rests at present on the support which they are able to obtain from the British Government. Without such support the State is impotent. If assistance were withheld the result would be far- reaching, as every part of the country would be affected. 106. A number of Arabs in Oman are of opinion that tile British Government are not anxious to see a strong rule established at Muscat and that they would countenance the formation of another independent authority in Jaalan. This, I have heard, is the opinion of the Amirs of Jaalan. Considered politically and in its bearings on the welfare of the Muscat State and the general peace of Oman, it seems most undesirable that any such claim should be countenanced. The Amirs could not maintain their independence, and the almost inevitable result of such a claim being allowed would tend to foster the intrigues for extraneous support which the Amirs are now active in fomenting. 107. Whether Mahomed bin Naser has the approval of Ibn Sand for hoisting his flag at Aiqa seems doubtful, but the extension of Ibn Sand’s influence to this part of the coast would seem to be undesirable.* i ' # In 1865 His Excellency the Governor of Bombay pointed out the evil effect of the revival of Wahabi power on the Indian Ocean with regard to piracy and slave trading, and that these aggressions threatened seriously to injure Muscat, a power which for several o-enerations past has been the only representative of civilisation and order in Eastern Arabia.. He proposed that aid be afforded to the Sultan to re-establish his authority in Sur or any other place on the seaboard of which his rebellious subjects or the Wahabis may have deprived him. (Minute dated 9oh October 1865.) 3393 C19 driven out, it would seem necessary to follow the same course as in the case of Muscat and Matrah. The towns have been transformed from armed camps living; constantly under the threat of raids, into peaceful and law abiding places as quiet and safe as any lovvn in India. The result has been reached bv gradual development of circumstances. Indian troops were landed m 1913, during the rebellion of Sheikh Isa bin Saleh and the Imam of Tanuf, for the protection of Muscat and Matrah in acpordance with our undertaking to defend these towms. After one attack in 1915, when he sustained a severe defeat, Sheikh Isa bin Saleh left these places severely alone. After the Sultan had come to terms wdth the Imam, a small levy corps under a .British officer was formed and paid for by the Muscat Government, and the Indian troops were able to depart. 117. This corps, though very weak numerically, is a constant reminder to the tribes that they cannot raid, the place with impunity and their presence is sufficient to restrain any lawless elements there may be in the population. 118. By stationing a battalion of Indian infantry at Sur for a year or two, the same result could presumably be achieved. The State could undertake to build a proper customs house and establish an effective administration there. Increased customs revenues could be utilised for the increase of the strength of the Muscat infantry by 100 men, eventually to take the place of the Indian troops as soon as the situation becomes sufficiently stabilised. 119. The cost of such a force has been worked out for me in detail by Captain Walker, Commandant, Muscat Ih fan try, but I-have not thought it necessary to include such details in this report. He estimates initial -expenditure, exclusive of quarters, at Rs. 2-1,170 ; annual expenditure for the first two years, Rs. 00,000 per annum ; annual expenditure subsequently^ Rs. 01,400 per annum. customs receipts of Sur amounted to— Rs. Rs. 1921 - 45,531 1925 - 42,751 1922 - 36,376- 1926 - 37,813 1923 - 50,728 1924 - 37,457 1927 - 38,802 The above amounts were collected under the conditions described above. If the town vmre properly under control the customs receipts should ■ exceed one lakh. 121. With the presence of such troops, it might also be possible to induce the British India Company to send their slov r mail steamers to call at bur. Although the volume of trade would justify this, the opposition of dhow owners and the general insecurity of the place prevents their doing so at present. Such visits would be a great civilising influence 1o the place in addition to furnishing an easy means of access and also fuitheung Butish T i*n rl 0 G. P. MURPHY, Major, Political Agent and H.B.M. Consul, Muscat. 9th October 1928. ■» « Vj 20 APPENDIX L Early History of Sur. The name Sur is stated by Colonel Miles to be identical with that of lyie 01 bur m the Mediterranean and to have been its prototype. He therefore ascribes a Phoenician origin to the place. The Mart of Maceta (mentioned by Arrian in his account of the voyao-e of Nearehus), Hereen says, was probably Sur, and he adds that an emporium like this, at the entrance of the Gulf, strengthens our idea f ‘ of an ancient Indian trade with the Oman coast. At the time of Albuquerque, Sur is described as a small fishing village he passed whilst approaching Muscat. The Portuguese appear to have occupied the place twice, the first period prior to 163d when they wele driven out by Naser bin Murshid al Yarraby, again prior to 1618 when fm-t °yP l h ° T dl ( ^?

In connection with my telegrams Nos. 1009 (Serial No. 4) andT.-]5 (Serial No. 10), dated the 16th and 23rd October 1928, I have the honour to invite a reference to my despatch No. 167-S., dated 20th April last (Serial No 1), on the subj-ct of the Amirs of Jaalan and the customs houses which they had set up in Sur. In this despatch I also reported that fighting had broken out at Sur. On the 7th May the Political Agent, Muscat, reported that peace had been made. 2. While at Muscat I requested Major Murphy to draw up a report on the whole Sur question and I attach herewith a copy of his despatch No. C.-71, dated 28th April 1928. I forward a copy of this excellent despatch in full for, though it is long, the details given are required to understand the present situation. 3. As stated in my despatch No. 167-S. (Serial No. 1), it was impossible to deal with the matter satisfactorily, except in the presence of the Sultan of Muscat, and my only effort has been to tide over the summer until his return. Thus on the arrival of an emissary from the Amirs of Jaalan in June, I informed him that the Resident would come to Stir this win ter to discuss and settle all differences and disputes, In the meantime I asked the Political Agent to obtain from the Council their opinion of the results of the action of the Amirs of Jaalan on the Muscat Government. It was difficult to get the Council to undertake this responsibility until ordered to do so by the Sultan, but the Political Agent was finally able to get a letter not only from the Council but from the Sultan also [vide Political Agents No. K.-28, dated 17th July 1928). 4. The outlines of the general situation are simple. The really import ant issues to us are certain statements in the letters of the Sultan and the Council. Sur has always been a difficult question for the Sultans of Muscat. It® turbulent tribes^have, however, always acknowledged Muscat sovereignty and by a balance of power and their enmity to the tribes of the interior the Sultan has always been able to draw upon one or the other of them to assist him on payment in time of trouble, and it was the Bani Bu Ali who, in 1895, came to Faisal bin Turki’s assistance when the town of Muscat was occupied by the tribes of the interior. Indeed it has been the Jenebeh, the enemies of the Bani Bu Ali, who have been in general opposed to the Sultan 5. The main points for note in the present situation arise out of the rivalry of these two tribes, the Bu Ali and the Jenebeh. The former are a single political entity acknowledging as their most important Shaikhs the Amirs of Jaalan; the latter are composed of four sections at Sur, namely, the Makhannah, Ghialin, Fuwaris and Aramah. The Makhannah and the Aramah, the two main sections, have had a blood feud since 1913. The Ghialin and the Fuwaris are comparatively unimportant, but the former have joined with the Makhannah and the latter with the Aramah. The Amirs of Jaalan in their bid for independence and the control of Sur and its hinterland have succeeded in winning over the Makhannah and the Ghialin. Thus the Aramah and the Fuwaris are isolated and the Jenebeh as a tribe fail to produce the balance of power which has hitherto made it possible for the Sultan’s weak Government to rule. 6. Sur is built on the two sides of an inlet of the sea with a channel to the ocean.2 iiitei'* The Bu Ali live on one side and the Jenebeh on the other, while the Sultan Wall’s fort is a few miles in the interior, where the water supnlv exists. J 7. The rival sections of the Jenebeh have built forts facing each other and this question has caused considerable fighting between the two parties of the same tribe, a matter which drew me to Sur a year ago. The joining of the Makhannah and the Ghialin with the Bu Ali will give the latter a footing on the Jenebeh side of the town apart from giving them a considerable preponderance in numbers. 8 In August 1927 Mr Thomas, the Wazir, went down to Sur His ofhdal objects were to recover a sum of 2| lakhs of rupe s due to Khan -bahadur JNasib, the naval coal contractor and an important merchant of Muscat, and to induce the tribes to demolish the forts, which were makino' for fighting and bloodshed. &amp; He came to the conclusion that the Aramah section ’were responsible for the opposition to a settlement and accordingly to punish them forfeited a dhow 0t ^section and proceeded to tow it away. The Aramah then opened fire T hiUi^it ^ G ° yernment shi P’ the “ A1 Saeed ’V though they did not succeed Bor this act against the Government they were fined rupees 10,000 a sum which the Muscat Government have been totally unable to recover ’ since thev have no force at their disposal. ^ 9. Thus the Aramah were up to this point the villains of the play. But with the new claim of the Amirs of Jaalan to independence and t° the control of Sur the Aramah, with their allies the Buwaris, are the onlv peisons in that place tvIio acknowledge Muscat sovereignty. At this point a parenthesis is required. Mr. Thomas, the Wazir of Muscat has always been desirous of keeping the Amirs of Jaalan friendlv to the Sultan since he considered that without the Amirs’support the Sultan could not control Sur Thus (as it would appear from subsequent events without the knowledge of the Sultan or the Council) he wrote a letter of which the Amir has produced a copy, asking him to assist in recovering’the finefrom the Aramah. The Amirs are using this letter as an excuse for having originally come into Sur. o u/ii 6 A: ^ rs daalan &gt; in reward for services to Saiyid Toorki Sultan of Muscat, were given m 1870 the personal right of freedom from customs dues. um They have used this purely personal right as an objection to bavin' a customs house of the Sultan s at Sur in the past, but they have now introduced their own customs office at Aiqah, which is on the Bu Ali side of the iulet of • T P' e c l lie sti°n then arises what action is the Muscat Government- going to take to establish their position. It may be noted that fhp Pnlif i Agent says that the utmost reinforcement the State can seud for Sur wmukl be about 70 men wTnle the tribes possess several thousands of men. o u ■ F ? 1 ’wi answ ^ r T ues tion I put, I ’would request a reference to fbo Sultan s letter and that of the Council on the result of the action of the Amirs of Jaalan if permitted to continue unchecked. e Amirs ., }?• ^ Council do not consider that the Amirs of Jaalan can control the W f0 f ^ th - e other tribes would rise against them and ultimate ly the country would pass into the hands of the Imam’s Government of Tho Interior, as other parts of Oman have done. government ol the afford T to dm 6ither eTent th6 MuSCat Stat6 WOuld lose which it cannot Their request is that &lt;c with the assistance of the British Government thev should proceed, by a man of war The h l request His Britannic Majesty’s Government to support them as thev used To support the Muscat Government and their Sultans” 7 d t0The Sultan is quite frank. He says : “ I now request His Br. tannic Majesty’s Government to afford us strong support in order to prevent the Shaikhs of Bani Bu Ali from any action which they intend to take at Sur district as they have no historical right to do so. The pressure which has been brought by the Bani Bu Ali on the Jenebeh is due to the fact that they think that we would not get any support from the Government. Tou are well aware that our Government had requested for help in connection with Sur affairs for a long time past and without the Government assistance they ivould not be able to prevent them and manage affairs concerning the customs administration. If the Jenebeh tribe even now get the least assistance from us they would never submit to Bani Bu Ali demands .... If our friend the Government will not attempt to assist my State in the affairs of Sur the result will he un satisfactory. Youjtre aware about the opinions of Shaikhs of other tribes in connection with the actions of this tribe, the weakness of our Government and lack of support from our friend His Britannic Majesty's Government.' Einally, the Political Agent reports : ‘^The loss of revenue from Sur and the possible deviation of trade from Muscat to Sur would be a heavy blow to Muscat revenues. The prestige of the Muscat State rests on the support, moral and physical, which they are able to obtain from the British Govern ment. Without such support the State is impotent. I am of opinion that unless the State receives some support to enable them to withstand the aggression of the Amirs, their authority will diminish, not only in Jaalan hut also in other parts of their territories.” 13. With Major Murphy’s views it is impossible to quarrel. The independent State of Muscat is in reality a fiction. It is an import ant and sterile government, dependent tor its existence in every inch of its territory upon the goodwill and support of the British Government. Were it not for this support it would not last for 24 hours but would fall into the hands of bigoted and backward tribes. 14. But Muscat and our position there is necessary to us and we shall thus have to give it the support required and repeat at Sur what we have pre viously done during the last 50 years. Fortunately the tribes are dependent upon the sea to release their output of dates and to bring them the rice they eat largely and the clothes they wear. Without the sea they would starve. Thus they can quickly be brought to subjection. 15. It has been an uphill task bringing the Muscat State into a financial condition of stability though that end is well within view, but a loss of revenue would revert it to bankruptcy. The tribes have no respect for it except in so far as the British Government creates that respect. 16. We must accordingly now tell the tribes that we have no desire to interfere with them but they must render unto Caesar that which is Caesar’s, and if they do not we shall have to apply to them our sea power and an economic blockade. But having done this we must consider the future. 17. The Government of India have, in their telegram No. 2084-S., dated 15th October 1928, expressed their views regarding Muscat. We can indeed continue our present policy, but would it not be better to sound French opinion and see whether we could not by agreement terminate the treaty of 1862 and make our relationship with Muscat a closer one in which we could be certain that we should not one day be left stranded politically and strategically after all we have done ? We annulled part of the same treaty with reference to Zanzibar and can annul the rest. The commercial treaties of America and Holland should not interfere with this action in any way. With the activity of Persia in the Gulf, an activity which may be dictated by B-ussia, it appears to me most undesirable that we should remain exposed to the whim of the Chief who rules. The present Sultan is, though weak and vain, friendly, but his weakness and vanity could be played upon.

By 1900 the influence of the Majaala section seems to have waned and Mahmad bin Mubarak of the Aramah section (not Makhannah section as stated erroneously in Lorimer’s Gazetteer, Vol. II, page 905) was the Temeemeb of the tribe. 8. Before his death last year Mansur bin Naser al Majaala of Masirah was the Temeemeh of the tribe but his influence over the Aramah section at Sur was negligible. Perhaps, for this reason, he entered into alliance with the Amirs of the Bani Bu Ali, supporting them in their bid for independence from the Sultan and obtaining their support for the Makhannah and Ghialin sections in their feud against the Aramah and Fuwaris. 9. Since his death, the Amirs of the Bani Bu Ali have been attempting to foist their nominee Shaikh Said bin Sultan bin Mahomad of Masirah on the Jenebeh. The same Shaikh whom they attempted, unsuccessfully, to foist on the tribe in 1925. The Aramah and Puwaris sections first supported Saeed bin Sultan bin Khamis al Majaala as the new Shaikh, but recently one Shaikh Yaser al Majaala has come into prominence and assumed the leadership. 10. The attitude of the various personalities involved has been consistent throughout. The situation is similar to, though more advanced than that reported by Major Hinde in his letter No. 1436, dated 4th October 1924. 11. It is clear from his own letters and actions that the Amir of the Bani Bu Ali, Mahomed bin Naser, is attempting to form an independent State for himself in Jaalan and is taking advantage of recent events (which he seems to have had a hand in engineering) in order to further this object. 12. These Amirs are by no means all powerful in Jaalan. Their action in attempting to seize control is likely to be resented by many tribes and there is every possibility of a general conflagration in that district. Such a possibility appears to be foreseen by Shaikh Isa bin Salih who in a letter to the Wali of Matrah dated 27th April 1928, asking about affairs at Sur, writes “ Pe haps it may draw to it what is quiet at present. 13. It will be seen from Major Hinde’s letter No. 1436, dated 4th Octo ber 1924, and Colonel Crosthwaite’s letter No. 18, dated 8th February 1926, that it was hoped the purchase of a steamer would increase the State’s control. In March 1926 Mr. Thomas wrote : “ The method of systematic land preven tion is not, I submit, conducive either to peace or to increase revenue. The paramount requirement for ‘ supporting customs ’ and the economic means, is a small patr 1 steamer. This was theory. In actual practice the “ Al Saeed ” although armed with two maxims and a P 7 gun has not imbued its Captain and crew with suflicient ardour to enable them to tackle a single dhow, or instilled sufficient awe in the tribes to prevent them firing on her. 14. The total armed force which the State could muster at present for despatch to Sur would be about 70 men. Such a force would be inadequate to meet a determined attack on the part of the tribesmen, and could not look for reinforcement from Muscat. I would be reluctant to advise the State to send it unless Government were prepared to support it with a man-of-war in case of need. 15. It is evident from their letter to me dated 21st April 1928, forwarded with my No. 68, dated 25th April 1928, that the Amirs are looking for support, or at least an attitude of toleration, from the British Government for their action at Sur, and it seems to me that if a firm attitude is taken and it is made clear to the Amirs that their assumption of independence and authority over Sur will not be tolerated, a more serious conflagration may be averted, I shall be glad of your instructions as to what attitude I am to adopt and what reply I am to give to the Amirs. 16. Should it be possible to send a man-of-war to take me to Sur, after receiving your instructions, the moral support of the presence of the man-of- war would, I think, be useful.6 Appendix I. Historical summary of the Bani Bu Ali. A branch of the great Adnani tribe, Bani Temeem, which is now reduced to a few widely scattered remnants. The Bani bu Ali may have immigrated from Bahrein where the Bani Temeem were formerly strong. (Colonel Miles and Imams, and Saiyids of Oman, p. 3b9). 2. During the Wahabi invasion of 1812-1813, Salim bin Ali, Tamimah Shaikh of the Bani bu Ali, who was hostile to the rule of the Imam Saiyid Said, became their supporter, helping them against the Bani bu Hassan. 'in consequence of the part which Salim bin Ali took against the Bani bu Hassan there was a feud between the two tribes which resulted in a fight wherein. Salim bin Ali and some of his people were killed; some of the Bani bu Hassan also fell and as neither side would give in the war between them continued, and has been carried on more or less constantly ever since. 3. Mahomed bin Ali, who succeeded Salim bin Ali, as Tamimah, seceded from the tenets of the Ibadiyah and adopted those of the Whhabi, throwing off the authority of the Imam. 4. In 1820, Saiyid Said having heard that Mahomed bin Ali had induced many of the inhabitants of Jaalan to adopt his creed, and that the people of Sharkiyyah had submitted to him, and that his followers among the el Ashkarah had plundered many English ships wrecked there, applied to '’the English to aid him in an expedition against Mahomed bin Ali and his confederates The Bani bu Ali murdered the messenger carrying a letter to the chiefs from the British party investigating reports of piracy ne ir Has el Had. Captain Thompson, m charge of operations, decided to avenge the act and with a small force, consisting of six companies, sailed to Muscat where plans were made for the Sultan to reinforce him at Sur. The combined force marched on Balad Bani bu Ali, the capital of the tribe, but proved entirely inadequate and after attempting to take the town were sharply ’ • Sl ^ ° Ut ° f e . i » ht . officers ^ud 270 men were killed. In JanuarV .» Major-General Sir Lionel Smith sailed with two brigades to restore British influence in the Gulf From Sur, they also marched to Balad Bani Lu Ah which surrendered after most of the defending force Lad been killed or captured. The Shaikh, Mahomed bin Ali, was deported to Bombay (Frontier and Overseas Expeditions from India, Volume VI). V 5. As late as 1845, the Bani bu Ali were strict if not fanatical in the observance cf the M ahabi principles. They have since relaxed something of eir rigour and have resumed the smoking of tobacco; but they continue to be exact m their observance of the forms and times of prayer and are account ed the most religious tribe in Oman Sultanate. They belong to the Wahabi sect known as .Agraqah (Lorimer, Volume II, page 66) „ -Ro m ear] ' P ar f of Saiyid Thoweynee’s regin the Bani bu Ali and the Barn bu Hassan were almost constantly engaged in petty skirmishes against each other in which Shaikh Abdullah bin Salim, the grandson of Mahomed bin Ah, at the. head of the Bani bu Ali generally won the day.

Shaikh Abdullah, however, managed to remain at liberty and thwart the Mutowwa power in every possible way. This led Saiyid Azzan to instigate the Bani bu Hassan and the A1 'Waheebeh to wage war ao-ainst the Bani bu Ali. A serious engagement took place at Lazzeh in which Abdullah defeated the two Hinav i tribes, and in revenge for which the Bani bu Hasan rose again only to be defeated a second time at Seh al Masaddee. 7 In 1*70 Saiyid Toorkee having requested the help of the Bani bu Ali they joined him at Sur and 200 of their number marchtd under Sheikh Abdullah and Yoosuf against Matrah where they both took a leading part in scaling the wall and in the engagement which resulted in the death of Saiyid Azzan bin Kais and subsequently restorinsr order and holding the place till Saiyid Toorkee’s arrival from Sur. In recognition of their services Saiyid Toorkee granted the Amirs of the Bani bu Ali exemption from the payment of Customs on the goods imported by them into Sur. 8. In 1895 the Bani bu Ali sent detachments in support of Saiyid Faisal when he was attacked at Muscat by Salih bin Aii but they made no deter mined effort to expel the rebels and recover the capital for their sovereign.. In recognition of their services Saiyid Faisal granted the Amirs of the Bani bu Ali an allowance of dollars 100 per mensem. 9. In the Spring of 1903, the ordinary annual hostilities between the Ghafiris and Hinawis of Shariqiyah being then in progress, Abdullah bin Salim found reason to suspect that the people of Sur, though Ghafiris, were supplying his enemies with the sinews of war. He accordingly marched down the coast and declared the harbour blockaded until his demands for satisfaction were complied with. After Abdullah had returned to the interior, relations between his supporters in the Aiqa quarter and his opponents in Muqraimatain became so strained, that when Major Cox arrived there in August, he found the two factions on the point of opening fire on each other across the intervening creek. The Political Agent, having obtained a truce for 48 hours, returned at once to Muscat and informed the Sultan, who immediately pro ceeded to the spot. The Jenebeh would not at once submit to his mediation, and, before proceedings had commenced in earnest, the Sultan was called away by serious news from Bustaq, nevertheless his visit actually averted fighting for the moment, and the dispute ’was adjusted, not long after, by neutral Sheikhs of the neighbourhood. (Lorimer, Yol. I, page 580.) 10. In 1913 Sheikh Abdullah bin Salim Al Alawi died. He was con sidered a very daring man, well disposed towards the Sultans of Muscat and always ready to help them. His eldest son Naser had predeceased him and as the latter’s son Mahomed was still a minor, Abdullah’s seeond.son Adi was made] Amir jointly with Mahomed bin IS'aser, an arrangement which still . continues. 11. During the 1913-19 rebellion the Bani bu Ali took the part of the Sultan, but, since the time Mahomed bin Naser started to assert his authority, relations between the Amirs and the Sultan have undergone a change. In 1920 the Wazir cut the allowances paid to the Bani bu Ali through misdirected economy but Mr. Wingate restored it. In 1923 the Amirs sent a petition to Government claiming that the port of Sur belonged to them and that the Sultan had nothing to do with the said Port ; that the Sultan did not supply them with arms and ammunition according to agreement; and asking that they might enter into direct relations with the Government of India. Govern ment replied that they were unable to intervene on their behalf. 12. In 1924 Mahomed bin Naser informed Major Hinde that he was authorized by the Muscat Government to settle all disputes in Sur and had succeeded in doing so wdth the exception of Khamis bin Mubarak of the Arama section. From the records of the Council of Ministers it appears that Mahomed bin Naser wrote to the Sultan in March 1924 offering to effect a settlement betw een the Jenebeh sections. The Sultan replied permitting him to intervene during the “ Salifah ” period, but after this period he was not to interfere in am thing. In 1925 Mahomed bin Naser also attempted to foist a Sheikh (Said bin Sultan bin Mahomed) on the Jenebeh at Sur. This action was resented and failed.8 13. In September 1924 Major Hinde visited Sur and reported. C£ I then enquired how it was I had received news that the Sheikh did not permit the new Customs House at Sur to be built. Mahomed bin JNaser became evasive and said nothin- had ever been sett ed about it final lv denying that he had ever agreed to its being built and that he never would agree. He went on to say that the right of His Highness to collect customs tribe” 1 '^ AiqahadlieYer beenreC ° gniZedbyhiS forebears himself and his r A 4 o 9 ,? 5 Col 1 onel Mheaux remarked that the Amirs were not verv ioyal to the Sultan and that if they had done their duty and -iven the 'w a H of Sur all the support he was entitled to there would have bee’n no question of paying a ransom for the release of a Hindu who was kidnapped by a Bedouin. ,. }P' ^ -h&gt; e J e mher 1925 in protesting a-ainst having obtain a &lt;e No OMpp- tion certificate from the Political Agent before being allowed to imnm-f ^ and ammunitini) from Bombay Mahomed bin Naser wrote to the Govemment'of fndia I Bubmit that this request of the Political Department of BomW i! not fair to me as a ruler of an independent state and it would be hishlv detri! mental to my dignity to ask for consent or certificate from the PohALAa M uscat.

In 1865 the Jenebeh of Sur who were diseontpnfprl cm rule, sought Wahabi assistence from Baraim and the* Wahabi agent 8 loth, sent a contingent who plundered Suq Sur assisted hv fhp b T Bani bu Ali. Nearly all the damage inflicted fell on Hindu Hade keepers of the place, who were British Indian subiects ■ Dm e^fAlr 0 ?' losses was estimated at dollars 27,700 and one of tlArA-Aif * * . of their another was wounded.

On the tribe attempt ing to procrastinate, a fire was opened which demolished their fort ; the whole of &amp; their boats were either confiscated or destroyed ; and a large quantity of their ship timber was burnt. No. personal injury was suffered by non- combatants who had ample opportunity to move, but a small part of the town was burnt accidentally, in consequence of a change in the direction of the w'ni. 4. In the month of June 1875 a godown belonging to the principal Indian trader at Stir, a hania named Jethanund Motamull, was broken into, during his absence on business at Muscat by a party of the Jenebeh tribe, who offered violence to the watchman in charge and carried off plunder to the value of about dollars 1,600. The spoil was openly sold in the town, and the robbers made no attempt at concealment of themselves, but no steps wnre taken by the Sheikhs of the tribe to cause restitution, and. it does not even appear that they offered to remonstrate with, or repress, their tribesmen. 5. There was no wall or other authority on behalf of the Sultan at Sur at the time, who could have taken action in the matter, and the bania therefore, on returning to Sur shortly after the outrage and discovering h\s loss, reported the matter to Colonel Miles and the case was referred to His Highness who promised redress. 6. Soon after this H M. S. “ Rifleman” happened to arrive at Sur, and the Sheikhs of the Jenebeh, apprehensive that her arrival was connected with the outrage committed by their tribesmen, and fearing the results, seized the offenders and would have doubtless caused restitution to be made to the trader hut H. M. S. “ Rifleman ** which only dropped anchor for a few hours inci dentally in passing, having in the meantime weighed and proceeded on her voyage, the Sheikhs perceived how matters stood and released their tribesmen without further question. 7. During His Highness Saiyid Turki’s absence at Guadar in 1875 the case was presented to His Highness Saiyid Abdul Aziz, but without any beneficial result. About this time, however, the Sheikhs of the tribe went to the bania and offered an arrangement promising to make good the loss in eight months. This arrangement they afterward repudiated, H. H. Saiyid Turki was on different occasions reminded of the matter after his return, but he was not able to put sufficient pressure on the tribe to cause them to make good the loss sustained at their hands, or to bring them to account for their misconduct, and they succeeded in procrastinating and delaying to feply to H. H. until the season opened and they could get away in their bughlahs. 8. H. H. finally informed Colonel Miles that he left the matter in the hands of Government and as the latter considered the continued failure of the Jenebeh tribe to cause restitution to a British subject plundered by them injurious to British interests, he supported H. H.’s request that the enforce ment &lt; f reparations might be undertaken by Government. To have held H. H. personally responsible for the loss sustained at the Jenebeh’s hands would have tended still further to weaken H. H.’s authority and would have encouraged the predatory Arabs to continue their depredations on British subjects'at H. H.’s expense ; while the exaction of reparation from this tribe would on the other hand, be a cautionary warning to all. ^ Colonel W. H Prideaux the Political Resident, also suggested that besides the original amount a fine of dollars 2,000 should be levied on the Jenebeh, partly as com pensation for the delay m settling (it was then Octobei 1876) and paitly as ca penalty for the offence committed against a British subject. 9. At first, however, the Government of India would not comply with the Sultan’s request, claiming that the repression of crime and the punishment of criminals in the dominion of Mnskat was the duty of the Sultan » and that in return for the responsibility which it has incurred in guaranteeing to Saiyid Turki the payment of the Zanzibar subsidy, and for other material aid which had been afforded to H. H. from time to time, the Government of India might fairly expect that the punishment of offenders in Oman would beeffectually carried out, in so far at least as offences against British subjects were concerned, without requisitions being made on the British Government for armed intervention. 10. The Sultan’s efforts to comply with this attitude of Government were so feeble and ineffective that finally in July 1877, the Political Agent was authorized by Government to proceed to Sur in H. M. S. “ Teazer ” and convey the Sultan’s demands. When the Political Agent arrived at Sur on the 24th July, he wrote to the Jenebeh enclosing H. H.’s order, and warned them that if they failed to comply to it within 24 hours, measures of a coercive nature would follow. The Jenebeh had no recognized head at the time, the nominal Shaikh being a boy as yet without authority, but several of the leading men came on board in reply to the letter. They expressed their readi ness to comply with H. H.’s order, but explained that the absence of a recog nized authority amongst them rendered it necessary for each member of the tribe to pay his share at once, as, were some to pav on behalf of the rest, their chance of re-imbursement. would be small. On this ground, and on the Ground that several of their principal men were inland fighting with the Bani bu Hassan, they asked for an extension of time, and were allowed until sunset on the 25th. 11. By noon of the 25th Jethanund’s claim, amounting to dollars 1,600, had been satisfied, partly by a money payment, and partly by a buo-hlah of which he had received possession. At sunset the Governor of Soor and Jethanund came on board. The former delivered to the Political Ao&gt;ent dollars 2,000. and the latter stated that his claim against the Jenebeh^had been fully satisfied. 12 Government expressed satisfaction with the results obtained and directed that tne fine of dollars 2,000 should be paid to Saiyid Turki after deductions of the expenses incurred in the measures which had’been IH K.C/H • 13. la 1898, the Jenebeh were making representations to the Sultan with a view to obtaining the recall of Suleiman bin Suwevlim’s son who was iictmg as his father s representative in the Governorship * of Soor. As the Sultan had declined to acquiesce in the demands of the Jenebeh and* as in consequence of His Highness’ attitude the situation had become critical the Pohtieal Agent Maskat, submitted to the Political Resident the following oner history of the occurrences w^hich led to the crisis. ,, .Af- °, n the 21st March, Suleiman arrived at Soor from Dhofar and on t ie 26th he summoned the Sheikhs of the Jenebeh and informed them that m future he would not respect Khafir and would seize the persons and pro- pert} of those who belonged to tribes whom he considered unfriendly I would here explain that the “ Khafir ” system of protection amounts to this that when a parly or a caravan wish to pass through the country of another n-ibe and take with them as escort a man belonging to the tribe through whose country they wish to pass, that party or caravan is safe from attack and is so to speak sacred till it returns to its own country. 15. The “ Khafir ’’ is respected to such an extent that members of a tribe tiavellmg under this protection through the country of a tribe with which they even have a blood feud, are safe. V 16 M rl ien the Jenebeh heard of Suleiman bin Suweylum’s intention to disregard this firmly established custom of the tribes of Oman, they asked the latter whether he real y meant to imply that he would not respect the person and property of a tribesman coming into Soor under the protection of a membei of then tube, to which Suleiman replied that he would seize such a man even m the house of the “ Khafir ” himself. This answer, it is needless to say, aroused the greatest indignation among the Jenebeh. On the same day ' U l l ln ‘' m ef * ®°° r anfl proceeded to Maskat leaving his son, a lad of 12 or 13 years of age in charge of the Governorship of the place and on the 6th April ouleiman wrote (presumably with the consent of the Sultan) to his son at Soor and ordered him to build a fort at a spot whicl, would at once command both the water supply of the town and the caravan route to the interior. On thei Ofli rf fhft same month Suleiman’s son threatened to shoot a gardener and actually did shoot a bullock and cut down a date tree belonging to him because the latter refused to supply him with some green grass, which he was keeping for his own camels. ^ 17 This and other arbitrary and highhanded acts on the part of Sulei- ma.ti’s 'son resulted in a combination between the torn fakhmh or sections of the Jenebeh, the Sheikhs of which sent a letter to the Sultan on the 17ih Anril requesting him to issue orders to stop the building of the fort and to remoT SuHman’s son from his post at Soor. His Highness did not vouchsafe a replv to this letter and the building of the fort continued. Then, is no doubt that the possession of a fort, so advantageously situated as the one n question would have enabled the Sultan to overawe the Jenebeh and to ensure a large increase in the revenue derived from the customs at Sooi, the navment of thich is at present evaded. The Jenebeh were quite aware of this and on the 26th April they asain wrote to the Sultan on the subject and aga received no reply 1 On the 4th May Sheikh Musallan bin Abdullah with four other Jenebeh Sheikhs came to Muscat and placed their comp am s before the Sultan, but His Highness turned a deaf ear to their representations and the Sheikhs returned disappointed to Soor. 18 The Jeneheh, seeing that the Sultan was un likely to accede to their demands now proceeded to secure the goodwill and promises of co-operation ffZthe Hisbra and the Bani Rashid tribes through whose country it would be necessary for any expedition sent by land from Maskat against them to°nass but tliei^Sheikhs^till continued to send letters to the Sultan on the suWect of their grievances and His Highness’ well-wishers residing m 1 10 neighbourhood of Soor also wrote and advised him strongly to listen to the representations of this tribe. &gt; a A 19 At length the Sultan acting on the advice of his brother Seyyed Muhammad bin Toorkee and others, sent his head writer Hamed to Soor with instructions to hear what the Jenebeh had to state and to assure them that His Highness would be prepared to listen to any specific charges t ey mig make against Suleiman’s son Hamed was also instructed to direct the. latter to stop the bn ilding of the fort. No attention was however paid by Suleiman s on to this order aSd the building of the fort continued In the meanwhile Suleiman who was now in Burka, and had received the news of Hamed s mission to Soor, wrote a letter to the Sultan. The concents of this letter have not transpired but there is no doubt that, it had its influence on the Sultan, when Hamed returned, His Highness did not even trouble to hear his report of the result of bis interview with Sheikhs of the malcontent tribe. 20. Matters were now beginning to assume a serious aspect and Shei &lt; Abdullah bin Salim, the “ Temeemeh or head Sheikh of the Bam bu A , tribe residing close to Soor, who had rendered great assistance to the Su an during the rebellion of 1895, now came to Muscat with a ^mw ° f influencing His Highness to adopt a conciliatory attitude towurds the Jenebeh but filing that the Sultan was on tour in Semail he wrote him a letter pointing out that an the disturbances which had of late “purred in Oman were the result of Suleiman’s policy of unnecessary interference in the affairs of the tubes and warnin'* His Highness that a continuance of his present policy towaids the Jenebeh would only result in his losing the little control he possessed over that tribe Sheikh Abdullah gave the Sultan clearly to understand that His Xmess need expect no assistance from the Bani Bu Ali tribe m the event of his deciding to adopt coercive measures rgainst the Jenebeh. 21 This communication resulted in one concession being granted an Sheikh’Abdullah returned to Soor the bearer of peremptory orders to Suleiman s son to discontinue work on the fort. But the Jenebeh were noUo be pacified in so easy a manner. They knew that before long Suleiman or his son would set aside the Sultan’s order and would recommence the building of the to.t. They therefore informed Abdullah that nothing less than the recall ot Suleiman’s son would satisfy them. Abdullah communicated tbe failu,e^of his negotiations to the Sultan and at the same time once more strongly ui^ed upon His Highness the desirability of conforming to the wishes of the JtuebJt Unless he desired a repetition of the Dhofar incident.13 mmmM to him he eron s »I4 * to eon. * said eti- em. of ifie re ad 'ft n : 3 i i if) le i ni $• or seemed to stril^Q S;ilcli l)in ycis^or tlint some 1 snornliors of his trib© itgig in ths fort. The Sheikh thereupon advanced up to the walls under a flag of truce and* called upon the garrison to surran ier A parley then ensued ,a?id an agreement was arrived at, Saleh bin Yasser guaranteeing that the Wal’.s son and the beleaguered garrison would he escorted in safety to the c &gt; st and placed on board a vessel hound for Maskafc. The fort was accordingly evacuated and the party embarked and arrived at Muscat on the 7 rh. 27 Before returning f o their homes the rebels destroyed the new and half built ort referred to above. The Sheikhs wrote to the Sultan oiTering to hand over the f at to any one deputed by His Highness to take it over except Suleiman b n Suvveylim and his son and the Sultan despatched a fresh garrison of 25 men under Hamad bin Saif A1 Amri. The Sultan wrote a con ciliatory letter to the Sheikhs informing them that he pardoned them for their late act of rebellion but it was generally believed that His Highness had only done this to put the Jenebeh off their guard and to attack them when they were unprepared for resistance. 23. O i the llthf October Sheikh Abdullah bin Amir, the head Sheikh of the Beni Kahsib, called on the Political Agent and stated that he had been deputed by the Jeuebeh to ascertain from him whether the British Govern ment had any intention of interfering in the quarrel between the tribe and the Sultan. He added that the Jenebeh felt quite able to hold their own against any attack that could be made against them by His Highness by land, but being* a maritime tribe they knew that they would be powerless to resist the Saltan if the latter were aide ) by our ships, as in the case of Dhofar. The Political Agent replied that he was not in a position tie give them any positive assurances on this point but that speaking generally h6 should say that any such inference wouhl be very unlikely so long as British interests were un assailed and British subjects remained unmolested. 29. On the 20th October the garrison under Hamad bin Seif A1 Amri which were despatched to take over the fort at Soor from the Jenebeh returned toMaskat and on the following day Sheikh Rashid bin Muhammad, a wealthy Arab merchant of Jissa, who had also been sent to Soor to endeavour to con ciliate the Jenebeh arrived with a letter to the Saltan from Saeed bin Naser, the head Sheikh of the tribe in which the latter while thanking His Highness for the free pardon granted to the tribe informed him at the same time that His Highness’ garrison could not be allowed to take possession of the fort uqtil the Jenebeh were first as sured under the guarantee of theBritish Government that no atlempt would in future be made to re-appoint Suleiman bin Suweylim as Governor of Soor. 30. Sheikh Rashid further informed the Sultan that the young bloods of the rebel tribe were in favour of destroying the Sultan’s fort and assuming an attitude of defiance against His Highness’ authority, hut that they were overruled by the elders who sent the letter of which he was the hearer. 31. On the same day the Sultan received a communication from the custom’s farmer stating that the Jenebeh Sheikhs had directed him to withhold payment of the customs receipts from the Sultan with the exception of the amount collected as punitive tax for compensation of British subjects for losses during the late rebellion. 32. Two Sheikhs of the Jenebeh who flew French flags on their dhow and were therefore under French protection arrived at Muscat on the 21st with Rashid bin Muhammad. They both paid visits to Mons. Ottawi but not to the Sultan. The object of their visit to Muscat was not known but it was believed that they had come to purchase arms and ammunition and to watch events. 33. Saiyid Muhammad bin Hamad, accompanied by a garrison of 60 men, took possession of the fort at Soor on the 2oth Isovember. The fort was found to have been entirely dismantled, all the wood work having been carried away and nothing left but the bare walls. The Sultan sent 20 barrels of gunpowder and 4,000 ball cartridges for the use of the garrison at S66r and ordered the wall to place the fort in repair.U. During this period, the authority of the SuUan at Sur was being iurther u» dermined as a result of French intrigue. A plan of the harbour at bur, published by the French Government in 1901 showed th.-it their atten tion had been directed to that place at some earlier date and in 1893 M. Chapui a somewhat disreputable French subject arrived at Sur in a steamer flying the Freneh flag and tried, hut without success to obtain a site for a coal shed there. Ihe scheme for advancing French interes s by a wide distribution of the French flag was now bo'dly pursued.

Meeting an armed slave of the murdered sheikh on the outskirts of Sur he decided the man had been detailed to kill him and tired and killed the slave. This started indiscriminate firing between the sections in which an il rama boy was killed. The Fuwaris then took a hand and seized a water donkey belonging to the Arama and a struggle ensued in which an Arama girl was killed. The Wall was able to use the Ramzan fast for arrang ing a 45 days armistice. 41. About this time (1924) Mahomed bin Naser, Amir of the Bani bu Ali started to take an interest in the affairs of the Jeneheh, having formed an alliance with Mansur bin Naser Jenebeh Sheikh of Masirah, and won over the Makhanah and A1 Ghialin sections in Sur—the weaker party in the feud among the Jenebeh—to acknowledge his authority. 42. In 1925, Sheikh Mansur bin Naser went to Sur, informed the Hindu community that there was no Sultan’s Government in Sur and that they were to look to him for justice. He tried to form a committee of leading men for the administration of justice as the local wa’i had been found incapable. The Wali told the Hindus that he was powerless and that they should inform the British Government. 43 In 1927 Sheikh Mansur bin Naser of Masirah (mentioned above) accompanied by Hamdan bin Naser and Salim bin Naser, brother of Mahomed bin Naser of the Bani hi Ali stayed at Mecca for three months as the guests of His Majesty Ibn Saud. Mansur bin Naser die t of small pox on the return journey. APPENDIX III. Summary op recent events in Sur. In 1927, the Arama and Makhana sections of the Jenebeh each built three new forts in their quarters against the orders of the Wali. 2. In August 1927, Mr. Thomas, Minsiter of Finance went to Sur. As it transpires afterwards, one of his objects was to arrange for a journey which he proposed making overland from Sur to Dhofar lor which he required the assistance of the Bani bu Ali. He attempted to induce the Jenebeh to pay 2^ lakhs of rupees which they owe Khan Bahadur Nasib and Ali Musa Khan, merchants of Muscat, and tried to induce them to pull down the forts which they had built. It appeared to Mr. Thomas that the opposition to this came mainly from the Arama section and on leaving Sur, in the A1 Saeed, he took in tow an Arama sambuk lying in the harbour, whereupon the A1 Saeed was fired on by the Arama section. 3. The Council of Ministers fined the Arama section Rs. 10,000 and ordered the destruction of their three forts but they have not been able to enforce this and have been looking to the British Government to assist them in doing so. 1928. 4. On the 10th April, the Council of Ministers received information that the Amirs of the Bani bu Ali had established a customs port at Aiqa. Their customs officer wrote to the state customs official at Sur demanding refund of customs which the state had levied on a boat which they said belong to the Bani bu Ali. 5. The Amirs refused to furnish any explanation regarding the customs post to Saiyid Shahab, brother of His Highness and Sheikh Rashid, Minister of Shara who had gone to Sur to investigate the recent trouble there. 6. The Amirs are stated to have stopped a boat of the Arama section from entering the creek whereupon Sheikh Yaser al Majaala, who has only recently come to prominence as Sheikh of the Jenebeh, prevented a Bani bu Ali boat from entering the creek. 7. The Bani bu Ali then occupied Balad as Sur, possibly with a view to commanding the water supply of Sur. On 15th April they were attacked in Balad at Sur by about 79 men of the Arama and Fuvwris under the' leadershipANNEXUKE I. Translation of a letter dated 27th TUI Eejjeh 1346 {16th June 1928) No. 64, from the Council of Ministers to the Sultan of Muscat, to Mr. G. Gazder, representative of the Tolitical Agent, Muscat, in his absence. After Complements. We have the pleasure to reply to your letter No. C.-97, dated the 13th June 1928, in which you asked us, in accordauce with the instructions of the Political Agent, to inform you of the opinion of the Council in respect of the letter of the Beni Bu Ali Shaikhs of Ja’alan and their deeds. Indeed we understand from their letter that they demand 10,000 riyals to meet the expenses of their halting at Sur to fight the Irama. Decision of the Council is as under :— 1. The Council does not accept this proposal and demand as it has no precedence. 2. After their arrival at Sur, as soon as we received reports of their deeds, we sent some Deputies in order to enquire from them about this action and inform them that the Council does not wish that any measure be taken now at Sur, hut they did not listen to the orders of the Council and persisted in their intentions. They even said that if the Government do not agree to their occupation their demands should be granted. Finally Sayid Shahab and Shaikh Bashid asked them to stop hostilities for two days m order to refer the matter to the Council but without result. 3 When they (Deputies) saw their persistence in their demand they discussed the question of the Customs which they had established at Aiqa but they did not give any answer and made a truce between themselves without reference to the Government. Keeping their objects in view they are making preparation to attain their ends and the Government of Muscat has not taken any action in the matter up to now. We have received a letter dated the 14th Dhil Hejjeh 1346 from Shaikh Isa bin Salih at Harithi in which he says “ If you neglected the matter 1 should not be blamed (for any action which may be taken by me). &gt; bur is a port of call for us and our tribesmen. You should help us against those who have been aggressive and rebelled against their masters. Negligence is not advisable in every affair.” The Council has therefore arrived at the decision that if the Government do not take any measure to check the move ments of Beni Bu Ali, the result will be very had as the Omanis who do not like the suzerainty of Beni Bu Ali at Sur may take advantage of this opportunity to make interference at Sur. After one week we will depute Sayid Shahab bin Faisal as Wali for Sur. Usual ending. ANNEXUB II. Translation of a letter from the Council of Ministers to H. H. the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Muscat, to the Political Agent and H. B. M’s. Consul, Muscat, No. 71/61, dated the 29th June 1928. After Compliments. We trust that you are in perfect health. Captain Walker attended the Majlis yesterday and stated that you had „ked him to enquire from the Council of Ministers about the state of affairs at Sur anti about the sons of Abdullah bin Salim al Hamuda, Ainirs of Beni Bu All the situation of Sur and its importance to the Government of Muscat, the recent events which took place there and continues up to now, the objects of the sons of Hamuda and their intentions at Sur, the effect of then inter- ference and actions, views of the Majlis as to what measure should he taken for checking the said individuals and what support the Government of MuscatAs to the political point of view, Sur is a centre for all affairs concerning the Eastern parts as has already been stated by ns. The Muscat Government can exercise their authority over those parts and their people who are great in number as long as Sur is under their control, and do not wish to cease their relations with them. II. The said tribes themselves do not agree to any other authority at Sur besides the Muscat Government especially the Oman tribes who will rot hesitate to seize the opportunity of stepping into Sur if the Government neglected it and therefore the Muskat Government are obliged to take steps to keep off the Shaikhs of Beni Bu Ali from Sur. III. From the financial point of view there is no doubt that losses would be incurred if the condition is changed at Sur and particularly if another Customs House besides the Government’s would be established there. If a Customs House besides that of Muskat Government be-established near Sur the boats will visit that Customs without the information of the Government and thus they will find an open way for dealing in the prohibited trade which the Government of Muscat has undertaken to suppress it. The Arabs as it is their habit were endeavouring to find a means to do so It should be known that the sons of Hamudah are Shaikhs at Ja’alan and Chiefs of their own tribe Beni Bu Ali only. They have no right to exercise any control, over Sur and if the Government of Muskat withdraw their authority the tribes of Jaalan and the Eastern parts of Oman who are stronger than them (Beni Bu All) will rise against them. The Council of Ministers are of opinion that by the assistance of the British Government they should proceed by a Man-of-war to Sur where they .would discuss matters with the subjects and effect a settlement in the disputes between them in any way that the Government deem advisable and if some of them do not agree to the adjudications of the Government they should be punished. Then the sons of al Hamudah should be warned to refrain from interfering with the affairs of the subjects of Sur, to abolish the Customs House which they had established at Aiqa, to pull down the building which they had erected at the entrance of the creek as there was no such building before and its existence will cause a loss to the Muscat Government and the subjects and by means of that building they can prevent boats from entering the crtek or going out of it and take taxes from them. These are the views of the Majlis with regard to Sur affairs and the con dition is as has been explained by us. The Muscat Government request H. B. M.’s Government to support them as they used to support the Muscat Government and their Sultans. ANNEX III. Translation of letter dated Bombay, 18th Muharram 1347 {6th July 1928), from U. U. Sayid Taimur bin Faisal, Sultan of Muscat, to Major G. P. Murphy, Political Agent and PL. B. Mjs Consul, Muscat. After compliments. I have to inform you by this letter to confirm our personal con versation regarding Sur affairs and the interference of the Shaikhs of Beni Bu Ali. I hope you will kindly submit this information to our friend the Government and draw their attention with a view to favour us with com plete assistance to prevent the said people from their action and to do away with any establishment that they have made at Sur and Janabah which they have no right to do. I have received a’letter from the Council of Ministers of my State dated 19th Dhil Qadeh 1346 (8th June 1928) describing the trouble which has been created by the Shaikhs of Beni Bu Ali in fighting with the. Janabah, subjects of Sur, without any order from me or the Council of Ministers. They have also prevented the Janabah’s boats from entering the creek and have destroyed20 20 their properties which were lying near the State fort where the Wali resides. They have levied a tax on vessels which enter the creek and have established a Customs House at Aiqa. All these actions are against us and disturb our State’s administration, item Bu Ali have no right to interfere m Sur affairs without our permission or from our representative at that place. As you know Beni Bu Ali are subjecfs of Muscat as other tribes are and whenever their assistance is required in any matter they have to execute our order at Sur or other countries. I now request H. B. M.’s Government to afford us strong support in order to prevent the Shaikhs of Beni Bu Ali from any action which they intend to take at Sur district as they have no historical right to do so. The pressure which has been brought by Beni Bu Ali on the anabah is due to the fact that they think that we would not get any support Horn the Government. You are well aware that our Government had request ed lor help m connection with Sur affairs since a long time and without the overnment assistance they -would not be able to prevent them and manage affairs concerning the Customs administration, etc. If the Janabah tribe even now get the least assistance from us they would never submit to Beni Bu Ali’s demands. The Council of Ministers forwarded to me the letter which they had received from the Shaikh of Beni Bu Ali demanding payment of expense* which they had spent during their fighting with the Janabah as they considered fn?e rt 61r last * ctl0 , n , was b y order ° f our Government. If their statement was true they would not have opposed the Deputies of my Government Ministers unng their last agressions at Sur. Under these circumstances we will never accept their demand because we did not order them at all, and if they had been ordered by my Government to rise against the Janabah there would* have been a representative on our behalf with them. „ .

In reality the Council of Ministers used to send reports to me since the beginning of the trouble asking for ade- hnite answer but I did not send any as I considered that they had been fullv authorised by me to take action in important affairs. They have undoubted v explained the whole facts to you.

Tn connection with my telegrams Nos. 1009 (Serial No. 4) andT.-]5 f Serial No 10) dated the 16th and 23rd October 1928, I have the honour to Invite a reference to my despatch No. 167-S., dated 20th Apn last (Serial No 1), on the subj&lt; ct of the Amirs of Jaalan and the customs houses ^hich they had set up in Sur. In this despatch I also reported that fighting hid broken out at bur. On the 7th May the Political Agent, Muscat, reported that peace had been made. 2. While at Muscat I requested Major Murphy to draw up a repor on the whole Sur question and I attach herewith a copy of his despatch No C.-71, dated 28th April 1928. I forward a copy of this excellent despatch m Ml f . though it is long, the details given are required to understand the present 3. As stated in my despatch No. 167-S.

The outlines of the general situation are simple The really WPM ant issues to us are certain statements m the letters of the Sultan and the Sur has always been a difficult question for the Sultans of Muscat. Its turbulent tribes^Ire, however, always acknowledged Muscat snyereipityRnd by a balance of power and their enmity to the tribes on has always been able to draw upon one or the other ol * h ,T,n -1895 came to mvment in time of trouble, and it was the Bam Bu All vno, m 18^5, came to El Hn Turki’s assistance when the town of Muscat was occupied by he tribes of the interior. Indeedit has been the Jenebeh, the enemies Bani Bu Ali, w^ho have been in general opposed to the bultan 5. The main points for note in the present situation arise out of the rivalry of these two tribes, the Bu Ali and the Jenebeh. . . The former are a single political entity acknowledging as their mos important Shaikhs the Amirs of Jaalan; the latter are composed of four sections at Sur, namely, the Makhannab, Ghialm, Puwans and Aramah. The Makhannah and the Aramah, the two mam sections, have had a blood SmC&lt; The Ghialin and the Fuwaris are comparatively unimportant, hut the former have joined with the Makhannah and the latter with the Aiam • The Amirs of Jaalan in their bid for independence and the control of Sur and its hinterland have succeeded in winning 0V V * tbrjeMbeh as a PVtinlin Tims the Aramah and the Buwaiis are isolated anc tribe^fail to produce the balance of poiver which has hitherto made it possible for the Sultan’s weak Government to rule. 6. Sur is built on the two sides of an inlet of the sea with a channel to the ocean.(The italics are mine.) Tbe Sultan is quite frank. He says : “ I now request His Br'.tannic Majesty’s Government to afford us strong support in order to prevent the Shaikhs of Bani Bu Ali from any action which they intend to take at Sur district as they have no historical right to do so. The pressure which has been brought by the Bani Bu Ali on the Jenebeh is due to the fact that they think that we would not get any support from the Government. Ton are well aware that our Government had requested for help in connection with Snr affairs for a long time past and without the Government assistance they would not be able to prevent them and manage affairs concerning the customs administration. If the Jenebeh tribe even now get the least assistance from us they would never submit to Bani Bu Ali demands .... If our friend the Government will not attempt to assist my State in the affairs of Sur the result will he un satisfactory. You^are aware about the opinions of Shaikhs of other tribes in connection with the actions of this tribe, the weakness oj our Government and lack of support from our friend Sis Sritannic Majesty's Government.' Finally, the Political Agent reports : “„The loss of revenue from Sur and the possible deviation of trade from Muscat to Sur would be a heavy blow to Muscat revenues. The prestige of the Muscat State rests on the support, moral and physical, which they are able to obtain from the British Govern ment. Without such support the State is impotent. I am of opinion that unless the State receives some support to enable them to withstand the aggression of the Amirs, their authority will diminish^ not only in Jaalan but also in other parts of their territories.” 13. With Major Murphy’s views it is impossible to quarrel. The independent State of Muscat is in reality a fiction. It is an import ant and sterile government, dependent tor its existence in every inch of its territory upon the goodwill and support of the British Government. Were it not for this support it would not last for 24 hours but would fall into the hands of bigoted and backward tribes. 14. But Muscat and our position there is necessary to us and we shall thus have to give it the support required and repeat at Sur what we have pre viously done during the last 50 years. Fortunately the tribes are dependent upon the sea to release their output of dates and to bring them the rice they eat largely and the clothes they wear. Without the sea they would starve. Thus they can quickly be brought to subjection. 15. It has been an uphill task bringing the Muscat State into a financial condition of stability though that end is well within view, but a loss of revenue would revert it to bankruptcy. The tribes have no respect for it except in so far as the British Government creates that respect. 16. We must accordingly now tell the tribes that we have no desire to interfere with them but they must render unto Caesar that which is Caesar’s, and if they do not we shall have to apply to them our sea power and an economic blockade. But having done this we must consider the future. 17. The Government of India have, in their telegram No. 2084-S., dated 15th October 1928, expressed their views regarding Muscat. We can indeed continue our present policy, but would it not be better to sound French opinion and see whether w r e could not by agreement terminate the treaty of 1862 and make our relationship with Muscat a closer oae in which we could be certain that we should not one day be left stranded politically and strategically after all we have done ? We annulled part of the same treaty with reference to Zanzibar and can annul the rest. The commercial treaties of America and Holland should not interfere with this action in any way. With the activity of Persia in the Gulf, an activity which may be dictated by Bussia, it appears to me most undesirable that we should remain exposed to the whim of the Chief who rules. The present Sultan is, though weak and vain, friendly, but his weakness and vanity could be played upon.4 His father became very difficult at one time and definitely opposed to the British, It is undesirable to risk this occurring again with the unpleasant political position which would arise. Now that the Sultan is dependent upon us for the breath he breathes it is&gt; I would suggest, the time to recommend to him and his Council (who would make r o difficulty) that our responsibilities in Muscat are so great that he must ask for a position within the Empire for us to continue our assistance. A copy of this letter is being sent to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India and another is being given to Sir Denys Bray at Bushire. Enclo. 1 to Serial No. 34. Confidential letter from the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Muscat, to the Secretary to the Hon’ble the. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, No. C.-71 DATED THE 28TH APRIL 1928. I have the honour to forward herewith, for the information of the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and for such action as he may deem necessary, the following report on the present situation at Sur. 2. In order to make the position there clear, I have deemed it necessary to include in the report short historical summaries of the two tribes involved which I have compiled from the files and records in the Consulate. These have been included in the form of appendices. Appendix I.—Historical Summary of the Bani Bu Ali. Appendix II.—Historical Summary of the Jenebeh. Appendix III.—Short Summary of recent events. 3. Sur, the second largest town in Oman, owes its importance largely to its being the nearest dhow harbour to India in Arabia. It has been for a con siderable period the chief distribuiing centre for the slave trade. Dhows ply regularly from Sur to Bombay and Karachi, Socotra, Aden, Zanzibar, and the African coast; also up the Persian Gulf and to the Mekran coast! There is quite a considerable trade with India and a small colonv of Indian traders have been resident there for many years. 4. The town is situated on both sides of the entrance of a creek. The quarter on the east is called Aiqa and is occupied by the Bani Bu Ali tribe. That on the west is called Miqraimatciin and is occupied by the Jenebeh Behind the town about two miles from the sea is a ridge and on the plain behind the ridge is Balad As Sur, a stone built village where the Wall resides. Part of it is known as Suq Sur, A large part of the water supply of Sur is obtained from Balad As Sur, and it was in order to keep the town in check by commanding the water supply that this site was determined on for the Wali’s residence 5 5. In 1901, in order to facilitate the collection of dues at Sur, the Sultan erected a line of block-houses between Sur and Balad As Sur. In connection with the above block-houses 100 extra sepoys were engaged, but this garrison does not appear to have been kept up, 6. Both the Bani Bu Ali and Jenebeh tribes who inhabit Sur have been somewhat unruly subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, but in recent vears there has been one fundamental difference between them. Whilst the Bani Bu Ali appear to be united under their Amirs, the Jenebeh are divided amongst themselves by a Hood feud which started about 1913 and has been tent un more or less ever since. 1 1 7. In former years the Jenebeh were united under a Temeemeh ShiiH, chosen from the Majaala section who lived at Nezwa and Masirah. In the time of Colonel Miles the Temeemeh was Nasir bin Khamees who was regard ed wtth veneration and had despotic power. He resided near Nezwa and tookIramah Scttn (act Makhaonah section as stated erroneously m Lortmer s Gazetteer^ Vdl.

Should it be possible to send a man-of-war to take me ’ mail . 0 f receiving your instructions, the moral support of e preseu war would, I think, be useful.into prison at Muscat. Shaikh Abdullah, however, managed to remain at liberty and thwart the Mutowwa power ia every possible way. ihis led baiyid Azzan to instigate the Bani bu Hassan and the A1 Waheebeh to wage war against the Bani bu Ali. A serious engagement took place at Lazzeh in which : Abdullah defeated the two Hinawi tribes, and in revenge for which the Bani bu Hasan rose again only to be defeated a second time at Seh al Masaddee. 7 In 1*70 Saiyid Toorkee having requested the help of the Bani bu Ali they joined him at Sur and 200 of their number marched under Sheikh Abdullah and Yoosuf against Mat rah where they both took a leading part in scaling the wall and in the engagement which resulted in the death of Saiyid Azzan bin Kais and subsequently restoring order and holding the place till Saiyid Toorkee’s arrival from Sur. In recognition of their services Saiyid Toorkee granted the Amirs of the Bani bu Ali exemption from the payment of Customs on the goods imported by them into Sur. 8. In 1895 the Bani bu Ali sent detachments in support of Saiyid Eaisal when he was attacked at Muscat by Salih bin Ali but they made no deter mined effort to expel the rebels and recover the capital for their sovereign.. In recognition of their services Saiyid Eaisal granted the Amirs of the Bani bu Ali an allowance of dollars 100 per mensem. 9. In the Spring of 1903, the ordinary annual hostilities between the Ghafiris and Hinawis of Shariqiyah being then in progress, Abdullah bin Salim found reason to suspect that the people of Sur, though Ghafiris, were supplying his enemies with the sinews of war. He accordingly marched down the coast and declared the harbour blockaded until his demands for satisfaction were complied with. After Abdullah had returned to the interior, relations between his supporters in the Aiqa quarter anu his opponents in. Muqraimatain became so strained, that when Major Cox arrived there in August, he found the twm factions on the point of opening fire on each other across the intervening creek. The Bolitical Agent, baying obtained a tiuce for 18 hours, returned at once to Muscat and informed the Sultan, who immediately pro* ceeded to the spot. The Jerebeh would not at once submit to his mediation, and, before proceedings had commenced in earnest, the Sultan w r as called away by serious newo? from Bustaq, nevertheless his visit actually averted tighbing for the moment, and the dispute was adjusted, not long after, by neutral Sheikhs of the neighbourhood. (Lorimer, Yol. I, page 580.) 10. In 1913 Sheikh Abdullah bin Salim Al Alawi died. He w'as con sidered a very'daring man, w T ell disposed towards the Sultans of Muscat and alw r ays ready to help them. His eldest son Naser had predeceased him and as the latter’s son Mahomed w r as still a minor, Abdullah’s second.son Ali W as made! Amir jointly with Mahomed bin INaser, an arrangement which still continues. 11. During the 1913-19 rebellion the Bani bu Ali took the part of the Sultan, but, since the time Mahomed bin Naser started to assert his authority, relations betweea the Amirs and the Sultan have undergone a change. In 1920 the Wazir cut the allowances paid to the Baui bu Ali through misdirected economy but Mr. Wingate restored it. In 1923 the Amirs sent a petition to Government claiming that the port of Snr belonged to them and that the Sultan had nothing to do with the said Port ; that the Sultan did not supply them with arms and ammunition according to agreement; and asking that they might enter into direct relations with the Government of India. Govern ment replied that they were unable to intervene on their behalf. 12. In 1924 Mahomed bin Naser informed Major Hinde that he wms authorized by the Muscat Government to settle all disputes in Sur and had succeeded in doing so w-ith the exception of Khamis bin Mubarak of the Arama section. Erom the records of the Council of Ministers it appears that Mahomed bin Naser wrote to the Sultan in March 1924 offering to effect a settlement between the Jenebeh sections. The Sultan replied, permitting him to intervene during the “ Salifah ” period, but a&amp;er this period he was not to interfere in anything. In 1925 Mahomed bin Naser also attempted to foist 7 a Sheikh (Said bin Sultan bin Mahomed) on the Jenebeh at Sur. 1 his action was resented and failed.8 13. In September 1924 Major Hinde visited Sur and reported. “ I then enquired how it was I had received news that the Sheikh did not permit the new Customs House at Sur to be built. Mahomed bin Naser became evasive and said nothing had ever been sett.ed about it, finally denying that he had ever agreed to its being built and that he never would agree. He went on to say that the right of His Highness to collect customs at Sur and Aiqa had never been recognized by his forebears himself and his tribe.” 14. In 1925 Colonel Prideaux remarked that the Amirs were not very loyal to the Sultan and that if they had done their duty and given the Wall of Sur all the support he was entitled to there would have been no question of paying a ransom for the release of a Hindu who was kidnapped by a Bedouin. 15. In December 1925 in protesting against having obtain a fC No Objec tion ” certificate from the Political Agent before being allowed to import arms and ammunition from Bombay Mahomed bin Naser wrote to the Government of India ; “ I submit that this request of the Political Department of Bo?nbay is not fair to me as a ruler of an independent state and it would be highly detri mental to my dignity to ask for consent or certificate from the Political*A^ent Muscat. I hold the Political Agent in high regard but I think you will appreciate that I. prefer to preserve the dignity of my state, not to do an act detrimental to its independent position. Mahomed bin Naser has at present as his Lieutenants (1) Abdullah bin Saleh, a Habshi, who was his Agent in Bombay, speaks English and is reputed to have drafted Mahomed bin Naser’s letter to the Government of India. (2) Mahomed bin Said, a Syrian whom he engaged about four months a^o to teach his children. Deputed to know a little English and to be much travelled Appendix II. Historical Summary of the Jtnebeh. In 1865 the Jenebeh of Sur who were discontented with the Sultan y s rule, sought Wahabi assistence from Baraim and the Wahabi a^ent nothin^ loth, sent a contingent who plundered Suq Sur, assisted*by the &amp; Jenebeh and Bani bu Ali. Nearly all the damage iaflicted fell on Hindu traders and shop keepers of the place, who were British Indian subjects; the extent of thpir losses was estimated at dollars 27,700, and one of their number was killed *nd another was wounded. Before being allowed to leave for Muscat they w ere stripped of almost all their clothing. ^ 2 It appearei to Colonel Pelly that a prompt and severe example should ie made of those Arabs (of the Jenebeh tribe) who were implicated with the Wahabis m the plunder and murder of our subjects at Sur. There were oth*r reasons too. which called for the punishment of the Jenebeh. Thev had Iona* bten notorious among our naval officers as the most cruel and unscrupulous slavers and pirates. They were among the Arab slave dealers who bad conspired m 1861 to assassinate the British Agent at Zanzibar for his anti si very proceedings. It was also believed that they were concerned in the murder of three seamen of M M. S. « Wasp ” who had disappeared from theTr craft a few months before. The Sultan of Muscat was assured of their crimi nality ana had himself proceeded to Sur live or six months previously with the intention of punishing them, but was obliged to return to Muscat ovine to a conspiracy to dethrone him. Colonel Belly had also in the precedin'- month sent the Berenice to Sur with a letter addressed to the Beads of the Jenebeh demanding payment of 27,000 dollars as compensation for the property plundered by them from British subiects and P t„? • them that measures would be taken to enforce Te ’demand The? reply was “That on a former occasion when Lieutenant Pengelly threatened a tribe on the coast, nothing was done, and that they were qX sure the ixesident would not come now. ^ quite sure tne * . 'I- , 0n th ® llth of .February 1866, H. M. S. “ Highflyer ” appeared off t0 mslst 011 atonement % the Jenebeh for their part in the affair^f August, bypayment of 27 700 dollars compensation within 24 hours. On the tribe attempt ing to procrastinate, a fire was opened which demolished their fort; the whole of their boats were either confiscated or destroyed ; and a large quantity ot their ship timber was burnt. No. personal injury was suffered by nom combatants who had ample opportunity to move, but a small part ot the town w r as burnt accidentally, in consequence of a change m the direction of the w ni. . 4. In the month of June 1875 a godown belonging to the principal Indian trader at Sur, a bania named Jethanund Motamull, w^as broken into, during his absence on business at Muscat by a party of the Jenebeh tribe who offered violence to the watchman in charge and carried off plunder to the value of about dollars 1,600. The spoil was openly sold in the town, and the robbers made no attempt at concealment of themselves, but no steps were taken by the Sheikhs of the tribe to cause restitution, and.it does not even appear that they offered to remonstrate wfith, or repress, their tribesmen. 5. There was no wall or other authority on behalf of the Sultan at Sur at the time, w ho could have taken action in the matter, and . the bania therefore, on returning to Sur shortly after the outrage and discovering his loss, reported the matter to Colonel Miles and the case was referred to His Highness who promised redress. 6 Soon after this H M. S. “ Rifleman” happened to arrive at Sur, and the Sheikhs of the Jenebeh, apprehensive that her arrival was connected with the outrage committed by their tribesmen, and fearing the results seized the offenders and would have doubtless caused restitution to be made to the trader but H M S. “ Rifleman ” w^hich only dropped anchor for a few hours inci dentally in passing, having in the meantime weighed and proceeded on her voyagcf the Sheikhs perceived how matters stood and released their tribesmen without further question. . 7 During His Highness Saiyid Turki’s absence at Guadar in 1875 the case was presented to His Highness Saiyid Abdul Aziz, but without any beneficial result. About this time, however, the Sheikhs of thetnbe went to the bania and offered an arrangement promising to make good the loss m eight months. This arrangement they afterward repudiated, H. Saiyi Turki was on different occasions reminded of the matter after his return, but he was not able to put sufficient pressure on the tribe, to cause them to make good the loss sustained at their hands, or to bring them to account for their misconduct, and they succeeded in procrastinating and delaying to reply to H. H. until the season opened and they could get away in their bughlahs. 8 H H finally informed Colonel Miles that he left the mattei in the hands of Government and as the latter considered the continued failure of the Jenebeh tribe to cause restitution to a British _ subject plundered by them iniurious to British interests, he supported H. H. s request that the enforce - ment if reparations might be undertaken by Government. To have held H. H. personally responsible for the loss sustained at the Jenebeh s hands would have tended still further to weaken H. H. s authority and w ould haie encouraged the predatory Arabs to continue their depredations on British subjects at H. H. 5 s expense ; while the exaction of reparation from^this tribe would on the other hand, be a cautionary warning to all. Colonel W. X. Prideaux the Political Resident, also suggested that besides the original amount a fine of do Bars 2,000 should be levied on the Jenebeh, partly as com- pensation foiTthe delay ip settling (it was then October 1876) and partly as a penalty for the offence committed against a British subject. 9 At first however, the Government of India would not comply with the Sultan’s request, claiming that the repressionofcrimeandthepumslimen of criminals in the dominion of Maskat was the duty ^J 16 . Sul *“ ’Xi n t to in return for the responsibility which it has incurred “ j cuivid Turk! the navment of the Zanzibar subsidy, and for other material aK 'wInch ad been afforded to H. H. from time to time, the Government of India might fairly expect that the punishment of offenders in Oman would ber 10 effectually carried out, in so far at least as offences against British subjects were concerned, without requisitions being made on the British Goyernment for armed intervention. 10. The Sudan’s efforts to comply with this attitude of Government were so feeble and ineffective thcit finally in July 1877, the Political Agent was authorized by Government to proceed to Sur in H. M. S. “ Teazer ” and convey the Sultan’s demands. When the Political Agent arrived at Sur on the 24th July, he wrote to the Jenebeh enclosing H. H.’s order, and warned them that if they failed to comply to it within 24 hours, measures of a coercive nature would follow. The Jenebeh had no recognized head at the time, the nominal Shaikh being a boy as yet without authority, but several of the leading men came on board in reply to the letter. They expressed their readi ness to comply with H. H.’s order, but explained that the absence of a recog nized authority amongst them rendered it necessary for each member of the tribe to pay his share at once, as, were some to pay on behalf of the rest, their chance of re-imbursement would be small. On this ground, and on the ground that several of their principal men were inland fighting with the Bani bu Hassan, they asked for an extension of time, and were allowed until sunset on the 25th 11. By noon of the 25th Jethanund’s claim, amounting to dollars 1,600, had been satisfied, partly by a money payment, and partly by a bu^hlah of which he had received possession. At sunset the Governor of Soor and Jethanund came on board. The former delivered to the Political A&lt;?ent dollars 2,000. and the latter stated that his claim against the Jenebeh^had been fully satisfied. t Pi Government expressed satisfaction with the results obtained and directed that tlie fine of dollars 2,000 should be paid to Saiyid Turki after deductions of the expenses incurred in the measures which had’been taken. 13. In 1898, the Jenebeh were making representations to the Sultan with a view to obtaining the recall of Suleiman bin Suwevlim’s son who was acting as his fathers representative in the Governorship‘of Soor. As the Sultan had declined to acquiesce in the demands of the Jenebeh and as in consequence of His Highness’ attitude the situation had become critical the Political Agent, Maskat, submitted to the Political Resident the followino- miel history of the occurrences which led to the crisis. the 21st 1 Ma , rch , Suleiman arrived at Soor from Dhofar and on the 26th he summoned the Sheikhs of the Jenebeh and informed them that m future he would not respect Khafir and would seize the persons and pro perty of those who belonged to tribes whom he considered unfriendly I would here exp am that the - Khafir ” system of protection amounts to this that when a parly or a caravan wish to pass through the country of another nube and take with them as escort a man belonging to the tribe through whose country they wish to. pass, that party or caravan is safe from attack and is so to speak sacred till it returns to its own country. 15. The “ Khafir ” is respected to such an extent that members of a tribe tiavellmg under this protection through the country of a tribe with which they even have a blood feud, are safe. * lllch 46. When the Jenebeh heard of Suleiman bin Suweylum’s intention to disregard this firmly established custom of the tribes of Oman they asked he latter whether he really meant to imply that he would not respect the perLn a,id property of a tribesman coming into Soor under the protection of a member of their tribe, to which Suleiman replied that he would 'such a man even m the house of the “ Khafir ” himself. This answer i Us need ess to say, aroused the greatest indignation among the Jenebeh. On the same day Suleiman left Soor and proceeded to Maskat leaving his son a lad of 12 or n years ot age in charge of the Governorship of the place and on the 6th Zril Suleiman wrote (presumably with the consent of the Sultan) to his son at Snm- * u ' h ~~nai.is.is tCi su PPv the town and the caravan route to the interior.

The Sheikh thereupon advanced up to the walls under a flag of truce and' called upon the garrison to surrenler A parley then ensued and an agreement was arrived at, Saleh bin Yasser guaranteeing that the Wal’s son and the beleaguered garrison would be escorted in safety to the co so and placed on board a vessel bound for Maskat. The fort was accordingly evacuated and the party embarked and arrived at Muscat on the 7th. 27 Before returning to their homes the rebels destroyed the new and half built* - ort re erred 10 above. The Sheikhs wrote to the Sultan offering to hand over the f ut to any one deputed by His Highness to take it over except Suleiman b n Suvveylim and his son and the Sultan despatched a fresh garrison of 25 men under Hamad bin Saif A1 Amri. The Sultan wrote a con ciliatory letter to the Sheikhs informing them that he pardoned them for their lite act of rebellion but it was generally believed that His Highness had only done this to put the Jenebeh off their guard and to attack them when they were unprepared for resistance. 23. On the llthl October Sheikh Abdu'lah bin Amir, the head Sheikh of the Beni Bahsib, called on the Political Agent and stated that he had been deputed by the Jenebeh to ascertain from him whether the British Govern ment had any intention of interfering in the quarrel between the tribe and the Sultan, He added that the Jenebeh felt quite able to hold their own against any attack that could hi made against them by His Highness by land, but being a maritime tribe they knew that they would he powerless to resist the Sultan if the latter were aided by our ships, as in the case of Dhofar. The Political Agent replied thnt he was not in a position to give them any positive assurances on this point but that speaking generally he should say that any such inference would be very unlikely so long as British interests were un assailed and British subjects remained unmolested. 29. On the 20th October the garrison under Hamad bin Seif A1 Amri wltich were despatched to take over the fort at Soor from the Jenebeh returned to Maskat and on the following day Sheikh Rashid bin Muhammad, a wealthy Arab merchant of Jissa, who had also been sent to Soor to endeavour to con ciliate the Je ebeh arrived with a letter to the Sultan from Saeed bin Baser, the head Sheikh of the tribe in which the latter while thanking His Highness for the free pardon granted to the tribe informed him at the same time that His Highness’ garrison could not be allowed to take possession of the fort until the Jenebeh were first as sured under the guarantee of theBritish Government that no attempt would in future be made to re-appoint Suleiman bin Suweylim as Governor of Soor. 30. Sheikh Rashid further informed the Sultan that the young bloods of the rebel tri;e were in favour of destroying the Sultan s fort and assuming an attitude of defiance against His Highness 5 authority, but that they were overruled by the elders who sent the letter of which he w r as the bearer. 31. On the same day the Sultan received a communication from the custom s farmer stating that the Jenebeh Sheikhs had directed him to withhold payment 0 f the customs receipts from the Sultan with the exception of the amount collected as punitive tax for compensation of British subjects for losses during the late rebellion. 32. Two Sheikhs of the Jenebeh who flew French flags on their dhow and were therefore under French protection arrived at Muscat on the 21st with Rashid bin Muhammad. They both paid visits to Mons. Ottawi but not to the Sultan. The object of their visit to Muscat was not known but it was believed that they had come to purchase arms and ammunition and to watch events. 33 Saiyid Muhammad bin Hamad, accompanied by a garrison of 60 men, took possession of the fort at Soor on the 25th November. The fort was found to have been entirely dismantled, all the wood work having been earned away and nothing left but the bare walls. The Sultan sent 20 barrels of gunpowder and 4,000 ball cartridges for the use of the garrison at Soor and ordered 1 tbe wali to place, the fort in repair.was released in 1924. Meeting an armed slave of the murdered sheikh on the outskirts of Sur, he decided the man had been detailed to kill him and fired and killed the slave. This started indiscriminate firing between the sections in which an A rama boy was killed. The Euwaris then took a hand and seized a water donkey belonging to the Arama and a struggle ensued in which an Arama girl was killed. The YVali was able to use the Ramzan fast for arrang ing a 45 days armistice. 41. About this time (1924) Mahomed bin Naser, Amir of the Bani bu AH started to take an interest in the affairs of the Jenebeh, having formed an alliance with Mansur bin Naser Jenebeh Sheikh of Masirah, and. won over the Makhanah and Al Ghialin sections in Sur—the w r eaker party in the feud among the Jeneb h—to acknowledge his authority. 42. In 1925, Sheikh Mansur bin Naser went to Sur, informed the Hindu community that there was no Sultan’s Government in Sur and that they w r ere to look to him for justice. He tried to form a committee of leading men for the administration of justice as the local wa;i had been found incapable. The Wali told the Hindus that he was powerless and that they should inform the British Government. 43. In 1927 Sheikh Mansur bin Naser of Masirah (mentioned above) accompanied by Hamdan bin Naser and Salim bin Naser, brother of Mahomed bin Naser of the Bani bi Ali stayed at Mecca for three months as the guests of His Majesty Ibn Sand. Mansur bin Naser diel of small pox on the return journey. APPENDIX III. Summary or recent events in Sur. In 1927, the Arama and Makhana sections of the Jenebeh each built three new forts in their quarters against the orders of the Wali. 2. In August 1927, Mr. Thomas, Minsiter of Finance went to Sur. As it transpires afterwards, one of his objects was to arrange for a journey w hich he proposed making overland from Sur to Dhofar for which he required the assistance of the Bani bu Ali. He attempted to induce the Jenebeh to pay 2J lakhs of rupees which they owe Khan Bahadur Nasib and Ali Musa Khan, merchants of Muscat, and tried to induce them to pull down the forts which they had built. It appeared to Mr. Thomas that the opposition to this came mainly from the Arama section and on leaving Sur, in the Al Saeed, he took in to,w r an Arama sambuk lying in the harbour, whereupon the Al Saeed w r as fired on by the Arama section. 3. The Council of Ministers fined the Arama section Rs. 10,000 and ordered the destruction of their three forts but they have not been able to enforce this and have been looking to the British Government to assist them in doing so. 1928. 4. On the 10th April, the Council of Ministers received information that the Amirs of the Bani bu Ali had established a customs port at Aiqa. Their customs officer wrote to the state customs official at Sur demanding refund of customs which the state had levied on a boat which they said belong to the Bani bu Ali. 5. The Amirs refused to furnish any explanation regarding the customs post to Saiyid Shahab, brother of His Highness and Sheikh Rashid, Minister of Shara who had gone to Sur to investigate the recent trouble there, 6. The Amirs are stated to have stopped a boat of the Arama section from enteringThe creek whereupon Sheikh Yaser al Majaala, who has only recently come to prominence as Sheikh of the Jenebeh, prevented a Bani bu Ali boat from entering the creek. 7. The Bani bu Ali then occupied Balad as Sur, possibly with a view to commanding the water supply of Sur. On 15th April they were attacked in Balad at Sur by about 70 men of the Arama and Fuwaris under the leadershipANNEXURE I. Translation of a letter dated 27th Dhil Hejjeh 1346 (16th June 1928) No. 64, from the Council of Ministers to the Sultan of Muscat, to Mr. Q. Gazder, representative of the Political Agent, Muscat, in his absence. After Complements. We have the pleasure t&amp; reply to your letter No. C.-97, dated the 13th June 1928, in which you asked us, in accordance with tbe instructions of the Political Agent, to inform you of the opinion of the Council in respect of the letter of the Beni Bu Ali Shaikhs of Ja’alan and their deeds. Indeed we understand from their letter that they demand 10,000 riyals to meet the expenses of their halting at Sur to fight the Irama. Decision of the Council is as under :— 1. The Council does not accept this proposal and demand as it has no precedence. 2. After their arrival at Sur, as soon as we received reports of their deeds, we sent some Deputies in order to enquire from them about this action and inform them that the Council does not wish that any measure be taken now at Sur, hut they did not listen to the orders of the Council and persisted in their intentions. They even said that if the Government do not agree to their occupation their demands should be granted. Finally Sayid Shahab and Shaikh Rashid asked them to stop hostilities for two days in order to refer the matter to the Council but without result. 3. When they (Deputies) saw their persistence in their demand they discussed the question of tbe Customs which they had established at Aiqa but they did not give any answer and made a truce between themselves without reference to the Government. Keeping their objects in view they are making preparation to attain their ends and the Government of Muscat has not taken any action in the matter up to now. We have received a letter dated the 14th Dhil Hejjeh 1346 from Shaikh Isa bin Salih at Harithi in which he says “ If you neglected the matter I should not be blamed (for any action which may be taken by me). Sur is a port of call for us and our tribesmen. You should help us against those who have been aggressive and rebelled against their masters. Negligence is not advisable in every affair.” The Council has therefore arrived at the decision that if the Government do not take any measure to check the move ments of Beni Bu Ali, the result will be very had as the Omanis who do not like the suzerainty of Beni Bu Ali at Sur may take advantage of this opportunity to make interference at Sur. After one week we will depute Sayid Shahab bin Eaisal as Wali for Sur. Usual ending. ANNEXUR II. Translation of a letter from the Council of Ministers to H. H. the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Muscat, to the Political Agent and H. B. M’s. Consul, Muscat, No. 71/61, dated the 29th June 1928. After Compliments, We trust that you are in perfect health. Captain Walker attended the Majlis yesterday and stated that you had asked him to enquire from the Council of Ministers about the state of affairs at Sur, and about the sons of Abdullah bin Salim al Hamuda, Amirs of Beni Bu Ali, the situation of Sur and its importance to the Government of Muscat, the recent events which took place there and continues up to now, the objects of the sons of Hamuda and their intentions at Sur, the effect of their inter ference and actions, views of the Majlis as to what measure should be taken for checking the said individuals and what support the Government of Muscat18 should expect from the High British Government as they used to give in important affairs, and that the views of the Majlis are required before any action be taken in the matter. We therefore submit to you our views and opinions in details on the subject. Usual Ending. Decision of Majlis. The port of Sur is an important port to the Government of Muscat and is considered to be the third port in importance after Muscat and Matrah from a commercial point of view as it is a port in which goods are imported from the Eastern Oman and an important bazaar for its tribes. Goods are imported into Sur by land as well as by sea and also exported from it. The Government of Muscat receive a considerable amount of revenue from Sur. This is from the economical and commercial point of view. As regards its political situation Sur is one of the important ports to the Government of Muscat as it is a resort for all tribes of that part who arrive and depart there for the purpose of transaction of business. Eor that reason the Government of Muscat had absolute influence and control over that part. The inhabitants of Sur are almost the four sections of the Jenabah tribe and are obedient to the Government who make peace and settle their internal disputes whenever they arise between them. As regards the sons of al Hamuda, Chiefs of Beni Bu Ali of Ja’alan, they were since olden times obedient to the orders of and friendly to the Muscat Government. Shaikh Abdullah bin Salim father of these Chiefs w T as especially a faithful friend of the Muscat Government. He used to assist with his followers in affairs concerning the Muscat Government whenever he was called upon to do so and maintained that attitude till the end of his life. The Muscat Government in recognilion of his services sanctioned a monthly allow'- ance for him. When he died his sons, viz. Ali bin Abdullah and Muhammad bin Nasir succeeded him and at the beginning of their rule followed in the footsteps of their late father in consequance of w T hich the Government agreed to pay the same allowance to them which their father used to get it. Their behaviour has recently changed at the instigation of some one and consequently they have put forward some claims which they have no right to do nor their fathers wUo w r ere before them had enjoyed such privileges. In 192T hostilities and fighting broke out between the two tribes namely Aramah and Makhanah which continues up to now. The sons of Hamudah asked the Government of Muscat for permission to make peace between the aforesaid tribes and the Council accorded this to them. This request was made by them both verbally and in w r riting and their letters are on the record of the Majlis. Thev interfered at the beginning in the attairs of Sur in this way but they had another object in view and that was their absolute control over Janabah and Sur. They were not contented with this but established a Customs House at Aiqa for collecting revenue and notified openly to that effect. Owing to the hostilities between the Aramah and Makbanah they have recently entered Sur wdth their force in order to establish their authority over the inhabitants pretending that they had been ordered by the Government of Muscat to make peace between al Aramah and al Makhanah tribes but they have got a different object in view. They have commenced hostilities and fighting w r ith those who did not comply with their wishes. The Majlis then sent Deputies to Sur to investigate into the affair but they (Beni Bu Ali) told them that they w r ere acting according to the orders of the Government. The Deputies asked them to stop the fighting which was against the wishes of the Government but they did not obey and thus fchoir secret intentions that is their control over Sur, collection of revenue and aggiession to the inhabitants became known. In view r of the foregoing facts it is necessary that the condition of Sur should be put right and saved from these transgressions because Sur is considered as one of the limbs of the Muscat Government and no other authority but the Government of Muscat should rule over it.As to the political point of view, Sur is a centre for all affairs concerning the Eastern parts as has already been stated by ns. The Muscat Gfoveriiment can exercise their authority over those parts and their people who are great in number as long as Sur is under their control, and do not wish to cease their relations with them. II. The said tribes themselves do not agree to any other authority at Sur besides the Muscat Government especially the Oman tribes who will rot hesitate to seize the opportunity of stepping into Sur if the Government neglected it and therefore the Muskat Government are obliged to take steps to keep off the Shaikhs of Beni Bu Ali from Sur. III. From the financial point of view there is no doubt that losses would be incurred if the condition is changed at Sur and particularly if another Customs House besides the Government’s would be established there. If a Customs House besides that of Muskat Government be established near Sur the boats will visit that Customs without the information of the Government and thus they will find an open way for dealing in the prohibited trade which, the*Government of Muscat has undertaken to suppress it. The Arabs as it is their habit were endeavouring to find a means to do so _ It should, be known that the sons of Hamudah are Shaikhs at Ja’alan and Chiefs of their own tribe Beni Bu Ali only. They have no right to exercise any control over Sur and if the Government of Muskat withdraw their authority the tribes of Ja’alan and the Eastern parts of Oman who are stronger than them (Beni Bu All) will rise against them. The Council of Ministers are of opinion that by the assistance of the British Government they should proceed by a Man-of-war to Sur where they .would discuss matters with the subjects and effect a settlement in the disputes between them in any way that the Government deem advisable and if some of them do not agree to the adjudications of the Government they should be punished. Then the sons of al Hamudah should be warned to refrain from interfering with the affairs of the subjects of Sur, to abolish the Customs House which they had established at Aiqa, to pull down the building which they had erected at the entrance of the creek as there was no such building before and its existence will cause a loss to the Muscat Government and the subjects and by means of that building they can prevent boats from entering the crtek or going out of it and take taxes from them. These are the views of the Majlis with regard to Sur affairs and the con dition is as has been explained by us. The Muscat Government request H. B. M.’s Government to support them as they used to support the Muscat Government and their Sultans. ANNEX III. Translation of letter dated Bombay, 18th Muharram 1347 (6th July 1928), from H. H. Sayid Taimur bin Faisal, Sultan of Muscat, to Major G. P. Murphy, Political Agent and U. B. Mis Consul, Muscat. After compliments. I have to inform you by this letter to confirm our personal con- versation regarding Sur affairs and the interference of the Shaikhs of Beni Bu Ali. I hope you will kindly submit this information to our friend the Government and draw their attention with a view to favoui us with com plete assistance to prevent the said people from their action and to do away with any establishment that they have made at Sur and Janabah which they have no right to do. I have received a'letter from the Council of Ministers of my State dated 19th Dhil Qadeh 3.346 (8th June 1928) describing the trouble which has been created by the Shaikhs of Beni Bu Ali in fighting with the Janabah, subjects of Sur, without any order from me or the Council of Ministers. They have also preveuted the Janabah’s boats from entering the creek and have destroyed;20 their properties which were lying near the State fort where the Wall resides. They have levied a tax on vessels which enter the creek and have established a Customs House at Aiqa. All these actions are against us and disturb our State’s administration. Beni Bu Ali have no right ^interfere in Sur affairs without our permission or from our representative at that place. As you know Beni Bu Ali are subjects of Muscat as other tribes are and whenever their assistance is required in any matter they have to execute our order at Sur or other countries. I now request H. B. M.’s Government to afford us strong support in order to prevent the Shaikhs of Beni Bu Ali from any action which they intend to take at Sur district as they have no historical right to do so. The pressure which has been brought by Beni Bu Ali on the Janabah is due to the fact that they think that we would not get any support 10m the Government You are well aware that our Government had request ed tor help m connection 'with Sur affairs since a long time and without the Government assistance they would not be able to prevent them and manage affairs concerning the Customs administration, etc. If the Janabah tribe even now get the least assistance from us they would never submit to Beni Bu Ali’^ demands. 13 The Council of Ministers forwarded to me the letter which they had received from the Shaikh of Beni Bu Ali demanding payment of expense 8 H f T nt du T S tll , eir fi g htiD 8 with the Janabah as they considered that then last action was by order of our Government. If their statement was true they would not have opposed the Deputies of my Government Ministers unrg then- last agressions at Sur. Under these circumstances we will never accept their demand because we did not order them at all, and if thev had been ordered by my Government to rise against the Janabah there would' have been a representative on our behalf with them. If our friend the Government will not attempt to assist my state in the affans of Sur and its dependencies at an early date the result will be unsatisfac tory. You are aware about the opinions of the Shaikhs of other tribes in connection with the actions of this (Beni Bu Ali) tribe, and the weak ness of oui Government ar.d lack of support from our friend H B M’s Government. Therefore I have sanguine hope that the Government will not BWtbdfr ^ ^ tt,ls l ! n I ,ortant P olut to which my Government as well as the British Government is giving due attention. a. Th ® cause of del .ay in writing this letter is due to fact that I wished to discuss the matter with you personally. In reality the Council of Ministers se to send reports to me since the beginning of the trouble asking for a de finite answer but I did not send any as I considered that they had been fullv authorised by me to take action m important affairs. They have undoubtedlv explained the whole facts to you. I have now'- deemed it necessary to acquaint Ktasasr' 1 ' - ** »&gt;■* j-vts both ^parties. 1118 ' 011 1 h ° Pe “ SinCerity and frie!:dshi P will endure between GIF©—674(C) I'&amp;PD—7*11-28 30.1 cultivation oi lucerne and about 250 houses of various tribes who supply Sur with vegetables and fodder.

According to the Gazetteer } there were at one time over 100 Indian traders at Sur,but these numbers gradually dwindled down owing to the insecurity of the place. At present there are only 20 British subjects in Sur. These British merchants are living on suffranco having to pay blackmail to the v.rious Sheikhs of the Jennebeh in order to avoid being looted. I understand that since the kidnapping of a Baniah in 1926jllahomed Bin Baser, Amir of the Sani 3u Ali, has not hiself levied anything from the Banias but that he is suspected of instigating others to do so.

Jd In t]ie spring of 1903, the ordinarp - annual hostilities between the Ohafiris and Hihawis of Shar(iip r ah being then in progress, Abdulla bin Salim f found reason to suspect that the people of Surjitaxg though Crhaf iris, -ere supplying his enemies with the sinews of war. He accordingly marched down the coast and declared the harbour blockaded until his demands for satisfaction were complied —ith. After Abdulla had returned to the interior,relations between his supporters in the Aiqa quarter and his opponents in Huqraimatain became so strained,that when Major Cox arrived there in August,he found the t” r o factions on the point of opening fire on each other across the intervening creek. The Political Agent,having obtained a truce for 48 hours,returned at once to Muscat and informed the Sultan,who immediately proceeded to the spot. The Jenebeh would not at once submit to his mediation,and, before proceedings had commenced in earnest,the Sultan was called away bp serious news from Hustaq;nevertheless his visit actually averted fighting for the moment, and. the dispute ^as adjusted,not long after,by neuta? -±al Sheikhs of the neighbourhood. (lorimer Vol l.p.580.)?/ In 191 3,Sheikh. Abdullah bin Salim XI Ala^i died. He was considered a very daring man,well disposed towards the Sultans of Muscat and always ready to help them. His' eldest son Kaser had predeceased him and as the latters son Mahomed was still a minor,A o du1las second son Ali was made Amir pointlp witn l^cvnom^d bin Maser. An arrangement which still continues. JA- During the 1S13-19 rebellion,the 3ani Bu Ali took the part of the Sultan but their behaviour ^as not altogether satisfactory. They sent the rice given them for their progress inland to their homes at Sur and also left behind the ammunition with which the Sultan had provided them,at Muscat for taking to their homes at the first convenient opportunity and then on their arri- -val at Sib,were demanding extra supplies of both food and ammunition. They retreated unexpectedly a,nd unaccountably from Bidbid,where they ^ere first established,to 7/atiyah. On being brought back to Muscat,much alarm was felt owing to their reputation for looting and general misbehaviour. Their counci Id were divided,they quarrelled bitterly amongst themselves and paid little attention to the authority of their nominal leader Mahomed bin Maser and it was only with great difficulty that they could be induced to obey orders of any kind. In one quarrel amongst them- -selves which arose over pilfering by some of them in the bazaar whom the Sheikh -.Ashed to punish, stones and sticks TrT ere freely used with the result Aks: that there were several heads broken,Even the Sheikh himself was stoned.Since the time Mahomed 'bin Na.ser started to assert his authority,relations between the Amirs and the Sultan have undergone a change. In 1920 the T/azir cut the allowances paid to the Bani Bu Ali through misdirected economy hut Mr Y,'ingate restored them. jlf. In 1923,the Anirs sent a petition to Government claiming that the port of Sur belonged to them and that the Sultan had nothing to do with the said port; that the Sultan did not supply them with arms and ammunition according to agreement and asking that they might enter into direct relations with the Y Government of India. Government replied that they T * r ere unable to intervene on their behalf. This claim to independence on the part of the Amirs of Jaalan appears to be based on the compact- entered into by the YTahabi Sheikh on his invasion , of Oman when certain Sheikhs v were constituted Ameers or territorial lords in their own right^without any dependence on Muscat. (B.G.Becords XXIV p,4&lt;.,« ) In 1924 # Mahomed bin Baser informed Major Hinde that he was authorized b;- the Muscat Government to settle all disputes in Sur and had succeeded in doing so with the exception of Khamis bin Mubarak of the Arama section. From the records of tne Council of Ministers it appears that Mahomed bin Baser wrote to the Sultan in March 1924 offering to effect a settlement between the Jenebeh sections The Sultan replied permitting him to interfere during tae Salifah period,but after this period he wasxnot to interfere in anything. d p. 1 IMajor Hinde then enquired how it was that the Sheikh ddd not permit the new customs house to he built at Sur. Mahomed bin leaser became evasive and said nothing had ever been settled about it, finally denying that he had ever agreea to its being built and that he ne\er would agree. He went on to say that the right o* Hio Aiigitne^o to collect customs at Sur and Aiqa had never oeen recognised by his forbears himself or his tribe. In I9b5, Colonel Prideaux rexsarxced tnat the Amirs were not very loyal to the Cultan and that ii they had done ilieir duty and given the tali of Sur all the support he was entitled to tuere would have been no question of paying a ransom for for the release of a Hindu who *^as kidnapped by a Bedouin. In December 192b, in protesting against having to obtain a K Ho objection M certificate from the Political agent before being allowed to import arms and arnmunition from Botibay,Mahomcd bin Hase i rote; to the Croveriament of India,. I submit that this request of the Political Department of Bombay not fair to me as a ruler of an independant sta^e and it would be highly detrimental to my dignity to ask for consent or certificate iron the Political Agent Muscat. I hold tne Political Agent in high legard buu I think you will appreciate that I prefer to preserve the dignity of my state not to do an act detrimental to its independant possession.

There \.ere other reasons too T hhich called for the punishment of this tribe. They had lour been notorious among our naval officers as the most cruel and unscrupulous slavers and pirates. slrey were among the Arab slave dealers teho had conspired in 1861 to assassinate the British agent at Zanzioar ror his anti slavery proceedings. It t as also believed that they were, concerned in the murder of three seamen of H.M.SAfasp who had disappeared from their craft a few months before. t.ne Sultan oi Hus cat was assured of their criminal! and nad himself proceeded to Sur five or six months previously ’~ith the intention of punishing them, but w as obliged to return to Muscat owing to a conspiracy to dethrone him. Colonel Pally had also in the preceding month sent the Berenice to Sur with a letter addressed to the heads of the Jenebeh demanding payment of $ 27000 as compensation for the property plundered by them from British subjects and warning them that measures would be taken to enforce the demand. Their reply was that on a former occasion when Lieut. Pengelly threatened a tribe on the coast nothing was done and they.were quite sure the Resident would not come now. On the 11 th Feb. 1866,H,M.S.Highflyer appeared off Sur to insist on attonement by the Jenebeh for their part in the affairs of August,by payment of 27700/- compensation within 24 hours. On the tribe attempting to procrastinate,a fire w as opened which demolished their fort,the whole of uneii boats were either confiscated or burnt and a large quantity of their ship timber was burnt. Mo personal injury was suffered b;, non combatants who had ample one or-opportunity to move 'but a small part of the town T ' T as burnt accidentally in consequence of a change in the direction if the wind. In the month of June 1875,a godown belonging to the principal Indian trader of Sur,a Banian named Jetha- -nand Motamull was broken into during his absence on business at Muscat by a party of Jenebeh who offered to the watchman in charge and carried off plunder to the value of about jfri 0 1600/-. The spoil -’ r as openly sold in the town and the robbers made no attempt at concealment of themselves but no steps were taken by the Sheikhs of the tribe to cause restitution amd it does not even appear that they offered to remonstrat with of suppress their tribesmen. There was no Vali or otner authority on behalf of the Sultan at Sur at the time who could have taken action in the matter and the Banian therefore reported the matter to Col. Miles and the case was referred to His Highness who promised redress. Soon after thisgH.K.S.kifleman happened to arrive at Sur and the Sheikhs of the Jenebeh,apprehensivethat her arrival was connected with the outrage committed by their tribesmen,and ■ fearing the results,seized the offender and -^ould have doubtless caused restitution but H.11.S.Rifleman which only dropped anchor fpr a few hours incidentally in passing,having in the meantime weighed anchor,the Sheikhs perceived how matters .stood and released their tribesmen without further question. During H.H.Saiyid Turkic absence in O r adur,the case /rv was presented to Saiyid Abdul ^ziz but mthout beneficial result. About this time,the Sheikhs of tl oiic.^ -rent to the Banian and offered an arrangement promising no make good the loss in eight months. Thi arrangement they afterwards repudiated. Saiyid Turl reminded of the natter after his return,bat he -.v■'W.; 1 was not tie to put sufficient pressure on the .trite to cause then to make food the loss or to tring them to account for their misconduct,and they succeeded in procrastinating and delaying to reply until the season opened and they could get array in their tughlahs. H.H.finally informed Col. Hides that he left the natteri. in the hands o£ Government and as the latter considered the continued failure of tne Jenebeh tribe to cause restitution to a British subject plundered b^ them injurious to British interests,he supported H.H.s request that the enforcement of reparations might be undertaken by Government. To have held H.K. personally responsible for the loss sustained at the Jenebelis hands would /ia\e tended still further to weaken IT• H• s' authority and would have encouraged the predatory Arabs to continue tneir depredations on British subjects at E.b.s expense; whilst the exaction of reparation* from this tribe wouldion the other haocl xmalx. oe a cautionary wax'lling to all. Col. ** • E* ixcideauXj oh'. Po 1 i vica 1 Resident,also suggested that besides the original amount a fine of 0 2000 /r should be levied on the Jenebeh,_artly as compensation for the delay and partly as a pehaltyfor tue ooffense committed against a British subject. At first,however,the Government of India would not comply ^ith the Sultans reguest } claiming that the repression of crime and the punishment of criminals was the duty of the Sultan and that in return for the responsibility which it has incumeu. in guaranteeing to Saiyid Turki tne payment oi c±ie Zanzibar subsidy and for other material aid which had been afforded to Saiyid Turki from time to time. , 11 14By noun of the 25th, Jethanand* e claim amounting to dollars 1600/- had been satisfied, partly by a money payment, and partly by a bughlah, of which he had re ceived possession. At sunset the Governor of bur and Jethanand came on board. The former delivered to the p.A. dollars 2,000 and the latter stated that his claim against the J^nebeh had beer; fully satisfied. Government expressed satisfaction with the •results obtained and directed that the iine of dollars 2 ,000 sho'.ild be jr-aid to Bay: id Turki, after deducting the expenses incurred in the measures which had been taken. Xn 1866 Say y ids fey sal and Fahd rent to Sur to endeavour to obtain payment of certain customs duty from the Jenebeh but w^re unsuccessiul. Xn 1696, Suleiman bin Sureylim, rf ho was the Sultan’s ’•all of Bhofar, Sur, and Sohar, rent to Sur where the inhabitants were being encouraged by trench agency to make light of trie Sultan’s authority, he summoned the Sheikhs of hie .Toneben and informed tnem that in future he would not respect uha/ir, and would seize the persons and property of those who belonged to tribes whom he considered unfriendly, even ii in the house of the ’’Khafir” himself. When a party or caravan wish to pass through the country of another tribe, oiiey take with them as escort a mm belonging to the trioe through whose country they wish to pass. The party or caravan is then safe from attack, and vhis is k^o n as the *IGiafir” system. It is respected to such an extent that members of a tribe traveling under trie protection through the country of a tribe with which they even have a blood feud, are safe. This aroused the greatest indignation amongst the Jenebeh. Suleiman then proceeded to Muscat, leaving his son, a lad of 12 or 13 years, in charge of the place■ r^.ter he ”?rote to his son at Sur ordering hiia to build a fort at a spot which would at oncu conannd, both tht water supply of the town and the caravan route to the interior* Such a fort would have enabled the Sultan to overawe the Jenebeh and ensure a lar&amp;s increase in the revenue derived from the customs at Sur. About this time Sulei man ’s son threatened to shoot a gardener and actually did shoot a bullock and cut down a date tree belonging to him because the latter refused to supply him with some green grass, which he ^as keeping for his own camels. 4 ^ the four sections of the Jencben then combined and wrote letters to the Sultan asking him to stop the building of the fort and remove Suleiman’e son from Sur. The Sultan did not reply to these letters. Five of the Sheikhs then came to Muscat and placed their complaints before the Sultan but H.H. turned a deaf ear and they went away disappointed. f 1 At length, after'represents cions from several quarters, h.H, sent his writer Hamad to Sur to listen to the complaints of the Jenebch and stop- the building of the fort. No attention was paid by Suleiman’s son to this order, and on Hamad’s return H-H. did not even take the trouble to hear his report. Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim o l the mni bu u&gt;li no- intervened and induced the Sultan to stop the build ing of the fort, but the .Tcnebeh insisted on the recall of Suleiman’s son and said they were quite prepared to fight rather than submit to Suleiman's rule. The Jbnebeh then cut off the supplies of the garrison. The Sultan at once wrote to the Jenebeh warning them that their attitude,if persisted in,would only result in speedy and condign punishment. The Sultan’s messenger was informed by the Sheikhs that unless he loft Sur before nightfall,hi 8 blood would be a on his own head. lb '•p is p«FIt was difficult to .understand --diy the til tan persisted in trying to force Suleiman bin SurreyXin* s u; popular and high handed rule on the. Jeneoeh against their will. He had neither none;' nor troops ^ith which to coerce the tribe. Any man he could reaise would cone out not for the purpose of fighting but neiely to live at His Highness 1 s expense; whilst the Jencbeh, though not a martial tribe g^ere well armed and had sufficient money tp induce other tribes to join them. At length, towards the end of September,a force consisting of GOO Jeneboh ,00 0 Bani Bu ali and r50 Bani Rasib belaagured the fort occupied by the Sultan's pepresentative. -The rebels opened fire at long range and the garrison replied. This lasted for three hours without resulting in any loss for either side when it suddenly seemed to strike one of the Sheikhs that some members of his tribe ^ere in the fort. The Sheikh thereupon advanced up to the walls under a _la^ of .truce and called upon the garrison to surrender. X parley then ensued and an agreement was arrived at, the rebels guaranteeing that the Wall’s son and the belea-c ured garrison would be escorted in safety to the coast and placed on board a vessel bound .ior Muscat. The fort was accordingly evacuated and the party despatched to Muscat. Before returning to their homes,the rebels destroyed the ne- and half built fort referred to above. The Sheikhs wrote to the Sultan offering to hand ovei tnc fort to anyone' deputed by him except Suleiman bin Suweylim or his son and the Sultan despatched a, fi.esn garrison under Hamad bin Saif. The Sultan wrote a conciliatory letter to the Sheikhs informing them that he pardoned them for their late act oi rebellion but the Sheikhs,not convinced of his bona Tides, refused to alio- Hamad to take over the fort and he I 1 4® litreturned to Muscat. • ? At the end of the year,the Jenebeh ’'ere persuaded *0 a ne Tr * Mali and Sheikh Kvdiariraad din Hamad (the present Wali of Matrah and President of the Council.) and a fresh garrison of 60 men took possession of the fort. The fort was found to have keen entirely dismantled all the woodwork had been removed and nothing left but the bare walls. During this period,the authority ax the Sultan was being further undermined as a result of French intrigue. A plan of to harbour at Sur,published bp the French government in 1901,showed that their attention had been directed to that place at some earlier date and in 1893, M Chapui,a somewhat disreputable French subject arrived at Sur in a-steamer flying the French flag and tried to obtain a site for a coal shed there. The scheme for advancing French interests by a ^ide distribution of the .French flag was &amp;&amp;&amp; DG.lo.ly pursued. In Nov. 189! it Was st - ted that as many as 50 Sur boats flying the' French flag ’’’ere bound for Bushire and !8 had put in to Lingah. This question is further dealt T ~itn in the revie’' of the slave trade. By ! 900, the people of Sur, especially those of the Jenebeh tribe had almost ceased under French encouragement to regard the Sultan as their master. In ! 900 Hilal bin Inr arrived at Sur from fast Africa, joined hands ’with M. Ottavi, and began to inveigh against the Sultan and the British; and the spirit of_ the Jenebeh was such that, when' summoned by the Sultan to mee him at Muscat, they refused to go and insolently suggest ed that he should deal with them instead through the French tfice-Consul. It was this state of affairs which obliged Saiyid Faisal in June 1900 to make a visit to Sur the first since his accession. His reception as more favourable than he held expected; for all the elders ofof the town immediately paid.their respects to him, the chief Shaikh of the Bani bu Ali came do TTr n from the inte rior T,T ith a thousand men to do him honour, and the- Sul tan w as successful, before he left, in obtaining from the French flag holders of the port, including the Jenebeh, a formal profession of allegiance to himself and a renunci ation of French protection. In 1901 the Sultan sent 80 A^karis to garrison his post at Sur, and the -Tench flagholders, few of whom had observed their promise given in the previous year, understanding the act as a threat to themselves, osked L. Ottavi whether he ^ould protect them in case of an attack by the Sultan’s troops; his reply ^as unfavourable and the incident marked another sta^e in the decline of french inf 1 ..icnce Sur. ‘.bout 1915 c. blood fud started between the Arama and Kakhana sections of the Jenebeh ^hich has con tinued -ver since. In 1918 His Hijmess the ultan vis- ited Sur and fined the denebeh it 14, &gt;;-00 . nd imprisoned 26 bheiidns. this acuion in,p t the ; acfc for about two years. *n 1919 the lius cat customs were reorganized and the people of Sur, seeing that in future the dues would be more strictly enforced refused t,o alio- ^ cus- oOiiU. iiou-'.o w Ov; ouilt« Xii 1 s &gt;20 Captain liacColl l .u&lt;i, tlxo uneii -azir went to Sur in H.M.S. ’’Britomart” and the Jenebeh agreed to i Cu c c the j: ian ,t: .&gt;.11 ts. T a in:,s —ent smoothly for a short while and then smugglinp be pin again and has continued ever since. The customs house -as not built, difficulties being invariably placed in the ’wy, and the ./ali became as powerloS'S and inept as ever. w Spasmodic murderin 0 went .on, and, in 1955, the Council of ministers sent Sheikh Rashid, minister for Re ligious affairs, to attempt to put an end to the feuds. He returned having been openly flouted and having accom plished nothing. In July Zuba'ir, Finis ter of Justice,Justice, acconpani'id by Captain Alban and 150 levies and three machiae ’;uns, proceeded to 3 ur and occupied the fort. Auber reported that h,e had settled all feuds and caused blood money to be paid over immediately in his presence and recovered 6,400 dollars customs dues from the merchants and fined the tribe 4,000 dollars. A site T ^as selected for a custom house and the party returned to Muscat in triumph. Unfortunately there was one case in 'biich blood money T ~as not accepted. The Makhanah agreed to pardon the murderer, an Arama. He was imprisoned in Muscat but was released in 1924. Meeting an armed slave of the murdered Sheikh on the outskirts of Sur, he deci ded the man had been detailed to kill him and fired and killed the slave. This started indiscriminate firing between the sections in which one Araraa boy was killed. The Pu^aris took a hand and seized a water donkey belong ing to the Arama and a struggle ensued in which an Araraa girl w-xs killed. The Mali was able to use the Ramzan feast' for arranging a 45 days armistice. 70 About this time (1924) Mahomed bin j T a s e r, Am i r of the Bani bu Ali started to .take an interest in the affairs of the Jenebeh, having formed an alliance with Mansur bin Maser, Jenebeh Sheikh of Kasirah, and ^on over the Makhanah and A^l Ghialin sections in Sur - the weaker party in the feud among the Jenebeh - to acknowledge his authority. 7/ In 1925, Sheikh Mansur bin baser went to Sur, informed the Hindu community that there ^as no Sultan’s government in Sur, and that they ’'ere to look to him ior justice. He tried to form a committee of leading men for the administration of /justice as the ^local kali had oeen found incapable. The ./ali told the Hindus that new,as powerless and that they should inform tne British govern ment . 72- In 1927 Sheikh Mansur bin Maser of nasirahMasira^accompanied 'by Hamdan bin Kaser and Salim bin Naser, brothers of Mahomed bin laser of the Bani d a All stayed at Mecca for three months as the guests of His Majesty Ibn Saud. Mansur bin Naser died of small pox on the return journey.7? British efforts for the suppression of the slave tr.ule first took shape i»-l 822 by a treat* concluded ' r ith Saiyid Said of Kuscat, the object being the ex tinction of the slave trade between Africa and India. This t r e a ty rr a s. amp.l i f i e d in 18u8-o9. jinother agreement TT -s made 'in 1845. Again in 187. 7^/ The Resident '5 a ne^r treaty was made.

The hakhada of the vessel 1TT as imprisoned by tne bultan of Muscat and the vessel destroyed. Prom a description in the Times of India (Oct. 1872) of a slave vessel captured by the Vulture, the methods of the exporters appear to have been characterized by great baroarity. 'The number of slaves it was impossible at the time to estimate; so cfowded on deck and in the hold below was, the dhow, that it seemed, but for the aspect of misery, a very nest of ants. The hold, from which an intolerable stench proceeded, was several inches deep in tn-e viost foul bilge water and refuse. Down belo-g there -ere num bers of children in the most loathsome stages of small pox and scrofula of every description. A more disgustingand degrading spectacle of humanity could not he seen, while the foulness of the dhow ^as such that the sailors could hardly endure it. Whentthe slaves ere transferred to the Vulture the poor wretched creatures were so dread fully emaciated and weak, that many had to he carried on hoard and lifted for every movement. How it w as that so many survived such hardships was a wonder to all...But perhaps the most atrocious piece of cruelty of the Arabs was heard afterwards from the slaves themselves; viz. that at the first discovery of small-pox among them by the ^rahs, all the affected slaves were at once thrown overhoard, and this was continued day hy day until, they said, forty had perished in- this manner.” 7/ In : 873 H... . S. London was stationed at Zanzibar for ten years and during that period the wholesale traili •was for the time being suppressed. But slaves still arrived in the Persian Gulf 'ip small lots and dealers had begun to conceal their operations hy use of the French flag wgich secured them against search hy British vessels. In the eighties there was a recrudescence of the trade owing to the withdrawal of H.I'AS. London from, Zanzibar. 7 ^ Inquiry showed that slaves were brought to. Sur in vessels belonging to that p'ort, most of which flew French colours. The slaves were ordinarily landed at Sur itself but the owners of the vessels had accomplices at Ras el Hadd and other places, and when British cruisers appeared they received warning and landed them at small places nearby, whence the slaves were marched in gangs to Sur. The demand in the interior behind Sur is not pv great for the system of irrigation in Jaalan and Sharki- yah does not demand slave labour. The majority .of the slaves are re-exported in small vessels to the Batineh where irrigation is mostly from wells and mere some of them are retained. The balance is distributed from the 3a tineh to the Trucial coast by land. At this tine tne\ number imported here annually mas estimated at 300. The Jenebeh tribe proclaimed openly that their only object in .taking the French^ flag T ms to protect their slaving operations. 7*7 Sur ^.fickly attained a disreputable promin ence in the traffic and it became increasingly clear that the only - T ay to put an end to it ^as to break up the Sur depot; but the chief obstacle to such a step ~ r as the.attitude of France in regard to her flag. Political difficulties arose o^ing to the extent to which the pro tection of the French flag T ^as being abused. From 1 892 onwards abundant evidence T * r as forth coming of the abuse of the French flag by importers. In 1 896 several vessels carrying slaves '’-ere captured. In May the Political Agent captured a vessel carrying 28 slaves, A few days later H.I A S.lapsing captured a vessel carrying 14 slaves whilst the Sultan’s officials rescued t'~o recently imported slaves at bunder Jissah. HAAS. Sphinx captured two vessels flying the French flag. The one had 30 slaves on board; the other 140. A third ves sel whose ,French papers appeared to be in order was allow ed to/proceed.

The Sultan - s assured by the Government of India that his subjects could not oe re moved from his jurisdiction but the precariousness of his position at Sur and his fear of the French Government deterred him from taking any action. gj In 1900 Captain P.2.Cox re-examined the ques tion of the importation of slaves. T Ie found that aoout 1000 slaves had been imported tuat year into Sur, of T ' T hicn about half had been carried in vessels under the French fla, . In 1 901 about 1000 slaves ' r ere again imported whilst in 1902 the supp ly ''as stated to oe o',bunuant. In 1902, 114 Arabs w ere captured by the Portuguese in Mozambique whilst actually engaged in slave trading. About a third of them died in confinement while of the remainder 54 were sentenced to transportation for &lt;••• . wears. 7 ith a few exceptions these men belonged to the Jenebeh and 3ani bu Ali tribes of Sur. -he number of the captives -ho might have claimed French protection -as never ascertained but it -as admitted' by one of them before the Portuguese authorities that t-o of the vessels captured fie- the French flag. £3 In ^ -A Vue ' rd of t: TT u. p,c iribum -1 in -re avd to the French flag guebtion compelled the French authorities to exercise a closer supervision over native masters entitled to use the ‘French colours. i i' USince the sittlenent of the French Plaj (xuedition and the stoppa e of the principal sources of iupply at Zanzibar and on the i.frican eoasthvery little attention appears to have been paid to the traffic of slaves at Sur,but I an assured from several sources, that the trade both in slaves and in arris is very profitable and nearly every Arab dho^ arriving at Sur has a small quantity of these .commodities.i The slaves are being imported from 'A Socotra,Koka 1 la and Dhofar mhilst the arms come from Jeddah and the Italian ports in the Red Sea* r ! ,»• m in i# it: i If #1SUMKAriY Q-2 iEC^NT 1V1AT3 BT SUR, In 1927 , tile Ar:.ma and Makhana sections tf ts^W Jeneloeli .each built three new forts in their quarters ajainst the orders of the TVali.

It appeared to Mr Thomas that theeopposition to this came mainly from the Arama section and on leaving Sur,in the A1 Saeed,he took in tow an Arama sambuk which was in the harbour,whereupon the Arama fired on the AM Saeed. Beyond hitting the funnel and one of the ships boats,no damage was done. The fire was not returned. The Council fined tie Arama section Rs 1Q,000/- but have been unable to enforce this. ^ toyj&amp;rnsxl GLtir Aprilxi 92^4 / In April 1928 ,the Amirs of the Bani Bn Ali establish- ~ed a new customs x )0E ^ Aiqa. Their customs officer wrote to the state customs official at Sur demanding refund of customs which the state had levied on the grounds that the boat belonged to the Bani Bu Ali. The Amirs refused to furnish the Council’s representat ives with any explanation regarding this customs post, gr About the same time, the Bani*Bu Ali stopped a boat belonging to the Arama section from entering the ' creek whereupon the Arama preventsd a Bani Bu Ali boat |||] n|i ; If | y idfrom entering the creek. The Bani Bu Ali then ocfupied Balad As Sur ^ith a riew to commanding the water supply of Sur and obtaining mastery orer the town. On the 15th April, they were attacked in Balad As Sur by about 70 men of the Araraa and Fuwaris under the leadership of Sheikh Yaser al Majaala. The Arama lost six killed whilst the Bani Bu Ali lost ten killed and three wounded. Sheikh Rashid.Minister for Bhara,accompanied by Saiyid Shahab,brother of M.H. went to Sur on the 17th April to try and settle the dispute. Their reception by the Amirs was not cordial and they returned to Muscat on the 23rd April having failed to accomplish anything. However,through the inter- vention of other Sheikhs,the parties came to terms. The Arama and Makhana sections each destroyed one of their forts. All sections of the Jenebeh were to pay $ 20/- on each of their boats* to the Amirs for this year only and Sheilhs Yaser and Haser bin Mubarak were to call on the Amirs at Aiqa. On the 25th May,the Amirs worote to the Council of Ministers stating that their action had been taken on behalf of the Muscat State and demanding payment of % 10000/- expenses. They attempted to send this letter to the Council through the Political Agent but it was returned to them and they were informed that if they wished to communicate with the Council they should do so direct. In May,Abdulla bin Saleh.S.cr.tary to Hahom.d bin Baser .preceded to Bushire to interview the Political Resident. He asserted the Bani Bu Ali did not recognize the Sultan's authority and attempted to get a certificate of identity at the agency. He was directed to obtain a passport from the Sultan’s Government* In July 1928 .H.H. the Sultan and the Council ofMinisters furnished their views on the situation at Sur. They resented the letters and actions of the Amirs of Jaalan,realized they were not strong enough to deal with the situation.and asked for the assistance of the British Government. - , i-'t In August 1928,the Amirs wrote to the Political Agent claiming that Sur was a part of their territory,that the Sultans Wall was there and customs collected with their permission. That the town and customs were under their protection and everything would be accomplished in its proper time. On the 21st August,a party of about 15 Arabs chiefly of the Fuwaris section of the Jenebeh,boarded a Cutch Mandvi Buggalow belonging to a British subject - Khimji Ramdas $ which had arrived from Karachi,overawed the « C 2 ;ew with rifles and daggers andC made off with 22 bags bags of rice and Rs 200/- worth of personal property belonging to the Nakoda. Most of the culprits are k known. The Council of Ministers arrested one of them in Muscat and are attempting to obtain the surrender of the others from the Fuw&amp;ris Sheikhs . On the night of tie 27th August,some Arabs climbed over a broken wall and got into the fort where the Wall lives. They stabbed his two best horses. The Wall’s Askaris are believed to have had a hand in it in con- -junction with the Bani Bu Ali. They have been replaced by others from Muscat. The Mali’s telephone line from his residence to the customs is also being cut constantly iH^ih^i —' 1 i 111' ' ,r M i*-fry o tfttlo nod themru-lvcp n n t ^ loo-tedr-all people ^ning to -for _£LQ gua da-v-s«-£hey killed a number—e-f -donkeyor On the 18th September,a shop belonging to a Britishsubjoct - Kotimul SukkumuX - was broken into at noon by two men.

On the 2lst September, Abdulla bin Saleh,mentioned above,hoisted Ibn Baud*8 flag on the newly erected flagstaff. A salute of three guns was fired when the flag was hoisted and one gun when it was lowered in the evening. This appears to be a x^^silel to the action of Saiyid F&amp;dhl bin Alawi Moplah at Bhofar in 1875 when the 1 latter styled himself as Governor of Dhofar under the Ottoman Porte.

Said went to the ^ali and threatened him that if the Council did not release the man whoa they had arrested at Muscat in connection with the looting of the buggalow,he would commit further mischief. On the 26th September .Mahomed bin Naser wrote to the f Sur not to allow caravans to come to Sfrom Budlyah with dates.The ^ali refused to comply. He also wrote to trie Political Agent stating that his truce with the Hijriyin had been broken and asking him to warn British subjects not to d^al with the Hijriyin of Budiyah. He was asked not to interfere with the legitimate trade of British subjects. It would seem from the abore that the gang of Fuwaris were acting in conjunction with Mahomed bin Baser in stopping the Budiyah caravan. ^ It is believed that this action of the Amir is in new order to induce caravans to proceed to his/customs at Aiqa instead of Muqrimatain.

Beyond lowing a fe' , ’ T fines and possihly destroying a certain amount of property,the.result obtained is meagre.

He therefore ascribes a Phoenician origin to the place. The Mart of Mac eta ,% mentioned by Arrian in his account of the royaye of Nearchus,$ Hereen says, was probably Sur and he adds that an emporium like this, at the entrance of the gulf,strengthens ouridea of an ancient Indian trade with the Oman coast. At the time of Albuquerque, Sur is described as a small fishing village he passed whilst approaching Muscat . The Portuguese appear to hare occupied the place t^ice. The first period prior to 1633,when they were driven out by Maser bin Murshid al Yarraby. Again prior to 1648,when one of the conditions imposed bv the Arabs on the Portuguese was that the fort of Sur should be surrendered and razed.APPEND'IX WRECKS. * ' • In 1829,the Ban!

G.P.Badger,they are constantly being referred to as the Beni Temeem and not as the Bani Bu Ali. , z xhe Beni Temeem.one of the most considerable tribes in Arabia,ascribe their origin to Temim corn about A.D.120 - the son of Murr.a descendant of Madhar through Tabikhah and therefore of the race of Adnan and Maadd. They were dispersed over the North East of Nejd from-the Syrian desert to. the borders of the el Yamamah. Their territory comprised 13 H. the vast desert called Dahna.and extended on the south between the confines of A1 Yamamah and el Bahrein. The Bani Bu Ali are accounted the most religious tribe in the Oman Sultanate. They belong to lihe ¥/ahabi sect known as Agraqah and will not eat meat cooked by others. The founders of the Wahabi, Ibadhi. and lufuyyah sects all belonged to the Beni Temeem whilst the Harth.the other branch of the Bani Temeem . in Oman, have been the principal supporters of 'the «Ytrprae sect of the Ibadhis. ^ u MS , Yfts 0 the X, Mnali invasion of 1812-13, Salim bin Ali.Teraeeraah Sheikh o,f the Bani ^bu Ali,became their supporter, helping them against the Bani'bu Hassan, / / j tv 4 iIn In consequence of the part which Salim hin All had taken against the Bani Bu Hassan.there was a feud between the two tribes whic h resulted in a fis ht wherein Salim bin Ali and some of his people were killed; some of the Bani Bu Hassan also fell and as neither side would give in the war between them continued, and has been carried on more or less constantly ever since. Mahomed bin Ali.who succeeded Salim bin AH as Temeemah. seceded from the tenets of the Ibadiyah and adopted those of the Wahabi,throwing off the authority of the Imam. In 1820 .Saiyid Said having heard that Mahomed bin Ali had induced many of the inhabitants of Jaalan to adppt his creed,and that his followers among the A1 Ashkarah had plundered many Snglish ships wrecked there. applied to the English to aid him in an expedi -tion against Mahomed bin Ali and his confederates. The Bani Bu Ali murdered the messenger carrying a .etter to the Chiefs from the British party investig- ■ating reports of piracy near Has el Had. Captain Chompson, in charge of operations, decided to avenge the act and with a small force consisting of six companies.sailed to Muscat where plans were made for the Sultan to reinforce him at Mur. The combined force marched on Balad Bani Bu Ali.the capital of the tribe. bu t proved entirely inadequate and after attempting to take the town.were sharply repulsed.

The number of slain on each side being equal,each party forgave the other ;and as regards wounded (About 70 in number) the blood money was determined by Mahomedan 2aw. ?&lt;£. In 1874,Bani Bu Ali of the Jaafarah section bel- -onging to Lashkharah were responsible for the wrongful confinement and subsequent release on ransom of subjects of the Rao of Cutch at Hellanujah island.

His eldest son Baser had predeceased him and as the latters son Mahomed was still a minor.Abdullas second son Ali was made Amir Jointly with Mahomed bin Baser. An arrangement which still continues. During the 1913-19 rebellion,the Bani Bu Ali.took the part of the Sultan but their behaviour was not altogether satisfactory. They sent the rice^iven them for their progress inland to their homes at Bur and also left behind the ammunition with which the Sultan had provided them,at Muscat for taking to their homes at the first convenient opportunity and then on their arn- -val at Sib,we re demanding extra supplies of both food and ammunition.

In 1920 the Wazir cut tne allowances paid to the Bani Bn Ali through misdirected economy' but Mr Wingate restored them. In 1925 # the Amirs sent a petition to Guvernmen claiming that the port of Sur belonged to them and that the Sultan had nothin^ to do with the said port; that the Sultan did not supply them with armc and ammunition according to agreement and asking that . they might enter into direct relations with the Government of India. Government replied that they were unable to intervene on their behalf. ' This claim to independence on tne part of tne Amirs of Jaalan appears to be based on the compact entered into by the Wahabi Sheikh on his invasion of Oman when certain Sheikhs jfaKaxo^xAhBocaasiodtoxAii. were constituted Ameers or territorial lords in their own right. without any dependence on Muscat.

In 1900 Captain P.Z.Cox re-examined the ques tion of the importation of slaves.

Since the settlement of the French Flag ciuesffaon and the stoppage of the principal sources of Supply at Zanzibar and on the African coast.very little attention appears to have been paid to the traffic of slaves at Sur.but I am assured from several sources that the trade both in slaves and in arms is very profitable and nearly every Arab dhow arriving at Sur has a small quantity of these commodities. The slaves are being imported from Socotra.Moka.ua and Dhofar whilst the arms come from Jeddah and the Italian ports in the Red Sea. /UrJr Uflrni*, ^ U~ U^c-fMr f s/iUU- U- SAJ. ^ Jr ^ , JT . a. f' /'} ; ' \*C\SOTMARY OF RECENT EVENTS IN SUR* In 1927.the Aram and Makhana sections of the Jeneheh each built three new forts in their quarters ' against the orders of the Wall.

In 1895,the British Government extended to Saiyid Faisal the guarantee given to his Father that tney would not allow attacks to be made upon Muscat and Mat rah whatever differences the Sultan might, nave with his tribes, In actual practice,this guarantee was extended to u.11 the ports of the Batinah coast and th Kuryat at which British subjects were residing and in 1896,an offer was made by the British Government and finally accepted by the Sultan of naval assistance ^he V recovery of Bhofar. If assistance is to be afforded,the question arises as to what form such assistance shall take and I venture to put forward the following remarks on the question. It seems hardly lively that at the stage ” Tillch has now been reached,Mahomed hin Naser would he devi- -ated from his purpose hy moral pressure alone. His attitude will probably be that of the Jenebeh in 1865. 'We have been threatened before. Nothing has happened. We are quite sure nothing will happen now.* It was suggested last year that economic pressure could be brought on the inhabitants of Sur by preve* nting Sheir dhows from trading in British ports. This was the policy attempted by Napoleon against England. It failed then; 1 doubt whether it would succeed in the present instance. Naval action has been taken at Sur before as has been noted in the Historical Summary of the Jenebeh The presence of a man of war would appear to have a g ood moral effect at the time but its influence seems to depatt as soon as it has steamed aut of sight.andIf the administration of Sur is to be brought to that state of efficiency ^hich its importance as a trade emporium demands,if the slave trade and arms traffic are to be stopped and if effective protection is to be afforded to British subjects trading at Sur instead of allowing them to be xtasi# driven out,it would seem necessary to follow the same co :rse as in the case of Muscat and Matrah. These towns have been transformed from armed camps living constantly under the threat of raids,into peaceful and law abiding places as quiet and safe as any to^n in India. The ^result has been reached by gradual t./nn . Indian troops were landed in 9^* b during the rebellion of Sheikh Isa bin Saleh an d the Imam of Tanuf for the protection of Muscat and Matrah in accordance with our undertaking to defend these townd. After one attack in 1915,when he sustained a severe defeat*Sheikh Isa bin Saleh left these places severely alone. After the Sultan had come to terns with the Imam,a email levy corps under a British officer was formed and paid fox* by the Muscat Government,and the Indian troops were able to depart. This corps,though very weak numerically,is a constant reminder to the tribestkh&amp;t they cannot raid the place with impunity and their presence is sufficient to restrain any lawless elements there my be in the population. 3y stationing a Battalion of Indian Infantry at Sur for a year or two,the same result could presumably be achieved. The state could undertake to build a proper customs house and establish an effective adminis- -tration there. Increased customs revenues could he utilized for the increase of the strength ofthe Muscat Infantry hy a hundred men,eventually h^&gt; IL to tak® the place of the Indian troops as soon ac the situation he cones sufficiently stabilised. The cost of such a force has been worked out for me in detail by Captain walker'* Commandant, Muscat Infantry but I have not thought it :eccssary to include such details in this •©port.
