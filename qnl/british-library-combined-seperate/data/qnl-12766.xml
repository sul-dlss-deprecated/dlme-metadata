Subjects discussed include the deposition of the Gaekwar of Baroda; the Indian frontier and policy towards it; and Pelly's ailing health which eventually forces him to return to England in 1875.Pelly subsequently returns to India, accompanying Lord Lytton on a negotiating mission with the Amir of Afghanistan, and the correspondence from this period consists primarily of instructions to Pelly in regard to the negotiations.Other correspondents include journalists for the
                           Pall Mall Gazette,
                           Daily Telegraph, and
                           Manchester Guardianas Pelly had numerous letters and articles published in newspapers following his return to England in 1877; correspondence with George Christopher Molesworth Birdwood on both Indian affairs and publishing matters; and correspondence with Lord Lytton, the Marquess of Salisbury (Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury) and Lord Derby (Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby) 1878-1883 in which he attempts to secure employment either in India or with the India Office in London.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>1st Earl of Lytton Edward Robert Bulwer- Lytton</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>1st Earl of Northbrook Thomas George Baring</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>3rd Marquess of Salisbury Robert Arthur Talbot Cecil Gascoyne-</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Amy Henrietta Pelly</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Afghanistan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Rajputana</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Baroda State</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001524.0x000392#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001524.0x000392#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001524.0x000392#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001524.0x000392#share">Non-commercial use only</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001524.0x000392#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001524.0x000392#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
