The accommodation required will consist of one room for the observatory and saj tv.'o rooms for each of the observers. ,.ould you very kindly let ae know whether suitable accommoda tion can be rented for the purpose. As far as possible, it is desired that the living accoiimodation for the 'observers and the observatory should be near together, if not in one and the same building, ana also near the telegraph office. Moreover, tne observatory should be located on an open plot of ground, where hydrogen-filled balloons can be let off and observed without hindrance from any surrounding obstacles such as trees or higbjuuildings. 1 shall therefore be greatly obliged if you will very kindly let me know 'whether it will be possible to obtain on rent accoiamodation of tne kind mentioned above or whetner it v;ill be better to locate 1 the observatory in your office and arrange for the accomaodation of observers in any other avai lable place, iindly send me your suggestions with the likely 4 amount of rent that will have to be paid in each case, and then if necessary, I snail arrange to send the Insxiector of Observa- P &gt;&gt; 1 - r l\ * 1 tytories, who is sliortly proceeding -on tour towards the Persian Gulf. 1 have the honour to be.

Karachi, the 26 August, 19 0 7. Dear Sir, I am grateful to you for the valuable infor mation contained in your letter I n o.62.0 of 1927, dated the 26th July, 1927, on the subject of an observatory at 3ahre in. The observatory at Bahrein is for the present being started as an experimental measure in connection with the expected airship and aeroplane service from England to India, in order to collect authentic meteorole- gical information. After the data collected during a year is studied the suitability of the place as an obser vatory will be determined. You will therefore see that at this stage it is not possible to spend money on perma nent buildings. If however it is decided at the end of a year to locate an observatory at Bahrein permanently, I shall again ask for your help for a suitable site and necessary buildings. As matters now stand, the Air Mini's try expect a mete-orological station to be started at Bahrein as early as possible so* that at least a year's data are available before the airships start on the experimental flight towards the east. I am therefore arranging to recruit and train necessary personnel for the ooservatory with a view to sending them afe soon as possible to Bahrein. As we are all interested in the early estab lishment of air services between England and India, I request you to be good enough to help us by allotting, i possible, a small room or a shed, as a temporary measure, for keeping observatory equipment in your agency buildingsand also to help the two observers in securing suitable accoramodation on as small a rent as possible* The two observers will probaoly reacn oanrein by about the middle of October* Yours faithfully, Meteorologi From Dr. B.

Uett your Ho.375^of 1929dated the 24-4~29. The observers have just sent me all the papers ragarding the auestion of shifting of observatory from its present site. As they have not sent me your proposals for an alternative site I wish to make the following observations for your consideration. Paring my inspection of the observatory at Bahrein 1 had a look round the neighbourhood of the Wireless 1 IGe kad also a talk with you on the subject of a suitable site for the observatory. I have now arranged, to shift some of the instruments for surface observations by arrangement with the Director, Indo-European Telegraphs to the Wireless building. I could not however arrange to shxit the upper air observatory to the same place as the wireless masts will considerably obstruct the pilot balloon work. The observatory at Bahrein unlike most of the stations sends up hydrogen filled pilot balloons for measurements of Upper air velocity and. direction. To these pilot balloons tails, 100 metres (roughly 300 feet) in length are attached for determination of balloon heights. IThen bhe balloon is let off from the ground it rises vertically and at tne same time drifts horizontally according to the strength and direction of tne wind, if there are oostaclea near the place whence these pilot balloons -re sent up, the tails will get entangled and make the obser vations impossible, it is therefore essential to have a free space of roughly 150 feet radius to ensure reasonable percentage of successes with pilot balloon work.K W ik 'With strong ground, winds this space will of course 'be insufficient. Since the inauguration of the airmail service it has 'become absolutely essential to get ^he ohser- vations as quickly as possible at this forecasting office. 3he present site is very near the wireless station and if any other site is found which is not as near it will constitute a real disadvantage. 1 request you therefore to very kindly sonsider the above reasons aM send me your suggestions in the matter. If at a later date Government sanctions the errections of pucca 'bmilding for the observatory, tne present site for the buildings will be ideal.b .O.

But Mr. Ishaq All Khan . the observer in charge brought the whole case to the notice of the Political Agent and also deposited two months house rent with him. luchd. Haji having gone to Persia and the owner of the' house j not wishing to bring eny case against him, it was decided by the magistrate tliat the house rent shoald oe paid to the real owner and not to any of his agents. He beins: a big trader is al-avs busy and also does not care much for the house rent that ! se should come ounctually to receive it. Tnis fact ir a.s also stated to the Head Clerk of the Political Agsnt who said that the house rent may remain with the observer in charge excepting two months house rent t'at was already in the Political Agents office and added that whenever the owner comes to have the house rent it may be paid together to him.

A scale of fe.20-1-30 plus a compensatory allowance of Rs. 10/- would probably be sufficient to obtain men at the moment as there is a slump in the pearl trade with the result ihat many men are out of employment. When the pearl trade is flourishing, a cooly gets Rs.2/- a day.

BAHREIH 16th SEPTEMBER 1933 The Political Agent, Bahrein. Dear Sir, We would advise that it is customary to obtain leather Reports twice daily from the Meteorological Observer at this port for transmission to Air headquarters Baghdad, in order that they can compile a Weather Beport for the Mear East and Persian Gulf air route section. This Weather Keport is supplied not only to K .A.I?.Machines hut other Civil Machines flying through the above mentioned air route. It is therefore necessary for these reports to be submitted to Baghdad at a time when all othei reporto from other sections are submitted t&amp; them. Sor the collection of the leather seport at this Station, imperial Airwaye employ a Cyclist Peon,who presents himself at the Meteorological Uffioe a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before time, on many occasions the Peon has mentioned to us .that these reports are never ready on time, which is 7-45 a.m for the morning ohservations. if they are handed to him after time, the time of Qeuc, au M.' fa &amp; •;- 2 - ■ issue is still shown as 7-45 a.m and we attribute tlie delay in receiving the message to negligence on the part of the .reon* in order that the Peon should not 'be held responsible for these delays, we have instructed him to see that the time of issue is correctly shown on the reports. This morning the report was issued to him a few minutes after 8 0*clock 'but the time of issue was still shown as 7-45 a.m. On requesting the observer to correct the time of issue, our Peon reports that he was abused and beaten with a stick and driven out of the observer's Office. We sent the .Feon to be examined by Doctor Holmes and attach hereto his report on the examination. We regret to trouble you on this matter but shall be obliged if you will investigate the trouble as only your authority will put the matter right if the Observer is at fault. We understand the Observer's Peon was a witness to the incident. We quite realise that on days when the weather is unsettled as it is today^ some observations are difficult to record and it might be necessary to take them again in order to verify their accuracy. This work no doubt delays the issuing of reports but should not prevent the Observer from stating the correct time of delivery or making unnecessary fuss and trouble when asked to state correct time of issue.

The Air fflbservers have been complaining to the Baladeyah since last year upto now about the rubbish which the people throw on the land of the Air Observatory situat ed near the telegraph office. The Baladeyah is reporting these complaints to you with a view that you will be kind enough to warn the watch men who patrol in the quarters day and night to attend to this matter and to arrest anyone who does soCthrows rubbishj in the station(Air Observatory)or in the lanes and streets. A letter dated 16th August 1933 has come to the Baladeyah from the said Air Observers in which they still complain apparently on account of the carelessness of the watchmen in this matter.

The file begins with a letter from the head meteorologist of the India Meteorological Department in Karachi, addressed to the Political Agent (20 June 1927), stating that the Government of India, in conjunction with the London-Karachi Aviation Weather Service, wish to start an Upper Air Observatory at Bahrain (f 1). The Agent, liaising with the British Adviser to the Bahrain Government (Charles Belgrave) confirms that land adjacent to the existing telegraph office is available. He confirms that accommodation for the two weather observers is available in town (f 3).Correspondence throughout the remainder of the file relates to the ongoing maintenance and running of the observatory. A number of themes are repeated through the file, which can be summarised as follows: the rent of land and buildings for the observatory, and accommodation for the observers; arrangements for the delivery of equipment and correspondence from India, and duty to be paid at the Bahrain customs house; medical requirements of and health checks for the observatory staff; periodic repairs to the observatory premises; damage to and theft of observatory equipment; misuse and appropriation of observatory land; proposals to erect fencing around observatory land; recruitment of local labour to manufacture weather balloons.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Upper Air Observatory, Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>RAF Air Liaison Officer, Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Meteorology</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0001a8#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
