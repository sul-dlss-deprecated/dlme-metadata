It was published by order of Jean-Frédéric Phélypeaux, Count de Maurepas (1701-81), secretary of state under King Louis XV. The map focuses exclusively on the coastlines, and provides no detail about the interior of the Arabian Peninsula. It shows pearl banks along the coast from Bahrain to Julfar. Qatar is noted (“Katara”), but the peninsula that it occupies is not accurately drawn. Kuwait is not shown, but the island of “Peleche” is indicated. The Red Sea is indicated as Mer Rouge ou Golfe d’Arabie (the Red Sea or the Gulf of Arabia). The note at upper right explains the use of three different symbols: a star to indicate places whose locations had been determined by astronomical observations of latitude and longitude; a cross to indicate places whose locations had been determined by astronomical observations of (only) latitude; and a modified cross to indicate places whose locations had been determined by latitudinal observations made by skilled navigators.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Arabian Peninsula</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>United Arab Emirates</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Arabian Gulf</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Persian Gulf</topic></subject><subject><geographic>Yemen</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/qnlhc/2918#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
