With reference to my despatch of the 25th November last, I have the honour to enclose herewith the Report of the discussion raised in the Chamber of Deputies by M. Francois Deloncle on the Foreign Office estimates in order to obtain the establishment of a Vice-Consulate at Muscat. M. Deloncle stated that he considered it to be incumbent on the obliga tions and honour of France to have a Consular Agent of some kind there to keep a register of French protected subjects, adding that of late years Eussian influence had begun to make headway against that of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf, and that his proposal would be a proof of the combined action of France with the great nation which is her ally. The Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that the matter was under consi deration, and that he hoped in a short time to be able to satisfy M. Deloncle in this matter. The Chamber appeared satisfied with this statement and de clined to adopt M. Deloncle's amendment to add 7,000 francs to the vote for the special creation of the Vice-Consulate in question. M. le president. ' Chap. 4. —Traitement des agents diplomatiques et consulaires, 6,493,700 fr. ' II y a sur ce chapitre un amendement de M.

D.*eopy of letter No.86 dated 7th March 1903 from the Political Agent Muscat to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. 1. In view of the fact that the season for the annual sojourn of the French Consul and French men-of-war at Soor is drawing near, and that His Excellency the Viceroy will shortly be going on tour I venture to make another reference to Grovernment on the subject of the French Flag in Oman. 2. It is close upon a year now since the Marquess of Lansdowne held the conversations with the French Ambassador mentioned in His Lordship's despatches of 16th and 255rd April last to the address of Sir E.Monson, and I would remind the Grovernment of India in this regard that Monsieur Cambon has now been fencing with this question at the London Foreign Of fice for three years, and that nothing practical has resulted \ , from the informal expression of his views and promises except that postponement of the issue which it is the express object and advantage of the Government of the Republic to effect and maintain. Meanwhile the relations between the Sultan and his Soori sub jects, which two years ago had improved considerably in the desired direction, are, as was to be expected, drifting grad ually backwards; the reason being that the long delay in the negociations since the question was taken up by His Majesty's Foreign Office and the absence of any patent result during the years which have since elapsed is unintelligible to His Highness, or worse still, interpreted by him to portend that the British Q-overnment are not in a position to see him through 1 S this difficulty by putting any presure on the French Govern- A ment. On the other hand, the Soori Community knowing that the ques tion of their French papers was specifically raised three yearsyears ago and that, in the interval there has been no result affecting them, while French ships and the French Consul sojourn with them and encourage them as here^pfore, must be expected to increase towards in their disaffection the- Sultan. I have reason to believe that it is only the imprisonment of a large number of them and the death of not a few at Mozambique 12 months ago that has given them something else to think of during the past year and kept them from being actively hostile to the Sultan. Lastly, as I have before pointed out, whereas when the matter had not gone beyond the local officers I was able to do a good deal locally to support the Sultan's position, since His Majes ty's Grovernment have taken it up my hands have been tied, and I have been oilliged to desist from personal activity in the mat ter for fear of vitiating negociations which may possibly be going on at home. This again has been interpreted to our detri ment. 3. In view of the above considerations, and with our pre sent position strengthened by the Mozambique and Somali Coast captures of Oman dhows, I trust that the Government of India will feel warranted in again pressing upon His Majesty's Foreign Office the importance of a speedy settlement of the question with the French Government and the undesirable 'extent to which our interests and influence are suffering here by the delay of\ . • Received with letter from the Secretary, Political Department, India Office, No. 47, dated the 24th October 1902, India Office, I7tli October 1902. Sir, I am directed by Lord George Hamilton to enclose, for Lord Lansdowne's information, a copy of papers received from India with reference to the reported capture by the Portguese authorities in Mozambique of a number of Arab slave- dealers. It appears that some of these dealers at least belonged to Oman; and it would, in Lord George Hamilton's opinion, be desirable to obtain, if possible, from the Portuguese Government a detailed narrative of the occurrence referred to giving full information as to the names, fathers' names, and tribes of the Arabs killed and captured, with a view to their identification.

Sir, I am directed by Lord George Hamilton to forward herewith, for Lord Lansdowne's consideration, with reference to the despatches to His Majesty's Ambassador at Paris, Nos. 159 of the 16th April and 171 of the 23rd April last, a copy of a letter from the Government of India, No. 184 j , Secret, dated 9th October 1902, and enclosures, transmitting copies of further papers regarding the use of the Erench flag by subjects of the Sultan of Maskat. Lord Lansdowne will observe that the Sultan of Maskat has informed the British Consul of two recent cases in which the Erench flag has been issued to His Highness's subjects at Sur. In the absence of any authentic list of persons who were in the month of June 1900 in possession of Erench papers of protec tion and considered to be entitled to the use of the Erench flag, it is impossible to say positively that cases such as these now reported are not cases of the renewal of papers previously issued. In the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs of his letter of the 20th September last (No. 420), Major Cox points out how the under taking of 1900 can be evaded, unless the re-issue of papers is strictly limited to the persons who possessed them at the time of the issue of the Sultan's Edict of June 1900. Lord George Hamilton trusts, therefore, that Lord Lansdowne will take an opportunity to remind the Erench Government of the necessity of furnishing the list suggested in the memorandum of the 16th April last; and of instructing their Consuls in the Hed Sea ports and elsewhere to limit the issue of papers of protection to those persons who were legitimately entitled to them at the date of the Sultan of Maskat's Edict in June 1900.

H.B.M.'S QONSUL ^ POLITICAL AGENT: Dated Muscat 11th April 190J5. SIR, In continuation of my telegram dated 10th in- stant / stating that the question of the French Flag in Oman had Just been acutely raised, I have the honor to report the circumstances thereof in detail. 2, It is necessary in the first place to go brief ly into tribal politics in order that the .Government of India may be acquainted with the exact position. .The tribes of Oman are divided into two great racial divi sions, jGhafiri and Hinawi. .Tribes of both divisions are set- ijx/ tied indiscrimately in the vicinity of one another through- /V out the country but their interests and organisation are dis tinct and some sections of the one division are almost in variably at war with sections of the other. Soor is inhabited by Ghafiris,primarily of the tribe of Beni- Abu-Ali subject to whom are another Ghafiri tribe, thef Jenne- beh. Most of the French Flagholders are recruited from the Jennebeh sub-tribe, but some also from the main tribe of the Beni-Abu-Ali. Shaikh Abdulla bin Salim of the Beni-Abu-Ali is the head ShaikhShaikh of all the Beni-Abu-Ali, calls himself the Ghafiri 'Amir' anc^ apacBt from the more remote sovereignty of the Ruler of Oman which Shaikh Abdulla loyally acknowledges^the latter holds ab solute practical sway over all the Xxhafiri tribes of that patt of Oman, which is known as the district of'Jaalan'. (S©e map Enclosure No.9.)• Shaikh Abdulla who is a very old man, and his bedouin followers, ( us opposed to the seagoing population of Soor) ever since the time when they were defeated by a British force, in March 1821, have always been good friends to the British. Shaikh Abdulla is well known to me, has repeatedly invited me to come and stay with him at his home, about 70 miles inland of Soor, and two years ago'when Dr: von Kraft and I were held up by the Hl»awi while' endeavouring to get to the coal bearing country, offered to' muster his entire following and[ forcibly introduce us into the coal bearing tract from the south side. It was Shaikh Abdulla also who, in June 1900, came into Soor with 1000 armed followers to greet the Sultan, and afterwards so materially assisted His Highness in obtaining from the French flagholders the written undertaking which they afterwards broke. 5, For some we^ks past active hostilities have been go- ■ ing on between the Ohafiris under Abdulla bin Salim and the Hinawi tribes of the district, especially a tribe called the Hijrieen. Now the poorer part of the populace of Soor partly make their livelihood by transporting rice and other provisions to the villages of the hinterland / not only Grhafiri but also Hinawi, when there is no war and also at other timas so long as the risk is not too great; but Abdulla bin Salim not being able to terminate current hostrilities and bloodshed by other means, and becoming'incensed at his fellow tribesmen of Soor continuing to supply his enemies with provisions came down to Soor about 16th March with a force of 5oo armed men camped in the Eigeh quarter of Soor (vide sketch map^accompanying) and' f proceeded to hold all the road^'leading tc the interior, until such tiifie as he could obtain satisfactory assurances from the- ! eldersA / r' .elders of the port, 'that; 'they would cease to allow their trans- Y port to take provisions his enemi^d. Shaikh Abdulla at ■ . :? &amp; ^ i.' ■. .c. ■ * .5* ■ &gt; the seune time wrote to the Sultan asking him to come down and help him arrange the affair, but at the moment no ship was C available for the Journey and 10 days later when the Resident kindly undertook to d&amp;op |&amp;s ftighness there in the 'Lawrence' if he could find his own way back he thought it.jroul^ be too • late to be of use and that in the meanwhile the matter would have adjusted itself. In fact, that was the news which he re ceived from Soor. Subsequently the Shaikh wrote to me also, complaining that the Banyan community were assisting his ene mies by sending provisiohS' to their villages and asking me to put a stop to it. His letter and my reply form enclosures Nos.7 and 8. The details of what passed between Shaikh Abdulla . N and the el ders of Soor will be founci in the news-letter sent to me by a confidential agent at Soor (Enclosure No.1) from which it appears that the dhow owned by one Mubarak bin Hamed, which carries Prench papers made out in t he name of his son and not himself , was lying in the creek behind Soor and was ready to go to sea.. The owner fearing that^ie might be forced to subscribe to the money payment demanded by Abdulla bin Salim and that if he refused his dhow might be detained, ordered the French flag to be run up and endeavoured to run the gaunt let past Shaikh Abdulla's camp out of the creek. The position will be quite clear from a reference to the map. After due warning the dhow was fired, at. It seems unnecessary to go into the ethics of Shaikh Abdulla's proceedings which were clearly the result ^of ordinary inter-tribal complications pe culiar to the conditions of life in Oman. The main point is that the man Mubarak bin Hamed made ^tse of the French flag in the territorial limits of Soor in order to evade his tri bal obligations. His son Khamis bin Mubarak hurried to Mus cat as soon as he could get away and laid his complaint be fore Monsieur Dorville, the new French Consul who relieved MonsieurMonsieur Laronce three weeks ago. According to the statement of an informant who is generally reliable Monsieur Dorville was at first disinclined to take u^ the matter, biitthe flag-*- holder said that he woulji return h^s papers if he was not sup ported ^whereupon Monsieur Dorville sent for Goguye^and after consulting him^addressed to the Sultan the letter a copy of which forms.enclosure.No.2. His Highness the Sultan forwarded his letter to me and also a copy oi* 'his own reply thereto, al so attached. My own protest. Monsieur Dorville's reply and my final rejoin der (Nos.4 6 &amp; 6) explain themselves. 4, Just as I am conduding this letter His Highness sends me a further letter which he has received from the French Consul demanding compensation in the^um of 1,500 dollars for the detention of the dhow and saying that be is referring the question of the damaged flag to his Government. The second incident I am reporting in a separate letter for facility of record. I have the hon^r to be, ■ SIR, ■ * JO ^ ■ ♦our most obedient servant, Sd.

The women'seeing the men started shouting whereupon a number of Sooris rushed out with their rifles to * f' - * . t.- ^ - Sikaikera and fired off some shots. On hearing this some hundred men belonging to Abdulla bin Salim sallied out to meet the Sooris,but four of th^ Soori elders thereupon came upon the scene and settled the matter. After this the Sooris kept a guard night and day in Sikaikera as they feared that Abdulla bin Salim would prevent the Sooris from going there for water. 82nd March ; About IJS Sooris went to visit Abdulla bin Salim among them being Shaikhs Mahomed bin Mubarak and Nasir bin Mahomed Gelani. When they approached the encampment Abdulla bin Salim sent word by his slave to say that only Shaikhs Ma homed bin Mubarak and Nasir bin Mahomed should come in and that he had no concern with the rest. The two Shaikhs above mentioned visited Abdulla bin Salim whom they interviewed. Abdulla bin Salim told them to stop supplying all provisions to the frljrieen and also forbade them to ship or bring any thing for them in their Buggalows, or to warehouse their goods Finally it was settled, after a deal of discussion, that as the present season was oVer nothing could be done now but that • it ' for the coming season the Sooris would respect the wishes of Abdulla bin Salim. esrd March ; 'Nothing transpired. tk March ; Shaifch Mahomed bin Mubarak sent 100 dollars to ' AbdullaAbdulla bin galim for the expenses of his followers and trans port animals^ which Abdulla bin Sa^im accepted. 86th March : Abdulla bin Salim sent word to Mahomed bin Muba rak that he could not accept the 100'dollars but that he want ed 800 failing which relations wou^d be broken off* the Khor ( Soor creek}' would be closed and : no boat would be allowed 5 to i enter ,or leave it. The SooriS irQp^le;d that - the four local tri bal sections would consider the master and send a definite re ply the next day.. The 100 dollars sent to Abdulla bin Sali?n were only subscribed by two men, the general public knowing nothing about it but when the dollars were returned every body came to know what had transpired. Of the 1G0 : dollars 50 were paid by Mahomed bin Mubarak and 50 .by. .Nasir bin Mahomed, At night representatives of the four sections met and discussed the question,. All save-Mahome(i bin Mubarak and Nasir-bin Ma homed said that they would not pay Abdulla bin £alim a pice,' but this was all bravado as they were from all^..accounts fright ened of Abdulla bin Salim. and .onlst made a pretence of refusal, ■ t £ ■:~-V ' The only ones really against payment were Abdulla bin Khamis ; &gt;'r 'V'^ :* &gt;•• T' ' r - ■' Musallim and Salim bin Mussalim of the Mukanneh section (French flagholders,.) Ali bin Saeed of the same tribe- however declared- his willingness to pay for the whole section and paid 50 dol lars, the reason being that he has a new bugla and was fright-^ ■ • ' &gt; '■ j - v •' • - ' ■ ened lest, in the.event of things going wrong, his bugla would be destroyed. Of the remaining 50 dollars the Xxhelani tribe paid half and the Arama the rest. The 800 dollars were thus collected, 86th March: There was a bugla belonging to a man owning French papers, in the Khor, It was about to start for Bombay and be— ^ longs to Mubarak bin Hamed Razeki, The papers are made out however in the name of Khamis bin Mubarak, his son. The owner of the bugla not being aware that the 800 dollars demanded by Abdulla bin Salim had been subscribed ordered his Khallasies to hoist the French flag over his bugla. The Khallasies were running up the flag when one of Abdulla bin Salim's men shouted outout to them from a neighbouring not to hoist it, they replied A that they had their master's orders and ran it up. Then Ab- dulla bin Salim's man fired two shots at the flag one of which took .effect and rent the flag. It remained up however all the day. The owner of the bugla said he would go to Muscat and ref&gt;ort the matter to the French Consul. Mahomed bin Mu barak advised him not to do so as ther6 was nothing to be gained by-going to Muscat and promised'to consider the matter the next day. « The BOO dollars were sent to Abdul'la bin Salim but no answer ' was received from 5 him as to whether he accepted the amount or not. Mahomed bin Mubarak's bugla came in today but could not enter the Khor as Abdulla bin Salim's permission had not been ob tained. At night word came from Abdulla bin Salim to the ef fect that he did not accept the '800 dollars and that only Ma homed bin Mubarak* s bugla could come in but no other. 87th March: The VITali of Soor, Hamood bin Hamed, came in from Bilad and advised the Soqris to give Abdulla bin Salim 590 dollars and three bags rice. The'Sooris agreed and word was sent to Abdulla bin Salim but nothing has been heard from him. Abdulla bin Salim has sent for Shaikhs Mahomed bin Mubarak and Nasir bin Mahomed. No further news. The owner of the bugla which was fired at has now left for Muscat to lay his cas.e before the French Consul.-1^7— Translation of an Arabic letter addressed to His Highness the Sultan by Monsieur C.DorVllle Vice Consul for France at Mus cat dated 6th April 1903^ After the usual compliments.

In it you inform me regarding the interference by Abdulla bin Salim A1 Hamoodeh with the bugalow belonging to Mubarak bin &gt; ^ ^ Hamed Razaiki in which there was a French Flag. In this con nection your honor is aw^re that the question of the French Flag in my territories is under discussion between the ^reat Governments of France and Britain, the two powers pledged from of old tcjpreserve my independence. It is not hidden from you that the main land of poor and its creek are part and parcel of my territory and territorial waters, and it is impossible that I can admit that the French flag has rights within it as V ''f I intimated to you in my letter dated 9th Shawwal 1317. And it is well known that the tribes of Oman are turbulent^, and ^ fighting always rife among them, how therefore can the French flag (be permitted to) enter into the internal affairs of my country which concern no one? but my-self ? And if your honor will consider the matter you will see that what I say is right. ■ Then again you quote the name of the man abovementioned as possessi^ the right to fly the French flag, but I am quite &gt; A unaware how he became entitled to the right of flying it, be ting, as he is / a native and a resident of Soor, and you have not given me any explanation on that point.

H.B.M.'s CONSUL at Muscat to Monsieur C.Dorville French Vice Consul at Muscat, No. 124 dated 8th April 190jl, 1. I learn that in the course of disturbances atSoor among the tribesmen of Sbor and Jaalan the followers of a cer tain subject of the Sultan of Muscat, namely Abdulla bin Salim Shaikh of the Beni Abu A^i tribe of Jaalan and Soor, interfer ed with a bugalow in the!Soor creek belonging to another sub ject of ijis Highness Seyyid Peisal named Mubarak bin Hamed Razaiki, resident and domiciled at Soor and that the said bugalow hoisted the French flag, I also learn, from His High ness, that you have called upon him for satisfaction in this matter on the grounds thqrb the said Mubarak bin Hamed is under French protection, and that he considers such a claim is in compatible with his independence. I have the honor to observe that the disturbances at Soor during which the incident in question occurred, have been in progre6 4 ^ for some little time past and to my c,ertain knowledge appertain purely to the internal tribal feuds of 0- man, and I therefore feel it incumbent upon me to protest most strongly against your action, which constitutes interference in the internal affairs of the Sultan's territory of a nature which is altogether inconsistent with His Highness's indepen dence and, pursuantly, with the mutual Declaration of our Gov ernments dated 10th March 1868. Moreover in the absence of special instructions from my Gov ernment, I cannot admit the title of the said Mubarak bin Ha med, or of any other subject of the Sultan of Muscat, to rights under the French flag while in Oman territory or terri torial waters, until favoured with an intimation from your self giving a list of the persons and setting forth the title of each individual to fly the said flag;■for the information and consideration of H.M.'s Government, which, under the De- *ctarationclaration aforesaid, is clearly eh^itled t,o be •consul'ted -in the matter. » 3. It must, I think, be pla^n to you that, to avoid any misunderstanding between us, it is very necessary that the Bri tish Consul should be furnished by you with such an explanatory list / but' I have not hitherto been favoured with one by your predecessors and H$s Highness^likewise not having received one / is unable to furnish mfe with a copy; Meanwhile I am sure you will agree that a state of things which makes it' possible for any subject pf the Sultan during the pro gress of internal inter-tribal disturbances in Oman, in which he or hts tribe are concerned, to hoist a foreign flag and claim protection under it against his Omani fellow-subjects ( and therefore againstvthe Ruler of the country) constitutes a position which is a direct encroachment upon the integrity of the Muscat Sultanate, which my Government Is bound to see preserved; and is, at the same time, incompatible with the terms of the Declaration of ^868, above- referred to. I have accordingly the honor to inquire whether you cannot see your way at the present juncture to favour me with a com plete list of His Highness the Sultan's subjects over whom,as in the case of Mubarak bin Hamed, you claim to extend you pro tection within the territory and territorial waters of the Sul tan's dominions; in order that I may be able, after ascertain ing the Sultan's views in each case, to submit the matter to my Government,000^ ftp b Copy of letter from Major P .Z.C0X H.B.M.'s Consul at Muscat to Monsiejtr C.Dorville Vicfe Consul for France at Muscat, No.186 dated 10th April ^903. 1.

I note that you feel unable at pres-ent to favour me with any list of the nature requested^not having received any instructions to that effect. Perhaps, however, I may look forward to receiving the information at a later date af ter you have made a reference to your Government. In the abr: sence of such information I can only repeat that I specifical ly impugn the title of the said Mubarak bin Hamed, or any other subject of His Highness the Sultan, similarly situated, to any rights of protection under the French flag while in the territory or territorial waters of Oman, and that I must take objection to any action of yours implying a claim on your part to accord such protection.00028 Translation of a letter addressed by Shaikh Abdulla bin Salim A1 Hamoodeh to Major P.Z,COX, Dated Soor 2nd April 1903, After the usual greetings. We arrived here at Eigeh (frart of Soor) in connection with a dispute outstanding between us and the tribes of the 4'ennebeh, Hasham and Beni Rasib, As they all submitted to us we made peace with them after getting what we wanted from them. See ing that we closed both against them and the Hinawis the creek of Soor and all the routes from the interior, the Beni Ghafir came to us and made terms but we are still bloclfcading the road5 leading to the Hinawi country and hostilities are still going on between us and them. Be it known to you, 0 friend, that your subjects the Banians are giving assistance to our enemies the Beni Bu Hassan and Hijrieen (i,e.Hinawis) by supplying all their villages with rice and dates. This is very hard upon us / and I beg you to deter them from this practice in order that we may be able to weaken our enemies. I am sending this letter by my messenger^ Ferooz^and I shall be obliged if you will send the answer by him together with some cartirdges, as many as possible if you * please. I am awaiting your answer in Eigeh and Salaanu Dated Eigeh, 2nd Muharram 1321, N .B.

A «Translation of a letter addressed by Major P.Z.COX to Shaikh Abdulla bin fialim in rep^y to the foregoing. Dated 9th April 1903. After the usual greetings. I have received your esteemed letter dated 2nd Muharram and understood its contents cjthd am glad to hear you are well. Referring to what you say about our subjects the Banians as sisting your enemies, I feel sure that they would not inten tionally do such a thing, but remember they sure traders pure and simple and pursue their calling without knowing anything of the tribal affairs of Oman. As you know, the Arabs in all parts of Oman are in the habit of fighting among themselves, and this is the will of (fbd and cannot be helped, but British subjects have no concern,with this. I will tell my people what you say and am quite sure they would not willingly help either one side or the other, I hope that I shall soon here that the war between you and the Hijrieen is at an end for it is not hidden from you that war is very bad for the country. As for the cartridges which you ask for, I am sorry I have none that I can send, but your Sultan the Seyyid no doubt looks after your wants in the matter.

On Wednesday the 8th instant there arrived by the mail steamer from Bombay five Arabs Qt Soor. ^hree had paid second class fares in order to escape quarantine and two came as deck passengers. The three second class passengers were allowed on shore subject to daily medical inspection by the Sultan's Health Officer, the other two were sent with the rest of the deck passengers to the quarantine station in a bay some three miles from Muscat, ' The 8nd class passengers duly came for medical inspection on the morning of the 9th and got no permission to leave Muscat, on the contrary, they are stated to have asked permission^and^ as a matter of course.to have been refused it. In the evening however after conferring with Khamis bin Mubarak Razaiki the man who had come to complain of molestation by Abdulla bin Sali®, (vide my letter No.138 of today's date) these three 8ndSnd class passengers, whom it now transpires all claim French protection, left in a hired native craft for Soor. In the morning the guard on duty at the Sultan s quaranuine station reported that two deck passengers had disappeared du ring the night and on further inquiry it was found that the three Bnd class men had also aecai^ed from Muscat by sea du- ring the night. His Highness thereupon sent his quarantine Superintendent, over to the Consulate to inform the Health Officer (the Agency Sur- ■ geon) and myself and to ask me what courae I recommended. As the night had been windless it was'^robable that the dhow in which the parties were believed to have absconded could have made much progress,accordingly, at the Sultan s desire^X ad dressed Captain'Pears commanding-H.M.S.'Rerseus' and requested him to send his steam cutter after it, and this he was good enough to do* 4.. The steam cutter was accompanied, on behalf of the Sultan, by the official in charge of the local quarantine ac tion, and the partes were in due course overtaken about 30 miles from Muscat. On the approach of the steam cutter they are understood to have run ashore and endeavoured to escape over the rocks^but were apprehended and brought back to Muscat. They were handed over at this Consulate about 9.45 P.M., and the Sultan was informed,but,owing to the lateness of the hour^ he requested that they might remain here and they were accord ingly kept in the guard-room of the Consulate till morning. Soon after daybreak this moving (11th) His Highness wrote to me officially asking me to express his thanks to the Commander of the 'Perseus' for his effective action and begging me to keep the men a little longer until he had been able to make arrangements for their safe reception. This I acquiesced in and at a later hour duly handed them over to an official and guard sent by the Sultan to receive them. They were taken di rect to the quarantine station to complete their term on the expiry of which His Highness intends to prosecute them. Before00033 Before they left, and the Agency Surgeon being, indisposed, after obtaining the Sultan's acquiescence, I took the state ments of all five men. Three of them.claimed to be 'French subjects out and out. Monsieur Dorville has addressed me protesting at my having 'imprisoned' three French proteges and I have replied that five Soori subjects of the Sultan broke quarantine and ha^e been apprehended^ and that I am unable to admit his right to address me on a matter which concerns only the Sultan and his Health Officer.

Question of French flag has just now ©risen acutely, under the circumstances following:- Firstly, During inter-tribal disturbances of a purely inter nal nature, within the precincts of Soor, the dhow of a French \ flag-holder was molested by fellow-tribesmen. French Consul in official letter demanded satisfaction and compensation from the Sultan. Sultan declined to consider claim and I protested against action of colleague. Secondly, A French flag-holder of Soor having arrived by mail ♦ from Bombay and being subject to quarantine detention broke quarantine himself, abducted his two followers from quarantine station during night and absconded to Soor, Ends. If His Majesty's .Government cannot 9ow bring question of French flag to definite adjustment the position of the Sul tan of Muscat will become intolerable. P-0008$ SECBET TELEGRAM .

' I have now acted in this capacitji for three years past, first ' under Captain Smith, then under Captain Grant and now under ' Captain Lethbridge. ' The detention rules are briefly these;- , 11 'Deck passengers are sent to the quarantine station ' direct Svem the mail steamer and remain there a ' week i.e.until the morning or eve of the arrival ' of the following mail steamer. ' Second class passengers (native) who really only ' pay second class fare to escape going to the qua- ' rantine station, but who otherwise mix with the ' deck passengers throughout the journey, are al- ' lowed on shore, but have to report themselves daily ' at the hospital for medical inspection for a week. ' Occasionally when second class passengers are ' bound for distant Oman ports by dhow and the jour- ' ney takes several days they have been allowed ' after remaining three or four days in Muscat sub- ^ject to medical inspection to spend the remainder of their time at sea. 'By last mail there arrived five Sooris. They were all of one ' party and fed together but two had deck passages and three ' second class passages. Abdulla bin Khamis was the chief ' man of the party. He came tQ me on board and in the pre- ' sence of several other passengers said 'If you can accept 'anything and not send these two men of our party to the qua- ' rantine I am ready to give it to you.' I said^ no, I was not 'for anything of that sort,♦ ' Next day in the morning at 8 o'clock all three came to Hos- ' pital together for inspection, I was there. After inspec- ' tion Abdulla said to me ' we want to go away today'. I re- ' plied 'No, how can you possibly go you have only just ar- .rived' riv;ed.. Wait; a .few days and 'bhen see if* 'the Saheb will let. you ' go a day or two before time'. They replied 'Very well we ' will do as you say', ' I did not know of their departure without leave till, next 41 morning when the quarantine sepoy came over from the quaran- ' tine station and reported that two Sooris had absconded du- ' ring the night, I at once went to the bazaar and made in- ' quiries and found that the three second class pass,engers had ' gone too (in a Taiwi badan) and it was plain to me that they - ' had all gone together. ' It is quite evident that the whole thing was planned pre- ' viously because the two men who went to quarantine took no- ' thing with them but what they stood up in. They left all ' their kit with Abdulla, obviously so that they might have ' no impediments when breaking out of quarantine, I reported ' the matter to His Highness and he told me to report to the ' doctor and to say that this sort of thing could not be allowed 'and desired him to consult with Major Cox as to what ought to ' be done. As the Doctor was sick with fever when I went to ' his quarters I was taken on to Major Cox, in the result the ' 'Perseus's' steam cutter was sent after the truants and His ' Highness sent me in her to represent him and to identify the ' persons. We overhauled one'badan en route but found it was ' not the one. When nearing Ras Khanan we spied a badan com- ' ing our way from the direction of Soor so we got alongside ' and asked if they had met the Taiwi badan. .They said 'Yes ' but they have gone right along cloae to the shore', .They ' gave us the direction and we followed it. In the course of ' time I made out the sails of the badan in the distance. As ' we approached the occupants hauled down their sails and I ' saw them disembarking with my field glasses, this looked ' suspicious. The Lieutenant in charge thought it might be a ' fishing boat but I said X N 0 &gt; these must be the men we want,' ,r .The place where we came up with them was overhung by the steep sides of a cliff and they could get nowhere. One pretended to be00044 be going off to . make water, one was doing something else but they could not get away. Two or three Khallasies of the badan were left by them in the boat. When I called them they said 'What's up what do you want?' I called out the name of each and said we had come for them and they came without further trouble seeing we were armed, „The rest is known to your honor, BEFORE ME, Sd, P.Z,GOX Major, 11th April. ) TfiUE COPY, HEAD CLERK,0004^ STATEMENTS Off, PERSONS WHO BROKE OUT OP QUARANTINE ON THE NIGHT OP 9th APRIL 1905.

This (right of) protection has existed from of old and your royal ancestors agreed to this French protection and honoured and respected the French flag. And now I call upon Your Highness to pay up 1,500 dol lars as compensation for the detention by Abdulla bin Salim of the buggalow before mentioned, that being the amount claim ed by the owner. And with regard to the piercing of the flag with bullets that matter is in the hands of my .Government, This is what had to be explained and salaam.u u v, Translation of a letter addressed to His Highness the Sultan by the French Vice Consul, dated Muscat April 11th 1905.

May you be preserved and salaam.0005 Translation of a letter addressed by His Highness the Sultan to the French Consul at Muscat; dated 18th April 190S, After compliments. Yesterday your honor addressed me two official letters one on the subject of the interference by Abdulla bin Salim with the dhow of Mubarak bin Hamed Razeiki, and the other regarding the Sooris who absconded from quarantine. In the first connection you demand of me the payment of 1,500 dollars as an indemnity for the delay said to have been^caused to the dhow,' and in the second case.you require of me the re lease of three of the quarantine breakers whom you claim to 'protect'. In the first case I had before replied to you that I failed to comprehend how the giving of your flag to certain subjects of mine for purposes of security during their voyages to for eign seas and ports can possibly be allowed to ^nter into questions of a purely internal nature such as was the incident which recently occurred at Soor, As for ti^e second matter, the facts are as follows:- Five adult men belonging to Soor most flagrantly and lawless ly violated the whoLe of the quarantine regulations which I had introduced in consultation with the Consuls of all powers concerned, in the interests of public health and safety; and on the advice of my Health Officer, who superintends the pre ventive arrangements 06 my behalf&gt; i used evetjy means in my power to effect the capture of the offenders and to bring them to justice. Yesterday at the Health Officer's recommendation (after having recovered them) I gave orders about noon for them to be taken back to the quarantine camp to complete their time there; and after they have done so it is my intention to punish them proportionately to their offence, as a warning to others not to follow their example. And now you peremptorily demand their release on the grounds that three of them are underunder your protection. It is exceedingly difficult for me to entertain either of your demands' for it is quite impossible for me to see how compliance with either of them can be recon ciled with the preservation of my independence. Your honor must not imagine that it is any pleasure for me to oppose your G-overnment in any matter whatever, for the case is quite the reverse. .The .Great English -Government and your Great Government have been bound by ties of cordial friendship with me and my ancestors from of old and I am innocent of any other wish than to preserve that same friendship with both Govern ments to the end, .Then what good purpose is served by allow ing this claim to the introduction of your flag into my terri tory (a practice which does me the utmost harm) to become time after time the cause of unpleasantness between myself and you and between your Governments, as I see it does f Let it be known to your honor in this connection that the Great British Government informed me positively some thirteen years ago that^having regard to the law of nations^the employment of any of my subjects of a foreign flag (for use during their journeyings to foreign parts) carried no rights whatever as against me and within my own territories, and that I had every right to punish any subject of my own for violating the laws of my administration, no matter what country's flag he flew; and moreover that I was without the slightest doubt fully en titled to take any measures I chose for the improvement of my administration and the better control of my own subjects in my own territories and seas. Both before ahd after that expres sion of opinion I have repeatedly, both verbally and in writing to the utmost of my power, such as it is, protested against your contention that rights under your flag extend to my ter ritory and its seas. The English Government moreover, which made a treaty with your .Government in 1862, also has an inter est and a right to interfere in this flag question, which as sails my independence to its very foundatiotk. Now your honor knows well that the Great British Government and0005 and your Great, .Government have been on terms of friendship from old time and I too sun an old friend of both, and I know positively and specifically that the ministers of youtf two Governments in London and Paris have for a long time past been discussing this matter in its bearing upon the Treaty above mentioned and I am willing' to accept the result of their dis cussions and their Joint decision. Meanwhile these petty in cidents which have been occurring among us here of late can not affect the final adjustment of the matter between them in Europe, what therefore is to be gained by our corresponding about them here in Muscat ? Can you not refer to your Govern ment and leave these questions and the general question to them to deal with ? If so I will address the British Consul to the same effect. .Then there will cease to be any danger of unpleasantness arising among us all here and moreover the matter will be adjusted according to the principles of right and justice and the laws of nations. In conclusion I request the favour of your forwarding a copy of this communication to your Government, whereby I shall be obliged to you. This is what had to be written, may you be preserved and sa laam.190^. From To Major P. Z. COX, c.i.e., H. B. M.'s Consul and Political Agent, MUSCAT, L-b-COLOKEL C.A.KEMBALL C.I.E.

Sir, In continuation of my letter No.148 dated 18th.Instant, and subsequent telegram I have the honor to forward the fol- -lowing further papers for information (a) Copy of a letter addressed to His Highness the Sultan by his Health Officer, dated 14th.April and the latter's forwarding endorsement to me. The Sultan asked Captain Lethbridge for this in order that it might strengthen his hands in main- -taining the fact that the confinement of the 5 Sooris, French flagholders and others, was simply a necessary incident of Quarantine Adminis-: -tration. It must be admitted that it is no part of the business of the Health Officer to inquire which of the Sultan's subjects owns a Flag and whicj^ does noli. (b) Translation of a letter received by the Sultan from Shaikh Abdulla bin Salim,in which,at the Sultan's request^the Shaikh gives his explana tion of the flag incident at Soor. It fully bears out what has been before reported^S. As I informed .Government, in my telegram of 88nd. Instant, since the 5 Arabs were confined in one of the Forts the French Cems&amp;l has been exchanging frequent communications with his Foreign Office and has paid three personal visits to the Sultan to endeavour to induce him to release the French flagholders,or to deliver them to the French Consulate. He has also been visiting the two most franco-phile of the Sultan's advisers,namely the aged Vazier and Seyyid Badr bin Saif and enlisting their sympathies. They in turn have done their best to talk the Sultan over and work upon his timidity. Also during the past week His Highness has received from some source or other a lengthy manuscript in the Arabic handwriting of Monsieur Goguyer,purporting to be a translation of the official report of a debate which took place in the French Chamber on 11th March,in the course of which M.Peloncle stated that he had seen a statement in the English 'Times' to the effect that Great Britain intended to annex Muscat and on the strength of it called upon Monsieur Delcasse for an explanation and assurance that / / French interests and those of the French proteges would be upheld. The statement quoted as being 'presumably true as it came from an English paper' was merely the reproduction in English of one of• Monsieur Goguyer's contributions to the Novoe Vremya. The Arabic version of what passed in the Chamber which Goguyer had put in the hands of the Sultan,was I need hardly say freely manipulated to suit the present situation. The fact of the 'annexation* statement having been made by an English paper was particularly impressed upon His Highness,and in that part of the debate deal- -ing with the question of the French flagholders there were skilful interpolations of Goguyer's own,directed chiefly against the British Consul and enlarging on the measures which the French were prepared to take to protect their interests and those of their flagholders. As far as one can judge however by his outward bearing the Sultan remains quite firm in the matter and assures me that at his several interviews00060 ^ interviews with Monsieur Dorville he has given him no other answer than that which he gave in the first instance,namely that the confinement of the 5 Sooris was purely a matter of quarantine administration and that he did not see his way to release any of them. At the same time he is in a very anxious frame of mind and knowing him as I do,it is a little difficult to me to be cer- -tain that he can have been interviewed three times by the French Consul without hedging somewhat and discounting the possibility of ultimately being left alone to settle accounts with the French Government as best as he can. The Government of India will I think agree that in view of the very limited and uncertain degree of support which his interests have re- -ceived during the past three or four years from His Majesty's 1 Foreign Office in directions where they have been especially impaired,namely in the matter of the French Flag and the non- suppression of Monsieur Goguyer,there would be little ground for surprise if such a contingency came to pass. 8- I fully realise that it is particularly unfortunate that the two incidents in question should have occurred just before His Majesty the King's visit to Paris,but that can hard- -ly be ascribed to any fault of the Sultan or myself and I urgently hope that as soon as the visit has been brought to a close the Government of India will see their way to press for the speedy settlement of the whole question including the pre sent incidents,and will see that the Sultan's interests are duly safeguarded. If they are not I am convinced that our own interests in these waters,which we can little afford to attenuate at the present time,will suffer to a greater extent than His Majesty's Foreign Office perhaps realise having re- -gard to the comparative unimportance in themselves of the incidents which from time to time bring the matter into promi- -nence. Postponement of the issue now will simply mean that the Sultan will be obliged to trim and will thereby weaken his own/ own position,and further that. Monsieur Goguyer and his support- . / -ers in Paris will have time to force Monsieur Delcasse's hands by means of newspaper agitation and misrepresentation of the facts. 4. The Aged father of the French Dragoman Abdul Aziz having died suddenly,the latter obtained a few days / leave to proceed to his home and Monsieur Dorville has consequently delay- -ed his departure for Soor. It is possible too that he is await- -ing the arrival ofja ship, but I have no information on that point. O I have &amp;c., (Sd) P. Z. Gox, Major, f H. B. M.'s Consul &amp; Political Agent, Muscat.

The punishment provided by the Indian Penal Code for such an offence is six months'imprisonment,and fine,or both and I trust Your Highness will see the necessity of awarding them adequate sentences under the-spirit of'that 6ode. I am of opinion that a money fine alone will not meet the case as it will not be apparent to the general public,and that some term of imprisonment is absolutely necessary in order to deter other persons from such flagrant breaches of the quarantine Regulations as occurred in this case. :oooOooo;— &amp;00062 s - Translated purport of a letter from Abdulla bin Salim al Hamoodeh Shaikh of the Beni Boo Ali to H. H. The Sultan of Muscat, dated 7th Muharram 1K21, corresponding to 6th April 190K,in reply to a letter written to him by His Highness say- -ing that the French Consul had made a complaint about his doings at Soor and asking him to inform him (i.e.the Sultan) what happened. :ooo: After compliments. I have received your esteemed letter and understtod its contents. With reference to the claim of the French Consul in connection with the recent incident between us and one of the Jennebeh, you are well aware of the funda mental custom (as to levy of tribute) prevailing amongst the Arabs. I have not demanded (from the tribes-men in Soor) anything in excess of my right due. With reference to the question of the Khor (Soor creek) my authority over it has been in existence from ancient times until now, and there are certain rules and laws attached to the enjoyment of the use of this creek which are known to one and all. This is as plain as the day to any person in his senses. Your Highness is also perfectly avfare of the fact. How is it then when you are fully cognizant of all the circum- -stances, you did not act and speak on my behalf and refute the French Consul's claim especially seeing that I never do anything to displease you? Reverting to my action against the Jennebeh,it was not direct ed especially against them still less against the particular possessor of the French Flag in question who complained to the French Consul, on the contrary, it was a measure applied against all the tribes (who use the creek). The incident of the French Flag was entirely the fault of the ownerowner of* 'bhe vessel who purposely put his buggalow in the way of being interfered with simply in order to get a pretext for complaining to the French Consul and getting him to interfere. For the rest Your Highness is the best judge as to what answer to give the French Consul. * I am sending a letter to him herewith. NOTE: - .The Sultan says he should have stopped this letter,as Abdulla bin Salim had no cause to write to the French Consul,but Abdulla's messenger stupidly delivered it at the French Consulate, or gave it to one of the French Consul's servants before he could get hold of him. His Highness presumes that his reply was to the same effect as that given to himself. ¥ ' A y(y 00063/ Secret telegrain Prom, Foreign,Simla, To, .The Political Agent,Muscat, Dated 21st,April 19015, Received 22nd April '055, My telegram of 17th,April, French Flag holders,Secre tary ofjstate telegraphs 20th April, begins: I 'We are led to expect communication from French 'Ambassador who returns from Paris next week,In the 'meantime Cox should avoid any action which might 'tend to aggravate situation or bring on crisis 'which would be peculiarly unfortunate at moment 'of King's visit to Paris,' Ends,f SECRET TELEGRAM Prom, The Political Agent,Muscat.

J5. I regret to report an act of His Highness the Sultan during the past week which seems to be injudicious and likely to be made something of by the French. In paragraph 4 of my letter No.167 dated 85th April I made men tion of the death of the French Dragoman's fatherj-and the for mer's departure for his native village. He returned on April 84th and according to established Arab custom sat in his house for two days receiving condolatory visitors. Among these was the Sultan himself, -There is nothing unusual in itself in His Highness looking in at the house of any bereaved acquaintance of respectability, and it is not to be regarded as anything but a thoughtless act on the part of Seyyid Peisal in the present instance, but con sidering Abdul Aziz's personality, and the present political &lt; juncture / His Highness's visit of condolence seems both unne cessary and regrettable, and I have taken an opportunity of tel ling him what my views are on the subject. As was to be ex pected he replied that it was merely an act of ordinary cour tesy and that it did not occur to him that there was any harm in it, but the fact is that it will give the French a reason able handle for the argument, which they are always prone to intih?duce, that in the matter of the refusal to receive Abdul Aziz, or the French Flag, or any kindred question^it is not the Sultan who is the prime mover but the British Oovernment in the back ground, 4. Owing to the rumoured date of the arrival of the French Cruiser 'Infernet' being coincident with the presence of His Majesty the King in Paris, His Highness the Sultan left on 8nd instant for the interior for change of air and will re main away until His Majesty has left prance. 5, The French Consul either not knowing what to say to theX) 00067 / the Soor community if he went there while their fellows are in confinement, or else because he is expecting the 'Infernet' to take him down, has postponed his departure, but has sent his Dragoman, Abdul Aziz, in his stead, to see that the Titres de Navigation are in order.00068 Copy of telegram from Foreign Simla to the Political Agent Muscat dated 28th April 1903, Your telegram 88nd April.

There was no sign of any French iian— of—war however but apparent ly the French Dragoman had been promising the arrival of the 'Infernot' from day to day bringing home the released prisoners and the Perseus which arrived at dusk was mistaken by them for that vessel.

All was repofied well onshore, Abdulla oin Salim was still in his country and the hostilities current between him and the Hinawi were said to be dying out.

It, will oe remembered that the French Commodore visited the Sultan's representative, his brother Seyyid Ma homed bin Turki, on the ISth instant. Seyyid Mahomed ao- oorling to usage returned the visit the following morning. An account of what x^ssed while he was on board the 'Inter- net M is furnished in a sefparate memorandusi (enclosure No.l.) Seyyid Mahomed, I may mention, is a man of totally differ- ent calibre to his younger brother the Sultan, being some what hot-headed and lul^le^tempered. Immediately on land ing from the H Infemet ,, l he sent a message to me asking me to come over and see him and on going to the Palace I found him in a state of considerable agitation and anger at the treatment he had received at the hands of Commodore Fores- tier* One of his suite had,at his direction, made pencil and notes, during the interview, o what had passad^as to the language.language u. 9 d, and «ith the help of the notes thus made Seyyld teihomed gave me an account of what had ooourred, whioh I have recorded in the memorandum aoove mentioned. 55, The reason why the Commodore praotloally dropped the 3oor incident altogether and took his stand on the question of the release of the imprisoned proteges ( a much more trivial matter on its merits) is not far to seek. The imprisonment of the quarantine-breakers is a matter which, .as it should be, is apparent to all. Added to that, as previously reported, there are a numoer of Sooris in Muscat, relations and friends of the Flag-holders, who have Deen for some time clamouring at the French Consulate for the.release of their comrades, and have been put off with assurances that the arrival of the 'InferneV would effect that end immediately. Ilhe oontinuance of the pro teges in confinement after the 'Infemet's' arrival consequent ly places the P'rench in an awkward position, and they are anxious to save their face. 4, While I was listening to Seyyid, Mahomed's account of the interview his clerk returned with the Araolc translation of the Commodores letter. Neither it nor the original French version, in the Commodore's handwriting, were signed by anyone and the clerk said that he had pointed lihis out to the French Consul and had asked him to sign the letter but that he had refused saying however that perhaps the Coiraaodore would sign it if it were taken to him. I advised Seyyid Mahomed that he should refuse to accept it or to send it to his brother until it was duly signed as it might afterwards be repudiated and he accordingly sent his man off to the Commodore with the Arabic translation for signature. Mean while I took a hurried copy of the French original, which X now enclose (enclosure No.8). This happened about 13 noon. During the afternoon the inci dents of the morning and the threats of the Coaanodore were pub lished abroad and caused a good deal of excitement and unrest; and000$ 2- and in view of this fact,, and also bacause Commodore ti er's conduct,, after what he had said to me the previous day, Baemad extremely unscrupulous and disingenuous, I addre^oed a oommunioation to the ^ench Consul in the evening intimating that I v&lt;as prepared to support the Sultan's authority in the matter of the quarantine-oreakers, seeing that the flag quae- , ' ■fcion was unolQi* di sous si on In London* The commodore's letter duly signed was sent out to the Sultan in the evening but apparently,found him only a few miles away and His Highness reached Muscat the same night. In t.h . .orn ing he informed me that he had thought it beet to come in and * get the matter over,out that he had not the least intention of giving in and that if the British Oovernment were prepared to be firm in his support he was equally prepared to see the mat ter through in order that the issue might be settled once for all. I repeated to him the assurance which the Secretary of State authorised we to give him and impressed upon him parti- ' oularly that in pleading justification for his action he should he careful to .uake his chief argument the fact of the flag question being under negociation in Europe. I subsequently put the same in writing to him. At nine o'clock a.m. the French Consul called upon him, out merely to arrange an hour for the Commodore's visit in the evening. This was duly fixed, and at 4 p.m. the Commodore landed, accompanied by twelve of his officers. The French Consul's cavasse was sent on ahead to inform tn* Sul^n that after being introduced to His Highness's suite the Commodore wished that the latter should oe dismissed from the Tlurbar room, so that they could see him by himself. In this the Sul tan and his brother refused to acquiesce, saying that as tne Commodore was accompanied by a doxen or so of companions so vould they be. The request was not pressed. Nothing passed during this interview, which was purely formal, but the Sul tan was asked to come on board the 'Infernet' the next morn ing, toe Commodore saying that he had business which would'bake throe or four hours 'to discuss, The Sult»an would have been quite Justified in doo3 ining this honour as hi^ brother had already paid an official visit to the 'Infernat' in his behalf two days before but he apparently thought fit to comply and went on board at 8 a.m. the next Morning, disembarking a- gain at 10,45. The details of what p^assed are recorded in de tail in enclosure ^ of this letter, B, It will be seen that on this occasion again the Soor incident was practically left out of the discussion, no doubt in the hope of getting some concession fro. the Sultan in the matter of the prisoners. In this latter connection it is in teresting to note how very little the alternative of handing the prisoners over to the Trench Consul for custody was brought forward, in fact only at the very end of the interview, as a last resort; the reason oeing no doubt that such a course if carried out honestly would not fully appease the oooris. As a matter of fact the French Consul has no place where he could confine them, so far ha ' 9 falled A to make any headway with the Sultan with regard to the imprisoned proteges. It seems very probable that the ?renoh will revert to the flag incident at Soor and endeavour to ooae to issue with the Sultan over that. 6. Sinoe writing the above I learn that there is another very good and suffioient reason why the French are not now pressing the natter of the att^fk on the dhow at Soor. It will he remembered that in the Civil suit of noguyer Vs: Aodulla oin (vide this office letter N0.W9 of 38nd Kovemoer 1908) Goguyer was ordered by the Consul to refund 7,000 dollars to the de fendant. He appealed to the High Court at Reunion, which some time ago rejebted the appeal and 7,„oo dollars is consequently now due to Abdulla oin Ali; but the Gonsul has informed the latter that he will not take any action towards obtaining the refund from Ooguyer until the indemnify of 1,600 dollars ol aimed in the dhow question is paid. The Sultan has received this information through Abdulla bin AliOQ074 All but, has not moved in the matter yet and it would be use- leas his doing so at the present Juncture. It will oe plain from the aoove however that subject to any assistance we can give, the French have the remedy for the Soor incident in their own hands. I have the honor to oe, SIR, Your most ooedient servant, 2. Major, H.B.Ivl. 's CONSUL POT i ITIOAI j MUSCAT.snclostto; no,i. Momoraiiduia of what» i^assad at» Interview on ooard the 'In- ^emet» ,, oetv»een Seyyld Mahomed bin Turki, brother of the Sul tan, and Commodore •♦'orestierj Dated l^th May On going on board Seyyid Mahoiaed was not shown over the ship as is usually done on such occasions, but was taken straight to the Captain's cabin. Seyyid Mahomed retained four compan ions with him; the others were left outside. CoiruBodoro Pores tier at once proceeded to business saying that he had been deputed by his Government to ootain settlement of three matters (a.) 'The violation of the ^rench -Tlag by Shaikh Aodulla bin Salim at Soor, (b.) The misappropriation by Abdulla bin Salim of part of the dhow's cargo, (c.) The imprisonment of the threo French pro- / teges in Muscat. Ho oontlnuad tha'. the flrat two incident* the ?rench Govem- iaant were prepared to overlook, but Kith regard to the third ha had received Iraper^tlva orders fron hia Government to exact coiiplete and prontpt aatlsfaotlon. He went on to domnd the ln^ rcedlEite relec-se of the prisoners, saying that ha would give Mahomed oln Tury.l 8 hours In which to oonply. Seyyid rtahomed replied that this was quite Impossible and that In any case he himself had no power to tako any action in the natter in the absence of the Sultan. ' ■ The . CoiaaoAore and Monsieur T &gt;orvl31e then oegan to coax Sey yid Mahomed, saying that he was in a position to release the proteges if he chose and that It was roost Important to the ?rench Oovemment that they should be released and that if he could by any means arrange it he would receive an expression of the cordial thanks of the 'rench Oovemment. Seyyid Maho«.ed replied that he would not dream of doing such /a thing in the Sultan's absanca and without hia ordars. In that case said the Commodore it was imperatively necessary that the Sultan should be orought back at once and he would give His Highness 48 hours law, Seyyid J ahoraed answered that if the Sultan was not busy he might come in but that it was very possible that he might be detained by other business. The Commodore then proceeded to accuse the aosent Sultan of having fled to escape the 'Infemet'. Seyyid Mahomed replied that he had absolutely no grounds for suggesting such a thing and that his brother always went away at this time of the year. He added H What had he to fear from the Infernet? If anyone is at fault in the matter It is entire ly your own Consul who gave the Sultan no intimation whatever that you or the 'Infernet' were coming. If he had done so, as it was his business to do, the Sultan woul i not have gone away, M The Commodpee then rejoined that anyhow it had been telegraphed to Paris (by Ooguyer no doubt) that on receiving news of the coming of the 'Infemat' the Sultan had fled.to the interior, Seyyid Mahomed said it was-a libel. The Commodore and Consul then had recourse to intimidation. The former drew his sword from its scabbard, laid it on the tab 1 and said 'now you have got to chose one of two alterna tives, /ou Viill either release those three branch proteges, in which case the ancient friendship between Muscat and .y'rance will endure and increase; or else you will persist in your refusal case t,o release them, in whloh the result win oe this, the Sword. What do you think you will gain oy this and what do you suppose the British Government will do In the matter? Remember the fate of Zanzibar, whloh Is now under the thumb of the British. That will be the fata of Muscat too. Look too at this brdar on my breast. I got this for services in reference to An,1buan. Your own kinsman Hamood bin Hamed shewed himself hostile to the ?renoh and the result was that I was sent to punish him and I oaptured his country and added It to the French dominions. You had better take warning,' Similar arguments and threats were ^ naxo repeatied for soma time* Then0007(7 Then Seyyid Mahomed asked the GonyaodLore to put in writing to the Sultan the words and threats Just used to him, 'Eie Com modore replied at first that he wouM notj^ but on being pressed he said he would write some thing and thereupon sat down and wrote a letter in pencil which was read out to those present. On hearing it Seyyid Mahomed said:- *• That is not at all what you have said to me; write to him in Just the same ternis in which you have spoken to me'. The Commodore replied that he ?fe.s not going to write any more but that the rest of what he had said could be imparted to the Sultan by Seyyid Mahomed himself if the latter so wished. He then handed Seyyid Mahomed the letter, written in French, and returning his sword to his scabbard said he hoped he would not have to draw it in anger; it would oe a bad day for Muscat if he did, Seyyid Mahomed observed that it was no use his send ing the letter to his brother in its present form as His High ness had no one vrtio understood French, and asked for a trans lation of it. He was told to send a clerk to Monsieur Borville as soon as he got on shore to take down a translation of it; Monsieur Dorville having no one at present who could write the translation. Thus the interview terminated and Seyyid Mahomed took his de- partur e,^ 00078 1 smoranclura of what passed at interview on board the R, ^ 'In- lernet' between the Sultan of Muscat and the French Commodore Porestier* 15th May 3 9or% { Noted down from the statement of one of the Su3tan's suite, who was present during the interview and was sent over to me immediately afterwards with written notes of what had passed, and also from the account related to me later by the son of the late Vazieer who was also one of the Sultan's fompanions and was present throughout,) (A*) As on the occasion of Seyyid Mahomed bin r i?urki's visit to him Commodore Forestier opened the conversation by saying that he had been sent to Muscat by his Government to obtain satisfaction aoout three matters (1 # ) Violation of French flag flown on dhow at Soor. (S«) Detention of said and robbery from her cargo. (!% ) Imprisonment of French proteges in Muscat. With regard to the first two matters it was possible the French Grovernment would overlook them, or at all events postpone the discussion of them for the present. With regard to the third incident the French Government would brook no delay and he had aosolute orders to settle the mat ter satisfactorily. The following conversation then took place Commodore ;Has Your Highness any desire to keep up the friend ship which has always existed between the French Government and your ancestors? Sultan ; For a reply to that question you have only to refer to your Consul, to whom I have very recently written a0 a vsvy clear expression of rny feelings on tihe pointy ( i.e.Sultan's letter of 12th April.) Commodore: Then why have you oppressed French suojects? Sultan ; I have never oppressed French subjects. I do not admit that the persons, to whom I Know you refer, are .^eiich suojects. Domraodore; How can you say that when you know that from time immemorial they have frequented our colonies and have French papers and flags and are recognised wherever tliey go as French subjects ? And why did you bolt from Muscat as .soon as you heard the 'In- fernet' v^as coming? Sultan: You forget that the French Government, though I have often asked them have never given me any infor- m mation as to whom they oomplatn to ^jrotect find whom they do not. How am I to know? Besides that mat ter is, as you well must know, under discussion be tween the Snglsiia. and French Governments in Europe and it is notorious that they have had Ions corres pondence aoout it which is still t-;oin^ on and the British Consul too has been corresx^onding with your Consul aoout it. Until those negociations are fin ished I claim that there is no one among my Omanis who is not my subject. As for bolting for fear of the 'Infernet' the suggestion is absolutely baseless. Why should I run away. You never warned me that she was coming and I always go to the interior at this time of the /ear. (B.) The Ooiiauodore then too 1 ! out the 'Treaty book and read out the Declaration of 1863 and also the French Gomineroial a.c~ Treaty and discussed the... and said the Sultan was bound cord proper treatment to French subjects. His Highness replied that he could not ..talk fron that X'oint aa the persons under own referance 'were his^juojects in his opinion. Commodore Forestier then said he now begged His Highness on be half ' —'■ — ——— — msr-'- '■00079 half of tha French Q-overnment to forgiva and release the pri soners as an act of olemency and added that he asked him this In the first instance as a favour and not threateningly* 'Bie Sultanreplied that it was not possible; that the case was not one Into which favour or sentiment could properly enter; that the prisoners in question were offenders who had flagrantly snapped their fingers at al3 the quarantine regulations which had oeen framed for the v safetyliof the ooiraaunity at large, v/ith the concurrence and in consultation with all Consuls in Mus cat, and had thereby coiwuitted a very serious ((Offence, not only subnersive of his ov*n lawful authority, but prejudicial to the interests of all civilised peoples, and that it was absolutely nocessary, on public grounds, that they should oe adequately punished. The Gommodore hereupon produced a telegram which he said he had Just received from his Government in which he was directed to telegraph the result of his negociations Ue. as to whether the Sultan agreed to release the proteges or not, and informed the Sultan that he required a categorical answer. His Highness replied that he had already given hit. final answer and had none other to give. Commodore said he would allow him till UiQ o'clock to re-consider the matter. The Sultan replied that he did not require any time for re -consideration. (G.) The Commodore then adverted to the details of the arrest of the men. 'Whu had the Sultan allowed a British raan- of-war to arrest them?' The Sultan replied:- 'Thy should I not? This was a very small matter. I have no steamlaunch of ^ own and therefore a^Ked the 'Perseus' kindly to place hers at my disposal. That was there In that? Suppose for a minute It had oeen your ship here Instead of the 'Perseus' and I had asKed you for your steamlaunch would you not have accomodated me in sucn a manner?' r.nmmodore ; Ho, I should not. 3^^ you Know oest, but I think you would. Oommodore: It Is *&gt;«r Highness's ouslness to keep a a .earn launchlaunoh of your own for quarantine work such aa t*his« Sulban ; That may possibly be the oase, out. if so why did your Consul not. point, that out to me oefore when cjuai'an— tine was first started, fr any time in the last tliree years? (D,) Coiomodore : Then again why were the laen imprisoned on board a British man-of-war the 'Perseus'? Sultan ; Have you any good grounds for saying that because, as far as I know, the prisoners were oroucht straight from the launch to the British Consulate, Commodore ; Than why were they imprisoned at the liritish Consulate Sultan ; They wei'e Drought back to i us cat in the middle of the nit5ht and were taken straight to the Health Of ficer who lives at the British Consulate. Then they had to await my orders and during the night I do not allow people into my palace, and so they were detained at my request at the British Consulate ti31 Mie ne::t day, Coiij-.odore ; Then again why were they afterwards sentenced to imprisonment and not to a fine? (At this stage the Commodore sent for his ship's doctor who read out some section of a French law code which purported to so persons breaking quarantine rules must be ^ined and and that imprisonment is not obligatory#) Sultan : Laws and punishments differ in different places. In this case I considered that imprisonment was neces sary and my Health Officer, who conducts a' 5 7 my qua rantine arrangements, was, of the ea»-e opinion, and wanted them properly punished, Comnodore ; I am credibly informed that people are habitually abscondinc from quarantine and that no one minds and that the quaran ine arrangements are not nih by rule at all. Take the 'Pomone' for instance, which has just cone fro. Bombay, I don't believe the Doctor hasf6' I Sultan; /■ &gt; -r 00080 has been near har# It is absolutely untrue what you allege aoout peo ple absconding Trora quarantine^ and a£ to the 'Po- iione' I have no doubt the Doctor has made proper arrangements aoout her* Captain Lethoridge is not the first person to superintend quarantine arrange ments here. I first had tv/o medical men of my own in charge, t^or the last three years I have had a Medical British.Officer.of whom the present one is the third and I am confident that the work is done very care- fully. The arrangements v.ere devised in cteiumicap tion with all the uonsuls at Fuscat and ohey have made no complaints to me on the suoject. Commodore: The fact is that these people \»ere noti fairly ita— prisoned at a31; you are in the liands of the Bri tish Government and 'ijatiaged' oy them and it is they who have got this done arbitrarily. Uulti.n : That is not true at all. I aiu not 'iflanaoed' 1 oy. the British Crovernment in any v/ay. I 'manage myself* but if I want any assistance fi'om the 'ritish ^ov— ernment find ask for it in any matter thai give it me. The present case was dimply a matter of qua rantine. My Doctor wanted the people punished and I agreed that it was necessary* You can see my .Ooc tor if you like on the subject. f.i-m.inodore ; I have nothing to do with your Doctor. If you are the sultan of thi E vlaoa in faot as well .3 in name we ask you as a favour to release these prisoners. Sultan ; I regret I cannot do so.

But it will be a great pity if there is death and bloodshed in Muscat) and you had better re-oonsider in time. Sultan; It you are ordarea to proceed to violence you will no douot do so. I must take my chance of that, 'That else can I do? Commodora ; And Your Highness surely does not suppose that the British Government will fight with the French Gov ernment over a little matter like this, at the oid- ding of Lajor Gox? Sultan ; I don't see what Major Cox has to say to it, or why he should oe introduced into the matter. Gomi .iO -.lor8 ; I/Tajoi.'

The Sultan replied that he could not do so. Monsieur Dorville continued that in that case at 2 o'clock they must wire to their Government to tell them of the the Sultan's refusal^ and that the result would oe that in two oonsujai or three days he would receive orders ' jo haul aoikiin his^lag and leave Muscat. The Sultan made no special reply and soon afterwards seeing that there was nothing further to be got out of him they let him take his departure.-1. To No.3./S of 1903. Major P. z. COX, cue., H. B.

After discussion in Cabinet Lansdowne informed Gam- bon that His Majesty's Government proposed reference to Hague -Tribunal on general question of privileges covered by French flag and papers, adding that if proposal were accepted His Ma jesty' s Government would advise Sultan of his own accord to re lease prisoners. Carnbon replied that arbitration would pro bably be acceptable but that he considered men must be first released and handed over to the French Consul. Full stop. His Majesty's Government strenuously resisted this proposal, further Aftex^ discussion on gist Cambon thought that it would suffice if Sultan wrote to French Consul informing him of spontaneous release and he undertook to submit this proposal to Delcasse. His Majesty's Government consider this would be satisfactory solution by which we and Sultan will have successfully asser ted authority and have resisted threats firstly of French Con- sul and afterwards of Commodore. He will release men of his own free will after adequate term of iimprisonment and as anact of clemency, because he has received assurance that French have at length agreed to refer whole question to srbitration. His Majesty's Government will seek from French Government written engagement to refer to arbitration and until this is received Sultan will retain prisoners; and thereafter at once send them of his own accord to Soor and inform French Consul and British Consul in identical note to following effect, be gins:- 'The Sultan understands that the question of the ex emption from his jurisdiction of three of his subjects who hold French flags is to be referred to an impartial Interna tional iPribunal by the Governments of Great Britain and France. .This reference is most sajbisfactory to His Highness but it may occupyoccupy some time before a definite opinion is given. On the ( here insert the date) he imprisoned three of his Suri sub jects who were alleged to be in possession of French flags and who claimed exemption from his jurisdiction. As the question of principle is about to be disposed of in a satisfactory man ner His Highness does not consider it necessary to impose xur- ther imprisonment on these men. He has therefore directed them to be released, taking from them an engagement that they will present themselves eventually to the authority which is held by the arbitral decision to have jurisdiction in the matter. \ copy of telegbam 3 juted Muscat 85rd lour secret teleg: the sultan will b prisoners before go if it is ^ sin release prisoners J should be stipuls Commodore and Pic She came here to while she is pre; fected release, it will be possi necessary our sh ferring to the t recommended to s v be any harm in s flags' the words French flag amor00088 / Copy of telegiJam from Political Agent Muscat to Foreign Simla, dated Muscat 2Srd May 190S.

I fear that the Sultan will be disappointed and will demur at release of prisoners before expiry of sentence but of course he must do so if it is a sine qua non of our support. If he agrees to release prisoners one thing is most important namely that it should be stipulated that before His Highness does so French Commodore and Flagship should leave these waters altogether.

A statement has been made in the Bazaar this morning emanating from French Consulate and made by native Naval Contractor em ployed by French Consul to the effect that the French had gained their point in negociations and that prisoners were to be released immediately. .This is only what was to be expected and makes it the more im perative that the 'Infernet's' departure should be insisted on and the men released only after a reasonable interval. In any case and no matter what letters pass between the parties below the surface, in connection with the release of prisoners, it will undoubtedly be regarded here as a capitulation on the Sul tan's part and ours and the French Consul will naturally do what he can to create and encourage that impression, and it is very important to defeat it as far as possible in arranging details of release which will be apparent to the public.0 f telegram fr jjtsd srth fey 1903 lis Majesty 's ,Goveri please prisoners t) ^ to the Hague .® t , Sultan 's subject: jjid immunity confer] .decision of tribunal kj to grant no more 'tc Consul of intending^ ter dated 11th Apri] telegram of 22nd Maj leased' Cambon has fc jaily and that we sh arrangement had beer proposal regarding p jot now be altered* ss soon as release o ia concluding senten Please secure compll Is agreement was sig: Mm of Abdulla bin tt Secretary of Sta- fressing on attentioi00091// Copy or telegram from'Foreign Simla to Political Agent Muscat dated 87th May 1905 received 28th May 1905, His Majesty's Government have undertaken to advise Sultan to release prisoners the French Government agreeing to refer forth with to the Hague Tribunal whole question of right to give flags to Sultan's subjects and of nature and extent of privileges and immunity conferred thereby, JThey also undertake pending decision of tribunal to furnish list of those who hold flags and to grant no more.

Your telegram of 87th May on subject of flag, settlement re- ceived yesterday and I interviewed Sultan. He quite concurred in reference to Hague Convention but owing to disingenuous re- ports spread in Bazaar and to the continued presence of French Flagship the release of prisoners was extremely unpalatable to him, nevertheless he agreed that it was incumbent upon him to follow our advice on that point. He has accordingly released prisoners and dispatched them to Soor and has addressed Consuls on the lines suggested, except concluding sentence. His High-, ness altogether objected to take any writing from the Sooris themselves and I did not insist. He expressed conviction that Commodore would now endeavour to coerce him regarding to mo lestation of Dhow at Soor but I endeavoured to assure him that in view of agreement at home this was improbable and would not be permitted. In order to counteract misrepresentation of terms of release I suggest-that authoritative communication be made to Bombay and tondon newspapers setting forth terms of settlement.No. 21+3 of 190 3..

Datod Muscat June 190^» SIR, I have the honor to submit a detailed report in am- plifioation of my telegram to youic address dated 39t:i l ay, 2, In ray previous to!! ecr»*ns 'of May l.'yyn, S^rd and 2Vth respectively, I had ventured to make my ovm views and the Sultan's attitude as clear to Government as I could, and I did not feel that I could presume to say anything further; and as it appeared from your telegram of 87th May that His Majesty's Government were not in a position to accept them and 3iad fi nally concluded the agreement with the French Ambassador there was clearly no other course which I could rightly pursue than to endeavour to carry out their instructions to the best of my ability. That the duty was not a pleasant one will, I think, be realised from what follows. 1 asked for an interview with His Highness the same evening and took over the Secretary of State's telegram to ex plain to him; and as he asked for something in writing which he could shew to his advisers I gave him the letter o:: which enclosure No.1 is a translation. As regards the reference to the Hague Convention; on its being thoroughly explained to him His Highness was reasonable and admitted\( v adjnittaci 'that If the Tribunal took the cusofup without delay the course agreed upon seemed likely to give finality one way or the other; that* 1 there would be a trial and that he would either win or lose**, to use his own words. With regard to the release of the prisoners he made no atterapt to confeal his dlsappointment and chagrin. He said it was all very well for me to tell him about the Hague Convention, and that he accepted my explanation regarding that tribunal and believed on the strength of what I said that the whole question would be definitely settled within a measurable time, but what was he to say to his own subjects ? His action had Ions ago become the suoject of animated discussion and interest all over Oman and people were watching for the result. How was he to explain to them about the Hague Convention ? All they would would be that know and seo^just as the French Consul had been prophe^ing for days past) the prise, ers would oe released and the French ship of war would remain and he himself would be humiliated before his people. He went on to remind me of what he had said to me on 14th May, namely that I need have no fear as to his remaining firm and that it was His Majes -y* s G-ovemeratn that I had to think most about. lie added 'the Sirkar has no diffi culty in putting down 20,000 men in Soraallland or sending troops to Aden, could she not have tone something here ?' He feared he had suffered from the King's visit to Paris. I reminded him that I had all along told him that the matter was not of sufficient political importance for two great nations to come to blows over and that in the absence of a declaration of war the sending of troops to Muscat was out of the question. I continued that it was much more in his real interests that the matter should be adjusted amicably between us and that he should try and regard the settlement effected as the most rea sonable one that the two Governments could arrange in an ami cable way. Seyyid Feisal replied that he had no intention of trying to evade the settlement made for him by Grovernment and shouldU U U /A. should release 'the prisoners ati once t)ut» he must adifllt» 'that; ■fco do so in the presence ot 'the Infernet* and t»o face t»he ad- verso oonaaenus of his subjoct.s v^ent. very much against# t»he Grain. Hhe conversat.ion 'then ended and I proceeded t»o acquaint, him with the terms in which he should couch the oorronunication which he was advised to address to the French Consul and my- seir# He accepted them with very slight modifications as will be seen from the translation at bSu ched, end osure No. S% He was altogether adverse to taking any written agreeiaent from the Sooris on the ground that it would be so much waste paper when obtained and I did not see that that ?7as a condition with his which I could reasonaoly insist on ^compliance,, in vie\. of the terms of your telegram of 27th Hay. When we made out the draft letter it v/as dated that day, 28th May, on oiie supposition that it might be twenty-four hours or % so before a craft could oe found to take the prisoners to Soor. His Highness found one ready to hand however and decided to sen! them 6ff accoM] nied by a representative the same nicht whereas the letter was not ready for dispatch till the follow ing morning, by which time the prisoners had already gone. This hoi^ever seems to oe ail unimi -^ortant detail. Had the prisoners oeen released in r us cat they v/ou3d no doubt have been made much of by the Consul and the 'Infernet and possibly conveyed to Soor by the latter, so that the Sultan was well advised in deciding to send the}; straight to 3oor. Since they left, however, telegrams oetween Muscat and Paris have been passing freely and it is suggested to me that the French are not satisfied with the dispatch of the prisoners to So or# It does not appear however that they have any grounds of complaint on that score. (.4.) Slnoe the InHervlw fuovo reported His Highness 1ms not altered tils Invariahly courteous attitude to me In rejjard to matters of dally ouslnoes routine, out the momlns follow- ina, whan my dragoraan attended morning Durbar as usual. Say- -yidyld Mahomed bin Turk! who was holding Court in the absence of Seyyid Poi sal, displayed a marked altreration in his rmnner tio my representative aiid was oarely civil. Moreover the Sultan in discussing the terms of settlement with his advisers remark ed in reference to the release of the xjx'isoners that it alnpot seea^d as if the British and French Oovernments in Europe had been in collusion to humiliate him® Other signs are by no means wanting locally to show that the release of the prisoners has been received very unfavourably, and in a way detrimeiital to our prestige^ and this lias been increased by the suddeii departure of ri.i .rjhips 'Naiad' and 'Perseus' iEunediately after the release of fjhe prisoners,^hile •t»he 'Infernet' up to time of writing shews no sign of moving. I did my best to prevent this, but other more important con siderations doubtless prevented His Jxcellency Admiral Drury from leavinis them here longer. It was not that there was the least likelihood of their active serviced? being required, and -£ a ; . .ter of fact T hud never asked for the presence of more than one ship, but as they had been obviously sent here and . ept here for the support of the Sultan, their sudden departure immadiately after the precipi tate release of the prisoners has certainly added to the im pression that the matter has been ended by the Sultan and our selves drawir.; ; in our horns and acceding to the French demand. That the impression win wear off, and,if the Hague Convention gives a decision in the Sultan's favour, will have no perma nent effect, isquito 08 but the contrary Is also the case, and I cannot help fearing that if the decision of the tribunal against the Sultan it will result in a general tendency of lo cal native feeling against us, which willagain encourage the Sultan to think that he will come off better oy maintaining closer relations with the French than with us. At all events he will require to be very carefully watched and handled tor some time to come, ^ x fear I have gone into a good deal of length and detail00096 detail but I should D e falUns in my duty to Sayyid Peisal, who from tha day I oame here has, considering the difficult position in which he is placed, always displayed a reasonable degree of loyalty in his dealinss with myself and Oovemment, If I did not put them in poaeession of the local aspect of tha case, as it at pi»eent displays itself.

After Compliments. Just after I had left Your Highness this morning I received a telegram from Government on the subject of the French Flag question, and have the honor to acquaint Your Highness with its purport. As I informed Your Highness verbally a lengthy exchange of views has taken place between the Ministers of our two Govern ments. It has had the result explained below. Your Highness is perhaps aware that in the year^lSQQ, after a discussion between representatives of all the European powers a tribunal was instituted with a view to the prevention of war in the world and for the peaceful settlement of differen ces occurring between the various powers. This peace conven- tlon became known as the 'Hague Conventlon'that is the tribu nal of the Hague; and it got this name because the place wh«re it first took place was at the Hague in Holland. The French Government has at our instance agreed to the refer ence of the entire flag question to the said tribunal forth with, and in view of that fact the British Government has un dertaken to advise Your Highness to release the imprisoned Sooris of your own accord at an early date and has instructed me to inform Your Highness accordingly. By the arrangement above set forth Your Highness's dignity will not suffer and this important matter will arrive at a settlement without further trouble. I trust therefore Your Highness will approve of the course and may you be preserved and salaam.frans lation of tiie French Cons 1905.

I have the honor to inform Your Honor that I have recently learnt that the Governments of Great Britain and Prance have agreed that the question of the immunity of those of my sub jects who possess French flags, from my authority and juris diction, and the question of the flag in its entirety has been referred to the impartial tribunal instituted among the great powers, namely the Hague Tribunal. This course commends itself to me, but probably a considerable time will elapse before a definite decision is arrived at. Meanwhile Your Honor is a- ware that on 11th Ap&amp;il I gave orders, on the advice of my Doctor, for the imprisonment of five Sooris, for absconding from quarantine, and three of them claimed the protection of the French flag, as vou inf ormed me in your letter of 11th A- •pril; and whereas the whole question of the French flag is now in a fair way of settlement, according to my information, I do not see any necessity to give them any longer imprison ment than they have already undergone and it is my pleasure to release them at the earliest opportunity. -i^-ped it expedient to let you know this, my you I have considered. ^ be preserved and salaam.

SIR, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram dated 8th September in reply to this Office letter No. E75 of Srd ultimo, and shall do my best to carry out the wishes of Government and to see that His Highness the Sultan does the same. In the meanwhile an incident has recently occurred with re gard to which, in conformity with the instructions of the Secretary of State, I have to ask for the views and orders of # the Government of India. (2.) During the afternoon of the 5th September, on my return to Muscat after a few days absence on the Batineh Coast I received an informal communication from Monsieur laronce of which I attach a copy. On making inquiries I found that the two negroes referred to had taken refuge in this Consulate as stated, and 1 forthwith sent for them and heard what they had to say. I found that they both claimed to be slaves, stating that they had escaped from their Dhow at Matra in broad daylightdaylight and had come straight to this Consulate with nothing on them or with them but their loincloths and smocks and that the accusation of theft made against them was without any foundation or possibility of foundation, and was merely the invariable al legation of a master from whom a slave has absconded. (S.) As the relations between myself and Monsieur Taronce have always been most friendly. I thought that the best thing under the circumstances would be for me to go and talk the matter over with him personally, instead of entering into awkward correspon dence with him on the subject. This I accordingly did. 1 to d him that on getting his note I had ascertained that the men were actually at the Consulate and that I had hurriedly heard their story. That they both o aimed to be slaves and had given an approximately identical account of the cause and means of their escape and altogether denied the alleged theft and the possibility of its having taken place. I said that our rules regarding the disposal of negroes claiming freedom were very strict and that I thought that the only and the proper course to be pursued was that I should, on the Sultan's return, send them over to him according to invariable custom, either for acquiescence in their freedom or for the production of adequate evidence to prove that they were not slaves or were not entitled to freedom. That he could then send such evidence as he had to the Sultan, and that If the Sultan in pursuance of that evidence could give me ad equate reasons for not granting them freedom, I would refuse them manumission papers. In the meanwhile I told Monsieur Laronoe that if he liked to come over to my house any time on Monday (I having called upon him on Saturday evening) he could be present informally whie I recorded their statements and cou d hear for himse f what they had to say. He replied that he did not think he would do that, but that he would act as I had at first sug gested and communicate his evidence to the Sultan when I sent the negroes to the Palace for inquiry. Incidentally I asked Monsieurooiiz / V Monsieur laronoe if he would let me see the evidence that he had recorded as to the escape of the men and the robbery. He acquiesced and I then found that he had recorded nothing and simply had half a sheet of foolscap with 4 or 5 lines written in Arabic in the handwriting of Abdul Aziz, stating that So and So, Nacoda of such and such a Dhow, complained that two of his crew had deserted and had taken away with them a certain sum of money. The Dhow had already sailed for Bussorah so there was no question of it being his intention to record fur ther evidence. There the matter rested until the Sultan's return in the 'Uoor-el-Bahr' for a brief visit on urgent busi ness connected with the troubles at Rostak. This was on 7th September. As soon as I could I sent him a message asking him if possible to hear the cases of the large number of slaves who had accumulated at this Consulate demanding freedom, and His Highness rep ied that he would try and do it on the morrow. On that day at 8 a.m. I visited him and in course of conver sation again reminded him of the slaves in general and at the same time explained to him the arrangement Monsieur LaroncS and I had come to regarding the two who had escaped from the Soori Dhow. He replied that he had already had a note about them from Monsieur taronce to the same effect but that he was saving again at once and that it was impossible for him to take up the cases of the slaves that day because he had a hundred and one things to attend to and moreover second his mind was too much worried with Rostak affairs to allow him to attend properly to ordinary matters of routine. He begged me to keep the s :.aves for a few more days until he returned again I asked him in,that case to give the same reply to the French Consul so that he might not misunderstand matters, and this His Highness duly did and left the same night or the following morning at daybreak. On Monday forenoon, 14th instant, I was endeavouringendeavouring to finish my work for the Bombay mail in or to leave for the Batineh in H.M, S. 'Sphinx' which was obliged, to sail at 1 p.m. when one of the employes of the Consulate came in to te 1 me that he had just seen two or three of the- Khalassies of the French Consulate pursuing through the Bazaar one of the 2 Soori negroes in Question, Moosa, who was making for this Consulate, and that they had ultimately caught him and led him off to the French Consul. I thereupon sent down to make sure that the other Soori negro was there but found that he also was absent from the Consulate and a few minutes later I learnt that both had been ar rested outside precincts of the Consulate. As I was on the point of eaving Muscat and hesitated to pen any hurried letter before starting, I went oyer to see Monsieur Laronce and asked him whe ther my information was correct and whether these negroes had been arrested by his orders. He said, Yes, he had given the orders, and believed that he was within his right in arresting them as both yesterday and today they had been seen outside the British Consulate. I rejoined that I had no pity' for the negroes, who, as well as all others who came for freedom to this Consulate had been specifica^ y warned that if they left its precincts they did so at their own risk, but I thought that in view of the amicable arrangement which we had come to with,regard to the disposal of the negroes^his action was somewhat questionable from the point of view of a consular colleague, and that in the second pace, one of the negroes at all events, as soon as he quitted the sanctuary of the British Consulate, became a subject of the Sultan of Muscat and that his (Monsieur Laroncers) high handed manner of asserting Jurisdiction over him undoubtedly gave the impression that he was prejudging the issue of the inquiry into the rights of the French Flag, now pending before the Hague Tribunal-Monsieur Laronce re peated that he was sure he was within his rights and could not admit that he was altering the 'Status quo' in any way, and that one negro he had already sent over to the Sultan's brother with the request that he would' give him a montAs imprisonment for rob bery and recover the stolen money from him, after which he did notOOIW/ lb not care what became of him and I could free him if I wished. He said he regarded the other man, the native of Comoro, as a French subject and would keep him at his own house. I asked him if he had taken any evidence regarding the alleged theft since our last interview. He said No -there was no need of that because they were caught 'en flagrant delit This was an after-thought and an extremely unlikely contingency be cause if caught redhanded the negroes would obviously not have been allowed to escape in broad daylight to this Consulate. On leaving Monsieur Laronce I learnt that the Sultan's brother and ocum tenens, in the rough and ready manner characteristic of him, had at once sent the man to prison on the French Con sul s requisition, without asking who he was or what evidence there was against him, or making any other inquiry, I left for the Batineh Coast a few minutes later and after as suring myself of the safety of British subjects at Seeb and Burka, subsequently fell in with the Sultan at Mesnaa. On learning what had passed in regard to the 2 negroes he was much annoyed at his brother's recognition of the French Con sul s jurisdiction by imprisoning the man without inquiry and expressed his intention of addressing the French Consul about it on his return. He asked me if he should argue in his let ter that the negro was under the protection of the British Consulate and I informed him that he need not say anything about that as that was my concern. His Highness will probably not be back for some days and in any case I shall hope to let Government know in advance the terms of any letter he proposes to write. (4) Though it may perhaps be ruled that my colleague was teohnloally within his rights in taking the action he did and that any question as to his procedure being a straining of the principles of inter-consular etiquette is a sentimental and personal one which cannot be pursued officially, neverthelessI trust that it will not be held by His Majesty's Government that because the general question is sooner or later to come before the Plague Convention, we should in the meanwhile allow the French thus to strengthen their position and prejudge the issue in the eyes of the local public pending the ultimate decision of the Tribunal, which is certainly some months distant and, judging from the fate of previous reference made to it, may not be fin ally arrived at for S or 3 years. Before quitting this aspect of the Flag question I take the op portunity to report that whereas Mesnaa, where the Sultan has for some time past been anchored in his Steamer, is altogether out of the way for vessels sailing from Muscat to Bussorah, nevertheless, durihg the past fortnight every French Dhow from Sobr after calling at Muscat according to custom has sailed for Bussorah via Mesnaa, and on approaching the 'Noor-el-Bahr' has run up the French Flag and sailed past right under the bows of the latter, with no other possible purpose than to defy and annoy the Sultan. Moreover when H.M.S.'Sphinx' was anchored close by, those that passed even took the trouble to steer be tween her and the 'Noor-el-BahrV We ourselves saw about 15 of these French Dhows while there and the Sultan positively de clares that during the whole period of his sojourn at Mesnaa not l^ss than 50 of them have passed him in this way, whereas the French do not admit more than 3S. Tt is hardly to be wondered at Seyyid Feisal should have been intensely annoyed at the defiance of these people and at his own impotence to take any action against them, and he did not attempt to con ceal his feelings. I take the liberty of reminding G-overn- ment that the French Ambassador undertook pending the deci sion of the Hague Tribunal, to furnish a list of the Dhows which they claim to protect, and of expressing the hope that this important condition will not be overlooked. (5) With regard to the arrest of the two negroes, if Govern ment are of opinion that I should address an official communication to-to the French Consul on the subject, I request the favour of being informed by telegram, pending which, in view of the Secretary of State's instructions, I shall not take any special action.

According to the Bania's account it appears that after high words on both sides tha Arab attacked him with a stick which he wrenched away from him. Hamed then drew his dagger &amp; struck his oppon ent in the neck inflicting a wound about 8 inches in depth. According to the Arab, the Bania first wounded him with a sword, but this appears to me very unlikely to have happened. On the same evening the Bania's elder brother &amp; the father off 8 HamedHamad bot»h left* forMuaoat» t»o prefer complaints; tihe former $ came on his arrival t»o t»his Office, &amp; t»he latter t»ook refUge at the French Vice-Consulate, where he remained for four days then returning to Soor* The Bania returned to Soor on » the 17th, as the consequence of representations made by this office to the Sultan, with him went a messenger from His Highness to his Wali &amp; Qaai at Soor directing them to send Hamed bin Ali's father to him at Muscat. •Hie both replied to the effect that the father, acting unde# the advice of the Jenebeh Shaikhs, refused to send his son to Muscat, &amp; had placed the matter in the hands of the French Vice-Consul, &amp; this morning the Sultan shewed me a letter from one of the Shaikhs of the Jennebeh tribe to himself which stated that they had disposed of the case accordingly, &amp; suggesting that the 'Christians should fight it out among themselves Meanwhile M.Laronee had written to the Jennebeh saying that he was coming shortly to Soor &amp; would enquire into the case.

JOHN BRODEICK, Mis Majesty's Secretary of State for India. S imla, the 11th August 1904. S ir, With reference to your telegram, dated the 15th April 1904, we have the honour to forward, for your information, a copy of the correspondence noted .'in the annexed schedule, regarding the claim preferred by the French Consul at Maskat on behalf of the owner of a native boat alleged to have been wrecked and plundered in the territory of the Sheikh of Debai. 2. We do not propose to discuss the merits of the case which has now been settled by the awards of a Native Religious Court. The subject to which we desire to invite attention is that of the right of the French Consul to intervene in the matter. The ostensible reason for such interference lay in the fact that Prom Captain Grey, His Britannic Majesty's tlie VeSsel ^er the French flag. Consul and Political Agent, Maskat, No. 274, dated From the marginally noted report it will 14tl^ June. geen ^ 0WIier was one Salim, a native of Suweyk in the. territories of the Sultan of Maskat, and his title to fly French colours appears to rest solely, so far as we are aware, on the fact that his father, who died some two years ago, was in possession of a French flag. This, therefore, raises the question as to whether the right to fly a French flag descends by inheritance. The point has not yet been settled, but in your telegram, dated the 21st May 1903, you mentioned that it was proposed to refer to the Hague Tribunal, inter alia, the matter as to whether such privileges could * Vide enclosure to despatch from the Marquess claimed by the heirs and families of of Lansdowne to sir b . Monson, No. 592, dated the French flag-holders. In the draft compro- 25th November 1903. mise,* this issue is not specially mentioned, and though, in the correspondence ending with our telegram, dated the 20th April 1904, we particularly desired that the reference to the Hague Tribunal be pressed, yet the exact terms of the enquiry have not been clearly stated in any document received by us. It is consequently presumed that the above point will be expressly settled. 3. The case under consideration brings to notice the action of Ali-bin- Salim in not only continuing to fly the French flag originally granted to his father, but in having also transferred it to a new vessel purchased by him, owing to the destruction of the former in the accident which lead to the settlement arrived at by the Debai Religious Court. It, therefore, remains for consideration whether such transfer can be made, and also whether a flag- holder can fly the flag on all the boats that he may possess or claim to owh, which latter action is open to even greater abuse. *In the memorandum,* handed by the French Ambassador to Lord • ride Foreign Office to Sir E. Monson, No. 384, Lansdowne, On the 14th August 1901, it dated the uth August 1901. was explained that strict instructions bad been given to their Consuls and colonial authorities not to renew existing permits of navigation, or to grant new ones, except in cases where all was found to be perfectly regular, and in particular to see that Article 32 and the following Articles of the Brussels Act were observed. Article 34 of this instrument enjoins annual renewal of the authorisation, and it does not appear that due effect has been given to the provisions of the Article in the case of Ali- bin-Salim. 4. We take the present opportunity to invite attention to the under- vide Marquess of Lansdowne to Mons. Cambon, taking given by the French Government dated the 23rd May 1903. in May 1903 that, within a reasonable delay, they would furnish the Sultan of Maskat with a list of all persons possessing permits to fly the French flag. Fifteen months have now elapsed, but no such list appears yet to have been handed to His Highness. . 'We have the honour to be. S ir, Your most obedient, humble servants, (Signed) AMPTHILL.

You will no doubt recollect that Mons.

We_ have lately received correspondence from the Government of India from which it appears that considerable inconvenience is experienced owing to the want of definite information as to the persons who have been specifically authorised by the French Government to fly thePrench flag and Lord Lansdowne wishes me to say that he hopes to be furnished on his approaching return with the list promised in May of last year.

Sir, I have the honour to invite your attention to a certain aspect of the present condition of affairs at Soor, in connection with the French Flag question. 2.- a Bania resident of that place, Dewa Din Lilla by name, has approached me with a list of debts which he is unable to recover, and has asked for assistance. . Upon enquiry I find that a sum of $.£67 is owing to him by bona fide subjects of the Sultan, and ^.646 by subjects of His Highness who hold French Flags, all being inhabitants of Soor. Syed Faisal is unable to put pressure upon the latter debtors for obvious reasons, and hesitates to take strong measures in regard to the former fearing that such action will incline them to the idea of begging for French protection themselves. FromP^rom our point&gt; of view it. would fe&gt;e inadviKsatjle t&gt;o crottipel one party t&gt;o pay without' compelling, the other to do likewise at the same time. 5,— If there was a fair prospect of the Flag question loeing settled within a reasonable time this matter migjit be allowed to stand over, but my Pt^nch colleague recently informed me that it could not be decided for at least a year. I have already represented that, from a local point of view, the French have everything to gain and nothing to los&amp; in delay ing the settlement, and I now take the liberty of urging this fact again in connection with the present difficulty. In doing so I would beg to ask. whether an under standi n'g could not be arrived at by which these and similar debts might, pending settlement of the whole Question, be recovered by the Sultan without the unpleasantness arising from French interference, 4.,- A copy of this letter will oe forwarded to the Political Resident in the Persian Cfulf, Bushire.

As to this, he wished to remind me that at one moment the French Government had put forward a series of proposals for an amicable settlement of the difficulties which had arisen between us. It was a part, of this proposal that a list of the kind which I had mentioned should be put in by the French Government. We had, however, declined to accept the proffered terms, and had proposed as an alternative recourse to arbitration by the Tribunal at The Hague. In these circumstances it seemed to M. Lelcasse that the French Government were no longer called upon to furnish the list. I said that I was not aware that the proposal had ever been dropped, and that I had always understood that the list was to oe furnished whether we went to arbitration or not.

Muscat, 14th January 1905, Sir, I have the honour to make the following report for the information of the Government of India. Three days ago a rumour reached me that the French Vice—Consul and his Dragoman had made secret arrangements for travelling overland to Soor, and intended to start immedia tely. i referred the matter personally to His Highness the Sultan who said that he had heard nothing of the project, but would write to enquire. This he did at once, and a reply was received in due course to the effect that my colleague had telegraphed, to his Government for leave to proceed to Karachi for a month s change of air, and that should permission not he granted he intended to visit Seeb or Bosher in His Highness's dominions.5.- There is no doubt, that. Monsieur Billecocq had made preparations for the overland Journey to Soor, and that he would have slipped away quietly had he not been prevented by a severe attack of* fever. Under advice from the Agency Surgeon he will now proceed to Karachi provided that a favour able reply to his application is received from Paris. 4.- Although the few commercial cases (connected with Monsieur Goguyer and others) in which I have had to employ the mediation of Monsieur Billecocq have been readily and promptly settled, and my personal relations with him leave nothing to be desired, he loses no opportunity of slighting the Sultan, and I consider it to be highly advisable that he should be dissuaded from travelling in Oman until the question of prot6g6s is finally de6ided. For the present the scheme is in abeyance, and His lighness, who agrees with me, will try to prevent its being carried into effect on Monsieur Billecocq's return to Muscat. With this object however it is difficult for him to employ more than advice or persuation in his present position. 5.- A copy of this letter wil be forwarded to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.

THE CASE ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY AND OF HIS HIGHNESS THE SULTAN OF MUSCAT. .JJ PREFACE. : ON the Hth day of October, 1903, a Convention was signed in London by the Eepresentatives of Great Britain and Erance providing for the settlement by arbitration of certain classes of questions which might arise between the two Governments, Appendix No. i. The full text of the Convention is set out in. the Appendix to this Case. On the 13th day of October, 1904, a second Agreement was signed in London by the Eepre sentatives of Great Britain and France, referring to arbitration, in accordance with Article I of the Convention of the 14fth October, 1903, certain difficulties which had arisen as to the scope of a reciprocal Declaration made on the 10th day of March, 1862, by Great Britain and Prance, whereby the Governments of the said Powers engaged reciprocally to respect the independence of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat. The full text of the said Agreement is as follows- Agreement between Gveat Britain and France, referring to Arbitration the Right of certain Muscat Dhows to ■fly the French flageta.

'When this Treaty was concluded tlie dominions of tlie Sultan of Muscat included the territories of Zanzibar, which became an inde pendent Sultanate in 1856, and in 1890 fell under the Protectorate of Great Britain, in virtue of arrangements made with France and Germany. 6. The Sultan of Muscat has also from time to time concluded Treaties of Friendship and Commerce with Great Britain. The Treaty at present in force was concluded on the 19th August, 1891, and the ratifications were exchanged at Muscat on the 20th J? ebruary, 18y2. The full text of the Treaty is given in the Appendix to this Case. The following Articles appear to be material to the present controversy, as affecting the application of the most-favoured nation clause in the French Treaty of 1844 : — ' AETICLE II. ' Subjects of Her Britannic Majesty shall, for the purposes of this Treaty, include subjects of Native States in India in alliance with Her Majesty. Such subjects shall enjoy, immediately and unconditionally, throughout the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, with respect to commerce, shipping, and the exercise of trade, as in every other respect, all the rights, privileges, immunities, advantages, and protection of whatsoever nature, which are, or here after may be, enjoyed by, or accorded to, the subjects or citizens of the most-favoured nation. ' They shall, more especially, not be liable to other or more onerous duties, imposts, restrictions, or obliga tions of whatever description, than those to which subjects or citizens of the most-favoured nation now are, or hereafter may be, subjected. 'AETICLE XIII. ff Subjects of Her Britannic Majesty shall, as regards their person and property, enjoy within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat the rights of exterritoriality. ' The authorities of His Highness the Sultan have no right to interfere in disputes with subjects of Her Britannic Majesty amongst themselves or between them and members of other C hristian nations; such questions, whether of a civil or criminal nature, shal 1 be decided by the competent Consular authorities. The trial and also the punishment of all offences and crimes of which British subjects may be accused within [1413] C8 tte dominions of His Highness the Sultan ; also tlie hearing and settlement of all civil questions, claims, or disputes in which they are the defendants, is expressly reserved to the British Consular authorities and Courts, and removed from the jurisdiction of His Highness the Sultan, ' Should disputes arise between subjects of His Highness the Sultan or other non-Christian Power not represented by Consuls at Muscat, and a subject of Her Britannic Majesty, in which, the British subject is the plantiff or complainant, the matter shall be brought before and decided by the highest authority of the Sultan, or some person specially delegated by him for this purpose. The proceedings and final decision in such a case shall not, however, be con sidered legal unless notice has been given and an Opportunity afforded for the British Consul or his sub stitute to attend at the hearing and final decision. ' ARTICLE XIV. ' Subjects of His Highness the Sultan, or any non- Christian nation, not represented by Consuls at Muscatj who are in the regular service of British subjects within the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, shall enjoy the same protection as British subjects themselves. 'Should they be charged with having committed a crime or serious offence punishable by law, they shall, on sufficient evidenc'e being shown to justify further proceedings, be handed over by British employers, or by order of the British Consul, to the authorities of His Highness the Sultan for trial and punishment. 'ARTICLE XVIII. 'The ;houses, dwellings, warehouses, and other premises of British subjects, or of persons actually in their regular service within the dominions of His High ness the Sultan of Muscat, shall not be entered, or searched under any pretext, by the officials of'His Highness without the consent of the occupier, unless with the cognizance and assistance of the British Consul or his substitute.'

Sultan against carriers of slaves [1413] C 2xo the purpose of preventing his subjects from engag ing in the oversea Slave Trade from Africa, and o preventing the import of African slaves into his dominions either in transit to other parts of the world, or for sale in Oman. By these Treaties the Sultan has entered into definite obligations as to the measures to be undertaken within his territories and territorial waters for the sup pressing of such trade. The European Powers have for many yearS interested themselves in the suppression of the oversea Slave Trade from Africa to Asia, and that trade has ceased to be carried on by Euro peans, and so much of it as still remains is carried on by Asiatics or Africans in native craft. France has for many years refused to permit the exercise by warships of any other Power of any droit de visite on the high seas with regard to ships carrying the Prench flag. Arabs con cerned in the oversea Slave Trade ('* traite des noirs 3 ') are fully aware of this policy, and have sought to obtain the benefit of the Prench flag in two ways : (1) by hoisting it without authority ; (2) by obtaining licence to hoist it from Prench Consuls in the Eastern seas, or from the autho rities in Prench Colonies or Protectorates. The existence of this abuse of the Prench flag by Asiatics has been ascertained by the experience of the naval ofiicers engaged in suppressing the oversea Slave Trade, and the attention of the Prench Government has been from time to time called to the abuse of the Prench flag by Arab slave traders. In 1890 a Conference of the Powers was held at Brussels for the purpose of concerting measures for the complete suppression of the African Slave Trade, and the Conference resulted in the passing of a General Act on the 2nd July, 1890. A copy of the General Act is annexed to this Case. The General Act was ratified by Prance on the 2nd January, 1892, subject to a provisional reser vation with a vie w to a later agreement of Articles 21, 22, 23, and 42 to 61. This partial ratification was coupled with a declaration that Articles 30— 41 would be spontaneously applied by the Prench Government in the territory of Obokh, and, according to necessity, in the Island of Madagas car and the Comoros. The effect of the partial ratification is to pre serve the claim of Prance to resist any claim to exercise on the high seas the droit d i e visite or to 7 Appendix No. 4, V &gt;11 Appendix No 5. Appendix No. 56. Appendix No. 7. InoJosure 7. Appendix No. 6. Appendix No. 10. Inclosure 1. * detain vessels under the Ereneh flag whicli are suspected of carrying slaves. The Sultan of Muscat is not a party to the Brussels Act, but his obligations as to suppression of the Slave Trade are defined by the Treaties already mentioned. Until the acquisition by France of the Colonies or Protectorates of Obokh and Tajourah, the Comoros and Madagascar, little opportunity or ground arose for the obtaining of French flags and papers by the owners or skippers of Arab dhows; but when it was found that France had not consented to the provisions of the Brussels Act with reference to the search and detention on the high seas of vessels under her flag which were engaged in the Slave Trade, or guilty of the unauthorized use of a flag, and still maintained her objections to the visife of vessels under the French flag, the owners and skippersfof native vessels who wished to engage in the Slave Trade, or from any other cause to escape surveillance on the high seas by the war ships of the Signatory Powers immediately had recourse to French authorities to obtain French flags and papers. « From the conclusion of the Treaty of 1844 until the present time very few French citizens have established themselves in the territories of the Sultan of Muscat, and at the time when the differences to be settled in this arbitration arose there were in Oman very few French citizens outside the Consular establishment, and one citizen of a Christian State not having a Consul at Muscat, who was treated as being under the French Consul, nor were any branches of any French commercial house set up in the Sultan's dominions. Consequently there were very few French citizens to take into their service any subjects of the Sultan. Notwithstanding the terms of the Treaty of 1844 and the Declaration of 1862, and the pro visions of Article XXXII of the Brussels Act of 1890, French officials in the Colonies or Protectorates of Obokh, Madagascar, and the Comoros have from time to time granted French ships' papers, and flags to subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, and the same course has been taken by the French Consuls at Aden, Muscat, and Zanzibar. Specimens of the titres so granted are included in the Appendix. The bulk of the Omanis who have thus received12 Prench papers belong to the district of Jalani and town of Sur, within the territories and subject to the sovereignty of the Sultan of Muscat. The seafaring men among this population leave Sur with their vessels and voyage to India and Africa returning at the end of the season and laying up their ships at Sur. Many of the owners of the vessels, having grown old and affluent, are content to send their vessels out under captains, and do not, themselves, leave Sur. Many of these Suri ppen 1X had been, and some still are, engaged in the over- sea Slave Trade. In February 1891 the French Consul at the British port of Aden granted French papers and flags to eight captains or owners who were subjects oAhe Sultan of Muscat and resident at Sur. Appendix No. 7. The fact was reported to the British Government, and remonstrances were addressed to the French Government, in reply to which M. Bibot, then Appendix No. 8. French Minister of Foreign Affairs on the 20th November, 1891, stated that the grant had been made in error, and that he would not fail to take the steps necessary to prevent its recurrence. This statement, made before the qualified and partial ratification by France of the Brussels Act of 1890, was understood by Great Britain to mean that France would no longer grant to Omani Arabs the use of French flags, or titres de navigation. Notwthstanding this statement, the French Appendix No. 9. authorities at Obokh in 1892 granted French papers to dhows whose owners and crews were Suris, and the French Consul at Aden referred to the authorities at Obokh dhow owners who applied to him at Aden for French papers. The Sultan of Muscat has never admitted that this grant of French flags or papers is warranted by Treaty or usage, nor that the French authori ties are entitled to make themselves judges or protectors of any of his subjects who are not actually and bond fide in the service of French subjects in his dominions. He expressed his objections so far back as 1891, and in that year Muhammad -bin-Mubarak-bin-Salim, his Wali at Sur, ordered the skippers to cancel their certi ficates and return them to the French, and this order seems in some cases to have been obeyed. Appendix No. 10. In March 1891 the Sultan furnished the British Government with a list of thirteen captains of Appendix No. 7. Suri boats carrying French colours. inciosure 9.00182(1 Appendix No. 11. Nos. 9 and 13. r Appendix No. 13. ^0 13 And the Sultan in that year took counsel with the British Government as to the use of French flags by his subjects, and was advised that the use of the French fl ig could have no effect as against him, and that he had full authority to punish any of his subjects who might infringe the laws of bis country, whatever flag or papers they might have accepted. In June 1892 the British Government received information tbat French papers had been granted at Obokh to five large buggalows, all heavily armed and owned and manned by Suris, and on the 4ith June made representations to the French Government with respect to these vessels asking for a searching inquiry. This inquiry was made, and in April 1893 M. Develle, then Minister of Foreign Affairs, stated, as the result, that the owners, patrons, or proprietors had declared that they wished to settle in Jibuti, and had obtained vixxca . jconcessions of land. The Minister, though ex- pressing himself satisfied with the result of the ^d been given , v ^ to take the greatest care in verifying the papers of such vessels and in dealing with offences. It is further to be noted that the Consuls at Muscat and Zanzibar, notwithstanding M. Eibot's admission of error with respect to Aden, have granted French papers in cases where even the formalities required in French Colonies could not be complied with, and it is particularly to be observed that certain of the iitres de navigaUon emanating from those places omit any state ment of the residence and status of the owner of the vessel, and permit the employment of a foreign crew. Notwithstanding the objections and representa tions above stated, from 1892 until the present time, the authorities in the French Colonies and Protectorates of Obokh, Madagascar, and Comoro have made a constant practice of granting French flags and ships' papers to subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, natives of and residing in his domi nions, chiefly in Sur. The applicants for the flag and papers are neither of French nationality nor naturalization ; they have no authority from their Sultan to change their allegiance, and they have no permanent residence or settlement in French territory, but merely pay fleeting visits thereto for the purpose of renewing their licenses^ Appendix No. 9. SoMe of them have gone through the form o Snclosuies 4 and 5.u buying houses, or depositing wliat is considered the value of a house in the Colony or Pro tectorate. But these transactions are of so doubtful a character that they cannot be held to justify the action of the French colonial authorities in issuing licenses to the Arabs con cerned in a manner inconsistent with Articles XXX to LXI of the Brussels Act, and not war ranted by the municipal law of France or the Colonies as to the issue of ships' papers or the grant to ships of the French flag; it might also be fairly argued that the grant of such licenses was hardly consistent.with international law and comity. Subjects of the Sultan resident in his dominions who have obtained French flags and papers in the manner above described have used the flag and papers for the purpose of the slave trade. Many reports have been received from British naval officers in the Indian Seas and from the British residents in Oman and on the Persian Gulf which establish this fact. Moreover, on returning to the waters and territory of Muscat these men have claimed— (1) That the Sultan is not entitled to board or search their vessels, or to exercise any jurisdiction over them ; (2) That they are not subject to the Sultan's authority while in his territory, but are entitled to be treated as proteges of France and to be exempt from his laws as to customs, quarantine, and other matters. In these contentions they have been on several occasions supported by the French Consul in Muscat and by the French Government. In 1894 as many as twenty-three dhows, hail ing from Sur, and owned and manned by Suris, appeared , to have possessed French papers. A list of these vessels, given in the Appendix, was communicated to the French Government on the 9th February 1895, with a request for an investigation with a view to ascertaining whether the vessels were really registered. In consequence of this despatch, a French war- ship, the Troude,' went to Sur to verify the papers of any dhow flying the French flag. The results of this inquiry were not communicated to, the Sultan of Muscat or the British Government but the Commander of the vessel was understood by the British Consul at Muscat to state that the practice of granting to Suri dhows the French flag and papers at Obokh had been stopped.15 Appendix No. 16. On the 28tli June, 1895, this statement was brought to the attention of the rrench Govern- Appendix No. 17. ment. The French Ambassador in London. eventually informed Lord Salisbury on the IGtU Appendix No. 18. March, 1S97, that there had been a misappre hension, and that there was no intention of discontinuing the practice. In May 1897 the British Government received a Report from the Sultan of Muscat, through the British Consul Appendix No. 19. there, that French papers were being obtained by Sari dhows at the Erench Consulate in Zanzibar, then a British Protectorate, and on the 4th May, 1897, Commander Hoskyns, of His Majesty's ship a Blonde,' which was cruising on the Zanzibar Appendix No. 20. coast for the repression of the Slave Trade, reported that thirty-eight dhows had changed from Muscat to Erench nationality at the French Consulate afc Zanzibar, and had obtained permission to carry passengers. In May of that year the Sultan of Muscat bad addressed to M. Ottavi, the Erench Consul in Appendix No. 21. Muscat, a protest against the grant by the Erencb authorities in Aden and Africa of Erench flags to Omanis. To this protest the Consul replied by a statement, the accuracy of which is certainly open to question, that the practice had existed for forty years, and had been accepted by the Sultan. Further correspondence ensued,the Sultan pressing his protest and the Erench Consul main taining his contention that only Erench officers could interfere with dhows carrying Erench flags. In 1899 the Sultan wrote to the then Erench Appendix No. 22. Qonsul at Muscat informing him that he did not recognize the right of Erance to exercise juris diction over his subjects residing in or visiting his dominions, whether they were in possession of Erench papers or not, and that the practice of granting Erench protection to his subjects at Sur was contrary to the Declaration of 1862 [ante, p. 8), and at the same time he also wrote to the head of theJennebeh tribe at Sur recommending them to return their Erenoh flags, and adopt the original red Arab flag. Eollowing up the policy indicated in His Highness' communication to the Erench Consul in 1899, the Sultan, in June 1900, paid a visit to Sur, and there conferred with the chief men of Sur and those of his subjects there who Appendix No. 23. held Erench flags and papers. The result of the Conference was a written undertaking signed by [1413] Dt 16 these persons to return any French flags held by them at the beginning of the coming year. This undertaking was formally accepted by the Sultan, who, on the 15th June, 1900, issued a notification warning his subjects against taking flags and papers from foreign Governments whereunder they claimed so-called protection. Pour sets of Prench papers were at once surrendered; copies of these ships' papers surrendered on this occasion are given in the Appendix. Their examination discloses the following facts:— No. A is called a which indicates that the applicant, Rashid-bin-Khamis, must have had papers before and let them lapse; otherwise the Consul would have endorsed the papers 'prolongation' as appears to have been done two years later at Zanzibar. Moreover, the place of residence is omitted, though its insertion is clearly required by Articles XXXII and XXXIV of the Brussels Act. No. B contains no proper description of the vessel to distinguish it from the numerous Arab dhows bearing the same common name and of the same tonnage. In this Hire also the proteges' residence is omitted. The proprietor is stated to be also proprietor of the ' Saad-el-Kerim,' which may refer to another vessel with French papers, but affords no sufficient indication of qualification to hold Erench papers. No. 0, like No. B, contains no indication of the residence of the ship-owner, and merely states that he is owner of another vessel—the ' Saad-al- Kerim.' No. D describes the owner as resident in a place somewhat illegibly written but appearing to be Mitsa Mixxote, declared by the owner to be the name of one of the Comoro Islands. His actual residence was at Suweik, a small port on the Batineh coast of Oman. It is further to be observed that these Utres were all granted or renewed by French Consuls at Muscat or Zanzibar, and not by the officers of French Colonies or Protectorates; and it is also to be noted that the titre permits the employ ment of a foreign crew, which militates against any contention that the crew can be considered as French proteges. At the time of the Sultan's visit to Sur all the Suri vessels except one were laid up in harbour for the monsoon season, and though at least those owned by the persons in the list given in the Appendix No. 8.

Appendix No. 27. 17 Appendix No. 14 claimed to sail under the FrencTi flag, only fifteen or sixteen had on them any names or numbers as required by Article XXXIV of the Brussels Act, and on even these vessels the names were not inlaid, as required., but so dis posed on the quarter tbat they could be easily removed or erased. The Erenoh titres above referred to were sent by the Sultan to M. Ottavi, who declined to receive them, and visited Sur to inquire into the circumstances attending their surrender. On the 26th June, 1900, M. Cambon, the French Ambassador in London, gave to the British Minister of Foreign Affairs an assurance that do certificates would be recognized which had been granted for the first time to subjects of the Sultan after that date, and that the existing papers would be carefully examined. On the 11th February, 1902, by the direction of the British Government, the British Consul at Muscat addressed to M. Laronce, then French Consul there, a protest against the assertion of any claim by France ' to exercise jurisdiction in Muscat territory and territorial waters over certain born and domiciled Omani subjects of His Highness, to whom French flags and tifres de navigation had been issued' by officials of the French Government. This protest was evoked by official communica tions made by the French Consul on the 14ith and 23rd January, 1902, in which he claimed to exercise jurisdiction over certain Omatiis on the strength of their possessing French flags and papers. The text of the correspondence is given in the Appendix. In the final letter the French Consul wrote— ' Ni moi ni le Commandant Kiesel n'avons I'intention de soumettre des sujets de I'Oman ^ la juridiction Frai)?aise : nous revendiquons eeulement le droit que nous confere 1'Acte de Bruxelles, c'est-a-dire un droit de surveillance et de police sur les boutriers qui portent notre pavilion.' Upon this statement it is necessary to observe that the Consul places reliance, not upon the Treaty of 1844, upon which his jurisdiction over Omani subjects, so far as it exists, depends, but upon the Act of Brussels, as conferring a right of surveillance and police in the waters and terri tories of another Power which is not a party to [1413] ^ 2 ! ^EggMIIIIH II18 Appendix No. 29. Appendix No. 30. that Act. And it will be seen on reference to the Brussels Act that Article XLII especially reserves the national jurisdiction in the territorial waters of every State. As the result of the inquiries and investigations made by the Agents of the French Governments M. Cambon, the French Ambassador in London, Appendix No. 28. made, on the 14tli August, 1901, a statement expressing the view^s of the French Government on the question. This statement was referred to the British Consul at Muscat for report, and the substance of his B-eport was embodied in a statement made by Lord Lansdowne to M. Cambon on the 16th April, 1902. The exchanges of view, which then took place were of an unofficial nature, but it was understood that there was no desire on the part of the French Government to interfere in any way with the Sultan of Muscat. From that date for a time the controversy rested. But in the year 1903 two events happened which ultimately revived the controversy and conduced to the present arbitration. Abdulla-bin-Salem, Chief of the Gafiri Arabs, resident at Sur, was engaged in a tribal war with a section of another Arab tribe. Finding that his opponents were receiving supplies through Sur, the Chief levied a fine on the town, and forbade native vessels to leave until the Headmen had paid the fine. Mubarak-bin-Hamed Eazaiki owned a dhow, for which he had taken out papers in the name of his son, Khamis-bin-Mubarak, and flew the French flag. Both he and his son were residents in Sur, and subjects of the Sultan. To avoid his tribal liability, Mubarak expressed his intention of taking his ship out, and on his persisting some Appendix No. si. of Abdulla-bin-Salem's men fired on the vessel, and a shot went through the flag. This incident was made the ground of a claim by the French Consul on the Sultan for an indemnity of 1,500 dols. The claim was chal lenged by the British Consul and was withdrawn or postponed. On the 8th April, 1903, the British mail steamer ' Chindwara,' from Bombay, arrived off Muscat, having on board, among other passengers, five Arabs, all natives of and residents at Sur. Their names were :— 1. Scieed-lin-Mubarak-hin-Ilashid) oi ihQ'E&amp;xis Appendix No. 32. section of the Jennebeh tribe.19 2. Mosallin-bin-SultcLYi) of tlie Mukanna section of the same tribe. 3. Ahdulla-hin^KJiamis-hin-Ali, of the same sec tion of the same tribe. 4. Salem-bin-Abdulla-bin-Khamis, sou of No. 3. 5. Khalfan-bin-Hamed-bin-Muhammed Wad Belan, of the same section of the same tribe as No. 3. Bombay being an infected port, the ship was subjected to the quarantine laws of the Sultan of Muscat. Nos. 1 and 2, who were deck passengers, on landing were sent to Haramal, the Sultan's quarantine station, about 3 miles from Muscat. Nos. 3, 4, ai^d5, who were second-class passen gers, were not sent to the quarantine station, but were allowed by the Sultan's Health Officers to go on shore, under orders to report daily at the hospital for one week for medical inspection. No. 4 offered money to Ali Salman, the Sultan's Quarantine Superintendent, not to send Nos. 1 and 2 to the quarantine station. On the 9th April, Nos. 3, 4, and 5 came to the hospital, and, after medical inspection, said: 'We want to go away to-day,' but Ali Salman said to them: ' It is impossible ; wait and see if the doctor will let you go a day or two before the time.' On the same evening these three men hired a badan, and sailed away in it without leave at dusk in company with Khamis-bin-Mubarak Razeiki and two askaris, besides the master and crew. The vessels did not fly the Prench flag, and belonged to Taiwi, a port in Oman, between Muscat and Sur. About 8 p.m. Nos. 1 and 2 escaped from the quarantine station, and joined the badan at Bunder Jisseh, seven miles from Muscat, on the morning of the 10th April. Their escape was reported by the Superintendent of the quarantine station, and led to the discovery that Nos. 3, 4, and 5 had also escaped. The Sultan, on learning of the breach of quaran tine, communicated with his Health Officer and with Major Cox, the British Consul, and the latter, on the joint request of the Sultan and his Health Officer (the Sultan at that date not having any steam-vessel of his own), applied to the captain of His Majesty's ship ' Perseus' for the use of a steam-launch to pursue the badan. The launch travelled down the coast with the Super- intendent of the quarantine station on board, and ultimately sighted the badan near Eas Abu Daud.20 The vessel ran ashore, and the five Arabs were arrested on the shore and taken back to Muscat. The crow and the other passengers on the badan were not interfered with. On the arrival of the five Arabs at Muscat, they were taken before the Health Officer, who resides at the British Consulate, and at the request of the Sultan were detained in the guard room of the Consulate during the night of the 10th April, and on the 11th April the Sultan wrote to Major Cox thanking him for the capture of the Arabs, and asking for their further detention at the Consulate. On the same day they were handed over to officers of the Sultan and taken back to the quarantine, station to complete their term of detention. Before their departure, Major Cox, at the written request of the Sultan, had taken the statements of all five Arabs and of the Sultan's Quarantine Superintendent, which are printed in the Appendix. On the same day the French Consul, M. Dor- ville, wrote to Major Cox complaining of the imprisonment by him of three French proteges who had contravened the Quarantine .Regulations. Major Cox replied that five Suri subjects of the Sultan had broken quarantine, and that M. Dor- ville should address himself to their Sovereign. M. Droville, on the same day, claimed from the Sultan release of three of these Arabs (Nos, 3, 4, and 5) as being Suris under French protection. The Sultan replied on the 12th April, stating his intention to punish the five Arabs for breaking quarantine, and repeating his protest against the contention that the French flag covered any of his subjects while on his territory or territorial waters, and saying that he would be content to have the question settled by discussion and decision of Great Britain and France. On the 15th April the Sultan tried the five Arabs for breaking quarantine and sentenced them to three months J imprisonment. The Sultan's action was challenged by the French Consul and the Commander of the French war-ship et Infernet,' and was supported by the British Government; and after discussion between the British and the French Governments, the questions raised by the incident were ultimately referred to the arbitrament of the Tribunal by the Compromis printed at p. 1 of this Case. Another matter later in date than the affair of the quarantine-breakers also raises questions which oall for the decision of the Tribunal. V - (jj 0 rKOtu , O«, dl !

Salim-bin-Mahomed, the owner of the dhow referred to in the titre referred to as D. on p. 16 of this Case, was, as there stated, resident at Suweik, and was the only holder of a Erench flag at that place. He died about the year 1902. On being informed of his death, Laronce, the French Consul at Muscat, asked the Sultan of Muscat to instruct his Vali at Suweik to see that the effects of the deceased should not be made away with, and thereby afforded ground for inferring that the French Consular authorities claimed to control or supervise the administration of the estate of the deceased. In 1904 a collision between two dhows occurred in the harbour of Debai, in the territories of the trucial Chief Sheikh Maktoon. The result of the collision was the destruction of a dhow, the ' ^ath-ul-Khair, ,, bearing the same name as the vessel referred to in the titre D. already mentioned. The destroyed vessel bore the French flag, and was owned by Ali-bin-Salim, of Suweik, sou of the deceased Salim-bin-Mahomed. Certain questions arose as to the responsibility for the destruction of the vessel, which were settled by an Award of the religious Court of Sultan Mal^toop,. But the French Consul made re presentations to the Sultan of Muscat, apparently on the assumption that Ali-bin-Salim was a French protege, and on inquiry it was ascertained that, on the death of his father, Ali-bin-Salim, had succeeded to his father's vessel, and had used the French flag thereon, and that on the destruction of the vessel he had hoisted the French flag on another vessel acquired as a substitute. On the 11th April, 1903, the Sultan of Muscat requested M. Dorville, then French Consul at Muscat, to furnish him with a list of the names of those persons whom the French Government !. claimed to protect in the Sultan's territories, explaining in each case upon what the right of the individuals to be considered under French protection was based. This request was refused, but on the 13 th May, 1908, at an interview with Lord Lansdowne, M. Cambon, the French Ambassador in London, said that the French Government had been quite ready to fallin with the British suggestion to the effect that a list of persons possessing French flags should be prepared, and that such a list had, in fact, been made out and would have been delivered to the Sultan when the quarantine incident arose. {* 22 Up to the date of the filing of this Case such lists have not been delivered, but the French Government have undertaken to include such lists in the Case to be submitted on the part of France, and the British Government reserve their rights as to examining and verifying them. ^ The delivery of such lists would enable His ^ ^ y ■ Highness the Sultan to obtain an examination and written explanation of the grounds on which each litre de navigation or flag was given, and /fj \ jl I W57 Y-^- to indicate to the French Government the cases 5|k[j ^ in which its officers had been induced, by mis- -— ^ statements as to the nationality and real domicile ^ ft' * ^ \ V r of the flagholder, to grant such tifres and flags ^ ^ ^ to subjects of the Sultan who had no title to v &amp; Qut ^ jl - ux become French protSqes. I AJU aJLRuej &lt;5^ ^0018 23 ARGUMENT. The facts above stated indicate the acts by Trench officials which form the ground of com plaint by the Sultan and the British Government. It remains to consider their juridical quality. The Sultan of Muscat, like every other inde pendent Sovereign, is entitled to police his own territorial waters for the enforcement of his own laws and to secure compliance with his Treaties with foreign Powers, and this sovereign right includes that of enforcing Quarantine Regulations and suppressing the Slave Trade. In the absence of special Conventions, no foreign Power is entitled to exercise any police powers at all in the Sultan's waters; and the Sultan is further, as an independent Sovereign, entitled to exercise full jurisdiction over all persons within his terri tory, except so far as by Treaty, usage, or sufferance he has conceded to a foreign State the privilege of exterritoriality for its subjects or for persons whom he recognizes as proteges of such foreign Power. Among Christian Powers the privilege of ex territoriality is conceded only in favour of the Heads of foreign States, their Diplomatic Repre sentatives, and foreign public vessels. In the case of Oriental Powers in Asia and Africa, Capitulations and Treaties have been made with Christian Powers, admitting within the ter ritories of such Oriental Powers a special Con sular jurisdiction over subjects of the Christian Power there resident, and, de litre gracieux, over subjects of other Christian Powers which have no Consuls in the Oriental State, and also to a qualified and varying extent over the subjects of the Oriental Power in the service of subjects of such Christian Power. The history of the privileges of the latter class has to a very great extent been a history of their abuse, and in the Ottoman Empire—the most considerable of the Mussulman States— the rights of a Christian Power to take Ottoman subjects under its protection were restricted by Regulations of 1863 and 1865, fully accepted by Christian Powers as constituting the reasonable limits for such protection; [1413] Ey 24 and the concurrence of the chief Powers of Europe in this view is fully expressed in Article IX of the Treaty of Peace between Turkey and Greece of tha 22nd November '4th December), 1897, and in the Award made on the 21st March, 1901, with respect to the subject of protection by Greece in the Ottoman Empire. The rights of France in Muscat, as defiaed by the Treaty of 1844, are limited to the protection of French citizens there, and of Omani subjects, who are actually in the service of such French citizens, and do not confer on the Consuls of France any jurisdiothn over any subject of the Sultan who is not actually and bond fide in French service in Muscat. By reading the most -favoured-nation clause of the Treaty of 1814 with the terms of the British Treaty of 1891, France may be considered as entitled to include among her proteges in Muscat— 1. Inhabitants of territories in Africa or the Indian Seas which are French Protectorates, lond fide domiciled and subject there and to the extent specified in the Treaties, bond fide servants of French subjects, provided that such natives were subjects of the protected States at the time when the Protectorate was established, and were domiciled in these States. 2. Subjects of non-Christian Powers, not having a Consulate in Muscat, who are actually in the service of French citizens in Muscat. To the extent above stated, and no further, do the Treaties derogate from the recognized rule of international law that one State is not entitled to extend its protection over the subjects of another, except— 1. In its own territories and territorial waters. 2. Elsewhere, with the assent of the Sovereign of the protected person. The Muscat Treaty of 1844 contains no sur render of the Sultan's right of police over his waters, and grants no right to France to exercise that police. The only privilege with respect to French vessels is that contained in Article X of the Treaty, which accords them the treatment of the most favoured nation in the ports of Muscat, and the terms of this concession do not involve the right to break the Sultan's Quarantine Regulations or to carry on the Slave Trade in the Sultan's territory or territorial waters. The qualified grant of extra-territorial rights which is conceded by the Treaty is a concession to Appendix No. 36. / v &gt; &gt; 925 the difference between 'Western and Eastern con ceptions of law and justice, and is not in any way intended to enable France to interfere between the Sultan and his own subjects in any case not specifically provided for in the Treaty. And the text of the Treaty has not been supplemented, varied, or enlarged in this respect by any recognised or established usage, permitting France to exercise either concurrent or exclusive jurisdiction over the Sultan's subjects in his terri tories or in his territorial waters. On the 19th May, 1903, the French Ambassador in London stated to Lord Landsdowne ' that the Treaty of 1844 was not designed to meet the case of those owners of dhows whose rights, he said, were in many cases anterior to the date of the Treaty: that the French flagholders were altogether outside the Treaty, and that protection was claimed for them not under the Treaty, but because they had been given French papers and were entitled to fly the French flag.' It is difficult to comprehend the principle upon which such a claim could be based. It involves an assertion of the right of France spontaneously to create as many porteges as it chooses in Muscat by grant of French papers and flags to any foreigner who applies for them, and as it admittedly does not rest on any specific Treaty with Muscat, the claim is equally applicable to the subjects of any European Power in the territories of their natural Sovereign—a contention which no civilised State would for a single moment admit. In truth the contention seems to be based on a confusion of ideas and a mistaken notion that Christian Powers are entitled in Oriental States to create classes of protected Orientals without reference to any Treaty or Capitulation, and to force on the Rulers of those States, with respect to their own subjects, the municipal laws of France. It is not admissible in the case of Muscat to base any claim to French protection on the fact that the protege has acquired a domicile on French territory, which is not the equivalent of nation ality, or that he has acquired immeuhles in a French Colony or Protectorate. The maritime laws of France appear not to con template the grant of French papers to vessels unless at least half the vessel is owned by French citizens. And Article XXXII of the Brussels Act cannot be interpreted as extending or giving any26 wider scope to these laws. That Article recognizes the principle that it would be an abuse to grant the national flag indiscriminately to native vessels, and operates to restrict internationally the right of Powers which have accepted it to cover by their flag native craft in the Indian Seas, and is obviously aimed at preventing the very mischief created by the practices detailed on pp. 10-14 of this Case. In other words, the aim of the Article was to insure that no native vessel should fly the flag of a Signatory Power unless it satisfied the, conditions laid down in the Article, and that natiye vessels which were not qualified for registration, by reason of the status of their owners as actual subjects or bond fide proteges of a Signatory Power, should have to resort to the flag of any of the native States to which their owners belonged. The effect of the action of Prench officials has been to enable Arabs of independent States or tribes not belonging to any Prench Colony or Protecto rate under cover of the Prench flag to claim the right to escape on the high seas from search under Article XL 11 of the Brussels Act, and in the waters, or in the territory, of the State to which they belonged, notwithstanding the saving clause in that Article, to claim extra-territoriality and independence of their own lawful Sovereign, and to defeat his efforts to enforce his own laws and Treaty obligations to suppress their nefarious occupation. The saving clause in Article XLII of the Brussels Act expresses the universally established rule of international law as to the jurisdication of a State within its own territorial waters. It cannot be contended that Prance, by reserving her assent to the Article, has given herself larger powers of police and surveillance in the waters of other States than would be acquired by those Powers which have accepted Article XLII, and it is to be further noted that Muscat not being a party to the Brussels Act, Prance cannot, by virtue of these Articles of the Act which she has accepted, claim the exercise of any rights in the dominions or territorial waters of the Sultan, whose obligations, always fully recognized to sup press the Slave Trade, are defined by the Treaties with Great Britain already referred to, and not by the Brussels Act. The terms of the second paragraph of Article XXXII of the Act are inconsistent with the practice of granting permits at Prench Consulates in foreign00189 27 States because the proof of possession of immeubles there referred to clearly relates to immeuhles within the territory and jurisdiction of the Trench authority granting the permits which cannot exist in foreign States in which the Trench only have Consulates. Assuming, for the purposes of the present Case, that by the grant of Trench papers to the Omani owner of an Arab dhow the vessel and the recipient of the papers acquire privileges and incur obligations within Trench waters, and those rights depend solely on Trench municipal law. No such rights can be recognized in the high seas as a fortiori so soon as the vessel and its owner and crew return within the territorial waters of Muscat there is nothing in the recognized rules of international law or in the Treaties . ;.u» which renders the vessel, entitled to privileges as a Trench vessel, or its owner, captain, and crew entitled to be treated as proteges. Where the title of the Omani owner to fly the Trench flag is questioned by his Sultan, it is not enough for a Trench official to assert that the man is a protege, or to show that he or his ship is re gistered at the Consulate or has Trench papers. The claim to privilege must be warranted by the facts and brought within the relevant Treaty. The papers of many of these vessels contain a clause permitting the vessel td be manned by foreigners, which has the effect of displacing any presumption which might otherwise have arisen that the crew of such a vessel under the Trench flag were Trenchmen, and makes it necessary in each case to show that members of the crew were independently of the litre either Trench- men or natives of Trench Colonies or Protector ates, or in the service of Trenchmen. Great respect is, of course, due to the declara tion of a responsible officer of Trance with respect to persons claimed as Trench proteges. But subjects of Oman who claim such a privilege or exemption must prove that ^they are entitled to it under some Treaty, and when the facts of their I birth, nationality, residence, and occupation are i perfectly well established, it is impossible that such facts can be countervailed by a declaration \that they are registered in the Trench Consulate or have obtained Trench papers while outside Oman. The only result of such a declaration is to entitle the Sultan to invite Trance immediately to28 inyestigate the circumstances under wliich her officials have permitted unqualified persons to obtain the semblance of being Prench citizens or 'proteges, and to have the claimants at once struck off any Consular register on which they appear, and deprived of any French flags or papers which they have wrongfully obtained. In the case of a claim by a native of a country to be a, protege of a foreign Power, the presumption is against such privilege, and the officers of the protecting State, while they may be able to say that they have regis tered the claimant or done acts purporting to give him protection, must go further, and show in what quality and under what Treaty or principle of international law the claim can be justified. To admit the absolute right of a foreign State to conclude by its declaration the question whether any person was, or was not, its protege, would enable it to transfer to its pro tection masses of a foreign population residing in their own country, and to create semi-independent communities within the borders of a friendly State. Indeed, this is precisely what has resulted at Sur from the action of French officials in Muscat, and constitutes a grave attack upon the independence of the Sultan of Muscat. The claim advanced on 'behalf of the quaran tine-breakers—which has directly led to this arbi tration is even less justifiable. The men did not arrive at Muscat under the French flag, and did not run away from their quarantine in a vessel flying the French flag. The sole ground of the privilege claimed was that they had at some time sailed in such a vessel or obtained French papers in connection with such a vessel. They were con fessedly Suri subjects of the Sultan resident in his dominions. A claim by the subject of a European Power to defy the Quarantine Regulations of his own State on the ground that he owned, or had sailed in, a ship registered in France would at once be scouted as inconsistent with every principle alike of municipal and international law, and in the absence of a Treaty with Muscat specifically varying the ordinary rules of jurisdiction, the claim has no juridical foundation. Upon the facts and arguments hereinbefore stated, it is submitted on behalf of Great Britain00190 @ and the Sultan of Muscat that the Tribunal should come to the following y W -i\SLrys.eXu {JV^UJtlA O-TyvG^ (y^GLb^ 9 ■ - ^ ($&gt;v CC ul 6\sl '.'--W..

No subject of the Sultan of Muscat acquires any right to the status of a Erench protege under the Treaty of 1844! by the fact that he is the owner, captain, or a member of the crew of a native vessel which has, by whatever means, obtained French papers or flag. 2. By her adhesion to the XXXIInd Article of the Brussels Act of 1890, Prance is under an international obligation not to grant Prench flags or papers to any native vessel unless its owner, at the time of grant, is (a) a French citizen, or is (5) a French protege by reason of his being a subject of a State under French protection. 3. France is equally debarred by the Declara tion of 1862 from withdrawing any subject of the Sultan of Muscat from the jurisdiction of the Sultan by the grant of French flags or papers, and the practice which prevailed up to June 1900 of making such grants trenches on the indepen dence of the Sultan. 4. No subject of the Sultan, by accepting French papers or flags, acquires any immunity from the Sultan's jurisdiction in the territories or territorial waters of Oman either for himself or for the crew of any ship commanded or owned by him or for any member of his family or for any of his employes. 5. On the death of the owner of a vessel in respect of which a French titre de navigation has been granted, no right accrues to his heirs, as such, to treat the vessel as qualified to fly the French flag^ The question in each case is one of personal status. 6.

Such subjects shall enjoy, immediately and unconditionally, throughout the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Muskat, with respect to commerce, shipping, and the exercise of trade, as in every other respect, all the rights, privileges, immunities, advantages, and protection of whatsoever nature, which are, or hereafter may be, enjoyed by, or accorded to, the subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation. _ _ &gt; They shall, more especially, not be liable to other or more onerous duties, imposts, restrictions, or obligations of whatever description, than those to which subjects or citizens of the most favoured nation now are, or hereafter may be, subjected, ARTICLE III. V The two High Contracting Parties acknowledge reciprocally to each other the right of appointing Consuls to reside in each other's dominions wherever the interests of commerce may require the presence of such officers; and such Consuls shall at all times be placed, in the country in which they reside, on the footing of the Consuls of the most favoured nations. Each of the High Contracting Parties further agree to permit his own subjects to be appointed to Consular offices by the other Con tracting Party, provided always that the persons so appointed shall not begin to act without the previous approbation of the Sovereign whose subjects they may be. The public tunetionaries of either Government residing in the dominions of the other, shall enjoy the same privileges, immunities, and exemptions which are enjoyed within the same dominions by similar public functionaries of other countries.

This duty, once paid, shall cover, from all other charges on the part of His Highness the Sultan, goods of whatever description coming from foreign countries by sea, whether these are intended f ^r local consunaption or for transmission elsewhere in bulk or otherwise, and whether they remain in the state in which they are imported or have been manufactured. fetr There shall, however, be exempted from payment of all duty the following, namely :— 80 as 1. All goods and merchandize which, being destined for a foreign port, are transhipped from one vessel to another in any of the ports of His Highness the Sultan of Muskat, or which have been Ij for this purpose provisionally landed and deposited in any of the Sultan's Custom-houses to tie si await^ the arrival of a vessel in which to be reshipped abroad. But goods and merchandize so sod landed shall be exempted only, provided that the consignee or his agent shall have, on the arrival P 0 8sil of the ship, handed over the said goods to' be kept under Customs seal, and declared them as ^ 1 Wd* offiali v oom ^ * .JT' 87 lauded for transhipment, designafcing- at the same time the foreign port o£ destination, and also provided that the said goods are actually shipped for the said foreign port as originally declared, within a period not exceeding six months after their first lauding, aud without having, in the interval, changed owners. 2. All goods and merchandize which, not being consigned to a port within the dominions of the Sultan, have been inadvertently landed, provided that such goods are reshipped withiu a month of being so landed and transported abroad. Should, however, such goods or merchandize, here spoken of, be opened or removed from the custody of the Customs authorities, the full duty shall then be payable on the same. 3. Coals, naval provisions, stores and fittings, the property of Her Majesty's Government, landed in the dominions of His Highness for the use of the ships of Her Majesty's navy. 4. All goods and merchandise transhipped or landed for the repair of damage caused by stress of weather or other disaster at sf-a, provided the cargo so discharged shall be reshipped and taken away on board of the same vessel, or it the latter shall have been condemned, or her departure delayed, in 'any other manner.

It shall be at the option of the British subject in each case to pay the percentage duties stipulated in Article VI, either in cash, or, if the nature of the goods allows of it, in kind, by giving up an equivalent amount of the goods or produce. In the event of payment being made in cash, the value of the merchandize, goods, or produce on which duty is to be levied, shall be fixed according to the ready-money market price ruling at the time when the duty is levied. ^ In the case of foreign imports, the value shall be fixed according to the market price at Muskat, and in that of native goods and produce by the market price at the place where the merchant shall choose to pay the duty. In the event of any dispute arising between a British subject and the Custom-house authorities regarding the value of such goods, this shall be determined by reference to two experts, each party nominating one, and the value so ascertained shall be decisive. Should, however, these experts not be able to agree, they shall choose an umpire, whose decision is to be considered final. ARTICLE X.

APPENDIX No. 4. The Marquess of Salisbury to the Earl of Lytton. My nT?^ T Foreign Office, October 29, 1888. ment the faot . r ^ ues ^ e ^. -^g^on to bring to the notice of the French Govern- French flae- off fhp existence of a considerable Trade in Slaves on board vessels flying the On tS L Go a s t of Afraa, and to urge them to take steps to remedy the abuse. On the 26th ultimo he reported that orders had already been sent, as notified in the 'Temps' of\ 41 the 16th ultimo, to the French Admiral on the East Coast to take active steps against all vessels found to be engaged in the Slave Trade, under whatever flag. Acting under instructions, Your Lordship, on the 24th instant, expressed the satisfaction of Her Majesty s Government that some steps were being taken, and remarked on the regrettable absence of any Slave Trade Treaty between this country and France empowering them to exercise the right of search over suspected vessels belonging to either country. The papers named in the margin, of which copies are now inclosed, give further details of the extent which the protection afforded under existing circumstance* by the French flag is abused on the, East Coast of Africa. Unfortanitely, the evil is not merely of recent growth, though intensified by f ie facilities^ afforded to native craft of obtaining the french flag by the extension of French influence in Madagas car and tlie Comoro Islands. To go no further back, in 1380 and 1S81 the question had been the subject of correspondence , between the two Governments, and in December of the latter year Captain Brownrigg, of Her Majesty's ship &gt;e Landon, ' was kill-d by Arabs on board a dnoW wh-ch was carrying slaves under l^ench colours. Her Majesty's Government then brought before the French Government the urgent necessity for Her Majesty's ships being temp warily permitted to search dhows carrying , French colours, but thong i they received the greatest sympathy and though special measures were adopted by the French naval authorities on the spot, the French Government expressed themselves unable^ for reasons given in M. Gambetta's note to Lord Lyons of the 1 nth December, 1?. 82 to grant the desired permission. The instance quoted at page 342 ( of the Hlue Book on Slave Trade affairs issued in 18H2 of a French dhow being seized in Zmzibar Harbour with 100 slaves on board, with correct papers signed by the French Consul on the morning of the day she was taken, gave a striking proof of the facility of abuses even at that time. The correspondence which appeared in the Blue Books for 1H86 and 1«87 showed the existence of irregularities in the labour traffic between Madagascar and Reunion, which amounted to a regular Trade in Slaves, and the ease with which such abuses could be carried on, and the conclusion is unavoidable that the immunity from search enjoved by vessels under the French flag is an encouragement to slavers to carry on the Traffic by sea, and consequently tends to a development of the Trade on land, which, apart from its inherent atrocity, devastates and depopulates a country which the nations of Europe are now earnestly endeavouring to open up to Christianity and civilization. Her Majesty's Government are fully alive to the necessity of securing vessels carrying on legitimate commerce on the coasts of Africa as well as elsewhere from undue and vexatious interference on the part of vesse's of their own or any other nationality, but the 'treaties into which th *y have entered with other nations for the suppression of tne Slave Trade have rarely ^led to any grave difficulties, whilst they have been proved to exercise a most beneficial deterrent effect. The limited powers conferred upon the naval officers of France and England by the agreement recorded in the Instructions of 1888 have unfortunately proved insufficient, and it must be contrary to the wish of the French Government that their strict observance should confer immuniry upon persons who are guilty of practices condemned by every civilized nation of the world. I have therefore to request that Your Excellency will furnish the French Government with a copy of this despatch, and will express to them the hope of Her Majesty's Government that they will consent to entir into an arrangement by whici the cruisers of the two Powers may respectively be empowered to exercise the right of search and detention, when necessary, over sailing-vessels flyino- the flag of either country and navigating in the waters between the East Coast of Africa and the islands adjacent, namely, the Comoros and Madagascar.

Admiraltyy Octoler 15, 1888, Sir, I AM commanded by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to transmit, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the accompanying copy of a communication from the Commander-in-Chief of the East Indian station, with inclosure from the commanding officer of Her Majesty's ship ' Griffon,' having reference to the proceedings of a native vessel, flying the French flag, engaged in the Slave Trade. I am, &amp;c,, (Signed) EVAN MACGREGOfi.J 42 Inclosure No. 2. Commander Blaxland to Bear'Admiral Fremantle. g.^ ' Griffon at Zanzibar, September, 4, 1888. ' IN compliance with section 4. o£ Article 130 o£ the Station Orders, I have the hononr to report that Lientenant Myles H. Cooper, of Her Majesty's ship nnder my command, bw informed me^hat while cruising in the OlgaV off the Island of Pemha on t ie 49 th ultimo, ^ » dhow standing in towards Kokota Gan. On appr aching her he saw she^ was flying French *nc\ hailed her to heave to. This she refused to do until two blank rifle charges had been fired across her bows. On visiting her Mr. Cooper found she had French papers, vistd the 80th July 1888, and from them he gained the following information Name of dhow,' Bittila'; captain, Mahomet; owner, Attomon Abdallahj port to which belonging, Mayotta. The captain said he was from Zanzibar, having left that place on the 28th August. Ker papers appeared to be genuine ; she was not detaiued or searched. She had thirty or more Ara^ and crew, a large number of whom had rifles. 2 Mr Cooper also informs me that he noticed that the dhow had four heads, a very large crallev' and a laro-e quantity of slave food and firewood, and suspecting she was engaged in the Slave Trade, and actually had slaves on board, he dispatched the whaler to observe where she anchored and ordered Abdallah, one of our interpreters, to land and watch her proceedings. She anchored'in Port Kinyu, and the whaler, having landed the interpreter, returned to the ' 01ga/ , Ihe interpreter returned some hours after and reported that he had watched her proceedings from a tree, and that between 6 and 9 p.m . she landed seventy-five slaves. When all had been t ashore the crew of the dhow marched them off to Tongoni, where a slave was held. Seventy- three were taken to Wadi, a place -in the centre of Pemba, and two were purchased by an Arab named Sadi Benzar. living at Hnga. The interpreter, in support of his statement, brought three witnesses with him, viz., a domestic slave and a native called Hamfi, who were up the tree with him and an Arab named Ali Benahomed, who lives at Tongoni, 5 - I have, &amp;c., (Signed) J. E. BLAXLAND. Forwarded, observing that I considered this Report of such importance as to render advisable my telegraphing the substance of it in my telegram of the 5th September, 1888. I would add that I have it from other sources that the brench flayr is unblushingly made use of to cover a nefarious Traffi ' in Slaves, generally earriei on, no do ibt, by Arabs in native dhow 5 , with which we are'^ p &gt;werless to interfere; but no such clear case as the one reported has hitherto been brought to my notice. The reports to which I allude are as follows It has been reported by the Captain of a German man-of-war that he has seen five French dhows which he believed to have beea slavers, sail from Bindi on the same day. I have it also from high native authority that in July last a cargo of 200 slaves was openly landed at Mayotta in the Comoro Islands (I may remark that the dhow now referred to belonged to that port) by a vessel flying French colours. We have also the reports from the Vice-Consul at Majunga which have been forwarded t 1 me through the Admiralty, the last dated the 21st Ma'ch, 18 »8, in which it is stated that over 7 0 slaves were recently landed on the west of Madagascar, presumably br dhows under the French flag, and hQ calls for a British man-of-war, which, I fear, would be of little service. The present case is such a clear one that it can no longer be denied that the French flag is made use of as stated, and I trust that, on this being pointed out to the French Government, they will take energetic steps to stop the Traffic, Should the French Government be desirous of supporting Cardinal Lavigerie's crusade and discouraging the Slave Trade, I would suggest that the ri^ht of vi-dt and search should be granted to our officers to board dhows or native cratt flying French colours, and that, should slaves be found on board, the vessel should be given up to the nearest French Consular or naval authority to be dealt with Unless some such pleasures are taken it is certain that we are only beating the wind in capturing occasional Arab dhows, when the protection of the French flag is given to slavers who can carry on the Traffic with impunity. I would remark that it is absolutely necessary to visit these French dhows, as the remark in section 8, p. 273, of the Slave Trade Instructions, as to the ' numerous indications which, apait from the colours, are sufficient to show to the practised eye of a seaman the nationality of a vessel/' is obviously inapplicable. The steps taken by Lieutenant Myles H. Cooper to ascertain beyond doubt the character of the vpssel, and the courage of the interpreter Abdallah in obtaining it, have received my warm approval.

IN continuation of my telegram of the 6tli instant, informing Your Lordship that Hear Admiral Fremantle proposed to send a gun-boat to Madagascar with orders to cruise for slave vessels and to show the British flag iu all ports, and inquiring whether Your Lordship would entertain any objection to this project, I have the honour to state that my telegram above referred to was dispatched at the special request of the Commander-in-Chief himself, who w shtd to be informed whether there were any political reasons in connection with the French occupation of Madagascar which would render the presence of a British man-of-war in its waters undesirable at this juncture. Admiral Fremantle has since received a telegram from the Admiralty authorizing him to dispatch a man-of-war for the purposes stated, and Her Majesty's ship ' f Algerine' accordingly sailed for Madagascar yesterday. It is expected that she will be absent from Zanzibar, for about six weeks. I have, &amp;e., (Signed) C. B. EUAN-SMITH. Inclosure No. 4. Colonel 'Euan-Smith to the Marquess of Salisbury. My Lord, Zanzibar, September 30, 1888. IN continuation of my telegram of the 6th instant, 1 have the honour to forward, for Your Lordship's information, the copy of a letter, with inclosures, received by me from His Excellency Rear-Admiral the Honourable E. R. Fremantle, C.B., C.M.G., reporting the landing at Pemba on the 29th August of seventy-five slaves from an Arab dhow carrying French colours Ihe papers of the dhow were found to. be in perfect order, having been vised by the French authorities as recently as the 30th July, 1888. Immediately on receipt of Admiral Fremantle's letter I communicated with the French Consul, who was good enough to call on me without delay, and to assure me that he had taken all necessary steps to have the dhow and her 'captain captured on their return to Mayotta- 4 M Lacau also informed me that he would address the French Government, begging them to ^ send out a cruiser to the East Coast of Africa in order to put down this illegal Traffic under French colours, though he seemed to doubt whether this request would meet with any success. It seems evident that there is a marked increase in the Slave Traffic carried on under the protection of the French flag. The German Consul-General has informed me that he had received reports from the officials of the German East African Company stationed at Kilwa, Lindi, and other places along the coast, to the effect that dhows carrying French colours were constantly and regularly leaving for the Comoro Island, Mayotta, and Madagascar, loaded with slaves. Bv the courtesy of Dr. Michahelles, I am enabled to forward, for Your Lordship's information, a translation of an official Memorandum addressed by him to the French Consul on this matter. It is unnecessary for me to point out to Your Lordship that the protection of the French flag now accorded to the Arab dhows engaged regularly in the Slave Trade must in the end render entirely nugatory all the efforts of Her Majesty's cruisers to put down this Traffic. The right to fly the French flag is, to my certain knowledge, at the present moment most carefully guarded at Zanzibar. M. Lacau rarely, if ever, accords this right. But it appears that the flag can be obtained with great facility either at Mayotta, Nossi Be, the Comoro Islands, or Madagascar, at all of which places the difficulties regarding the supply of labour are very great and pressing, and at * which it cannot be pretended that the authorities are entirely ignorant of what goes on. It is some considerable time since so grave an instance of protected Slave Traffic as that which I am now reporting has occurred either in Zanzibar, Pemba, or the vicinity. The fact that _ the slaves in question were landed in sight of the boats of Her Majesty's ship ' Griffon,' who were unable to interfere, has had a very undesirable effect. It is almost certain that this successful venture will be followed by others. Should this be the case, for every single slave captured by our cruising boats between the mainland and Pemba, twenty slaves will probably be landed in perfect security under the French flag. At the time when Cardinal Lavigerie is proclaiming throughout Europe the shortcomings of England and of the civilized world in connection with the suppression of the Slave Trade, the immense encouragement accorded thereto by the protection of the French flag cannot be too strongly animadverted upon. It would be beyond my province to attempt to suggest a complete solution of the many and complex political difficulties by which this question, as regards England and France, seems to be surrounded. I would, however, with all respect, propose that, as far as East Africa is concerned, some sort of compromise might be effected. If Her Majesty's cruisers were accorded the rio-ht to board native vessels carrying the French flag, confining their operations solely to * those craft that come strictly under the description of native dhows or native vessels, and if they were empowered to detain all such vessels found carrying slaves and to forward them to the /44 nearest port at which there was a French Consular authority, for the purpose of being adjudicated on by him, the encourasrement—the unlawful encouragement—that is at present accorded to tne Slave Traffic by the carelessness or insouciance of the French local authorities would entirely cease, I would add, in conclusion, that, at my request, His Highness the Sultan dispatched a speoial official to Femba, accompanied by the interpreter and witnesses of Her Majesty s ship (jrirt'on, to endeavour to recover tbe slaves landed and sold by the Arabs in the French dhow, and to capture tbe guilty parties. The transaction having been so very public, I am in hopes that the measures thus taken may have some good results. Trusting that my action may meet with Your Lordship's approval.

Inclosure No. 6. Dr. Michahelles to M. Lacau. (Translation.) Zanzibar, September Vi, 1888. According to information which has reached the German East African Company from its officials in Lindi and Mikindani, a flourishing Slave Trade is being carried on from these places, and, indeed, it is principally by means of dhows under French colours which convey these forbidden commodities! The Arab masters of the dhows cause their vessels to be surveyed in Madagascar by the French authorities, obtain in consequence the right to fly the French flag, and are by this means protected against all supervision by the English men-of-war which cruise in the waters of the Sultanate of Zanzibar for the suppression of the Slave Trade. You will agree with me that this custom of the dhows as hitherto observed leads to a misuse of the French flag, and constitutes a serious obstacle to the suppression of the Slave Trade, which is desired by all the European Governments in common. While having the honour to draw your attention to the state of things thus set forth, and to request your assistance towards the removal of this evil, I take this opportunity, &amp;c. (Signed) G.

Lieutenant Wemyss, the officer in charge of the boat, informed me this morning that at 10 p.m . last night he found the dhow under way proceeding north outside the harbour within Zanzibar territorial waters, and hailed her, demanding that the sail be lowered, which request was refused. He then asked to see the papers, and only received the reply that the nationality was French, together with the exhibition of French colours. He then determined to verify the papers, and went on board, when the captain and another of the crew tried to push him off.i 48 APPENDIX N o . 7.

I AM directed by Viscount Cross to forward, for the information of the Marquess of Salisbury, copy of a letter from the Government of India giving information on the subject of proceedings of the French Consul at Aden in giving French papers and the French flag to native vessels belonging to Muscat territory. The action of the French Consul at Aden appears to the Government of India to amount to an asseition of protection over Oman, and they aro of opinion that the Government of the French Republic should be requested to put u stop to his proceedings. I am, &amp;e., ^ (Signed) A. GOD LEY. Inclosui;e No. 1. The Government of India to Viscount Cross. * My Lord, Simla, June 9, 1891. IT has been reported to us, by the Government of Bombay and by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, that French Consular officers at Aden, Obokh, aud Zanzibar have, on numerous occasions, given French papers and the French flag to native vessels belonging to Sur and other places within the territory of the Sultan of Muscat. p] 2. The correspondence which we have received regarding this matter is inclosed, and is enumerated in the accompanying list. We have asked the Bombay Government and the Resident in the Persian Gulf to send immediately any further information which they may receive. The reports concerning the action of the French Consuls at Obokh and Madagascar require verification. There appears, however, to be no doubt of the fact that the French Consul at Aden has given papers and the French flag to the masters of native vessels the owners of which are subjects of the Saltan of Muscat. 8. The action of the French Consul at Aden appears to us to amount to an assertion of -y, ^ ^ protection over Oman, and we are of opinion that the Government of the French Republic should be requested to put a stop to his proceadings. We observe that, as goon as the General Act of 11 the Brussels Cojiference, 1889-90, comes into force. Article XXXII will opperate directly to 1 prohibit the action now brought to notice. In the meantime, however, as it appears to be contrary to international usage, and as there is reason to believe that Oman native vessels take advaotaye of the authority given to them to fly the French flag, and are, under cover of that flag, engaging in the Slave Tl'ade, we have tel graphed the substance of this despatch to your Lordship.

BU1 Pnn« 2: i In mean r hile A am J 0 solicit aI1 expression of the views of tho Governor-General in ncxl on the point, and to offer the following remarks: It does not appear to be within the power of any nation to extend in time of peace to strangers the special advantages stipulated for ^FraSion' JTlh ^ . aild tllu ? P^dice the rights of third parties. A provisional n auc tion, can hardly be given on less stringent terms than those wh ch are required by the Customs Administration m France, of which the following are believed to be the most important, V I 149 [1413] namely, ownersMp to tlie extent of at least one-half by Fivneluneti, and an equ'page of crew o£ three-fourths French, subject to exceptions in the case of steamers trading to the East. Neither condition appears to have been satisfied in the present case. The flying of the French flag- under an insnfficient authority may obviously lead to very unpleasant international complications. Jurisdiction might be wrongly assumed or wrongly denied. The flag might be used to cover piracy or the Slave Traffic. The granting of certificates, such as the present, must also tend to weaken the position of England in administering the police of the sea. In view of these and other considerations, I am to request that the matter now reported may receive the early consideration of the Government of India. Inclosure No. 3. Brigadier-General Jopp to the Government of Bombay. Aden Residency, March 15, 1891. I HAVE the honour to report, for the information of Government, that it appears that the Acting French Consul here hits been granting French flags and papers to native craft in Aden Harbour. 1 am unable to ascertain if he has any authority for such action, or if such is forbidden under any British law, but apart from the questionable nature of this action, I have to bring to notice how very unadvisahle it is that sueh should be permitted because one, at least, of the vessels was an armed one, and they seem for the most part to belong to Siiris who are, but too frequently, lawless characters, and whenever an opportunity arises take part in the Slave Trade besides committing depredations on the shores of unfrequented places on the African coast. 2.

I fly the French flag by permission, and 1 have my own reasons for doing so, but I do i not care to give them. I have flown this flag for some years, but had lost all my papers, so, on return to Aden this year, I went to the French Consul and went through all the forms again. These forms take some five or six days to complete, and the fees are rupees. In the first instance I paid 45 rupees, and have now had to pay it aoain. I have declared myself a French Bubject, although an inhabitant of Siir.

(Extract.) Bushire, April 6,1891. WITH referenca to Colonel Ross' letter, dated the l^h October, 1890, I bee: to forward copies of letters from the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat, regarding the use of French colours and papers^ as a cover to the importation of slaves, by boats belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat at Svir and other places on the coast of Oman. 2. The first of these letters shows that the Sultan was prepared in November last to demand an explanation from the chief men of Sur, and it does not appear why he has now contented himself with obtaining from them a list of thirteen Nakhodas known to have carried French colours. ^ No doubt the caution which, under the Slave Trade instructions, officers in command of Her Majesty's ships are bound to exercise in dealing with dhows flying the French flag may be fairly urged by the Sultan as justifying care on his part also. The length, however, to which the Political Agent states that His Highness is prepared to carry this prudence amounts not only to an abnegation of all authority over his subjects, explainable perhaps by his anxiety to avoid embroiling himself with them, but to a disregard of Treaty obligations which, if established, would demand serious notice. 3. I have aske 1 the Political Agent to endeavour to obtain further information regarding the grant of French colours aud papers to Omani boats, for at present there does not 'seem to be sufficient evidence on which to base any formal reference to the French Government. Still, if these boats do possess French papers—and this is a point which the Sultan should have no difficulty in verifying^—it would seem that the assurances of the French Commodore, mentioned in the Naval Commander-in-chiefs Slave Trade Report for 1888, that these are now given ' d'une maniere plus sobre ' are not being fulfilled. Inclosure No. 6. Surgeon'Major Jayalcar to Colonel Boss. Muscat, November ], 1890* jjj. u/qlu/l/y j.* uvgrfluct j j ±ouu 1 HAVE the honour to admowledse the receipt of your letter of the Uth October, 1890, with he accompanying Report from the Residency Agent, Liugah, of the 30th September, 1890, and the Report of the Ees.deney Agent, Shargah, of the 30th September, 1890. under your endorse ment of theUth October, 1890, on the subject of the importation of slaves into the Persian Gulf ports from the Batmah and Siir. 2 I have the honour to state, in reply, that on making inquiry here I find that, although a general belief . S prevalent to the effect that several cargoes of slaves have been imported this year from the East Coast of Africa into the Batinah, no reliable information can he obtained! particulaily as the names of the Nakhodas of the vessels in which they were taken up the Gulf are not given in the Reports of your Agents in Lingah and Shargah. I have, howeverf communi- cated the purport of the above-mentioned Reports to His Highness the Sultan, with a vie^to his making laqumes with his Walees m the Batinah, and also to his adopting such measures Is may be necessary to prevent such wholesale exportation of slaves from his dominions in future. 8. With regard to Suri vessels carrying slaves into the Golf under French colours they have been notorionsly known for the last three or four years to carry on this practice on a wholesale scale but His Highness the Sultan, at mv representation, now promises to take In early opportunity to demand an explanation from the chief men of Siir of the eircmnstances under which such vessels have come to change their national colours. nuance, unaer wiucn61 Inelosnre No. 7. Colonel MocJcler to Colonel Ross. Muscat, March 8, 1891. I HAVE the honour to request you will kindly give me instructions as to what course of action I should advise and press on the Sultan of Muscat to take with regard to boats belonging to, and manned by, His Highness's subjects of Sur or other places on the coast of Oman, carrying the French flag and provided with French papers. 2. I am informed that many or several such boats have, within the last two years, put into Mattrah and Muscat harbours, I have never myself during tbe years I have been in Muscat seen a ' buggalow ' or native boat carrying the French flag, and that young Africans, certainly raw slaves, have been seen on board such craft; and it seems to me that the only object such boats can have in carrying the French flag and papers must be to cover unlawful traffic, viz,, slaves—there are no French merchants here, or market for French goods. 3. In this connection I would quote from translation a letter from the Chief of Um-ul- Kawain, dated 18th Rabia 1st, 1308 (2nd November, 1890), forwarded to me under your docket dated the 9th December, 1890 : ' The people here think that if they wish to bring slaves they can do so under French colours, like the people of Siir and other places.' 4. These French flags and papers are, lam informed, given by French Consular authorities in Madagascar, but under what pretext 1 do not know. They cannot possibly, having no interest in bottoms manned by subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, or even in the cargo of such, which, if they had, would not, I think, establish such right, and that the cargo carried by such boats is French is not plausible, have the right to give flags and papers to them; but it is just possible that some sort of fictitious sale of such bottoms, or a share in them, may be regularly gone through at Madagascar, and such, if it is the case, may perhaps be held to complicate matters, 5. But it is evident that if the open running of slave cargoes by such craft is to be stopped, I must be prepared to advise the Sultan of Muscat, at any rate, what action he can and ought properly to adopt towards them, and not only when they may come into Muscat harbour, but as to a proper form of notification he should issue to the owners of them, his own subjeets at Siir and elsewhere, and also be able to advise the Commanders of Her Majesty's ships of war as to the measures they ought to take when such craft come or are brought within their cognizance and reach. 6. Dr. Jayakar tells me that he talked over this subject with a Commander of one of Her Majesty's vessels on duty here, who appeared to consider that he would be taking a grave responsibility on himself were he to interfere in any way with such craft. 7. By next mail I hope to be able to give you a further report on the subject and His Highness Seyyid Feysal's views regarding it, which he has promised, but have not been yet received, together with details of Siir boats carrying the French flag, of which there are said to be thirteen ; but as the question is a fairly clear one, aud to save time, I would now ask you for instructions of Government as it stands. 8. There is no French Consul at Muscat. Inclosure No. 8. Colonel Mochler to Colonel Ross. Muscat, Match 14, 1891. IN continuation of my letter dated the 8th March 1891, I have the honour to append a nominal roll of thirteen Nakhodas of Siir, boats carrying French colours and papers, furnished to me by His Highness Seyyid Feysal, who, however, stated at the time that there were probably more. 2. I have ascertained that His Highness Seyyid Feysal would not venture to interfere m any way with such boats, or his subjects in them, covered by the French flag and papers, even though such craft were clearly laden with slaves. 3. And since my last report was written, I have had the opportunity of discussing the subject with Captain Dyke, commanding Her Majesty's ship Sphinx,' who informs me that he would not venture to meddle with any boats carrying the French flag and papers, and that under what circumstances such papers had been got, or by what right they had been given would not be questions for him to inquire into or entertain. 4. It seems quite true, therefore, that, as the matter stands at present^ the people of Um-ul-Kawain have good reason to suppose, as stated in the quotation given in paragraph 3 of my despatch dated the 8th March, 1891, 'that if they wish to bring slaves, they can do so under French colours, like the people of Svir and other places,' without fear of interference. 5. And it appears to me that the subject is one to which the attention of the English Foreign Office should be drawn. 6. No one here seems to know the exact conditions under which, and from whom, the French papers under reference are obtained, and I have never seen such papers myself; should farther information come into my possession, I should esteem it my duty to make a further report.52 Inclosure No. 9.

On the second occasion he said he bad found this to be tbe case, and tbat, if a single instance of misconduct as to slaves or raids on the part of Suris could be brought to his notice, he would stop granting the flag and protection^t ^ as it appears to me to sW that the French Consul has now doubts, to eay tho Jeasty of the legality or propriety of his action.53 APPENDIX No. 8. Mt . Egerton to M. Bihot. M. le Ministre, Paris, July 23, 1891. I HAVE tbe honour to acquaint Your Excellency that Her Majesty's Indian Government have received information to the effect that French Consular officers and officials appear of late to have frequently given French papers and the French flag to native vessels belonging to Siir and pther places in Oman. Thus, according to the reports which • reached India, there were at one time thirteen SUr boats at Muscat carrying French colours and papers which were said to have been granted by the French authorities at Obokh. But it is more especially to officially attested cases at Aden that I have now the honour to draw Your Excellency's attention. In a letter of the 15th March last, the Political Resident at Aden transmitted a deposition made by the commander of one of several Siir vessels to whom French papers were given, which deposition was accompanied by copies of the French papers, and was to the effect that the French Acting Consul at Aden, M. Labouseiri, had granted to him and the masters of three other Arab craft the right of hoisting the French flag. On the 1st April the Resident reported another instance of an armed Siiri vessel obtaining French papers and a flag at Aden, Your Excellency will certainly learn with surprise that a French Consular officer at a British port should thus have been giving the French flag to vessels belonging to the territory of the Sultan of Muscat; and I cannot permit myself to doubt that your Excellency will cause instructions to be sent to Aden which will put a stop to the repetition of such proceedings on the part of the Consular Agent.

If the information now received by His Highness the Sultan is correct it is evident that an attempt is being made to naturalize as French subjects such subjects of His Highness as are desirous of carrying on the Slave Trade with impunity under the protection of a P/ench flag. 3, The Sultan informed me some time ago that the French flag of a Siiri buggalow was taken back by the French Consul at Aden, but, as His Highness did not seem sure of the information, it was not reported to you at the time; this news is, however, now confirmed by what the Wali of Siir writes in his letter of the 29th Shaaban, 1309 (March 29, 1892).56 Inclosure 4 in No. 4. Translated purport of a letter from Muhammad -Un-Ahmed'hin-Nasir, Wali of 8ur, to En Highness Seyyid Feysal, the Sultan of Muscat, dated the %Uh Shaaian, 1309 {March 27, 1892). (After compliments.) n i. FOUa vessels have arrived here from Al-Yaman-one belonging to Muhammad-bin-Abdullah- bin-Snltan, the second to Abdullah-bin-Saleh-bin-Juweid the thi^rd to the sons of Muhammad-bin- Hamad-bin-Shameh, and one belonging to Saeed-bin-Muhammad-bin-Bilal; and it is evident that thev touched at Obokh with the intention of obtaining protection over lives and property. The French Consul there has given them flags for the protection of their lives and property on the agreement between him and them that they should become (French) subjects, and on the condition that they should build houses in Obokh and live there, so that it may be known to Christians (Europeans) that they are (French) subjects, and that they have (landed) property in Obokb^ They therefore took houses and lived there in order to obtain protection over their lives anu. property. Since then the boat belonging to Musallam-bin-Hamad, son of Al-Katheeree, has proceeded to Obokh with the intention of obtaining protection. This is the state of affairs with the Janebeh, and I have written about it that you may become aware of it. The bug^alow of Muhammad-bin-Mubarak, in which is his son, has now arrived after obtaining the signature of the French Consul at Bombay on the original (French) certificate. Inclosure 5 in No. 4. Translated purport oflnd letter from Muhammad-hin-Ahmed-hin-Nasir, Wall of Stir, to His Highness Seyyid Feysal, the Sultan of Muscat, dated the ISth Shaaian, 1309 [March 29, 1892). (After compliments.) I HAVE to inform you that three buggalows have arrived from Al-Yaman, one belonging to Saeed-bin-Muhammad-bin-Bilal, the second to Muhammad-bin-Abdullah-bin Sultan, and the third to Abdullah-bih-Saleh-bin-Juweid. When they entered Aden, Bin-Juweid bad the last year's flag; the French (Consul) took it from him, and told them, '-'Ifyou desire to have flags, goto Obokh.' 'When they left Al-Yaman, they touched at Obokh and asked for flags of the Consul there, who told them that they could not have them, unless each one of them had a house of his own. There upon they agreed upon the price of each house to be 200 dollars, which they paid, and took from bim the flags. APPENDIX No. 10. Muhammad-hin-Muharalc-bin'Salim to Sultan of Muscat. (After compliments.) 26^ Shawal, 1310 {May 13, 1893). YOUR honoured letter has arrived and I, your servant, have understood its contents regarding the arrival of French ship (at Sur). I was then absent in connection with a dispute we had with the Beni Boo Hasan ; those who went to it (the ship) said she came for water. You have mentioned O Saiyid that we have sold a piece of land; we are unable to do so • the country is yours. I am your slave, and I have heard no mention of this. There is no foundation for this (report). Two years ago, when I heard that you were annoyed about the French flags, I ordered them (the Nakhodas) to cancel their certificates and them (to the French^ ; my brother, Rashid, accordingly returned his. We are under the protection of God and yourself, and our refuge is to Him and to you. This (I say) with God to witness.57 APPENDIX No. 11. Govemmeni of India to British Consul General, Bushire. Sir, Simla, August 11, 1891. I AM directed to aeknowledg-e the receipt of your two letters which refer to tbe grant of French flags and papers to native vessels belonging to Oman. 2. In the first letter you report that the French papers granted to- native vessels of Siir in Muscat territory were obtained from the French Consul at Aden, and not from Obokh. This report is confirmed by information received from Aden. 8. In the second letter yon report that His Highness the Sultan of Muscat lately sent to Colonel Mockler tbat draft of a letter which His Highness propased to despatch to the President tbe French Republic; and that he asked Colonel Moakler to translate the letter into English. Acting on the advice tendered to bim by Colonel Mockler, tbe Sultan has, before communicating with the French Government, solicited tbe advice of tbe Government of India as to what action he can safely take to uphold his jurisdiction in his own waters over such of his subjects as have got French flags, 4. I am dire3ted to say that the use of tbe French flag by subjects of the Sultan of Muscat can have no effect as against His Highness. He has full authority to punish any of his subjects who may infringe the laws of his country, whatever flag or papers they may have accepted, and he may safely take any steps he pleases to uphold his jurisdiction in his own waters over such of bis subjects as have French flags. ^ 6. The matter will be reported to Her Majesty's Secretary of State for tbe information of Her Majesty's Government, who have already been addressed. In the meantime it seems undesirable that the Sultan should send a protest direct to the French Government; but Colonel Mockler should not prohibit him from doing so. Our action in the matter should be confined to advice. APPENDIX No. 12. Colonel Stace to Brigadier' General Jo pp. Aden, March 17, 1892. I HAVE the honour to report as follows regarding five large buggalows which recently obtained French papers and flags at Obokh: — I obtained the papers of these for inspection ; of course, they were returned at once. 2. The buggalows were all heavily armed with cannon, muskets, swords, spears, and all sorts of weapons. The papers were given by the Governor of Obokh for the current calendar year. The ' Acte de Francisation' sets forth in each case that the owner, or Nakhoda, having for representative one Haj Dida, a protected French subject domiciled at Obokh (who is a Gadabursi Somali, and who can have no connection with Siiris), is such and such a person, and then proceeds to grant the French flag. 8. As a matter of fact, in each and every case the Nakhoda and crew were Siiris, and the buggalows had nothing whatever to do with Obokh or any other French possession ; they simply went to Obokh to get the flag. The character of the Siiris is too well known for me to eay more on tbat subject. In all these cases, I noticed that tbe crew was so large as to be quite out of proportion to the requirements of ordinary traders—from twenty-five to over thirty men. 4. I received private information that the vessels were intended for the Slave Trade ; but I am unable to produce evidence of this, as the informant (one of the crew of one of the vessels) was afraid to come near me.

WITH, reference to your despatch of the 7th April, 1893, I transmit to your Excellency herewith a Memorandum containing a substance of information, which has reached this Department though the India Office, showing the extent to which the Slave Trade is actively carried on in Oman and the Persian Gulf by Siiri dhows flying the French flag. In commanicating this Memorandum to the French Government, I have to request you to point out, with reference to M. Develle's note of the 5th April, 1898, that there would appear to be no less than twenty-three dhows, said to be registered at Obokb, Madagascar, and elsewhere, engaged in the traffic in slaves under cover of the French flag. Your Excellency should at the same time request that an investigation may be made, and that the registries imay be examined in comparison with the list furnished in order that it may be ascertained whicb of these dhows are really registered. Your Excellency should also ask that instructions may be sent which will insure that the proceedings of the owners and masters of the dhows which proved to be registered, but which are indicated as engaged in the traffic in slaves, should be carefully watched. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) KIMBEELEY. Inclosnre 1 in No, 1. i Memorandum, DURING a visit which Major Sadler, the Agent of the Indian Government at Muscat, recently paid to Siir, he was informed by the Indian traders there, who consist of seven firms, that all the slaves landed at Siir are brought in Siiri dhows flying the Franch flag ; the traffic taking place twice a-year, viz., during April and May, and again from the middle of August to the end of October. It is believed that the mischief is by no means confined to the abuse of the French flag by those to whom that flag has been granted by a duly constituted authority, but that it is freely used by Arabs who have no right to it. The slaves 'are said to be usually landed in parties of from five to ten; they are never kept long at Siir, but are sent up for sale to the Batineh coast and up the Persian Gulf in smaller boats in parties of two to five, the Nakhodas passing them off, if questions are asked, as belonging to their crew.0020! etje ijaie, m[ li ition 5§ i-u c *i^ 0re J ur ^ n ^ voint at Ras-al-Hadd, the Nakhodas of dhows, with slaves on hoaitf, hail the fashing-boats, and if the coaBt is clear they make for the Siir creek, otherwise they land the slares at convenient places on the coast snuth of Eas-al-Hadd, such as Ras Gomelah and Askhari whence they are marebed overland to Siir. As regards numbers, the Indian traders thought that from 200 to 300 slaves are now landed fi'ure ^ J Major Sadler was himself inclined to estimate the number at a higher Major Sadler saw no signs of the French flag duiiag his vi^ifc, as all the larger shipping was but tl^ Indians told him that the Jenebeh tribe openly avowed that their object in memo^w r C ^ an ^ P a P ers wa8 to rul1 slaves with impunity and escape search by British The Indian traders gave the number of dhows flying the French flag at twenty-five, which nearly corresponds with a list furnished to Major Sadler by the Sultan nf Muscat, and which is thTBeni bu^AH eleVen dhoWs are showa as belonging to Jenebeh, and twelve to iK, ® a ^^ e . r believes that all the slaves sold on the coasts of Oman, and the large maioritv dhows 080 Persian Gulf, are br0Ugllfc t0 Siir fr0m the EaSfc Coast of A ^ ica in Siir ' i Foreign Office, lelruary 9, 1895. V Inclosure 3 in No. 1. Major J. Hayes Sadler to Colonel F. A, Wilson. Sir. i Muscat, September 26, 1894. ONE of my objects m lately visiting Siir was to try and ascertain to what extent the traffic in slaves is still being carried on in that port. 2. The Indian traders, who number seven firms, do not, as in the towns on the Batineh coast, inhabit a separate quarter : their houses are scattered ' about the town ; they have therefore more' than usual opportuuities of mixing with the people and of knowing what is going on. They inform me that all slaves landed at Siir are brought in Suri dhows flying the French flag; the traffic takes place twice a year—during April and May and again from the middle of August to the end of October—in fact, before and after the height of the south-east monsoon. The slaves are usually landed in parties of five to ten. They are never kept long at Siir, bat are run up for sale to the Batineh coast and up the Persian Gulf in smaller crafts in parties of two to five, the Nakhodas passing them off, if questions are asked, as portion of their crew. Occasionally they are landed in larger batches. A fortnight before Her Majesty's ship ' Sphinx ' reached Siir, a party of fifty had been landed and despatched northwards as above indicated. But few seem to be sent inland to the Sharkiyyeh and Jaalan, as, owing to the system of irrigation in those parts, there is not the same demand for labour on the date plantations as there is in the Batineh, where the date trees have to be watered from wells. Before turning the point at Ilas-al'Hadd the Nakhodas of dhows with slaves on board hail the fishing^boats, and if the coast is clear they make for the Siir creek, otherwise they land the slaves at convenient places on the coast south of Ras-al-Hadd, such as Has Gomelah and Ashkari, whence they are marched overland to Siir. 8. Regarding the number of slaves annually brought to Siir, the Indian traders inform me that the traffic is not carried on to the same extent as it was some four or five years ago they estimated that between 200 and 300 are now landed yearly. A native's ideas on generalizing cannot always be depended on, and I should be inclined myself to put the number at a higher figure, in view of the fact that twenty-three dhows appear to be engaged in this trade, and of the seizures made last year by Her Majesty's ships off Zanzibar. _ The fact, too, that no cruising has been done ,off this coast for the last three years removes all check in this direction. If the Slave Trade carried on by Siiri dhows has declined within the last four or five years, which I think is questionable, it is owing to the operations of our men-of-war on the Zanzibar station, and to the arrangements made [to check the traffic by the British and German Adminis trations on the East Coast of Africa. As these arrangements become more perfected, it will doubtless be made year by year more difficult for slave runners to reach the coast from the interior of Africa ; in the meanwhile the traffic to Siir continues under the protection of the French flag. Information regarding the despatch of slaves from Siir towards the Batineh and the Gulf rarely reaches the Agency in Muscat; it is to every one's interest to prevent its doing so, and in cases where news has been received it has been too late to act on. It might be possible to obtain information from the Indian traders, but this would not reach in time, and their position might be a dangerous one were it to leak out that they were in the habit of supplying it. 4. I saw no signs of the French flag during my visit, for all the larger shipping was away ; the Indian traders told me they often heard the Jenebeh talking amongst themselves, and that they openly say their object in taking the French flag and papers is to run slaves with impunity and escape search by English men-of-war. The Indian traders gave the number of dhows flying the French flag at twenty-five, which corresponds pretty accurately with the totals shown in the last list I have lately received from the Sultan, a copy of which I inclose. r60 In this list eleven dhows are shown as belons^inj* to the Jenebeh and twelve to tne Beni-bu- Ali. Compared with the list furnished to you with this^ Office letter, there is a decrease of eight in the number of Jenebeh and an increase of three in the number of Beni-bu-Ali dhows flying French colours. The present list is not authoritative, lor it has been compiled merely on suck infarmation as the Sultan's Walijwas able to obtain in a roundabout way, direct inquiry not being possible. I think, though, it may be taken as fairly accurate. 5. Much of the information given above was already known to us, but it is interesting to find it confirmed by eye-witnesses on the spot; and in telling me what they did, the Indian traders seemed anxious to afford me all the information they could. 6. 1 believe that all the slaves who are sold on the coasts of Oman and the large majority of those taken into the Persian Gulf are brought to Siir from the East Coast of Africa in Siiri dhows, and Mr. Rennell Rodd wrote me demi-officially last year that, from inquiries made in Zinzibar, he had come to the same conclusion. If, then, this central depot at Siir could be broken up, a practical stop would be put to the importation of slaves into Oman, the littoral of the Persian Gulf. The one difficulty which at present seems to stand in the way of our taking effective action in this direction is the protection afforded to the Suri dhows by the French flag. I have already, in paragraph 4 of my letter dated the 14th June last, pointed out that thb Sultan is taking no steps to enforce his jurisdiction in his own waters over such of his subjects that fly the French flag; in point of fact, he seems to look upon it as a grievance that the British Government does not prevent the French from giving his subjects their papers and flag. 7. Were it not for the French flag it would sesm easy to intercept the communication between Siir and the East Coast of Africa by dispatching two of Her Majesty's ships to cruise during April, May, August, September, and October—one between Ras-al-Hadd in the direction of Gwadur, and the other to patrol the coast from Ras-aUHadd southwards. The experiment would be a costly one, but it would render the traffic so risky that it would eventually have to be abandoned. 1. 2. 3. 4. ,5. 6. — 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. Inclosure 3 in No. 1.

We now forward copy of a letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, from wh ch it will be seen that, according to a statement made by the Commander of the French war vessel 'Troude,' the practice of granting the French flag and papers to these dhows has been discontinued.

IN continuation of correspondence ending with your Confidential letter of the 5th November, 1894, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, opy of a report from the Politieal Agent, Muscat, dated the 26th March. 2. It is satisfactory to note the statement by the Commander of the French war vessel 'Tioude' - ' that the practice of granting the French flag and papers to Siiri dhows has ceased. This should prove an important check to the Slave Trade to these coasts. It will also have a salutary effect on the Oman coast if, as Major Sadler has grounds for believing to be the case, the aspirations of the Beni-bu-Ali tribe for foreign interference, support or protection, have been definitely discouraged. Inclosure No. 3. Major J. Hayes Sadler to Colonel F. A. Wilson. Muscat, March 26,1895, WITH reference to my letter dated the 26th September last, on the subject of the Siiri dhows and the French flag, I have the honour to report as follows;—• 2. Yesterday evening the Commander of the R F. 'Troude' informed me that he had that morning received his orders by telegram, and that he would leave the following morning for Obokh, visiting Siir on his way. His object in calling in at Siir was, he told me,'to inspect such dhows as he might find there flying French colours and verify their papers. The Commander further informed me that the practice of granting Siiri dhows the French flag and papers at Obokh had now been stopped. • Appendix No. 14.62 3. 1 would also solicit a reference to paragraph 5 of my letter d ^ ed T th ® ^ ^AU T expressed the opinion that there were indications that the Jenebeh and ±5e ^ Du /:- would be willing to consider themselves French subjects.

Both requests e, I understand, met by M. Ottavi, the French Viee-Consul, with a direct refusal and an intimation that he would not discuss such questions with him. n ,7 The Wazeer seemed to believe the information he gave me, and I have no reason to doubt its accuracy, although it came to him through a channel which I should not ordinarily consider trustworthy. APPENDIX No. 16. The Harl of Kimberley to Mr. Howard. gj r Foreign Office, June 28, 1895. WITH reference to my despatch of the 9th February last, respecting the state of the Slave Trade in the Persian Gulf, I transmit herewith copy of a letter from the Government of India* from which it will be seen that, according to a statement made by the Commander of the French war vessel &lt;l Troude,' the practice of granting the French flag and papers to Siiri dhows has been discontinued. . • • v tt v I have to request you to express to the French Government the satisfaction with which Her Majesty's Government have received the information, which they presume is correct, of a step that should have excellent results in checking Slave Trade in the Persian Gulf. I am, &amp;c.,. (Signed) KIMBERLEY. APPENDIX No. 17. Sir E, Monson to M. Hanotaux. M. le Ministre, Paris, December 31, 1896. IN accordance with instructions which I have received from the Marquess of Salisbury, and in compliance with section 10 of the identical Instructions of 1887 issued to the Commanding Officers of British and French cruisers, I have the honour to inclose, for your Excellency's information, copies of correspondence received by the Admiralty relating to the case of three dhows under the French flag, which were detained in the month of September 1896 by Commander Baker, of Her^ Majesty's ship ' Sphinx/' whilst cruising off the coast of Arabia, and two of which (the ' Salama ' and the ' Saad ') were subsequently sent by his orders to Muscat for adjudication by the French Consular Representative at that port. As your Excellency will perceive from a perusal of these papers, Commander Baker was not satisfied as to the right of the dhows in question to fly the French flag, and he accordingly proceeded to the verification of their supposed nationality, in conformity with section 4 of the identical Instructions of 1887. In the first two cases, after examination of the papers, he had reason to suspect the dhows of fraud, and under section 11 of the same Instructions, he sent them, as stated above, to Muscat, in order that their right to fly the French flag might be duly verified by the competent French authorities, while in the third case the papers were apparently in order, and the dhow was accordingly allowed to proceed on her way. • Appendix No, 15.63 The Lieutenant who boarded the dhow offered to give the master a written statement of the circumstances attending the verification, as prescribed in section 7 of the identical Instructions, but was refused the opportunity of doing so. Her Majesty's Government are of opinion that in all these three cases Commander Baker acted in strict accordance with the identical Instructions of 1887, and with those given to the officers of Her Majesty's ships employed in the suppression of the Slave Trade, copies of which are doubtless in the possession o£ the French Government—an opinion which I venture to express the hope your Excellency will share after perusing the inclosed correspondence. In transmitting to your Excellency the enclosed copies of Commander Baker's Reports, Lord Salisbury desires me to call your bixcellency's attention to the fact that all the three dhow were crowded with slaves, and that in the' third case, although this was obviously the fact. Commander Baker, out of respect for the international nature of the 1887 Instructions, allowed the dhow to go free ; and I am to add that, whilst admitting the strict correctness of Commander Baker's conduct in this respect. Her Majesty's Government feel sure the Government of the Republic will agree with them in wishing that persons guilty of so gross an abuse of the French ^ flag, as were the owner and master of the dhow in question, should have been brought to justice, and that the slaves who were sheltered by the French flag should have been rescued from their fate. In connection with this subject, and with reference to the report mentioned in the note which the Marquess of DufEerin had the honour to address to your Excellency on the 4!th July, 1896, to the effect that the practice of granting to Siiri dhows the French flag and French papers had been abandoned, I am desired by Lord Salisbury to inquire, in conclusion, whether this salutary instruction is still in force. I have, etc., (Signed) EDMUND MONSON. APPENDIX No. 18. The Marquess of Salisbury, to Sir E Mans on. Foreign Office, March 16, 1897. Sir, THE French Ambassador called to-day and referred to the communication addressed to * M. Hanotaux on the 31st December last with regard to certain dhows sailing under the French flag, which were arrested by the Commander of Her Majesty's ship Sphinx and handed over to the French Vice-Consul at Muskat for adjudication as having slaves on board. His Excellency said that the matter would be the subject of an investigation, but with regard to the inquiry made whether the instructions for discontinuing the grant o£ the French flag and papers ti) Siiri dhows were still in force, he was instructed to state that there had been a misapprehension on the point, and that there had never been any intention of discontinuing the practice. Your Excellency will remember that the original statement on this point was reported by Her Majesty's Political Agent at Muskat to have been made to him by the Commander of the French man-of-war Troude. The letter from the India Office reporting the statement was inclosed in the Earl of Kimberley's despatch of the 28th June, 1895, to the^Marquess of Dufferin, and a communication was made to the French Government expressing satisfaction at this decision. The French Ambassador said that no reply had been made at the time to this communication, hut that the Minister of Marine, on. being made aware of it, had stated that there must be a mis understanding, as the Commander of the Troude denied that he had said anything of the kind. It will be noticed, on reference to Captain Sadler's Report, thafe the statement in any case went no further than the discontinuance of the practice of issuing these papers at Obokh, though it was interpreted as indicating an intention of altogether abandoning the practice.

Muskat, May 3, 1897, Sir, I H 4VE the honour to report, with reference to the extract from my diary r of this day's date^ which I attach for easy reference, that Sayid Saeed, the Sultan's Wazir, came to see me to-day, to inform me, on behalf of his master, that news had been received to the effect that all Siiri, boats which have this year gone to Zanzibar have takea French papers, presumably at that port, and64 that, so far as the information received went, such papers were granted merely npon payment of a fee of 5 dollars. A reference to the authorities at Zanzibar will probably show whether this information is correct or not. His Highness, in affording me the above information, was desirous of obtaining advice as to the course he should take, as he naturally views with apprehension the fact that so many of his subjects at Siir should claim the protection of the French flag. In reply, I have advised His Highness of the instructions and advice contained in paragraph 4 Of Government of India letter, dated the 11th August, 1891.* Upon my doing so, however, a question was raised as to the status given to subjects of Oman who have taken out papers of naturalization in India, and who, on returning to Oman, have received support from the Consulate here; for I was informed that the claim would be put forward that persons under French protection would on this ground be considered as without the Sultan's jurisdiction, and that action, as suggested in the letter from the Government of India I have quoted, would, therefore, be impossible. ^ A case was cited to me in support of this contention, viz., that of Ali-bin-Juma, regarding whom there has been some correspondence. I quote this case, as the question has already been before the Government of India j but this is only one case in many of a like nature. It appears, therefore, that, though the Sultan is desirous of following the advice given him ia 1891, he fears that the fact of the british Viovernment having allowed his subjects, when naturalized and returning to Oman, to be assisted as British proteges, will cause any action he may desire to take in regard to the transfer by his sulejects of their vessels to the French flag to be nullified. His Highness has, I am given to understand, the intention of making a formal protest to the French Consular authority here. I have suggested to His Highness, however, that, in view of his contentions, it will be advisable if he will defer doing so until I have received orders from the Govern ment of India as to the status of Omaui subjects holding papers of naturalization from a British authority. I have the the honour to request, therefore, that early instructions may be given to me on the question now raised. Extract from Diary of the Political Agent, Musical. May 3, 1897. IT is reported that all Siiri dhows which have this year visited Zanzibar and the African coast have obtained French papers, and that the only formality necessary is a payment of 5 dollars. This requires confirmation. APPENDIX No. 20* ^Commander Boskym, to Bear'Admiral Bawson. 'Blonde,' at Zanzibar, May 4, 1897. (Extract.)

You are aware that this is against the rule observed in all countries, and that it is against custom, for every one returns to his original jurisdiction. Livmg (in a place), even for a long period, does not remove one from (the jurisdic tion ot) his hrst place, nor does the possession of immovable property. This affair has become extensive and general, so that injury and loss have resulted (from it). We therefore complain to me liovernment and to you about this occurrence, and we expect that everything will return to 1 ts origina! nationahty, and that the Government will bestow favour on us by preventing all the othcers trom following in their countries a course contrary to the rule. We hope that the affree- ment existing between us will always continue to increase, and we shall thank the Government and yourself for justice and kindness. May you always be above what you desire. No. 2. Purport of Letter, dated the 15M July, 1897 (14a Safar, 1315),/rm M. Ottavi, to His Highness the Sultan, Muskat. (After compliments.) WE have been honoured by the arrival of your letter, dated the 25th Dhil Hiiiah (1315^ which you sent to us at a time when (we were) not in Muskat, and about which we gave a reply to you orally on the day of my visit to you on my return from Siir. What you say in it is, that some of the people of Sur and the Batineh have obtained protection and flags against the custom observed id all countries, by living and acquiring a little immovable property in our Colonies, and that you expect that our officers may be ordered not to grant protection and flags to the Arabs of-these parts because it injures your Highness' interests. I have already explained „to your Highness at my interview, and I regret since it is not possible to comply with your desire Perchance your Highness has been misinformed (misled), since you have been told that (right to) protection cannot be acquired by living in a country ever so long nor by the acquisition of immovable properly, nor by any other means. The truth is that such out of the strangers as i 0 ? # an - j ^ r0111 a eouatr J r 011 their complying with certain known conditions, which are of different kinds m every country. r &amp; u w . Many of the people of dhows out of the Arabs of Oman and others have been in the habit of visiting our Colonies since the last forty years, and have elected to live there, and have obtained from the officers there protection and flags m a right manner in accordance with the rules of those Colonies and the orders issued by the Minister of Marine Affairs, and no one has a rbyht to dispute it (to rise in the matter). 5 Your Highness has acknowledged (confirmed) this mode both publicly and privately since the time of your assuming the Sovereign powers, more especially since these last three years, that is to say, since the time that I have been living in this town, for during these last three years the owners of our dhows have been under the jurisdiction of this Consulate, the road of truth and law, Moreover, we decided, according to the French law, the case of the two dhows accused of importing slaves, and the final decision is in Bourbon. Secondly, according to your official request made to us, we prohbited the people of our dhows from entering Dhofar when yon ordered it to be blockaded. Thirdly, by the orders of my Government, I went to Siir for two consecutive years for the purpose of watching the French dhows. Under these circumstances, this affair is an established one m the state in which it is, and in its right of being a lawful one. - What would be opposed to custom would be to order our officers to change the rules for protection and the granting of flags specially for those who came originally from Sur and the Akn n wW are ru i es aPP 1 ^ to all (general), and they cannot but be general ones. Also what would be opposed (to customs) would be to prohibit persons under our protection from visiting any particular port on account of their origin, and also to prohibit them from possessing many dhows. According to what we saw this year, our old protected subjects have taken flags for then- new dhows and the case is not, as we think, that they have increased (in numberl. And also, what would be against custom, is that there should be obstacles in their journeys (voyages) and their mercantile transactions. 1° the „ i f iur7 , Wl ' ie J h if 11 were ( real ' ho' &gt;» ' 'tat others than yourself have not eomvlained o£ it, and how is it that you younelt did not mention it durino- a il ibis long period until now ? 0 ^ ^ 0pe £0r t he fri f ndshi P o£ our Government to you, it will, God willing, remain permanent, and many salaams to you. 8188 FD ' —66 No. 3.

No. 5. Purport of Letter from tie Sultan of MusJcat, to M. Ottavi, Consul of France, dated the Mth Jemadt I * {25iA October, 1897). (After compliments.) WE have to inform you that we have received your letter, dated the lltb October, Jcontainmg a reply to a letter sent by us on the subject of the Samamee, who is an inhabitant of our town of Siir, and wbo and whose forefathers were born in it. In the letter which we sent you before it, bearing date the 25th Dhil Hijjah, 1314 ( a.h .), we have shown all the necessary rules current amonlthe States in mutual friendly relations. We hope yon will send it to the great French Government, which in our estimation is too great to interfere with the local subjects (bodies), and which we hold to be aloof from it, owing to previous agreement (concord) between it and our forefathers. There is no doubt that every one mast return to his original nationality, as is plainly stated in that letter, and no regard is due to silence for some years or to the purchase ot some immovable property or to a want of an immediate demand. Every one that goes out ot a limit, when he returns to that limit returns to the jurisdiction under which he was before. The Indian Government removed Ali-bin-Juma from their protection on our claiming him after his having been for more than thirty years under it. When they were satisfied as to his birth-place and his original nationality, they cause 1 him to return to his original nationality. With regard to our notification about the war at Dhofar, we did not intend by it the Suris or such as are included in this doubtful class only, but referred to adhering to the rule for fear of a stranger meeting with an injury by his going to a party against whom there is a war, according to what is contained in your letter dated 15th July. As to your exercising your jurisdiction oyer the two dhows accused of importing slaves, it was like the jurisdiction^ exercised by the Indian Government over Ali-bin-Juma before our demand, for the apparent jurisdiction (had the eiiect) of screening them behind the flags before your inquiry and our inquiry took place. F'* a ll th is past period jurisdiction was exercised over Ali-bin-Juma in the sama manner as over all the other persons under the protection, and they (the two cases) are alike. We expect from the Sta^te (Government) a course of conduct towards us such as would be like that current among all. ** e hope you will do full justice as we expect it of you. You must do kindness to us, and we hope for a reply from you, and salaams. • JS, J?.—-This man is a French-protected subject.67 No. 6.

APPENDIX No. 26. The Marques of Salisbury to Sir E. Monson. Sir, Foreign Office, June 26, 1900. IN my despatch of to-day I transmitted to your Excellency copies of three telegrams from the Viceroy of India on the subject of the visit of the Sultan of Muskat to Siir in Her Majesty's ship 'Sphinx,' and the discussions which appear to have taken place between His Highness and the Siiri tribe on that occasion for the return of French papers and flags. On the 25th instant the French Ambassador called at the Foreign^ Office and communicated verbally the substance of the report which had been received by the French Government from their Consul at Muskat with regard to these proceedings. His Excellency said that the French Government understood that the Sultan went to Siir on board a British man-of-war; that he demanded from the Siiri tribe the surrender of their French papers, denouncing France as his enemy, and saying that she wished to obtain half of Oman ; that the tribe refused j that the Sultan remained several days at Siir, and eventually, by means of threats, and supported by the presence of the British ship, he succeeded in obtaining the surrender of three papers and a promise from the other tribesmen that they would send theirs back to the authority from which they had received them. M. Cambon said that the question was one between the French Government and the Sultan, and that he considered it right to state that, according to his view, the course which they ought to take, and which he believed they would take, was to insist that the three papers of protection which the Sultan had sent to the French Consul, M. Ottavi, but which M. Ottavi had refused to receive, should be returned by His Highness to the owners ; that he should equally return to the Siiri tribe their written engagement to give back the rest of their papers, and that if he were found to have made use of improper expressions towards the French Government or Agent, he should make a fitting apology. His Excellency called again to-day and spoke to me on the subject. He said that he did not suggest that the British Consul advised the demand of the Sultan for the surrender of the French papers by the tribe, but that the French Government would be forced to demand that they should be returned. He feared that the British Consul would advise the Sultan against doing so, and he thought that, on the contrary, the advice of Captain Cox should be that His Highness should accede to the demand of the French Government. In the absence of fuller details I declined to express any opinion upon this point. But I pressed on His Excellency the invalidity of the French claim to offer protection to the subjects of another Power which practically prevented us from stopping vessels when they were engaged in the Slave Trade. JVE. Camhon informed me that in future no papers of protection would be given, and that the existing papers should be carefully examined so as to exclude those for the grant of which no just cause existed. I promised to make inquiries into the matter, and assured His Excellency of the desire of Her Majesty's Government to regulate all such controversies in a spirit of equity and with a full regard for the rights of France and the reasonable susceptibilities of French public opinion. I suggested to M. Carabon that the reports of M. Ottavi on this and previous occasions appeared to be written in a partisan spirit which was calculated to excite irritation, and I suggested that he should, if possible, be transferred to another post, I am, etc. (Signed) SALISBURY.72 Mes declarations ainsi que celle du Commandant Kiesel se referent simplement au strict maintien du statu quo, que Sa Hautesse a paru vouloir modifier dans une de ses precedentes communications, en ce qui concerne les boutriers portant le pavilion Franca's.

Muscat, Fehfuary 12, 1902. acknowledging the receipt of your communication of yesterday's date, I am constrained to observe that if, as I think I am right in believing) you seek to interpret the expression ' statu quo ' mentioned in your letter in terms which involve or suggest a right on the part of the Government of the Kepublic to exercise, within the territory or territorial waters of the Sultan of Muscat, any measure whatever of jurisdiction over born and domiciled subjects of His Highness, such an interpretation cannot but be regarded as a purely ex parte one, with regard to which the Sultan has not been consulted, which he has never accepted, and against any suggestion of which, as he has informed His Majesty's Government, he has repeatedly protested. Such an interpretation would, in fact, be fundamentally inconsistent with the independence of the Sultan, and opposed to the terms of the Declaration of 1862 and to the first principles of the law of nations.

I have, &amp;e., (Signed) P. Z. COX. Consul Cox io M. Laronce. Muscat, March 5, 1902. AS I understand you are about to leave Muscat for Siir in the R. F. flag-ship ' Catinat,' I take the opportunity of asking you, before your departure, whether you are in a position to favour me with any communication as to the result of the reference to the Government of the French Bepublic contemplated in your letter to my address, dated the 14th February last ii reply to my protests. i I have the more reason for making tl)is inquiry in that His Highness the Sultan informs me that you and Commodore Kiesel intimated to him and his brother yesterday that you were authorized, when visiting Sur, to remind the Omani owners of dhows flying trench flags that a the Sultan of Muscat's jurisdiction over them in his own national territory is absolute; ' or words to that effect. As you are aware. Treaty engagements make it incumbent on His Majesty's Government to take a lively interest in this important question, and, in view of the correspondence which has already passed between us, I should wish to inform them of the foregoing, subject to any communication which you may feel able to favour me with in reply to this reference.76 Inclosure. Memorandum. THE communication made by the French Ambassador on the Uth August last with jegaxd to the use of the French flag by dhows belonging to Muscat and attention of His Majesty's Government, and the statements made by bjs Excellency have refeired to the British authorities concerned. . „ , n TTQWTY10T , + • inmiiriTiP' 1. While giving fall credit to the officers employed by the French Government in into the proceedings of these vessels for an impartial desire to ascertam the £a ^ ' H L./ j Government are uuable to resist the conviction derived from information which has reached them from various sources that a considerable amount of slave-trading has been camed on bj some of the dhows, and that the protection afforded by the French flag has been abnsed for this ^Two of the dhows arrested by His Majesty's ship ' Sphinx ' in 1S96 were found to contain . 200 negroes, of whom the greater part must have been slaves. t j i In June 1900 it was reported to His Majesty's Government that nearly 1,000 slaves had been imported into Siir that season. Of these 560 were believed to have been brought in by dhows flym Hi M^esty'fConsul at Mu cat reports that since 1st April, 1900, te has manumitted at the British Consulate 79 slaves—of these 49 were unable to distinguish between one flag and another, and the depositions of 12 others are not recorded in the Consulate; but of the remairung , no less than 14 deposed that thev had been brought from Africa in dhows flying the French flag. A statement made by a British Indian subject resident at Siir on the subject of the slave season of 19 1 is annexed to this Memorandum, and seems t &gt; show clearly that the french flag is used to a considerable extent in this traffic. . It seems probable that the inquiries made by the French ship of war Internet on this subject may have failed to elicit the fac^s in consequence of the precautions adopted by the dhow owners to ascertain before arrival at Siir whether a vessel of war is present there, and m that case to land their cargoes and remove all suspicious features before coming into port. 2. The part taken by the British Consul in the controversy between the Sultan and the French Consul on the question of the use of the French flag by His Highness' subjects has been greatly misunderstood by the French (Government. They are, in the first place, entirely mistaken in supposing that the Sultan's Prime Minister receives a pension from the Government of India. The late Vizier of the Sultan, Sayid Saeed-bin-Mubunmed, did not receive from the British or British Indian Government anything either in the way of pension or presents. Nor has the British Consul ever made use of the subsidy given by the Government of India to the Sultan for the purpose of exercising influence in regard to the question of the flag. It has, on the contrary, been the Sultan who has appealed to the British Consul for advice and support in regard to' this question; and the influence of the Consul has been not unfrequently exercised to dissuade the Sultan from any rash action, though he has not concealed his opinion that His Highness right of territorial jurisdiction over his own subjects cannot properly be impaired by the grant to them of the privilege of flying a foreign flag over their vessels at sea. 3. The circumstances of the Consul's visit to Siir in 1900 and 1901 have also been greatly misapprehended. There are from twenty-Hve to tuirty Hindu British subjects residing at Siir, for whose welfare the British Consul at Muscat is responsible. He invariably pays them a visit at least once in the year, and his usual time for doing so i* just before the monsoon, as all the chief men are then present. Some time before th^ visit in June 1900, the Sultan had asked that on the next occasion of a visit he might be allowed to travel also by the ship of war conveying the Consul. So far as the Consul had any opportunity of observing there was no question of the use of threats by the Sultan to the tribes. The Chiefs of all denominations came to His Majesty's ship ' Sphinx' to call upon him directly he arrived, and took him off to shore, where they placed a house at his disposal. Two days later Abdulla-bin-Salim, the Am'r of the Beni Abu Ali (one of the two tribes in Sur), came in, with nearly 1,000 men, to do the Sultan honour, and it was owing to his good offices that the Siiri flag-holders of both tribes executed the Agreement which they gave to the Sultan. In the following year the Sultan did not accompany the British Consul on his visit to Siir. The British Consul started for that place on the way to Kalat and Rufsheh, accompanied by a geological expert, to examine coal deposits. The ^ultan came down five weeks later at the urgent request of the Consul, in consequence of the difficulties in which the latter found himself involved by the hostile and suspicious attitude of some of the tribes. It is a mistake to attribute to Captain Cox, the British Consul, any desire to press the Sultan to assume an attitude antagonistic to the French Government or Consul in regard to this or other questions. 4. On the other hand, it seems to His Majesty's Government not unnatural nor irregular that the British Consul should communicate directly with his French colleague in regard to matters on which the Sultan has appealed to him for advice or support. There can be no doubt that, under the Anglo-French Declaration of the lOth March, 1862, Great Britain and France are equally pledged to maintain the independence of the Sultan and the integrity of his dominions, and that either Government has the right of remonstrating against any action on the part of the other which may appear to be at variance with that engagement. Considering the excellent personal relations which seem happily to exist between Captain Cox and his French colleague, it77 would savour &lt;&gt;£ pedantry to deny to them the right o£ direct communication on p ants affecting these principles before taking ihe more formal step ot' referring the (juestion for discussion between the two government*, and though _ it may perhaps be argued that Captain Cox gave to his communication too official a form, His Majesty's Government cannot perceive that he was at fault m addressing himself directly to M. Laronce on the subject of the complaints which he had received from the Sultan. 5, These matters are, however, only of subsidiary importance, and while His Majesty's Government have thought it r'ght to offer the foregoing observations and explanations in reply to M. Cambon's communication, they are happy to perceive that, on the main points of the question, the two Governments are practically in accord. [a] They understand that both Governments agree in desiring to maintain the independence of the Sultan, and to aid him in consolidating his authority. (i) That the French Government is determined to take all necessary precautions for preventing slave-trading under the cover of the French flag. [c) That no fresh papers of protection have been granted to Siiri or Muscat dhows since June 1900, and that the practice will be discontinued for the future. ^ {d) That a careful examination is being made as to the validity of present claims to protection based on the possession of Krench papers given prior to June 1900. (e) Thnt no right _ of protection on shore or in the territorial waters of Muscat is claimed by the French Government in respect of subjects of the Sultan of Muscat holding such papers, and that within the Sultan's territory they are to be regarded as subject to his ordinary jurisdiction. These bases appear to His Majesty's Government to afford a satisfactory settlement of the question. They would suggest that, for the convenience of all parties, it would be desirable that a list of the dhows and owners considered to be entitled to the use of the French flag should be communicated to the Sultan, and supplied also to the British Consul for the information of the British cruisers stationed in those waters. Annex. 1. Statement of British Subject at Stir regarding Slave Season, 1901. , Hindu, aged 50, British Indian subject, states: I have resided in Siir, on and off, for the last 30 years, paying an occasional visit to my home in India. I see anything that passes in regard to slave-dealing at Siir. I do not notice any marked decrease in the number of slaves that come to Siir. According to my estimation, not less than 1,000 came during the past season. Most of them have been taken away, but there are still about 50 left. Some Arabs from the Bussorah side are now here. I have seen two of them, they are stopping in the house of a man who acts as middleman for the purchase of slaves. The broker's name is Khamis Wad Hajjam of the Jeimebeh tribe, but I am not sure what section of that tribe he belongs to. These Up Gulf Arabs have, I believe, bought 7 slaves, and will go on purchasing 1 to the extent of the money that they have brought with them, and then clear off in small country craft. During the past season 6 dhows brought large cargoes of slaves?, among them were the dhows of— (1) Muhammad.bin-Khalfan, (-2) Abdulla-bin- Habbab, (3) Muhammad-bin-Saiyid, (4) Khamis bin,? I cannot remember at this moment the names of the others. The first three came Under the French flag. The dhows that bring them receive 10 dollars for each slave's passage to Sur. The men whose dhows bring the slaves are not necessarily the slave dealers. The chief shippers are— Saleh-bin-Muhammad Wad, Sheikh, Jennebeh, Arab flag. Rub any eh and Ibrahim, Bakhalil. „ „ Yusuf, Bakhalil, „ „ Abdalla Wazir Plathan or Makrani, .also imports slaves. He takes gunpowder and brings back slaves The slaves come both under the French and Arab flags. All the chief Sheikhs of Sur, whatever their flag, participate indirectly, if not directly, in the Traffic. Each man gives money to tho^e that are going to the African coast for the purchase of two or three slaves. Muhammad Mubarak, Salim-bin-Thabet, and all of them do this. This season good strong youths fetched . 180 to 175 dollars each. Ditto girls ditto , 150 to 300 „ „ Only '5 or 30 females were bought, A great many of the slaves are shipped by twos and threes up to the Batineh coast at the beginning of the date season. Muhammad Mubarak's dhow makes one or two vovages during the season. Khamis-bin Ali's two dhows go two or three times generally to Bombay. ' Khamis-bin-Musallim's two go two or three times, and on the way back come home via Aden and Mukullah, returning before the monsoon. &lt;Koi| «P9u5G^ | Beni Abu Ali.78 According to what I hear people say in conycrsaticn, many slaves come from a dlrtrict called tfJK Ar.ift.vw«asfa««B dollars between them on each slave landed at Sur.

(Extract.) , jlW,/««jy 21,1902. IN continuation o£ my letter of the 2nd instant, I have the honour to report that 1 was under the necessity of proceeding to Siir on the loth instant in connection with a serious robbery which recently took place on the premises of one of the British subjects there, and I then took the opportunity of verifying the information furnished in Inelosure Mo. 2 of the above-mentioned despatch, under the following circumstances :— # . . x1 .. , 2. T had oecasion to interview the chief Banians in connection with the robbery and their affairs' gen^rallyr'and when''the man visited me I said I had mislaid the notes he had given me before, and asked him to repeat the purport of what he had then told me. He proceeded to do so, and his statement was generally in conformity with that made to me two months before. With regard, however, to the names of individuals alleged by him as having brought slaves to Siir under the French flag, when pressed to be very carefol to give the exact names of the persons in question, he replied that he almost invariably heard them called by their fathers names according to the common habit of the Arabs, i.e., the son of so and so, e.g., Ibn Rashid, Ibn Saood, and that, while he was quite familiar with their personal identity and patronymics, it was difficult for him to swear positively to their first names, especially where there are two or three brothers of one family. . . . After examining 1 mingled the names he had given me with the names ot about seventy other Siiris, and went through them all in the presence of the Banian community and of the Sultan's Wali at Siir, inquiring, as 1 called each name, as to whether the owner of it was still alive and known to those present, and asking details regarding age, tribe, &amp;c- 3. The following is the net result of my inquiries-'the man——being responsible for the details connected with slave-trading, and the community generally for the correctness of the names as now gtated in corroboration or modification of those given by —— in November:— (o) The name as first stated was Muhammad-bin-Khalfan. This should read Ali-bin-Khalfan-bin-Rashid of the Beni Abu Ali tribe. Khalfan had two sons, Muhammad and Ali, both of whom habitually engaged in the Slave Traffic. It was Ali who brought the dhow home this year. He started with 110, but lost 20 en route. He sails under the French flag, and has now left with his dhow for Zanzibar waters. (6) The name as first stated was Abdalla-bin-Habbab. This should read Yusuf-bin-Khamis-el-Habbab ; ' Habbab' is the family nickname. Abdalla and Yusuf, sons of Kamis-el-Habbab, have been French flag-holders for ten or twelve years, and had a dhow which they sailed under French colours, but it was wrecked two years ago, and Abdalla has since died. Yusuf last season went as a passanger in the dhow of Suweilim-bin-Salim, an Arab subject, and has started again for Zanzibar waters. (c) The name as first stated was Muhammad-hin-baiyid. This should read Muhammad-bin-Saiyid-el-Jafferi. His house is at the Beni Abu Ali fishing village of Lashkareh, below Ras-el-Had, but he always docks his dhow at Siir. He flies the French flag over his vessel. He and his brother Ali brought about forty slaves this year, and have now left again for Zanzibar waters. 4. I have given the foregoing details of my procedure in order to make it clear that to the extent that is possible under the circumstances, I have verified the information previously given me. In my own opinion my Banian informant could have had no ostensible reason for making a wilfully false statement, and, if it was false, it is extremely improbable that he could have repeated it without any very material discrepancy after an interval of nearly two months. I think, therefore, that it may be accepted as reliable testimony of the fact that the three persons named did engage in the Slave Trade and under the French flag.79 APPENDIX No. 30. The Marquess of Lansdowne to Sir E. Monson, (Nc. 171.) Sir, Foreign Office, April 23, 1902. THE French Arabafsador spoke to me to-day upon the subject of the Memorandum which I had handed to him on tbe 16th instant in regard to the cireumsfcanees under which certain dhows belong ing to Siir and Muscat were in the habit of flying the French flag. _ His Excellency told* me that he wished me to understand that his conversations with ma on this subject were purely unofficial, and that he regarded the question as being one of very small impor tance. He reminded me that, although I had thought well to maksj a copy of his Memorandum of t&amp;e 14th August, he had received no instructions to commuuicate such a document to rae; he proposed, in the same way, to take a copy of my Memorandum and to return the original to me. He wished me particularly to understand that there was no question of the French Government desiring to inter fere in any way with the Sultan of Muscat, and that Irs only wish had besn to discourage us, so far as he was able, from any action which might, by obligiusj the owners of these dhows to give up the flags they already possessed, affect the amour propre of his country. I told His Excellency that I had quite understood his desire thit our conversations should be regarded as personal exchanges of views rather than as formal representations on the part of our two Governments, and that I was &lt;r!ad to learn from him that he regarded the incident as of s'ight importance and as virtually disposed of. I am, &amp;c., (Signed) LANSDOWNE. APPENDIX No. 31. 4, Commander Kemp to Hear*Admiral Sir C. Drnry. (Confidential). Sir, ' Sphinx ' at Muscat, April 17, 1903. WITH regard to the French flag incidents at Siir and Muscat, I have the honour to report as follows:— In the neighbourhood of Siir there is an Arab tribe called the Beni-al-Ali, who form part of the Gafiri Arabs, and who are at present at war with the Hajarien section of the Hinawi tribe. 2. The people living in Siir belong to the Gafiris, the Sheikh of whom is named Abdulla-bin- Salem. Abdulla-bin-Salem found recently that the people at Siir, that is the people of his own tribe, were assisting the Hinawi, with whom he was at war, by sending them stores and assisting them with transport, etc. He then took a force and came down to East Stir, and posted men on the roads leading from Siir inland. He also forbade any native vessel to enter or leave Siir Creek until the matter was settled. After some negoriations between himself and the headmen of Sur, it was arranged that the latter should pay him 300 dollars. According to Arab custom this fine would have been collected by the headmen of Siir from among the inhabitants as beet they could. 3. Among other dhows lying in Sur Creek was one owned by a certain Mubarek-bin-Hamed, who had taken out papers in the name of bis son, under which he flew the French flag on his dhow- Both these men were undoubtedly subjects of the Saltan of Muscat, who does n' t admit that they have any right under the French flag in his own territory. 4. While the negotiations between Abdulla-bin-Salem and the headmen of Siir were going -on, Mubarak-bin-Hamed expressed his intention of leaving Siir in his dhow under cover of the French flag, obviously in order to avoid his tribal difficult.es and responsibilities He was warned that if he did so he would be prevented, and, on his persisting, some of Abdulla bin Salem's men fired, and a shot went through the French flag. 5. A few days afterwards the son, Mubarpk-bin-Hcmed, managed to get away to Muscat, and complained to the French Consul, who demanded from the Sultan that a fine of 1,51)0 dollars should be paid for the brief detention of the dhow, and that the people who had fired on the French flag might be punished. The Sultan refused to allow the claim, and informed the British Consul. Major Cox protested strongly against the action of the French Consul in formulating such a claim, which was incompatible with the independence of the Sultan. Sheikh Abdulla-bin-Salem is loyal to his suzerain, the Sultan of Muscat, and his action was purely a matter of inter-trbal politics. 6. The second cage occurred on the 9th April. On 8th April, three Arabs and their two servants, all natives of Siir and subjects of the Sultan of Muscat, arrived at Muscat in a mail-steamer from Bombay, the Arabs travelling 2ud class and their servants 3rd class. [1413] N80 The two servants were sent to the quarantine station, and the three Arabs were told to report themselves every day to the Health Officer for inspection, the rule being that the 3rd class passengers are kept on the quarantine station and 2nd class passengers report themselves every day ' During the night o£ the 9th April, the three Arabs obtained a hired native boat, and having picked up their two servants at the quarantine station, sailed for Siir. ihey were £o lowe a y by a steam-boat fram the 'Perseus' ia accordance with the Sultan's request conveyed through Major Cox, and brought back to Muscat; the native boat went on to Siir. n i 7. On arrival at Muscat, at about 10 p.m ., the five men were delivered over to the British Lonsul who kept them in the Consulate for the night, and handed them over to the Sultan next morning who sent them back to quarantine. . . , , • i, , j a When the time for qui ran tine was finished, the Sultan imprisoned them m the foit, and expressed his intention of keeping them in prison for three months for a gross breach of the Quarantine Kegulations. , , ^ . 8. The French Consul who claimed three out of the five Arabs as French proteges, protested to Major Cox against his having detained them, and demanded their immediate release from the Sulta^. Major Cox declined to admit the right of the French Consul to discuss the question, and the Sultan refused to release them. • i j n The Sultan, in a letter to the French Consul, pointed out that these men were punished tor a breach of the law of their country, and that the whole question of the French flag m Oman was under discussion between the French and British Governments in Europe, and that he was prepared to accept their joint decision with regard to the matt er, with due regard to his own indepen dence, but deprecated heated correspondence in Muscat himself. 9. Major Cox considers that this claim on the part of the French Consul is an undoubted attempt to interfere with the Sultan's prerogative, and has telegranhed strongly to the Indian Government, asking that instructions may be sent, and that assurances may be given to the Sultan that his authority will be upheld in the matter. 10. It is generally the custom of the French Consul to visit Siir at tbis time of the year, and stay there a month. Previously to these things happening the French Consul had expressed his intention of going down to Siir in a Native boat, but he has now abandoned bis intention, and probably means waiting for a man-of-war, M. Dorville is the French Consul, and has only been in Muscat a month. 11. These incidents have caused Major Cox to postpone his intended visit to Darfur, at the request of the Sultan, who is apprehensive of things happening. 12. The Health Officer at Muscat is the British Consular Surgeon, who receives pay from the Sultan for doing his work, and who is entirely answerable to him for the Quarantine Regulations being carried out.

I HAVE the honour to report that the question of the French flag in Oman has just been acutely raised. The circumstances are as follows : — 2. It is necessary, in the first place, to go briefly into tribal politics in order that the Govern ment of India may be acquainted with the exact position. The tribes ot Oman are divided into two great racial divisions—Ghafiri and Hinawi. Tribes of both divisions are settled indiscriminately in the vicinity of one another throughout the country, but their interests and organization a^e distinct, and some sections of the one division are almost invariably at war with sections of the other. Siir is inhabited by Gbafiris, primarily of the tribe of Feni Abu Ali, subject to whom are another Ghafiri tribe, the Jenebeh. Most of the French flag-holders are 'recruited from tbe»^ Jenebeh sub-tribe, but some also from the main tribe of Beni Abu Ali. Sheik Abdul a-bin-Salim of the Beni Abu Ali, is the Head Sheikh of all the Bed Abu AH, calls himself the Ghafiri ' Amir'; and apart from the more remote sovereignty of the Ruler of Oman, which Sheikh Abdulia loyally acknowledges, the latter holds absolute practical way over all the GhaSri tribes of that part of Oman which is known as the district of Jalam ' (sse map. Inclosure No. 9). Sheikh Abdulla, who is a very old man, and his Bedouin followers (as opposed to the sea going population of Siir), ever since the time when they were defeated by a British force in March 1821, have always been good friends to the British. Sheikh Abdulla is well known to me, has repeatedly invited me to come and stay with him at his home, about 70 miles inland of Siir, and two years ago, when Dr. von Kraft and I were held up by the Hinawi while endeavouring to get to the coal-bearing country offered to muster the entire following and forcibly introduce ub into the coal-bearing tract from the south side.[1413] N 2 It was Sheikh Abdulla also who, in June 1900, came iato Siir with 1,000 armed followers to greet the Sultan, and afterwards so materially assisted His Highness in obtaining from the French flag- holders the written undertaking which they afterwards broke. 3. For some weeks past active hostilities hive been s^oing on between the Ghafiris under Abdulla- bin-Salim and the Hinawi tribes of the district, especially a tribe called the Hijrieen. Now, the poorer part of the populace o£ Sur partly m:ike their livelihood by transporting rice and other provisions to the villages of the hinterlani, not only Ghaliri, but also Hmawi, when th'ire is no war, and also at other times, so long as the risk is not too great; but Abdulla-l&gt;in-Salim, not being able to terminate current hostilities and bloodshed by other means, and becoming incensed at his fellow tribesmen of Siir continuing to supply his enemies with provisions, came down to Siir about the 16th March with a force of 500 armed men, camped in the Eigeh quarter of Siir {vide sketch map accompanyin2!•) and proceeded to hold all the roads leading to the interior, until such time as he could obtain satisfactory assurances from the Elders of the port that they would cease to allow their transport to take provisions to his enemies. Sheikh Abdulla at the same time wrote to the Saltan, asking him to come down and help him arrange the affair, but at the moment no ship was available for the journey, and ten days ja ter, when the Resident kindly understook to drop His Highness there in the ' Lawrence, ' if he ^could find his own way back, be thought it would be too late to be of use and that in the meanwhile the matter would have adjusted itself. In fact, that was the news which he received from Siir. Subsequently the Sheikh wrote to me, also complaining that the Banian community were assisting his enemies by sending provisions to their villages, and asking me to put a stop to it. His letter and my reply form Inclosures Nos. 7 and 8. The details of what passed between Sheikh Abdulla and the Elders of Siir will be found in the news-letter sent to me by a confidential agent at Siir (Inclosure No 1) from which it appears that the dhow owned by one Mubarek-bin-Hamed which carries French papers made out in the name of his son and not himse 1 ^, was lying in the creek behind Siir, and was ready to go to sea. The owner, fearing that he might be forced to subscribe to the money pavmeut demanded by Abdulla-bia-Salim, and that if he refused, his dhow mi^hfc be detained, ordered the French flag to be run np and endeavoured to run the gauntlet past Sheikh Abdulla's camp out of the creek. The position will be quite clear from a reference to the map. After due warning, the dhow was fired at. It seems unnecessary to go into the ethics of Sheikh Abdulla's proceedings, which were clearly the result of ordinary inter-tribal complica tions peculiar to the conditions of life in Oman. The main^ point is that the man Mubarek-bin-Hamed made use of the French flag in the territorial limits of Siir in order to evade his tribal obligations. His son, Khamis-bin-Mubavek, hurr ed to Muscat as soon as he could get away, and laid his complaint before M. Dorville, the new French Consul, who relieved M. Laronce three weeks ago. According to the statement of an informant who is generally reliable, M, Dorville was at first disinclined to take the matter up but the flag-holder said that he would return his papers if he was not supported, where upon M. Dorville sent for Goguyer, and after consultins; him addressed to the Sultan the letter, copy of which forms Incl^sure No. 4. His Hiyrhness the Sulfas forward®i his letter to me and also a copy o£ his own reply thereto also attached. My own protest, M. Dorville's reply, and my final rejoinder (Nos. 6, 7, and 8) explain themselves. 4. Just as I am concluding this letter His Highness sends me a further letter which he has received from the French Consul, demanding compensation in the sum of 1,500 dollars for the detention of the dhow, and saying that he is referring the question of the damaged flag to his Government. The second incident I am reporting in a separate letter for facility of record. Agent at Stir to Major Cox. (Translation.) March 27, 1903. (After compliments.) (The arrival of Abdulla-bin-Salim from the interior was reported by the writer in a previous correspondence.) , , March 21.—Four of Abdulla-bin-Salim's men were passing down the Sikaikera road,' when they met some women slaves going to fetch water. The women, seeing the men, started shouting, whereupon a number of Siiris rushed out with their rifles to Sikaikera and fired off some shots. On hearing this, some hundred men belonging to Abdulla-bin-Salim sallied out to meet the Siiris, but four of the Suri E'ders thereupon came upon the scene and settled the matter- After this the Siiris kept a ijuard, night and day, in Sikaikera, as they feared that Abdulla-bin- Salim would prevent the Siiris from going there for water. March 22.—About thirteen Siiris went to visit Abdulla-bin-Salim, among them being Sheikhs Muhammad-bin-Mubarak and Nasir-bin-Muhammad Gelani. When they iipproaehed the eacamp- ment, Abdulla-bin-Salim sent word by his slave to say that only Sheikhs Muhammad-bin-Mubarak and Nasir-bin-Muhammad should come in, and that he had no concern with the rest. The Sheikhs above mentioned visited Abdulla bin-Salim, whom they interviewed, Abdulla-bin-Salim told them to stop supplying all provisions to the Hijrieen, and also forbade them to ship or bring anything for them in their buglas, or to warehouse their goods. Finally, it was settled, after a deal of discussion, that, as the present season was over, nothing could be done now, but that, for the coming season, the Siiris would respect the wishes of Abdulla-bin-Salim. March 23,—Nothing transpired, March 24.--Sheikh Muhammad-bin-Mubarak sent 100 dollars to Abdulla-bin-Salim for the expenses of his followers and transport animals., which Abdulla-bin-Salim accepted.il/«rc/5 25.—Abdulla-bin-Salim sent word to Muliammad-bin-Mubarak that he could not accept the 100 dollars, bat that he wanted 200, failing which relations would be broken off, toe Khcr (Siir Creek) would be closed, and no boat would be allowed to enter or leave it. The Siiris replied that the four local tribal sections would consider the matter and send a definite leply the next day. The 100 dollats sent to Abdulla-bin-Salim were only subscribed by two men, the general public knowing nothing about it: but when the dollars were returned, everybody came to know what had transpired. Of the 100 dollars, 50 were paid by Muhammad-bin-Mubarak and 50 by Nasir-bin-Muhammad. At night representatives of the four sections met and discussed the question. All save Muhammad- bin-Mubarak and Nasir-bin-Muhammad said they would not pay ^bdalla-bin-Salim a pice, but this was all bravado, as they were, from all accounts, frightened of Abdulla-bin-Salim, and only made a pretence of refusal. The only ones really against payment were Abdulla-bin-Khamis Mussalim and Salim-bin-Mussalim of the Mukanneh section, French flag-holders. Ali-bin-Saiyid of the same tribe, however, declared his willingness to pay for the whoie section, and paid 50 dollars, the reason being that he has a new bugla, and was frightened lest, in the event of things going wrong, his bugla would be destroyed. Of the remaining 50 dollars, the Ghelani tribe paid half and the Arama the rest. The 200 dollars were thus collected. ^ March —There was a bujjla belonging to a man owning French papers in the Khor. It was about to start for Bombay, and belongs to Mubarak-bin-Hamed, Uaz-ki. The papers are made out, however, in the name of Khamis-bin-Mubarak, his son. The owner of the bu2:la, not being aware that the 200 dollars demanded by Abdulla-bin-Salim bid been subscribed, ordered his khallasies to hoist the French flag over his bugla. Tne khallasies were running up the flag when one of Abdulla- bin-Salim's men shouted out to him from a neighbouring hill not to hoist it; he replied that he had his masters orders, and ran it up. Then Al dnlla-bin-Salim's man fired two shots at the flag, one of which took effect and rent the flag. It remained up, however, all the day. The owner of the bugla said he would go to Muscat and report the matter to the French Consul. Muhammad-bin-Mubarak advised him not to do so, as there was nothing to be gained by going to Muscat, and promised to consider the matter the next day. The 200 dollars were sent to Abdulla-bin-Salim, but no answer was received from him as to whether he accepted the amount or not. Muhammad-bin Mubarak^ bugla came in to-day, but could not enter the Khor, as Abdulla-bin- Salim's permission had not been obtained. At night word came from AbdulIa-bin-Salim to the effect that he did not accept the 200 dollars, and that only Muhammad-bin-Mubarak^s bugla could come in, but no other. 27. - The Wali of Siir, Hamood-bin-Hamed, came in from Bilad, and advised the Siiris to give Abdulla-bin-Salim 300 dollars and three bags of rice. The Siiris agreed, and word was sent to Abdulla-bin-Salim, but nothing has been beard from him. Abdulla-bin-Salim has sent for Sheikhs Muhammad-bin-Mubarak and Nasir-bin-Muhammad. No further news. The owner of the bugla which was fired at has now left for Muscat to lay his case before the French Consul. M. Dorville to the Sultan of Muscat. (Translation.) (After the usual compliments.)

I LEARN that, in the course of disturbances at Siir among the tribesmen of Siir and Jalan, the followers of a certain subject of the Sultan of Maskat, namely, Abdulla-bin-Salim, Sheikh of' the ^Beni Abu Ali tribe of Jalan and Siir, interfered with a bugla in the Siir Creek belonging to another subject of His Highness Saiyid Feyeal named Mubarak-bin-Hamed, Razaiki, resident and domiciled at Siir, and that the said bugla hoisted the French flag. I also learn from His Highness that you have called upon him for satisfaction in this matter on the grounds that the said Mubarak- bin-Hamed is under French protection, and that he considers such a claim is incompatible with his independence. 2. I have the honour to observe that the disturbances at Sur, during which the incident in question occurred, have been in progress for some little time past, and to my certain knowledge appertain purely to the inter-tribal feuds of Oman; and I therefore feel it incumbent upon me to protest most strongly against your action, which constitutes interference in the internal affairs of the Sultan's territory of a nature which is altogether'inconsistent with His Highness' independence, and, pursuaatly with the mutual Declaration of our Governments, dated the 10th March 1863. Moreover, in the absence of special instructions from my Government, I cannot admit the title of the said Mubarak-bin-Hamed, or of any other subject of the Sultan ofjMaskat, to l rights under the French flag while in Oman territory or territorial waters, until favoured with an intimation from yourself giving a list of the persons and setting forth the title of each individual to fly the said fla^ for the information and consideration of His Majesty's Government, which, under the Deelaratioa aforesaid, is clearly entitled to be consalted in the matter. 3. It must, I think, be plain to you that, to avoid any misuuderstanding between us, it is very necessary that the British Consul should be furnished by you with such an explanatory list • but I have not hitherto been favoured with one by your predecessors, and His Highness, likewise not having received one, is unable to furnish me with a copy. ° Meanwhile, I am sure you will agree that a state of things which makes it possible for anv subject of the Sultan, during the progress of internal inter-tribal disturbances in Oman, in which he or his tribes are concerned, to hoist a foreign flag and claim protection under it against his Omani fellow subjects (and therefore against the Ruler of the country), constitutes a position which is a direct encroachment upon the integrity of the Maskat Sultanate—which my Govern ment is bound to see preserved—and is, at the same time, incompatible with the terms of the Declaration of 1863 above referred to. I have accordingly the hopour to inquire whether you cannot see your way at the present juncture to favour me with a complete list of His Highness the Saltan's subjects, over whom as in the case of Mubarak bin Hamed, you claim to extend your protection within the territory and territorial waters of the Sultan's dominions in order that I may be able, after ascertaininjr the Sultan's views in each case, to submit the matter to my Government. M. Dorville to Major Cox.

I note that you feel unable at present to favour me with any list of the nature requested, not having received any instructions to that effect. Perhaps, however, I may look forward to receiving the nformation at a later date, after you have made a reference to your Government,84 3. In the absence of such information, I can only repeat that I specially impugn the title of the said Mubarak-bin-Hamed, or anv other subject of His Highness the Sultan similarly situated, to any rights of protection under the French flag while in^the territory or territorial waters of Oman, and that I must take objection to any action of yours implying a claim on your part to accord such protection. Major Cox to Government of India. (Confidential.) Masqat, April 11, 1908. I HAVE the honour to report the details of the second incident mentioned in my telegram of the 10th instant to your address. 2. On Wednesday, the 8th instant, there arrived by the mail steamer from Bombay five Arabs of Siir. Three had paid second-class fares in order to escape being sent to the quarantine station, and two came as deck passengers. The three second-class passengers were allowed on shore, subject to daily medical inspection by the Sultan's Health Officer; the other two were sent with the rest of the deck passengers to tha^ quarantine station in the bay some three miles from Maskat. The three second-class passengers duly came for medical inspection on the morning of the 9th, and got no permission to leave Maskat; on the contrary, they are stated to have asked permission, and, as a matter of course, to have been refused it. In the evening, however, after con ferring with Khamis-bin-Mubarak, Razaiki, the man who had come to complain of molestation by Abdulla-bin-Salim {vide my letter of to-day^s date), these three second-class passengers, whom it now transpires all claim French protection, left in a hired native craft for Siir. In the morning the guard on duty at the Sultan's quarantine station reported that two deck passengers had disappeared during the night, and, on further inquiry, it was found the three second-class men had also decamped from Maskat by sea during the night. His Highness thereupon sent his quarantine Superintendent over to the Consulate to inform the Health Officer (the Agency Surgeon) and myself, and to ask me what course I recommended. As the . night had been windless, it was improbable that the dhow in which the parties were believed to have absconded could have made much progress. Accordingly, at the Sultan's desire, I addressed Captain Pears, commanding His Majesty's ship ' Perseus/' and requested him to send his steam-cutter after it, and this he was good ^pough to do. 3. The steam-cutter was accompanied, on behalf of the Sultan, by the official in charge of the local quarantine station, and the parties were in due course overtaken about 30 miles from Maskat. On the approach of the steam-cutter, they are understood to have run ashore and endeavoured to escape over the rocks, but were apprehended and brought back to Maskat. They were handed over at this Consulate about 9-45 p. m . and the Sultan was informed; but, owing to' the lateness of the hour, he requested that they might remain here, and they were accordingly kept in the guard room of the Consulate till morning. Soon after day-break this morning (the 11th April), His Highness wrote to me officially, asking me to express his thanks to the Commander of the Perseus' for his effective action, and begging me to keep the men a little longer until he had been able to make arrangements for their safe reception. This I acquiesced in, and at a later hour duly handed them over to an official and guard sent by the Sultan to receive them. They were taken direct to the quarantine station to complete their term, on the expiry of which. His Highness intends to prosecute them. Before they left, and the Agency Surgeon being indisposed, after obtaining the Sultan's acquiescence, I took the statements of ail five men. Three of them claimed to be French subjects out and out. M. Dorville has addressed me protesting at my having imprisoned three French proteges, and I have replied that five Siiri subjects of the Sultan broke quarantine, and had been appre hended, and that I am unable to admit his right to address me on a matter which concerns only the Sultan and his Health Officer. Time does not admit of my sending copies of the correspondence, as the mail is just leaving. Statements of Persons who hroJce out of Quarantine on the night of April 9,1903.

We left here in a ' badan ' at dusk—the vessel belonged to a map at Taiwi, and we went as passengers. There was very little wind, so we went to sleep, and went into Bunder Jisseh to wait for a breeze. The two deck passengers, Saeed and Musalim, who came with us from Bombay, came on board at Jisseh, but I was asleep and know nothing as to how they found their way there. ' I am a French subject, having flown the French flag for five or six years. I got it at Jibuti, where I own a house. There is no one belonging to me residing in it.

I am under the belief that under those articles I and Juma and all the members of our families come under French protection, wherever we may be in Oman or Bombay or Jibuti, or anywhere else. The bugla hands also come under French jurisdiction, at least the permanent employes do, not temporary ones, perhaps. u I cannot exactly explain what grounds I have for believing that we are all French proteges. My cousin, Juma, knows most about it, and he says so. I made a mistake in stating that I share the ownership of the house at Jibuti: it belongs really to my cousin, Juma, entirely, but we are a united family and look upon it as a family concern. Juma and I were both born and bred in Siir; neither of us, nor any of our family, have ever lived in Jibuti. As to the house, I have never lived iu it, and cannot say that I have seen it myself.

I reached Bombay about a month ago from Aden, and returned to Oman by last mail, with my father, Abdulla-bin-Khamis, and three others from Sur. I came second class, and was allowed on shore under orders to appear for medical inspection. We hired a ' badan' belonging to Taiwi to take us to Sur, and did not get any permission from the doctor to go. We left evening before last, about sundown. Khamis-bin-Mubarak, Ruzeiki (whom we found here on our arrival), my father, and Khalfan Wd. Bilal formed the party. After leaving here we put into Jisseh Harbour and lay up there. I went to sleep.

If Saeed-kn- Mubarak said he was a servant or employe of mine he lied, for I have no servant with me. We three second-class passengers left Muscat in a hired ' badan ' belonging to the port of Taiwi, this side of Siir, about dusk, the night before last. Khamis-bin-Mubarak, Razeiki, also joined us, and there were also two askaris in the vessel on their way to Siir. &lt;c When we got outside the harbour, there was so little breeze that we put into Bunder Jisseh Harbour [ about 7 miles away—P. Z. Cox ] to wait for the wind. While we were there, in the early morning we were joined by the two deck passengers before mentioned—Saeed and Musallifl*; they had seen the light of our ' badan' (class of vessel) and swam off to us. First one came and then the other. We started out from Bunder Jisseh before daybreak, and when we were near Eas Abu Daud [about 27 miles a way-—P. Z. Cox], the man-of-war's steam-boat bore down upon us. We did not make for the shore in order to evade her; we had just landed when she came up, and were going to cook our food. None of us attempted to escape, and, as soon as AH Salman called to us to come to him, we came. We five Siiris were taken on to the steam-boat; Khamis- bin-Mubarak and the two askaris were allowed to proceed. ' I am not a subject of the Sultan at all. I consider myself an out-and-out subject of the French Government, and possess two sets of papers given me by that Government, one being a set of articles for my three dhows, and the other a paper setting forth my status as a French subject. It has been signed by the Commanders of all the men-of-war (French) that have visited Siir. It was originally given me by M. Ottavi about eight years ago.

Statement of the Quarantine Superintendent of His Highness the Sultan, regarding Flight of jive Siiris from Quarantine on the night of April 9, 1903. ALI SALMAN, Arab subject, states :— ' I am in charge of the Sultan's quarantine arrangements, under the direction of His Highness' Health Officer. 'I have now acted in this capacity for three years past—first under Captain Smith, then under Captain Grant, and now under Captain Lethbridge. ' The Detention Roles are, briefly, these ;— ' Deck passengers are sent to the quarantine station direct from the mail-steamer and remain there a week, i.e., until the morning, or eve, of the arrival of the following mail-steamer. ' Second-class passengers j (native), who really only pay second-class fare to escape going to quarantine station (but who otherwise mix with the deck passengers throughout the journey), are allowed on shore, but have to report themselves daily at the hospital for medical inspection for a week. Occasionally, wnen second-class passengers are bound for distant Oman ports by dhow, and the journey takes several days, they have been allowed, after three or four days in Muscat, subject to medical ins pection, to spend the remainder of their time at sea. 'By last mail there arrived five Siiris. They were all of one party and fed together, but two had deck passages and there second-class passages. Abdulla-bin-Khamis was the chief man of the party. He came to me on board, and in the presence of several other passengers said : ' If you can accept anything, and not send these two men of our party to quarantine, I am ready to give it to you,' ' I said: f No; I was not for anything of that sort.'-T-r VX8) 00221 ,uu JUlilnj CajKg !!1 *' tBIj ggi :boRl( Kislie lasil ( 87 'Next morning, at 8 o'clock, all three came to hospital together for inspection. I was there. 'After inspection Abduila said to me : 'We want to go away to-day/ '1 replied : 'No; how can you possibly go—you have only just arrived. Wait a few days and then see if the Saheb will let you go a day or two before the time.' ' They replied : ' Very well; we will do as you say.' ' I did not know of their departure without leave till next morning, when the quarantine sepoy came over from the quarantine station and reported that two Siiris had absconded during the night. I at once went to the bazar and made inquiries, and found that the three second-class passengers had gone, too (in a Taiwi ' badan'), and it was plain to me that they had all gone together. ' It is quite evident that the whole thing was planned previously, because the two men who went to quarantine took nothing with them but what they stood up in. They left all their kit with Abdulla, obviously so that they might have no impediments when breaking oat of quarantine. 'I reported the matter to His Highness, and he told me to report to the doctor and say that this sort of thing could not be allowed, and desired him to consult with Major Cox as to what ought to be done. As the doctor was sick with fever when I went to his quarters, I was taken on to Major Cox, ' In the result the 'Perseus' steam-cutter was sent after the truants, and His Highness sent me in her to represent him and to identify the persons. We overhauled one ' badan' en route, but found it was not the one. W hen nearing Ras Khairan, we spied a * badan' coming our way from the direction of Sur, so we got alongside and a^ked if they had met the Taiwi 'badan.' They said, ' Yes, but they have gone right along close to the shore/ ' They gave us the direction and we followed it. In the course of time I made out the sails of the ' badan ' in the distance. As we approached, the occupants hauled down their sails and I saw them disembarkinir with my field glasses. This looked suspicious. The Lieutenant in charge thought this might be a fishing-boat, but I said, ' No; these must be the men we want/ The place where we came up with them was overhung by the steep sides of a cliff and they could get nowhere. One pre tended to be goinj; off to make water, one was doing something else, etc., but they could not get away. Two or three khalassis of the * badan' ware left by them in the boat. When I called them they said—' What's up; what do you want ? ' I called out the name of each and said we had come for them, and they came without further trouble, seeing that we were armed.

Sir, I HAD a further conversation with the French Ambassador to-day in regard to the recent seizure of dhows flying the French flag at Muscat. His Excellency called my attention to two letters addressed to M. Dorville, the French Vice-Consul at Muscat, by Major Cox, dated respectively the 8th and 10th April. His Excellency showed me a French translation of the former and a copy of the latter document. v He told me that in the view of the French Government Major Cox had no right to address official remonstrances of this kind to the French Consul, and that he was certainly not in a position to write such a sentence as that in which [vide letter of the 10th April) he says: ' I can only repeat that I specifically impugn the title of the said Mubarak-bin-Hamid, or any other subject of His Highness the Sultan similarly situated, to any rights of protection under the French flag while in the territory or in the territorial waters of Oman, and that I must take objection to any action of yours implying a claim on your part to accord such protection. Major Cox wrote as if he was himself the Government of Muscat, and was intitled to lecture the French Representative for his conduct. If such remonstrances were to be made, it was the Sultan who should make them, and not Major Cox. I replied that as both Great Britain and France had agreed t&gt;) uphold the independence of the Sultan, it seemed to ,me natural and desirable that, in cases where the Sultan's rights were apparently infringed, our representative should freely discuss the situation with his French colleague. His Excellency said that he did npt disagree with me, but that such discussion should be of an unofficial character, and not couched in the extremely official style which Major Cox affected. His Excellency begged that I would picture to myself the feelings of His Majesty's Government if the converse case were to arise, and the French Consul were to address Major Cox in not less peremptory language for some alleged interlerence with the rights of the Sultan. I told His Excellency that Major Cox's tone might perhaps have been two severely official, but that in substance I held that he was right in objecting to M. Dorville's demands. I said that, after our coriver^ation on the 27th ultimo, I had referred to the Treaty, in whic%' 1 found no authority for His Excellencv's contention that owners of dhows flying the French flag could not be arrestfd by the Sultan for violations of the municipal law of Muscat, without the concurrence of the French Consul. Under Article IV of the Treaty, it was provided that 'subjects of the Sultan of Muscat actually in the service of the French shall enjoy tlie same privileges which are granted to the French themselves.' It could scarcely be contended that these French flag-holders were persons actually in the service of the French within the meaning of the Treaty. His Excellency admitted the correctness of my quotation from the Treaty, but said that the provision which I had cited, and which dealt specially with persons in the service of the French, did not in any way affect the rights enjoyed by other persons who were entitled to fly the French flag, and consequently to claim French protection. I said that this seemed to me a doubtful contention, and I reminded His Excellency that the French Consul at Muscat on the 5th March 1902, stated in writing to Major Cox that the French autlorities bad no intention of subjecting Muscat subjects to French jurisdiction, and that they only claimed the right of surveillance and police over dhows carrying the French flag. I pointed out to His Excellency that the persons who had been recently imprisoned by the Sultan for breach of the local Quarantine Regulations bad committed their offence and been arrested within the territorial waters of Muscat. 1 had certainly been under the impression that the French Government were in agreement with us in holding that no right of protection on shore or in the territorial waters of Muscat could 1 e claimed by the French Government for subjects of the Sultan holding licences to fly the French flag, and that such persons within the Sultan's territory were admitted to be subjects of his ordinary jurisdiction. I gave His Excellency a note of the statement which I had made to him, and he promised that he would consider it. He added that the French Government were anxious that any rights arising from the possession of the French flag should not lead to abuse. It was, however, impossible for them to take back the flags from the persons who had already been given them. On the other hand, the French Government had been quite read} to fall in with our suggestion to the effect that a list of such persons should be prepared, and such a list in fact had been made out, and would have been handed to the Sultan when the recent incident arose. It would, His Excellency said, be easy for the Sultan to communicate the list to our Consul, so as^to avoid misunderstandings. I am, etc. (Signed) LANSDOWNE.2 A rt. II.
