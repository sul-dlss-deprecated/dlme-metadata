Most of the glass is gone and only the spaces gouged to contain them completes the scene. The top and sides of the front surface are decorated. A long horizontal strip at the bottom bears no traces of ever having been decorated in this fashion. In the center of the main panel, seated on a rectangular object, is the young Harpocrates or perhaps Re-Horakhty. He is flanked by kneeling kings who hold out offerings; behind the kings are uraei with sun-disks perched atop what may be Was scepters but which could also be plants, traces of red glass in the bodies and behind one of the snakes. Blue glass remains on the childs\u2019 cap and in parts of the background. Gilded gesso is found on garments and on cobras. \r\nCondition: Inlays missing; chips in wood; mended together from three pieces.", "medium": "Wood, gesso, glass, gold leaf, lapis lazuli, pigment", "dimensions": "1 1/2 x 3 9/16 x 3/16 in.
