' ' ■ ' V 7 Aa Chairman of The East Indian Wool Trade Committee I have been sent a copy of the enclosed letter addressed to The Director of Haw 1 aterials, War Office, by the London Appraisement Committee for Persian Gulf wools which opens up a most important matter in connection with the recommendations made in The East Indian ool Trade Committee's Report of July last, particulai reconmendation made in para 22 which is as follows :- I*® father recommend that, inasmuch as Liverpool and London, the lormer witn its ample warehouse accommodation specially built dor tms trade some years aup by the ! ersey Docks and Harbour oard have oeen proved to be the best centres for the distribution of our o™ requirements and for the supply of other countries, parti oul rly rFeince suiu the United States of toerica, tlie (-ovemnient of India 'taice such steps as may be necessary to ensure that for a oeriod of noo less than live years after the termination of hostilities ail fool {and ir) shipped from India and the Persian'Gulf be sent to the United Kingdom for sale. H i rior to the successful occupation of esopotamia neither the ritish nor the Indian Governments had any effective control over the trade oi the country and a certain trade was done in wool direct to arseilles in addition to the larger and more regular business to London and Liverpool, During the /ar the Government ofIndia has regulated the Indian wool trade so that* exports are con- lined to the United Kingdom, but some authority in Bagdad now appears ^ to nave allowed 1 ersian wool to go direct to arseilles in tonnage provided by the ritish shipping Controller, with consequences which cm only lead to the grave disadvantage of Titish interests, as stated in the enclosed letter, for it is cle r that if considers find they can obtain in arseilles a price two to three times as high as they can get in London or Liverpool the trade with this country must come to an end, at any rate so long as the price pq»tl is controlled* I venture, therefore, to suggest that the matter is one which demands immediate consideration in connection with the .teport of the last Indian iool Trade Committee which fully provides for the needs of France, and that if it is impossible to decide at once upon a policy to be finally adopted the chipping Controller at any rate snoulu be notified that he ought not to place ritish shipping GkoS at the disposal of iue trade which is likely to operate so much against other ritish interests. I would further suggest, firstly, that the remedy pro posed by the Assessment Con* ittee can only be temporary and doe^, , g to the root of the trouble; and secondly, that the existence of a pre-war trade between the Persian Gulf and I arseilles should not prejudice the ultimate decision which should look to ritish interests first as a conseuuence of the ritish occupation of eso- potamia. In case this letter involves a reference to two Depart-COPY. / LOfDON, 14th Nov, 1918, The Director of Raw Materials, ' othill Street, Westminster, S.W. We, the undersigned, Wool Brokers engaged in the distribution of I ersian Gulf Wools, and also the buyers’ representatives who have ^een engaged for some time past in appraising these Wools on the fixed schedule prir^s, beg to call your notice to the fact that contrary to the arrangement by which all these Wools were to be sent to the United Kingdom, permission has been given at Bagdad for some thousands of bales of these wools to be shipped direct to Marseilles where they have been placed on the open civilian market. So far, as regards all the wools received in the IJ.K. and which have been appraised at reasonable prices, it has been customary to accede to the demands of the French Military Authorities at these apprai prices, being the same as those paid by the English manufacturers working under Government control. In as much as the wools shipped to arseilles have been placed on the open market, that portion solo, to the civilian trade has realised about two to three times as much as the appraised prices here. It will be a serious blow to our iUiglisii iiarkeos il some mutual arrangement cannot be effected to control the prices on the same basis both at I arseilles and London. ,/G suggest that those Jools shipped to Marseilles not yet disposed of, should be appraised on the schedule prices of the ..mglisn Authorities, as it is not reasonable that France should participate in the allocation of Wools in the U.K. at fixed prices whilst the vastem markets are upset by allowing the French civilian trade to operate direct. We are strongly of opinion that the original arrangementsT ‘ r '•'^7' ’.'' MHMMMiw - 2 - ^4 should be rigidly adhered to, and that representations should be made to the French G-ovemment with a view to avoiding this un necessary competition.

The Classes of wool grown can be divided into three groups, viz. : Merino wool for clothing, crossbred for clothing, and low wool used mainly for carpets, rugs, &amp;c. The approximate proportion of these classes is 1,074,000,000 lb. merino, 1,022,000,000 lb. crossbred, and 700,000,000 lb. low wool. Merino.

Low Wools for Carpets, &amp;c. The British Empire produces :— 9 per cent, of carpet wools. 40 ,, produced by Russia. 51 ,, ,, other countries.Introductory 2. Owing to the comparative insignificance of the Imperial Contribution to the Carpet Wools of the world, this product of British India, which we shall hereafter refer to as East India Wool, has not in our opinion received the attention it deserves at the hands of the Departmental Committee on the fiextile I radcs, though we in no wa^ depreciate the importance of the consideration given to the Carpet Industry on pp. 72/5 of the Report. Apart from this reference, however, there is nothing to show that East India Wool is of r eal importance to the National well-being in Peace or to the Empire in Wai, nor does it appear, except perhaps by inference, to be included in the recommendations accc - panyincr the Report which refer solely to Merino and Crossbred Wools and their produces. It is primarily to remedy these omissions that this Report is prepared. Production figures 3. We must first correct the above figures which not only require re-grouping, as in need correction “other countries, Neutral for instance are included 180,000,000 lbs. the product of Turkey, an enemy State, but much under-estimate the product of British India, which we understand is intended to include the Native States. The figure, 60,000,000 lbs., really approximates the quantity exported from British India, but as has recently been pointed out in two very informing articles in the Calcutta newspaper Capital,” an even larger amount estimated at 72,000,000 lbs. was produced and retained or consumed in India in 1915. Production 4. There is no official estimate of the quantity of W r ool produced in India, though there British India are official statistics of the number of sheep, and returns are also made by some of the Native States. “ Capital ” (p. 936) endeavours to correct these and estimates the number of sheep at 50 millions with an outturn of 125,000,000 lbs. There is, therefore, a large surplus retained and/or consumed in the country, firstly by the native industry of weaving blankets, rugs, shawls, &amp;c., of immemorial antiquity and practised throughout the country, and’secondly by the modern small but flourishing power loom industry, the out turn of which in 1915 was over 10,000,000 lbs.

The trade with a very small exception has since its inception been conducted under Methods of the system of “ Native Consignments,” which used to be common to almost all Indian ‘Trade produce; it may be briefly explained as follows : The grower sells his wool to the Pre-war “ consignor ” who receives advances from the European merchant houses often at the time ■ of purchase and usually some weeks, in some cases some months, before shipment is made; the consignor is responsible for the cleaning, grading and packing of the wool, and *“&lt;1 exporting merchant does not assume any responsibility until, to speak generally, shipping documents are put into his hands; up to this point, the merchant has been the consignor’s banker; he now becomes in addition the consignor’s agent. It is in the merchant’s name that most of the wool is exported, and it is in his own name alone that the wool is imported into Liverpool or into London in the case of certain wools from the Persian Gulf. On arrival the wool is valued by expert brokers who have made East India Wool their life study and is sold at periodic public auctions held every two months. The proceeds of sale are paid to the merchant who renders an account to India where a final settlement against each shipment is made with the consignor. 9. It will be convenient here to consider certain aspects of the trade on the Indian side. Methods We have heard it criticized as being out of date in its methods and capable of much suitable to improvement especially as to the preparation and cleanliness of shipments. As to the Indian methods, we believe these to be the most suitable to existing conditions in which the conditions Indian native plays and must play so predominant a part. It is on his efforts alone that reliance must be placed for collecting the wool into the different market centres, and so numerous are the various grades and qualities that it requires many years apprenticeship to become a skilled expert; probably the trade has run in families for generations, and it is a known fact that on the few occasions on which European merchants have entered the trade on their own account, the attempts have ended in failure; their intervention is not welcome to the native, and with the exception of a small direct business to America, any efforts have not been persisted in. Further, no pastoral industry can be said to exist, much less to flourish, in India in the sense understood in Australia; few if any flocks are bred with any definite object of producing good mutton or good fleeces. Foreign rams have it is true been imported occasionally, but efforts to improve the breed have been spasmodic only and confined to few localities, so that the effect on the total number of -sheep has been practically nil. However speedily progress may take place in the big centres of commerce and industry in the adaptation of Western methods the fact remains that much of the Wool is grown in tracts far removed from civilization and railways under 'Conditions little changed from primitive times, and it must be many years before any widespread improvement can be obtained even if the importation of suitable rams were ^energetically supervised by the Government. 10. As regards preparation and cleanliness, there is certainly much room for reform, and Improvement it must be admitted that the efforts of- the merchant houses have with few exceptions not in cleaning met with success; three reasons for this may be given :— necessary (a) The innate conservatism of the Indian native. ,(6) The climatic conditions under which much of the cleaning and washing is carried on. In many parts of the Punjaub and Rajputana, for instance, clean water, even water itself, is scarce, and the wool when washed is spread out to dry in the open air, freely exposed to sand storms. ^(c) The fact that the extra expenditure involved frequently fails to bring any adequate economic return. The American Tariff up to 1913 only permitted Wool below 6d. per lb. to enter at the lowest rate of duty (4 cents per lb.), hence competition for this class of Wool resulted in its selling at an unduly high price and further any attempt to discriminate adequately has in the past been frequently thwarted by the consignor’s recognised practice of imposing limits at the time of sale; sooner than lose the chance of obtaining his requirements, the buyer pays the price asked. It may be noted that no limits have been accepted since the War, but the Government schedule of prices was fixed at a time when the demand for the Wool was extraordinarily keen, so that the difference in price between clean and dirty shipments of the same quality was even less marked than usual. It is also strongly suspected that the general body of shippers, knowing that they held a practical monopoly of these wools in the United Kingdom worked in collaboration ho withhold supplies by the imposition of limits or otherwise, and it is an acknowledged fact that they controlled their operations over a series of years with remarkable intelli gence. In spite, however, of these reasons, undoubtedly great improvement is possible and the more enlightened amongst consignors are making serious efforts to accept the / 3advice proffered them; we know of shipments now regularly coming forward that give an outturn of even 95 % clean wool. To the prevailing conditions which make it impossible to purchase and ship the necessary machinery must be attributed the failure to show any more general improvement, and the merchant houses would gladly welcome the co-operation of the Government of India in any steps towards promoting this very desirable and necessary reform. PRESENT METHODS OF THE TRADE. Methods of 1U The War has brought no drastic changes with the exception that the manufacturing 'trade section of the trade has been brought into the general Government control system. The Present periodic auctions were increased to seven in the year 1914 and to eight in 1915 owing to the urgent requirements of manufacturers for war purposes; for the same reason the merchant houses refused to accept the imposition of limits; the Government of India, after first prohibiting export altogether, imposed a prohibition on all export except to the United Kingdom except under license. At the end of 1916 the British Government acting through the Army Contracts Department assumed control of all Wool on arrival in the Limited United Kingdom, but beyond fixing prices at the then current level and controlling the- Government sale and distribution to manufacturers, the trade as far as the consignor and the importing control houses are concerned has been left to itself. The only change in the status of the brokers is that they now value on behalf of the Army Contracts Department to the fixed schedule and not directly on behalf of the merchant; Distribution Sales are held every two months under the control of the Distribution Officer, appointed by the Government from the trade, and we gladly welcome this opportunity of placing on record our great appreciation of the services rendered by Mr. Rex Buckley in the occupation of this important and responsible post. This policy of non-interference with existing interests was the result of representa tions made to the Government by this Committee, and may be claimed to have amply justified itself, for not only has it resulted in a minimum of public expenditure, but the flow of Wool has been steadily maintained subject to tonnage restrictions, and there are at the time of making this Report some 40 45,000 bales awaiting shipment in Bombay and Karachi. United Kingdom as central market in normal times 12. We now pass from general matters to the particular and firstly to the ultimate markets of the raw Wool after sale in the United Kingdom in the pre-war period. From 1904/13 the average imports into Liverpool were ... 152,000 bales From 1910/13 „ ,, in London ,, ... 24,900 ,, Average annual total 176,900 „ 'hese were sold to the following destinations : — .. 34,997,360 lbs. average .. 11,866,120 ,, ,, The United Kingdom Continent, chiefly France U.S. of America Germany (London) 9&gt; 933 &gt;760 806,760 61 % 21 % 17 % 1 % 57,604,000 lbs. average =100 % United 13. From replies to an enquiry addressed to 120 British users and to such French firms Kingdom as are now' accessible, it appears that in the period 1904/1913, the proportion of East India Wool to their total consumption was— British Carpet, &amp;c. Manufacturers ... 70 % ,, Blanket ,, ... 60% ,, Felt ,, ... 60% and all are unanimous in saying that this Wool is an essential element in their productions; in addition a small but material percentage was used in the hosiery, cloth and worsted trades. All the above trades are of vital importance to the economic life of the Nation both as regards the home and the export markets. 14. French manufacturers replied in the same sense and it should be particularly noted in support of their views that the French Government exempt East India Wool bought in Liverpool from the duty imposed on Wools not imported direct into France. French buyers regularly attend the sales and select their requirements. 15. The American Market with its takings of 17 % has been particularly cultivated by the Liverpool brokers who keep in close touch bv correspondence and by personal visits.

American buyers occasionally attend the sales and select their requirements, but usually their orders are placed in the brokers’ hands, in which case considerable dis cretion is allowed and the brokers’ capacity for selection implicitly relied on. The position of Liverpool as a port of transhipment between India and America is eminently favourable, and shipment can usually be more easily and speedily effected than the similar operation on to railway trucks to Yorkshire. We IWieve that of the American demand fully 90 %, we do not place the figure higher fv ’fear of being suspected of exaggeration, has been continuously content with obtaining its supplies by purchasing in Liverpool and desires no change. Any evidence we have had of the wish to cultivate direct business between India and America has been in the interests of the merchant buyer and not prompted by the manufacturer. 16. By thus concentrating their purchases in Liverpool or London, French and American Advantage buyers secure the benefit of having the whole range of qualities from which to make their thereof selection with a minimum of expense to themselves, and thereby confer the maximum of advantage upon the general body of Indian consignors. 17. Secondly, it is of material importance to note how the trade is affected by the transfer United of the industrial activities of the country from peace to war conditions. There were Kingdom exported under license during the years 1915 17 an average quantity of 4,235 bales to the tn Continent, mostly France, and 13,694 bales to the LInited States of America. After allow- Ptw wd War ■ ing for these exports the effect of the transfer is shown in the following table :— compared Peace War Highest Year Average Imports. Liverpool. 1904/13 152.000 bs. 1915/17 182,672 ,, 1916 236,049 ,, London. 24,900 bs 11,630 ,, 16,320 ,, Lbs. 57,604,000 62,641,840 81,410,880 Peace War Highest Year Average U.K. Consumption. 1904/13 34,997,360 lbs. 56,804,160 ,, 1916 78,526,060 ,, or 136 % of the total average Peace imports of 57,604,000 lbs. These figures conclusively prove that however important East India Wool is to the economic and industrial life of the Nation in peace time, its importance increases enormously in war, and the known activities and output of the Indian Woollen Mills further confirm this assertion. We have endeavoured to obtain particulars from a number of representative users of their consumption of East India Wool and of the articles manufactured during the War as compared with their output in normal times, and the following table compiled from returns made by 63 manufacturers all but five of whom have been regular users of East India Wool since 1911 give some indication of the changes that have taken place : — No. of Total Average Users.

The demand for military and naval requirements has been enormous; East India Wool is eminently suitable for their manufacture, especially the dark grey and fawn colours, but the increase has been merely a great extension of peace trade with the Govern ment as practically the sole buyer.

The Wools from the Persian Gulf are peculiarly desirable from special characteristics of colour as well as of quality and are found indispensable in the making of Cardigan Jackets, Caps, and other hosiery equipment for our naval and military forces, to which practically the entire output has been devoted.

Owing to the shortage of leather this Wool has entered to a considera’ '; extent into the making of belts for driving machinery. 18. The above figures do not pretend to be exhaustive, and if any Department of Government receiving this Report would like further information in elaboration of the above table, we suggest that an application to the supply departments of the Government would elicit the necessary details without giving undue trouble. We think, however, that we have shown sufficient to prove our point that East India Wool is not only of great intrinsic importance for particular trades in peace and war, but the exigencies of war have revealed new uses for which it is eminently suited, and it can therefore be partially relied on to fill the gap caused by the known shortage in the finer qualities of clothing wools, which is the principal reason for the recommendations made by the Departmental Committee on the Textile Trades to provide for the certain difficulties of international trade after the War. 19. We are in addition convinced that the supply of the raw material obtainable from India is considerably larger than is generally supposed, and that the high figures of the 1916 exports could be maintained if sufficient tonnage can be provided and if prices continue at a sufficiently high level to attract wool from remote districts, especially from beyond the frontier, to centres whence it can conveniently be made available for Imperial trade. 20. In this connection we would mention that if Germany retains any economic hold over Russia she will do her utmost to obtain wool from the Khorassan, Herat and Afghanistan country which may be termed the watershed of the trade in this part of the world. The competition of Japan must also be reckoned with. She took an almost negligible quantity of this Wool before the War, and her great trading corporations had not then obtained any substantial hold of the markets of India, except perhaps in Cotton. Since the War started, however, one great business house has entered the Wool trade seriously and regularly continues to send consignments to Liverpool contrary to the export regula tions of the Government of India, and we believe there is great danger after the War of considerable shipments being diverted to Japan. RECOMMENDATIONS. 21. We therefore concur in the general conclusion of the Departmental Committee’s Report that it is of the highest importance to conserve the supply for the complete safe guarding of British Industrial requirements (p. 26) which on pre-war standards we have shown to be 61 %• of the imports into the United Kingdom. The maintenance of this per centage as an absolute minimum is vital for the well-being of the industry of the United Kingdom alone, and this will probably have an additional burden thrown upon it in pro viding for the needs of France in manufactured articles until the reconstruction of her own industry is complete; this reconstruction is likely to be very prolonged. 22. We further recommend that, inasmuch as Liverpool and London, the former with its ample warehouse accommodation specially built for this trade some years ago by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, have been proved to be the best centres for the distribution of our own requirements and for the supply of other countries, particularly France and the United States of America, the Government of India take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that for a period of not less than five years after the termination of hostilities all Wool (and Hair) shipped from India and the Persian Gulf be sent to the United Kingdom for sale. 23. For the further regulation of supplying our Allies, neutrals, and, eventually, our present enemies, so soon as supplies prove sufficient, we further recommend that control by licenses be instituted and that this East India Wool Trade Committee be recognised as the body competent to be entrusted under the supervision of the British Government with the task of recommending the necessary permits. 24. We particularly wish to emphasize that these recommendations are in no way inimical to the needs and interests of Indian consumers and manufacturers who would benefit by purchasing in the original markets of production. We believe that supplies available are amply sufficient to warrant free exports from India subject only to their being confined to the United Kingdom.7 mmuagrTTz- _ diS' WijMp—'' lSpensa blel f !?l : natal ^^ nd «'lietli,;. entered L ls . not only (i t es w 8 i?

We wish to draw particular attention to certain expressions of opinion, conclusions and recommendations contained in the Final Report of the Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy after the War (c.d. 9035) extracts from which we italicize. 6 In our opinion it will be necessary for the Government to give special con sideration to the circumstances of each trade, and any request for encouragement and assist ance should be dealt with not only on its own merits but in relation to the trade of the &lt;ficmntrv as a whole We confirm this. iog. The Resolutions of the Paris Conference which bear upon the matter (i.e., Control of Exports) are as follows : — B. /. The Allies declare their common determination to ensure the re-establishment of countries suffering from acts of destruction and spoliation and unjust requisition, and decide to join in devising means to secure the restoration to those countries, as a prior claim, of their raw materials, industrial and agricultural plant, stock and mercantile fleet, or to assist them to re-equip themselves in these respects.” B. III. The Allies declare themselves agreed to conserve for the Allied countries, before all others, their natural resources during the whole period of commercial, industrial, agricul tural and maritime reconstruction, and for this purpose they undertake to establish special arrangements to facilitate the interchange of these resources.” no. We stated that in our opinion effect could not be given to those Resolutions, unless export restrictions are placed during the transitory period upon a number of important articles, and that any measures undertaken for the purpose should aim at assuring to the British Empire and the Allies priority for their requirements, and at preventing the present enemy countries from gaining by the use of such materials an initial advantage in the com petition to recover markets which will follow the war. We fully concur. ii]-. We recognise that in addition to the proposals contained in our former Reports it will also be necessary to continue for some period after the War some portion of the control of home and foreign trade imposed during the War to which we have referred in the pre ceding paragraphs. It is not possible for us at the present time to specify the precise measures which will be required. They will depend upon a number of factors which can not be accurately determined without knowledge of the precise terms of peace and the conditions of industry at the time, more especially as regards the available supply of raw materials and of tonnage. .118. The primary need will certainly be to secure to the country adequate supplies of food stuffs and raw materials for industry and their fair distribution. For these purposes it will almost certainly be necessary that at the outset the Government should continue to con trol the allocation of tonnage. In addition, where supplies of raw materials are not likely to be available on a sufficient scale to meet all internal demands, some arrangements for joint purchase and apportionment will be required. Similarly, in view of the extent to which renewals and repairs to 7 nachinery will be needed, it may be desirable at the outset to regulate the execution of orders by means of a system of priority certificates. In the application of any such system regard must, however, be had, as stated in paragraph 3 of our Second Report of the 14th December, igi6, to the imperative necessity of encouraging dhe general export trade of the country. ng. In any steps which may be taken on the above lines the policy of the Government should, in our opinion, be so framed as to keep within the narrowest possible limits the restrictive measures which it may be necessary to continue, and should be directed towards the restoration of normal industrial conditions within the shortest possible time, subject ^always to the essential needs of the country and our obligations towards our Allies. Wherever practicable the trades concerned should themselves be entrusted with the working ■ of the control under Government authority. We entirely concur in the opinion expressed by the Trade Committees that Stale control of, and restrictions upon, industries arising out ■ of war conditions, which have been recognised and accepted as necessary during the war, ■ will be found to be detrimental under normal conditions, and we strongly urge that they should be removed so soon as possible after the conclusion of peace, regard being had to the circumstances of each particular case. The early restoration of unrestricted dealings in Paris Resolutions, Ac,the markets of this country and the world at competitive prices is essential to the re-establish^ merit of British industry and commerce on a sound basis. It is especially important, with a view to the maintenance of the foreign exchanges and the recovery of our position in the markets of the world, that our general export trade should be freed as soon as possible from all unnecessary restrictions, both as regards its nature and amount and the channels through which it would normally flow. We fully concur. 124. In this connection we should like to draw attention to Appendix I to the Final Report of the Dominions Royal Commission (Cd. 8462) and the “ Memorandum and Tables relating to the Food and Rave Material Requirements of the United Kingdom,”' published by the same Royal Commission in Kjij (Cd. 812j), in which for the first time an effort has been made to take, so far as the existing data permitted, a comprehensive survey of the requirements of the United Kingdom and of the Empire in respect of a wide range of Foodstuffs and Raw Materials of Industry, and of the extent to which those requirements are or might be met from the developed or undeveloped resources of the Empire. We entirely concur in the general recommendation of the Dominions Royal Commission (Page 66, Paragraph J32), that “'it should be the duty of some body or Department to collect from year to year information as to the requirements of the Empire in respect of commodities essential to its development, safety and well-being, and as to the output actual and potential, and to watch carefully any tendencies towards change.. Action of this kind lies at the root of any endeavour towards a wise utilisation of the resources of the Empire.’' We agree, especially in regard to the probable competition of the Japanese in India. 765 It is in our judgment very desirable that in all important British industries- there should exist strong, comprehensive, and well-organised associations which should be clearing-houses of information of common interest and should be competent to voice the opinions and needs of their respective trades as a whole. We think that the Government might well encourage the formation of associations of this character by treating them, when satisfied as to their representative character and efficiency, as the channels of communication with their respective trades in the distribution of official commercial information, and as the authoritative exponents of the opinions o f their trades in all matters in vjhich they are likely to be affected by legislative or administrative action. We agree and claim that the East Indian Wool Trade Committee which was formed in November, 1915, is such an Association. 215. With regard to other industries (i.e., other than “ key ” or “ Pivotal ” industries} the terms of our reference require us to consider specially what industries are essential to the future safety of the nation, and what steps should be taken to maintain or establish them. Obviously the whole range of the industrial production of the United Kingdom cannot be included within the category, and if the test of the advisability of State action is to be the importance of the industries, to which it is applied, for the promotion and security of the economic resources and industrial well-being of the nation, there is clearly a consider able number of industries which would be excluded. Nevertheless the list of industries which would certainly fall within the definition is a lengthy one — including, as it must, for example, the heavy iron and steel trades, and numerous branches of the manufacture of iron and steel goods; the engineering trades, including electrical a?id motor engineering; the production of a considerable number of non-ferrous metals and ferro-alloys; ship building; many branches of the chemical trades; the textile trades almost as a whole; the manufacture of various classes of rubber goods, especially tyres; and the leather industries* We claim that the East Indian Wool Trade falls within the definition. 228. In recommending the form of assistance which we think may fairly be tendered to 1 those branches of British trade which, during the period of reconstruction and probably later, may properly require Government help, we have borne specially in mind' the para mount importance of not entering upon any course of policy which may prejudice or injuriously affect our large export trade, upon the increasing volume of which the prosperity of the naMon so largely depends. 22g. The period immediately following on peace will be in many ways critical. Not the least important consideration will be the restoring of the foreign exchanges and the'?'«««!

To effect this essential result exports must be encouraged in every way, whilst all unnecessary imports must temporarily be discouraged. 2jo. Whatever may be the position with regard to the Empire as a whole, it is certain that this country is not, and cannot be, self-contained and self-sufficient. We rely, and shall, we think, continue hereafter to rely even more than in the past, upon imported raw f^terials. For the purpose of this consideration it is of little moment whether those raw materials are derived from within or without the Empire. The fact remains that the raw materials of our staple industries are mainly derived from abroad, and come to our manufac turers charged, with the cost of long distance freight. The exports of this country, with the exception of coal, are, in the main, those of manufactured goods, and in nearly all our exports we have to face the competition of Germany and the United States,—in a lesser degree that of France and Belgium; whilst in the future the competition of Canada, and especially of Japan, will have to be reckoned with. Whilst the United States is in the position of being self-supporting as regards the raw materials of some of its staple trades, Germany, like ourselves, is largely dependent upon imported raw material. 2ji. In the economic competition after the war, whilst organisation, the granting of credit, and efficient management will be important factors, the controlling factor of all, in our opinion, will be the ability of the exporting nation to manufacture and export its products cheaply. By this we mean that all elements of high-class production shall be available at bedrock prices, without any avoidable addition of imposts, freights or interest charges.

Whilst Europe as a whole may be said to be divided into settled fields of inter national competition, where local circumstances, convenience of transport, and suitability of production for local needs, have become the controlling factors, there remain vast markets still practically untouched for the future development of the exporting nations of the world. China, with its 400 millions of population, an old and industrious civilisation, must in the near future develop its already great and growing demands for products of our staple trades. There are great potentialities in India and there is also the demand of Siberia and the smaller Far Eastern countries, which are likely in future to afford profitable markets. 2jj. If is true that in this sphere the competition of Japan will have to be increasingly reckoned with, but we have no doubt that with a rise in the standard of living of the Eastern peoples there will come a corresponding increase of the quantity and improvement of the quality of the goods demanded. This development cannot fail to be of advantage to British industry, and for this reason, if for no other, we desire to emphasise the import ance of all measures, including particularly the rapid extension of railways, likely to promote the economic well-being of India. We agree, and the more especially as British India with certain countries adjacent thereto is the sole source of supply within the Empire of the Wools considered in this Report and provides a percentage of the World Production very materially less than is the case with Merino and Crossbred Wools. 26. The following extract from the summary of the Proceedings of the Imperial War •Conference at its meetings held on June 24th, 26th and 28th, 1918, was recently published : The next resolution related to the measures necessary lo secure for the British Empire and the belligerent Allies the command of certain essential raw materials to enable them to repair the effects of the war as soon as possible and so safeguard their industrial require ments. The conference agreed that this course was necessary, and expressed the opinion that the Governments of the British'Empire should make such arrangements among them selves as will ensure that essential raw materials produced within the Empire shall be available for the purposes named above, and should arrange with the Allied countries to utilise for the same purposes the essential raw materials produced in those countries. A further resolution in connection with the same question recommended that a committee of members of the conference should, first consider the possible methods of each part of the Empire obtaining command of the essential raw materials referred to in the previous resolu tion, and that the Governments represented at the conference should, in the light of infor mation collected by their representatives on this committee, consult with representatives of the producers and the tjades concerned as to the method of obtaining command best suited to each individual commodity. Imperial War Conference 9We have set out above what is in our opinion the best method of obtaining and retaining the command of East India Wools, and should welcome an invitation from the representa tives of the Governments alluded to should they desire any further information or discussion. Heme Office 27. We wish in conclusion to touch briefly on a subject which unless very carefully handled may completely disarrange this important trade. In October, IQ 1 ?? Sir William Middlebrook, M.P., the Chairman of the Home Office Departmental Committee Anthrax consulted this Committee and disclosed the recommendations which would probably be made. Our Committee had previously considered the desirability of examin ing the whole subject itself, but on the ground that two microscopes applied to the same material will show the same result decided to do nothing. While we await the final Report with some anxiety, we do ask and most strongly recommend that the Government of India, if and wffien the proposals come before it, should firstly enquire closely into the prevalence of anthrax amongst the wool sorters in India who must be equally and even more exposed to the same dangers of infection and, secondly, consult with those interested in the trade in India, namely, the export houses, the native shippers and the baling press owners, before coming to any decision.

To raise the question now might give rise to demands for such wool which it is desirable under present circumstances to avoid, I am further to draw Sir Laming 1 s attention to the fact that after the military requirements of Great Britain and France for Basra wool have been satisfied, there is practi cally no surplus remaining* Under these circumstances, the Council are of opinion that the proposed note to the United 10 ?lfl(jgl j refer 1 itober i y, considen at *11 on the 5 being sent / / States te Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W. 1.States Charge d’Affaires does not quite meet the case* The United States have not pressed for Basra wool, hut it is not improbable that they would object in principle to the pro posal that they should agree to make application only through British Channels. Furthermore, it could not be claimed in this case that Economy of tonnage would result by shipment in the first instance to the United Kingdom and it is not desired that the United States should present any demands for this wool* I am therefore to suggest for the consideration of Sir. L. Worthington Evans that either no communication at all should be made to the United States Government or that a.letter in the form of the attached draft should be sent. I am, etc., (Signed.) B.B. Cubitt.Sir, 1* I have the honour to bring to your notice certain changes recently made in the regulations governing the export of Baghdad wools from the port of Basra. In view of the fact that these wools have been found to be eminently suitable for the manufacture of Army Blankets for British and Allied military requirements, it has been decided that though the trade in Basra will continue to be carried im in the ordinary channels, it is desirable that all exports should be brought in the first place to this country, the object being' to ensure that these wools are utilised in this country and France for military purposes, at a reasonable price and with the greatest possible economy of tonnage. 2. As regards price, there are no means of appraising this wool in the East. It is therefore desirable that it should be brought to the market in this country in order to prevent speculative buying which would be likely to lead to prices rising very much higher than their present level. When the wool arrives and has been appraised it will be sold at fixed prices and the French demands will be considered pari passu with those of His Majesty's Government. 3®* As regards tonnage, it appears that no vessels are likely to sail direct with full cargoes from Basra to any other country but the United Kingdom. 4 e i therefore suggest for your Excellency's consideration that the principle, which has been agreed to between the United States Government and His Majesty's Government wherebj the latter have agreed to refrain from competing with the United States in the South American market, should be mu- tually recognised in the case of the Basra Market. 5 * i trust that Your Excellency will agree that these arrangements 'he United States Chargl d*Affaires.'Ol ’’ ’ ^ arrangements are satisfactory and in the general interests of the co-belligerents; and I should be grateful if you could suggest to the United States Government the desirabi lity of advising interested parties in the United States should the question arise that such consignments of wool must in future be shipped in the first instance to the United Kingdom,l -^ \V8559—H5668 40,000 9/17 HWV(P1637) H17/2014 Any further communication on this ; . subject should be addressed to — The Director, War Office (Raw Materials Department), i v Imperial House, Tothill Street, Westminster, London, S.W.l, j and J following number quoted :— 124/Wool/256 .A ./R.M.l Ja . \x tur/i AS WAR OFFICE (Raw Materials Department), Imperial House, Tothill Street, Westminster, S.W.l. &amp; h A 9 Q ^ l d™ * * Telegraphic Address:— “Dieawmat, London.” Telephone—V ictoria 8540. 19th November, 1918.

I am to state that the action of the Civil Commissioner in permitting the export per S.S, 'General Liman' of the 3,000 bales to Marseilles has seriously interfered with the control of Persian Gulf wool by the War Office, which you will no doubt agree is equally to the advantage of the British and French Government requirements.

In the case of the French we might he subjected to reprisal in Syria which is at present in French occupation. It was agreed however, that in future cases the Civil Commissioner at Baghdad should be instructed by the India Office to ask for instructions before granting permission for export. The Foreign Office agreed with the War Office that . » the system of control was to the advantage of the French Government equally with the British Government as after the military requirements of France and Great Britain had been satisfied there was practically •v ‘ ‘ ' • 1 no surplus available for Civil trade# The Foreign Office promised to take the matter up with the French Government, put before them the fait accompli, point out its advantages, and persuade them to concur in 'c ... , v • v its continuance.

' . &gt; in his cable for releasing the wool is that this s Steamer would otherwise have returned empty to Marseilles* He also states that there was a difficulty in obtaining tonnage for the shipment of Wools to the United Kingdom* The case has been referred to the Ministry of Shipping who can hardly believe that this steamer the 'General Leman' would have returned empty has she not carried these Wools and states that ii the total cargo carried comprised only these 3,000 Bales it is a waste of tonnage* The Ministry also states that as 1 the French Government has asked them to provide tonnage to lift Australasian Wool from Port Said to Marseilles the steamer 'General Leman” should have been used for this purpose* They are therefore making representations to the French Government on the subject* I am directed to ask you to bring this matter to the notice of the French Delegation and to explain to them that purchases in Basra on French Account (pre sumable/ k’* Barnes, C#I*K* Kingsway, W*C*2*(presumable blvil) are calculated to enhance prices find thus increase the cost of the Wools to the French and British Governments, In these circumstances I am to request you to enquire of the Delegation whether it is not possible for the French Government to take steps to control the operations of their nationals in Basra as a continuance of such purchases it is feared will prevent the British Government supplying Baghdad Wools from this country at fixed prices for the use of the French Government.

In the case of the French we might be subjected to reprisal In Syria which Is at present in French -ijL ■ Si Commissioner at Baghdad should be instructed by the India Office to ask for instructions before granting permission for export. the system of control was to the advantage of the French Government equally with the British Government as after the military requirements of France and Great Britain had been satisfied there was practically no surplus available for CiMl trade. Hie Foreign Office promised to take the matter up with the French Government, put before them the fait accompli, point out its advantages, and persuade them to concur in Its continuance It was pointed out by the War Off .ce that if the French Government insisted on their Nationals competing in the purchase of Persian Gulf wools in the interests of the 3¥ehch Civil Trade the War Office would have to consider the refusal of allocations of such wool for French military purposes. With regard to the case pending, concerning Basra wool Imported into the United Kingdom by Selwirn EomsSy &amp; Co. as a result of their failure to obtain an export licence from Basra to France, the Jar Office stated that their own opinion was that re-export to France should not be allowed, but that if the Foreign Office gave-instructions that the wool, for diplomatic reasons, must be released, the War Office would have to concur. This would apply to any other similar cases that might arise. It was agreed that the War Office should reply officially to the India Office criticising the^Gable from the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, dated 25th September 1918, and t.iauV, 4b80 b ji/oc/R.n.i.a.

One of the reasons mentioned by the Commissioner in his cable for releasing the wool is that this Steamer would otherwise have returned empty to Marseilles. He also states that there was a difficulty in obtaining tonnage for the shipment of Wools to the United Kingdom. The case has been referred to the Ministry of Shipping who can hardly believe that this steamer the 'General Leman' would have returned, empty has she not carried these Wools and states that if the total cargo carried comprised only these 3,000 Bales it is a waste of tonnage. The Ministry also states that as the French Government has asked them to provide tonnage to lift Australasian Wool from Port Said to Marseilles the steamer 'General Leman' should have been used for this purpose. They are therefore making representations to the French Government on the subject. I am directed to ask you to bring this matter to the notice of the French Delegation and to explain to them that purchases in Basra on French Account (presumably civil) are calculated to enhance prices and thus increase the cost of the Wools to the French and British Governments. In these circumstances I am to request you to enquire of the Delegation whether it is not possible for the French Government to take steps to control the operations of their nationals in Basra as a continuance of such purchases it is feared will prevent the British Government supplying Baghdad Wools from this country at fixed, prices for the use of the French Government. n Yours faithfully.

A memorandum will also be furnished on the subject of the sources of the wool affected by the arrangements made, and at the same time it is proposed to deal with the question from the point of view of shipping in view of the observations contained in the penultimate paragraph of the letter from your Department above referred to. I I am to suggest that as soon as the necessary memoranda are prepared a Conference on the subject should be held between members of your Department, the India Office, and the Raw Materials Section of the War Office, and I am to ask you to inform the Council whether you agree to this proposal. I am to add that the Army Council has been informed by the Secretary of State for India that a telegram has been received from the Civil Commissioners, Baghdad, in which he reports that he has authorised the despatch by French steamer of 3,000 bales of wool from Basra to Marseilles.

The Army Council regret that anything in the nature of a misunderstanding with the Foreign Office should have arisen in this matter. It presumes, however, that the Foreign Office will now take steps to inform the French Government of the arrangements made, with which the French delegates in this country are already familiar.

I am commanded by the Army Council to refer to your communication No. 156867/V1U7, dated 20th instant, with Enclosures, .regarding the shipment of Wool from Basra to France. With regard to Mr, Spicer's letter to the India Office, dated 19th instant, I am to point out that full particulars of the arrangements made with the Secretary of State for India were communicated to the Foreign Office in the letter from this Department, dated 13th July last. One of the objects the Army Council had in view in communicating so fully the particulars of these arrangements to the Foreign Office was to enable Mr. Secretary Balfour, should he think fit, to communicate them to the French Government. I am to point out that the French Government benefits equally with the British Government by the arrangements made. By arranging with the India Office to prohibit export from Basra except to the United Kingdom, the Army Council is able to control the price at which this wool is sold for Military purposes. The French Military requirements of such wool are arranged through the C.I.F. and allocations for France are made at the periodical distribution under the control of this Department. If, on the other hand, direct export from Basra was allowed to other Countries, the ele ment of competition would enter, and this Department's con trol of the price would be eliminated, with the result that all countries including Great Britain and France would be compelled to pay higher prices. Under these circumstances it/ Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W.I.| ! &amp;aa J X. Telegra/n i roin Poli’ticEl Ofiicfjr, BE^udcid, t»o t»Ji6 S6cr©t&gt;ciry of State. Dated 25th.

Her charter expired on arrival and she was about to return empty to Marseilles. ■ French Consul who is here on visit asked me as a special case to authorise despatch Dy this boat to Marseilles direct of 5000 bales of wool purchased some months ago. As ±im time allowed for loading is too short to permit of reference to London I have authorised this despatch and trust this step though contrary to previous orders will meet with approval for the following reasons. ( 1 ) Much wool sent from here by Government shipping via Port Said is reported still in Egypt and (? price) per ton claimed by Admiralty is regarded as ruinous by merchants. (2) Owing to (?difficulty^) of obtaining direct tonnage (2 I regret to report that) stocks have accumulated. (3) The 3,000 bales of wool are reported to be unsuitable for English market and in any case no early opportunity for shipment to United Kingdom seems likely to occur. (4) Recent refusal to permit shipment to France coupled with difficulty of obtaining tonnage to United Kingdom caused a good deal of heart-burning and to justify restrictions(s) of thi c V sort it seemed necessary to make exception in favour of irench boats returning empty to French port^. Lar^e proportion of wool/exported from Basra to Marseilles and (—dco^rupt group- (pg, r» n § * M^^ri^tandr-trherb-) prohibitions have been made use of oy ceroain parties here as argument to show Great Britain intends to adopt a policy of commercial exclusion in Irak even against her Allies.
