Mem or an dum: - As you are aware, Shaikh Abdullah bin Mohomed Saleh f s appointment as one of the three Shia Qadis has been cancelled owing to his conviction in the case of Mirza Hussein’s estate. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad considers it essential that there should be a third Shia Qadi and indeed this is very necessary. There are no suitable people in Bahrain to undertake this work. The only possible candidates are Shaikh Khalaf, who has twice been dismissed from his office for malpractices and one Mohomed al-Medani who also recently misappropriated 7,000/- which belonged to some orphans. m 2. His Excellency wishes to obtain a man from Iraq to act as the third Shia Qadi. He considers that this would put an end to the present feud between the followers of the ex-Qadi and the two acting Q,adis. Until a third Q,adi is appointed there will be constant H. B.

His Excellency has asked me to request you to enquire from the government of T Iraq whether they could recommend a candidate w T ho has been educated in Shera law either from the iVakf department or from one of the schools in the Holy cities. It is not necessary that the candidate should have previous experience as a judge in the Shera court. One of the present Qadis in Bahrain is entirely new to the work. The present Qadis are paid Rs 100/- per month but in the case of a foreigner it would be neces sary to give him a larger stipend than this amount.Political gene/, rio.ooh-O/v. tut i)tn lccuabt:r Tiob.

In connection with the suggestions for forming a department for the administration of property of orphans, mentioned in my letter No. 162/26-9A dated April 10, 1937, I have the honour to inform you that a number of the leading Bahama have made representations to the Bahrain Government complaining that two of the three Shia ^adis, Shaikh Aly bin Hassan and Shaikh Aly bin Ja ! far are unfit to be Q,adis and have misappropriated money from a certain estate recently administered by the Shara Court. 2. Owing to this I think it is unlikely that any arrangement such as suggested in my letter will be possible at present. A deputation of Bahranis called on me today and requested that the Government should take over administration of minors 1 estates assisted by a local committee. The petitioners produced —s produced a long letter containing allegations against the two Qadis. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, adviser to the Government.Translation. %\ © To His Highness Shaikh Sir Ifemad. After Qompliment^:- I have received a copy of a long letter signed by some Bahama complaining about two of the Shia Q,adis. It was brought by Abdu Ali bin Re jab, Muhsin Tajir and Syed Saeed. The truth of the matter is that none of the Shia Mutawwas in Bahrain are in any way educated or suitable for the responsible position of Qadis. I suggested to the petitioners that thebnly satisfactory arrangement would be for the Government to employ a Q,adi from t Iraq &gt; and to change him every two years. In my opinion the cause of the trouble is n fitna n among the baharna and the quarrels among the Qadis themselves and certain persons in Manamah, also the Qadis, as is their custom, have been acquiring too much money from estates of minors. The petitioners stated that they wished the Govern ment to deal with estates of minors, aided by a committee. It appears that the petitioners want some sort of enquiry into the r,.atter. As the Qadis are appointed by the Government that is a matter for the Government to decide. As Your Highness is aware the case against Shaikh iibdullah bin Liohomed Saleh is still being tried by the Shera Court. It would be scarcely suitable to examine charges against the two Qadis until the case has been finished. I enclose a letter from the Qadis explaining by what right they obtaned certain sums from the estate of Isa al-Khor. I cannot give an opinion as to whether their action was in accordance to Shera Law but the public consider itit v/as matter not. I await Your Highness 1 views on the Salaams, Sd/ C. D. Belgrave.

For the first six months he will be on probation and if his appointment is approved it will be for three years. 3.

In his letter No.365-G/6, dated 9th December 1935, Loch reported that the Bahrain Government could obtain a suit able man through personages in Iraq known to Shaikh Abdullah, and, for reasons given,/ recommended this mode of recruitment, of which Sir Trenchard Fowle approved. (Subsequently, however^ a Bahraini was appointed, vide your memorandum No.l57-G/6, dated 19th April 1957;.

Captain T. Hickinbotham, I.A., Political Agent, BahrainConfidential . D.O. No. -G/6.V.0. The 12th October 1937. My dear Mr. Caroe, Reference your demi-official letter No. 680-S dated the 7th October 1937 and Colonel Loch*s letter No. 365-G/6 dated the 9th December 1935, paragraph 3. ^ 2. There are new grounds that in my opinion render it inexpedient to follow the procedure which was envisaged in paragraph 3 of Colonel Loch’s letter under reference. The situation in ’ Iraq at the moment is not what it was in 1935 and it is not certain whether Shaikh Abdullah bin ’Isa would be able to obtain a suitable man as he might have done in 1935. The Bahrain Government did not pursue their original intention of 1935 of obtaining a Oadhi from ’Iraq but turned their attention to the mainland rather unsuccessttilly. I have discussed this matter very fhlly with Belgrave and his view is| and I agree with him, that the Bahrain Government would be much more likely to obtain a responsible and relia ble individual by applying through official channels than they would be through private and personal channels. I agree that the appointment of a Qadhi is an internal matter and the responsibility for the appointment of such people should rest primarily upon the Ruler but at the same time we are ourselves closely interested in the administration of justice in the Shera Court as the Shiah Qadhis deal largely with the Persian population for whom we are responsible. I consider that we should assist the Ruler in every way we can to obtain the right individual by the procedure which I have sug ested. V e will/- i ii . The Hon’ble Mr. O.K.

Dalrymple Belgrave, Esquire, C.B.E., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. To His Britannic Majesty’s Political .agent, Bahrain. Sin, I have the honour to refer to the corres pondence regarding the Shia Shera Court ending &gt; , with your No. 312-G/6-V.Q. dated 19th September 1937. 2. The present position is most unsatis factory. .The Shera Court, which consists of three Qadis, is incompetent, not impartial and completely under the influence of various poli tical parties who play one &lt;*,adi off against the other. There are no suitable 'Alims” in Bahrain who could be appointed in place of the present Q^adis. 3. The Bahrain Government decided some time ago that a senior Shia Q,adi or Mufti should be appointed to preside over the Shera Court. Efforts were made to find a suitable person in Hassa but owing to the notoriously quarrelsome reputation of the Shias in Bahrain none of the Shia Ulemas from the mainland would take employ-employment in Bahrain although they were offered generous terms. 4. At one time it was suggested that Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa Alkhalifah might be able to obtain an Alim from Iraq but this is now out of the question as the persons whom he might have approached are no longer in the Government. 5. The Bahrain Government would be obliged if you could possibly enquire through the authorities in Baghdad whether the Judi cial department of Iraq Government could re commend a suitable man on the terms which I mentioned in my letter No. 994/26 dated 18th September 1937. The only alternative to a ^adi from Iraq would be a Persian, and this for political reasons is obviously impossible. 6. The Shia population in Bahrain is probably about 100,000 persons, the majority of whom are Bahrain subjects, so the duties and work of the Shia Shera Court are more important than that of the Sunni Court. 7. The state of the Shia Court has been a legitimate subject for criticism for some time and the Government is anxious to put an end to this criticism which until now has been local but may very possibly become the subject of press propoganda.

N.o. 114/26 Bahrain, March 19, ' lo ' ?Q Dear Weightman, x I have heard, unofficially, that the Iraq. Government are recommending as a Qadi one Shaikh Abdulhussein Alhulli, who sounds from all I hear of him, a most suitable person. He is however a man of considerable experi ence earning £25. a month now, and he will not come for less than £30. a month. I have discussed the matter with the Shaikhs who agree to pay £30. for this man provided that he acts in the dual capacity of Qadi and teacher of religious law. We propose to start a special school in religious law for certain picked young Shia men. It is a thing that the public have been asking for for some years and at present there are no suitable persons here to give instruc The terms we now suggest for this particular man are: pay £30 per month, second class rail and steamer passages from Baghdad to Bahrain and similar return fares after three years. The agreement in the first place to be for three years, leave to be earned at rate of 45 days for each year of service but not to be taken until completing the three years. I should be obliged if you would communicate these facts to the authority concerned in Iraq. Yours sincerely H. Weightman, Esquire, I.C.S H.B.M f s Political Agent, Bahrain.C onfidential N©.y9-G/6.

For your Information, the Bahrain Governawsnt had heard unofficially of Shaikh Abdul Husain al Kllli, whom they consider very suitable. In the circumstances it seems preferable to leave the Bahrain Government to settle the terms of the contract direct with the candidate they select, and I am advising them accordingly in order to avoid (possibly protracted ) negotiations via the Agency, the Residency, the Embassy and the Iraq Government, none of uhora are oirectiy concerned. If you see no objection, we suggest that the thanks of the Bahrain Government may be conveyed to the Iraq Gov ernment for their assistance, and that the latter be in formed that the Bahrain Government propose to settle direct with the candidate selected the terms of the contract.

Concerns were raised regarding the local Shia Qadis who had been quarrelling with one another and allowing their personal animosity to influence their legal decisions. Hence, communications with the British Embassy in Baghdad were made to ask for advice on obtaining a man from Iraq to act as a third Shia Qadi in Bahrain. Later in the file it is stated that Shaikh Abdul Husain Alhilli from Iraq was appointed to act as Qadi and teacher of religious law in Bahrain. Terms and conditions of his recruitment were discussed in the correspondence. Other letters were sent by the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain to the local Qadis to discuss their roles.The main correspondence is between the Political Agency, Bahrain, the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Charles Dalrymple Belgrave.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Abdul Husain Alhilli</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Judicial appointments</topic></subject><subject><topic>Judges</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0002a4#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
