Dear Baggallay I return the map which accompanied your letter S.36/38/34 of ?th February about the ,-tfiglo-Iranian Conqpany^ new concession. such a small scale as to be of little use, though as far as can be seen, the Company's application seems to be generally unobjectionable from the Admiralty point of view. There are, however, two points referred to in the letter of the 8th December from the Company to the Foreign Office which we find somewhat disturbing :- (a) At one point the boundary is apparently defined in relation to territorial waters 'as laid down by Iranian Law', though it is simultaneously fixed by the geographical co-ordinate. (b) The Company say quite definitely that at the mouth of the Shatt, the boundary they have drawn crosses at the two angles the boundary line adopted by Departments in this country, of which a sketch was put at the Company's disposal. The use of the phrase 'territorial waters' mentioned at (a) above may in fact be quite harmless, but, without seeing the full context, it is impossible to be certain. importance. Although it has been decided here that the best division between Iraqi and Persian waters at the mouth of the Shatt would be a line equidistant from both coasts, the Iranians, so far as we know, have never been acquainted with our views and obviously this is a case where sleeping dogs would best be left to lie. On the other hand, if the Persian Government grant a concession relating to the bed The map of the area forwarded by the Company is on As regards (b), this cannot but be a matter of some H.L. Baggallay, Bsq., Foreign Office, S.W. 1. of • • • • •of the sea on the Iraqi side of this line, it is difficult to see how we can possibly ignore it unless we take refuge in the fiction (which would clearly be exploded if the issue were ever put to legal test) that we have no knowledge of the exact terras of the concession. ^hile it is true that internationally the bed of the sea may be appropriated by a state outside its own territorial waters, it seems equally clear that this appro priation may not extend to land under territorial waters of another State. To acquiesce, therefore, in a concession covering land or waters outside the proposed boundary shown to the Company would make it very difficult, if not impossible, to uphold that line. If the encroachment of the area for which the Company have asked beyond this line is very slight, and in no way endangers Iraqi control of the Rookah Channel* acquiescence in the grant of the concession accordingly might not have any serious practical effect; though it would in any event mean that the concession line would in future be the furthest to which we could hope to extend Iraqi territorial waters and would probably represent a purely arbitrary division unrelated to any conceivable principle for the settlement of such matters. Hone of these Important Issues can, however, be settled without an exact knowledge of the course of the limits of the proposed concession area in this neighbourhood. We would, therefore, be glad if you could obtain a full definition of the marine boundary of the proposed con cession area (a record of which is assumed to be available at their London office) without delay so that these doubtful points may be investigated. '* l here can be very little time remaining for intervention in this matter, since, as we now gather from the Company’s earlier letter of the »^9th December, the definitionmmem 0 2 ^ 3. 1152 | definition maps ”are at the moment at Tehran for signature”. It will clearly he much more difficult to secure any rectifi cation of the limits once the maps are signed hy the Iranian authorities, and we feel strongly, therefore, that the Company should he pressed to delay negotiations, unless the maps are already signed, while the doubtful points can he cleared up. It might he pointed out to the Conqpany that if the concession does involve Iranian claims to jurisdiction ^rer waters which we could not recognise, we shall prohahly find ourselves obliged to enter reservations with the Iranian Government. The undesirability of our having to do so, as it were, against a British Conqpany, will no doubt he obvious. I am sending copies of this letter to Gibson and Starling, Yours sincerely.(E 7X38/301/34) 7960 FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 29th Noveraher, 1938. «o Q i &gt;*-/ Deer Mr. Mylles, I am sorry that we have 'been so long in giving you our considered views on the various questions connected with the definition of your area in Iran, which were raised in your conversation with Baggallay on the 7th September. * The delay is due to the fact that we have had to consult other Government Departments, and have had to examine a number of rather complicated points. 2. You asked for our views on the following three que&amp;tions: (i) whether His Majesty’s Government would raise any objection to the maritime boundary of the concession area being drawn, in places, outside the three mile territorial limit; (ii) what is the position as regards the high seas, and (iii) how to draw the boundary at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab. Qu e stions/ g.. Mylles, Esq. Anglc-Iranian Oil Company.Questions (i) and (ii). 3. as regards the maritime portions of the Company’s concession, the obvious intention is that the Company should have the right to extract oil, not from the sea water, but from the land under the sea . We thinx that this is the principle on which the Company should work in defining the maritime portions of their concession, i.e. they should concentrate on 'sea bed' rather than 'waters', for in this way it should be possible to avoid altogether the difficult question of territorial waters. 4. Now, in this country, minerals appear unquestionably to vest in the Crown inside the three mile limit. Outside the three mile limit, i.e. under what His Majesty’s Government consider to be the high seas, they appear to vest in the Crown if and when they are effectively occupied by a mining company. it is, moreover, the generally recognised view of international law, with regard to the bed of the open sea ana the subsoil beneath it, that the sea-bed and the subsoil is res nu llius, but that it is capable of acquisition by effective occupation in the same manner/manner as any unoccupied territory atoove the level of the sea* The position, therefore, as regards the sea-hed off the Iranian coast is that up to the three mile line we recognise the sea-hed as being Iranian. Beyond that line the Iranian Government regard the sea-bed as Iranian up to the six mile line, and may possibly, now or at some future date, claim that ’’national interests” give them the right of control to mineral deposits up to the twelve mile line. In the view of His Majesty's Government, however, the subsoil outside the three mile line is res nullius and can be acquired only by effective occupation. 5. Our advice, therefore, to the Company is as follows: (i) The Company should obviously not lay claim to more sea-bed than they really think: they want, because of the danger of wasting their precious 100,000 square miles on territory to which they might not subsequently be able to establish a title. (ii) The Company should be virtually safe vis-a-vis of Iran in including areas up to the three mile line, and probably up to the six mile line.(iii) Between the six and twelve mile line, rights could probably be acquired by effective occupation. The Company, however, could not expect any support from His Majesty’s Government in any claim for areas beyond the three mile line which they had not effectively possessed, since, in the view of His' Majesty’s Government, the mere granting of a concession is not in itself sufficient to establish national or proprietary rights to the sea-bed under the high seas. Therefore, once the area has been defined and accepted by the Iranian Government, the Company would be well advised to take immediate steps to establish effective occupation, as far as is reasonably practicable, of those parts which are outside the three mile line. For such occupation of these parts to be effective, it would probably be necessary to erect on them artificial constructions and derricks, and it would not be enough merely to ring them round with buoys. it would be very unsatisfactory if the Company included in its claim areas from which it were later found impossible to exclude interlopers• At the same time the Company would not, of course, wish to omit areas in which they might/might be interested and which the Iranian Government might at some future date claim the right to grant to another concern,, (iv) That part of the concession which refers to the maritime area should be worded so as to apply to 'sea-bed' rather than to 'waters' and the limits should be expressed as geographical co-ordinates in order to avoid any relationship to territorial waters* (v) It is presumed that the Company will ensure that no danger to navigation will be involved by the occupation and development of areas of the sea bed outside the three mile line. we should, however, be glad if the Company would let us have a chart showing their proposed claim as soon as they have finally settled it, in order that this point may be checked. we should, moreover, expect the Company, before beginning operations on what we consider to be high seas, or in the neighbourhood of the Shatt-el-Arab, to consult with us and make all provision which we may consider necessary for the/the safety of navigation and the protection of any pre-existing rights of His Majesty’s Government or the Arab States, and for the prevention of oil pollution. These are matters which will need detailed consideration at a later stage. (vi) Outside the twelve mile line the position as regards the acquisition of rights is as explained above, i.e. similar to that outside the three mile line. It would hardly he desirable for the Company to include areas outside that line within their 100,000 square miles area, and in any case I gather fram what was said at the meeting that the Company have no intention of doing so. Question (iii). 6 . We should have no objection to the Company drawing their boundary close to - though we should prefer that it did not actually coincide with - the line dividing Iranian from Iraqi territorial waters as His Majesty’s Gyvernment conceive the line should most fairly be drawn, i.e. the locus of points equidistant from the Iraqi and Iranian coasts. a drawing is enclosed giving the line as12. accepted interdepartmentally here. This is for your confidential information only and should not he communicated to the Iranians. Your line here as elsewhere should, of course, he described hy geographical co-ordinates without reference to any division of territorial waters. (Signed) O. YV.

EziSLJ ADMIRALTY, S.W.l. 9th November, 193:^. H«L.Ba#gallay ^sq., Foreign Office, S.W.l. Dear Baggallay, Will you please refer to your letter S«5M8/Ml/$4 of the 11th October, about the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company’s ne^ concession? The Questions on which you require our views are - (i) What limit should the Oil Company be asked to adopt at the rnouth of the ohatt-el-Arsb? (ii) Is there any objection to the seaward limit of the concession extending beyond the 3 mile limit? (iii) What is the position as regards oil workings on the High &gt;eas? /vs regards (i), the important point is to secure that (a) the navigational channel from the Shatt is not impeded by oil workings, and (b) that the Persians do not acquire through the grant of a concession de facto claims to waters which we wish to be regarded as Iraq territorial waters. We consider that the best course would be for the Oil Company to avoid approaching sufficiently near to any possible dividing line between Iraq and Iranian waters to prevent the question of the division being brought into controversy. It will make a satisfactory settlement even more difficult to achieve if oil is discovered near or beneath waters still in dispute. On the other hand, we understand that the oil company wishes to secure at least sufficient submarine territory in this area to prevent a second company intruding, and, as it would by no means suit our interests for a rival company less amenable to official advice to become interested inin this area, we would not object to the Anglo-Iranian Company, if they consider it necessary, drawing their boundary close to or along the 'blue line” - i.e. the locus of points equidistant from the Iraq and Iranian coasts, which H.&amp;*Ck&gt;vernment wish to propose as the dividing line between Iraq and Iranian waters. It will of course be necessary for them to describe the concession limit by geographical co-ordinates, without reference to any division of territorial waters. As regards (ii) and (iii) we agree generally with the views expressed in your letter of 11th October. It is true that under the terms of the Oil Company’s agreement they are to lay claim to a stated area of Persian territory, and that it might be armied that anything which we allow them to claim, under that definition, without protest, we tacitly recognise as Persian territory. Presumably the Foreign Office will consider whether we should not at an early stage make it clear to the Persian Government that, while we do not wish to dispute the concession, we do not recognise that it affects in any way the position of H.M. Government in rega* d to the limits of Persian territorial waters, or that rights can be established over the sea bed under the high seas before possession has been made effective. We should have, however, to be careful not to prejudice thereby our claims in respect of the Arab pearl fisheries. It might be as well to make it clear to the Company that they could not expect support from H. .Government in any claim for areas beyond the three mile limit which they had not effectively possessed, as the mere granting of a concession is not in itself sufficient to establish national or-3- or proprietary rights to the sea bed under the high seas. A further point is that on the principles accepted above there is no real reason why the Company should limit its claims to the distance of 12 miles. The limits of 6 and 12 miles derive authority only from a Persian claim which we cannot recognise; and once the 3 mile limit is passed there is no special virtue in any further limit of 6 or 12 miles. We assume, however, that you mention the limit of 12 miles simply on the presumption that the Persians would not attempt to grant concessions beyond that limit, and there is no need therefore for the Anglo-Iranian to stake any more extensive claim. The concession area which the Conroany appears, from the record of your conversation ?'ith Myites, to have in view would be generally satisfactory in that it will not be directly associated with any limit of territorial waters. There would be obvious dangers if, for instance, the limits of the area claimed coincided entirely or largely with either the 6 mile or the 12 mile limit. ?rom a preliminary examination it does not appear that the proposed concession would encroach anywhere (except at the ?hatt) on our essential interests, or that it is necessary at this stage to make any specific stipulations in the interests of navigation. The company might be asked, however, to forward a chart showing their proposed claim as soon as they have finally settled it in order that this point can be checked. Also they might be warned that we would expect them, before commencing operations on the high seas or in the neighbourhood of the Shatt, to consult with H.:vi.(Government, and to make all provision which we may consider necessary for the safety of navigation and the protectionour protaction of any pre-existing rights of ourselves or our \rab clients and for the nrevention of oil pollution. These are all natters which will need detailed consideration at a later stage. I am sending copies of this letter to Qibson and Starling. Yours sincerely, C&amp;d.} T . Ski£30/ Dear Baggallaj, I am vritin^ to you with reference to your letter of 11th October (B.526&amp;/£01/34} about certain problems regarding the definition of the ^nglo-Iranian Company’s 100,000 square miles claim in Persia, I h&amp;Ye the following observations to make on the three points raised in your letter:- (1) The Three-mile Lioiit question . The issue on this point, as we see it, is whether F. \ Government would be prejudiced, e.^., from the fisheries point of view, if Persian claims to rights outside the three-mile belt were recognised by implication. This is, of course, not really a question for the Petroleum Department, from our point of view the balance of advantage in this matter is probably to secure the recognition of rights to acquire minerals as far out as possible from the coast-line of a country so long as an effective method can be found for doing this. But if, as I think we should, we accept Beckett’s idea that the Company’e claim should be in relation to sea bed rather than to waters, the point in regard to fisheries probably does not really arise. B. L. Baggallay, TCsq., roreign Office, l.%( 3 ) The uueation of the hiah It seems that there are Leveled zones to be considered unquestionably lereian territorial waters. Then there is the zone between three and six miles where lersia claims territorial rights. Outside that is the zone between six and twelve miles, known to some authorities, I believe, as the 'approach zone’ 1 , where Persia claims certain rights but perhaps not rights in relation to the sea bed. finally, there are the high seas proper outside the twelve-mile line. In this country minerals appear unquestionably to vest in the ...rown i.e., under our high seas, they appear to vest in the Grown if and when they are effectively occupied by a mining company. This is an illustration of the important point made in Beckett’s of £nd March, 1937, paragraph £, on the Gulf of Paria case referred to in paragraph 6 of your letter under reply; and which as far as we can understand is generally agreed, namely, that outside territorial waters, rights to underground land may be acquired by effective acquisition or occupation^ although in this case I believe it is contemplated that the 1 acquisition or ^iiere. First, there is the three-mile zone which is inside the three-mile limit. Outside the three-mile limit minute quoted by you (see for instance, Foreign Officf letters A. 878/878/47 of 16th larch, 1936, paragraph 6 and A.409/47/47, occupation will be established by the two Governinente. ve feel, therefore, that the edvice to the Conpuny should be something like this:- (i) They should obviously not lay claim to more sea bed than they really thinJk they want, becius* of the danger of wasting some of their precious 100,000 square milee on territory to which they might not subsequently be able to establish a title; (ii) They should be virtually safe in claiming up to the three-mile line, and probably up to the six-mile . line; (iii) Between the fIa and twelve-mile line, rights could probably be acquired by effective occupation, that is to say, presumably by luaJfciric artificial constructions and erecting derricks. Once the area has been defined and accepted by the Iranian Government, the Company would be well advised to take immediate steps to establish effective occupation as far as is reasonably practicable. I do not see that we can be at all certain that ringing round the area with buoys would be enough. It will be very unsatisfactory if the company includes in its claim areas from which it is later found impossible to exclude interlopers.-4- (1y) Outside the twelve-mile line the position as to acquisition of rights is the same as in (iii) but it would 9 I think, hardly he desirable to include such areas within the 100,000 square miles claim, and in any case I gather from the note enclosed with your letter that the Company are not interested in territory outside the twelve-mile line (v) $e fully agree with Beckett's and your idea that the definition of such a concession should be worded so as to apply to sea bed rather than to waters. Also, words like those proposed by Beckett in the minute which you quote, defining the concession as areas 'belonging to' the Persians, seem to us right. This case raises the difficult question of artificial islands. On this point our researches have unearthed the interesting case of the Fddystone Lighthouse. The Lighthouse was built on a rock, a about ten miles from the ]&gt;evon cast, not permanently above high water and therefore may , I suppose, be in some respects comparable with the artificial steel and concrete islands which the Anglo-Iranian Company would probably hare to build. (Actually, I fattiermmm - 6 - mean the same as “the prolongation of the final section of the left bank of the river' (paragraph $&gt; of your note of &gt; h September}, I gather that the line which H.i . Govnrnment thinks should be the international boundary (referred to in paragraph 7 of your letter of 11th October) is the Blue Line, I can quite well see that there are reasons why you would prefer that the boundary of the concession did not coincide with any of the suggested international boundaries. In the circumstances 9 it seems to us that BC, or something like it, would be &amp; satisfactory line for the concession boundary, although it may not include the largest possible area of sea bed.

Foreign office, s.w.i. 6994 | llth October, 1938, 1938 Dear Gibson, I enclose herein a record of a discussion which I had last month with Mylles, Lees and Browne, of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company, arising from their wish to have some advice about the best way of defining the Company’s concession area in Persia, which, as you know, has to be done before the 31st December, 1938. You will see that we were concerned with three points, namely: (1) Whether His Majesty’s Government would raise any objection to the maritime boundary of the concession area being drawn, in places, outside the three mile territorial limit, (2) How to draw the boundary at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, and (3) What is the position as regards the High Seas. 2. Since the meeting I have been able to confirm that what I said about the High Seas, as recorded in paragraph 11 of the enclosure, was correct, and that the generally recognised/ J.P. Gibson, Esq.\ 6994 1958 J recognised view of international law with regard to the bed of the open sea and the subsoil beneath it is that the sea bed and the subsoil is res nullius , but that it is capable of acquisition by effective occupation in the same manner as any unoccupied territory above the level of the sea. 3. During the meeting, however, it escaped my mind that questions (l) and (3) above were dealt with in recent correspondence between the India Office and ourselves about the concession to be granted to Petroleum Concessions Limited in the ’’Bahrein Unallotted Area”. In that case, too, the question arose how to define the maritime boundary of the concession, and our point of view was explained in a minute by Beckett enclosed in Brenan f s letter to you No. E 2288/413/91 of the 25th April, 1938. In this minute Beckett pointed out that as far as the maritime regions of the concession were concerned, the obvious intention was that the Company should have the right to extract oil from the land under the sea , and that although the Sheikh of Bahrein had at present no right to land under the sea outside the three mile limit, it is recognised that the bed of the sea and the land under it is capable of acquisition/recommended that it would be better to substitute for the word 'waters' in the draft concession the words 'submerged 'land', the effect of which would be to give the Company the right to the land below the sea immediately v/ithin the three mile limit and also outside the three mile limit as soon as they had appropriated it . 4, Now I think this suggestion of Beckett points to the means we are looking for of evading the difficulty about territorial waters which presents itself, or seemed to do so, in the case of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s concession in Persia* Since my discussions with the Company’s representatives I have looked up the Persian law about territorial waters. Copies of this law were sent to you under cover of Foreign Office letter No.T 8364/4148/380 of the 3rd August 1934 and a further copy is enclosed herein for convenience of reference* You will see from Article I that although the Persians claim the right of control to a distance of twelve miles from the coast, they ley specific claim to the bed of the sea only as far as six miles. Possibly, however, they would maintain that 'national interests' entitle them to control of mineral deposits/11 i © r* u N 1938 deposits up to the full twelve mile limit.— 5. We would suggest, therefore, that the Company should place the limits of their concession, wherever they wish to do so, up to a distance of twelve miles from the Persian coast, making it clear that the areas included beyond the coast are areas of sea bed * This would prevent the possibility of the Persian Government, at some future date, claiming the right — which, owing to the diversity of views about territorial waters, it would be difficult to dispute - to grant to another concern portions of the sea bed inside the twelve mile limit in which the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company might be interested. Prom the Persian point of view the entire area within the limits drawn by the Company would then be Persian territory. Prom the point of view of His Majesty’s Government, however, the area as delimited would consist of Persian territory only up to the three mile limit, and as regards the parts of the sea bed outside that limit which the Company would have included in their concession area, the Company would not really have a right to them - as being under the High Seas - until they had taken steps to appropriate them. As we are presumably not in the least anxious that these areas/6994 'iZ- [ 1958 J areas should be appropriated by anybody else, both the Persians and ourselves would be perfectly happy. 6. You will also be aware that in July 1936 our Legation at Caracas were instructed to initiate discussions with the Venezuelan Government with a view to the Governments of Trinidad and Venezuela taking simultaneous and parallel action to divide up as national territory between them the sea bed of the Gulf of Paria or such parts of it as might be of use for oil boring. 7. As regards question (2) namely the best way of drawing the boundary of the Company’s area at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, (referred to in paragraph 9 of the enclosed record), it has since occurred to me that the Company should draw their boundary here in such a way as to keep clear of the line dividing Persian from Iraqi territorial waters, as His Majesty’s Government conceive the line should most fairly be drawn (i.e. the principle that a ship is always in the waters of the country to whose coast it is closest.) The difficult about the Company doing this would, I think, be that they could not give any/1938 any satisfactory explanation to the Persian Government^if the latter were inquisitive about their reason for drawing the line in such a peculiar way, since it would have no geological justification. So far as geology is concerned, the Company^ desire is to get as much of the sea bed as they can in that part of the world. 8. I should be grateful if you would let me know as soon as you can if you agree with the foregoing views, or if you have any comments to make. I am sending a similar letter to Jones (Admiralty) and Starling (Petroleum Department) and am sending a copy to the Board of Trade.COPY. Anglo-Iranian Oil Company^ Concession Area. (E 5262/201/34). V, I 1958 J Mr. Mylles, of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, called on Mr. Baggallay this afternoon, accompanied hy Dr. Lees, the Company’s Chief Geologist and Mr. W.E. Browne, the Company’s Surveyor, in order to ask advice about the best way of defining the limits of the area or areas totalling 100,000 square miles of Persian territory which the Company were now obliged, before the 31st December 1938 and under the terms of the 1933 Concession Agreement, to choose as those in which they wished to operate their concession for the future. 2. Mr. Mylles and his colleagues explained that up to certain depths of water modem boring machinery made it possible to tap oil fields lying under the sea and that there were parts of the sea in the Persian Gulf which the Company wished to include in the area of their potential operations. They understood that his Majesty’s Government held that three miles was the limit of territorial waters, whereas the Persian Government claimed a belt of twelve miles. Along most of the Persian coast the width of sea which the Company wished to include in their concession was within the three mile limit. At the northern end of the Gulf, however, there were parts of the sea in the twelve mile belt wnich they wished to include. 3. Furthermore the chosen areas had to be precisely demarcated in order that the Persian Government might be able/- ■ -\353 able to check the measurements for themselves sbTTl“!ir8flCH“H5rrr that they did not exceed 100,000 square miles in all. This applied to the demarcation of such sections of the boundaries as followed the coast as well as to inland sections. As the existing maps of Southern Persia were inaccurate it was proposed to show these boundaries by fixing certain coordinates (whether on land or sea) and joining them together. Along most of the coast they would fix a number of straight lines just skirting the coast-line on the seaward side, with the object of allowing for uncertainties or future changes in that line and also of rendering mensuration easier. At Jask they would carry the boundary out for about three miles. It was only at the northern end, as had been said, that they wished to carry it out for as far as twelve miles. 4. The Company wished to know whether the submission by them to the Persian Government of plans showing that they had chosen for their concession areas extending beyond the three mile limit, approved as they would necessarily have been by the Board of Directors, of whom two were representatives of His Majesty* s Government, would conmit his Majesty* s Government to a recognition of the Persian claim to a territorial limit of twelve miles. In other words, would His Majesty* s Government object to the inclusion in the concession areas of waters outside the three mile limit? 5. Mr. Baggallay explained shortly the position as regards territorial waters. It was true that his Majesty’s Government, largely, he thought, for reasons connected with fisheries, held to the three mile limit. Most other countries accepted this view. Persia, however, claimed twelve miles, though he thought that she regarded this belt as divided into two fringes of six miles each and claimed rights falling short6994 i 1953 j of full sovereignty in the outer fringe. he would look up the Persian law on the subject and let the Company know exactly what it laid down. Other countries 'besides Persia, for instance Norway, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and he 'believed Portugal, also claimed more than three miles. 6. The position in international law was uncertain. Efforts to reach international agreement on the subject had so far come to nothing, and although other countries could not say that his Majesty’s Government were wrong in maintaining that tiie proper limit was three miles, his Majesty’s Government could not say that those countries were wrong in saying that the limit could and saould be increased. Thus, if the matter were referred to arbitration the case would probably go in favour of whoever happened to be the defendant. If, for instance, His Majesty’s Government took the Persian Government to court because they objected to some act of sovereignty done by the Persian Government or their agents in waters lying between three and twelve miles from the Persian coast, they would probably be told that they had failed to prove that the Persian Government had no right to do what they had done in those waters. If on the other hand, the Persian Government took his Majesty’s Government to court because of something done by, say, one of his Majesty’s Ships in such waters, they would probably be the ones to be told that they had failed to show that the warship had no right to do what it had done. It was conceivable that, as time went on, the mineral potentialities of the bed of the sea, as brought to light by the problem facing the present meeting, would prove to be more important than questions of fishing rights and make it desirable for his Majesty’s Government themselves to claim more extensive territorial limits. (Dr. Lees quoted a case/however, was mere speculation and for the moment His Majesty’s Government v/ere concerned to maintain as “best they could, notwithstanding the uncertain legal position he had described, the principle of the three mile limit. Nevertheless he thought that His Majesty’s Government would not wish, if they could possibly avoid it, to press the Company to forego the possibility of boring outside the three mile limit in conditions giving them a reasonable assurance of exclusive possession. He wondered whether, in order to make it as easy as possible for His Majesty’s Government to do so, it would not be possible to find some formula whereby the area delimited by the Company could be referred to in such terms as would not identify it too closely with either the three mile or the twelve mile limit. He also enquired whether it would not be possible to say simply that in certain places the boundaries bf the concession area or areas were ’’the limits of Persian territorial waters”. It was, after all, possible that before the Company’s concession expired in 1993 an international conference might fix territorial waters at six or ten or even twenty miles. Such a formula would guard the Company against all eventualities. In any case he would like to give the matter further consideration. 8. Mr. Mylies and his colleagues thought a suitable formula could be found and said that they also v/ould give it their thought. They did not, however, think that a mere mention of the ’’limits of territorial waters” would be sufficient, since the Persian Government would either regard it as too vague, or else claim that it meant that the whole of the twelve mile (or at least six mile) limit was included9 r 6 S 9 &lt;t &gt; ® 1? 1933 J ir lurv'r { !9o /Srn-a W in the concession areas- which might swallow' the 100,000 square miles. 9. They next asked how the Company should draw the boundary of their area at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, seeing that the frontier was delimited only as far as a point just below Pao on the left bank of the river. After Mr. Baggallay had given a short explanation of the position, as His Majesty's Government saw it, under the 1913 Protocol and the 1914 Proems Verbaux and of the various methods which had been advanced for defining international frontiers where they passed through territorial waters, (none of which had, however, universal international sanction), he said that so long as the Company choose a boundary which left the whole Hooka Channel outside their area he did not think (subject to the question of territorial waters already discussed) that His Majesty's Government would wish to raise any objection to their fixing one of their coordinates at the tip of Marakat Abadan and from there carrying their line out to sea more or less as a prolongation of the final section of the left bank of the river. The Company's representatives agreed to avoid the Hooka Channel completely. 10. Dr. Lees then asked what was the position as regards the High Seas. Would it be possible for the Company, if they wished to do so, to sink shafts in the High Seas, join them together with buoys and ropes and claim exclusive rights within the area thus enclosed? 11. Mr. Baggallay said that it was considered to be legally possible in certain circumstances to stake a claim to the bed of the sea as opposed to its surface. The pearl fishers in the Persian Gulf might be said to have acquired prescriptive rights to certain banks in the High Seas, and he/ 11 L [938 I he 'believed that some of the Cornish tin mines extendedr out to sea heyond the three mile limit and that His Majesty^ Government claimed that the tin deposits wnich lay under the sea outside the three mile limit could be and had been appropriated. But these v/ere both examples of rights acquired as the result of exclusive enjoyment and possession during a long period of time. The general theory was that the High Seas could not be appropriated by States or individuals and though he thought that there might be nothing to prevent the Company from boring anywhere they liked in the bed of the sea below the High Seas, so long as they did not thereby interfere with navigation or fisheries, it seemed to him very doubtful if they would be able to shut off a larger area than they needed for each shaft and claim exclusive rights within that area. In other words they would not be able to appropriate an entire oil formation below the High Seas or prevent anybody else from sinking shafts adjoining their own. If, on the other hand, nobody else did in fact v sink any shafts, they might in course of time acquire a prescriptive right to such a formation. 12. In conclusion, Mr. Mylles and his colleagues emphasised the fact that the question was far from being academic. Their researches pointed to the probability that | rl five or six large oil fields might lie somev/here in the region comprised by the flat country at the head of the Persian Gulf and the adjacent sea and in a few years it might be technically possible to tap the fields under the sea through even greater depths of water than at present. It was quite possible that in about ten years they might wish to start operations in parts of the sea-bed lying as far as twelve miles from the Persian Coast at the northern end of the Persian Gulf.

The Minister of the Interior submitted yesterday (June 24th, 1934) the following Bill to the Majliss for acceptance:- Law concerning the specification of the Limits of coastal waters tend a government zone of control in seas; passed on (Tir 24th 1913 (July 15th, 1934). To the honourable National Consultative Assembly: In order that the limits of frontier waters of the State, and of zones of control of the Government in the sea may be defined, and in order to avoid certain misunder standings, I now submit, and request the acceptance of, a bill containing eight articles which specifies the limits of frontier waters and of the control of the government in the seas of Persia. First Chapter : On territorial waters and zones of control: Article I . That portion of the sea which extends along the coast up to the distance of six nautical miles from the coasts of Persia, reckoned from the lowest tides, is accounted Persian territorial water, and in this zone whatever is situated below the bottom of the sea, on the surface of the sea, and above it, belongs to the State of Persia. Moreover, in regard to the execution of certain A BILL CONCERNING CONTROL OVLR FRONTIER WATERS : laws/{ ei (9) [ 1953 J laws and agreements relating to security, defence, national interests, or to the preservation of shipping routes, another Zone, which shall be named the Zone of Naval Control, and shall be such that the Imperial Government shall have the right of control therein, shall extend parallel to the coast to a distance of twelve nautical miles from the limit of the lowest tide. Remark : A nautical mile is equivalent to 1,852 metres. Article II : With regard to bays (or n little gulfs' 1 ) the boundary of territorial waters shallbegin from a straight line joining the outermost point of one side of the bay to the outermost point of the other side of the bay: and if the width of the mouth of the bay is more than ten nautical miles, the line of the territorial waters shall be situated at the nearest part of the union of the bay with the sea, that part being such that its breadth does not exceed ten nautical miles. With regard to ports, the limit of territorial waters will begin from a line lying between the permanent buildings of the port which are the furthest advanced in the direction of the sea. Article III . Every island which belongs to Persia shall have special territorial waters of its own, the limits of which will be determined in accordance with the arrangements laid down in Article l (the first portion). In regard to an archipelago the islands which compose it shall be regarded as a single island, and the distance of the territorial/territorial waters of the archipelago shall he reckoned from those islands which are furthest from the centre of the archipelago„ Second Chapter : The conditions of entry and anchorage of foreign war-ships in Persian waters, and the arrangements laid down for them: Article IV . Foreign war-ships and submarines, on condition that they travel on the surface of the water, have the __ right of innocent passage through the territorial waters of Persia, unless the above-mentioned ships belong to States which are at war, in v/hich case the national and international dispositions v/hich are laid down for times of war and for the safeguarding of neutrality will be put into force. The conditions of transit for war-ships, alluded to in the first portion of this Article, shall be defined in a special Regulation, particularly with regard to the fixation of the number of those shipso Article V : The conditions of anchorage of foreign war ships in Persian territorial waters shall also be determined in a special Regulation. The above-mentioned ships must observe, while in the waters alluded to in this Law, the Laws and Regulations of Persia 0 Article VI : The Government may, on grounds of national protection, or for other important causes, prohibit the transit or anchorage of foreign war-ships in certain ports or in portions of territorial waters. The above-mentioned ports/ports and portions will be named ’’Forbidden Zone^Jl 699 i- i \ 1 S38 Article VII : Foreign war-ships, on condition of reciprocity, will be exempt from customs inspection, and customs duties will be charged only on those goods which are imported from the above mentioned ships to the coast for consumption. The above-mentioned ships, on condition of reciprocity, will be exempt from port dues, tonnage dues* and similar imposts. Article VIII : The examination of misdemeanours ( .junheh ) and crimes ( .ian ayat) which may take place on foreign war ships are outside the jurisdiction of Persian courts. Sentences of capital punishment which may be pronounced by foreign courts must not be executed in Persian territorial waters or zones of control„ Prime Minister.

(4/5/J7) of th« 5th April regarding the arxeat by the Persian aftax being involYed in an affray with i’eraian oooliea on board that vessel while it waa lying at the outer anchorage at Buahire, and in which you requested instructions regarding the attitude which ilia iiajeaty's Government proposed to adopt in the event of a British subject being arrested by the Persian authorities in corresponding clrournstances* 2. After carefully weighing the various considerations put forward in your despatch under reference, I am of the opinion that for practical reasons it is desirable that Persian jurisdic tion should be recognised over the outer anchorage of the Persian port of Buahire, Owing to the shallowness of the harbour, this is a place where sea-going vessels perform the operations which they would normally perform inaid- a port, and in so far as foreign vessels go there for the nurpoae of establishing contact with the shore, and to that end admit Persian officials on board. they must be assumed to accept some measure of Persian jurisdiction* At the same time, it sterns desirable to find a way of meeting the practical needs of this situation which does not prejudice the posi tion which His iiujesty’s Government have taken up with regard to any recognition by His Majesty's Government of the Persian claim to a six-mile limit (or in exceptional circumstances twelve miles) or a contiguous zone* B* in these circumstances, I consider that the difficulty could best be met, if His Majesty's Government were to take the line that. I have had under consideration your despatch Ho* 1H6 authorities of a member of the crew of the German ^Geiefels' A’ the Halts of territorial waters and, in particular, does not imply H*J* Seymour isquire, J*ju*j. , J*V*C*, etc* , etc*, etc* , /in- 2 - in view of the special cixomaatanoea obtaining at Baahire, they intend # so fax aa they axe concerned, to regard the outer anchorage \ aa being under i'eraian Jurisdiction in the same manner as if the anchorage were part of the Bexaian port of ^ushife, and that ships feoing there will accordingly be deemed to be in the same position as if they were in Persian national waters, 'fhis method appears preferable to one involving any attempt to negotiate a special agreement with the Persian Government in regard to the outer anchorage at Bushire, more especially as that Government dearly could not be expected to accept a proposal for such an agreement, the conclusion of which would oe completely inconsistent with the attitude which they have always maintained regarding' the li; its of Persian territorial waters. 4. If this policy is to serve its purpose, it ought to be communicated officially to the Persian Government. The communica tion would be a statement of the view which His Majesty’s Govern ment had decided unilaterally to adopt with regard to this matter. and would contain a definition of what they conceived to be the geographical limits of the anc oxage.

'Geierfels' after being involved in an affray with Persian coolies on board that vessel while it was lying at the outer anchorage at Bushire, and in which you requested instructions regarding the attitude which His Majesty’s Government proposed to adopt in the event of a British subject being arrested by the Persian authorities in corresponding circumstances. 2. After carefully weighing the various considerations put forward in your despatch under reference, I am of the opinion that for practical reasons it is desirable that Persian jurisdiction should be recognised over the outer anchorage of the Persian port of Bushire. Owing to the shallowness of the harbour, this is a place where sea-going vessels perform the operations which they v/ould normally perform inside a port, and in so far as foreign vessels go there for the purpose of establishing contact with the shore, and to that end admit Persian officials on board, they must be assumed to accept some measure of Persian jui'j sdiction/ H.J. Seymour, Esq., C.M.G., C.V.O. etc•, etc., etc. HI 'S~r ^jurisdiction. At the same time, it seems desirable to find a way of meeting the practical needs of this situation which does not prejudice the position which His Majesty’s Government have taken up with regard to the limits of territorial v/aters and, in particular, does not imply any recognition by His Majesty’s Government of the Persian claim to a six-mile limit (or in exceptional circumstances twelve miles) or a contiguous zone. 3. In these circumstances, I consider that the difficulty could best be met, if His Majesty’s Government were to take the line that, in view of the special circumstances obtaining at Bushire, they intend, so far as they are concerned, to regard the outer anchorage as being under Persian jurisdiction in the same manner as if the anchorage were part of the Persian Port of Bushire, and that ships going there will accordingly be deemed to be in the same position as if they were in Persian national waters. This method appears preferable to one involving any attempt to negotiate a special agreement with the Persian Government in regard to the outer anchorage at Bushire, more especially as that Government clearly could not be expected to accept a proposal for such an agreement, the conclusion of which would be completely inconsistent with the attitude they have always maintained regarding the limits of Persian territorial waters. 4. If this policy is to serve its purpose, it ought to be communicated officially to the Persian Government. The communication would be a statement of the/the view which His Majesty’s Government had decided unilaterally to adopt with regard to this matter, and would contain a definition of what they conceived to he the geographical limits of the anchorage. I am advised that a simple definition which would he adequate for this purpose would he 'an area within one mile of ’’the charted position of the Outer Anchorage light huoy’’. I shall he glad if you will consider this suggestion, if necessary in consultation with the acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and furnish me with your opinion on it in due course. 5. A further point requiring consideration is that of the time at which the proposed communication which is to he addressed to the Persian Government should he made in order hest to serve the purpose in view. In general, I consider that little would he gained hy making this communication before the particular circumstances which would render it necessary have arisen, and it might he hest to wait until a concrete case of the kind contemplated in the last sentence of paragraph 2 of your despatch under reference has occurred. Nevertheless, I am prepared to leave it entirely to your discretion to decide on the time and manner of making such a communication, and you are authorised to take such action at any time when, in the light of local considerations, it may appear desirable.

'Geierfels” became involved in an affray with Persian coolies on board that vessel, while lying at the outer anchorage at Bushire, as a result of which the sailor, who submitted to Persian jurisdiction, was subsequently brought back to Bushire from Bandar Shahpur in a Persian warship for trial in the Bushire Courts. In view of the fact that the outer * anchorage at Bushire is outside the limits of territorial waters as recognised by His Majesty’s Government, Mr. Seymour asks for instructions in order to determine his attitude in the event of i a British subject being arrested by the Persian authorities in corresponding circumstances. 2.

Mr. Eden will he glad to learn in due course whether the Marquess of Zetland concurs in his views as set forth above• 7. A similar letter is being addressed to the Admiralty. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant,1 f •/ 5th April f 1937. Ho. 188 (4/5/37 ) i Q ^ Sir, I have the honour to inform you that at the end of 1936 a German member of the crew of the German Hansa line &amp;»S. ,, Geierfela rt became involved in an affray with Iranian coolies on board the vessel when she was lying at the outer anchorage at Buanlre. Two coolies subsequently prosecuted the German sailor for assault. He submitted to Iranian jurisdiction, and was brought back to Bushlre in an Iranian warship from Bandar Jhahpur. The case had not been finally settled when the '•oeierfela* sailed for Europe# and the sailor was left behind at Bushire. 2. The German Legation, when consulted by the agents of the Hansa Line at Bandar Shahpur and ISushire, decided that the sailor must be surrendered to the Iranian authorities. Through this submission to Iranian jurisdiction a precedent has now been created for the ex srcise of jurisdiction in respect of offences committed by foreigners on board foreign ships lying at the outer anchorage at Bushire, that is outside the limits of territorial waters as recognised by His Majesty’s Govern ment. The political Resident in the Persian Gulf has therefore requested Instructions regarding the action which he should take in the event of the Ii’anian authorities seeking to arrest and bring ashore from a ship at the outer anchorage any British subject or British protected person or subject of the Arab Sheikhdoms f who may be accused of an offence against Iranian Law. The Right Honourable Anthony Sden, M.C#, M.F., etc. $ etc., &lt; to•, The Foreign Office3* The state of affairs at the outer anchorage at Bushire is peculiar, and there can I think be few other examples of a port where cargo and passengers must be discharged at an anchorage outside the limits of what all states would recognise as territo#! rial waters. The fact that His Majesty's Government have made np protest against the exercise of the functions of Iranian quarantine, port, passport and customs officials on British iaips lying at the outer anchorage might perhaps be tacen aa a tacit recognition of the unusual situation at Bushire, and might make it difficult to base any protest at the arrest of a British sub ject at the outer anchorage on the grounds that it is outside territorial waters, and that Iranian officials can therefore have no jurisdiction there. Colonel Fowle has however suggested to me that the formal notification to the Iranian Government in 1934 of the refusal of His Majesty's Government to recognise the limits of territorial waters claimed by them, might be held to conetitute a technical protest against the exercise of particular functions ►, by Iranian officials outside the limits recognised by His Majesty'a Governrnent. 4. Kveu if this be so, it is clear tliat it is far from being i acceptrd in international law that states have no rights at all in the area immediately outside^territorial waters. Thus Oppenheim in section 190 (i) of Volume 1 says ... *• a customary fcule of the I^w of flattens may be said to exist which allows littoral states in the interest of their revenue and sanitary laws to impose certain duties on such foreign vessels bound for their ports as are approaching, although not yet within, their territorial maritime belt 1 *. This view is supported by Article 2 of the draft Convention quoted in paragraph 2 of bord Mont- eagle’s semi-official letter to Sir Robert Clive No. S 467/2/34 of the 31st January, 1929. It would therefore seem open to the Iranian Government, reserving their views aa to the proper limit of territorial waters, to claim that even ii they accepted the /limit- 5 - © no !e. limit of throe miles* they would still be entitled by this cus tomary rule of international law to exercise certain Jurisdiction at the outer anchorage at isushire* colonel Fowls has suggested of 'tttMf to me that while this customary rule A might Justify a limited ; Jurisdiction in revenue and sanitary matters* it would not Justify the exercise of criminal Jurisdiction, But in practice I think it would be extremely difficult to draw the line* and that Jurisdiction in revenue matters* such as smuggling would inevit ably merge into criminal Jurisdiction# If His Majesty's Government were to contest the right of the Iranian Government to exercise oven a limited Jurisdiction at the Outer Anchorage* they would seem logically driven to main tain that the anchorage is situated in the High 3eas* concerning which Oppenheira says in Section 146 of Volume 1 'as the High Seas are not under the ©way of any state* no state can exercise its Jurisdiction there* It would follow that Iranian officials going on board ships at the outer anchorage could have the status ^ only of visitors* but in all the circumstances it seems to me very difficult to maintain such a view# Further I observe from paragraphs 3 and 4 of Section ITf (d) of the confidential merao- t randum enclosed in Lord Monteaglc's letter under reference that in 1989 Hie Majesty's Government accepted the view that no tftute could be expected to tolerate with equanimity circumstances arising* under which* owing to peculiar local conditions* the absence of Jurisdiction over vessels on the High Seas immediately contiguous to its territorial waters might prejudice gravely the enforcement of the laws or the well-being of the community within its territory# They then took the view that where such circum stances arose* it was the duty of any Foreign state to come to an agreement enabling the state concerned to exercise such rights of control over the merchant vessels of the Foreign state con cluding the agreement as might be necessary# 6# In the above circumstances His Majesty's Government /maynay not wish any protest made against the arrest of a British Subject or protected person at the outer anchorage for an offence against Iranian law* In my opinion there is much to be said for the view that if a British subject commits an offence against Iranian law on board a vessel at the outer anchorage, no objection should be raised to his arrest by the Iranian authorities* It appears to me tiiat it is an invidious position for Hie Majesty’s Government to protect, or to attempt to protect, an offender against the consequences of hia offence on such grounds as arise in this case, and the difficulty is Increased by the recent adoption of the German Government of the contrary attitude* Colonel Fowle on the other hand inclines I think, to the view that, in order to safeguard the principle of the three mile limit and until an agreement i© concluded by His Majesty’s Government recognising the special position at Bualiire, a protest should be made at any arrest occurring in the circumstances contemplated* 7* If His Majesty’s Government hold that, to safeguard the above principle, a formal protest is necessary in a case such as that of the member of the crew of the i.S* Geierfels, it might perhaps be possible to temper a protest, which would other wise be somewhat ineffective and perhaps difficult to maintain in international law, with some phrase indicating that His Majesty’s Government are ready to negotiate a special agreement to cover the circuastances at Bushire* I realise, however, that Hi© Majesty’s Government might not think the conclusion of such an agreement worth while* nevertheless the poin&gt; raised by Colonel Fowl© is clearly of some importance, and I should there for© be grateful to receive in due course your instruction© regarding the action which he should take in the event of the /IranianIranian authorities ari’esting arty British v*ub3ect or^ protected person for any offence against Iranian law cosimitted at the Outer Anchorage at Bushire# 8* I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India Ho# 69 and to the Honourable the 3-olitieal Recident in the Persian Gulf Ho# 28# I have the honour to Toe with the highest respect, air.

Since it is not possible for a cruiser to anchor within three miles from the shore, owing to the shallow water off that oort, Lords consider that the Commander-in-Chief is nrobably unduly anprehensive of the Persians attaching any special significance to the firing of a salute outside the three mile limit, and that his intended explanations may only nut it into the minds of the Persian authorities to re-ooen the controvert about the width of territorial waters.

CONFIDENTIAL Extract from Report from the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf dated 21st October, 1934 No.230/529. 7 I expressed my view that the new Persian law claiming a six mile territorial limit and a further six mile zone of control was designed to facilitate anti- smuggling operations. The visits of Persian warships to funb and Bu Musa were probably inspired by the same cause, (though the Persian claim to them is an old one) as they believe - not without some reason - that these islands are used as smuggling bases. With a twelve mile zone, and control of the islands their operations, particularly in a sphere of considerable smuggling activity, would be greatly simplified. It would give them considerable scope for interfering with and detaining British and Arab dhows on the high seas if their claim were admitted.it T 10827/4148/380 * ^ 3 4 j FORF.IOfi OFPICS, S.t.l. 22nd October, 1934# Sir, With reference to your letter No. M* 4313/34, of the 2nd instant, relative to legislation recently enacted in Persia defining Persian territorial waters, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to inform you that the other departments whom he consulted have concurred in the terras of the proposed telegram to His Majesty^ Minister at Tehran, the draft of which was enclosed in the letter from this department No. T 9617/4148/380 of the 12th ultimo. 2.In Sir John Simon’s opinion, the question of bays would not appear to be of special importance so far as Persia is concerned, and he hopes that, in the circumstances, the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty also will see their way to concur in the proposed telegram. 3. I am to add that Sir Reginald Hoare will be instructed to make it clear to the Persian Government that this further communication is in continuation of his note of July 16th last and is not intended to supersede it. 4. Copies of Ihis letter have been sent to the India Office, Board of Trade, Ministry of Agriculture, Dominions Office, Colonial Office, and Scottish Office. The Secretary of the Admiralty I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, Sir (Signed) R. WARNER.0 112. J^^DHANDUM , Please see Mr. Cramtiie's note on p.Z.6186/34 telow. I have since discussed this question further with Mr. Baggallay. 2 . I said that I thought we should regard the point discussed in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the -admiralty letter as a matter essentially between them and the Foreign Office, upon on which we are not called/to express a view. 3. There seemed considerable advantage in action on the lines suggested in paragraph 3 of the Admiralty letter, and presumably the Foreign Office would see no difficulty about it. If the Foreign Office were prepared to accept the Admiralty suggestion it would then be unnecessary for us to make any comment on the Admiralty letter of 2nd October. Otherwise, higher authority here might perhaps be disposed to consider supporting them on this point. Mr. Baggallay explained that the papers were dealt with primarily in the Treaty Department, but promised to obtain them and to discuss the point raised in connection with paragraph 3 of Admiralty letter further in due course. Cc&gt; « Vb-.13b P. z. ! 5186 B. 4313/34 ) 2nd October, Sir, With reference to your letter of the 12th September, No, T,9617/4148/380, forwarding the draft of a proposed telegram to H*M, Minister at Tehran, concerning the legislation passed in Persia defining Persian territorial waters, I am commanded by My Lords Gommissioners of the admiralty to acquaint you, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign ^fairs that notwithstanding the views expressed by H.M, Grovernment in 1929 in the reply to the League of Nations questionnaire. They are of opinion that it is most undesirable to allow the Persian claim for a 10 mile rule for bays to be left unchallenged, more particularly as action is being taken by H,M, Government to enter a protest concerning other points in the legislation to which objection is seen. They would observe that the under taking given in 1929 was only to consider the question of a 10 mile rule and only if such a rule met with general acceptance, 2, Uj Lords therefore consider that instructions regarding Article II of the Bill should be included in the proposed telegram to Tehran on the lines of paragraph 4 of Foreign Office letter of the 3rd August, No, T,8364/4148/380, and that H,M, Minister at Tehran should be informed of the views held by H,M.Govemment upon the limits of territorial waters in bays in ease he is unaware of them, 3, My Lords also suggest that H,M, Minister should make it clear to the Persian Government that the new communication is in continuation of his Note of the 16th July and is not intended to supersede that note, 4, Copies of this letter have been sent to the India Office Board of Trade, Ministry of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries, Dominions Office, Colonial Office and Scottish Office, I am.

The Bill enclosed in the despatch from His Majesty f s Minister at Tehran No. 320 of the 13th June last having now been passed and awaiting the Royal Assent, it is necessary to consider wuat representations should be made to the Persian Government with regard to ius provisions. 3. With regard to Article I, the extent of territorial waters is fixed at 6 nautical miles for general purposes, but it may be extended to a distance of 12 nautical miles for certain special purposes. His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran was instructed on the 14th ultimo to inform the Persian Government on behalf of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Arab Rulers in the Persian Gulf that they are unable to recognise any claim to territorial waters outside the three mile limit. The Persian Government maintain in reply that the limits are fixed in accordance with national needs. Sir John Simon considers that, having made a protest on this point, further representations are not necessary. COPY SENT BY AIR MAIL of c ■ b ' 3 &lt;1 /y 4 The Under Secretary of State India Office. Cui'V SENT TO.4. With regard to Article II, the line of territorial waters in bays is fixed at 10 nautical miles. His Majesty*s Government have always held the view that, for general purposes, the line closing bays should be not more than 6 nautical miles, and it would seem necessary therefore, to inform the Persian Government that a 10 mile line cannot be accepted. 5. The provision with regard to ports in this Article does not appear to call for any comment. 6. Article III. Sir John Simon understands that the question of archipelagos is not of practical importance in the Persian Gulf, but he is of opinion that the view of His Majesty*s Government expressed in reply to the League questionnaire prior to the holding of the conference on the Codification of International Law in 1929, should be stated to the Persian Government. 7. It is stated in Article IV that foreign warships have the right of innocent passage through territorial waters unless they belong to states wnich are at war. Sir John Simon is of opinion that the Persian Government should be informed that rhe right of innocent passage exists also in the case of belligerent warships. 3 . Sir John Simon does not consider that the remaining Articles call for any representations. 9. I am to enquire whether Sir Samuel Hoare concurs in the above views and whether he has any observations of a general cnaracter to offer in regard to the Persian Law. 10.

Moreover, in regard to the execution of certain laws and agreements relating to security, defence, national interests, or to the preservation of shipping routes, another Zone, which shall be named the Zone of Naval Control, and shall be such that the Imperial Government shall have the right of control therein, shall extend parallel to the coast to a distance of twelve nautical miles from the limit of the lowest tide. RemarksRemarks A natucial mile is equivalent to 1,852 metres. Article II . With regard to bays (or ’little gulfs*) the boundary of territorial waters shall begin from a straight line joining the outermost point of one side of the bay to the outermost point of tne other side of the bay; and if the width of the mouth of the bay is more than ten nautical miles, the line of the territorial waters shall be situated at the nearest part of the uaion of the bay with the sea, that part being such that its breadth does not exceed ten nautical miles. With regard to ports, the limit of territorial waters will begin from a line lying between the permanent buildings of the port which are the furthest advanced in the direction of the sea. Article III : Every island which belongs to Persia snail have special territorial waters of its own, the limits of which will be determined in accordance with the arrangements laid down in Article I (the first portion). In regard to an ( These words archipelago (the islands)which compose it shall be regarded are omitted in the text but as a single island, and the distance of the territorial are inserted in order to make waters of the archipelago shall be reckoned from those sense.) islands *1 ich are furthest from the centre of the archipelago. Second Chapter : The conditions of entry and anchorage of foreign war-«hips in Persian waters, and the arrangements laid down for them: Article IV : Foreign war-ships and submarines, on condition that they travel on the surface of the water, have the right of innocent passage through the territorial waters of Persia, unless the above-mentioned ships belong to States ¥*iich are at war, in which case the national and international dispositionsdispositions which are laid down for tines of war anc for the safeguarding of neutrality will be put Into force.

My Lords are of opinion that the Persian Minister for Foreign .JTfairs, when he stated to Mr. Mallet that Persia claimed a ten mile limit for territorial waters, was taking into account an adjacent zone. ^s the claim was put forward so informally, and as Mr. Mallet took the opportunity to say that H.M. Grovernment would never admit it, there appears to be no necessity for any more formal repudiation. 3 . YJhile My Lords have no objection to Sir Reginald Hoare being informed of the position with regard to territorial waters, they would most strongly deprecate that the lolitical Resident in the Persian Gulf should take any action such as that suggested in paragraph 5 of your letter, as, in addition to its bad efiect on British prestige in the Gulf, it would limit the area in which H.M. Ships could search dhows and furthermore would inevitably become known and be interpreted as a tacit admission of the iersian claim to a six mile belt of territorial waters plus an adjacent zone. 4. I am to suggest that, in any communication which may be made to Sir Reginald Hoare, the desirability on grounds of nder Secretary of State, ‘ ^ FOKKIC® OFFICE,high policy of avoiding any action which might in any ?/ay compromise the views of H.M. Government on territorial waters should be stressed. If a treaty is concluded with lersia in the fairly near future, as is hoped, it is possible that more notice will be taken of British representations concerning incidents in which dhows are involved; and from the broad point of view it is of course better that the present unsatisfactory state of affairs should be accepted rather than that anything should be done which might involve an admission of the Persian claim. 5.

COPY SENT BY AIR MAIlr o f ^/'/W ^ COPY SENT TO I am directed 'by Secretary Sir John Simon to request you to inform Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare that he has had under consideration a statement contained in paragraph 7 of Mr. Mallet*s telegram No. ^265 of the 15th October, a copy of which is enclosed, to the effect that the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs recently claimed a ten-mile limit for Persian territorial waters. 2. As Sir Samuel Hoare is aware, there is no international agreement laying down the limit of territorial waters for all countries. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom claim three miles only, hut Persia is by no means alone in claiming more; indeed at the Conference for the Codification of International Law held at The Hague in 1930, while most of the important maritime states claimed no more than three miles, they were in a minority. At that Conference, it may be recalled, the Persian representative claimed a limit of six miles plus an adjacent zone, the breadth of which does not appear to have been specified. Although the Persian representative did not himself give any explanation of the purpose for which this adjacent zone was claimed by his Government, the majority of other States which put forward a similar claim on this occasion made it clear that they required the adjacent zone partly at least for purposes of customs control. 3 ./ The Under Secretary of State, India Office5 ./ 3. The ten-mile limit recently claimed hy the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs appears at first sight to he incompatible with the claim made in 1930 hy the Persian representative at the Conference, hut it may well he that Kazemi had in mind the adjacent zone when mentioning the higher figure. Whatever may he the precise extent of the Persian claim, it is evident that if it includes an adjacent zone it cannot he far short of the ten-mile limit. 4. In the absence of any international agreement, it is, in Sir John Simon’s view, impossible to base a refusal to accept the Persian Government’s claim to a ten-mile limit upon the international position. Nor would it appear desirable to base such a refusal upon the fact that the Persian claim at the 1930 Conference was not to a ten-mile limit, since to do so would go near to being an acceptance of the claim to a six-mile limit and an adjacent zone, which would be contrary to the general policy of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom on the suoject. In these circumstances, a it cannot be expected that the Persian Government will admit the justice of any complaints regarding interference with shipping by the Persian navy within ten miles of the Persian coast, in cases where it would be a sound defence that the action was taken within the limits of Persian territorial waters. It appears therefore to Sir John Simon that, while protests should in such cases continue to be made in order to safeguard the principle of a three- mile limit. His Majesty’s Government have no means of enforcing their view.5. Subject to the concurrence of Sir Samuel Hoare, Sir John Simon proposes to inform His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran of the position as set forth above for his guidance, and he suggests that it may be desirable that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf should take steps to warn the masters of vessels from the Arab States of the Persian Gulf in suitable terms of the practical effects of the PersianCopy (T 11624/11524/360) f&gt; 1 4 S ' • / * Froa PERSIA .

No.194. 24th April 1929. (E.2048/2/34). Sir, In your despatch No*37, of the 19th January, you enclosed a copy of a draft Persian law regarding territorial waters and requested an expression of my views thereon. 2. I have now consulted the departments of His Majesty^ Government concerned and am advised that there are certain points in the draft law to which His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom would be justified in taking exception. For purposes of clarity and convenience these may be divided into four categories as follows A. Cases where it is reasonably clear that the Persian Bill infringes established rules of international law. a B. Cases where the Persian Bill infringes what His Majesty's Government believe to be the correct rules of international law, which they will uphold at the proposed Codification Conference at Geneva. C. Cases where the Persian Bill is within the rights of the Persian Government, but where the enactment of the proposal is one to which His Majesty's Government might conceivably take objection on the ground that it discriminates unfairly against them, and where the enforcement of any such provision would not conduce to those friendly and harmonious relations which it is desired to establish in the Persian waters of the Gulf. D. Cases where changes in the wording of the provisions of the Persian Bill might with advantage be introduced to render its operation clear. Sir R.H.Clive, K.C.M.G., etc*, etc*, etc*, Tehran. Category A. 3. The only point coming under Category A. is that contined in paragraph 3 of Article 4 of the Bill, which lays down/2 . down that previous permission must he obtained through diplomatic channels for two or more warships of the same flag to pass in company through Persian territorial waters. This is, I am advised, a clear violation of international law. Category B. 4. The points coming under Category B. are points in which the true legal position is still controversial, and where it may be difficult to state that the views upheld by His Majesty’s Government are necessarily right. For example, in paragraph 2 of Article 1 of the draft Bill a claim is made on behalf of Persia to exercise a measure of control up to a distance of eight miles from the coast. His Majesty’s Government are strongly of opinion that any claim for jurisdiction outside the three miles limit over foreigners for defence purposes and the enforcement of Persian laws or any international conventions (e.g. neutrality), as apparently made in this paragraph, cannot be admitted,unless as a result of a special agreement. Their general attitude in regard to this point is as set forth in paragraph 3 of their reply, a copy of which is attached for convenience of reference, to the schedule of points drawn up by the Preparatory Committee for the First Codification Conference at Geneva. 5. A second point coming under Category B. is that involved in Article 2, which embodies the ten-mile bay rule of the North Sea Fisheries Convention. His Majesty’s Government do not admit this as a general rule applying to bays everywhere and for all purposes, but it is possible that they might reconsider their attitude if such a rule met with general acceptance at the forthcoming International Conference. Pending such reconsideration, the Persian Government/Government must be informed that this rule is not admitted. 6. Thirdly, the proposal in paragraph 2 of Article 3 to treat an archipelago as a single unit without regard to the distance between the individual islands is contrary to the principle maintained by His Majesty’s Government, in whose opinion each island should have its own ring of territorial waters. 7. Fourthly, the prohibition in Article 13 of exercises, in Article 16 of taking soundings, etc. or surveying, of submarines operating submerged, and of aircraft flying from carriers, and in paragraph 1 of Article 17 of the movement of armed forces in boats from warships in the supplementary zone, cannot be admitted. Category C. 8. The limitation in Article 12 of the duration of a visit of a warship to seventy-two hours comes into Category C. There is no doubt that such limitation is within Persia s rights, but it is unusual, and a protest must be based, not on legal grounds, but on the ground that it is unfriendly and specially directed against the British • position in the Persian Gulf, and notably at Henjam. An attempt to enforce any such a provision at that port would certainly not conduce to those friendly and harmonious relations which His Majesty’s Government desire to see established in the Gulf. 9. Another point which comes under Category C. is that contained in paragraph 3 of Article 17, which, although not definitdy exceeding Persia’s legal rights, is contrary to international usage, although several countries require special notification if it is desired to land large numbers, even if unarmed. This regulation, too, is chiefly objectionable in so far as it may affect the British position at Henjam. Category/Category D. 10. There remain those points in the draft bill where drafting amendments are desirable; for instance, in paragrefb 1 of Article 1 the three miles limit is measured 'la ligne de la plus basse maree'. His Majesty's Oovernment take the line of mean low water spring tides. The Persian criterion may be difficult to check, particularly in the case of the mud flats at and near the mouth of the Shatt-el- Arab. 11. Again in paragraph 1 of Article 4 it is perhaps not made sufficiently cle ar that the national regulations *ill be limited to those required to carry out the international obligations of neutrality. This is, however, a matter to which I do not attach great importance. 12. In connexion with the observations contained in paragraph 4 above, it may be observed that the Bill is y ambiguously drafted and its intentions as regards the supplementary zone are by no means clear. Article 6 lays down that the regulations prescribed for territorial waters and the supplementary zone shall be applicable to foreign * vessels in terri torial waters. This would seem to imply that none of these regulations should be applicable to foreign vessels in the supplementary zone. This, however, is not consistent with the regulations in part 2 (see, for example. Articles 13 and 17) many of which apply to foreign war vessels in the supplementary zone. If it is in fact the intention of the Persian (Government not to apply the regulations beyond the three-miles limit to foreign merchant vessels this should be made clear by adding 'but not in the supplementary zone' at the end of the first sentence of Article 6. 13. A further point to which the attention of the Persian/ — ■*Persian Government might be drawn unofficially is that the application of so many rules to the supplementary zone (i.e. up to an eight-mile limit), might possibly give the impression that Persia is in fact claiming an eight-miles belt of territorial waters. In view, however, of the fact that there is nothing in the provisions relating to the supplementary zone which indicates an intention on the part of the Persian Government to claim exclusive jurisdiction within an eight-miles limit, the point is not one which can be pressed officially and in writing, and I leave to your discretion the question whether any useful purpose would be served by mentioning the point informally to the Persian officials concerned. 14. The remaining rules do not appear unreasonable or contrary to international usage, though they have a general tendency to strictness, and it is unusual to make rules for visits of warships the subject of legislation, and thus difficult to amend. It may perhaps be considered that the application of these rules, even where they are in full accordance with international custom (as, for instance, the claim in Article 11 to close specified ports to warships), may possibly in some cases be unfriendly and cause inconvenience to His Majesty’s Ships. I consider, however, that it would be an error to address representations to the Persian Government, based on the assumption that the articles concerned will be applied in an unfriendly manner, or are inspired by any wish to cause inconvenience to His Majesty’s Ships. 15. In your telegram No.39, of the 31st January, you informed me that the Minister of Court had agreed not to submit the Bill to the Majlis at present, and possibly not at all, and I hope therefore that there will be no occasion for representations on the lines contemplated in the present despatch./^3 20o 6* As despatch. If, however, the Persian Government decide to proceed with it, you will he guided, in protesting against such a decision on their part, by the observations set forth in paragraphs 3 to 12 above.

I AM commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint ^you, for the information of the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs, that in the appendix attached to C.I.D. Paper No. P.G. 12 of the 27th September, 1928, Note by First Sea Lord,” reference is made in paragraph 15 to a certain element of doubt which exists in the minds of the Admiralty as to the exact alignment of the Perso- Iraq frontier at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab. My Lords are also uncertain what claims Persia may put forward in respect of the Hooka Channel and to what extent such claims might be resisted. 2. In view of the importance of maintaining free access to the Shatt-el-Arab at all times, my Lords would be glad to be favoured with the observations of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on these questions. 3. A chart cutting is enclosed herewith, which explains the remarks made in the note referred to in paragraph 1. I AM directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to acknowledge the receipt of your secret letter of the 10th December, regarding the alignment of the Perso-Iraq frontier at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab. 2. In reply, I am to request you to lay before the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty the accompanying copy of a memorandum on this subject, prepared by the second legal adviser to this department, and to suggest for their Lordships' consideration that the question should be re-examined in the light of Mr. Malkin's observations. 3. Copies of this correspondence are being sent to the Colonial Office and India Office, and the Secretary of State will be grateful if their Lordships will cause those Departments to be furnished with copies of the chart cutting enclosed in your letter under reply. THE point raised is both interesting and difficult, and I am afraid I shall have to explain my ideas at some length. Article 2 of the Treaty of Erzeruin (the article which assumes that the frontier runs down the Persian bank of the Shatt) gives Persian ships the right to navigate the-Shatt “ depuis I'endroit oil ce fleuve se jette dans la mer. The 1913 protocol says : “ De ce point la frontiere suit le eours du Chatt-el-Arab jusqu'a la mer, en laissant sous la souverainetd ottomane le fleuve.” It is plain that the frontier laid down by these instruments went down the river to the point where it ceased to be a river and fell into the sea, or, to use the language which we should employ nowadays, to the point where national waters ceased and territorial waters began. It was this frontier and nothing beyond it which the Delimitation Commission set up under the protocol, was to trace “ sur les lieux,” and consequently their mission ceased at the point where the frontier terminated at the mouth of the river. a I am, &amp;c.

Memorandum by Mr. Malkin respecting the Perso-lraqi Frontier at the Mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab.mmm 3 [I J 45 can form the base line for territorial waters. According to the reply which has just been drawn up by the Departments concerned to the League of Nations questionnaire about territorial waters, “the base line is the line of mean low water spring tides.” I take this to mean that the land above this line must all be above water at low spring tides, and, if so, the areas in question would not seem to fall within the definition. It is to be noted, further, that the drying patches in these areas Ho not fall within the definition of islands in the same memorandum, because they are not “ in normal circumstances permanently above high water,” and could not, therefore, support, as islands, a base line. I should imagine that what happened was that when the commission arrived on the spot the whole of these areas were under water, and that they accordingly regarded the coast as being what is marked on the Admiralty chart by the thick green and red shading, the mouth of the river as lying at tlmt point, and everything beyond as being the sea. This is the only view which is, in my opinion, reconcilable with what they in fact did, and it is con firmed by the fact that on their map the Persian coast obviously corresponds to the green shading, and Maraket Abadan does not appear at all: its site is covered bv the words “ Persian Gulf.” If the Admiralty on reconsideration were to think this a view which we could uphold, our difficulties would largely vanish. If the base line of Persian territorial waters is taken from the thick green shading, the whole of the Rooka Channel would lie in the open sea. I he Western Channel might be partly in Persian territorial waters until it entered Iraq national waters, but there would, of course, be the right of innocent passage, and it would seem more likely that the limit between Iraq and Persian territorial waters would be regarded as running down the middle of it. A possible modification of this view might be that the base line for Persian territorial waters is to run not from the thick green shading, but from a line somewhere in the vicinity of “North Mast ” (since the area north-west of that may have stronger claims to count as land), but even in that case nearly the whole of the Rooka Channel would still be in the open sea and the rest in Persian territorial, not national, waters. I think that the above represents the most defensible line for us to take, and I suggest that the Admiralty should be asked to reconsider the question in the light of the above observations.

Mr. Amery would be glad to be furnished as soon as possible with any observations that Sir Austen Chamberlain may have to offer in regard to the points raised in Sir H. Dobbs’s despatch. 3. A copy of a letter which Mr. Amery has caused to be addressed to the Admiralty is enclosed herewith, for Sir Austen Chamberlain's information, and copies of this letter are being forwarded to the India Office, Air Ministry and Board of Trade. I am, &amp;c. T. T. K. LLOYD. [ 20167 ] N14G Enclosure 5 in No. 135. {Confidential.) Sir. Sir H. Dobbs to Mr. Amery. Bagdad, January 26, 192ff. n i ^ t ^ le honour to invite your attention to des})atch No. 37 dated the 19th January, 1929, from His Majesty's Minister at Tehran to the Foreign Office, giving cover to a copy of a draft Bill on the subject of Persian territorial waters. 2 It appears fo me that the last half of the first article of that Bill, which provides for a supplementary zone extending beyond the usual 3-mile limit to a limit of* 8 nautical miles from the coast, within which police rights will be exercised, may give rise to a conflict between the Persian and Iraq authorities in respect of the channel through the Shatt-el-Arab bar. The channel through the outer bai unusually known as the Hooka Channel, extends in an east-south-easterly direction from latitude 29° 5T 5' north, longitude 48° 40' 3' east, to latitude 29° 52' 6' north' longitude 48° 44' 3' east. The whole of the channel, therefore, though lying more than 3 nautical miles from both the Iraq and Persian coasts, lies within 8 nautical miles from the nearest point on the Persian coast. Subject, therefore, to the observations in the immediately following paragraph, I presume that the Persian (jovernment will be able, if this Bill becomes law, to claim the right to exercise police supervision for the purposes specified in the law over ships passing through this channel, including the British-India mail steamers. It is obviously impossible that such supervision should be permitted, and I hope that His Majesty’s Government will give due weight to this point when considering the other objections to this Bill which may exist, but with which I am not concerned. 3. I presume that if, despite any objections that may be raised by His Majesty’s Government, the Bill does eventually become law, it will be impossible to maintain that the Hooka Channel lies outside the 8-mile limit. There is, however, one point to be considered in this connexion. I am not aware of the international principles governing the prolongation into the sea of a land frontier, but I presume that it is the practice lor the line dividing the territorial waters of two adjacent countries, either to be an extension of the general direction of the adjacent portion of the land frontier between the two countries, or to be at right angles to the general direction of the coast line. A line drawn on the former principle could be drawn so as to exclude the Hooka Channel from the Persian supplementary zone. A line drawn on the latter pi inciple, however, would not so exclude it. I do not in any case consider that it would be safe to allow the Bill to pass unchallenged, and to trust to the subsequent exclusion from its scope of the Hooka Channel. 4.. In the same connexion, I wish to call your attention to an incident which oc cm red recently m the Hooka ( hannel and which is not unlikely to be repeated I enclose, for your information, a copy of a despatch which I sent to His Majestv’s Minister at Tehran complaining of the conduct of the Persian Government steam yacht “ Ivy in the Hooka Channel. It seems to me possible that the Persian Government, without at the moment definitely asserting any right of their own in regard to the channel, may reply by challenging the right of the Iraq Government to exeicise any control over the channel, which undoubtedly lies through its whole length outside Iiaq territorial waters, the westerly end of the channel being about 7 nautical miles from the nearest point of Iraq, t should be grateful if you would take into early consideration the question of the right, according to international law, of the Tiaq Government to control navigation passing through a channel which has been dredged by the Iraq Government in the open sea. If such a right is not already established, in view of the fact that the channel is a necessary approach to a navigable waterway ot international concern wdiich is under their control, it seems to me possible that the Iraq Government could take steps to regularise the position by legislation. I presume, however, that such legislation would be liable to be challenged immediately by the Persian Government. I should be glad if I could receive an early intimation ol your opinion upon these points, which appear likely to assume considerable importance in the near future. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majestv’s Minister at Tehran and to the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. H. DOBBS, High Commissioner for Iraq.

Sir H. Dobbs to Sir R. Clire. Sir, Bagdad, January 12, 1929. I H AVE the honour to inform you that on the night of the 9th November, 1928, the Persian Government steam yacht “ Ivy ” passed out of the Shatt-el-Arab through the Hooka Channel. She is reported to have ignored all signals and to have taken no notice of the channel regulations, thereby causing considerable danger to herself and to other vessels in the channel at the time. 2. The channel referred to is the new channel which has been dredged by the Iraq Port Directorate through the Shatt-el-Arab bar, and dredging is still in progress. I should be grateful if you would call the attention of the Persian Government to this incident, and suggest to them, in their own interests, and their vessels should make a practice of conforming to the regulations for navigating the Shatt-el-Arab and its approaches. The Basra port authorities will provide any information which the Persian authorities may require. I have, &amp;c. H. DOBBS, High Commissioner for Iraq. [E 1048/58/34] Enclosure 7 in No. 135. Admiralty to Foreign Office. (Confidential.) Sir, Admiralty, February 25, 1929. I AM commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to refer to your letter of the 28th December, 1928, relative to the Perso-Iraq frontier at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, and to put forward the following observations for the consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. 2. Since the Admiralty letter of the 10th December was written, and the chart cutting which formed the enclosure to that letter prepared, the original signed map showing the boundary line as fixed by the Delimitation Commission appointed under the 1913 protocol, and also the minutes of the meetings of the commission, have been borrowed from your Department and the question given further consideration. 3. The above-mentioned chart cutting was prepared from the map stitched up with the 1913 protocol, which had previously been borrowed from the Colonial Office, and wrongly assumed to show the boundary as finally settled. It appears evident that the boundary line was only roughly drawn on this map to illustrate the text of the protocol, and that no importance is to be attached to the continuation of the line seaward from the southern termination on the Persian bank. 4. The minutes of the commission and the original map shows that the commission fixed the starting-point of their work at a point on the bank 2 miles below a fort (shown on the map and also on the Admiralty chart) on the Persian side opposite, but a little below, Fao. There is also drawn on the map in a south-easterly direction from this point a line in yellow (the frontier line is shown in red) which does not appear to be explained in the minutes. It is suggested that it was put in to show what appeared to the commissioners, when they proceeded down the rive*' (possibly at high water), to represent the coast line, they having found the map in this respect incorrect. Otherwise it is difficult to understand why they commenced the frontier line where they did. 5. It appears evident from the text of the protocol that the commission’s map must be accepted as authoritative, as article 5 states that as soon as a part of the frontier shall have been settled, that part shall be considered as fixed definitely and shall not be liable to subsequent examination nor revision. Article 4 also says that in case of any disagreement amongst the four commissions (Russian, British, Turkish and Persian), the Russian and British Commissioners are to meet privately and their decision is to be recognised as binding on all four Governments. 6. My Lords would suggest, however, that it might be possible to maintain, if this is thought expedient, that the commission had made a mistake in starting where they did and that it is obvious that the river does not commence at that point but much further seaward, and that the line should be extended along the Persian shore [201671 2 a148 m accorctanee with the text of the protocol. In view of the possibility of the Abadan and Abdullah banks becoming obviously territory in the future, there would be obvious advantages in such an understanding being arrived at. /• Alter further consideration of the information available, my Lords are of opinion that the Abadan and Abdullah banks cannot at present be regarded as territory. This view is also supported by a paragraph in the protocol, which states as lollows - Turkish jurisdiction shall not be extended over portions of the Persian coast which may be temporarily covered by the tide (‘ couvertes d’eau par la maree ) or through other accidental causes. Persian jurisdiction shall not be exercised over territory which may be temporarily or accidentally uncovered by the normal level of low water being exceeded.” i Admiralty bailing Directions state that Marakat Abadan has from 1 foot to 1 fathom of water on it, but patches on its north-western part dry occasionally, and that Marakat Abdullah dries in patches at extraordinary spring tides. , ^ ^ agreed that the Abadan and Abdullah banks are not territory and that the frontier ends at the point fixed by the commission, the position would still be liable to lead to disputes. Persia might argue that Turkish (now Iraq) national vvaters ended at a line drawn irom the point fixed by the commission at right angles to the general course of the river, and that the angle formed by this line with the general line of the Persian coast below this point should be bisected in order to show where the two territorial belts met. This would apparently give Persia jurisdiction over the whole of the channel outside the river mouth. This might be opposed by arguing that in spite of the fact that the Marakat and Abdullah banks are not territory, there is no doubt that the river extends to their extreme points and that in accordance with the text of the protocol, and also in accordance with general principles of international law based on practical necessities, the whole of the river comes under Iraq. 9. Another argument that it might be useful to fall back on is that the line marking the termination of Iraq national waters should be drawn from the point hxed by the commission to South Mast, as the point to which the river bank extends on the western side. A line bisecting the angle that such a line makes with the General lineof the f ersian coast would apparently give Iraq a portion of the channel' e ■ - j- . n0t ‘ ier P 01 ’ 1 *' interest cleared up by this original map is the question ot jurisdiction over the waters immediately in front of Abadan. In Foreign Office letter of the 6th December, 1920, to India Office, it is stated that the original map gave Persia a strip of water facing Abadan which, it is remarked, ^no doubt constituted the anchorage of that port, in the same way as is done off Mohammerah (m accordance with the text of the protocol). The letter goes on to say that it is clear that these two anchorages he outside the jurisdiction of the Mesopotamian authorities. It appears evident, however, from the original map that this is incorrect. The frontier line follows the bank closely at Abadan itself and onlv o-oes into the river lower down to enclose the four islands between Chetait and Maaouive in accordance with the text of the protocol. ' ’ H. A copy of this letter, together with a photostat copy (not on the same scale! ot the portion of the original map covering the mouth of the river, and a copy of the chart cutting forwarded to the Foreign Office with Admiraltv letter of the 10th December, have been forwarded to Colonial Office and India Office. I am, &amp;c. CHARLES WALKER. ■ E 1183/2/34] Enclosure 8 in No. 135. _ n , Admiralty to Foreign Office. (Confidential.) ’ A dmirnltu Mnrrh ft 1 Q9Q ti ! 1 A A 0m, r' 1 : led by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to acquaint you that they have had under consideration letter dated the 21st February, 1929, from the ( oloma Office, letter dated the 28th February from the Foreign Office, together %'!' the telegram No. 63 from the High Commissioner of Iraq to the Secretary ot State tor the C olonies contained in Colonial Office letter No. 68007/29 in connexion with the Persian draft Rill regarding territorial waters.2. My lx)rds concur with the view of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in the letter of the 28th February above mentioned, that His Majesty’s Glovernment would have difficulty in refusing to consider a special agreement with the Persian Government, granting the Persian Government some rights of administrative control tor specific purposes beyond the 3-mile limit, provided that Persia can show that special local circumstances require such control. 3. the examination of the draft Territorial Waters Bill has not yet been completed, but it is observed that the Bill is ambiguously drafted, and its intentions as regards the supplementary zone are by no means clear. Article 6 lays down that the regulations prescribed for territorial waters and the supplementary zone shall be applicable to foreign vessels in territorial waters. This would seem to imply that none of these regulations should be applicable to foreign vessels in the supplementary zonA This, however, is not consistent with the regulations in Part II (see, for example, articles 13 and 17), many of which apply to foreign war vessels in the supplementary zone, and it is observed that Sir R. Clive has obviously read the Bill as applying generally to foreign vessels in the supplementary zone. 4. My fiords concur with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in his remarks as to the undesirability of Persia being given the right to search Arab shipping outside the 3-mile limit. 5. In connexion with the slavery question also, unless His Majesty’s ships are to be allowed to retain the right to search in F*ersian waters, this supplementary zone might result in a still further limitation of the right of search. 6. The aspect of the proposal which my Lords consider most dangerous is the question of the Shatt-el-Arab. The Rooka Channel is at present indispensable to the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab by heavy vessels, and as it is outside the ordinary 3-mile limit, its control by Iraq is liable to be challenged by Persia, who may claim control over it as within their 8-mile supplementary zone. Moreover, as stated in Admiralty letter of the 25th February (sent to Foreign Office, Colonial Office and India Office), there would appear to be no definite rule as regards drawing the boundary between the territorial waters of two adjacent countries in cases like those of Iraq and Persia, so that the question of the control of the river estuary inside the Rooka Channel is liable to give rise to dispute. 7. The navigation of the river channel is intricate, and only the rigid enforce ment of the local rules of navigation will prevent frequent accidents. It is therefore essential to resist any measure by which the Persians may claim to exercise police supervision over the estuary, including the Rooka Channel. 8. As remarked above by the High Commissioner in his telegram of the 18th February, the difficulties in respect of the Rooka Channel form a strong argument for reaching an agreement with Persia regarding the control of the Shatt-el-Arab and its approaches. 9. A copy of this letter has been sent to the Colonial Office. India Office, Air Ministry and Board of Trade. I am, &amp;c. i i E 962/58/34 j Enclosure 9 in No. 13.5. Foreign Office to Colonial Office. Sir, Foreign Office, March 14, 1929. I AM directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st February, forwarding for any observations which he might have to offer the copy of a despatch from the High Commissioner for Iraq regarding the situation as between Iraq and Persia at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab. 2. Mr. Secretary Amery will have observed from correspondence ending with Admiralty letters of the 25th February and the 6th March, that the boundary line at the mouth of that river has already been the subject of detailed examination in this department and the Admiralty. This correspondence, which has no doubt already been forwarded to the High Commissioner, will have shown him that, even apart from any fresh complication which might possibly be introduced by the passage of a Persian Territorial Waters Bill claiming a right to exercise police supervision in a zone extendino- to a limit of 8 nautical miles from the Persian coast, the situation is one of no littfe complexity and might well give rise to serious difficulties between Iraq and Persia.150 on tha • f W1 ^ seen ,rom paragraph 7 of their letter of the 25th February that, a™* of ln . ormatlon at present available, the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty ac fpr . ,( ? )im0n r.c ^ ^ Abadan and Abdullah banks cannot at present be regarded tt- tot 1 OI ^’ , ^is view is correct, the Rooka Channel lies in the open sea; and as p i • a ;!^f ^ . s ^ J( ^ v ernment have never admitted and have always objected to the tho ? OIC1 S n States to exercise rights of jurisdiction or control over the waters of rpfn kV Se j S ? utsi ^ e ^^e 3-mile limit of their territorial waters, they could logically p„ r . • ° r , mit a ^ ersian claim to exercise jurisdiction over this channel. But the thp S a if may not share this view, and if they were able to establish that rpfnfo if 1 iL u S ter / ltor y’ their claim would probably be much more difficult to a U would ’ ^^refore, seem useful if the High Commissioner could arrange for avniH SUrVey i? be unostei ?tatiously carried out, every precaution being taken to avoid arousmg 1 ersian suspicions, and the actual situation of the Persian and Iraqi Dossihimv nf T; Water T 1U i tides t0 be P recisel y ascertained, with a view to the onfn n nf u f ^ * Persian c aim ’ takin g ia to account the fact that, in the opinion of H is Majesty s Government, the base line for the determination of the limit issssaz* ° ! “ •f™* howe 7f r ' ' l can be abundantly estal)li s hed that the Abadan and thlrT o kS a / e k tenltor y- the position would still be liable to lead to disputes, as there seems to be no universally recognised principle of international law governing the lateral limitation of the territorial waters at the mouth of a river between the two riparian States. Persia might, therefore, claim jurisdiction over at A nt P l lrt t of the navigable channel between the Rooka Channel and the river mouth Although it might be possible to resist such a claim on the lines suggested in paragraph 8 of the Admiralty letter of the 25th February, and although even if a part of the channe were in Persian territorial waters, there would still be a right of innocent passage along it it is clearly desirable in the interests of Iraq to avoid the possibility ot disputes of this nature by agreeing to the adoption of some such scheme 7H, if advocated m the two memoranda enclosed in the Foreign Office letter of the 7th Maich. By placing the whole waterway of the Shatt-el-Arab, includino- [raoi and Fers,an territorial waters and (so far as concerns ships of the contracting St Ues) he Rooka Channel, under the control of the proposed conservancy board, on winch I ersia is to he adequately represented, such inducements to Persia as may at present exist to raise contentious issues of this nature will be removed. Sir Au-den Chamberlain agrees entirely with the view of the High Commissioner that the uncertainty of the present situation at the mouth of the Viver is an argument which should prove of primary importance for persuading the Iraqi Government of the necessity for a general settlement with Persia on the lines now under consideration t 5 1 *i. al S t0 i ad ;' that any r ;T! ^ Iraq, whether based on legislation or not to control the Rooka Channel would be inconsistent with the views of His Maiestv’s Government in the United Kingdom, as stated in paragraphs III (c) and wTof thelr memorandum sent last December to the League of Nations in reply to the “ Schedu I '' b&gt; o2M£ Ministry thj BoarJ of Tr*.T'Smin?on, 0«5 3 the Mk of a despatch to Sir R.

Sir, Tehran, Februai'y 1, 1929. THE recent incidents in the Persian Gulf, where without previous notice the local Persian officials attempted to subject His Majesty’s ships to unreasonable quarantine restrictions, may well have given the impression that the Minister of Court was deliberately indulging in a policy of pin-pricks and that the Persian authorities, in a childish and provocative way, were at his instigation showing how they could assert their sovereign rights at the expense of His Majesty’s navy. [20167] k114 'The Minister of Court stoutly denies this. His thesis is that there is room in the Persian Gulf for Great Britain and Persia, and that Persia has too long waived in the Gulf rights which undoubtedly belong to her. Amongst these are the control of her territorial waters and of the quarantine service. He is ready to admit that inexperienced quarantine officers may have shown an exces de zele, but not that they have been deliberately provocative. He equally refuses to admit that because His Majesty’s ships have not in the past been required to obtain pratique they should in the future be exempted from all quarantine regulations. There was no divine law, he said, to prevent a microbe being carried on a warship. On the other hand, he professes his readiness to make an arrangement about Henjam on the basis of some modification of the quarantine rules which may be considered necessary in ports like Bushire and Bunder Abbas. Meanwhile his Highness has promised to enquire immediately into the recent complaints which 1 embodied in a memorandum I gave to him on the 30th January and of which a copy is enclosed, and to give orders that excessive zeal should give place to reason and that untoward incidents should be avoided. As his Highness has expressed his readiness to conclude an agreement about Henjam as soon as possible and as I am expecting the Resident at Bushire and the senior naval officer in the Gulf to be here in ten days’ time, I propose to await their arrival before reverting to the matter provided there is no further trouble, unless lam in a position before then to submit to his Highness a draft agreement as proposed in my telegram No. 40 of to-day. 3. Bound up with this question of Henjam and quarantine restrictions as affecting His Majesty’s ships in the Gulf is the question of Persian territorial waters and the Bill on the subject which Taimourtache had had drafted and of which a copy was forwarded to you in my despatch No. 37 of the 19th January. As reported in my telegram No. 39 of the 31st January, I handed to his Highness a memorandum expressing my personal view that this Bill was unnecessary. 1 enclose a copy of this memorandum. From our subsequent conversation it 'was clear to me, firstly, that his Highness had made some study of the question, as he was aware of all the exceptions claimed to the 3-mile limit cited in your telegram No. 32 of the 29th January, and, secondly, that the Bill was to some extent in the nature of a threat. In fact, he did not discard the possibility of dropping it altogether if we came to terms on Gulf matters. At the same time he spoke of the arrangement agreed to last April, but never accepted in writing, in regard to the visits of His Majesty’s ships to Persian ports as a modus vivendi, and there is little doubt that, even if he is prepared to make any special arrangement at all on the subject apart from Henjam, he will insist on some modification of the existing practice. 4. It has occurred to me that the sudden enforcement of quarantine regulations against His Majesty’s ships, although admittedly within the rights of the Persian Government, may not be unconnected with the exclusion from Bahrein of Persians who are not provided with a British consular visa. 1 hesitate therefore to labour the status quo argument beyond a certain point, as I am convinced that Taimourtache will retaliate by reference to Bahrein. 5. Copies of this despatch, with its enclosures, are being sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Iraq. I have, &amp;c. R. H. CLIVE.

The text of tiled raft Persian Bill regarding territorial waters, and the Foreign Office letter of 13th February to the Admiralty, inviting their observations on the pointsraLsed hy that Bill '•in all its aspects' 1 , are flagged on P.1368/29 below. The questions raised in the present letter are:- (a) the possibility of a special arrangement with the Persian Government under which Persia should be enabled to exercise administrative control up to eight miles from the coast; (b) the possibility of giving a guarantee that Tamb and Abu Musa shall not become depots for smuggling. 2. The suggestion made on the first of these points in paragraphs 2-4 of the Foreign Office letter is sub star tially based on the fact that we have to a certain extent committed ourselves in the reply sent by H.M.G. to the i-eague of Nations questionnaire extent to which we are in fact committed for the purpose of the present discussion is examined in the following paragraph. But it is relevant that thereply in question was (it is understood)sent with other material for the consideration of a snail Committee of four or five members set up to examine the general question of territorial v&amp;ers and that that Committee met last month and issued an interim report indicating that it seemed possible that a common basis for agreement could be found, and stating that it hoped to meet again in April or May, by vtfiich time replies from other Governments mi$it have been received. The interim report did not, it is understood, enter into *copy flagged C regarding territorial waters.* The question of the below.- 2 - detail, and in Mr. Croft*s view it is unlikely, though not impossible, that the full text of the British reply will, if circulated at all, he circulated in the immediate future, so far as the Persian negotiations are concerned, if its circulation was delayed until the summer - as seems probable - we should be uncommitted by it on the present question and its reactions could be neglected. 3. This apart, it is for consideration how far we are actually committed in the present connection by the wording of the s ections of the memorandum quoted tyy the Foreign Office. The wording of those sections is, it is true, very general; the type of situation which they contemplate is not very clear (though it is presumably that created in America by liquor smuggling!); and the Persians might no doubt base on them an argument of the type suggested by the Foreign Office. I venture to suggest, however, that the nature and basis of Persian contraband difficulties in the Gulf would hardly justify an appeal for a special arrangement under the terns of the sections in question. It is a matter of common knowledge that the seriousness of those difficulties on the Persian side of the Gulf is the result first of the absence of effective control on land, coupled with the corruption of the local officials, and secondly of the inefficiency of the Persian Preventive Service. I submit that these can hardly reasonably be adduced as a basis for the grant by H.M.G. of a wholly special concession of a type which, as a general rule, they are most reluctant to grant except under the strongest pressure, and I suggest that we may take this line in replying to the Foreign Office. I understand d.o. that the Admiralty though a final decision has not been taken, feel strongly departmentally the undesirability of an eight- mile/Department. mile limit, and the objections to it referred to in paragraph 4 of the Foreign Office letter now under consideration are, of course, patent. I suggest therefore that we might take the objections set out above in replying to the Foreign Office, and propose that they should be put to Sir R. Clive with instructions not himself to raise the question, and, if it is raised by the Persian Government, to confine himself to reporting it home for instructions. 4. The second of the points referred to in p&amp;ra.l above has already been the subject of some consideratior on the main Persian negotiations file. The Department on that paper noted that it might be worth considering the possibility of giving a guarantee that Tamb and Abu Musa should not be used for smuggling purposes. This might, of course, mean the putting of a little pressure on the Sheikh of Shargah, though in fact we have no reason to believe that either island is to any extent used by smugglers. Sir Arthur Hirtzel noted that he agreed that action on these lines might be worth considering if the Persians displayed good will in the general negotiations, but that it should not be volunteered, and this view was accepted by the Secretary of State. The proposals on the subject made in para.5 of the Foreign Office letter do not commit us very far; it is a reasonable request from one friendly t overnment to another that mild pressure should be xercised on individuals suspected of consistent endeavours to infringe the laws of the other High Contracting Party, and I submit that with the Reservation that our good offices should not be offered by/4 . by Sir Robert Clive until later in the negotiations, when he may he able to turn it to some bargaining account, we might concur in the Foreign Office proposal. (Sd.) J.G. LAITHWAITE. 4.3.29.P. 1849. INDIA OFFICE, IMMEDIATE. WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 8th March 1929. Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of Foreign Office letter of the 28th February, No.E.953/2/34, examining the questions of giving Persia a special right of search outside the three-mile limit, and of endeavouring to assist the Persian Government in their contraband difficulties by a guarantee that the islands of Tarab and Abu Musa shall not become depots for smuggling. 2. As regards the first of these questions, Viscount Peel directs me to say that both on general grounds and because of its reactions on Trucial shipping, he would, as at present advised, be disposed to see strong objection to the conclusion of any special agreement with the Persian Government which would grant them a special right of search outside the three-mile limit. Nor does it appear to him that the passages referred to by Sir Robert Clive in the reply sent to the League of Nations questionnaire on territorial waters would necessarily render it impossible or even difficult, for His Majesty's Government to reject a claim for such an arrangement, were it put forward by the Persian Government. His Lordship presumes that it is improbable that the reply sent by His Majesty's Government to the League of Nations questionnaire will be circulated in the near future; but in any case he would suggest that Persia can hardly be regarded as entitled to plead 'peculiar local circumstances' imposing a duty on foreign states within the sense of the sections quoted in paragraph 2 of the The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W.l. Foreign/(0) ZW Foreign Office letter under reply until she has taken more effective steps to remedy conditions within her territorial waters and on her soil that prejudice the enforcement of the Persian laws against smuggling - in particular the inefficiency, or possibly corruption, of the Customs preventive service and the local Persian authorities. The metter therefore does not appear to be in pari materia with the American liquor-smuggling situation, and it would seem that His Majesty’s Government would have little difficulty in rebutting any argument based on that analogy which might be put forward by the Persian Government. In these circumstances, the Secretary of State would suggest that Sir Robert Clive should be advised of the objections to the conclusion of any special agreement granting a right of search outside the three-mile limit. On this understanding he agrees that, as suggested in para.4 of your letter, Sir R.Clive should be instructed not himself to raise the subject, and, if it is raised by the Persian Government, to abstain from committing himself, and to state that he will refer the matter home for observations. 3. As regards the suggestion made by Sir Rebert Clive that His Majesty’s Government might guarantee that the islands of Tamb and Abu Musa will not become depots for smuggling, the Secretary of State is in general agreement with the views expressed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in consider that the matter is one in which, at any rate at the present stage, His Majesty’s Government are called on to consideration of Sir Austen Chamberlain, that the Minister should be placed in possession of the views of His Majesty’s Government on the subject, but should be instructed to make no negotiations have proceeded further, he might then be a paragraph 5 of your letter under reply. He does not, however* volunteer any proposal. He would suggest, therefore, for the statement regarding it to the Persian Government* When the authorised,/2 If 3. authorised , if their general trend justifies action on these lines, to make use of an offer of the assurance new under consideration for bargaining purposes as part of the general settlement and as a special concession in respect of those islands* 4* Copy ef this letter is being sent t© the Admiralty, Air Ministry, Board of Trade, Colonial Office and Dominions Office.

Sir, With reference to the Foreign Office letter of February -itn last inviting the observations «f the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on the draft Persian bill regarding territorial waters, I am directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to transmit to you the accompanying copy of a farther telegram from His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, enquiring whether His Majesty's Government would in any / / circumstances be prepared to consider a special agreement with / / the Persian Government on this subject. 8. The memorandum to which Sir R.Clive refers is the reply 0± ' His Government in the United Kingdom to the League of Nations &lt;iuesticnnaire regarding territorial waters, which was sent to the League of Nations in December last and will in due course be circulated to the Persian Government, as . member of the League. The paragraph, to which Sir R.Clive draws special attention run as follows:- 'His Majesty's Government accept the view that no State can be expected to tolerate with equanimity, circumstances arising under which, owing to peculiar local circumstances, the absence of jurisdiction over foreign vessels on the high seas immediately contiguous to its territorial waters may prejudice gravely the enforcement of the laws, or the well-being of the community within its territory. The Under-Secretary of State, 'Where/ India Office, S. W. 1.Where such circumstances arise, it is the duty of* any ioreign State to come to an agreement enabling the State concerned to exercise such rights of control orer the merchant vessels of the ioreign State concluding the agreement as may be necessary. For a State to refuse to enter into an agreement of this kind would be to show an entire absence of the consideration lor the rights of other States upon which the solidarity of nations depends’*. 3. It appears to Sir Austen Chamberlain that in view of the wording of these paragraphs, it would be impossible for His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom t© avoid considering a special agreement with the Persian Government, if the Persian Government stated that the absence of such an agreement would prejudice gravely the enforcement of the Persia laws against smuggling; and he is of opinion that it may be a ell for His Majesty’s Government, if approached by the Persian Government on these lines, to state their readiness to come to a special agreement whereby the Persian Customs Preventive Service would be given the right to search British ships below a certain tonnage in certain areas contiguous to Persian territorial waters, in order to stop smuggling. Otherwise, in the absence of any international recognition of the principle of the three-mile limit, Persia might conceivably advance a claim to an eight-mile limit, or even mare. It might well be of advantage, if only to secure the adherence of Persia to the principle that no jurisdiction can be exercised outside the three-mile limit without concluding a special agreement with the foreign State concerned, for His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to conclude such a special agreement with the Persian Government. 4. Kevertheless, the difficulties to which any agreement giring Persia a special right of search outside the three-mile limit would give rise O in connexion with Arab shipping/hhhhhhhhibhhihhbi 3. shipping are so great that Sir Austen Chanberlaln considers it undesirable that Sir R.Clive should raise the question. The Persian Government have not themselves raised it hitherto, and, should they do so, it would be well for Sir R.Clive to reply merely that the proposal is one which he will refer to His Majesty^ Government. . 5. In Sir R.Clive’s telegram No.93, a copy of which is also enclosed herein for convenience of reference, an agreement on these lines is suggested as one of the ways in which His Majesty’s Government could, if this were considered desirable, assist the Persian Government in their contraband diliiculties. Another of his suggestions is that His Majesty's Government should guarantee that the islands of Tamb and Abu Musa will not become depots for smuggling. In Sir Austen Chamberlain's opinion, it might be feasible to give effect to this suggestion in a modified form, but it is definitely undesirable that His Majesty's Government should themselves permanently undertake binding obligations and guarantees of this nature. He considers, however, that it might be possible to give the Persian Government an assurance, as part of a general settlement, that the Arab Sheikh who owns the islands in question will take the necessary measures to prevent smuggling on a large scale from them into Ifersia. 6. I am to enquire whether Viscount Peel desires to olfer any ouservations on these questions, and whether he would agree to the despatch of a reply to Sir R.Clive on the lines indicated above. 7. A similar letter is being sent to the Admiralty, and a copy of this correspondence has been sent to the Air Ministry, the Board of Trade, the Colonial Office and the Dominions Office.

Although Sir R.Clive has already been informed by telegraph of the general views of His Majesty’s Government on this question, and although the Persian Minister of Court has undertaken not to submit the bill to the Persian majlis for the present and possibly not at all, the Secretary of State feels that it would be desirable to consider this question in all its aspects. I am therefore to invite the observations of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on Sir R.Clive’s despatch and its enclosures. 3.

Territorial Waters. I. —His Majesty’s Government in Great Britain agree that the rights which States possess over their territorial waters are rights of sovereignty. They are not aware of any case in which special rights of another State are recognised, restricting or excluding the rights of the coastal State in the belt. II. —The sovereign rights of the coastal State extend to the air space above,, and to the sea bottom below, the belt of territorial waters, and also to the sub-soil below that sea bottom. III. — (a.) The breadth of the belt of territorial waters subject to the sovereignty of the coastal State is 3 miles.* {b.) His Majesty’s Government in Great Britain do not admit and have always protested against the claim of any foreign State to exercise sovereignty over a greater breadth of territorial water than 3 miles.* (c.) No claim is made by His Majesty’s Government in Great Britain to exercise rights over the high seas outside the belt of territorial waters. There are certain banks outside the 3-mile limit off the coasts of various British dependencies on which sedentary fisheries of oysters, pearl oysters, chanks or beches de mer on the sea bottom are practised, and which have by long usage come to be regarded as the subject of occupation and property. The foregoing answer is not intended to exclude claims to the sedentary fisheries on these banks. The question is understood to relate only to claims to exercise rights over the waters of the high seas. (d.) Claims by foreign States to exercise rights of jurisdiction or control over the waters of the high seas adjacent to the belt of territorial waters of those States have never been admitted and have always been objected to by His Majesty’s Government in Great Britain. His Majesty’s Government admit that the speed of modern vessels and aircraft and the immense range and power of modern implements of warfare may render a belt of 3 miles insufficient to prevent injurious consequences resulting in the national territory from acts which have taken place on the high seas, but this affords no sufficient argument for a change in the 3-mile limit. To ensure that no injurious consequence should result within the national territory from an act which has taken place on the high seas, it would be necessary to establish a belt so wide as to constitute a serious encroachment on the high seas. A belt of such width would lead to perpetual disputes. The difficulty of determining with accuracy whether a vessel is within the coastal belt would be increased very largely if the width of that belt were increased, as the greater the distance from the shore, the more difficult it is to fix by reference to the shore the exact position of the vessel. Furthermore, the burden imposed on neutral States in time of war would be intolerable. His Majesty’s Government accept the view that no State can be expected to tolerate with equanimity, circumstances arising under which, owing to peculiar local circumstances, the absence of jurisdiction over foreign vessels on the high seas immediately contiguous to its territorial waters may prejudice gravely the enforce ment of the laws, or the well-being of the community within its territory. * Note. —The word “ miles,” wherever used in the present memorandum, should be understood to mean nautical miles, of which there are sixty to a degree. 4524a [18373] B2 ( Where such circumstances arise, it is the duty of any foreign State to come to an agreement enabling the State concerned to exercise such rights of control over the merchant vessels of the foreign State concluding the agreement as may be necessary. For a State to refuse to enter into an agreement of this kind would be to show an entire absence of the consideration for the rights of other States upon which the solidarity of nations depends. (£•)—(1.) A convention fixing a uniform breadth of 3 miles for all States and for all purposes is both possible and desirable. (2.) His Majesty’s Government in Great Britain are not aware of any special circumstances which would justify or necessitate the fixing of some distance other than 3 miles as the width of the belt of territorial waters for any particular States. (3.) Arrangements of the kind suggested in III (d) should be embodied in bilateral conventions between the States concerned. There is no need for a multilateral convention. It is only in rare cases that circumstances would require the conclusion of a special arrangement of this sort; and the terms of the arrange ment should be varied to meet the needs of the particular case Determination of the Base Line. IV.— (a.) Along the coasts the base line is the line of mean low-water spring tides, following the sinuosities of the coast, and not a line drawn from point to point, either of the coast or islands or rocks. Consequently, distance between islands and the coast is not to be taken into account in this connexion. A belt of territorial waters will be measured from low-water on the islands in the same way that it is measured along the coasts. (h.) In front of bays the base line from which the territorial waters are measured passes across the mouth of the bay from the land on one side to the land on the other side A bay for this purpose is something more pronounced than a mere curvature of the coast. There must be a distinct and well-defined inlet, moderate in size, and long in proportion to its width. The question of the breadth of a bay arose in the North Atlantic Fisheries Arbitration at The Hague in 1910. The Tribunal there decided that in the case of a bay the belt of territorial waters must be measured from a line drawn across the body of water at the place where it ceased to have the configuration and characteristics of a bay.* Realising that this decision would in practice be insufficient to define the rights of the parties and to prevent future difficulties with regard to the fisheries, the Tribunal, basing itself on various treaties in respect of fisheries to which Great Britain was a party, recommended that in general the base line should be drawn across the bay in the part nearest the entrance or mouth at the first point where the width did not exceed 10 miles. The recommendations of the Tribunal were accepted by both parties to the dispute and have since been enforced in the area to which they apply. His Majesty’s Government in Great Britain believe that it is logical to restrict the application of the special rule as to bays, under which the base line is drawn across the mouth of the bay, to cases where the bay is not more than 6 miles wide at the mouth, as it is only in these cases that the bay is wholly enclosed by the two belts of territorial waters measured from the opposite shores. It may be argued, however, that no such rule has as yet met with universal acceptance, and, therefore, if a rule similar to the recommendations of the Tribunal in the North Atlantic Fisheries Arbitration and to the rule adopted in some of the fishery treaties to which Great Britain is a party met with general acceptance, they would be prepared to consider it. By general acquiescence certain historic bays have been recognised as forming part of the national territory, even though their width exceeds that indicated in the earlier part of the answer on this point. In the case of such bays the territorial waters are measured from a base line passing across the bay at the place recognised as forming the limits of the national territory. In the case of bays whose coasts belong to two or more States, the territorial waters are measured from low water and follow the sinuosities of the coast. (c.) In front of ports the base line from which the territorial waters are measured passes across the entrance from the outermost point or harbour work on one side to the outermost point or harbour work on the other side. The word “port” in this connexion is used in its ordinary physical or * Answer to Question 5; Award. (Cd. 5396.)•09 geographical sense without reference to special definitions of the areas of particular ports which may be laid down in the customs legislation of a country. V. —A belt of waters round an island will constitute territorial waters, whether the island is near the mainland or far from it. This belt will be 3 miles wide and will be measured from low water following the sinuosities of the coast of the island. In the case of a group of islands, each island will possess its own belt of territorial waters whatever the distance between the islands; there will not be a single belt for the whole group. VI. —An island is a piece of territory surrounded by water and in normal cir cumstances permanently above high water. It does not include a piece of territory not capable of effective occupation and use. His Majesty’s Government consider that there is no ground for claiming that a belt of territorial waters exists round rocks and banks not constituting islands as defined above, and would view with favour an international agreement to this effect in order that there may be no doubt as to the status of the waters round such rocks and banks and round artificial structures raised upon them. VII. —The waters of a strait will be territorial if they lie within 3 miles of the shore of the strait, because they will fall within the 3 miles of water measured from low-water mark following the sinuosities of the coast. Where a strait is less than 6 miles wide at each entrance and both shores form part of the territory of the same State, it is immaterial whether the shores are, in the interior part of the strait, more than 6 miles apart; all the waters will in this case be territorial. Where the shores of the strait belong to different States, the waters on either side up to 3 miles from the shore are territorial waters; if the total width of the strait is less than 6 miles, the waters on either side will be territorial waters of the State to which the shore belongs up to midway between the two shores. If a strait less than 6 miles wide is the only access to an inland sea and both shores of the strait and all the shores of the inland sea are subject to the same sovereignty, the waters of the strait and the inland sea will be treated on the same footing as the interior waters of a bay. The waters of the strait and of the inland sea will form part of the national territory; the base line from which the territorial waters are measured will pass across the entrance of the strait. If the strait is more than 6 miles wide, the belt of territorial waters will follow the sinuosities of the coast, and the waters more than 3 miles from the shore, both in the strait and the inland sea, will, unless the strait and sea are recognised as a territorial inlet of the same character as a historic bay, form part of the high seas. If the shores of the inland sea are not subject to the same sovereignty as the shores of the strait, the waters of the inland sea more than 3 miles from the shore are high seas, and the waters of the strait and of the inland sea within 3 miles of the shore will be territorial waters of the State to which the shore belongs. VIII. —In the case of a port and a bay, the line of demarcation between the national waters and the territorial waters will be the base line from which the 3-mile belt of territorial waters is measured in accordance with the answer to IV (b) and IV (c) above. In the case of the mouth of a river, if the river debouches into an estuary, the river is part of the national territory and its waters are national waters; the estuary is to be treated as a bay. Where the river does not debouch into an estuary, but falls direct into the sea, the waters of the river must be regarded as constituting national waters, even if the mouth of the river is more than 6 miles wide. The line of demarcation would in this case be a base line drawn across the river at its mouth, and the belt of territorial waters would be measured from such base line. IX. —Foreign warships and merchant vessels have a right of innocent passage through territorial waters. A right of innocent passage is also recognised for submarines, provided that they are navigating on the surface of the water (convention relating to the regime of the Straits, signed at Lausanne, the 24th July, 1923, annex, paragraph 3 (a) : Admiralty memorandum as to the procedure regarding the visits of foreign war vessels to Great Britain and Northern Ireland, paragraph 3). [18373] b 24 Vessels exercising the right of passage through foreign territorial waters are entitled to anchor when this is incidental to navigation. They are also entitled to anchor in case of distress. The right of innocent passage is not limited to the hull of the ship, but extends to the persons and goods she is carrying; but the essence of the right is that it is one of innocemt 'passage, and the vessels cannot claim to transport through territorial waters persons or goods whose presence there is prejudicial to the safety, good order or revenues of the State. X. —States are entitled to regulate the passage of foreign warships through their territorial waters and the anchoring of such warships therein. A copy of the Admiralty memorandum, containing the regulations to which foreign warships entering the territorial waters or ports of Great Britain and Northern Ireland are expected to conform, is annexed.* If a foreign warship fails to comply with the regulations issued by the authori ties of the State whose ports or waters she enters, the attention of her commanding officer should be called to the fact of such non-compliance. If failure is persisted in, the foreign warship may be required to depart. XI. —His Majesty’s Government in Great Britain agree that the proposed Conference for the Codification of the Law relating to Territorial Waters should not include in the scope of its work questions relating to war and neutrality. XII. —The sovereignty of a State extends to all persons and to all things within its territory; and the rights which a State enjoys over its territorial waters are rights of sovereignty. It follows that foreign vessels and the persons and things on board, wdien passing through or anchored in the territorial waters of the State, are subjected to the sovereignty of the State unless by the accepted rules of international law they are entitled to immunity from the local jurisdiction (foreign vessels of war, diplomatic agents, &amp;c.). States do not in practice exercise jurisdictional rights over foreign vessels which are merely passing through their territorial waters. There would be no advantage to themselves in doing so, and the exercise of such jurisdic tion would be burdensome to the foreign vessels. Rights of jurisdiction are in practice only exercised where it is necessary to do so in the interests of good govern ment, but the State itself must be the judge whether or not the interests of good government require it. The good sense of Governments has rendered unnecessary any attempt to conclude agreements as to the occasions on which jurisdiction shall or shall not be exercised. States are deterred from attempts to enforce their jurisdic tion unreasonably over vessels passing through their territorial waters by the consideration that if they did so they could not complain if their own merchant vessels when passing through the territorial waters of foreign States were subjected to similar treatment. The State is not precluded from exercising jurisdiction {a) in civil, or {b) in criminal cases, over foreign merchant vessels or persons or property on board when passing through its territorial waters. Jurisdiction is not limited to occurrences happening during the passage. It may be exercised to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as on the national territory. No distinction as to the exercise of jurisdiction is to be made in law according to whether the vessel is passing through the territorial waters on its way to or from a port of the coast State or not, but in practice a State would be much less disposed to exercise jurisdiction because of something which happened within its territorial waters if the vessel were not coming to or going from one of its ports than if it were doing so. Nor should any distinction be made in law according to whether the effect of the occurrence does or does not extend beyond the ship itself or the persons on board, but in fact and in practice the distinction is of the first importance. The question whether or not the State feels called upon to exercise jurisdiction depends upon whether or not the exigencies of good government require that such jurisdiction should be exercised. If the effect of the occurrences on board the foreign vessel extends beyond the vessel herself and those on board, the exigencies of good government are more likely to require that jurisdiction should be exercised. A State is entitled to arrest a person on board a vessel passing through its territorial waters. * Not printed.XIII. —The right of innocent passage must not be subordinated to the payment of dues in return for the mere passage through the territorial waters. Juridically there can be no objection to the levying of dues in return for services rendered, but in order to obviate disputes as to whether those services were necessary, it is desirable that arrangements for their imposition and recovery should be embodied |^n international conventions. It would be contrary to the comity of nations that there should be any inequality or discrimination in the levying of the dues. As a general principle, dues should not be levied on vessels forced to enter territorial waters in distress. XIV. —The pursuit of a foreign vessel commenced within the national jurisdiction may be continued on the high seas; such pursuit must be continuous; it is not restricted to any zone adjacent to the territorial waters of the State; it must cease at the limits of the territorial waters of a foreign State. XV. —His Majesty’s Government in Great Britain consider that it would be advantageous if agreement were reached as to the exercise of jurisdiction by the territorial State over a foreign merchant-vessel lying in one of its ports. They do not regard the question as falling strictly within the subject to be submitted to the proposed Codification Conference as defined in the Resolution of the Assembly, adopted on the 27th September, 1927, because the waters of a port are not technically part of the territorial waters of the State, but in the hope that an agreement might be reached they think that it would be desirable that the point should be regarded as included in the subject for consideration. In the opinion of His Majesty’s Government in Great Britain, the State is entitled to exercise jurisdiction over a foreign merchant vessel lying in its ports and over persons and goods on board. In criminal matters it is not usual for the authorities to intervene and enforce the local jurisdiction, unless their assistance is invoked by or on behalf of the local representative of the flag State, or those in control of the ship, or a person directly concerned, or unless the peace or good order of the port is likely to be affected. In every case it is for the authorities of the State to judge whether or not to intervene. In civil matters, the State is entitled to exercise jurisdiction on a merchant vessel lying in its ports or on property on board, whenever the jurisdiction is invoked by private litigants, but where the suit is initiated against the vessel or the property, the vessel or property on board should always be released on giving bail or security.

The British Government held that in the absence of international agreement, three miles was the extent of territorial waters, but the Persian Government claimed distances of up to twelve miles at various times. The issue is discussed by various British officials, especially the Foreign Office, Admiralty, and HM Minister, Tehran. Folios 84-120 discuss Persian jurisdiction over the outer anchorage in Bushire. Folios 9-79 discuss the concession area held by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, in view of the fact that potential oil fields lay under the Persian Gulf, partly beyond the three-mile limit, but within the twelve-mile limit claimed by the Persian Government.The French language content of the file consists of six folios of diplomatic correspondence between British and Persian officials.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Admiralty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kowr-e Deyreh (anchorage)</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial waters</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00016b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
