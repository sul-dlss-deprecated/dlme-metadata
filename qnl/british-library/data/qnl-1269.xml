Dear Sir, We enclose herewith copies of correspondence received by us on the subject of full duty being charged to Imperial Airways on the c.i.f value of goods imported by them into Bahrein. Their contention is that air freight is in most cases out of all proportion to the value of goods and that some consideration should be granted them in this connection. This matter was put before the Adviser to the Government, Acting on behalf of the Director of Customs and we would refer you to his reply attached hereto. A Copy of this letter was forwarded to the Manager, Near East Area.,Cairo, who, in his letter of the 16th ultimo addressed to us desires the matter to t be placed before you in order to bring about amicable settlement. of Imperial Airways, with the Bahrein Government and advise us as to what can be done in this connection. We shall be glud if you will take up this subject on behalfc O p J- I^PERIAL AIHW. So. S7/4/10, 59 7/j%5B k YS UNITED Cairo 3th August 19 33 Tie ^esopotemi£ Persie. Corporation Ltd., Sr ei n. Lear Sirs, t thank you for your memorandum IJ/MZ of 2nd Auguet vdth regard to the question of the declared value of our stores which are offloaded at Bahrein. The point you raise is really one which has caused us quite a considerable amount of difficulty in the past, and I think it should be tackled now in the right manner in order to get the matter settled satisfactorily in the future. Nearly all the Customs AdministKations charge duty on c. i. f value of the goods imported. This has caused a certain amount of annoyance to consignees in the case of freight, as owing to the high rates paid for sir freightage, the c. i. f value of goods sent by air is increased enormously and it is necessary some-times to pay duty on more than double the value of the goods themselves. Very often, in fact, in the case of cheap goods wni ch are urgently needed and are therefore sent by air, the majority of the duty paid has been on the actual freightage on the goods, the declared value itself being a very small proportion. Most Customs Administsations have admitted that this state of affairs is quite definitely unlair, as i t penalises goods sent by air and subtsacts to a great extent from the value of ourservices for freight. In tvo instances, therefore *e have managed to get them to agree to assessing duty on the declared value of the goods plus a third of the air freightage, this proportion being about equal to the freight rates *hich would have been paid had the goods been sent by surface transport. I think it might be suggested to the Director of Customs at Bahrein that he should adopt the same procedure. Actually, of course, with regard to stores, we do not pay freightage on these goods ourselves as they are carried free on our own services. Further, all stores in transit are covered by a floating policy and we do not pay ordinary insurance rates. I should be glad if you would do your best to persuade the Director of Customs that as we do not pay any freight rates or insurance on our own stores, we should only be charged duty on the declared value of the goods, as this is really equal to the c. i. f value. Would you please let me know the result of your we negotiations in this respect. If you think it advisable, jlmm will write direct to the Director of Customs from here, laying the facte « before him and asking him to make the decision on the lines outlined above. Yours faithfully, S/d Per Pro, Imperial Airways Ltd., Manager, ^ear East Area,* fco. iv ' 5 *' 1 Bahrein is4th August 19 23 The rirector of Customs, Bahrein^ rear Sir, With reference to the question raised in regard to the declared value oi stores etc, , imported on account of Imperial Airways; we enclose herewith a copy oi a letter received irom the Company in this connection.
