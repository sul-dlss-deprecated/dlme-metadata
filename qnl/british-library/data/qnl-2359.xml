If Dr. Blegvad fceapa to Persian territorial waters or the High leas no problems, of course, arise. 3. In order ho&gt; ever to co-relate his information with cond itions on the Arab Coast he may wish to enter Arab territorial waters and his vessel, being in the employ of the Iranian Government, will presumably fly the Iranian flag and will be temporarily at all events, an Iranian Government craft. 4. Though this Is the case the vessel will not be a vessel of war, and, this being 30 , It appear* to me that for a mere visit (i.e. to refuel etc.), under International law and pract ice, the Iranian Governnent will not have to give official notification to, or seeJt pemission from, the Hulers of the Arab btetes. if this notification or permission were necessary action/- 2 - action would h£ve to be t&amp;iten by the Iranian Governsent through u^. 5# It, however. Dr. Blegvad wishes to carry out Invest- liationg in Arab waters then pemission itust be obtained by the Iranian Goverrosent through us froa the Arab Juler* conternedi 6. In considering whether Arab Rulers should or should not be advised by us to give such permission the fact will have to be borne in nind that the e activities may quite probably not be welcomed by the local artbs, especially in the less settled eeastal areas, :/ho nay suspect Dr.Blegvad, (doubtless quite wrongly) of having designs on their pearl h&amp;nJts or fishing grounds.

Before orders are passed on the subject we should be glad to receive any information that you possess or can conveniently obtain which would throw light on the fresh points mentioned in this recent correspondence, namely, (a) the extent of Persian interest in the Arab pearling banks, as to which the only information we can trace at present is the reference in Lorimer, page 2240; (b) the existence and location of pearl beds in deep water; and •(c) the belief that deep sea dredging would destroy the colonies from which the shallow beds are recruited. m lf / The Kon’ble Lieut.Colonel Sir T.C.W.Fowle, K.C.I.L. , C.3.L. , H.B.M.’s Consulate-General, Bushire.If you have any confimation that this belief is held locally we can make enquiries here into the question whether it has any scientific basis.

(Sgd.) J- P. GIBSONOf* L\ W ?.Z . 75 21/38 . CONFIDENTIAL- Military Branch, M.05,695/38. Admiralty, S.W.l. 5th November, 1938. Dear Gibson, Will you please refer to your letters P.Z.5432/38 of the 26th September and the 26th October on the subject of the pearl fisheries in the Persian Gulf ? Apart from the question of the interests of the Persians in the Arab fisheries, referred to below, there appears to us to be no difficulty in maintaining the view - (i) that the Arab States have exclusive rights to the fisheries in their territorial waters. (ii) that they ha^e established exclusive proprietary rights to fisheries outside territorial waters which it can be shown they have been accustomed to fish. (iii) that H.M.Government is entitled, in view of its special position in the Gulf, to exclude aliens, on behalf of any or all of the Sheixhs, from the above grounds. The difficulty therefore arises over (a) shallow beds outside territorial waters which the Arabs have not in fact worked. (b) deeu beds outside territorial waters, which the ^ ' Arabs could not in fact fish without mechanical equipment. As regards (a), the Admiralty view is tnat we can safely take the line that, without the necessity for clear evidence that any particular bed has oeen worxed, tne shallow beds as a whole are subject to the exclusive right of the Arab Spates. It would indeed probably ce impracticable to collect evidence that a particular bed nas or has not been worked, and it would therefore be unsafe to/ J.P.Gibson, Esq., India Office, S.W. 1.r\ JV 2. to adopt any procedure requiring the production of such evidence. The rea.L difficulty therefore arises over the beds at (b). i.e. those too deep for working by human agency alone, which the Arabs therefore could not have fished. As regards these beds we are unable to agree with the view in Baggallay’s letter that they are not of sufficient interest to the Sheikhs to warrant protection irom intruders. It seems clear that - (i) Loca.l belief is that spoliation of the deeper beds would injure the shallow beds; (ii) Any intrusion into the Gulf of expeditions equipped with modern apparatus would be strongly resented by the Arabs who would consider we had failed to protect them; (iii) It is most unlikely that the Japanese intruder would confine himself strictly to the deep beds. We consider, therefore, that every effort should be made to protect the deep beds. Whether they can in fact be protected is a different matter, but for the present we would suggest that the most hopeful line seems to be to base our claim on the belief mentioned in Lorimer’s Gazetteer that deep sea dredging would destroy the colonies from which the shallow beds are recruited. Iz would therefore seem to us very valuable if seme scientific evidence could be obtained in support of this belief and perhaps the India Office could undertake to secure some plausible evidence in favour of such a contention. Should the need for action arise before we have managed to establish a more or less legal claim, it will probably be necessary to adopt, so far as possible, a policy/3. policy of bluff. There should be no difficulty, as in tne past, in adopting such a policy aga.inst non-Japanese intruders: whether or not it could be successfully adopted against the Japanese will no doubt have to be considered at the time when the need arises. We presune, of course, that use would be made of such measures as withdrawing protection and refusing supplies, although this would probably not affect a self-contained Japanese unit. There is admittedly the further difficulty in that tne location of the deep beds, - and indeed the existence of any deep beds, - does not seem to be known, but this appears inevitable so long as fishing in the Gulf is restricted to unaided human divers. Possibly, however, there may be some local knowledge based on the explorations of sane particularly adventurous or skilful divers available in the Gulf which is not known in London. Perhaps therefore you could ask the local authorities to report all nhat they know. It seems also that we should obtain some up to date iniormation as to the exact interest of the Persians in the fisheries not in their own territorial waters, as our informat ion at present seems to be based largely on the statement in Lorimer’s Gazetteer published in 1915. It seems, however, that there is no great danger of arousing Persian opposition under the procedure suggested in the Government of India’s letter of the 27th April, 1938, since under this procedure the King’s Regulation will not actually be published until the need arises for excluding an alien (and then with the minimum publicity). Moreover/7 v * I - ' '(^o) i * Moreover, the interests of the Persians would he the same as ours, namely, to keep out the alien and it is unlikely that they will feel moved to raise difficulties if they see we are taking the odium for action which is equally in their own interests. T .7hi 1 e we do not, therefore, consider that Persian interest would he a har to any action necessary to exclude intruders, it does seem desirable for the matter to he cleared up and perhaps you will ask your local advisers t o report. With reference to paragraph 4 of your letter, we ould have no object ion to your revised wording, unless you would perhaps prefer 'fisheries in which Bahreini nationals have established proprietary rights'. As regards any action to he taken at the present we are entirely in agreement with the course suggested in the Government of India’s letter of the 27th April, 1938. I am sending a copy of this letter to Baggallay. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) P.H. Jones.P.2.7041/38 INDIA.

Lorimer (p.2244) mentions the view of some authorities that 'the effect of deep-sea dredging would be to destroy the colonies from which the oysters upon the shallow beds accessible to native oivers are recruited.' If this view is correct the Arabs might have a very good reason for feeling aggrieved if the deep water beds were exploited by foreigners. But it is difficult to see what effective action can be taken if the Arabs have no valid claim to rights over those beds. The problem was in fact dealt with in the reference made to the Law Officers in 1904. In their opinion they drew a distinction between the pearling banks resorted to by the Arabs outside territorial waters and the deeper waters which had not yet been fished by pearl divers. They reported th*t they could not see that 'the right claimed by the tribe* to exclude other nations from these deeper waters could be asserted with any reasonable chance of success’. In respect both of the deeper waters and of the pearl banks outside the three-mile limit they recommended that foreign interference/ P.H. Jones , !£sq. , Admiralty.&amp;r &lt;\ interference should be discouraged by the refusal of supplies, etc., as had been suggested by the Government of India. 3. As regards paragraph 4 of Baggallay's letter it is an unwelcome complication that the Arab Sheikhs may not after all possess an exclusive prescriptive right to the pearling banks outside territorial waters. Possibly the prohibition on poachers to be enforced by a King’s Regulation could, if necessary, be framed so as not to apply to Persians; e.g. it might extend only to persons who are not nationals of countries bordering on the Persian Gulf (though this would let in Iraqis and Saudis). The Persian Government could not then complain that the rights of their nationals were affected. They might, however, object to our assuming, without their consent, the rdle of protector of rights shared by their nationals with our prot^g^s. The question how far Persians share with Arabs prescriptive rights in the pearling banks on the Arab side of the Gulf is one on which we shall have to consult the Political Resident. 4. I might also mention a minor point of drafting that occurs tome in connexion with Baggallay’s letter. It would hardly be correct to speak of the fisheries long reserved to Bahreini nationals when the banks are the common property of all the tribes. Perhaps something like 'flshexiss which have long been operated by Bahreini nationals” would do. 5. I am sending a copy of this letter to Baggallay. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) J.P. GIBSON.* P-Z-7041/38. (E 5657/48/91) FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 13th October, 1938. dear Gibeon, Many thanka for your letter P.Z.5432/38 of the 26th September last about the question of protecting the \rab pearl fisheries in the Persian Gulf against encroachments by foreigners. 2. were Yery interested in the new information contained in the Government of India’s letter about the presence of pearl fishing beds in deep water in the Persian Gulf which have never been exploited by the Arab Sheikhs. did not realise that such beds existed and I think it is clear, although I have not verified this point, that no question of claiming them has ever arisen before. Lorimer's Gazetteer merely states (Volume 1, Part II, page 2,221, paragraph 5) that it is possible thst such deep sea pearl banks exist, and 1 imagine that even now very few people share this knowledge. Assigning that they do exist, however, we agree with the Government of India that the Arab Sheikhs would have no legal claim to them, and, this being so, we do not think that it would be possible, whatever the circumstances, to issue a warning-off notice in respect of these beds or take forcible action to prevent anyone from fishing there, however damaging to British prestige in the Gulf such inaction might be. Since, however, the Arab Sheikhdoms have never exploited these banks, there seems no reason why they should be aggrieved if foreigners do so, or why the prestige of His Majesty’s Government should fall if they allowed it, even though the Sheikhs might say that they would have used the banks if and when they had known of their existence and possessed the necessary equipment. J.P.Gibson, Esq. 3./3. ) 2 As regards the pearling banks lying (l) within territorial waters and (2) in shallow waters outside this limit (I note in this connexion that Lorimer says they occur anything up to 70 miles from the coast'', we agree that in view of the considerations mentioned in the Government of India’s letter it might be undesirable to risk representations from the Iranian Government by issuing a proclamation now, but that there would be no harm in having a Proclamation and King’s Regulation in readiness for use in case any attempt should be made on these banks. In view, however, of the distinction between these banks and those lying in deep water, the King’s Regulation would have to be carefully worded so as to avoid making it apparent that this distinction existed, e.g. it might refer to the 'fisheries which have long been reserved to Bahreini nationals' or words to thf&gt;t effect. This would have the advantage of not committing His Majesty’s Government either way as regards the deep sea banks and at the same time of discouraging would-be poachers, who would probably be unaware of the distinction between these banks and the others. If, however, His Majesty’s Ships were then authorized to take forcible action, they would, I think, have to be instructed only to do so in the case of those banks to which the Arab Sheikhs have a reasonable claim. 4. There is one further point which we think merits investigation. On page 2240 of Lorimer it is stated that 'On the Arabian side all the banks, whether near 'or far from the coast, are free to the pearl-fishers 'of Arabia and Persia without distinction of race or 'nationality'. If this statement is accurate it may be difficult to exclude Persians from the banks on the basis of prescription. Moreover it is hardly consistent with the information on the subject apparently given to the Law Officers on which they based/-&lt;4 3. ■b^fled their opinion of 11th February, 1905 (see pa^e 2248 of Lorimer). It seems from the information in Lorimer that the Persians have continued to keep the banks on the Persian side for themselves, but have habitually fished on the Arabian banks. Yours ever, (Sgd.)

Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to invite your assistance in regard to a matter connected with the pearl fisheries in the Persian Gulf. These fisheries are an important, indeed in some cases the principal means of livelihood of the Independent Shaikhdoms of North Eastern Arabia over whom the British Governnuant exercises a certain measure of control and protection. Exploitation is conducted entirely by the local inhabitants without any sort of modern equipment, and is ajcordingly restricted to the summer months and to shoals at a depth of not more than 20 fathoms. Government has consistently discouraged attempts by European firms to enter this trade, in view of the economic effects which competition based on the use of modern equipment would exercise on these small communities. There is a strong local belief, naturally untested, that these shallow beds are recruited annually from certain ddepsea beds , inaccessible to local methods and that any attempts to fish from these deep sea beds also would be disastrous to the productivity of the area as a whole. The Persian Gulf fisheries have never The Secretary The British Museum (Natural HistoryJ Cromwell Hoad, S.^.7c apparently been studied from this point of view by a competant marine biologist, and as a matter of interest and for future reference i^ord Zetland would be glad to have an authoritative opinion on this theory, based on experience gained from observation in other waters, either in connection with pearling or with other fisheries of a similar nature, I am to request that this inquiry, though not of any present urgency or importance, may be treated as confidential, at least to the extent that foreign experts should not be consulted, 1 am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, 3dPeelC.4 3339/39. British Museum (natural History), Cromwell Hoad, London, S«W«7* 7 th July, 1939. Confide ntial Sir 1 am directed by th® Trustees of the British Museum to refer to Mr .Peel’s letter, P.Z.2118/39, of the 19th April on the subject of pearl fisheries in the Persian gulf. The Trustees directed me to state for the information of Lord Zetland that the questions raised in the letter under reply have been considered by the appropriate members of the scientific staff in this Museum and that the literature on the subject has been consulted. The Trustees are advised that research on the pearl fisheries of Ceylon have demonstrated that - (1) the pearl banks all lie at depths between 5 and 12 fathioms; (2) the pearl oyster begins to reproduce at the age of 12 months and produces large numbers of veil gors twice a year; (3) pearls are usually produced by oysters between the ages of 2i and 4 years; (4) owing to the set of the currents the fry is frequently carried away from the oyster banks and perishes with the result that only occasionally are there years when the banks are worth fishing; ( 5 ) the authorities are of opinion that pearl fishing is likely to result only to a negligible extent in diminishing the fishery in the future. The chief enemies of the pearl oysters are not the pearl fishers, but rays and other fishes and molluscs. It would appear that in the case of the Persian Qilf the conditions under heading (4) differ from those in Ceylon, but those indicated under theother headings are likely to be similar in both cases. Since the oysters be^.n to reproduce at least a year before they are fit to fish, the fishing is unlikely to affect the maintenance of the stock unless it is conducted on such lines as to destroy the mature oysters which have not yet begun to produce pearls. There is no reason to suppose that a deep-sea pearl fishery could profitably be established, butthe opinion of those who have been consulted is that if such a iiaxitr^ v/ere established it would be scarcely likely to affect the oyster population in the steam shallower beds.

To The Under Secretery of State for India. Sir, T ^ in reply to your letter P.Z.4225/39 of 12 . 7.39 I may say that when Director of the Sudan Government Pearl Fishery I obtained what information was then available on the Persian Gulf Pesrl Fisheries. It was not uuc.i, as evidently they had never been examined by a biologist, and nothing was known about them from the fisherman's point of view. There has recently been a Danisn Scientific Fisheries Expedition to the Gulf. I gather that its work was principally on the Iranian side, the headquarters of the pearling’ boats and trsdc being at Bahrein, on the western side. Would you like me to enquire whether they saw anything of the Pearl Fishery? xY-ec-nwnile tne following information may be useful.- (1) xhere are two pearl oysters which are fished in the Gulf, -l or the small oyster, Pinctade vulgar is (the name has seen changed again, but vulgar is is the name in any literature which matters) Arabic Bilbil, and the large oyseer, ?. margaritifera, Arabic T sadaf ' knovvn to the trade as 'Bombay Shell'. (2) Tne habits of these two species are very different, as I found during my work in the lied Sec, where both occur. (3) The Ceylon Fishery is for the small oyster, or Bilbil, and is for the Pearls alone, the shell being practically valueless. Therefore there can be no practical fishery unless she oyster occurs in vast numbers. In the cas^ of t-^e large shell, or sadaf, the shell is tne main object, j. ^ er j- i j //V4 Oi. pearls adding something like 10/6 to to their value. ( 4 ) In the Red Sea Bilbil is occasionally taken, but the differ completely from those of Ceylon, the only fishery which lias been reported upon by a biologist. ( 5 ) I do not know how fishing is done in the Iranian Gulf. It is quite possible that the same boat may take both species. ( 6 ) From my experiences with diving dresses in the Red Sea I decided that, unless shell is very thick on the bottom, as on my artificial beds, naked diving was the cheaper. Europeans often seem to have the fixed idea that modern machinery is sure to be the more efficient, and the fact that I did not find it so in the Red Bea (except in the very special circumstances of my artificial beds) might save trouble in dealing with the requests referred to in your letter 2118/39 to the Director of the naturrl History Mus eum. (?) The same letter refers to fishing on 'shoals at a depth of not more than 20 fathoms'. Hone of my divers could descend to greater depths than 10 fathoms, and negroes. I do not think any nakad diver can go deeper tnan this, and 20 fms is deen even for a man in a diving suit. fishery is .almost entirely for sadaf. The methods used then it was a haphazard performance only indulged in by■ A Par. o . Phe ‘better grov?n the saell the oettcr the ae^rl, and, oh course, the old shells ar.:, in general, the only ones lihely to contain pearls of any size. It is not true, for sadaf, that stunted and deformed shells produce a grcater value of pearls. Par.4. Bilbil in the Red Sea, as in Ceylon is a delicate creature which I found difficult to rear above the age of one or two years. Sadaf, on the other hand, is very hardy. In my opinion it is lively that to this constitutional delicacy should be attributed the fact that the Ceylon' fishery is productive only at intervals of several years. Par. 3 . Shallow and accessible bods can easily be overfished. (Shoso in Ceylon are neither shallow nor accessible). I believe that the natural population of the shallows of Bongonab Bay was replenished by the spat from the deeper water, without which they would have been permanent?.';* denuded. Apart from this the shells from deeper water were of little value, being stunted and heavily parasitised. I made calculations which showed that the impositio of a very moderate size limit in the fed Sea would increase the value of the native fishery by about 3Cy. Ike Arabs and Bisharin were taking the smallest shells seen, the vclue of which was almost nothing, and they probably do the sane in the Iranian Gulf. Owing to the number of Governments concerned it was impossible to impose even this simp 1 e r egu 1 atio n.

The Trustees are advised that research on the pearl fisheries of Ceylon have demonstrated that - (1) the pearl banks all lie at depths between 5 and 12 fathoms. 1 (2) the pearl oyster begins to reproduce at the age of 12 months and produces large numbers of veligers twice a year; (3) pearls are usually produced by oysters between the ages of 22 and 4 years; (4) owing to the set of the currents the fry is frequently carried away from the oyster banks and perishes with the result that only occasionally are there years when the banks are worth fishing; (5) the authorities are of opinion that pearl fishing is likely to result only to a negligible extent in diminishing the fishery in the future. The chief enemies of the pearl oysters are not the pearl fishers, but rays and other fishes and molluscs. It would appear that in the case of the Persian Gulf the conditions under heading ( 4 ) differ from those in Ceylon, but those indicated under the other headings are likely to be similar in both cases. Since the oysters begin to reproduce at least a year before they are fit to fish, the fishing is unlikely to affect the maintenance of the stock unless it is conducted on such lines as to destroy the mature oysters which have not yet begun to produce pearls. There is no reason to suppose that a deep-sea pearl fishery could profitably be established, but the opinion of those who have been consulted is that if such a fishery were established it would be scarcely likely to affect the oyster population in the shallower beds. The Trustees directed me to transmit the foregoing comments with the reservation that they emanate from men whose knowledge is not derived from actual experience of pearl fishing. The Trustees suggest that if Lord Zetland sees no The Under-Secretary of State, India Office, •.Thitehall, S.W.l.2 . objection it might be well to consult Dr.Cyril Crossland the former Director of the Egyptian Zoological Service who is an expert on such matters with first-hand experience of pearl fishing in the Red Sea.

Adrian-Vallatice has suggested that you may be able to assist in a problem which is at present under investigation. It is a question whether use could be made oi shark-skin in lieu of leather for certain purposes as a War measure. Arrangements have been mace for experi mental tanning; but it is necessary first to know' precisely the species of shark which is chiefly found in the Persian Gulf. Can you give any in formation on tnis point ? d/- Kajor, Secretary, Supply Development Committee.1 u GOVERNMEMT OF IMDIA, .

Much of the correspondence speculates on the extent of Persia's interest in the pearl fisheries that are not within their own territorial waters, including not only those identified by the British as being Arab fisheries but also the following recently identified fisheries: shallow beds outside territorial waters that have not been worked by Arab pearl divers, and deep beds outside territorial waters that have not been exploited by Arab divers and in fact cannot be exploited without mechanical equipment.The file contains copies of correspondence between the Admiralty, the India Office, and the Foreign Office, which discusses how best to protect the deep water beds from foreign exploitation (i.e. by Persian, Japanese, or other foreign parties), in light of the fact that the Arab rulers have no valid claim to exclusive fishing rights.In addition, the file includes correspondence on the following: an expedition to the Iranian side of the Gulf by a Danish citizen named Dr Harald Blegvad, Director of the Danish Biological Station, who has been engaged by the Iranian Government to investigate the waters of the Gulf, with particular reference to fishing; the potential impact that deep-sea operations might have on fishing in shallow pearl beds.Correspondents include the following: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Political Agent, Kuwait; the British Minister, Tehran; the India Office; the Foreign Office; the Admiralty; the Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir as Sabah [Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ]; the Director of the British Museum (Natural History), Clive Forster-Cooper; Dr Cyril Crossland, zoologist at the University of Copenhagen's Zoological Museum.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Admiralty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of the Danish Biological Station</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of the Natural History Museum</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Cyril Crossland</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Territorial waters</topic></subject><subject><topic>Pearl fisheries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Marine biology</topic></subject><subject><topic>Fishing rights</topic></subject><subject><topic>Zoology</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000a3#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
