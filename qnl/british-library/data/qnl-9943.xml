From Lieutenant Colonel LEWIS PELLY, H. B. M.'s Political Resident Persian Gulf. To CHARLES GONNE, Esquire, Acting Secretary to Government, Political Department, Bombay. Residency 31s/ 1864. Sir ,—In continuation of ray letter as per margin, I have the honour to report that „ . , . I landed at Bunder Abbass on the 23rd ultimo, and No. 65 of 18th ultimo. moved through Minow to Cape Jashk, in view to ex amining what facilities the nature of this shore line and the temper of its inhabitants might afford for the proposed extension of our Telegraphic operations. 2. A sketch map* accompanies this letter showing my line of route. The sketch makes no pretensions to scientific accuracy. The distances have been cal culated from the time actually employed in marching, collated with estimates given of the same distances by the natives of the country. Lieutenant Dawes, of H. M.'s Residency Steamer ' Berenice has obligingly protracted these distances for me, and it is an independent proof of their general accuracy, that some of the rivers passed en route were found to coincide with the lines given in the Chart as ♦ the mouths of those rivers. ' 3. As this route has never before been traversed I believe by a European, I venture to hope that the information in regard to the names and sources of rivers, and in regard to the general aspect of the country, may not be altogether without geographical interest. 4. Enclosed is a report, transmitted in original, containing some interesting physical information, obligingly prepared by Dr, Colvill, Civil Surgeon to the Residency, at my request. 5. I have further the honour to append some miscellaneous information collected during the march, as follows ; — Itinerary of Route from Bunder Abbass to Cape Jashk. The Rou tes from Bunder Abbass to Minow Fort. Approximate estimate of the Revenue and Population of the District of Minow, including Karoon and Talany. Names of the environs of the Minow District. . The Routes from Minow to Roodbar. * Protracted on a large scale, in anticipation of its being hereafter filled in by Telegraphic travellers. 1 A2 The Stages from Minow to Roodan and Roodbar. o The Stages from Minow to Kerman through Rood an and Roodbar c o The Route from Bunder Abbass to Lar. The Route from Bunder Abbass to Kernian. 6. The route between Bumler Abbass and Cape Jashk may be apportioned— t First. —Into that from Bunder Abbass to Minow, lying nearly due East. Second. — Into the district of iVlinow itself, stretching round the North-east angle of the Gulf of Omman ; and Thirdly. —Into the district known as Biyaban, reaching from the Southern boundary of Minow to a point a little to the Eastward of Cape Jashk, and having a general direction of about South South-east. 7. Bunder Abbass and its adjacent shore line to Khameer on the West and to the Minow district on the East, is under a local Arab Governor directly subordinate to the Sultan of Muscat. That portion of this shore line which lies between Bunder Abbass and Minow is a plain, having an average width of from four to five fursacks, bounded on the South by the sea and on the North by the mountain ranges, through which lead up the caravan routes to Lar, Ytrzd, and Kerman. The plain itself may be generally described as arid, saline, and occasional ly flooded, and rendered impassable for camels after the infrequent showers which full here during the winter season. It is skirted on the North by date groves, and dotted at wide intervals with small plantations and temporary huts at such points as sweet water may be findable. 4 r *J 8. The length of the plain from Bunder Abbass to Minow Fort is about twelve fursacks in a direct line. This length is traversed by five paths, of which the Northsrumost, known as the Shernil route, clings to the lower spurs of the hills, and throws off as branches the caravan routes leading up into the interior. The o-eneral direction of this Northern route is first from Bunder Abbass to the hills in a North-easterly direction, then Easterly along the hills, and finally South-east into Minow. Its total length may be twenty fursacks or so. The second path, known as Dehnow, runs pretty nearly parallel with the first, and at an average distance ofa fursack to the Southward. Its total length may be eighteen fursacks or so. A third path, called Delgah or Khoshamedy, runs similarly at a distance of a fursack or so. ] he fourth path, known as Burkah, being that which I followed, is shorter than ti.'ose to its Northward, and is the most convenient for halts. It runs in a general direction of East, at an average distance of a fursack from the sea-shore. The total length of the line to Fort Minow is between thirteen and fourteen fursacks. The fifth route follows the shore line as closely as the Khor-e-Tauzbar. Tashtaieez. character of the country will allow. This shore line is indented by three creeks as per margin. This would be i the most direct route, but owing to the marshy neighbourhood of the creeks, it is impassable, unless for footmen. \3 9. The plain is very thinly peopled, and these few seem quiet and well disposed Perhaps the neighbourhood of the route that I followed may possess some advan tages over others for a Telegraphic line— Firstly. — Because, if I am rightly informed, the influence of the sea air is injurious to the wire to a distance inland of at least from 3 to 4 miles. Secondly. —Because a line running close by the shore would encounter soft or marshy points, and might be liable to injury from boatmen landing. Thirdly. — Because the route I indicate would have at all events the protection of a few inhabited spots. Fourthly. — Because it is more direct than any route to its Northward ; and— Fifthly. —-Because the nearer you approach to the Northern hills, the more risk you run from the inroad of wandering mountain tribes, and from the mischiev ous propensities of the Cafila men along the main roads into the interior. 10. If protection should be required for this part of tiie route, it could readi- Iv be procured on the spot under authority from the Sultan of Muscat. But I am deferentially of opinion, that in the first instance it might be well for us to assume that special protection by the local Chiefs is not required, and that the Articles of Agreement given by the Sultan are sufficient guarantee. The merchants at Bunder Abbass and at Minow are quite alive to the advantages of Telegraphic communications, as are also the local authorities, whose revenue is dependent on the prosperity of those merchants. Both the one and the other- would, I feel sure, exert all their influence to preserve the line from injury. If after any named period no injury should have occurred, a complimentary present to a local authority would come with good grace and effect, and the gratitude of expectancy would remain unimpaired. Whereas, if we began with miscellaneous present-giving and regular pavments for protection, the former would sooner or later cease and cause discontent; and the latter would be liable to degenerate into a sort of permanent blackmail, which could not afterwards be refused without risk. Of course we should pay such men as we might ourselves employ along the line, and it would be foi Go&gt;ernment to determine whether it might not be both equitable and politic for them to accord to the Sultan of Muscat some acknowledgment for the use of His Highness' territory for Telegraphic purposes. 11. The second portion of the route comprises the district of Minow* It is * The district of Minow has been known frem antiquity as sn oasis favoured by nature beyond any other spot perhaps in all the desolate regions stretching from Kurrachee to Bushire. It may have been at one of the sea creeks piercing this district that the conference was held on board Nearchus' fleet to deliberate on the comparative difficulties of following the Persian or Arabian coasts of the Persian Gult, and on the practicability of communicating with the army returning from Kerman. The Arabian hills of Omman near Cape Mussendom are visible from Mmow. Minow is said to mean in old Persian sweet water par excellence ; in modern Persian Minow would mean garden land situate by running water. And in Arabic it would mean flowing, from the root ' Mana/' to flow.subordinate to Bunder Abbass, and is at present ruled by the son of the Governor of that port. It may be roughly described as a triangle, having for its shortest side a line drawn four or five fursacks inland from the Mi now Creek to a point to the North and Westward of the Fort of Minow, and having for its other two sides lines drawn respectively along the coast and along the base of the Beshankard hills intersecting at Ziarat. This area, so far South as the Joo-Mohalla river, contains successive belts of date grove interspersed with corn fields and waste patches. And as you approach the river line, considerable gardens bearing Orange, Mango, Citron, Plantain, and other fruit trees. To the Southward of that line the district becomes less cultivated until you reach Kohistak,* where the road touches the sea shore, and is skirted on the left by extensive date groves. Kohistak itself is an average vil lage with some slight fort works on the crest of a scarped rock, whence, however, a commanding viewf would be obtainable in all directions for Telegraph purposes. From Kohistak to the Southern point of the Minow district at Ziarat the road lies along the sea shore. The plain is broken up or changes into sand hills, until at Ziarat these come close down to the sea side. 12. The source of the Minow district's fertility is the river bearing its name. This river enters the district from a North-easterly 'direction down a ravine imme- t/ diately below the Fort of Minow, which crests the last spur of a steep and earthy range of hills. At its lowest season the river at this point may be fifty or sixty feet wide by a foot or so deep. Immediately on entering the plain, much of the water is diverted for the purpose of cultivation, and as the bed winds round a small and low promontory on which the town of Minow is situate close to the fort, it widens to a mile or so in breadth, and the water is lost in sand. It re-appears, however, some two or so fursacks down, and reaches the sea near the Creek of Minow, distant about four fursacks from the Minow Fort. 13. The Minow river bears this name for a distance of some four fursacks into the hill country to a place named Gazoo. At Gazoo, called also Dorood Gah (or the point where two rivers meet), the main stream is joined by a tributary called •/ Geghem, coming from Rood bar in an Easterly direction. The mainstream itself here changes its name to Roodoon, after the name of the district through which it passes. The Roodoon in turn is increased along its course by many small * Kohistak, like other villages along this shore line, is mainly dependent on its fish and dates. The fishing boat here in use, as likewise on the Omman coast, is made of date leaf stalks. A hole of the size of the craft to be built is dug in the sand. The stalks of the date are clipped thin at either extremity, and are then bound together in curved form by cord, the extremity so bound forming stem and stern. The keel is rounded, and the water flows freely in and out between the date stalks. About a foot and a half above the keel, a date stalk platform or deck is rigged, upon which the fisherman sits, flinging his fish down a small hatchway into the water in the hold. The mast is sometimes formed of two slight sticks spring ing from either side of the craft at a point where bent and strongest date stalks are carved to form ribs strengthening the sides of the boat. f A similar eminence overlooks the Joo-Mohalla river close to the road.tributaries. I illustrate this paragraph in a foot-note,* showing roughly the manner in which the Minow river reaches the plain. 14. The caravan route to Roodbar, whence Minow draws her wool and ' Rowghun,' follows the course of the Minow river, which it crosses seven times before reaching Roodoon. 15. The side which forms the sea face of the Minow triangle is pierced by five sea creeks, viz, that known as Minow Creek running up to within a fursack of Ilajce Abad, the first considerable village which meets you on arriving in the Minow district from Bunder Abbas. The Minow Creek may be upwards of a fursack in length, having at high tide a fathom of water on its bar, ten fathoms along its mid-channel, and a fathom at its head where the boats unload. The second, third, and fourth creeks are smaller in dimensions, and may be distant a fursack or so one from the other. They are known as Khor-e-Borjee, Khor-e-Bhakha, and Khor-e-Kurgom. There are more than one depressions across the plain to Khor-e- Minow and Khor-e-Borjee, forming either the present or past beds of the Minow river. The fifth and Southernmost sea creek is that of Kohistak. It may be as mile or so in length, with from one to two fathoms along its channel at high tide. The Minow and Kohistak Creeks are said to be those most frequented by native craft. 16. Though of a mixed race, the natives of Minow called themselves Minowees, and seem to keep themselves much apart. They are industrious and peaceful. Some few years ago their plain was subject to raids from the hillsmen of the North east, Latterly, however, all has remained quiet. They appear contented under the rule of Muscat. But when, some eight or nine years back, the district fell tempora rily under the direct management of Persia, the Minowees fled to Kishm, Hormuz, and other islands.

Considered for Telegraphic purposes, I think that the remarks which I have submitted above, in regard to the route between Minow and Bunder Abbass apply also in some degree to the district of Minow itself. Perhaps, ho wever, this district is more subjected to floods and swamps after rain. But the rain-fall in these regions is evidently so scant, that it is questionable if it will be taken much into account in either case, unless at the points where the beds of rivers cross the plain.* The heart of Minow district has manifestly been strongly flooded.f Yet, so far as I can ascertain, little rain has fallen here during the past three years, 18. Perhaps if the lelegraphic wire were to enter the district of Minow near Hajee Abad, it might then follow the cultivated land, and so leaving Kurgom to the right, come down towards the sea shore in the neighbourhood of Kohistak. 19. From Ziarat to JasliK, the plains lying between the mountains of Beshan- kard and the sea, is known as Bujaban.'| It is crossed by nine rivers coming down tiie hill countiy of Beshankard, None of these rivers How in continuous streams throughout the year. Some, however, have large pools of water along their beds, even at their lowest season, and all of them become impassable torrents after rain in the upper country. 20. After leaving Ziarat, the road turns a little inland through sand hills to the fort of Growg, whence it leads on to Seereek, the principal fort and village of the district; the intermediate ground being well sprinkled with date groves and cultivation. From Seereek the road continues over a dead level at an average dis tance of nearly a fursack from the sea line down to Brisk, where it turns South east and loses sight of the sea by passing behind some sandstone cliffs. From Gown the load leads for a couple of miles up the bed of the Tangalee river, then gi a dually ascends over a plateau, and thence gently descends to Sheeranhan. Tiiis stage is in fact the only one that can be called otherwise than level throughout the whole march, for even the valleys between the hills are nothing more than a portion of the sea board plain, separated from it by intermediate lengths of a plain, It so clianceu that heavy raia commenced to fall while I was passing the shore line. The whole plain assumed the appearance oi a lake in half an hour or so. Every hollow at once became filled from the Beshankard mountains. The rivers and nullahs became torrents six and eight feet deep, and, in fact, the entire plain wore the appearance of a flood of water poured down from the Beshankard hills, across a level of two or three fursacks into the ocean. ffiadition asserts that the Minow Creek once pierced a fursack inland further than it does at present. I found the marks of extensive ruins, called Chelow (or forty streams), at the asserted head of the old creek. There is no doubt of the trace of a broad water course, but whether it formed an old bed of the river, or is a depression from which the sea has retired, I am unable to sav. J Bujaban literally means waste, tins name having been given probably at the time when it was first appropriated by the Beloochees.7 having been forced out by subterraneous action from the Eastward, thus forming lines of sandstone cliffs scarped to the Eastward, and sloping into the plain towards the sea. After Sheeranhan the road debouches a^ain on the sea board at Gang*awn. and thence skirting the hills in an Easterly direction, reaches the fort of Jashk, situate among sand hills and distant about two miles from the shore line. 21. It would have been possible, after leaving Gown, to have returned to the plain, and to have followed a route leading by Gattan and Koh-e-Moobarek, and so round by the shore line to Gangawn. This route however would have been longer. 22. The district of Bujaban, like that of Minow, is subject to the Sultan of Muscat. Its inhabitants are Beloochees said to have descended into the plain upwards of a hundred years ago from the hill country of Beshakard. The local Governor is a Belooch, who resides at Seereek. The villages along the district are more numerous, and the date groves and cultivation more extensive, than I had expected to find them. By a village, however, should be understood, as is usual in Central Asia, a graveyard with some temporary huts about it. This district, as its Chief told me, had never before been visited by any stranger, whether European or Asiatic. The people are therefore more shy than they otherwise would be. Still I do not apprehend that any difficulty would be experienced in carrying a Telegraphic wire along the route I came. Those in chai ■ge of the operation would naturally be careful to gain the confidence of the natives, and attract labour by regular just payments and by mild treatment. After abundant rain and corresponding harvest, provisions would be sufficiently abundant; but in ordinary times grain and straw are very scarce, drinking water equally so, and even mutton and goats' meat not always readily obtainable. 23. I estimate the distance from Bunder Abbass through Fort Minow to Cape Jashk at a little under three hundred miles. My followers and baggage moved on camels, which we changed as opportunity and need rendered expedient. The march from Minow to Jashk being perhaps two hundred and thirty miles or so, was performed in eight successive days' marching, and that from Bunder Abuass to the Minow district in a little over 24 hours. 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, LEWIS FELLY, Lieutenant Colonel, II. B. M.'s Political Resident, Persian Gulf.8 To Lieutenant Colonel LEWIS PELLY, Resident and Consul General, Bushire. Bus hire, 1865. Sir ,—In submitting, in obedience to your orders, a concise report of our late tour, I trust, should it be considered very meagre, some allowance will be made for the nature of the country travelled over, the season of the year, and the rapidity of marching, which prevented me from entering into any detail on the subjects mentioned in your letter. The rocks forming the creeks and inlets of Muscat are apparently of volcanic origin and of a black or blackish green, about 300 feet high, without any stratifica tion, and interspersed with numerous veins of quartz. This formation extends iilaud about three miles, and at Al-Vothayeh it is overlaid by another of a greenish colour, and as far as could be seen without any distinct stratification, (Muscat No. 1, Al-Vothayeh No. 2,) and this again is soon overlaid by strata of coarse grained red sandstone, which may be traced for a considerable distance up the coast. (Al- Vothayeh No. 3.) But at Mussendom the rocks are limestone in strata, from two to eight feet thick, contorted in almost every imaginable shape, and varying considerably in colour. (Mussendom Nos. 4, 5, and 6.) North-west from Mussendom, on the Persian side of the gulf, is the island of Angaum. It is five miles long by two and a half broad, and is closely analogous with the neighbouring portion of the island of Kishm, with this exception, that over the corresponding strata (Angaum Nos. 7, 8, and 9 are corresponding strata from below upwards) there is a layer about six feet thick of coral, fragments of coral and shells loosely agglutinated by sand, and over that a thin skin of sandstone of the same kind and placed much in the same manner as on parts of the Peninsula of Bushire, where a thin layer overlies a soil which, when uncovered, is at once fit for culiivation (Angaum Nos. 10 and 11). From Bunder Abbass to Cape Jashk our road lay along a low plain, averaging ten miles in breadth, and bounded on the one hand by mountain ranges, and on the other by the sea shore. This plain is clearly divisible into three parts : an inner third, the soil of which is of the same nature as, and appears to have been formed from the disintegration of, sandstone rocks and from silt deposited from innumerable mountain streams ; an outer third, barren and in many places marshy and encrusted by salt, appears to have been formed by the sea; while the interme diate portion is in a transition state, too barren and salt to rear cereals or even support the date, but containing sufficient nourishment for the tamarisk, dwarf tamarind, and camel thorn. At Gerony and Seereek, where the sand is blown intohills, it is bound together by the Ammophila Bounding this plain na the inner side are hills of loose-grained light-coloured sandstone, and each range appears to rise higher than the one in front, till the horizon is bounded by mountains or numulitic limestone. This is the same arrangement that is to be found almost all along the Persian side ol this gulf. Nos. 12, 13, and 14 are specimens of the sandstone strata from near Khoestack, taken from above down. And Nos. 15 and 16 from near the village of Asherai, also from above down. No. 17 is from the bed of the Minow river. from the rapidity of (ravelling it was impossible to form more than a rude guess at the temperature of these regions during the month of December. The following is the average of the observations taken:— 8 A . M . 10 A. M. 12 Noon. 2 P. M. 4 P. M. Sunset. 8 P. M. 74° 0 01 GO 92° 93° 0 0 01 CO 0 -J o o Although the people on this coast are stunted and badly formed, with very dark complexions, low broad foreheads, large noses, prominent eye-brows, and drooping eyelids, with peering eyes, apparently from the constant glare, still thev seem much more free from disease than in most parts of Persia. Variola, it is true, was raging at Minow, but that was unusual. There is on the promontory of Bushire a stratum of sandstone evidently analogous with a corresponding one at Dalakhi. This stratum at Dalakhi, with numerous other sandstones, overlies the mountain limestone. Specimens of all those rocks I had the honour of forwarding to you after our journey to Shiraz, and i now take the liberty, as it is connected with the subject matter of this letter, of sending some fossils extracted from the stratum near Bushire. They consist of remains of Fad, Amorphozoa, Anthozoa, Bnjozoa, Echimidea, Annulata, Brachiopoda, Scunellibranchiata, Gasteropoda, and Cephalopoda. As yet I have been unable to find traces of either Crustacea or Vertebrata. While on the limestone range of Gheeseckhoon a short time ago, 1 collected three specimens of gums, with the trees producing them. One is, of course, one of the trees producing Gum Arabic, but as the other two are unknown to me, and not exported, perhaps you may deem them of some interest; I therefore take the liberty of sending them all with the following description. What is called Badam by the Eliants of Gheeseckhoon, is a shrub, sometimes growing into a small tree, and very much like a large broom {Cytisus Scop arms). The gum called Zaede exudes in abundance, but from the older and blackened stems only ; there is little or none on the green. It is generally in rounded lumps, some as large as a small orange, crisp on the outer surface, but soft inside. It10 contracts and hardens after being gathered. About 30 tons of this gum are collected principally by children from the whole of Gheeseckhoon in the year. It is sent to a village in the plain, where it is sold for 3 shillings a cvvt., and from there it is sent 30 miles further to Bushire, and sold for 15 shillings a cwt. This tree is not confined to Gheeseckhoon, but is to be met with on all the limestone ranges up to Kazeroon, where it meets the dwarf oak and ceases. The fruit is called Baclam or the Almond. Benak is an elegant little tree, growing sparingly on these hills, and looks something like our rowan {Pyrus ancupa It seems to be of the order -•4 nciccivdtciccfE. Some of these trees, depending* apparently upon position, are dripping with clear gum from every part, leaves, stem, and all. From others again very little gum exudes. The gum is called Beneeza, and falls to the ground in clear colourless drops, about the consistency of thick syrup. Persian women chew it, and in Baghdad it is used in dvein*'-. ^ *j ^2 Jimeel is a low thorny shrub, about one and a half or two feet high, somethino- of the appearance of an old furze (Ulex Europceus) which has been often cut down and then dried. The gum exudes from the older part of this stem. This o-um, called Ginja, is a hard, yellow, crystalline looking substance. It is used by the natives for ophthalmia, and is pounded and placed over wounds. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient Servant, W. H.
