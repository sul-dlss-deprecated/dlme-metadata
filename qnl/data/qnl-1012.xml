The correspondence discusses changes in legislation proposed by the Government of Iraq regarding the collection of land rent and land produce duties, and the impact of these changes to the ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ.In particular, the correspondence concerns the Government of Iraq's decision to end the immunity from taxation (on the gardens) that had been granted to the former ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Mubārak Āl Ṣabāḥ and the Shaikh of Mohamerrah, Khaz‘al bin Jābir al-Ka‘bī by the British Government in return for their military support against the Ottoman Empire in World War 1. The correspondence also discusses in detail a court case in the Iraqi courts regarding the land owned by Shaikh Aḥmad and the Al Sabah family.The correspondence discusses attacks on Shaikh Aḥmad's fellaheen (agricultural workers) in Iraq by other fellaheen on the land and contains a translation of a letter outlining the details of these attacks sent from Shaikh Aḥmad to the British Political Agent in Kuwait, Harold Richard Patrick Dickson (folio 32).A complete list of the date garden properties in Iraq which were in possession of Shaikh Mubārak in 1914 (and included in the British Government's pledge of that year) is contained in the file on folios 161-171.The file also contains correspondence regarding whether or not Shaikh Aḥmad should attend the trial in Iraq in person, concerns about his growing frustration with the British Government's perceived inability to resolve the dispute and his belief that they were siding with the Iraqi government against him.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Land ownership</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001d0#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001d0#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
