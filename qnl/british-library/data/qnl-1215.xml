Christian’s letter relates to the status of Mombas [Mombasa] on the East African coast, which was made a British Protectorate in February 1824 in response to the capture of nearby Pemba Island by the Imam of Muscat. Christian writes that, in light of the British Government’s disapproval of the measures taken by Captain Owen in making Mombasa a Protectorate, he encloses a letter (folios 7-11) sent by himself to John Wilson Croker, Secretary to the Admiralty, dated 9 May 1826. In this letter, Christian acknowledges the British Government’s disapproval of the making of a Protectorate of Mombasa, and sets out his proposals for British withdrawal from the town. Christian discusses the likely effects of withdrawal, including the extent to which the town’s inhabitants will be at the mercy of the Imam of Muscat, and the impact British withdrawal will have on the slave trade in the region.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673717.0x000004#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
