Dear Sir, I am attaching a Private &amp; Confidential letter of 24th April, 1942 received hy The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited from the Eastern Bank Limited. This letter was received following our conversation of 24th April and I believe will serve to answer your question as to whether the transfer rate for notes was equivalent to that charged for specie. In connection with the general subject of banking matters, I would appreciate it if you could give me what information you can in regard to the following questions :- (1) - Does the Eastern Bank Limited hold exclusive banking privileges in Bahrein and if so what phases of banking are included? (2) - 'What banking laws, regulations, etc., govern the operations of the Eastern Bank Limited, particularly as regards fixing rates and similar matters? (3) - How and by whom are the insurance rates mentioned in the attached letter arrived at? | Ss The Company feels itself at a disadvantage due to the lack of information on these matters and any information which you can furnish would enable the Company to approach their banking problems more intelligently. Your Anderson. Chief Local Representative THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED. if si Enc: WBBsemm**THE EASTERN BANK LIMITED. BAHRAIN, 23rd April 1942. PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL . Messrs. Bahrain Petroleum Company Ltd., Awali. Dear Sirs, Further to our Private and Confidential letter of the 20th of April, we have to advise that insurance rates on specie and notes from India to Bahrain will be £ 9.15*0 and £ 9.18.9 per cent respectively as from the 20th of April, 1942. « We have therefore increased our rate to 8-^% in our favour for all future remittances. Yours faithfully, 3d. M. Gunn. Manager.Confidential, No.C/551 . Political Agency, Bahrain, the 28th April 1942. To The Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, Awali. Banking . Dear Sir, , ^ , I return herewith the enclosure to your letter ^ p u * No.PA-131 dated 27th April 1942. 2. The answers to the questions you have asked are as follows s- (i) The Eastern Bank Limited does not hold exclusive banking privileges in Bahrain. (ii) The Eastern Bank Limited conduct their banking operations in the same way as other British owned Banks with branches in the East. The local Manager himself fixes the rate for remittances. This rate is largely determined by two factors (a) the cost to the Bank of importing notes and specie, and (b) the cost to the Bank of purchasing notes and specie locally. ^Vhen the local supply of currency is plenti ful the Bank need not import notes or specie and can purchase its requirements locally at a cheap rate. In such circum stances the Bank rate for remittances is very low. Contrari wise, when notes or specie are locally in short supply, the Bank will either purchase locally at a premium or import from India, whichever alternative is cheaper. In either case the Bank rate has to be fixed at a high level to enable the Bank to cover its expenses and make a reasonable profit. (iii) Insurance rates to cover specie and notes in transit between India and Bahrain are fixed by underwriters in London. The rate varies from time to time according to the element of risk which the underwriters believe to be in volvedAt present the cost to the Bank of bringing specie from India is approximately 11^5 made up as follows Allowing as profit the Bank would be compelled, if all your Company 1 s requisitions in specie were met by import from India, to charge a rate of 12% on remittances. In fact, however, the Bank rate on such remittances has been fixed at &amp;£%, a rate sufficient to allow the Bank a fair profit after claculations have been made as to the amount of specie which has to be imported from India, the amount which can be purchased locally (and the price at which such local purchases can be made), and the amount which is available from current cash resources. 3. If your Company is not satisfied with the rates charged by the Eastern Bank, I suggest that you should discuSvS the situation with the Manager. Obviously a very much lower rate for remittances would be possible if in surance charges were eliminated i.e. if the Company were willing to have money transported from India at their own risk. Possibly, also, if notes were brought by Air Mail instead of by sea, insurance would be less. 4. In regard to the general situation, there is al ways a shortage of rupees in Bahrain and other pearling ports at the beginning of the summer. The position this year has been made even more difficult by the fact that exports of silver, up to the end of March, were very heavy. Since the end of March exports of silver have been strictly controlled, and this factor should (unless substantial hoarding takes place as a result of nervousness in regard Insuranc e Freight Packing 9 |» 1 % to the war) make the cash position easier from now on wards. When the pearling fleets return in the autumn . / there&lt;s&gt; l there should again be a plentiful supply of silver locally. 5. I have, finally, one suggestion to make which may be of help. It is that, before paying the next instalment of Royalty to the Bahrain Government, you should first in quire from the Mviser, through me, whether they desire the whole amount to be paid in Bahrain. It is not improbable that the Bahrain Government would like a substantial portion of the Royalty paid to them in India, in which case you would be saved a considerable sum on account of the cost of remit tance.

Wakefield, Esq., His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrein. Dear Sir, BANKING Please refer to your confidential letter C/551 of April 28th, 1942, in answer to our letter PA-131 on the subject of banking. The company is most grateful for the information furnished in your reply which affords the company a much clearer understanding of the banking situation in Bahrein than it has had until now. The company is very pleased to learn that measures have been instituted to control the export of silver from Bahrein and hopes that this control will do much to reduce the amount of money that must be imported. The company will take advantage of the kind suggestion in paragraph five of your letter and will consult with the Adviser regarding the amount of royalty money the Bahrein Government would be agreeable to being paid in India.

BAHKIKG- His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, BAHREIN. Bear Sir, ' Please refer to your confidential letter No. C/551 dated 28th April, 1942 on the subject of banking. The Company would appreciate your advice on the following questions (1) Is there any legal objection to the Company making its own arrangements for transportation of specie and notes from India to Bahrein? (2) Is there any legal objection to the Company purchasing specie and notes in the open market in Bahrein, giving in exchange by mutual agreement with the seller, cheques on the Company’s account in India? If there is no objection, the Company request permission to do so on the understanding that funds so obtained would be used only for the purpose of satisfying the Company's current needs. The Company gives its assurance that if the reply to the first question is favourable and it is desired to take advantage of the same, they will approach and obtain the sanction of the proper authorities in India before proceeding further. It would, of course, not be desirable to do so if equally satisfactory arrangements could be made with the Eastern Bank Limited. i sh W. P. Anderson. Chief Local Bepresentative.

No permission to this effect is required. 4. I note that, before the Company makes arrangements to bring specie and notes from India to Bahrain, the sanction of the appropriate authorities in India will be obtained.

This information is being conveyed to the Treasurer and Comptroller of the Company, who may consider the possibility of making arrangements for the transporation of the Company’s requirements of specie and notes from India to Bahrein. The Company would be reluctant to enter upon such an undertaking and would only do so in the interest of economy and if no other satisfactory and equitable means of reducing the burden now borne by the Company could be evolved.

Political Agency, Bahrain, the 15th May 1942* To The Hon* ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire* Memorandum, On the 24th April Mr, Anderson, Chief Local Representative, Bahrain Petroleum Company, complained to me that his Company were being unfairly treated in that they were required to pay heavy commission on all their requirements of rupees and notes obtained from the local branch of the Eastern Bank, Limited, He said that the Company* s requirements amounted to some 80 or 90 lakhs of rupees per annum and that all this money, which was obtained from the Eastern Bank, was charged with commission as though it had been brought from India, What actually happened, he said, was that money which the Company obtained from the Bank was paid out in salaries, royalties etc. and was put into circulation in Bahrain, A great proportion of that money must return to the Bank and yet, Mr. Adnerson complained, the Bank did not allow the Company the re-use of this money free of charge but claimed commission as though all the Company* s demands were met by requisitions from India. 2. It. Anderson said that he thought it was the function of a Government or Administration to supply coin and notes of the realm, and he did not see why his Company should perform this function on behalf of the local Govern ment. 3. Finally he wanted to know whether, in order to avoid payment of large sums to the Bank as commission, / therethere was any objection to the Company taking money from local merchants, and, in return, affording them credits in India. 4. I told Mr. Anderson that I would look into the matter but, before taking any steps I should like to know what commission was charged by the Bank on remittances of (a) currency notes and (b) specie. 5.
