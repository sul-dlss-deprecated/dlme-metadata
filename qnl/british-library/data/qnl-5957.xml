It would appear that it would be more satisfactory if the cars were purchased in BAGHDAD and the Guns fitted by us as arranged with the Shaikh at the Conference held at KUWAIT on 23rd June. Is His Excellency is no doubt aware, Sir Robert Brooke Pophua was anxious that a condition of supplying Guns should be that the Shaikh should send a few men for training by the loyal Air Force free of charge. Although this condition was not agreed to at the conference on 23rd June, I am of the opinion that it should be strongly pressed for. X consider it most unlikely that there are any men in the Shaikh's Entourage who sufficiently understand the mechanicism of a Lewis Gun to correct any failures that may take take place.

The latest ne?/s about the raid by MUTRIGA(Mutair) on the Shammari grazing party near RAUDHATAIN on 29th July, is that the Police at Safwan gave chase, found the Shammari shepherds, followed up the raiders, and caught them up somewhere near AR-RIQAAI,(the easternmost point of the AT-TAWAL). The raiders apparently abandoned the loot, six of their own camels, and dropped two rifles in their hurry to get away, which they did successfully l I .^hink it is a great pit&amp;, if the above version of the story is correct, that the Police did not give chase, as these raiders have never been properly dealt with, and this seems to have been a golden opportunity, as I believe the Police had about four Lewis guns with them, mounted on cars I The raiders were evidently some of Ibn Su'ud's loyal tribesl The rebels* raiding party, said to be under the leader ship of AZAIYIZ AD-DAWISH, are reported to have reached JARIYAT al * ILYA, and to be making for QAIYA.

Safwan, dated the 5£h August, 1929. To:- The Adviser, { Ministry of Interior, 1 { Baghdad. The Inspec tor-General | of Police, | Memorandum . Sub ject:- Mutair Raid on Shammar Thimya t. At midday on 29-7-29, a party of Mutair, ^8 strong, under the leadership of one, Baddah al liutraciQa, arove off some 200 camels belonging to the Shammar Thimyat (Iraq) which were grazing between Kodhatain and Abatah (Kuwait territory, 35 miles south Safwan), News was brought to Safv/an police post early the following day by one of the owners who stated that the raiders were last seen proceeding in a south westerly direction. The Inspector thereupon set out with 2 light armed cars taking a route down Al Batin via Adhaibah and Khumdf. As nothing was seen, he moved further south in the direction of Al Raqai and at 6 p.m. , when a few miles short of this place, the police sighted the raiaers who immediately opened fire at long range. when the cars approached closer, however, the Mutair abandoned their loot and fled, subsequently taking up a position in some sand hills where the police could not follow. The machine gun creve engaged the raiders at intervals xor about an hour and in the meantime the ov/ner assisted by 2 constables rounded up the camels and drove them oif. At nightfall the cars withdrew, as the raiders had made their way1 2 - yv T) way into impassable country and the recovered camels v/ere well on their way under their small escort. By the end of the action 3 Mutair were wounded and several of their camels killed (this is confirmed). Great difficulty was experienced in getting the police cars hack to Safv/an as springs had been broken in manoevring over most difficult country, and besides tyre trouble they were several times stuck in the sand ~ once for 4 hours. They reached Safwan on the 31-7-29, and had immediately to be put under repair. The matter of relieving the camel escort was urgent, and in consequence arrangements were made with Basrah police for the despatch of two taxis which on arrival (the morning of 1st instant) were loaded v/ith police also food and water and sent out. The police cars were repaired and also followed the same evening. Both parties went as far as A1 Haqai and subsequently the taxis picked up the owner and one of the policeman who were found separated from the remaining constable Attaiyah. Many of the camels had strayed which necessitated an exhaustive search before 170 were eventually collected and brought safely to Safwan. It appears that constable Attaiyah had left the main party to follov/ some 30 camels which, had stampeded in a westerly direction. A continuous search has been made upto the time of writing, but no trace whatever can be found of him or the camel he was riding. Of the 30 which he went to collect, 15 were found near Adhaibah dead from thirst and the remainder straying in that vicinity. Camel patrols from Busaiyah are making enquiries in that\ - 3 - v^&gt; that area and it is still hoped that the missing constable will be found alive. Ke is of the Zayyad tribe, born and bred in the desert, and, considering this, it is most unlikely that he would lose his way. One can only presume that his camel died or became disabled and that he is either with a nomad encampment unable to return or met his death from thirst. Recommendations have been made by the Commandant of Police for rewards to be given to certain car personnel who distinguished themselves in this incident. I fully endorse the recommendations made and trust they will receive your approval and support. Sd/- W.G.Buttloph. Inspecting Officer of Police, Southern Pesert.———r HO. OOHFIDEHTIAL . Political Agency, , * i Dated the 10th September 1929 . From Lieutenant-colonel E.R.P.Dichson, C*I«E., Political Agent, Kuwait, To The Hon 1 tie the political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bush!re. Ammunition tor Shaikh of Kuwait, Sir, to &lt; u ^ I have the honour to refer you to my telegram Ho, n / 909 dated JJrd Augast and your telegram Ho,640 dated the 24th August 1929 . with him fully. At his invitation I also went over his armoury and inspected with him his stocks of rifles and reserve ammunition. It is as well that I did so, for the Shaikh apparently had every intention of following Up his request for 100,000 rounds of Turkish ammunition, with a further request later on, as he put it to me himself, he was anxious not to ask for his full require- jj menta all at once, lest Government should possibly think his demands were excessive. There was also the possibililj he added, of the adherents of Bin Sand, always very active in Kuwait, informing their master that he the Shaikh of Kuwait was purchasing ammunition to send to the Insurgents, and he did not desire such accusation to be put forward on top of all others that Bin Saud had made against him. As a result of my investigations, I found that the Shaikh possesses a good stock of 2. On receipt of your abovementioned reply I went and saw Shaikh Ahmad and discussed the whole questionii l ——jltS—■MKS—fc...... -2- (a) Turkieii Army Mausers. Cb) G-eman Army Mausers. (c) British .JOJ short rifles* about an equal proportion of each* He has practically no ammunition in reserve, and this applies to all three classes. I exclude of course the Lewis gun reserve which he recently received from India* 4* The Shaikh now wishes to buy the following amounts of S*A.A., to bring his reserves up to a decent figure. I put them forward in the form of a consolidated indent* (a) 100,000 rounds H.V. Pointed bullet, to suit the Turkish Army Mauser rifle. % (b) 100,000 -do- -do- to suit the Oerraan Army Mauser rifle. (c) 100,000 -do- -do- to suit British .305 rifles. 5 . The Shaikh has Already enquired from Germany as regards price etc through a certain Herr willnow of Bremen who visited Kuwait sometime back. The latter recently advised him that (b) could be supplied at once, and landed aji Kuwait for 2J &amp; a hundred (fresh and guaranteed stock). The same film said they would quote figures shortly, for numbers required under (a). 6 . If you are able to arrange for the supply of both (a) (b) and (c) through His Majesty's Government, the Shaikh would be very grateful, and would far prefer this arrange ment, as he is anxious above everything to do things above board and always with your and His Majesty*s Government's approval. ?• As regards the bores of (a) and (b). As neither the Shaikh nor I can give these without running the risk of \ making a mistake. I am sending under separate packet two cartridges duly labelled, of the types required. It will be sufficient to say that the smaller of the two is that used by the Turkish regular army now and the larger by the Gorman military forces during tbe war, each being slightly larger than rtkax our own .&gt;05 ammunition.— 1 1 — 'mm— I I »Tn III - 5 - fj 8. I am of opinion we can witjb. perfect safety allow the Shaikh to purchase the above quantity, especially as I believe it is part of our policy to encourage him to put his house in order, and not always feel dependent on us as he has been inclined to do in the past. &gt;00,000 rounds on paper may sound a large amount at first sight but talcing the total number of armed men whom he fceeps up, at 400, this gives us, at 200 rounds per man, 80,000 rounds issued, and only 220,000 in reserve. A mere no thing when compared with the &gt; million rounds which Bin Saud recently purchased from us, also if we consider that little petty actions are of almost monthly occurrence along the frontier. 9. Shaikh Ahmad trusts that you will see your way to support his request, and asks that you enquire tele graphically from His Majesty^ Government London as to whether they can supply (s) and (b) at the figure, or lower than that quoted from Bremen. The only condition that shaikh Ahmad makes is that the ammunition be new of up to date quality, and not old war stock. Should His f Majesty^ Government not be able to 'undertake the supply, | the shaikh trusts you will allow him to make his own arrangements direct. As regards his requirements under (c) he trusts you will be able to arrange the matter | direct with India. It goes without saying that he will purchase all the ammunition he asks for, but he hopes there will not be much delay as he wishes to avoid this. 10. I have written this somewhat lenghhy despatch, rather than telegraph the contents, as I desired to ex plain how it was that whereas my original telegram Ho.909 under reference only made mention of Turkish Mauser am munition, the Shaikh now desires to have both a supply of German as well as British ammunition also.

Your Excellency will note that in the fresh bill submit ted by the R.A.F., the total amount that will be charged now comes to £820-10-8. As is explained in the Chief Staff Officer’s letter, the increase is due to the fact that three trip od mountinRs for each gun has now been included as requested at a cost of £62-6-0. Also they have included the cost of six drums in the price of the three Lewis Guns, which were forgotten in the original bill. Also a small addition to the spares and tools has been added for which a slight extra charge has been made. 3.

The training of the men in question will take place in Basrah near Margil, and the R.A,F. authorities will arrange for accommodation, either tent or building, near to the place where they will receive training; so all that your Excellency’s men will have to do will be to buy their own food and cook it. The period of training will probably last about 3 weeks. For the present nothing need be done by your Excellency until we receive instructions as to the date on which the men are to be sent to Basrah, and the officer to whom they should report.

Subject:- Training of Sheikh of Kuwait r s Men in Lewis Puns. 1 I have received orders from Air Headquarters Hinaidi, to train four of the Sheikh ! s men in the maintenance and use of Lewis Guns, and am instructed to communicate with you for the purpose of making the necessary arrangements. 2. I would like to suggest that these men report here on or about the 15th November, and that if possible they should bring with them one car. Gun and Mounting of the type they use. Should it not. be possible for them to bring their own equipment, I propose to train them on the old type armed Ford, as used by this Unit. 3. I understand that these men will bring their own rations and bedding. I can provide them with either tents or a room in Armoured Cars lines, whichever you recommend. 4. Training will take approximately a fortnight and on completion, a report shewing eaeh man T s proficiency will be rendered to you. 5. Will you please let me know if the date proposed meets with your approval and also let me have any information or suggestions. 6. One difficulty I anticipate is in obtaining an interpreter capable of translating the necessary technical terms. Can you find out if the technical Gunnery terms used by the Sheikhs gun crews are the same as those used in the Iraq Army, or are they accustomed to use English Terms? Possibly they employ no technical language at all! Squadron Leader, Commanding,Armoured Car Reserve, R.A.F. Makinah. Basrah.

With regard to paragraph 2 of the said letter should Your Excellency a&amp;ree to the 15th November being fixed as a suitable date for the training to start, I shall infoum the officer in question that the men will arrive at Basrah and report to him on the 14th or one day previously^ and tha t I will give them a letter which they can take with them* I agree with Your Excellency that to send tham with a Ford Car and Lewis Gun belonging to four Excellency might start unnecessary difficulties, so as decided betweaa us I shall inform the officer that this is impossible. As regards paragraph 3, I propose saying the men will arrange for their own food and bedding but would like iron or wooden beds to sleep on, also that we leave it to the officer in Basrah to give the men tents or a room as he thinks best and in accordance with weather conditions. As regards paragraph 6, I propose replying Ihat they the men should be taught the technical terms used by the Iraq army if possible. If If this is not possible let them be taught the different parts of the Lewis gun in English, and be^ the same Arabic book on the Lewis gun, as is issued to officers and men of the ’Iraq army later when they are about to return to Kuwait.I shall also say that Your Excellency regrets you are unable to supply an interpreter but trust they will be able to arrange for a man in Basrah.

We have established a wireless station for Hickson in Kuwait, v.'hich will quicken up things a but the Shaikh ought really to fit out ray a couple of cars with W/T so that information can be sent in from the frontier at once.

I have now discursed the ir Officer Corrsaai] ding’s letter to you with the hei! h rrho received the suggestion very favourably, and assured me he was himself only too anxious to eventually in crease the number of his armed fords to IB, with 2 cars fitted % with tireless Sets# was als»o favourably impressed with the idea of having an uronean Officer or superior .0.0., to train and command the personnel for a year or so. The 3hei h hot/ever, assured tie that money war his difficulty and that it would be quite impossible for him to raise the wherewithal at present, either to purchase the extra cars, Lewis Chins or wirelaes sets, or pay an Inylishnan to take charge, but in course of tine he hoped to do the needful. limey is of course the difficulty and in the present state of u ait’s finances, I see no hope of the iheirih doing anything in the lines suggested for c.t least a couple of years, or till trade improves, hor the moment 1 think it were best to let the matter lie, unu from time to tine X could « ring up the viatter. Personally I am rather inclined to think the *:&gt;hoiili Is worse off than he cares to admit. Sometime back for instance he told . (+y- cxX [Uzr^P-. t,\V{ me that his date gardens at FAO were bringing in greatly reduced revenues and that whereas in ubaral:*c tims the annual date crop averaged 200,000 ! avoids iIndian), the crop for 1929 was only 40,900 baun&amp;s. lie added that the reducing process had been most marked fron 1924 and onwards* Again recently he nenti red quite casually that his receipts did not balance his expenditure, and that each year now ho had to find the extra money cut of his privy purso. As you doubtless are aware the State of Kuwait is quite primitive still, and is run on regular Bedouin lines; the main principle being that taxation should be as 1 ght as possible and the Customs receipts the chief form of revenue. This latter goes to the Gheilrh, who divides it up among the members of Ms family according to fixed salaries - the balance going to pay for upkeep of his defence force, salaries of staff, etc., etc. I have just finished, with the two days of 1 1d n oalXing ^na such a relief it. is. Apart from the Buler I have had to nalce over 30 calls* These have included calls on the : utasarrif Basrah and staff and the Persian Consul, Basrah, wro have boon down for a h. liday in an unofficial capacity. fours Since-ely, i 1 V- 'ivCONFIBSNTIAL v Political Agent, KOWEIT. \ V) Command Accountant, 'Iraq Command, Royal Air Force, Hinaidi. 19th March, 1930 , CA/Conf/185/6, \w \ With reference to your No *590 of 26th October 1929, I am attaching charges in respect of equipment forwarded to you for the Sheik of Kuweit, and I -shall be glad if you will have a remittance for £855.10.8 forwarded at your earliest convenience. ig Commander, Command Accountant, 'Iraq Command.

Normally, of course, there should be nc objection to your proceeding; as you suggest, but things are not normal. There are two sets of people negotiating with the dheikh for oil concessions: the Eastern and General Syndicate who represent United States oil interests and the Anglo- Persian. The Syndicate gave the Sheikh a large car some time agp and this may be the retort courteous on the other side. There is also the risk of trouble if the Sheikh roes flying into Saudi Arabia and crashes there. (He is no stranger to flying and lately was taken to Baghdad by a Royal Air Force machine and back by a 'Puss Moth'.) So we shall hare to consult the Foreign Office and India Office before we can reply even on a silly point like this. Meanwhile, you might note to delete ’Iraq’ from the address. Basrah is, of course, in Iraq but Kuwait is independent and the Sheikh is very - and rightly - touchy on the subject. If he got a note addressed ’Iraq’ it would not prejudice him in favour of the writer. Yours sincerely, (Sd. JJ.E.lwFlood. (The Honourable C.C. Farrer,Q.B.E*ni P.^. 742(i/33.

You will remember that we recently approved of the purchase of an aircraft by Sheikh Al kaf of tne Endramaut and of our command in Aden giving what Resistance and facilities they reasonably could (repairs, use of landing grounds etc.) and we feel we cannot do lees for the Sheikh of F.oweit. though the conditions ere not exactly ^ parallel* We have no objection to the Shei'th acquiring an aeroplane and the following are the chief points which hove occurred to us, together with our decisions upon ih«- 1 . It is not much use his having an aircraft unless there are facilities available for repairs in the event of its being damaged or requiring overhaul, We are orepared to do repair, (other than running repairs and maintenance) on a repayment basis and for this purpose aircraft will have to go to one of our stations in Irsp# P. A pilot and a mechanic could not be fully employed and they would probably go to seed. We suggest •Flood lsa* t Colonial office, SeW.l. k I 1 I itlm Ithat the pilot should he one sufficiently skilled as a mechanic to carry out running repairs. 5 . The Sheikh will require a hangar of sorts for his aeroplane, and A.O.C. will h've to be consulted regarding the siting of it to ensure it does not interfere with amenities ot aerodrome fro® a flying point of view. 4 . The Sheikh must understand that he cannot enter Iraq or Saudi Arabia without permission of respective Governments, who must also consent to his use of wieir landing grounds. 5. As far as we are concerned, it has been decidecjthat we will not charge Sheikh the usual landing and housing fees on our aerodromes, though that, of course, does not cover purely Iraqi aerodromes or landing grounds. 6 . It is not our custom to allow single aircraft to undertake transdeeert flights and the Sheikh's pilot will have to be careful to follow the beaten track when flying alone if we and the Iraqis are noto to be given a great deal of trouble searching for him when he is overdue or lost. As far as I am aware, the request for information on this subject has been purely unofficial, through a representative of the A.P.O.C. and nothing has come through officially from tho Sheikh* The position as far as we are concerned, therefore, is that we will offer no objection from a service point of view and are prepared to offer what facilities we can on the lines I have mentioned above, and D. l.A. has been asked to reply to the Department of Overseas Trade accordingly.
