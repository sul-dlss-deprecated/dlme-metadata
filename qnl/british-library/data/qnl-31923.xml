H/' px [October 26.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [ 37044 ] Sir, (No. 38. Com I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith a copy of the German Minister’s letter referred to m my despatch No/2^7 of the 20th August, 1908. This letter was sent to Ur. Neligan by the A ctmg President of the Sanitary Council, and was read later in the htty-lourth meeting of that body on the 2nd September. In it the German Minister makes a number of complaints against the methods adopted by Captain Williams of the Indian Medical Service, and his conduct of the Persian Gulf Sanitary Service, and more particularly in reference to the correspondence which recently passed between'that officer and the German Consul at Bushire, a copy of which was inclosed in the same despatch. Throughout the whole letter Count Quadt shows his determination to support the Consul in his systematized campaign against the Sanitary Service. The majority of the points raised are extremely petty, and, unfortunately for the Minister, his information is not correct throughout. I propose, however, to discuss the more important points seriatim, as showing if proof were wanted that German policy is directed against the British predominant position in the Persian Gulf. It may be stated at once that every action taken by Captain Williams has been invariably confirmed by the Sanitary Council at Tehran. J Paragraph of German Ministers Letter numbered 1. In the letter from the President referred to (which I have seen myself), the latter states that he has unofficially asked Captain Williams to give notice to Consuls and others of changes made in the Quarantine Regulations (by Article 10 of the Convention of Paris the Central Government shall notify foreign Representatives resident at the capital). The German Minister has here changed “ asked ” into “ ordered ” and moreover the word “ davance ” has been inserted either by himself in his letter’to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ala-es-Sultaneh, or by the latter in his reply; the word does not occur in the President’s letter. It will be evident that while Captain Williams may very well (as he has always done directly, apart from the usual notices posted in his office) warn the Consuls on the spot of changes in the Quarantine Regulations, it cannot be expected that notice in ad vance will be given. The Incident of the Steamship “ Galicia.” 2. Captain .Williams was perfectly correct in protesting against the agent boarding the ship before the medical visit; the German Consul’s ignorance of the general principle that the quarantine officer must always be the first to visit the ship is difficult to explain—otherwise than by supposing that it was assumed for the purpose of creating an incident. In case of danger to the ship, the agent has the right to board before the doctor; but here he was perfectly able to find out that there was no danger without going on board. Moreover, as to the statement that the ship ran aground at ‘‘quelques lieues’' from the anchorage, the President has told Dr. Neligan, from information received from Bushire, that the distance was 2 leagues. It is common for ships to drop anchor from 3 to 6 miles from the shore. 3. The implication that to take local action (“ demarches locales ”) involves the use of force is, to say the least of it, far-fetched. 4. The accusation is so improbable, in view of Captain Williams’ protest referred to in paragraph 2, that it is not worth discussing. 5. This was discussed by the Sanitary Council in July 1907. Captain Williams’ action was unanimously upheld. With reference, however, to the two points here The Incident of the Steamship [1998 cc—1] Braised, it may be remarked that, firstly, the captain of the Savoia had simply a, clean bill of health for his ship from the British agent at Bahrein, hut was never given pratique at Bushire ; secondly, Captain TCilliams did all that he could to assure the comfort of the Krumpeters on the quarantine island after he had been treated most rudely by Herr Krumpeter. # _ i j i • In reviving this incident, the German Minister not only showed that his information is incorrect, but that though it was provided by the German Consulate Mirza, a Persian (there was at the time no Consul at Bushire), he believes it in preference to the written statement of a British officer. 6. In this paragraph the German Minister hopes that the limits of power of Captain Williams may be determined, and refers to his regime as being altogether arbitrary. The Convention of Paris, to which Persia is a party, defines Captain Williams’ powers; he cannot, therefore, be properly accused of arbitrariness simply because he enforces its provisions strictly and impartially. 7. Here follows a long complaint against the tone of Captain Williams’ replies to the German Consul. By removing sentences from their context, and incorrect translation of English into French (vide woid “ enforce ” translated by word “ emis,” and the rest of the sentence “in virtue of the authority vested in me by the Persian Government ” left out), a certain amount of colour was lent in the letter to these imputations. To any one, however, who reads the English original it will be obvious that Captain Williams has been perfectly correct all though ; if the tone of his replies has been cold, the German Consul’s policy of pinpricks and his assumption of ignorance of well-recognized principles do not warrant anything else. The discussion of the letter was begun at the fifty-fifth meeting of the Sanitary Council on the 2nd September, and was deferred to the next meeting, a week later. At the first discussion the sense of the meeting was strongly against the observations of the German Minister contained in paragraphs 1, 2, and 7. In the interval between the meetings a reply was drawn up by the Vice-President, Lokman-ul-Mamalek, and his French secretary. It was read at the second meeting, and I now beg to transmit a copy. The German doctor was not present, nor was Dr. Neligan, who was ill. This was unfortunate, as the letter is a very feeble defence of Captain Williams, who, after all, is the servant of the Persian Government; and in the case of paragraph 7, for the English word objected to is “ enforced,’’ not “ stated.” Before the Commission referred to in paragraph 8 a set of rules will, at its next meeting, be laid, drawn up on the basis of the recommendations of the Chief of the Sanitary Service in the Gulf and on those enforced at Constantinople. I think it will be well to endeavour to defer any final decision on these proposed local rules until after the return of Dr. Coppin on the 5th November next. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHA11LES M.

I wish to bring to your notice that on 10th June 1908, Mr. Krumpeter, the Agent of the Hamburg Amerika Line, together with his wife, boarded the S.3. ’’Galicia' before she had been inspected by the Medical Officer and given pratique. This is quite contrary to the Quarantine Regulations of the Port and in the event of its occurring again, it will be my duty to report the matter to Tehran, in addition to taking such local action as the case may necessitate. Translation of a letter No. 217, dated 16th June 1S08, irom Dr, Listemann, German Consul, Bushire# to the Ghiei Quarantine Officer in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 202, dated the 12th June 1S08, in which you intimate to me that Monsieur Lrumpeter, Agent of the Hamburg Amerika Line, boarded the steamer 'Galicia' on the 10th instant before the Medical Officer inspected her and s ave 'pratique'. tou inform me likewise that the action of Monsieur Krumpeter is contrary to the Quarantine Hegulations of the Port.I have the honour to inform you that apart from the Paris Sanitary Convention of 1903, in which no clause is found to prevent the people from boarding the vessel arriving in the port oefore the Quarantine Officer, I nave no information about any regulations and arrangements which might have been stipu lated, particularly for the port of dushire; and my enquiries regarding the existence of such rules have been resultless so far. It will certainly be desirable that persons like the ships' agents / be aware of such Regulations so that they may- know what is permissible and what is forbidden and may act accordingly; and the point will save you the trouble of giving notices to the Consulates after any of the ships' agents or any one else lias taken auction which lie did not know to be for bidden and against the law. It would therefore be a matter of gratification to me if you will kindly let me know as to where, on what date, and by whose coiUBands the rules to which you refer were brought int force and were notified, and by what means a copy thereof can be obtained, so Uiat I may notify its contents to the parties who must have information. With regard to the instance of Monsieur lirurapeter going on board the steamer 'Galicia', I have the honour to inform you that when he boarded the steamer she was neither inTile steamer ran the port nor in the Bushire anchorage.(IJote. i aground opposite Reshire, where Monsieur Xrumpeter boarded her).

I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 217, dated 16th June 1908, in reply to my No. 3/‘202, dated 11th June 1908. The rule that no one should board a Ship until she lias been dealt with by the Banitary Authorities is such a funda- l mental one that it is obviously unnecessary to mention it in such a document as the Paris Convention: in iact it iorras the basis on which the whole quarantine system hinges. The rule is so well known that it has not been found necessary in other cases to specially draw attention to it. However, to obviate any future difficulties I take this opportunity oi informing you that such a rule is enforced in the Persian Ports of the Persian Gulf by me, in virtue of the authority vested in me by the Persian Government. Translation of a letter No. 173, dated 23rd June 1908, from Dr. ListemannListeraann, German Consul, Bushire, to the Chief Quarantine Officer in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. ^08, dated iiOth June / in which you inform me that the rule that no one should go on board any vessel before she has been inspected by Medical Officer was issued by you in virtue of the power vested in you by the Persian Government. In order to avoid difficulties in future I shall be much obliged if you will kindly let me know — (l) if apart from the abov^mentioned rule any other rules have also been issued by you or by any other officials, especially in connection with the quarantine affairs of Bushire or the other parts of the Persian Gulf, which should be observed by persons having business on the ships; (2) whether any penalty and punishment have been ordained for the default of the above mentioned rule or any such rules and what are they ? and (3) if there be any objection to the opinion of the local Quarantine Officer in connection with the enforcement of such rules, punishments, etc., to whom should the objection or appeal be made - to the local Persian Government Officials, the Sanitary Department, Tehran, or any one else? I beg to offer you my best thanks in anticipation of your kind answer to the questions.

The question of special penal ties lias been for some time under the consideration of His Imperial Majesty's Government, advised by the Sanitary Council.

GULAHEK; August 2gth } igoj. No. 31 . Sir, With reference to your telegram No. 113 of July 17th last, I transmit to you extract of a report from the Acting German Vice-Consul at Bushire as to certain complaints against the quarantine administration. I should be glad to receive a report on the subject. The German Minister has addressed an official complaint to the Persian Government who have referred the matter to the Sanitary Council. Herr Stemrich communicated to me privately the report herewith enclosed in order that I might be fully informed as to the cause of the complaint. I need not point out to you that the official intervention of the British Consulate-General is to be deprecated, as the quarantine administration, though in English hands, is in theory under Persian control. I have no doubt that there has been some misunderstanding in the matter'? and that anything in the nature of a reference to the British authorities, or of discrimination against ships of any nationality has been sedulously avoidedbut I should be glad to have a report from you as to what actually occurred. I am, Sir, Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Your most obedient, humble Servant, CECIL SPRING-RICE. etc., etc, etc., Bushire. On the 9th of August S.S. “ Savoia ” arrived at Bushire from Bahrein and produced a bill of health granted by Captain Prideaux, British Poli tical A^ent, Bahrein. Dr. Ives, Quarantine Medical Officer, thereupon gave pratique to the steamer. After this Mr, Krumpeter, Agent to the Hamburg;* Amerika Line, “ Bushire,” went on board. In the afternoon Dr. Ives returned on boarT saying Captain Williams, Chief Quarantine Officer m the Gulf did not consider the above-mentioned bill of health and ordered the ship and Mr. Krum peter to undergo 5 days’ quarantine. Captain Williams first declared the bills of health granted by Captain Pn- deaux were not to be considered, as there was no quarantine officer at Bahrein. C554FDHe then told Abdul Hussein, Dragoman ^ of the German Vice-Consulate those bills of health were to be considered, but in the special case of Savoia ” U ^ f whether there were no cases of plague at Bahrein on the day the bm W of health was granted. Atlast he told M. Abdul Hussein that he had asked His Britannic Majesty’s Acting Consul-General whether the Savo.a ought to be given pratique, and received a negative reply. Now Captain Williams replied to the Karguzar of Bushire who was ordered b v the Foreign Office to inquire into the case that the bill of health did not contain all the particulars and statements prescribed by the Sanitary Conference of Paris and therefore could not be considered—a reason he never brought for- nrorrt KpfrtrP. It must be noticed that the bills of health granted by Captain Prideaux have always been considered up to date. The Agent of the Hamburg-Amerika Line further reports that while the pilots of other lines never went into quarantine the pilot of the German Line had to go into quarantine every time he returned from Lingah ; and that, while the boatmen who take passengers to the quarantine island never go into quarantine, those who took Mr. Krumpeter there have been kept in quarantine. Copy of a letter from Major P. Z. Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to C. M. Marling, Esq., His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires, Tehran, No 18, dated Shiraz, ijth October 1907 . I have the honour to reply to Sir Cecil Spring-Rice’s despatch No. 31, dated August 29th, which has been forwarded to me. from Bushire. It will be remembered that it gave cover to a statement submitted by the .Mirza of the German Consulate at Bushire, to his Legation, containing certain complaints against the procedure of the Persian Gulf Quarantine Administration, in connec tion with the visit of the Hamburg-Amerika Company’s Steamer “ Savoia ” to Bushire on 8th—9th July. I was not myself present in Bushire when the “ Savoia ” called, having left my head-quarters on 26th June for Shiraz whither I arrived by the Firouzabad route on 16th July. I am fortunate, however, in being able to forward a copy of a memorandum regarding the incident in question which was recorded and despatched to me at the time (nth July) for my informal information, and which reached me a few days after my arrival at Shiraz. On receipt of it the only action I took was to send an unofficial message to Captain Williams saying that his procedure appeared to have been correct and warranted, and inquiring whether he wished me to make any communication on my own account, in his support to His Majesty’s Minister in order that the latter might be forewarned of the facts. Captain Williams replied that unless Mr. Krumpeter pursued the matter he did not think there was any need for me to take steps in the direction suggested. 1 may add that I also suggested to Captain Williams that unless Mr. Krumpeter did seek to pursue the case it would perhaps be needless for him to press his official complaint against him any further. To the memorandum of July nth have been annexed some observations upon the two points now raised for the first time in the statement received from the German Legation, namely, {a) the treatment of pilots and (b) the quarantin ing of the crew of Mr. Krumpeter’s boat. I have added in a separate memorandum comment of my own upon the details of the incident as reported to me in the first instance, and I beg to add the following expression of views on the general aspect of the case for your considerations. It seems to me to be demonstrated from the papers enclosed :— (i) That the “ Savoia ” arrived in quarantine and that it was clearly necessary to keep her in quarantine, until it was known whether Bahrein had been free from plague for the requisite time.(ii) That Mr. Krumpeter violated the quarantine after specific warning and had to thank himself for any inconvenience which he thereby suffered. (iii) That Captain Williams’ procedure was quite correct from a pro fessional point of view, and indeed received the endorsement and support of the Sanitary Council. (iv) That he treated Mr. and Mrs. Krumpeter with as much courtesy and consideration as the circumstances permitted. (v) That there was no interference whatever on the part of the Residency and Consulate-General. In this connection I would observe that, with the knowledge born of long experience that foreign representatives in the Gulf are always prone to imagine, the British Residency to be the deua ex machina in regard to such quarantine difficulties, the Residency is primd facie proportionately careful to avoid giving grounds for complaint in this respect. (vi) That even had Mr. Krumpeter’s bearing at all encouraged (which it did not) the sentimental suggestion, that he had made a mis take and might have been granted the favour of exemption as a special case, 1 am of opinion that Captain Williams would not have been justified in adopting it ; and I feel that l have good grounds for holding that view. A few years ago the quarantine Administration was very indulgent in these matters, and exceptions were often made in favour of European Residents of Bushire, who were permitted to do quarantine in their houses; but in the first place it was found that this discrimination in favour of Europeans created much soreness and unpleasant comment among Persian officials and native gentlemen of the community ; and, secondly, the practice was strongly disapproved by experts such as Dr. Faivre who visited the Gulf, and by the Sanitary Council whose President decided that “ ces pratiques detestable doivent cesser.” In order to strengthen the Doctor’s hands in putting a stop to the practice I took an opportunity, as senior European official in Bushire, to perform the full period of detention at the quarantine station on my next arrival by mail steamer at Bushire and since then all exemptions have been rigidly refused, even in the case of exalted personages with strong introductions like the Prince Bibesco party as you will perhaps remember. I may also mention that I supported the quarantine authorities in sending to quarantine one of my own assistants who had_ thoughtlessly boarded a vessel in quarantine in order to say goodbye to some friends. I have merely mentioned these facts in order to demonstrate the necessity which exists for rigid enforcement of the Regulations. In conclusion I venture to explain that two matters of complaint contained in the present memorandum from the German Legation, regarding [a) the treatment of pilots and {b) the treatment of Mr. Krumpeter’s boatmen, are entirely new to Captain Williams, and although I quite understand, that the German Minister’s communication was purely friendly and informal in nature, as it indeed could only be, in the matter of a complaint against the quarantine administration of the Persian Government, I am not sure that it is techni cally advisable for the Chief Quarantine Officer to defend himself in the first instance through diplomatic channels against complaints which have never been made to him locally or through the Sanitary Council. This, however, is a point which you are in the best position to appraise and I have therefore forwarded, though separately, the explanations afforded on these points as well as the others for such treatment as you may consider expedient. I have no special comment to make in regard to these latter explanations except to say that they seem to me complete.Trusting that you will feel able generally to concur in the views which I have expressed. Note on quarantine incident. In the case of S.S. “ Savoia ' on 8th—gth July igof (recorded nth July igof). The Hamburg-American S.S. “ Savoia ’’ entered anchorage about 9-30 A.M. Dr, Ives going off reached the ship about the same time (9-40 A.M ) as a boat containing Mr. and Mrs. Krumpeter. The former called out and asked if the ship was in quarantine. Dr. Ives said “ Yes. ” Mr. Krumpeter said he had received information from Bahrein that the Political Agent had declared that there was no plague there and he called up to the Captain who was on the bridge and asked him if that was not so. The Captain said “ Yes” and that he had a clean Bill of Health from the Political Agent. Dr. Ives told Mr. Krumpeter that he w 7 as sure Captain Williams would not accept that Bill of Health as sufficient and moreover that the Quarantine authorities had received a letter the day before stating that there had been 20 deaths from plague at Bahrein for the week ending 5th. He also told Mr. Krumpeter that even if the Captain held such a Bill of Health, the ship would still be in quarantine, as the quarantine lasted for 10 days after the close of the last case. Mrs. Krumpeter also appealed to the Doctor saying she was very anxious to go aboard, but he repeat ed that he was certain the Residency Surgeon would decide that the ship was in quarantine. Dr. Ives then went on board and saw the ship’s papers including the Bill of Health from Captain Prideaux dated 6th. A few minutes later the quarantine guard informed Dr. Ives that Mr. Krumpeter had come on board. He found him and his wife sitting inside the companion hatchway with the Captain. He told him that he would probably have to go to quarantine. He replied that he did not see how Captain Williams could quarantine them as the ship had a clean Bill of Health. Dr. Ives left a guard on the ship which had come in flying the quarantine flag. He asked the Captain to lend him his Bill of Health for the decision of Captain Williams, and left. At a short distance from the ship he looked up and noticed that the quarantine flag had been re moved. Dr. Ives reported about 11-30 to Captain Williams who decided that the ship was in quarantine. Dr. Ives w r ent aboard about 1 with the quarantine certificate and the Captain rehoisted the quarantine flag. {Note (a ).—The behaviour of the Captain and officers was excellent throughout; they were perfectly polite to Dr. Ives and chaffed Mr. Krumpeter.) {Aote ( 3 ).—On Dr. Ives’ departure Captain Williams sent Kal Abdulla to tell Mr. KrumpetePs servants to make arrangements for his comfort.) Dr. Ives told Mr. Krumpeter that he would have to go to quarantine. He repeated the Bill of Health argument and said he would not go to the quarantine island. He was very much excited but w^as polite. To cut''matters short Dr. Ives recommended him to write himself to Captain Williams. Mrs. Krumpeter wrote the letter (copy enclosed) which he signed, and Dr. Ives brought it ashore. Captain Wiliiams replied that he much regretted inability to make any excep tion ; said he had informed his servants and would do all he could to make him comfortable. The reply was sent by Kal Abdulla who found Mr. Krumpeter sailing in his ov»n boat (M^ashowa). Captain W illiams sent Dr. Pettigrew after the letter and he caught Kal Abduilaup. He went out in the quarantine Mashowa and stopped Mr. Krumpeter s boat about 300 yards from the Customs wharf and handed him the letter. (&lt; Mr. Krumpeter threw the letter into the sea and said it is a damned shame. There was a quarantine guard in the boat; the latter said that he told them to go to quarantine, but Mr. Krumpeter had forced his boatmen to sail into Bushire.^ At that moment Captain Williams himself arrived on u\e quay. He had come in consequence of a statement by a man sent back b) twi Abdulla, who said that Mr. Krumpeter was sailing in (Dr. Pettigrew hadnot arrived when Kal Abdulla sent this man). Then both boa f s came in and everyone shouted to them to anchor. Captain Williams and Dr. Pettigrew went off and got alongside, the boat having then anchored. Mr. Krumpeter stood up and waved the tiller shouting. “ Captain Williams, this is the worst da)’s work you ever did. You will suffer for this. I will not goto quarantine”. Captain Williams replied. “ In that case you will have to stay here”. He sent 2 more guards into the boat and threw over the quarantine flag. Mr. Krum* peter called out excitedly in Persian. “ We will hoist the German flag ”. He did not however resist the hoisting of the quarantine flag. Captain Williams tried to persuade him to hear reason, but the boat drifted away astern and met the German Mirza coming off. Captain Williams told him the facts and he replied that he had heard a different version, namely, that Dr. Ives had told them they could come on board as the ship would probably not be in quarantine. He repeated the arguments and tried to entangle Captain Williams in an argument about the competency of Captain Prideaux to issue the certificate. Captain Williams said that he needed to see an authoritative statement issued by the British Residency and Consulate-General, to the effect that Bahrein had been free from plague for five clear days, before he could telegraph to Tehran for instructions as to raising quarantine ; and that he was, as a matter of fact, recommending that 10 days clear should be required in the case of Bahrein (mWe telegram attached). The argument was prolonged, but at last the German Mirza accepted the situation : went and spoke to Mr. and Mrs. Krumpeter and returned saying that they would go. Captain Williams told the Mirza to see him in the morning if he had anything to say, and left, directing Dr. Pettigrew to go over to the island and see them made comfortable. Next morning Mr. Krumpeter told Dr. Pettigrew that, he was going to make an enquiry as to Captain Prideaux’s right to board the ship, if his certificate was not recognised. On 10th July 1907 the German Mirza visited Captain Williams at the Hospital. He repeated the same arguments and Captain Williams said he accepted the certificate for exactly what it said, namely, that there was no infec tious disease on that date at Bahrein. He then tried to get exemption as a favour. Captain Williams told him to point out a flavy in his reasoning or a case of favour itism since he had been in charge. He admitted that he could produce none. Two customs tally-clerks who had followed Mr. Krumpeter aboard were also quarantined. Subsequently as it appeared from Dr. Pettigrew’s account of Mr. Krum- peter’s demeanour on the quarantine island, that he was breathing threats ot action to be taken by him on his release. Captain Williams felt called upon to enter an official protest against his conduct. A copy of his communication to the German Mirza is attached. No reply has ever been received to this communication. S S. “SAVOIA ”, 8th July 1907. Dear Captain Williams, The quarantine Doctor just tells us that Mrs. Krumpeter and myse f should go in quarantine and stay the’re -or five days^ The ship arrived ™orn,ng from Bahrein with a clean Bill of Health signed by Captain Prideaux who told he Captain of this ship that the official order of quarantine is removed since the 6th P Iulv The last mail boat of the British India took this order from Bahrein to the oAer Gulf places. Therefore I ask the permission to let us go ashore without any trouble. Yours sincerely, u DTTAif PPTTTZ F?

(WILLIAMS.) No. S.- 378 , dated the nth July 1907 , From—C aptain r T. S. B. Williams, Chief Quarantine Officer in the Persian Gulf, To— Agha MirZA Abdul HUSSEAN, Translator, German Consulate, Bushire. In continuation of our conversation of yesterday and before considering the matter finally closed, I feel obliged to enter into a protest against the conduct of Mr. Krumpeter :— (1) On account of his refusal to go to Quarantine when he was ordered to do so by the proper authorities. (2) On account of the exceedingly rude manner in which he publicly addressed me while in the execution of my duty. Such conduct could not be tolerated by any Sanitary Administration and I request that you will take steps to bring his conduct to the notice of the Imperial German Legation. Comment. {By Major P. Z. Cox on the details of the incident as received from Bushire.) (1) “ Dr. Ives gave pratique to the steamer.” That this is not so is proved in the clearest possible way by Mr. Krumpeter’s own letter written on the ship, in which he distinctly states that Dr. Ives told him then that he would have to go to Quarantine for 5 days. It is inconceivable that Mr. Krumpeter should not have mentioned the grant of pratique, if such had been granted by Dr. Ives as now alleged. Further, the grant of pratique is effected by the delivery of a certificate by the Quarantine Authority to the ship. If such a certificate was granted it must be on the “ Savoia ” or in the possession of the Agents. The statement made by the German representative, if true, could be proved by the production by him of this certificate. It is not true how T ever. (2) “ Captain Williams declared that the Bills of Health granted by Captain Prideaux were not to be considered.” What Captain Williams consistently stated was, that he accepted the Bill of Health, which w'as drawn in the ordinary form of such documents, for exactly what it said, and that the facts therein recited did not justify him in raising Quarantine. The certificate merely cited the fact that the “ Savoia ” was leaving for Bushire at a certain hour and date and stated that on the day of issue there was to his knowledge no infectious or contagious disease in Bahrein. There may have been 50 deaths from plague the day before, for all Captain Williams could tell from the certificate. The distinction drawn on this occasion was not as the German Mirza seems •to have thought, between Bills of Health granted by Captain Prideaux and the same documents granted by any other official; the distinction drawn was between a Bill of Health granted at a recently plague-infected port and one granted at a healthy port. When, as now, Bahrein is admittedly healthy, the Political Agent’scertificates to that effect would suffice to justify the grant of pratique to any ship. When however Bahrein or any other port is known to have been recently infected, the mere certificate that no case of plague or other infectious disease occurred on the day of issue is not sufficient to justify the declaration that the port is “ free ” under the Paris convention. In snch cases the Quarantine Officer is bound by Article 9 of the said Convention It was a pure accident that the ship in this case happened to be a German vessel; exactly the same treatment would have been meted out to a ship of any other nationality. 3. “ He (Captain Williams) told Mirza Abdul Hussein that he had asked His Britannic Majesty’s Acting Consul-General, whether the “ Savoia ” ought to be given pratique and received a negative reply.” This is altogether untrue. It is apparently a perversion of the remark made by Captain Williams that he would need to see an authoritative statement issued by the British Residency and Consulate-General to the effect that Bahrein had been free from plague for 5 days before he could make any report to the Sani tary Council recommending the raising of quarantine. The British Residency and Consulate-General is the natural source from which the Quarantine Administration would obtain authoritative information of this nature either through the Governor of Bushire cr direct to save time. Supplementary note received from Bushire regarding two fresh grounds of complaint now adduced in the complaint received through the German Legation. Pilots .—The statement as made is entirely untrue— (a) The only exemption accorded in the case of pilots is that allowed to regular pilots who have been inoculated ; these are permuted to board ships at the outer anchorage at Bushire, pilot them into the inner anchorage and leave them there without undergoing quaran tine, provided they board the ships in company with the quarantine guards, proceed straight to the bridge and leave direct from the bridge to their own boats without holding communication with passengers or crew. The presence of the quarantine guards on board ensures compliance with this regulation. No pilot who makes any voyage in any ship is exempt from, quarantine. .This system has been in force from a period anterior to the incident under report. (b) “ Mr. Rrumpeter's boatmen.—\X. is difficult, to understand the grounds ^ of'this objection. Mr. Krumpeter was in quarantine. He left, the ship in his own boat entirely by his own choice. Had he waited, the quarantine boat would have taken him to quarantine. In point of fact he took his own boat and obliged the men to proceed to the Customs wharf, in spite of the opposition of the quarantine guard who was on board. He was not therefore pro ceeding to quarantine, but was endeavouring forcibly to evade it. The reason for quarantining his boatmen was the valid sanitary reason that they had been in contact with him and Mrs. Krum peter who were in quarantine. T he reason for not quarantining the ordinary quarantine boatmen is surely fairly obvious, and would have been brought home to Mr. Krumpeter if the measure had been enforced during his stay on the island by the simple fact that he would have had no food or drink. Even in the strictest possible svstem someone must be allowed to communicate with the quaran tine station, but under a strict system, as enforced here, the number cf such persons is restricted to the smallest possible,. the same men are regularly employed on this, service, they are inoculated, kept under close medical observation, and on return from any service which may necessitate such a measure they are disinfected together with the boat./ 0^3 c 5 No. 1010 , dated Bushire ; the nth (received aoth) May 1907 (Confidentia From— MAJOR P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— SIR LOUIS W. Dane, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to refer to my letter No. 536, dated 10th March 1907, regarding a certain quarantine incident at Bunder Abbas and to apprise Govern ment of the subsequent course of it. 2. The correspondence of which copies accompany for the most part explains itself, but perhaps the first two items need some additional explanation. In the absence of the Residency Surgeon who had to leave Bushire immediately after he had despatched to the Sanitary Council the copy of his subordinate’s telegram . of 9th March (of which a copy accompanied my letter No. 536) and it being obviously inadvisable for me as Resident to identify myself with this or any quarantine case, I naturally deprecated the strenuous diplo matic action which was apparently contem plated by the Minister in regard to this oaiea ^ incident which had originated between two natives and which in any case seemed of less importance than the previous incident, in regard to which he had decided not to identify himself with it officially , J but to leave it to the Sanitary Council to deal with. q Our case suffered owing to an unfortunate combination of circumstances ; Captain Williams’ absence from Bushire; Lieutenant Gabriel’s absence from Bunder Abbas on tour; and Assistant Surgeon Montgomery s neglect to proceed on board in the first instance, an omission which Monsieur Ovseenko quick^ took advantage of by grossly misrepresenting the Captain of the Madura and putting a version of the facts into his mouth to which he had never given utter ance. Had we had the Captain’s statement in the first instance, our case would have been strong enough. (1) Minister to Resident, telegram No. 30. dated 12th March IQ07.

Please refer to me telegram No. 31. lam informed by the Russian Minister that as soon as the incident was reported, the Russian Consul demanded strict enquiry in the presence of the Captain and the English Officers of the vessel, the sanitary delegate and all the passengers. The accusation that the Russian Consul’s servant had violated the quarantine regulations was repudiated unanimously and the Doctor’s report was qualified by the English Captain as an impudent calumniation. The Russian Consul added that the Doctor categorically refused his demand for a further enquiry as to the alleged assault by his servant. Is it not possible that this version may be true ? Copy of a telegram, dated 22nd March igoj, from Lieutenant C. H. Gabriel, His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Bunder Abbas, to Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.Ey, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Please refer to your telegram No. 129. An attempt was made by Montgomery last Monday to elicit evidence from the Captain of the &lt;f Madura”. The latter however would state nothing to the point. I fear under these circumstances that our case is rather weak, but as 1 consider that an offence really was committed by the Russian, I submit that we should make the most of the existing scanty evidence. 1 am of opinion that the weakness of our case is due to the fact that Montgomery did not proceed at once to the ship to secure all the evidence available.

(Enclosure No. 8.) Copy of a telegram No. 30 — 138, dated 25th March 1907, from Major P. Z. Cox } C.I.E.i Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to Sir Cecil Spring Rice, K.C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran. Please refer to previous correspondence on the subject of the Quarantine incident at Bunder Abbas. Captain Williams has since returned and sent Schneider to-day the telegram of which you have received a copy. It was not advisable for His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Bunder Abbas to in any way identify himself with the case outwardly, but the opinion has been expressed by him that a breach of the Quarantine regulations was undoubtedly committed by the Russian Munshi, who is of an assertive character and notoriously quarrel some and that in that connection the Doctor’s authority should be supported, but that the Doctor weakened his case as regards the assault by not immediately proceeding on boardship and allowing Ovseenko to forestall him. I agree with Williams that it was incumbent on Ovseenko to first comply with the necessary and reasonable demand of the Quarantine officer, and having done so, to proceed afterwards to argue the case. It is to be remembered that there is no force at the disposal of Quarantine Doctors so that it is the more necessary that the Sanitary Council should support their personal authority in enforcing the regulations and it is to be hoped that they will assume the attitude recommended by Williams and hold that the Consul was in the wrong. Apart from this I hardly think that this particular case originating between two natives is important or strong enough by itself to warrant official diplomatic action, but please see my letter, dated 9th March, No. 27, and previous papers with regard^tq the general attitude of the Russian Consulate towards Quarantine. Meanwhile. Captain Williams has left for Bunder Abbas and good may result from a frank interview with Ovseenko. (Enclosure No. 9.)

With reference to the Quarantine incident, please warn Captain Williams that he should be conciliatory and that he should drop the case if it is not good. We must hit to kill when we hit at all.

With reference to the correspondence ending with your telegram No. 40, dated 29th March, on the subject of the quarantine incident connected with the S.S. “ Madura ” while in port at Bunder Abbas, I have the honour to trans mit for your information a copy of a statement furnished to Captain Williams, Chief Quarantine Officer, by the Captain of the steamer.

General Provisions. Chapter I. Provisions to be observed by the Countries signing the Convention on the appearance of Plague or Cholera in their Territory. Section I.— Notification and subsequent Communications to the other Countries. Article 1. Every Government must immediately notify to the other Governments the first appearance of recognized cases of plague or cholera in its territory. Art. 2. Such notification shall be accompanied or very promptly followed by detailed information as to :— (1.) Where the disease has appeared ; (2.) The date of its appearance, its source, and its type ; (3.) The number of known cases and deaths; (4.) In the case of plague, the presence of, that disease or of unusual mortality among rats or mice ; (5.) The measures taken immediately on the first appearance of the disease. Art. 3. The notification and the information prescribed in Articles 1 and 2 shall be supplied to the diplomatic or Consular agencies in the capital of the infected country. In the case of countries not represented there, the notification and the information shall be telegraphed direct to the Govern ments of these countries. Art. 4. The notification and the information prescribed in Articles 1 and 2 shall be followed by subsequent communications furnished regularly and in such fashion as to keep the Govern ments informed of the course of the epidemic. These communications shall be made at least once a week, shall be as complete as possible, and shall, in particular, indicate the precautions adopted with a view to prevent the spread of the disease. They must set out with precision: (1) the preventive measures taken in the way of sanitary inspection or of medical investigation, of isolation, and of disinfection ; (2) the measures adopted in the case of outgoing vessels to prevent exportation of the disease, and, particularly, in the case contemplated in Article 2 (4), the measures taken against rats. Art. 5. It is of primary importance that the foregoing provisions be promptly and scrupulously complied with. Notification is of no real value unless every Government be itself informed, in time, of cases of plague and cholera and also ofdoubtful cases occurring in its territory. It cannot, therefore, be too strongly impressed on the several Governments that they should make notification of plague and cholera compulsory, and that they should keep themselves informed as to any unusual mortality among rats or mice, particularly in ports. Art. 6. It is to be understood that neighbouring countries reserve to themselves the right to make special arrangements with the object of organizing direct exchange of information between the principal administrative officers on their frontiers. Section If.— The Conditions under which a Local Area may be regarded as infeded or as having ceased to be infected. Art. 7. The notification of a first case of plague or cholera shall not lead to the adoption of the measures prescribed in the following Chapter II against the local area in which the case has occurred. But when several non-imported cases of plague have occurred, or when the cases of cholera constitute a foyer* the local area shall be declared infected. Art. 8. In order that the measures be limited to places which are infected, the Governments must apply them to arrivals from infected local areas only. “ Local area ” means a portion of territory clearly defined in the information that accompanies or follows notification—as, for instance, a province, a “ government,” a district, a department, a canton, an island, a commune, a town, a quarter in a town, a village, a port, a polder, an agglomeration, &amp;c., whatever may be the extent and population of these portions of territory. But this limitation to the infected local area must be accepted oidy on the definite condition that the Government of the infected country take the measures necessary (a) for preventing the export of the things specified in Article 12 (l) and (2) derived from the infected local area, unless previously disinfected, and (5) for checking the spread of the epidemic. When a local area is infected, no restrictive measure shall be taken against arrivals from that local area, if they have left it not less than five days before the beginning of the epidemic. Art. 9. In order that a local area cease to be regarded as infected it must be officially established—• (1.) That no death from nor fresh case of plague or cholera has occurred within the five days following either the isolation! or the death or recovery of the last case of plague or cholera; (2.) That all measures of disinfection have been carried out, and that, in the case of plague, measures have been taken against rats. * I.e., a “ centre of dissemination.”—E ditor. t “Isolation” means the isolation of the sick person, of those in permanent attendance on him, and the prohibition of visits by any other person.Chapter II. m port*. r N Heighbouri^[ 'ecial of lr i r °ntiers. ^getneiits, i a, se plague ■sures ea in of pl&gt;gueta( % ‘m'tkeiBi,: Measures of Defence, on the part of the other Countries, against Territories that have been declared infected. Section I.— Publication of Measures 'prescribed. Art. 10. The Government of each country shall immediately make public the measures which it considers necessary to prescribe with regard to arrivals from an infected country or local area. It shall forthwith communicate these measures to the diplo matic or Consular Agent of the infected country resident in the capital, and also to the International Sanitary Boards. It shall also communicate, through the same channels, the withdrawal of these measures or any modifications of them. In the absence of a diplomatic or consular agency in the capital, the communications shall be made direct to the Government of the country concerned. . toplacesji; V tliem to arrivals I mtory dearly lows notification^; district, a departu a quarter in a it &amp;c, whatever! ns of territory. &gt;al area must head! overnmentofleiil® for preventing hfE md (2) derived fi: disinfected, and f istrictive measure I ja, if they have left i: of the epidemic, cease to he regaiH se of plague or ckfc ig either the it plague or cholera: on have been caniei is have been taken? roK. .... .he sick person ,® 11 ibition of visits W Section II.— Merchandize. — Disinfection.—Importation and Transit. — Baggage. Art. 11. No article of merchandize is in itself capable of conveying plague or cholera. Merchandize becomes dangerous only when contaminated by plague or cholera products. Art. 12. Only such merchandize and things as the local sanitary authority considers infected may he subjected to disinfection. Provided always that the merchandize or things hereinafter specified may be subjected to disinfection or their importation may even be prohibited, irrespective of any evidence as to whether or not they are infected:— (1.) Body-linen, wearing apparel, bedding that has been in use. But when these things are carried as baggage, or m consequence of a change of abode (household goods), their importation may not he prohibited, hut they shall he dealt with as prescribed in Article 19. Soldiers’ and sailors’ kits, returned to their country after their death, are to be regarded as of the nature of the things specified in the first sentence of (1) of this Article. (2.) Bags, save, in the case of cholera, rags compressed and carried in bound bales as merchandize in bulk. The importation of the following articles may not . be prohibited Fresh waste derived directly from spinning, weaving, making up or bleaching establishments ; artificial wools {Kunstwollc, shoddy) and new paper clippings.Art. 13. The transit of the merchandize and things specified in (1) and (2) of the foregoing Article may not be prohibited if they are packed so that they cannot be manipulated on the way. Similarly, when such merchandize and things have been so conveyed that they cannot have come into contact with contaminated articles on the way, their transit through an infected local area must not hinder their importation into the country to which they are consigned. Art. 14. Importation of the merchandize and things specified in (1) and (2) of Article 12 shall not be prohibited if it be proved to the authority of the country to which they are consigned that they were despatched not less than five days before the commencement of the epidemic. Art. 15. It rests with the authority of the country to which the merchandize and things are consigned to decide in what manner and at what place disinfection shall be carried out, and what shall be the methods adopted to secure destruction of rats. These operations must be performed in such fashion as to injure articles as little as possible. It rests with each State to settle questions of consequent compensation for damage caused by measures of disinfection or of rat-destruction. If, on account of measures taken to secure destruction of rats on board ship, charges are levied by the sanitary authority either directly or indirectly through a company or a private person, the rates of these charges must be in accordance with a tariff made public beforehand, and so drawn up that the State or the sanitary authority shall, on the whole, derive no profit from its application. Art. 16. Letters and correspondence, printed matter, books, newspapers, business documents, &amp;c. (not including parcels con veyed by post), shall not be subject to disinfection or to any restriction whatsoever. Art. 17. Merchandize, whether it has come by land or by sea, may not be detained at frontiers or at ports. The only measures that may be taken are those specified in the foregoing Article 12. Provided always that if merchandize, which has come by sea and is either not packed or imperfectly packed, has become infected during the voyage by rats ascertained to have plague, and if such merchandize cannot be disinfected, the destruction of the germs may be secured by storing the merchandize during a period not to exceed two weeks. It is to be understood that the application of this measure shall not in any way delay the ship nor give rise to extra expenses by reason of deficient storage accommodation in any port. Art. 18. When merchandize has undergone disinfection in accordance with the provisions of Article 12, or has beentemporarily stored in virtue of the proviso contained in Article 17, the proprietor of such merchandize or his representative has the right to exact from the sanitary authority that has ordered the disinfection or the storage, a certificate showing the measures that have been taken. Art. 19. Baggage. —Soiled linen, clothing and articles carried as baggage or as household goods, from a local area declared to be inflected, shall undergo disinfection only in those instances where the sanitary authority considers them infected. Section III. —Measures at 'ports and land frontiers. Art. 20. Classification of ships. —A ship shall be regarded as infected if there is plague or cholera on hoard or if there have been one or more cases of plague or cholera on board within seven days. A ship shall be regarded as suspected if there have been cases of plague or cholera on board at the time of departure or during the voyage, but no fresh case within seven days. A ship shall be regarded as healthy, notwithstanding its having come from an infected port, if there has been no death from nor case of plague or cholera on board either before departure or during the voyage or on arrival. Art. 21. In the case of plague, infected, ships shall undergo the following measures:— (1.) Medical inspection; (2.) The sick shall immediately be disembarked and isolated; (3.) The other persons must also be disembarked if possible, and either be kept under observation * during a period which shall not exceed live days and which may or may not be followed by surveillance f of not more than five days’ duration, or merely be subjected to surveillance during a period which shall not exceed ten days. The period shall date from the arrival of the ship. It rests with the sanitary authority of the port, after taking into considera tion the date of the last case, the condition of the ship, and the local possibilities, to take that one of these measures which seems to them preferable; (4.) Such soiled linen, wearing apparel, and articles belonging to the crew l and passengers as are, in the opinion of the sanitary authority, infected shall be disinfected ; * “ Observation” means isolation of travellers either on board a ship or in a sanitary station before they obtain a free pratique. f “Surveillance” means that travellers are not isolated ; they receive free pratique immediately, but the authorities of the several places whither they are bound are informed of their coming and they are subjected to medical examination with a view to ascertaining their state of health. f 41 Crew ” means persons forming or having formed part of the crew or staff of the ship, and includes stewards, waiters, cafedji, &amp;c. The word must be interpreted in this sense in all instances in which it occurs in this Convention.J (5.) The parts of the ship that have been occupied by persons ill with plaoue, or that, in the opinion of the sanitaiy authority, are infected, must be disinfected; • i i &lt;&gt; (6.) The rats on board must be destroyed, either before or after discharge of cargo, as quickly as possible, and, in anj' case, within a maximum time of forty-eight hours, and so as to avoid damage to merchandize and to the ship s plating and engines. In the case of ships in ballast, this process must be carried out as soon as possible before taking cargo. Art. 22. In the case of plague, suspected ships shall undergo the measures specified in (1), (4), and (5) of Article 21. In addition, the crew and passengers may be subjected to surveillance, the duration of which, dating from the arrival of the ship, shall not exceed five days. The crew may, during the same period, be prevented from leaving the ship except on duty. Destruction of rats on board is recommended. This process shall be carried out, either before or after discharge of cargo, as quickly as possible, and, in any case, wiuhin a maximum time of forty-eight hours, and so as to avoid damage to merchandize and to the ship’s plating and engines. In the case of ships in ballast, this process, if there be occasion for it, shall be carried out as soon as possible, and, in any case, before taking cargo. Art. 23. In the case of plague, healthy ships shall be given free pratique immediately, whatever their bill of health may be. The only measures which the authority of the port of arrival may take as regards these ships are the following:— (1.) Medical inspection; (2.) Disinfection of soiled linen, wearing-apparel, and other articles belonging to the crew and passengers, but only in excep tional instances, when the sanitary authority has special reasons for regarding them as infected ; (3.) The sanitary authority may subject ships from an infected port to a process intended to secure destruction of rats on board, either before or after discharge of cargo, although this measure must not be resorted to as a general rule. This process must be carried out as soon as possible, and, in any case, must not take longer than twenty-four hours, and so as to avoid damage to merchandize and to the ship’s plating and engines, and also so as not to interfere with the coming and going of passengers and crew between ship and shore. In the case of ships in ballast, the process, if there be occasion for it, shall be carried out as soon as possible, and, in any case, before taking cargo. If a ship from an infected port has been subjected to measures of rat-destruction, these cannot be repeated unless the ship has called at an infected port and has there brought up to the quay, or unless sick or dead rats are found on board. The crew and passengers may be subjected to surveillancemig a period which shall not exceed five days reckoned from the date on which the ship left the infected port. The crew may onduty h6 Same Peri ° d ’ bG prevented from leavi “g ^e ship, except dhe competent authority at the port of arrival may, in all cases, exact a certificate, given on oath, from the doctor of the . iip or, m his default, from the captain, testifying that there has ot been a case of plague on board since departure and that unusual mortality among rats has not been observed. Art. 24. When rats on a healthy ship have been shown by bacteridogica 1 examination to have plague, or when unusual mentality among these rodents has been observed, the measures to adopt are as follows :— I. bhips with rats having plague :— (a.)

In the case of cholera, infected ships shall undergo the following measures :— (1.) Medical inspection; (2.) The sick shall be immediately disembarked and isolated; (3.) The other persons must also be disembarked, if possible, and either be kept under observation or subjected to surveillance during a period which shall vary with the health conditions of the ship and the date of the last case, but which shall not exceed five days reckoned from the arrival of the ship; (4.) Such soiled linen, wearing-apparel, and articles belonging to the crew and passengers as are, in the opinion of the sanitary authority of the port, infected shall be disinfected; (5.) The parts of the ship that have been occupied by persons ill with cholera, or that the sanitary authority regard as infected, shall be disinfected ; (6.) The bilge-water shall be disinfected and pumped out. Hie sanitary authority may order that a supply of wholesome drinking-water be substituted for that stored on board. Casting human excreta, or allowing them to pass, without preliminary disinfection, into the waters of the port may be prohibited. Art. 27. In the case of cholera, suspected ships shall undergo the measures prescribed in (1), (4), (5), and (6) of Article 26. The crew and passengers may be subjected to surveillance during a period which must not exceed five days reckoned from the arrival of. the ship. It is recommended that the crew be prevented, during the same period, from leaving the ship except on duty. r ° ^ Art. 28. In the case of cholera, healthy ships shall be given free pratique immediately, whatever their bill of health may be. The only measures that the authority of the port of arrival may piesmbe as regards these ships are those specified in (1), (4), and (6) of Article 26. w I he crew and passengers may be subjected to surveillance, in lespect of their state of health, during a period which must not exceed five days reckoned from the date on which the ship left the infected port. It is recommended that the crew be prevented, ( u mng the same period, from leaving the ship except on duty. I he competent authority at the port of arrival may, in all cases, exact a certificate, given on oath, from the doctor of the ship or, in is default, from the captain, testifying that there has not been a case of cholera on board since departure. Art. 29. In applying the measures specified in Articles 21-28, ie act of a ship of any of the three classes before-mentioned can ymg a doctor and disinfecting apparatus (disinfecting chambers) shall receive due consideration on the part of the competent au , mnty. In the case of plague, like consideration shall be givenwhen the ship is provided with apparatus for the destruction of rats. The sanitary authorities of States that find it convenient to come to an agreement on the matter, may dispense with medical inspec- mn and other measures in the case of healthy ships carrying a doctor specially commissioned by their country. Art. 30. Special measures may be prescribed as regards ships that are overcrowded, and more especially as regards emigrant ships, or any other ship in an unsanitary condition. ^ Art. 31. Ships refusing to submit to measures prescribed by a port authority, in virtue of the provisions of this Convention, shall be at liberty to put out to sea. Such ships may be permitted to land goods after the following necessary precautions have been taken, viz.:— (!•) Isolation of the ship, crew, and passengers; (2.) In the case of plague, request for information as to whether there has been any unusual mortality among rats on board; ° (3.) In the case of cholera, disinfection and evacuation of the bilge-water and the substitution of wholesome drinking-water for that stored on board. Such ships may also be authorized to disembark passengers at their request, on the condition that such passengers submit to the measures prescribed by the local authority. Art. 32. Ships from an infected place, that have been disinfected and have undergone adequate sanitary measures, shall not, on their anival in another port, be subjected to these measures a second time, if no case has occurred since the disinfection wus performed and if they have not called at an infected port. A ship which has inei ely disembarked passengers and their baggage or mails, without laving been in communication with the shore, shall not be regarded as having called at the port. Art. 33. Passengers arriving by an infected ship are entitled to exact from the sanitary authority of the port a certificate showing the date of their arrival and the measures taken as regards them selves and their baggage. . Art - 34. Coasting traffic shall be dealt with by special regula tions to be agreed upon by the countries concerned. Art. 35. Without prejudice to the right of Governments to agree to establish sanitary stations in common, every country must provide at least one port on each of its seaboards with an organiza tion and an equipment sufficient for the reception of a ship, whatever its health-conditions may be. It is recommended that, when a healthy ship from an infected [101] E 2BSBHBB port aniN'es i a a large sea-port, such ship should not be sent away to another port with a view to the carrying out of the sanitary measures prescribed. In every country, the ports open to arrivals from ports infected with plague or cholera must be so equipped that healthy ships can there undergo the prescribed measures upon their arrival and be not sent to another port for the purpose. Governments shall make known what ports in their country are open to arrivals from ports infected with plague or cholera. Art. 36. It is recommended that there be provided in large sea-ports:— (a.) A properly-organized port medical service and permanent medical supervision of the health-conditions of crews and of the population of the port; (b.) Suitable accommodation for the isolation of the sick and for keeping suspected persons under observation; (c.) Bacteriological laboratories and the buildings and plant necessary for efficient disinfection ; (rf.) A supply of drinking water of quality above suspicion at the disposal ot the port, and a system of scavenging that offers every possible guarantee for the removal of excrement and refuse. Section I\ .— Measures at land frontiers. — Travellers .— Rail ways.—Fran tier t rads.—River ways. Art. 37. Land quarantine must no longer be resorted to. Only such persons as show symptoms of plague or of cholera may be detained at frontiers. This principle does not deprive a State of the right to close a portion of its frontier's in case of need. Ait. 08 . It is important that the railway staff keep watch over the state of health of travellers. Ait. 30. Medical intervention shall be limited to inspection of travellers and care of the sick. When this inspection is resorted to, it shall, as far as possible, be combined with the Customs’ examination in order that travellers may suffer as little delay as po.-&gt;si a e. Only those persons who are visibly ailing shall be subjected to a thorough medical examination. rV, 1 - 4n ; ^ ’ s a measure of the greatest value to subject travellers that have come from an infected place, on their arrival at their destination, to surveillance for a period which should not exceed ten or five days, reckoned from the date of their departure, m the case of plague or cholera respectively. , 41.

The same procedure shall apply in the case of goods trucks. Art. 43. Measures in relation with the crossing of frontiers by railway and postal staff come within the scope of the adminis trations concerned. They should be arranged so as not to hamper the service. Art. 44. The regulation of frontier traffic and questions connected therewith, as also the adoption of exceptional measures ot surveillance, must be left as matters for special arrangement between adjoining States.

Special Provisions regarding Countries outside Europe, Chapter I, Arrivals by Sea, Section I .—Measures at Infected Ports on the Departure of Vessels. Art. 46. The competent authority shall take effectual measures to prevent the embarkation of persons showing symptoms of plague or of cholera. Every person taking passage by a ship must be individually examined at the time of embarkation, by day and on shore, during such time as may be necessary, by a doctor appointed'by the public authority. The Consular authority of the country to which the ship belongs may be represented at this examination. In exception of this provision, the medical examination may, at Alexandria and Port Said, take place on board whenever the local sanitary authority consider this course to be of service; subject, however, to the reservation that third-class passengers shall not afterwards be authorized to leave the ship. The medical examination may be conducted by night in the case of first-class84 and second-class passengers, but not in the case of third-class passengers. Art. 47. The competent authority shall take effectual measures— (1.) To prevent the exportation of such merchandize or articles of any sort as it may regard as infected and which have not previously been disinfected on shore under the supervision of a doctor appointed by the public authority; (2.) In the case of plague, to prevent rats gaining access to ships; (3.) In the case of cholera, to see that drinking-water taken on board is wholesome. Section II.— Measures regarding ordinary Ships from infected Northern Ports on their arrival at the entrance to the Suez Canal or at Egyptian Ports. Art. 48. Ordinary healthy ships from a port, infected with plague or with cholera, in Europe or in the Mediterranean basin, proposing to pass through the Suez Canal, shall be granted passage in quarantine, and shall continue their voyage under five days’ observation.

Healthy ships must have completed or must complete hve full days’ observation reckoned from the time of their departure from the last infected port touched at. They shall be entitled to pass through the Suez Canal in quarantine, and shall enter the Mediterranean continuing the above-mentioned five days’ observation. Ships with a doctor and a disinfecting chamber shall not undergo disinfection prior to the passage in quarantine. Art. 53. Suspected ships shall be treated in a manner which shall differ according as to whether they have or have not a doctor and a disinfecting apparatus (disinfecting chamber).

(C) Those that have neither doctor nor disinfecting apparatus (disinfecting chamber) shall, before being allowed to pass through the Canal in quarantine, be detained at Suez or at Moses’ Wells for such time as may be necessary for the performance of the disinfection prescribed and for assurance that the health conditions on board are satisfactory. Passage in quarantine shall be granted to mail-boats or packets specially devoted to passenger traffic that have a doctor but no disinfecting apparatus (disinfecting chamber), if it be officially established to the satisfaction of the local authority that cleansing and disinfection have been properly carried out at the place of departure or during the voyage. free pratique may be granted at Suez, on the termination of the procedure prescribed by the regulations, to mail-boats or packets specially devoted to passenger traffic that ha.ve a doctor but no disinfecting apparatus (disinfecting chamber) if the last case of plague or cholera occurred more than seven days before and if the health-conditions of the ship are satisfactory.

(a.) Ships without a doctor and without a disinfecting apparatus (disinfecting chamber) shall be detained at Moses’ Wells ;* persons that show symptoms of plague or cholera shall be disembarked and isolated in a hospital. Disinfection shall be thoroughly carried out. The other persons shall be disembarked and isolated in as small groups as possible, so that, if plague or cholera break out in one group, the whole party will not be affected. The soiled linen and the clothing of passengers and crew, and other articles used by them, shall be disinfected, as also shall the ship. It is to be understood that there is no question of discharging merchandize, but only of disinfecting the infected part of the ship. The passengers shall remain five days at an establishment appointed by the Egyptian Sanitary Maritime and Quarantine Board. When cases of plague and cholera have not occurred for several days the term of isolation shall be shortened. Its duration shall vary according to the date of recovery, death, or isolation of the last case. Thus, if six days have elapsed since the recovery, death, or isolation of the last case, the period of observation shall be one day; if only five days have elapsed, the period shall be two days ; if only four days have elapsed, the period shall be three days ; if only three days have elapsed, the period shall be four days; if only two days or one day have elapsed, the period shall be five days. (6.) Ships with a doctor and a disinfecting apparatus (dis infecting chamber) shall be detained at Moses’ Wells.

When plague or cholera has occurred only among the crew, the disinfection of linen shall be carried out only as regards the soiled linen of the crew and the linen of the crew’s quarters. The ship’s doctor must also declare, on oath which part or compartment of the ship was occupied by the sick and to which * The sick shall, as far as possible, bo landed at Moses’ Wells; the other persons may be kept under observation at a sanitary station appointed by the Egyptian Sanitary Maritime and Quarantine Board (pilots’ lazaret),section of the hospital they were removed. He must also declare, on oath, which persons have been in relation with the plague or cholera patient since the first appearance of the disease, either by direct contact or by contact with objects that may have been infected. Only these persons shall be regarded as suspected. The part or compartment of the ship and the section of the hospital that have been occupied by the sick shall be thoroughly disinfected. “ Part of the ship ” shall mean the cabin of the sick person, the adjoining cabins, the passage to these cabins, the deck, the parts of the deck where the sick person or persons have remained for some time. If it be impossible to disinfect the part or compartment of the ship that has been occupied by plague or cholera sick without disembarking the persons declared to be suspected, these persons shall either be transferred to another ship specially reserved for the purpose, or be landed and accommodated in the sanitary station without being brought into contact with the sick, who must be kept in the hospital. This stay on board ship or on shore, for purposes of disinfec tion, shall be as short as possible, and shall not exceed twenty-four hours. I he suspected persons shall be kept under observation, either on their own ship or on the ship reserved for that purpose, for a period which shall vary according to the circumstances and in the manner set out in the third paragraph of sub-section («) of this Article. ihe time occupied in carrying out the measures prescribed by the regulations shall be included in the observation period. Passage in quarantine may, if deemed possible by the sanitary authority, be allowed before expiry of the periods of detention indicated above.

IV .—Miscellaneous Provisions. Art. 1/7. Each Government shall decide as to the means it shall employ to secure disinfection and the destruction of rats.* Art. 178. The sums realised by sanitary charges and tines may not, in any instance whatever, be used for any purposes other than those under the control of the Boards of Health. Art. 179. The High Contracting Parties undertake that their Public Health Departments shall frame a set of instructions intended to enable ship captains, particularly w 7 hen there is no doctor on board, to carry out the provisions of this Convention regarding plague and cholera, and also to carry out the regulations regarding yellow fever. * The following methods of disinfection are given by way of guide :— Wearing-apparel, old rags, infected dressings, papers and other articles of no value should be burnt. Personal effects, bedding, mattresses infected with plague can be efficiently disinfected either by means of a high-pressure steam disinfecting chamber or a current-steam disinfecting chamber at a temperature of 100° Centigrade, or by exposure to formol vapours. Articles, such as coverlets and bed-linen, that can be steeped in antiseptic solutions without damage, can be disinfected by 1 per 1,000 solutions of perchloride of mercury, 3 per 100 solutions of carbolic acid, 3 per 100 solutions of lysol or commercial cresyl, 1 per 100 solutions of formol (one part of the commercial solution of formaldehyde at 40 per 100), or 1 per 100 solutions of the alkaline hypochlorites (sodium or potassium), that is to say, 1 part of the ordinary solution of commercial hypochlorite. The period of contact must obviously be long enough to allow dried germs to be well penetrated by the antiseptic solution : four to six hours will suffice. To secure destruction of rats, three processes are now made use of:— (1.) Sulphurous acid mixed with a small quantity of sulphuric anhydride, driven under pressure into holds and mixed with the air. This destroys rats and insects and will, it is stated, destroy the plague-bacillus also if the proportion of sulphuro-sulphuric anhydride be sufficiently great. (2.)

The last two methods kill rodents, but it is not claimed that they destroy insects or the plague-bacillus. The Technical Commission of the Paris (1903) Sanitary Conference specified the three following processes—a mixture of sulphuro-sulphuric anhydrides, a mixture of carbonic oxide and carbonic acid, and carbonic acid,—as being among those to which Governments might resort, and expressed the opinion that the sanitary authority should, in every instance where it did not itself do the work, superintend its performance and make sure that the rats had been killed.

A copy of the Uespatch covering this Memorandum will be sent to the India Office shortly. Eoreign Office, 31st October 1903. Annex. Memorandum on Sanitary Measures in the Persian Gulf since 1891. The question of the sanitary defence of the Persian Gulf has been the subject of repeated discussions in the Constantinople Board of Health, and was formally dealt with by representatives of the Powers in the International Sanitary Conferences of 1894 and 1897. A .—Paris Sanitary Conference, 1894. The Sanitary Conference of 1894 (Paris) dealt with cholera only, and appointed three Commissions, namely:—( 1 ) Red Sea and Pilgrimage; ( 2 ) Persian Gulf ; and (3) Ways and Means. The Persian Gulf Commission held three sittings, and in its Report to the Conference proposed the establishment of a large number of sanitary stations in and near the Gulf, in addition to drawing up a set of regulations applicable to arrivals in the Gulf ports. The sanitary stations proposed were as follows :— 1. At Eao, or in its neighbourhood, a large lazaret, on the mainland, with complete staff, having under its direction the sanitary posts' in the Gulf named below. 2 . On one of the islands, Salable* or Ylanie, opposite Basra, a small * The existing lazaret at Basra is lazaret, to supervise persons who on the island of Salahie. ma y have escaped the visit at Eao. 3.

Dr. 1 home reserved his opinion The only point, in the course of the discussion, to which he raised obieetion, was the question of a lazaret at l?ao. He asked if any member of the Commission had visited the spot, and added that the absence of anchorage, the soft consistency of the soil, the lack of good waler, and the feverish character of the locality constituted grave ° 'tIhs Report of the Commission was read to the full Conference at the fourth General Meeting (28th February 1894). The Report was accepted unanimously, with the understanding that any Delegation was still at liberty to raise objections, or to make reserves on a s no sequent occasion if they desired to do so. The British delegates made no obser- tions in the course of the brief discussion which followed on the presentation of tbe Report. . . ,, , It may be noted tliat, in the discussions ol the Commission (but nou in that of tbe full Conference) the American Delegation proposed an international sanitary station (similar to Camaran), near Cape Eas Massandoum at the entrance of the Gulf, and that Dr. Thorne I borne opposed the suggestion as being “ of a nature to annul in an unfortunate “ manner the good effects which we may justly anticipate froin the “ conclusions of the Commission. The creation of a large sanitary “ establishment at tbe entrance of tbe Gulf would incontestably “ interfere with {nuirait u) tbe establishment of the other posts just “ decided on.” In the Commission of Ways and Means, advantage was taken of the permission to recur to this subject which had been agreed upon when the Persian Gulf Commission’s Report was accepted by the Conference. Mr. Phipps, in this third Commission, made a declaration to the following elfectBritish or Rritish-Indian ships account for 98 per cent, of the maritime traffic in the Persian Gulf. Very few pilgrims reach the Hejaz by way of the Persian Gulf. The Secretary of State for India had no'information on the introduction of cholera into Persian Gulf ports by ships coming from India. Cholera, on the other hand, had frequently appeared on ships which for months together had never gone outside the Gulf. In the opinion of the British Delegation quarantine, or the establishment of sanitary posts, causing a delay to ships, should only be recommended in these shores when it had been proved that such measures were absolutely necessary, i.e., when it had been proved that, owing to their absence, disease had been introduced, and that if they had been present they might have prevented such introduction. The Government of India had information to the effect that no such necessity really existed. Mr. Phipps then briefly referred to the fact that all Indian ships had hills of health ; that the nine or ten posts proposed would be under at least four different Governments; that the Governments of Turkey and Persia would be too far away to exercise effective control over the posts; and that, in the end, the expense would he very great, it would fall almost exclusively on British shipping, and the measures proposed would only cause trouble and delay to shipping. Great Britain, he added, had ships of war constantly in the Gulf in the interests of local peace, and Residents in different points on the coast. “ She sees, therefore, no necessity to establish the “ proposed posts. She could not contribute to their maintenance from “ either Eritish or Indian revenues, and she would oppose any tax on “ her commerce for the establishment of posts which could not be “ rigorously controlled and which would probably be of no practicalEao was objected to by Mr. Phipps on the grounds that to detain ships there instead of at Basra would be very costly to shipping, as ships are permitted to operate in quarantine at the latter port, and this would be impossible at Fao. A detention at Mohamera would be equally objectionable. Briefly, the proposals to make Eao a principal sanitary station with either Mohamera or Basra as complementary station could not be accepted; but a proposal to make Mohamera and Basra “reciprocal” sanitary stations might be approved of. Under this last proposal ships and passengers for Mohamera could do their quarantine in that port and Persia ivould be protected ; while shins for Basra could proceed there, and, as at present, discharge in quarantine. Einally Mr. Phipps stated that he had only lightly touched on the political side of the question, but, he added, the Tur&lt;;o-Persian frontier delimitation was not. definitely settled by the Treaty of Erzeroum, and several points were still litigious or obscure. “ In establishing territorial “ rights at Mohamerah should we not have the appearance of settling “ questions that are perhaps rather thorny ?” These points were either not replied to, or only briefly controverted by M. Proust and others. The German delegate supported the con tention.that the danger of importation of cholera had been exaggerated, and pointed out that in 20 years cholera had been found on ships arriving in Basra from India in one instance only. After a brief dis cussion this aspect of the subject was dropped, and the Commission passed to other questions. ^ The objections of the British Delegation were summarised in the Beport of the Commission, which was read to the full Conference on 22nd March. They were mentioned, however, only to be rejected in favour of the original propositions. They were not raised again in the subsequent discussions. At the final meeting of the Conference on 3 rd April, for the purpose of signing the Convention, the British Delegation stated formally in the name of Her Majesty.that they were unable to accept Annexe III. of the Convention, in which the above proposals were incorporated. B .—Interval between the laris Conference of 1894 and the Venice Conference q/lSO?. The sanitary stations proposed by the Paris Convention of 1894 were not established; and the set of Regulations for the Persian Gulf ports contained in the same Convention were never put into practice. The execution of all these measures had been left to the Constantinople Board of Health, subject to an understanding between the Ottoman and Persian Governments as regarded the posts on the Persian shores of the Gulf.. Eor the next three years the sanitary arrangements in the Gulf remained a;S they were. The Board continued to impose vary in o* periods of quarantine, as each fresh occasion seemed to require it, in &amp; tke sole lazaret in those regions, that at Basra. When plague appeared in India in 1896 the Constantinople Board discussed at great length on repeated occasions the question of new posts and the regime to be applied in the Persian Gulf ports On 12 th January 1897 it was decided to repulse all ships from Basra havino* plague eases on board. At this discussion it was proposed to establish a sanitary camp at Eao after agreement with Persia and the Powers interested. The Vice-President (Ahmed Midhat Effendi) proposed that if lao proved insufficient the Board might send a trained staff to Bushire or Muscat to establish quarantine stations where all ships for the Gulf would be subjected to severe quarantine measures. ^ ttw* P ickson ol) j ected to a camp at Eao, as both banks of the Shatt- ul-Arab at that point do not belong to Turkey. ., A fortnight later it was announced that the Porte had abandoned the idea ot a temporary station at Pao, and decided on establishing- a permanent station there.

The Board also decided at this time that all ships from infected ports arriving in ports on the Nejd coast must he repulsed to Basra. This gave rise to a strong protest from the Vali, who feared that famine and disorders would result along the Neid coast, which is dependent on importations lor its supplies.. e therefore demanded the creation of a lazaret at Adjir. Adjir is the port of the Sandjak of Nejd. It lies on the S.W. coast ol the hay, in which are situated the Bahrein Islands. The Boaid of Heat consequently decided, on 23rd February, to instal a lazaiet here. A doctor, Kiatib, and three guards left Basra for Adjir on 10th March. Six months later it was reported that the Kiatih and one of the guards had died from fever, that another guard had deserted, and that the doctor was so ill that, with the remaining guard, he had, on his own responsibility, closed the lazaret and returned to Basra. From other sources it was learned, that the Adjir lazaret had served no practical purpose whatever. The death of two officials and the flight ot the rest, after only six months’ stay in that port, show clearly that the spot is utterly unsuited for the installation of a lazaret. The proposal to re-open a lazaret there was nevertheless made two years later, and will he vpfprrpH hplnw rOr&lt;nuiisation projetee des Services Snni- taires du Littoral du Nedjd.” 2nd-14th November 1897. “ Projet de creation d’une station quaran- tenaire avec lazaret dans FArcliipel Persart.” Rapport de M.M.

In the International Conference of 1897, the question of the Persian Gulf was considered by the first Commission, which dealt with “ Mesures de Prophylaxie hors d’Europe.” The only modifications made in the Begulations of 1894 for the Persian Gulf were the following :— {a) the period of incubation was put at 10 days for plague instead of seven for cholera; {b) healthy ships, to obtain free pratique, must have had a voyage of 10 days, as at Suez ; (c) observation of crew and passengers of suspected slops was made compulsory instead of being only “recommended.” As regards the posts to he established, France proposed to drop all the minor sanitary stations on the Persian and Arabian coasts suggested in 1894, and to have two posts only, one small station in the Straits of Ormuz (on Ormuz, Kishm or somewhere near) and one large one at Basra. All ships for the Gulf from an infected port were to call atOrmuz, where they would undergo a medical visit. If “ indemnes ” and 10 days out they were to receive pratique in the Gulf port of destination.^ If the 10 days were not completed they were to continue the voyage m quarantine, with guards on hoard. If plague cases were found on board at Ormuz, they were to be landed, and the ship if - «■&gt;»»&gt; Turkey again proposed a sanitary station at Fao, though of a temporary character, but the British delegate renewed his objections to Fao, and these were supported by M.

No iazaret has been established at the entrance to the Gulf, and the Basra lazaret remains, as. before, the sole, and very imperfect, quarantine station m those regions. ^ In the meanwhile, however, some sort of a station has, I believe, been established at Bushire, and the British Government has, on the reauest of the leheran Board of Health, lent the services of three qualified English medical men to Hie ports of Bender Abbas, Bushire and Mohamera. They are charged with executing in those ports the ’rules of the Venice Convention. On 11 th April 1899 a Mazbata from the Mutessarif of Neid was read to the Constantinople Board of Health, objecting to the quarantine which had been decreed against Bahrein, asking that a quarantine station be established at Bahrein, and claiming that island, as Turkish territory and part of the Mutessarifate of NejtL This gave rise to two alternative proposals, a new lazaret on Bahrein, or the re-openim* of the old lazaret at Adjir. On 4th May Hr. Hickson declared iu°the name of Her Majesty’s Government that Bahrein is independent and undti Biitisu piotection, and that Turkey could not therefore establish a lazaret or sanitary station of any kind there. He asked the Vice- President to communicate this statement to the Sublime Porte. On 20 th June a definite set of proposals was made, including the re-openmg of the Adjir lazaret, and posts ac Katar, Katif and Koweit. ’ The discussion on these proposals lasted several v r eeks. The British and French delegates protest eel against sanitary stations beino* established on the Nejd coast, as they had proved to be quite useless and very ^ * c Bus si a n delegate, on the other hand, stated that he had. - , • n r ,c '[Vni* on the immediate creation of a orders to ins.st in the na™e of the 1)r Dicks0:1 sta ted E‘S c ?Fvi' Sr i - i’av e le Conseil qu'il no pent, en nommer d’autres sur d’autres pomts “ du littoral °asdit, vu les engagements passes entre quelques chefs de “ la contree et ]e Gouvernemeat Britanmque, qui ne saurait y permettre “ une inference 6 trangere queloonquc. . The Turkish and the Russian and Persian delegates denied this contention, and declared that in their opinion the ^ ejd coast belongs exclusively to Turkey, and that they could recognise no other sovereignty on those coasts than that of the Sultan. The lazaret at Adjir was not, however, re-opened. The nomination of Dr. Borel to the post of Sanitary Officer at Basra in 1900, and the appearance of his detailed report on the sanitary defence of the Persian Gulf, are matters with which I have dealt else vvIig re. The proposal to establish sanitary stations in the Persian Gulf can only he justified on the assumption that their absence has enabled disease to enter the neighbouring countries, and pass by this route to Europe, m n mnrmpr* whioh it could not have done had such stations existed. This involves two questions :— (a) lias this route proved a real danger in the past ? (b) Would the sanitary stations proposed remove this danger, if danger there he, for the future ? In reply to the first question, the following are the only occasions on which plague or cholera has appeared iu the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf since 1897 :— Sultanate of Oman .—Two important (? imported) cases of plague in April 1899, at Mascat. Serious epidemic of cholera in the Sultanate in November 1899. Rumours that 70,000 persons had perished. Six cases of plague at Mattra in January 1900, followed by three or four suspicious cases. The French Vice-Consul telegraphed on 10th March that 30 deaths from plague had occurred iu Mattra in 10 days. Later details were as follows Deaths. Prom M arch 24-31 _ - 90 „ „ 31-April 7 - - - 70 „ April 8-14 - - 45 „ „ 15-21 - - - 28 Tne total mortality was estimated by the Prench Vice-Consul at 300 ; by an English Dr. Jeyakar at 600. On 17th April 1900 the French delegate on the Constantinople Board confirmed the presence of cholera in the Sultanate, stated that it had spread from Karachi to Gwadnr and Mascat, had invaded the interior, and spread among the coasts of Haclramuth towards Aden. Persia .—Outbreak of plague at Bushire in May-June 1899, over 40 deaths. Some cases also in Bender Dilem and at Task (? Jask). Outbreak of plague in March-April 1900 at Jivanrao in Persia and in many villages near, and also in Kermanshah and in many villages in the Suleimanie district (Turkish). There is good reason to believe that this was a revival of the endemic form of plague which has long existed in this part of Persia, and not due to an importation. In May ] 900, 18 cases and 11 deaths from plague in the island of Kishm.Basra District and Mesopotamia.—In October 1899 cholera was epi emie or the Sbatt-Ul-Arab between Basra and Eao, and spread some way into Mesopotamia. On 27th May 1899 the steamship Uaidari 5 ’ arrived at Basra, and two deaths trom plague occurred among its passengers. On 8 th February 1900 the steamship “ King Arthur ” arrived at A as ra with a case of plague already convalescent on board. She had been detained 11 days at Bushire. In Apiil-May 1901 11 cases of plague with 10 deaths occurred at Basra. Small outbreaks of plague occurred in Bagdad in May 1901 and in .January 1902, several sporadic cases of apparently ambulant plague occurring in the interval. ^ On 6 th March 1903 the steamship C£ Henry Bolckow ” arrived at Basra, having lost one of the crew from plague near Bender Abbas on 22 nd February. On 23rd December 1902 it was announced that cholera had appeared at Jatdv, near the entrance ot the Gulf. It also appeared at Bender Abbas and Minab, and many villages in the Jask neighbourhood. On 25th March 1903 the steamship “ Java ” arrived at Basra from Bombay, having lost one of the crew the day before from plague. In April-May 1903 outbreak of plague in Zobeir and Messayda, near the^ Tur c o - Persia n frontier, with 49 cases and 40 deaths. 1 inally, in July 1903, two deaths from plague in the island of Bahrein. From this brief resume the conclusion may justly be drawn that, though plague and cholera do from time to time gain entrance to the ports of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, and to some extent to the neighbouring countries, there does not seem to be any great danger of their spreading thence northwards and invading Europe. The first of the above two questions is therefore answered in the negative. The second question,—Would the sanitary stations proposed remove this danger, if danger there be, for the future ?—does not, consequently, require consideration. It will suffice to say that the incident of the Adjir lazaret alone seems a sufficient justification for the attitude hitherto adopted by His Majesty’s Government in rejecting the establishment of similar stations elsewhere in the Gulf. The above considerations may help to guide the British Delegation as to the attitude to adopt, should, as seems likely, the proposals°of 1894, those of 1897, or other proposals of a similar kind, be brought forward in the Conference now sitting. A. —Should the proposals of 1894 be revived it would seem clear that no lazaret can, under any circumstances, be admitted at Fao; and that should the other sanitary stations suggested be again proposed, they should be rejected for the reasons clearly expressed by the British delegates in that year. B. —Should, on the other hand, the proposals of 1897 be revived (as seems more probable) the following seem to be the most important points to be borne in mind :— His Majesty’s Government has accepted the proposal for a sanitary station in the Straits of Ormuz. The difficulties arise when the mode of establishing this station and the authority entrusted with its control come to be considered. The Persian and Turkish Governments are both concerned in this question. Persia has accepted the proposal for a station at the mouth of the Gulf under the conditions already stated. His Majesty’s Government agreed to those conditions, namely that the flag and armed guards were to be Persian, while suggesting, however, that no armed guards of any kind were necessary. (Confidential Paper 7,324, No. 131.) 14048. COn the question of a staiion on Persian territory being controlled by the Constantinople Board of Health, the India Office at first raised serious objections, as being likely to give the Arab tribes the impress,on that Turkey controlled the entire Gulf. They urged the desirability of ^nivot-.iinJnrr iw«in,n authoritv over tho station.- But the India Oince the station. v But the India Office at the same time stated that the question was one to he settled rather by the Foreign Office than by them. The Foreign Office did not apparently, share the apprehensions as to tho effect on the of ffiviiur control of the Ormuz station to the Constantinople Bo ard of maintaining Persian authority over * Confidential Paper 7,109, No. 139. Confidential Paper 7,370, 2s 0. 1, and others. It may be added that, if a station is to be established at Ormuz, there seems to he no other body than the Constantinople Board of Health to which its control could he entrusted. A proposal to put it under the Teheran Board of Health need not seriously he considered, as that Board has neither the funds nor the energy needed. A proposal to establish a third body to control the Ormuz station would not probably meet with approval, as a similar proposal has already been objected to on the grounds that a new Board would multiply the troublesome incidents already caused by those existing. In 1898 the Indian Government proposed lending an Indian medical officer as director of the station at the entrance of the Gulf, by agree ment with the Constantinople Board of Health. Colonel Meade, acting Polhical Resident in the Persian Gulf, stronsly approved; and thought, if this could not be arranged, that His Majesty’s Government should insist that; the head of the station should, at any rate, he an Englishman. Hr. Dickson thought the Constantinople Board of Health would never consent to an Indian Government officer as director, and urged that the Indian Government, with the consent of Persia, should itself establish and administer a lazaret, and then ask the Porte to name an Ottoman delegate to be added to the staff. C. Should an entirely new set of proposals he made, the following considerations might he borne in mind :— Great Britain still has the overwhelming preponderance in shipping in the Gulf. In the six years 1896—1902 the proportion of British shipping in the Turkish ports of the Gulf (Basra and Fao) varied from 70’8 to 77*3 per cent. Turkish shipping in the same period varied from 10'06 to 20'08 per cent. Shipping of all other European flags together varied from P98 to 4T3 per cent. I have no exact information on the proportion of British shipping in the Persian ports ; hut in official correspondence on this subject in recent years, the proportion of British shipping in all the Gulf ports has been repeatedly spoken of a^ exceeding 90 per cent, of the total. As it has increased rather than diminished in the Turkish ports in the last six years, there is no reason to believe that it has dimished in the Turkish and Persian ports together. It would seem therefore justifiable to continue to state that British shipping accounts for over 90 per cent, of the total shipping in the Gulf. With regard to the individual ports in the Gulf, it would be important to hear in mind the following definite statements, contained in a Despatch from Lord Salisburv to Sir N. It. 0 Conor, dated 5 th July 1899 : “ • • • • it does not seem necessary or expedient that a Turkish sanitary station should he permitted to be establised at El Katar, a port which has never been formally admitted by His Majesty’s Government to be under the sovereignty of Turkey .... With regard to Aoweit, His Majesty’s Government cannot countenance the theory of Turkish Protectorate. It is considered by His Majesty’s Government that the presence in the Persian Gull of Turkish war vessels should he deprecated.“With regard to Adjir, the idea of establishing a lazaret at that place comes under the same objection to admitting Turkish authority there.’’ ^ In regard to Bahrein, His Majesty’s Government has on other occasions expressed similar views. In 1899 the Government of India offered the services of an Indian Assistant-Surgeon to the Sheikh of Bahrein, bnt the latter replied that he was himself doing what was necessary and the Government of India did not push the proposal further. (Conhdential Paper 7568, Ho 16). The above are the principal ports of the Arabian coast. On the Persian coast, the ports of Mohamera, Bushire, Bender Abbas (and ? Lin gab) are provided with a medical officer lent by the Indian Government to the Persian Government, and so far as shipping or sanitary interests are concerned, I am not aware that any views have been expressed by His Majesty’s Government as to the need for any change in the sanitary arrangements of these ports. The question of a sanitary station at the entrance to the Gulf has been dealt with at length above. There remain to be briefly considered the questions of Basra itself and the Shatt-Ul-Arab. The present lazaret at Basra is extremely defective. The Board has recently decided to remove it to a suitable spot at Kut-El-JDjou, on the left bank of the river, nearly opposite the town of Basra. This site has been strongly approved of by His Majesty’s Consul at Basra. Frequent attempts have been made to remove the lazaret further down the river, but we have always strongly and successfully protested agiinst such proposals. Something of the nature of a lazaret exists at Mohamera, but is believed to serve no real purpose. Sanitary smuggling between Mohamera and Basra is of daily occurence, but these and other matters have been already dealt with in my notes to Dr. Borel’s Beport. Paris, P. G. Clemow. 20th October 1903. Enclosure Ho. 2. India Office to Foreign Office. B, &amp; S. 2821. India Office, Sir, 14th Hovember 1903. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 31st October 1903, inviting his observations on a memorandum by Dr. Clemow on sanitary measures in the Persian Gulf, which he has prepared for the guidance of the British Delegation in case the question should be brought forward in the International Sanitary Conference now sitting at Paris. In reply I am to make the following observations. Dr. Clemow’s conclusion that the Persian Gulf route has not in the past proved a real danger to Europe as regards plague or cholera is concurred in by the Secretary of State for India, and as the existence of such a danger is made the ground for placing the sanitary regulation of the Gulf under international control and for demanding precautions in excess of purely local requirements, I am to suggest that the facts supporting Dr. Clemow’s conclusion should be strongly pressed by the British Delegation in any discussion of the question in the Conference. Should the proposals of 1894 he revived, Dr. Ciemow’s view that the establishment of sanitary stations at Fao or at any of the ports on the Arabian side of the Gulf should not be assented to by the British Delegation should, in the opinion of Mr. Brodrick, be acted on. Should on the other hand the proposals of 1897 be revived, and the establishment of a sanitary station at Ormuz, or at some adjacent placeon the Persian coast, by the Sanitary ttetrit^b nronosed it is desirable that endeavour should be made by the jdut.sti Delegation to defeat the project by dwellms on its inutility from a Snitmv point of view and on the obstructions to commerce which it must necessarily occasion. It is true that His Majesty's Government accepted the proposal of the Venice Convention for a sanitary station at Ormuz. But since 1897 the practical difficulties of giving effect to the stipulation of the Convention regarding it ami ol securing an agiecnien on P the point between the Persian and the Ottoman Governments have proved insurmountable, while experience has shown that the measures alreadv in force at Persian ports are amply sufficient for the safety or the Persian littoral. If, however, the Conference should decide that a sta tion is reqaired at or near Ormuz, the necessary arrangements can best he carried out by the sanitary authorities charged with t.ie protection of the Persian ports, and not by the Ottoman Sanitary Board. Ine British Delegation might be instructed to press for this. Should an entirely new set of proposals be made at the Conieience. Dr. Clemow lias accurately stated the main considerations which should cruide the British Delegation. It is desirable that any such proposals should be referred for examination to His Majesty’s Government and to the Indian Government before the British delegates commit themselves in any way to acceptance of them.

I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 11th November 1903, forwarding a leport, No. 12, dated 7th November, by the British delegates at the Paris Sanitary Conference regarding certain points on which they desire instructions. It is understood that the points have been discussed between the medical advisers of the Local Government Board and Mr. de Bunsen and Dr. Clemow, at a meeting at which a representative of this Office was present, and Mr. Brodrick is content to leave the decision of the several technical questions dealt with under the head of “ General technical conclusions and the rat question,” to the Foreign Office. With regard to the Persian Gulf question, I am to refer you to the letter B. and S. 2821 of 14th instant, and to suggest that the proposal which, it is understood, is to he made to the Conference, that the Mixed Commission be invited to provide funds for the construction of a lazaret at Ormuz, should he opposed by the British delegates. The cost of constructing and maintaining the station would he very considerable, and would operate as an impost on shipping, while experience has shown that the station is not required for the sanitary protection of the Gulf. A much more urgent matter for the consideration of the Constantinople Board of Health is the improvement of their sanitary station at Bussorah, which has been frequently reported to he inadequately maintained. \&gt; ith regard to the project for the establishment of an International Health Bureau, I am to say that, in the absence of information as to the purpose which the Bureau is intended to serve, or of evidence that it is required, the Secretary of State for India is of the opinion of the^Delegates that it is a project which had better stand oyer for subsequent discussion through diplomatic channels. mi xr •. o, I have, &amp;c., Ihe Unaer Secretary of State, a.

The practical work of the Sanitary Conference came to an end with the sixth plenary meeting, held on Wednesday last the 18th instant. We are now awaiting the text of the draft Convention, which is to embody all the four previous Conventions, with the modifications and additions resulting from the labours of the present Conference. A small Committee has been named, which will control and, where necessary, correct the text of the new Convention before the Conference finally meets, for its signature, on Monday, 30th November. We are desirous of obtaining your Lordship’s instructions in the matter of our signing the Convention. Another day or two may still * c- t , elapse before we are able to for- Smce drafting the above, the text has j . been received and we are forwarding it under U . 1 , , &gt; t)Ut we think it separate cover. ~ desiranle not to delay any longer, and to summarise at once °the results obtained by the present Conference, to point out to what extent British interests would gain or lose by the acceptance of the Convention and to indicate the reasons which induce us to hope that vour LorrLhin will authorise us to accept and sign it. ^ ^P It will be most convenient to consider, firstly, the principal modi fications in existing Conventions, and secondly, the additions to those instruments which are embodied in the new Convention. We shall in 14048. j)pnoli in stance indicate our views as to the acceptability, or the reverse, of he P^ nt ia question. We shall then point oat, as briefly as ol the point ' British interests of accepting, or St ng he^w Convention as a whole, and the considerations which, in onr opinion, render the former course the more desirable of the two. Modifications in existing Conventions.—We shall nllude here only to the principal modifications—only, that is, to modifications of such importance 11 ^ to hear weight in the question of our signing the C °Tbe reduction of the incubation period of plague from ten to five days has lead to important modifications m many parts or the Con vention of 1S97; and these modifications everywhere result m gams, both in the sense of reducing delays and obstacles to shipping and e movements of passengers, and also m the sense of approximating to t liberal views alwavs upheld by Great Britain in regard to the pro phylaxis of disease. It suffices, in this connection, to point to the reduction from twelve to seven days of the date ot the last case m the definitions of “ infected ” and “ suspected ” ships respectively, ^and the reduction in the periods of “ observation” and “ surveillance on such ships. It is true that the reductions in the latter periods were not so great as we could have wished, or as they should, logically, have been, in view of the reduction of the incubation period. But such change as has been made is a reduction, and therefore a gain both to commerce and to British views. ... 1C „ The recognition that no class of goods is in itself . susceptible ot carry in ^ disease, and the consequent marked reduction in the list of articles' 5 which may he prohibited admission to a country, are also distinct gains in the interests of commerce and of common sense in disease prophylaxis. . . . Other modifications introduced which are, in our opinion, very considerable gains in the same direction are the following :— The acceptance of the medical visit at night for ships passing the Suez Canal. The notification of a first case of piagueor cholera, even if indigenous, not to involve the application of measures. Pilgrim ships belonging to countries which have accepted the Con ventions to he allowed, under certain specified conditions, to transit the Suez Canal, without preliminary detention at Tor. The acceptance, in principle, of the transit of Egypt in train, “ en contumace,” by passengers and mails from the East. • The end of an epidemic to date from the isolation (where isolation has been effected), instead of from the cure or death of the last case. Additions to existing Conventions. The most important additions are those resulting from the formal decision that the rat is a danger in the spread of plague. This has naturally led to the introduction of certain restrictive measures which found no place in any previous Convention. But this result was inevitable from the first. It was, indeed, to be feared that much more stringent measures would have been insisted upon than those finally adopted ; and we confess to something like relief, that we have not now to report to your Lordship the introduction of much more drastic measures, to meet the rat danger, than those embodied in the draft Convention. These measures may be briefly summarised as follows :— In the classification of ships as “ infected,” “suspected,” or “clean,” human plague is alone to he considered, in spite of the proposal to put rat-plague on the same level as human plague for this purpose. In regard to human plague on ships, rat destruction is compulsory on “infected” ships. It is recommended on “suspected” ships. It isfacultative, but not to be applied as a general rule, on “clean” ships. (We do not repeat here the conditions, already reported, attached to these various decisions.) In icgard to rat-plague on clean ships, rat destruction is compulsory on ships on board which rat-plague is known to exist. It is facultative (i.e., applied “if judged necessary”) on ships on board which an unusual rat mortality has been observed. In regard to rat-plague on shore, it is not to be notifiable, in the absence of human plague. In the presence of human plague, rat-plague, if existent, is to be notified at the same time as the human disease; and, in subsequent reports on the progress of the epidemic, and at its end, the measures taken to control rat-plague are also to be reported. In. considering the acceptability of the above decisions, we are guided by the following considerations :— t he decisions as they stand are not only much less drastic than we anticipated they would he before entering on the work of this Conference, but are considerably less so than the measures actually proposed to the Conference. The reduction in stringency of the measures proposed was brought about during the discussions largely to meet our views. We do not say “ wholly 3 to meet our views, because on many points our views were fully shared by the Kussian and other Delegations. But on not a few points alterations were made solely to meet our wishes. We admit that on some points—notably on those connected with rat destruction on healthy ships—we were not able to gain all that we wished. But we venture to assert that, under the circumstances, and in view of the opinions held by the other Delegations, nothing better could be obtained than the compromise actually arrived at; and we cannot but think that the conclusions concerning rat-plague and rat destruction might be safely accepted hj His Majesty’s Government as they stand. Some further considerations, which have assisted us in coming to this conclusion, will be dealt with in a later part of this Despatch/ We have already expressed at length our opinions as to the accepta bility of the new or modified decisions respecting the followino*:—The Constantinople, Alexandria, and Tangier Boards of Health, the Inter national Sanitary Bureau, and the Persian Gulf; and on all of these questions we are now in possession of your Lordship’s instructions. In regard to the Tangier Sanitary Board we note that we are jt r it a * 7 ? i !-&gt; i , instructed* to “ make a reserve * Lord Lansdowne to British Delegates, -ji -i ; No. 1 1 , of 17th November 1903. o\ ith icgord to the provision of “ the necessary funds, basing it on “ the principle that every country is bound, generally speaking, to “ defray the expenses considered by the Government necessary for 3 the “ preservation of the national health.” These instructions reached us too late to act upon them in any meeting of the Conference, and we therefore venture to ask whether your Lordship would still wish us to make a formal reserve on this matter, when signing the Convention on the 30th instant, as was done in regard to the Persian Gulf and other questions, when signing the Paris Convention of 1891. We are ourselves of opinion^ that, as nothing passed at the Conference indicating that it was intended that the cost of the Morocco lazaret should fall on shipping, it would be better not now to call attention to the point, and to reserve it to be dealt with by diplomatic means if, in the event, it should be proved that our shipping is realty threatened. We have set forth at some length the above modifications and additions to the existing Conventions which must result from the adoption of the new Convention, in order that your Lordship mav be in a position to judge of the acceptability or non-acceptahility of the new Convention as a whole. We venture to state that, iu our opinion, after balancing the gains and losses of the present Conference, the net result is an advance, as compared with former Conventions, in the direction ofBritish views as to disease-proplijlaxis, while, in regard to commeicial kiterests, shipping is a distinct gainer in some direct.cns and, if a loser in otliers, is so to a far less extent than was anticipated Mould he t . mse before the work of the Conference began. ^We proceed, in conclusion, to consider the practical results which J y hJcxpectcd to follow the acceptance or the rejection of the present C The^neral political advantages which the unanimous acceptance of an international instrument of this kind presents, and the unfortunate impression which might result from its rejection, or even from its acceptance with reserves on important points, by Gi eat Britain, are matters upon which it is unnecessary to dwell at length, they aie factors which cannot he lost sight of in a review of all the considerations for and against the acceptance of the Convention. There are other advantages presented by accepting the Convention, and disadvantages m its rejection, which we proceed to point out. . ... Should the existing Conventions remain in force, the position m regard to rat-measures would he distinctly less iavouranle, m our ophiion, than it would he under the terms of the new Convention Under existing conditions the Powers arc under no agreement ol^any kind in regard to rat destruction. Each country, therefore, feels hsck more or less free to impose what measures it thinks fit. The result is an entire lack of uniformity in the measures imposed, great uncertainty for shipping as to the restrictions they may he called upon to unoeigo in a new port of arrival, and unnecessarily stringent measures in cert ain countries. It will suffice, in this connection, to point to the recent Erench decree, making rat destruction compulsory on all ships from infected ports, and to the Turkish “ reglement ” dealing with the same matter. The acceptance of the new Convention would at least substitute order for disorder; it would establish a maximum of rat measures, and would give ships the right—which they do not now possess—of claiming compensation whenever a port authority should go beyond that maximum. We may think this maximum placed at a higher point than we would have wished, hut we would repeat that it is very much lower than we had anticipated, and very much lower than is now adopted in some countries. In those countries, at least, British shipping would gain considerably by the aceeptance of the new Convention. We would point out that the iat measures are very distinctly limited and defined by the draft Convention. Thus, they are not to cause damage to goods or ships; their application is not to last more than 24 hours in certain cases, 48 hours in other cases. None of these restrictions exist in any international agreement at present; and they are not always respected in practice. We could have wished that less latitude had been left to a port authority in the matter of rat destruction on healthy ships from infected ports ; and that the power had not been left to port authorities to send ships to another port for the purpose of rat destruction. But we are far from thinking these points of sufficient importance to justify the rejection of the new Convention. In regard to the latter point—the power to repulse a ship to another port—it will he useful to point out what are the provisions of existing conventions and how they work out in practice. Under existing Con ventions contracting countries must provide on every seaboard at least one port furnished with the means for “ dealing with a ship, whatever may he its sanitary condition.” Under these circumstances, ships destined for a country where they would be liable to sanitary measures go direct to the port where the means for applying these measures are Known to exist, instead of going first to their port of destination, only to he repuhed to the fully equipped pore. Eor example, a ship from Bombay bound for Toulon would go first to Marseilles. These pro in regard to v — — — first to Marseilles. visions, and this practice, will remain exactly the same,ordinary sanitary measures, under the new as under the old Convention, rrvf a ^ ew ^f' c ^ or h as ^een introduced in the measures of rat destruction. Ihese do not apply to ships from cholera-infected ports, which will, there- iore, he unaffected hy these new dispositions. In regard to ships from pJague-mfected ports, the two classes of “infected” and “suspected” strips are m any case subject to ordinary sanitary measures, and the addition ot rat destruction to these does not affect the question of their repulsion to another port. In regard to the class of “ indemnes” ships, these are also liable under existing rules to repulsion, in order 'to un e^o t le measuies of disinlection of linen, &amp;c. The new Convention introduces no new measures in making such ships liable to repulsion. It only adds rat destruction to the disinfection of linen, &amp;c., for which such repulsion may become necessary. It was foreseen by the Con ference that m some countries several ports might exist with means for applying ordinary sanitary measures (though only one is obligatory), hut that not all of them would have the means for applying rat destruction. Ships repulsed with the latter object would therefore be under a disadvantage as compared with those repulsed with the former. It v as uO meet this difficulty that it was agreed to recommend that all laige pmts should he provided with means for rat destruction. We venture to think that this may to some extent meet the difficulty. It v as in an\ case the best that could be obtained, and it would, in our opinion, be very undesirable to make this point a reason for reiectin 0 * the Convention as a whole. Pinally, we may point out that the rejection of tiie Convention would involve the rejection of the advantages gained in recard to the list of goods which may he prohibited; the medical visit at night in Esypt; the application of measures for a first case of plague or cholera; the passage of the Suez Canal, under certain conditions, bv pilgrim ships, without detention at Tor; the transit of Egypt in quarantine trains * and the addition of “isolation ” to the “cure ” or “ death” of the last case in determining the end of an epidemic. To these points we have referred in an earlier part of this Despatch. We have, &amp;c.. The Marquess of Lansdowne, K.G., (for British Delegates) &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. M. de Bunsen.

Annex 2. British Delegates, Paris, to Foreign Office. Xo 1 7 Paris, TVl Lord* 19th December 1903. ^ We have the honour to acknowledge your Lordship s telegraphic despatch of the l?th instant, instructing us to endeavour to obtain lor the Persian Gulf question a decision similar to that obtained concerning the question of the International Sanitary Bureau; or. jn the event of this being unattainable, to accept the resolution of the ^Vays and Means Committee as it now stands, subject to the reserve we had already made in that Committee on the subject of the Mixed Commission and the reduction of Turkish sanitary dues. _ After careful consideration of the two alternatives, we were led to die unanimous conclusion that a proposal to defer the question of a lazaret at Ormuz to subsequent diplomatic treatment by the Powers would have had no chance of success. In the case of the. International Sanitary Bureau, the matter at issue was one in which diplomatic considerations clearly outweighed sanitary considerations ; it was an. entirely new proposal, on which no previous decision had been arrived at by earlier Conferences ; and the argument that such a proposal was scarcely within the competence of the Conference to decide, and would he better left to subsequent diplomatic treatment, Avas one which could he justly, and was successfully, used. But these arguments could not he advanced in the case of the proposed lazaret at Ormuz. In this case, even if diplomatic out weighed sanitary considerations, it would have been most undesirable to say so. Moreover, the fact that previous Conferences had come to decisions on this question, decisions which, in the case of the lb97 Conference, Her Majesty’s Government had accepted, prevented us from using the argument that it was beyond the competence of the present Conference to deal with the matter. On these considerations, we felt compelled to act upon the second alternative, contained in your Lordship’s telegram, and to state that we were authorised to accept the resolutions of the Ways and Means Committee, subject to the reserve above referred to. In doing so, however, we took the opportunity, as desired by your Lordship, of pointing out that the experience of the last six years had shown that the danger anticipated from the absence of a lazaret at Ormuz had been in no way realised; that the climate of those regions and their great distance from the centres of government were very unfavourable conditions for the establishment of a lazaret; and that the disastrous results which followed the opening of the Adjir lazaret—the only one yet opened in the Gwlf—might well he borne in mind in considering the proposal to establish a similar institution at Ormuz. We concluded by* saying that if, in spite of these considerations, we accepted the resolution of the Ways and Means Committee (subject to the reserve alluded to) it was because His Majesty's Government were desirous not to dissociate themselves from the other Powers in the conclusions of the present Conference.The statement was not followed by any discussion. Monsieur Barrere, the President, merely remarked that it would appear in full in the printed procds-verbaux of the Conference. We shall forward to your Lordship, as soon as received, the verbal of yesterday’s meeting at which the above statement was made.

India Office, Sir, 27th November 1903. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 25th November 1903 on the subject of the draft Convention prepared by the Paris Sanitary Conference. In reply I am to say that Mr. Brodrick concurs in Lord Lansdowne’s proposal to give the British delegates the requisite authority to sign the Convention, subject to reservations on certain points. The Board of Trade and the Licil Government Board will doubtless advise whether any reservations are required regarding the provisions which deal with the subject of rats, and I am to say that the Secretary of State for India is content to leave this point to those authorities. With regard to the Persian Gulf I am to say that in the opinion of Mr. Brodrick a reservation should bo made respecting any provision of the Convention which invites the Mixed Commission to provide funds for establishing a sanitary station at Ormuz, or which otherwise approves the establishment of such a station at that place. I am to refer to my letter B. &amp; S. 2925, dated 17th November 1903, on the subject. I have, &amp;c., The Under Secretary of State, A. Godley. Eoreign Office. Enclosure No. 7.

Eoreign Office, 4th December 1903. Annex. Eoreign Office to British Delegates, Sanitary Conference, Paris. No. 17. Foreign Office, Gentlemen, 1st December 1903. I have received your Despatches Nos. 17-27, of the 19th, 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 26th and 27th ultimo, reporting the further proceedings oi the International Sanitary Conference assembled at Paris.In your Despatch No. 27 of the 2 l 7th ultimo you state that the actual'signing of the Convention, which is to take place on the 3rd instant, will be preceded hy a sitting of the full Conference, and t hat this sitting will afford an opportunity for placing again on record, it desired, any of the reserves which you have attached to your acceptance of the conclusions of the Conference. , , ,. T In order to remove any possibility of future misunderstanding, 1 consider it of importance that, as a general rule, any reserves made in Conference should, if they affect the interpretation placed by His Maiestv’s Government on the language of the Convention, or limit the extent ^of their acceptance of the stipulations of the Convention, be repeated at, and duly recorded in the protocol of the final sitting of the Conference, that is, on the occasion of the signing of the Convention. Unless this procedure he observed there is an appreciable risk that the qualifications attached bv His Majesty s Government to their obligations may he lost sight of and “forgotten, particularly when the proems verbaux of the proceedings are voluminous or defective. In the present instance the extent and 'complicated nature of the discussions in the various Committees, and the rapidity with which the work has been despatched render the observance of this precaution highly desirable. As regards the proposal for the establishment of an International Bureau, I concur with you that the addition of the conclusions of the Conference on tiiis head, as an annex to the Convention, make it essential that your reserve should be repeated before the Convention is signed. The Persian Gulf question is another in respect of which too much care cannot be taken to make clear the precise nature of the obligation undertaken by you on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, especially as the text of the Convention dealing with the proposed establishment of a sanitary station on the Island of Ormuz, and, in particular, with regard to the method for providing funds for the purpose, is not altogether free from ambiguity. I therefore request that you will repeat the declaration made at the sixth full sitting of the Conference, and also add to it a statement to the effect that it must be understood that:— ( 1 .) The Convention shall not he open to the construction that it is incumbent on the Mixed Commission to find the funds from the accumulations of past years or from any other source, except with the assent of all the delegates on the Mixed Commission. (2.) The establishment shall be deferred until the Board of Health at Constantinople has been reformed in the manner provided by the Convention. You should also make a declaration with regard to the British Dominions beyond the Seas, and request that it may he inserted in the protocol of signature. As India and the Straits Settlements have not yet decided to accede at once, as in the case of the Convention of 1897, you should declare that the present Convention will not be applicable to any of the Colonies, Possessions, or Protectorates of His Britannic Majesty until a notification to that effect shall have been made to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the French Republic by His Britannic Majesty’s Representative at Paris, on behalf of such Colony, Possession or Protectorate. I assume that before the text of the Convention is finally settled a stipulation will have been introduced, similar to that in the Venice Convention, providing that the arrangement will remain in force for successive periods of five years each, subject to termination on notice given six months before the conclusion of any of these periods, and that power will be reserved to the High Contracting Parties to bring about through the diplomatic channels, any modifications which they may consider necessary to introduce in the Convention or its Annexes.Subject to the foregoing' instructions, I authorise you to sign the Convention on behalf of His Majesty’s Grovernnient.

It is perhaps fitting that we should submit to your Lordship m a imai despatch a general statement of the results obtained, and of our attitude with regard to the various questions dealt with. ^ . The Conference was attended hy delegations from the following 23 Powers: Germany, Argentine Bepublic, Austria-Hungaiy, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Spain, United States, Prance, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, Luxemburg, Montenegro, Holland, Persia, Portugal, Roumania, Pussia, Servia, Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, and Turkey. In the British delegation India, and in the Turkish Dele gation Egypt, were represented hy separate Delegates. With few exceptions every Power was represented hy both diplomatic and technical Delegates. 4 - t The opening meeting of the Conference was held on the 10th October, and the closing meeting, at which the Convention was signed, took place on the 3rd December. In all seven plenary meetings were held ; but the detailed work of the Conference was done in Committee. Three Committees were appointed, and it will be most convenient to discuss the different questions as near as may he in the order in which they were dealt with by those Committees. The three Committees were :— (A) The Ways and Means Committee. (B) The Technical Committee. (C) The Codification Committee. (A) Questions dealt with hy the Ways and Means Committee. ]. The Constantinople Board of Health. The need for reorganising this body was admitted hy all the dele gations, with the exception of the Turkish. The proposals that the Turkish members should he reduced to four; that the two Inspectors should he named hy the Board itself; that Poumania should be repre sented on the Board'; that the non-Ottoman Delegates should fulfil certain conditions as to nationality, medical qualification, or Vice-Consular rank; and that the decisions of the Board should be binding on the j - - ^ ^ KS Ottoman Government, were accepted almost with unanimity. The Turkish delegation, however, declined even to discuss, much less to accept, any of these various proposals. In regard to our own attitude on this question, we fully shared the general opinion as to the need for reforms, and we accepted without reserve the above proposals, save that, in. respect of the last, wemaintained the view always held by His Majesty’s Government that the Constantinople^ Board of Health is an Ottoman institution, though under international control, and that the Ottoman Government is ultimately responsible for the measures that may be taken in the sanitary defence of the Turkish Empire. 2 . The Tangiers Sanitary Board. W (3 v ere able to associate ourselves unreservedly with the following “ vceux ” expressed by the Conference That the Tangiers Board should apply the decisions of the International Sanitary Conventions; that the Morocco pilgrimage should he properly supervised ; and that a lazaret should be established in a suitable spot near Tangiers, as for example, at Malabata. 3. The Bed Sea, Suez Canal, and the Alexandria Board. A proposal was made by ourselves, and supported by the Egyptian Delegates, that the medical visit on ships passing the Suez Canal should be allowed to take place at night, as well as by day. This proposal was accepted, in so far as it is to apply to first and second class, but not to third-class passengers. The visit is also to be permitted to take place on board the ship (and not, as before, compulsorily on shore), provided that the third-class passengers do not subsequently leave the ship. The Egyptian delegation further proposed that pilgrim ships from Hedjaz should henceforth be allowed to transit the Canal without a preliminary detention at Tor. This proposal, however, met with opposition, and was therefore withdrawn!. It w r as revived, in a slightlv modified form, by the Bussian delegation, but was again rejected. Ultimately it w r as agreed that pilgrim ships belonging to those nations which shall have accepted the present and the previous Conventions shall be allowed to transit the Canal without detention at Tor, if they fulfil certain conditions. These conditions are stated at lenMh in Article CXLIII. of the Convention. Thvo proposals were made respecting the powers and attributions of the Alexandria Maritime, Sanitary, and Quarantine Board. The first avas made by the Italian delegation, and v T as to the effect that the Board should cease to have any concern wdth the internal sanitary affairs of Egypt, and that these should be left entirely to the Govern ment of His Highness the Khedive. The second was made by the Egyptian delegation, and was to the effect that both the internal and external sanitary control of Egypt should be confided to one Govern ment body, the International Board at Alexandria confining itself to the task of furnishing information to the European Governments on the couise of sanitary affairs in those regions. TVh supported both proposals, but both wrnre rejected, and no alteration has been made in the powers or attributions of the Board. TI e should here call your Eordship s attention to the unanimous and warm tribute paid by the Conference to Dr. Buffer, for his conduct of affairs as President of that Board. ^TTie.Egyptian delegation further proposed that the passage by train of. mails and passengers from contaminated countries should be per mitted across Egypt, under conditions which had been already submitted to the Alexandria Board, and which were repeated to the Conference. This proposal was accepted by the Conference, and the regulation for the transit of Egypt in quarantine by train forms Annex 1 of the new Convention. d. The Sanitary Defence of the Persian Gulf. The decisions on this question are a repetition of those of the Venice Sanitary Convention of 1897, with certain modifications and additions. They are, as before, grouped under two headings— thesanitary regime to be applied, and the sanitary posts to be established, ^The^L in the Gulf has been modified by a reduction from tento five days in the period of observation in the ease of suspected ships, and in the length of voyage from an mfectedpoi , after w neh healthy ship shall be entitled to free pratique. W e should also note that the Conference has recognised that a sanitary service now exists at Bushire. The clause in the Convention permitting ships to Opel a e there no longer contains tlm words “ lorsqu’une installation samta.ro convenafaltt y aura ete etabl.e. , ,. i i • n. n lP -Hip With regard to the sanitary posts to be establisued m the vj 1 , t decisions of tlie Venice Convention have been modified m the following manner •—The new Convention provides, as did the former one, for two lazarets ! one at the entrance of the Gulf and one in the neighbourhood of Bussorah. But the Island of Ormuz is now definitely named as the site of the former. The Constantinople Board of Health is given the same powers over the Ormuz lazaret as over that at Bussorah. It is further charged with finding the funds needed for its installation, and, it is added, that the Mixed Commission for the Revision of the Sanitary maviir clinnlfl moet as soon as nossible, to authorise the advance ot the funds from the Board’s reserves. _ . , ^ . . We would point out here that in the article giving the Constantinople Board authority to establish and control the Ormuz lazaret, the clause contained in the former Convention—“ Pour la station d’Ormuz une “ entente sera etablie entre le Gouvernement Ottoman et le Gouverne- “ ment Persan”—has been suppressed. That “entente” had, it was thought, been arrived at in the interval between the two Conventions, Persia not objecting to the lazaret being built and controlled, and its staff named, by the Constantinople Board, provided that the flag and the armed guards were Persian. But this view was shown to he incorrect by the unqualified declaration of the Turkish delegation, at the filth plenary meeting, that no such “entente” existed, and that Turkey regarded the proposal that the lazaret should fly the Persian flag as inadmissible. The second part of that declaration called forth an energetic protest from the Persian delegation. Our attitude on these various points was based on the following considerations:— The proposals to establish lazarets at (or near) Ormuz and Bussorah constructed and controlled by the Constantinople Board were accepted by Her Majesty’s Government at the Venice Conference of 1897. We were, further, well aware of the correspondence that had since passed on this subject, and of the apprehensions expressed by the Government of India lest a Turkish lazaret at Ormuz should give the tribal inhabitants of the Gulf shores the impression that Turkey had the political control of the whole Gulf. On the purely sanitary side of the question, we were of opinion that the need for a lazaret at the entrance to the Gulf had not been demon strated. On the contrary, the experience of the last seven years has shown that the absence of such a lazaret has not, as it was feared it would, proved a clanger, and that, though plague and cholera have repeatedly been introduced to the Gulf shores, they have not extended beyond those shores and invaded Europe. The disastrous experience which followed the opening of the Adjir lazaret—the only one as yet opened in those regions—was also fresh in our minds, as an object- lesson of the extreme unsuitability of the climatic and other conditions lor a lazaret in those waters, and of the danger of establishing an institution of the kind so far away from the centres from which it must he controlled. On all these grounds the establishment of a lazaret at Ormuz appeared not only uncalled for but inexpedient. On the other hand, we were no less conscious that a reversal of the attitude adopted by HerMajesty s Government in 1897 on this question must of necessity create an unfavourable impression. These considerations were discussed at length at Conferences held at the horeign Office, Local Government Board, and India Office, at which two of our number were present. The possibility was not lost sight of that an unreserved acceptance of the proposal would not of necessity be followed by the construction of the lazaret—just as its (almost un- icseiwed) acceptance in 1897 had not been. This possibility was strengthened by the refusal of Turkey to allow the lazaret to fly the Persian flag, and the absence of an ‘’entente” between Turkey and 1 ersia. but, on the other hand, the definite mandate given by the present Conference, first, to the Constantinople Board to construct the lazaret, and, secondly, to the Mixed Commission to provide the funds, seemed not a little likely to lead to the actual construction of the lazaret at no remote date. Your Lordship s final instructions authorized our acceptance of the proposals, hut subject to such conditions that the probability of the lazaret being brought into existence practically disappears. At the sixth plenary meeting of the Conference we stated that we accepted the proposals, but at the same time we dwelt on the considerations enumerated above as militating against the construction of the Ormuz lazaret, and added that we should prefer to see the time and moiiey spent in perfecting the Bussorah lazaret. At the final meeting, before signing the Convention, we made the following reserves, as conditions to which our acceptance of the proposed lazaret was subject:— 1 . That the decisions of the Mixed Commission concerning the advance of funds for its construction must be unanimous ; and 2. That no steps should be taken for its construction until the Con stantinople Board of Health shall have been reorganised in the manner agreed on by the present Conference. The positive refusal of Turkey, as already mentioned, to allow this reorganization removes all likelihood, at any rate for the present, that a Turkish sanitary post will be established at the entrance to the Persian Gulf. On the question of the reunion of the Mixed Commission, we repeated the condition under which His Majesty’s Government has already consented to its reunion, namely, that the Commission should put in a prominent position in its programme the possibility of reducing the sanitary dues in Turkish ports. 5. International Health Bureau. A proposal to establish a central office, under international manage ment, to collect and publish information on the course of epidemic diseases all the world over, was first made by the International Sanitary Conference held at Vienna in 1874, and the Austrian capital was then selected for its seat. That proposal was never carried out. It has been revived in a slightly modified form by Prance in the present Conference, and Paris has been proposed for its seat. The Bureau is intended to be organized on the model of the Weights and Measures Bureau, which also sits in Paris. M. Barrere, who introduced the proposal, was careful to state that the Bureau would he strictly international; that, wherever it might be located, the local Government should exercise no controlling in fluence over it; that its main object would be to collect and distribute information about epidemics and the measures taken to deal with them; and to indicate from time to time where the measures decreed by the International Conventions seemed to require amendment; and that it would in no way interfere with the sovereign rights of an infected country, or do more than exert a “moral” influence in regard to the sanitary measures taken in such country. MG48. Gflife in ns concerns the obtaining of information on course epidemics, the machinery already possessed by IIis Majesty s Govern ment for the purpose is as efficient, as, it not more efficient; than, any machinery that could he set up by an International Bureau; and it is very doubtful whether the Reports which the bureau would issue from time to time would he any more complete than those published by the Local Government Board. The passage of information through an International Bureau won Id ratner tend to ceiay than 1 o facilitate iG arrival to the Governments interested. So for as great Britain was concerned, therefore, the proposed bureau seemed to offer no advantage that she does not already posses. On the other hand, there are many countries which have not provided themselves with the same efficient mnehinerv, and to these countries the Bureau s Reports would piove of value. Provided that the International Bureau (should it he established) remains truly international in character, and confines its reports to a faithful reproduction of collected epidemiological facts, there would seem to he no objection to its establishment. Rut the possibility that the periodical reports might propagate views on sanitary theory and practice contrary to those always upheld by His Majesty’s Government was a consideration to which we could not he wholly blind. There is no doubt that the Trench delegation attached much impor tance to the proposed Bureau, and more to the selection of Paris for its seat; and we were desirous to meet their wishes to the fullest extent possible, and to avoid any action that might appear in the least unfriendly. But our doubts as to the utility of the proposed Bureau and the wisdom of selecting Paris as its seat were fully shared by the German and Austrian delegations. We felt that the matter had a diplomatic as well as a sanitary aspect, and that, in this early stage at least, the former class of considerations outweighed the latter. On these grounds we were of opinion that the proposal was one that could, be better dealt with at leisure, by subsequent correspondence through the ordinary diplomatic channels, than by the rapid decisions of a Sanitary Conference. It appeared undesirable to give open expression to these views at the meetings of the Conference ; but, as the result of private conversations with members of the Trench delegation, and to meet the wishes not only of ourselves hut also of our German and Austrian colleagues, the clause concerning this matter was modified in such a manner as to bring about the above result. The decisions of the ays and Means Commission as to the establishment and objects of this Bureau appear only as an Annex to the Convention, and the Article in the Convention itself merely states that the Conference having taken note (’‘ayant pris acte ”) ot these decisions, the Trench Government “ saisira, quand il le jugera opportun, de propositions a cet effet, par la voie diplomatique, les Etats representes a ia Conference.” At the final meeting for signature of the Convention we brieflv repeated the reserve we had already made in the Ways and Means Committee as to the unproved utility of the proposed Bureau. {¥&gt;')—Questions dealt with by the Technical Committee. One Ol the first questions dealt with was the incubation period of the plague. I hat period had been fixed by the Venice Conference of 1897 at ten days. It has now been reduced to five days (largely owing to the evidence adduced and the conclusions arrived at by the Indian Mague Commission). The principal results of this reduction have been the following:—A reduction from twelve to seven days in the plague- free period which determines whether a ship is “ infected ” or only&lt;c suspected ”; a reduction from ten to five days in the periods of o seiva .ion 01 surveillance which are imposed, according' to circum stances^ on the various classes of ships, whether in Europe, in the lied ea, oi m the Persian Gulf; and a similar reduction in the period after the last case of plague at the expiry of which a contaminated area is to ie icgaided as clean. (YVc have reported in detail in our earlier espatches the exact alterations made in the periods of observation and suiveillance imposed in the case of each particular class of ship, and have therefore confined ourselves here to the above general statement.) the decision that no goods are in themselves capable of transmitting P cX S lle 01 cholera, and that they become dangerous only when actuallv contaminated with the products of those diseases, has led to results w uch we regard with satisfaction. Disinfection can now be applied s *! c 1 £°cds as the local authority considers contaminated, and tne list of articles formerly called “ susceptibles,” which may be disin- ected or prohibited admission to a country, irrespective of whether Ihev aie contaminated or not, has been verv greatlv reduced. The decision that plague is not spread by water has led to the removal l orn the Convention of all those clauses which formerly required the c ange of drinking-water and the emptying of bilges in connection with plague on ship-hoard. Ihese measures are still retained in connection with ctiolera. The loimai recognition that a plague patient is no longer dangerous from the moment he is isolated has put “isolation ” on the same 0 level vith cure or “ death of a patient. This is tisome extent a gain, as implying the earlier removal of measures after the occurrence of a plague case on shore. On the other hand, the decision that the puttin- on of measures should date from the isolation, and not from the occurrence, of a case is a disadvantage in connection with pla-ue on ship-board. r ° The sections dealing with notification have been modified by the addition of clauses concerning rats (which we deal with later), and of a clause to the.effect that a single case of plague or cholera, even when indigenous, is not to involve the application of measures by other countries. The proposal to make the “ sanitary circumscription ” (for purposes of notification) a large one in the ease of cholera and a small one in the.case of plague was rejected ; and the only changes made in the definition of a circumscription are the substitution of the words “ une partie.de territoire bien determinee ” for the words “une partie de territoire^ d’un pays plaeee sous une autorite administrative bien determinee ” ; and the addition of “ un quartier dune ville ” and “ une agglomeration ” to the list of examples of circumscriptions. The classification of ships into “ infected,” “ suspected,” and “ clean remains unaltered, save that in the case of plague the plague-free period which determines whether a ship is infected or suspected has 1 been reduced from twelve to seven days. A formal proposal to base the classification of ships and the measures imposed on them, not on the state of health of the ship, but on that of the port of departure was brought forward by the French delegation. This proposal we regarded as. of a highly retrogiade character, and it would, if carried? have reintroduced a system against which our predecessors had strong! v and successfully fought in the earlier Conferences. It was opposed by ourselves and others, and no serious attempt was made to put it through. J - . The clause which allows the sanitary authority to take into con sideration, m the application of measures, the presence of a doctor and a stove on a ship, remains as in the former Convention; and analagons clauses have now been added respecting the presence of an apparatus for rat-destruction and of a State-appointed doctor. We did not object to these additions. In regard to the question* of State- appointed doctors, the preliminary discourses at the openin&lt;&gt;- meetino-s of the Conference had seemed to foreshadow proposals to make Itcompuhory o &gt; all sVips ‘o toTl^ SS 'hatlh 'presence of s^ch doctors 3 on board may be taken into coS adon in imposing measures on clean ships though we are aware Sat Witf'^e rarest exceptions, British ships wall not be m a eondUion t0 T'lie rdle’of 'tlie rat in the spread of plague was for the first time discussed by the present Conference, and, as was foreseen, this question occupied a very prominent position in its deliberations. A foinnal decision that “ the rat is a danger in the spread of plague was followed bv the introduction into the Convention of a senes of measures to meet this danger. These measures may be briefly SU hat^VlagueVn ll»ore is not to be notifiable in the absence of human plague. A proposal to make it so notifiable was made, but rejected. In the presence of human plague on shore, rat plague, if existent, is to be notified at the same time as the human disease, and, m the subse quent reports on the progress of the epidemic, and at its end, the measures taken to control rat plague are also to be reported. ^ In the classification of ships as “ infected, ‘-suspected, and clean, human plague is alone to he taken into consideration. A proposal was made to put rat plague on the same level as the human disease lor this purpose, but it was rejected. With regard to human plague on ships, rat destruction is made compulsory on 44 infected ” ships ; it is recom mended on “ suspected ” ships ; it is facultative, but no. to be applied, as a general rule, on “ clean ” ships from infected ports. With regard to rat plague on “ clean ” ships, rat destruction is com pulsory on^ships on hoard of which the presence of rat plague has been proved bacteriologieally. It is applied, “ if judged necessary, on ships on hoard of which an unusual rat mortality has been observed. The methods to he employed for rat destruction were discussed at oreat length. Tne claims of the various gases hitherto tried for this purpose, and even of special machines for their application (such as the Clayton apparatus. Professor Nocht’s carbon-monoxide prorlucer, and the machine used by the American authorities on the Mississippi) were strongly advocated by different Delegates. In the end, however, it was agreed—\vc think very rightly—not to recommend any individual method, mueii less any individual machine, for its application ; and the final decision on this*poiut was in the form of the following colourless assertion of facts :— s ‘In the present state of science, the methods that have been recommended as the most effective for rat-destruction on ships are the following:— “ 1. A mixture of sulphurous and sulphuric anhydrides, sent into the hold under pressure, so as to assure a thorough mixing of at least 8 per cent, of sulphurous acid per cubic metre of air. 44 2. A mixture of carbon-monoxide and carbonic acid. 4&lt; o. Carbonic acid.” It was further decided that, when not carried out bv the sanitary authority, the operation of rat-destruction should be controlled by t hem, so as to assure the complete destruction of all rats onboard; that it may be done either before or after the discharge of cargo; that the process is not to injure tine cargo, the engine&gt; or the walls of the ship ; that in the case of infected or suspected ships the operation must not last longer than •forty-eight hours, and in the case ot clean ships not longer t an twenty-four hoars; that in the ease of ships in ballast it must be done as rapidly as possible, and always before loading. In the case of a clean ship it is further laid down that the process is not to interfere with the circulation of passengers and crew between the ship and shore; and that if such a ship has once undergone the process, this is not to be repeated unless the ship has since come up to the quays inobserved^ POrt, ° r the presencc of sick or d ead rats on board lias been The clause which appeared in the former Conventions requirino* Governments to provide and equip one port at least on each of their sea S11P be dealfc with, whatever its sanitary state, is -nrvfA tl i Q i • 16 neW ^ ( J Llventlc | u - Pn this connection it is important to nil Pn! a S i- ps ’ e T en C v a ! 1 1 sb ^P s » from infected ports have, under the to iinrlp Veri i] 0118 ’ i^ eU iab ^ e 1 ,e P u l s ion to a properly equipped port, T,nw w s ffr d T, aiT measuros ot disinfection.

P i t! ’ ,m&lt; e, '. the eondition that, wlien carried into piactice, it should not, by reducing the number of sanitary stations, cause Joss to shipping. J With regard to the cost of rat-destruction on ship-hoard, it has been decided that, whether the measure be carried out by the sanitary authority or by a company or individual, the sum charged to the ship sbou d be hxed by a tariff published in advance, and should be at a rate which will not result in a profit to the State or sanitary authority. We have given at some length the above decisions concerning the danger from rats and the methods devised for meeting it. This matter has now come under interuational agreement for the first lime. Before the Conference met we were not a little apprehensive that the measures which would be imposed to deal with rats would be unnecessarily onerous to shipping and commerce. There was, as a matter of fact considerable divergence of opinion as to the exact degree of danger to he attributed to the rat, thousrh all were agreed that this animal is a danger. Our own view throughout has been that the danger has been proved, that the degree of importance to be attached to it has never been determined, and that it may easily he exaggerated, and that in some countries it has been greatly exaggerated. While prepared to accept reasonable measures to deal with rat-plague when its presence kas . ke . en . Proved, or even strongly suspected, we were opposed to indiscriminate rat-destruction, in cases where the presence of rat-plague was no more than a possibility. ° Proposals for measures of the latter kind were made to the Conference and it was our duty to combat them. We succeeded in obtaining a compromise, in which we think our views are, to a certain extent met We should have preferred to spe less latitude left to a sanitary authority m the ordeiing of rat-destruction on a clean ship from an infected port m the repulsion of such a ship to another port for this purpose, and in the matter of the charge made to ships for rat destruction. ’ But no better results were attainable, and the whole group of rat measures as finally established is of a much less stringent character than we had originally feared it would be. Nor do we think, in regard to the three points just mentioned, that the results in practice will be so prejudicial to shipping or commerce as might at first sight appear probable. Thus in the matter of the faculty left to sanitary authorities to destroy rats H048. uon clean ships from an infceteJ port, it is certain that in many instances the commercial rivalry between neighbouring ports will act as a restraint on port authorities in ordering indiscriminately a measure which might drive ships to other, more indulgent, ports. In the matter of the repulsion of ships to other ports for rat destruc tion, not only does the same (or an analogous) consideration hold good, hut ships will in the future, as in the past, ascertain what are the fully- equipped ports, and will sail to them first, instead of going to other ports, only to court repulsion. Finally, in the matter of the charge to shipping for rat destruction, we should have greatly preferred to see our own proposals accepted. These were that, when executed by the sanitary authority, the charge should not exceed the actual cost of the operation (not including the original cost of the plant), and that when done by a company or an individual, the charge should be as low as possible and should in no case exceed 300 fr. The rejection of these proposals—or rather the substitution for them of the clause quoted— leaves the door open to possible abuse, in the form of excessive charge for rat destruction when done by a company or individual. We should add that the opposition—or rather hesitation in accepting our proposals on tiiis point—shown by the German delegation was largely the cause of their rejection. Our German colleagues, however, showed subsequently their agreement generally with our proposals by making, when signing the Convention, a reserve, in the form of “ voeu,” that Governments will agree, in framing their tariffs for rat destruction, to prevent over-charge when the process is carried out by a company or individual. We repeated this “voeu” in making our own reserves. The Representatives of Brazil and the Argentine Republic were desirous of introducing into the Convention detailed regulations for the control of yellow fever. Colonel Gorgas, of the United States’ dele gation, read a very interesting report upon the work done in America in establishing the role of the mosquito in the spread of the disease; and the Argentine delegate submitted a draft set of regulations based upon the mosquito theory. Tin's was not, however, added to the Convention, which contains hut a single article (Article 182) concerning yellow fever. That article recommends the countries interested to bring their sanitary regulations into line with the teaching of modern science, particularly in regard to the part played by the mosquito in spreading the disease. (C .)—The Codification Committee. The work of this Committee was almost exclusively confined to reducing to one, more or less consistent, document the four preceding Conventions of 1892, 1893, 1894, and 1897. and incorporating in it the additions and modifications made by the present Conference. ' . In lMs &gt;sk, the preliminary work of M. Beco, the Belgian delegate m preparing editions of the earlier Conventions, first in parallel columns and then m a single, unified code, was of invaluable service. The above summary includes all the more important points dealt with hy the Pans Conference of 1903. lu this summarv we have not even attempted to mention every minute modification which lias been made in the samtary regulations previously in force under the old Conventions: Aii^itinr^ IMI 1 iat P W lcaUy ;i11 tll0se modifications result from the m^m^tTd t al,ot. 1,rmClplCS ^ the Co “ f —e, which we have W enn^w s C ? menti O“ substitutes a single consistent document for complex amt sometimes contradictory instruments. To sanitary the^ndividind ^ U ^ 0f C0 sma11 magnitude On national d w w d t tl0nS m0(llficatlons now introduced into inter national .„w, we have already expressed our opinion as each one wasdealt with. Of the new Convention as a whole we would venture to say that if, on the one hand, it seems to impose certain sanitary measures which were not (under international law) in force before, it offers, on the other hand, fresh advantages to shipping and commercial interests which were not offered by the former Conventions. We may briefly balance the gains and losses of the new Convention from the point of view of decrease or increase in restrictive measures, and the corre sponding approximation of the reverse to the liberal views which have always been held by Great Britain on the prophylaxis of disease. The. “ gains,” from this point of view, must he held to include the following:— 'Ihe reduction in the incubation period of plague, with consequent marked reduction in the regime applied, both on ship and on shore, both in Europe and. outside Europe, to deal with the disease.' The recognition that no class of goods is itself “susceptible” of carrying infection, and the consequent reduction in the list of goods which may be disinfected or prohibited admission to a country. The notification ot a first case of plague or cholera, even when indigenous, not to involve the application of measures. The end of an epidemic to date from the isolation, when isolation has been effected, instead of from the death or cure of the last patient. ihe decision that plague is not spread by water, and consequent removal of certain measures on ships intended to meet the supposed danger. The acceptance of the medical visit at night for ships passing the Suez Canal, and the permission, under certain conditions, to make that visit on board. Pilgrim ships belonging to nations that have accepted the Conventions to he allowed, under certain specified conditions, to transit the Canal without preliminary detention at Tor. The acceptance, in principle, of the transit of Egypt in train, en eontumace, by passengers and mails from the East. The “losses —or apparent losses—on the other hand, are principally those connected with the danger from rats. In practice, however, we are far from sure that the new Begulations to meet this danger are to he regarded as “ losses,” in the sense of adding new restrictions to shipping. The matter was not dealt with in any way by the old Conventions, and, consequently, many countries considered themselves free to impose almost any measure they thought fit to deal with rats. The result was a complete lack of uniformity, and entire uncertainty in the measures to which any ship was liable ; and in some countries (as, for example, Turkey and Erance) the measures actually imposed were excessively stringent. The new Convention has at least introduced the elements of uniformity and certainty. It has further established a maximum of rat measures, with a consequent power to claim compensation if a port authority exceeds that maximum. As we had the honour to point out in an earlier report, we think this maximum is placed too high, hut we may repeat that it is much lower than we had anticipated, much lower than was proposed to the Conference, and much lower than was actually in practice in some countries. In those countries British shipping is therefore a gainer, and not a loser, under the new Convention. Iif all countries shipping is a gainer, in that the new Convention lays down conditions which must be observed in applying rat destruction—con ditions which were often not respected in practice before. Thus, it is now established that the process must not cause damao-e to the cargo, the engines or the vessel itself; that it must not last more than twenty-four hours in some cases, forty-eight hours in others, and that, in the case of a clean ship, it is not to be done as a general rule; it is not to interfere with the circulation of passengers or crew from ship to shore and is not to he unnecessarily repeated.The Convention was signed on the 3rd December by the Depre- ■ L e . , °t» ^mirvWTno* IS!

O the reserves which wall he mentioned later. The Representatives of Portugal, Greece, Persia, Egypt, Brazil, the United States and Servia signed ad referendum. The Representatives of Sweden and Norway and of Denmark did not sign the Convenlion. The Turkish delegation stated that they were authorised to sign, but under so many reserves that these would have practically annulled the whole Convention. Under these circumstances the President of the Conference stated that he could not permit them to sign the Convention. His remarks on this point are condensed into a single sentence in the printed but, as a matter of fact, he spoke at some length on the impropriety of, and the impossibility of permitting, the signature of any Delegates under such conditions. This is, we believe, the first occasion on which, in a Sanitary Convention, the list of reigning Sovereigns, or heads of States, whose Plenipotentiaries have accepted the Convention, has included the name of His Highness the Khedive of Egypt, and that the Convention has been signed by the Egyptian delegates. The position thus brought about is somevdmt anomalous. The Egyptian Delegates had, throughout the Conference, been regarded as technically part of the Turkish delegation. They bore the same relation to that delegation as the Indian Delegate did to the British delegation. They had the right of voting in Committee, but not in the plenary meetings. Yet the refusal of the President to allow r the Turkish Delegates to sign the Convention has brought about the remarkable result that that document bears the signature of the Egyptian Delegates, but not those of the Turkish, while the name of the Khedive, but not that of the Sultan, appears in the list of the Signatory Powurs. Me should add that it w r as unanimously agreed (with the exception of the Tuikish delegation) that lire Powers represented at the Conference should use their best endeavours to induce Turkey to accept and apply the International Sanitary Conventions. The following is a brief summary of the reserves under which certain 1 owers, as stated above, accepted the Convention :— -ixeserves or ejrear .Britain.

(#.) That, the decisions of that Commission, when voting funds for this purpose, must he unanimous. (c.) That no steps shall be taken for the construction of the station in question until the Constantinople Board of Health shall have been reorganized in the manner agreed upon by the present Conference. The British delegation further supported the “ voeu ” of the German delegation respecting the cost of rat-destruction on ships. Beserves of Germany. 1 . A “ voeu ” that when rat destruction is carried out by a Company or an individual, the charge made to the ship shall not be excessive. 2. A reserve, of minor importance, respecting the disinfection of certain objects. 3. As to the unproved utility of the proposed International Health Bureau. Beserve of Austria. As to the unproved utility of the proposed International Health Bureau. Beserve of the United States. As to the substitution of ei surveillancefor ie observation,** on account of special legislation in the different States of the Union. ’ Beserve of Holland. Holland reserves the right to name as Delegate to the Constantinople Boa/id of Health either a medical man with a Dutch qualification or a Consular official of the rank of Vice-Consul at least, whatever may he the country he represents or the nationality to which he belongs. It is in the words in italics that this reserve differs from Article CLXIX. of the Convention, which is ambiguously worded in more than one respect. Beserve of Egypt. Egypt is unable to accept Article CLXIII. of the Convention respecting the annual contribution by the Egyptian Government of 4,000towards the increased cost of the staff under the Alexandria Quarantine Board. . i A gloom was cast over the last week of the Conference by the sudden ilmess and death of Professor Proust, of the Erench delco'ation. The name of Professor Proust had been for so long associated with inter national sanitary work, and he had always taken such an active prominent, and valuable part in the preceding, as in the present Conferences, that his death was felt as a loss, not merely to Prance but to the whole world of sanitary workers. All the delegations attended his funeral, which was a public one, and the message Sf con dolence and sympathy which we had the honour to communicate to the Conference by your Lordship’s instructions created a very favourable impression and was warmly appreciated by the President and other members of the Erench delegation. We desire, in conclusion, to pay a sincere and deserved tribute to the Erench Government for the hospitable manner in which we, as all the foreign delegations, were received and entertained, collectively and individually. We were most courteously received by M Loubei 14048. p JDelegates. President of the Republic, at the Elysee, and we were more than once the Quests of M. Delcassd, who honoured us with invitations to some of the entertainments given at the time of the visit ot the King and Queen of Italy to Paris.
