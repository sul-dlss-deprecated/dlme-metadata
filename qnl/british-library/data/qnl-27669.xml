Sultan showed very little interest in the news about oil In Qwador. I did not discuss it with him as I a© not supposed to know about it, but Woode-^allard informs me that he does not wish anything at all to be done or said about it* Yours sincerely, r- o/c- His Sroellencgr Sir Rupert Ray, KCI2., CSI.

WITH THE COMPLIMENTS OF HIS MAJESTY’S POLITICAL RESIDENCY BRITISH RESIDENCY, 3rd April, BAHREIN, PERSIAN GULF. 1950.a* ‘*r Chauiicy iniorms me that the authorities at Gwahur, especially Wynne, are much excited because a show oi‘ oil has been found there. I rather doubt ii anything will come of it as the greater part of the iwekran, though not I think Gwadur itseli, was examined by oil company geologists before or during the war and they considered the prospects oi finding oil were very poor. The Burma Oil Company were interested in Gwadur before tne war, but broke off negotiations with the ? 0 f5 es g°^ ence ending with Peel's letter P. Z. 50!?3/39 ol the 25th August, 1939 , to Abraham, a copy of which I enclose for reaay reference. Indian Gil Concessions Limited were also interested and obtained a concession from the khan of kalat for trie rest oi Mekran. as far as I know, that company has now ceased to exist. 14 , n ^ inl ' orm A n b you of the situation, as it seems likeiy that when the Sultan hears of the show oi oil he will try ana persuade some company to abDlv ior ^ concession for Gwadur. This will embarrass us as quite apart from the fact that it is likely to encourage the Pakistan Government to renew their efiorts to obtain possession of the place, the boundary wutn iuexran state is disputed and has never been properly ceiinea, though wnen I was Agent to the Governor-General^ in Bduchistan the Government of India accepted a boundary which I proposed as a basis for deciding questions oi jurisdiction.

Dear Abraham, Many thanks for your letter of the 18th August on the subject of the Gwadur Concession. We note that your Company have decided to withdraw their application for concessionary rights in Gwadur, and that it is proposed to offer the bultan an ex gratia payment of hs.75)000. We do not think that this generous treatment of the Sultan on the part of your Company could in any way embarrass the Government of India. In accordance with your request a copy of your letter is being sent to the Government of India and to the Political Resident. Yours sincerely, (bga. ) R. Peel. Lt.-Col. W.E.V.
