In his left hand he carries a percussion instrument and in the crook of the same arm what appears to be a woven mat. On his head he wears a fur-edged, peaked hat, made of likely woven cloth.The bearded man on the left wears a ragged patchwork coat, a bag at his right side (the strap crosses across his chest), a dark-coloured bead necklace, a fur-lined hat and a gourd at his left side. In his right hand he holds a long straight wooden instrument, perhaps percussive, and in his left a further percussion instrument.The negative has had hand-work applied, causing the it to take on a soft-shaded paint-like quality in places. In particular the original background has been substituted completely. In addition, the men’s feet have been cut out of the frame.Inscriptions:Printed above image, in ink:XXIIPrinted beneath image, in ink:‘Derwische aus Buchara.’A circular 'British Museum' blind stamp is located in the lower left corner.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Portrait photography</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023619120.0x000039#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
