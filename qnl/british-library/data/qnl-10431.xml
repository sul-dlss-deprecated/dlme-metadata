It was taken from a position southeast or southwest of the mausoleum.The surrounding text makes reference to the martyrdom of Hamza and other ‘companions of the prophet’, as well as the incident in which Mohammed lost two teeth in the battle. Born ‘Abd al-Muttalib, Hamza was the paternal uncle of Mohammed and is venerated for his heroism and ultimate martyrdom at this site during the Battle of Uhud (625 CE) against the Meccans.The structure in this image may have been, at least in location and outline, the same as that rebuilt in the twelfth century – which in turn followed a traditional site of veneration dating to the second century A.H. – however, the aspects of the building visible here are clearly more modern, particularly the hewn-stone outer wall. Richard Burton, in his
                           Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to El Medinah and Meccah(1857, Vol. I, pp. 407–08), describes and illustrates a ground plan of a mausoleum-cum-mosque at this site, which is identical in description to that illustrated here.Pilgrims can be seen entering into the mausoleum, while a lone Ottoman soldier stands in the centre of the image at the corner of the building. Some figures are blurred from movement during the exposure. To the right of the entrance and adjacent to the neighbouring low-lying building in the right middleground a stand bearing rows of earthenware or wooden vessels is situated: these may have had a ceremonial function for pilgrims and bear a resemblance to the
