Correspondence over the matter was prompted by what the British and United States Governments perceived as economic and political disarray in Iran, and the potential threat this had to Allied operations in the South-East Asian theatre of war during the Second World War. The correspondence covers: the British Government’s request for financial advisers and relief workers from the USA; the US State Department’s attitude towards the request; discussion between the British and US Governments over potential candidates for advisory roles in Persia; the ongoing status of US advisers in Persia during and after the end of the War. The file’s principal correspondents are: HM Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the British Legation in Tehran, Reader William Bullard; the Foreign Office; and HM Ambassador to the United States of America, Edward Frederick Lindley Wood, who is referred to in correspondence as Viscount Halifax.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to the United States of America</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Department of State</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Financial administration</topic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000056#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000056#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
