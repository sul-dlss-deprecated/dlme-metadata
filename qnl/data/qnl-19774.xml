This letter continues to report on affairs in Bushire. Hennell states that since the arrival at Bushire of Moollah Ahmed, the Moollah Bashee, confidence has been restored to the mercantile community. Hennell reports that the Moollah Bashee has called upon Bakir Khan to give back the fort of Chakoota; Bakir Khan has refused to do so, on the grounds that on taking the fort, he was only acting under the orders of the Nazim ul Mulk. Other details include speculation that the Chief of Dashtee [Khormoj, Iran] is contemplating attacking Bakir Khan.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051546.0x000003#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
