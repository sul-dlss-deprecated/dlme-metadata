Fart I Everything on the eerth, and so far as we know inside the earth. Is composed of one or more of some 80 fundamental substances, known as elements, so called because atoms of these elements cannot easily be split up into si pier substances. When I was at school we were abie to omit the word 'easily”. There are only about a dozen common elements and of these the best known are possibly Iron, dulphur, dhlorine, Oxygen, Carbon, Hydrogen. Elements combine with one another to form compounds which in general - and this is a very interesting point - bear little or no resemblance to the elements from which they were forreed. For example hydrogen (a gas which we put into balloons) combines with oxygen (which all of us are now breathing into our lungs) to form water, which of course would be a poor filling for balloons or lungs, and sodium (a metal which if thrown on to water would cause a small explosion) combines with chlorine (a poisonous gas) to form sodium chloride, or common salt, which is neither explosive nor poisonous, and so on. When elements comb ne with one another they normally do so in very simple proportions, by atoms. For example, one atom of % sodium combines with one atom of chlorine to form one compound atom, or molecule as It Is called, of common salt, and two atoms of hydro— ,^Qn combine with one atom of oxygen to form one compound atom or molecule of water. But we do not get for example 17 atoms of hydrogen combining with 29 atoms of oxygen, or any complicated ratio of that kind. The proportions are very simple, usually 1 ; 1 , or 1 ; 2 , or 1 : 3 , or 2 j 3 , There is however one element. Carbon, which has the unique property of combining with hydrogen (and with certain other elements)- in a very lar^e number of different proportions, some of which are highly complicated. For example, one atom of carbon combines withwith 4 atoms of hydrogen to form one molecule of a gas called methane, and 2 atoms of carbon combinea with 6 atoms of hydrogen to form a somewhat similar gas called ethane. Again 8 atoms of carbon combine with 18 atoms of hydrogen to form a light mobile liquid, 12 of carbon with 26 of hydrogen to form a heavier and distinctly more viscous liquid, 20 of carbon with 42 of hydrogen to form a still more'viscous liquid, and so on until we reach a relatively enormous molecule (1 say 'relatively 1 because ol course all are ultra—microscopic) formed by the union of say JO atoms of carbon with 62 r atoms of hydrogen, which at normal temperatures would oe solid. ’hose of you who are mathematically inclined will have noticed that all of these different compounds answer to the formula N atoms of Carbon combined with 2N + 2 atoms of Hydrogen, and all of them, together with the intervening ones which I have not mentioned, form what we may call a series of compounds all made from the same fundamental bricks, carbon and hydrogen, and conform ing to a fixed law as re ards the numbers of the different bricks employed. I want to strees two points about such a series of compounds;— (a) Hone of the compounds in the series resemble ' either the carbon or the hydrogen from which they are formed — in this they run true to form, on the analogy of water and common salt which I gave earlier, but (to) Any one of. these compounds resembles very closely indeed the compound next to it, on either side, in the series, and there is indeed a steady gredation of properties from one enu to the other of the series. One result of the similarity between all of the comnounds in such a series is that they are miscible with one another in almost any proportions, and Crude Oil is simply o mixture of a large number of such compounds, ranging from very small moleculesmmmmm •3- &lt; 5 ) moleoul^a, which at ordinary temperatures are geseoue, through light mobile li lulus followed by heavier more viscous liquids until, with increasing size of molecule, we reach substances which if isolated would normally be solids rather than liquids. I want you to keep this picture of crude oil as a mixture of more or less similar compounds - hydro-carbons as they are called - in your minds because I shsll return to it when we come to consider refining. Note incidentelly at least one essential difference between a compound and a mere mixture; a compound does not, whereas a mixture does, resemble its constituents. 2. How Oil is formed . Oil is believed to have been formed by the decomposition of animal matter, probably very large numbers.of exceedingly small — even microscopic — animals, which were entrapped in sedi men ^® laid down on the bottom of shallow seas. ;&gt;uch sediments consist commonly of alternations of clays and sandstones, and it is pro bable that the oil was formed in the clays and then forced into the more porous sandstone. If we fill a tumbler with sand, tamp ing it down so that it will hold no more, we may regard the tumbler as being full of sand, but in fact it is possible still to pour into the tumbler a volume of water equal to between a quarter ana a third of the volume of the sand. This water occupies the nore space between sand grains and it is in similar minute pore spaces that so called oil pools normally occur. There is no such thing as an underground lake of oil. Sometimes, and notably in Persia, the reservoir rock is a limestone instead of a sandstone, and in such cases the oil occupies cracks and fissures which tend to be much bi^er than the very minute pore spaces in a sandstone. How Oil is found . • sediments at the bottom of a sea are noramlly laid down more or less horizontally, but subsequent earth movements - and we should remember that no part of the earth is ever stationary -stationery — may cause the strata to be folded Into ups and downs, yghen oil is forced into the pore spaces of sandstones it usually forms only a small part of the total liquid in these pore spaces the remainder beln b water, .e might have for example in a hori- zontal sheet of sandstone 99 per cent water and only 1 per cent oil, and such on accumulation could be of no economic or commer cial value, when however sich strata are folded the oil, being lighter than the water, makes Its way very slowly up to the tops of the folds so that all, or nearly all, of the one per cent of oil which was formerly dissipated over a big horizontal sheet of sandstone is now concentrated in a small area at the top of the fold, and surrounded on all sides by the 99 P er cent of water. This oives the clue to how oil is found. Oeologists working in areas known (because perhaps of oil surface seepages) to contain oil bearing rocks search for evidence of folds, or anticlines as they are called, where oil mi b ht have accumulated. When an anticline is found atest well is drilled to prove or disprove the presence of oil in economic quantities. This is what we mfght call the classical theory of finulng oil but it is of course very much over simplified, and in particu lar I should point oat that over large parts of the earth’s surface evidence from which Geologists can make deductions as to whether and how rocks are folded underneath the surface does not exist. In such areas other methods, some depending on variations in the force \ . of gravity and some on the speed of travel of earthquake waves through the earth, are used. Such methods, known generally as Geophysical methods, involve the \ise of most delicate and complicated instruments, and are usually very expensive. 4, How Oil it- proauced. When an exploratory boring (test well) has struck oil in promising quantity the extent of the productive area has to be established by further drilling before development i.e. carefully planned production over a period of years can be begun. The-5- Tha further development of an oilfield then involves: (a) The urilling of a sufficient number of wells to the oil reservoir, whether this be 500 feet or 5 » 0 G 0 or 10,000 feet deep. yuch .oils when drilled are lined with steel casing which may vary from about 4” to about 14* in diameter. (b) The production of oil through this steel casing. In some cases the oil may flow under its own pressure (or perhaps more correctly under the pressure of the gas which is dissolved in the oil, or of the * surrounding salt water, the proper conservation of gas pressure is therefore very important) and in other cases it has to be pumped through smaller diameter tubing inserted for the purpose. ,,hen a new well is brought on to production, whether by flowing or by pumping, its rate of production normally falls off rapidly - perhaps by 50 per cent in six months but there are the widest possible variations in this respect. Later its decline rate, as it is called, becomes less and in old age a well often produces for years at a very small, but only very gradually diminishing rate. im oilfield, oonsisting of perhaps hundreds of wells in different stages of their lives, will have a composite decline rate — perhaps 25 per cent per annum — and if production has to be maintained at any given level - say to maintain a particular re finery throughput — sufficient new wells will normally have to be drilled to offset this decline. If total production has to be raised, instead of merely Kept level, the drilling programme will have to be still more infeteese. h. How Oil is refined . I described crude oil arlier as a mixture of a large num ber of different hydro-carbon compounds, ranging from very small■- 6 - 8 /nall moleculee which ere gaseous'at ordinary temperatures through light mobile and then increasingly heavy and more viscous liquids up to solids. If we could separate these constituents into groups the smallest molecules would be in the form of a gas, the next bigger group would form petrol, the next bigger kerosene, Jihen gas oils of various kinds, and then lubricating and other oils. The residue which would then remain would be a heavy fuel oil or even solid bitumen. The first oroblem in refining is how to i?plit up the crude oil into these main groups, and the answer is a very simple one; apply heat. If all of these different molecules are heated the small light ones will be vapourised first, and it is easy then to collect this vapour and condense it again to a liquid. Thus by applying a certain amount of heat we can boil off all the petrol molecules and re-condense these to form liquid petrol. If we apply greater heat to what remains we can similarly boll off the kerosene, and so on until eventually only fuel oil/bitumen remain. This, like much of what 1 have said and will say to-day, is an over-simplification of what happens, but it is essentially correct. In practice aany more separate ’fractions 1 (as they are called) are boiled off in this way than I have suggested and by an ingenious system all of the fractions are boiled off simultaneously and not one after the other, end collected in separate containers. Some of the fractions are almost ready for use as they are boiled off, but in most cases some further treatment is necessary. In the case of petrol certain substances have usually to be added to improve its anti-knock properties, and aviation Spirit in particular is a tailor-made product which can never be put in an aeroplane just as it boils off from a crude oil. Kerosene and \ gas oils and diesel oils of various kinds do not as a rule require very much treatment subsequent to distillation but lubricating oils may require a great deal. In the picture that I hove here given to you it would not be possible, except within fairly narrow limits, to vary the pro portions of the main products derived from any given crude oil. V.e' -7- .,e would have to btoil off a certain percentage of petrol and a certain percentage of kerosene. If there were no way of getting round tnls difficulty it would be irapossib e (again except within fairly narrow limits) to adapt the volumes of different products to varying marxet demands, and in particular to the imperative demanas oi w#i*» Luckily .ve ar not. so tied. It has boon iound that the b.g molecules of say the gas oil and fuel oil ranges will, if heated sufficiently strongly and at sufficiently high pressures, split up into smaller molecules. Thus we can 'crack” fuel oils and as a result obtain petrol - not as big a volume of petijl as that of the fuel oil cracked but still an appreciable amount. This cracking process has added greatly to the flexibility oi tnc petrol eum industry in respect of volumes of different products required-. • 6 . How Oil is trans?i)orted . The main products of petroleum when separated are transported in bulk by tanker, rail or road tank-car and pipe line. Throughout the recent war, incidentally ,transportation was always - though some tines only just - the bottle-neck in respect of supply to the different theatres. From road or rail tank-car or pipe line petrol goes into pumps, fuel oil Into tanks or bunkers, other products into packages of different kinds. S' part II petroleum products in ftar . Towards the end of the recent war petroleum products consti tuted about one half of the total tonnage which haa to be moved to any theatre. The tonnage required was about 100 times as great as in the 19 14-IS war and the resultant world requirements (excluding n axis-controlled countries and oil produced In Russia) was at its peak in 1945 about one million tons per day, made up very roughly j. as follows:-mmmm wmmmmmmmmmmKKKKKmmmmmmmmmmmmmrntmammmmm follows i wmwmmmammmmmtmmMmmmmrnmmmmmm - 8 - Tons 100,000 300.0 ,0 100.000 4 00.000 ' 100,000 Aviation spirit Motor Spirit Kerosene i^uel Oils Other products (inciua'ing 'loss’’) To make these enormous quantities available four main achievements were necessary: (a) Crude Oil production had to be increased by about a third, from its pre-war figure of something like three quarters of a million tons per day. This, as you will appreciate from what I have already said, meant greatly intensified drilling programmes. The main increase was in America although the per centage increase was actually greeter in the Persian Gulf, (b) refinery capacity had to be similarly increased. This was done not so much by building new refineries (though this also was necessary) as by making fuller use of existing refineries, treating all allied refinery capacity ou side of Russia as a single whole and putting each individual refinery to the best possible use for the common good, (c) Special arrangements had to be made for particular products, and above all for Aviation Spirit, the output of which had to be incr ased no less than ten times, and the quality of which was increased from 87 octane to 100 octane. This increase in the so called octape nimber is the technical way of indicating an improvement of anti-knock quality, and it may mean more to you if I say that a change 1 from 87 to 100 octane makes possible higher compression and means a reduction of l 6 per cent in take-off distance and an increase of 4o per cent in climbing speed. This combination of improved-9- improved quality with a tenfold Increase In quantity was an outstanding achievement, cell- in^ for many completely new plants. Most of the increase was again in America but we have every right to be proud of the British contri- bution too, especially perhaps at Abadan. (d) Lastly certain large-scale transportation adjust ments wero necessary. of these the most import ant were perhaps:- (i) the switch over for U.K. supplies which, to save tanker tonnage, became necessary from the Persian Gulf to Venezuela as soon as Italy denied the passage of the keaiterranaan to our shi &gt;ping. v?e could not afford the long haul from the Persian Gulf round the Cape to U.K. and for a time, as a consequence, Abadan had to be shut down below what it could oroduce - only to regain its importance not long afterwards when Japan denied us the oil of the Dutch East Indies and of Burma, (ii) the action of American oil interest, be fore America entered the war, in carrying oil rom Venezuela, Trinidad etc. to Mew York, where oar tankers could pick it up for the much shorter journey to U.K., (iii) the arrangements made, first by rail tank- car and barge, ana later by the laying of enormous trans-continental pipelines, to * relieve American tankers from the work of carrying petroleum products fr^fc the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic seaboard, and thus free them for the common effort of supplying U.K. and the theatres of war as they developed.developed. These arrangements were made possible only by the utmost goodwill on the part of American oil interests before America entered the war, and thereafter by a complete fusion of the oil interests - of all kinds - of r J.K. and U. Sven then no transportation ad justments would have won the day had it not been for an intensive tanker building programme, mainly In 0.3.A,, which loft the Allies at the end of the war in spite of vory heavy losses with appreciably more tanker tonnage - and faster tonnage - than at the beginning of the war. Another important factor was the very big storage space of just short of 11 million tons which had been created in U.K. before the war. This reservoir, with excellent fast working taps both in and out, and backed up later by over 1,000 miles of pipe line in U.K. alone, gave a flexibility to our supply arrangements without which some of our transportation crises Could not have been surmount ed. as an example the North African landing was fuelled largely on stocks ex U.K. Part III ftorld production and Consumption Sources of petroleum in war are essentially those which have been discovered and developed in peace, and 1 I think it may help us to understand better what I have just said about war problems, and also to see more clearly the probable oil picture of the future, if we examine shortly the present world position as regards production and consumption. Ww can express this very Simply, if a little roughly, as follows, taking production figures as they were in the war * production % Consumption % 0.3.A. 65 60 Caribbean etc. 15 , 5 Russia 10 10 Persian Culf etc. 6 — Rest of world 4 25 By far the most important f?ct which at once strikes us is that although America is very easily the biggest producer she consumes• consumes nearly as much as she proauces — before the war almost exactly as much — and thus has only a relatively small exportable surplus. nussla 9 ^ain consumes what she produces, and for all practical purposes, looking at It in a broad way, the Caribbean (especially Venezuela) and the Middle Cast (especially the Persian GKilf) are left to supply the rest of the world. The uutch ^ast Indies and hurma, though important geographically are relatively unimportant as regards percentage volume, and the s*me applies to Germany} s main war tl ie source of natural petroleum; Rumania. Indeed when we look at these figures we are amazed that Germany was able to keep herself as well supplied as she did with petroleum products —largely by manufacture of substitutes — and we can understand some thing of what she was prepares to risk in an attempt to get for herself, and deny to riussla, the rich oilfields of the Caucasus. With this somewhat over-simplified but essentially correct world picture in our minds we can see that the main oil nroblem for the allies in the last war was how to make best use of what ve may perhaps call the 'free oil surplus'', after U. 3 .A. and Russia ha., taken their own requirements. Incidentally do not make the mistake of thinking that the enormous American oil consumption could have been ^reatly reduced in war. Ihla huge oonaumption is for better or worse part of the American economy and if supplies are denied that economy will break down - the wheat will not be out and the steel will not be produced and the country will not function - even the railways of America are to km an appreciable extent oil fuelled. The 'free oil surplus”, after U.S.a. and dussl* are satisfied, le, therefore, in w»r as in peace: (i) the big surplus of the Carribean, especially Venezuela (ii) the smaller, but rapidly growing, surplus of the v . ' Persian Gulf. i iii) W hat U. 3 &gt;. can spare - this was practically nil before the war ana will soon be nil or a minus quantity now that the war is over, but during the war, because of the great efforts to which I have referred and because of very considerable civil rationing, it was an appreciable and vital contribution, all the more so because such a large part of it was the all important aviationspirit 30 muon for present day supply and demand, but what of the future? World consumption of petroleum products has risen during the present century as follows:- 19 b’C) •••••••«• 50,000 tons per day 1910 . 100,000 do. 1920 230,000 do. 193 ^••••••••' 500,000 do, 1940 900,000 do. 1945 1,000,000 do. and although with the end of the war consumption has now fallen back somewhat it has not fallen back to anything like the 1938“ or 1939 figure ana all indications are that it will continue to increase - possibly not at the phenomenal rate of the first half of the century but still at a very rapid rate, consumption twenty years from now being estimated as between Ij and two million tons per day. In this connection it should be remembered that consumption of petroleum proaucts per head of population over the whole of Asia excluding .iussia is not much more than one per cent of average consumption per head in or, putting much the same thing another way, if everyone in the world consumed as much petroleum as the average American citizen world cons mption - if obtainable - would be something like eight million tons per day - eight times as much as the peak allied load (excluding rtussia) during the war, I don’t say that it is likely that the whole world will become Americanized from this point of view but the figures will give you some idea of the leeway of consumption some part of which will certainly be raaae up. In addition to which American consumption is itself certain to increase, v part IV , „orld Heserves of Petroleum . Onvhat reserves of petroleum can the world draw for its present enormous and future even greater dally demands? 1 shall deal first and mainly with what are called proved’ reserves - not ibb thematically but still reasonably certain. These amount to-13- © to sonie 8,000 million tons, enough to maintain present consump tion for about twenty years. i*bOiit 35 per cent of this reserve is in U.3*A* A further * •/ 35 peJ' cent is in the Persian uulf end thereabouts. a further 15 pep cent is in the Caribbean, mainly in Venezuela. That raasea g- per cent of the worlds proved reserves, all or nearly all essentially under American or British commercial control. Of the balance Russia holds 10 per cent, leaving 5 P® r cent for the rest of tne world. On the basis of proved reserves therefore the Persian Gulf ties for first place with U.'.A., leaving the Caribbean and Russia as baa third end fourth and the rest of the world nowhere. The British brnpire holds one per cent of the worlds proved reserves. But the importance of the Persian ^ulf, from an economic and even more from a strategic poiht of view, is very much greater than suggested by the figure of 35 psr cent which I have just given to you. For the reserves of U.B.j*. and Russian are not ‘’free’. They are already earmarked, and more than earmarked, for those two graat countries. In the recent war, oy great efforts, U.d.A. was able to export about 10 per cent of her oil products but there is not the slightest chance of. her being able to do this in a t future war, say in twenty years* time.. It is as certain as any thing can be in this uncertain world that in a few years' time, and thereafter increasingly, U.i.A. will become a net importer of oil. Instead of a net exporter, and therefore a debit rather than a credit factor from the point of view of contributing petroleum produc ts for the post of the world, or for overseas theatres of war. Taking even the best case however; namely that by a great effort America can just look after herself, and can manege with purely American rsserves, we see that the 'free surplus” reserves of the world, excluding both U.S.A. and Russia, are almost entirely in the Persian Gulf region and the Caribbean, in the proportion of TO per cent in the former and 30 per cent in the latter* This ip the real index of the importance of the Persian Gulf, This prolific region, discovered in the first instance entirely by British enterprise, and }°ter extended by both Britishthe predominance of the Persian gulf in relation to the rest of the world, and especially in relation to the 'free surplus reserve' of the .v or Id, will with furtiu-r exploration be as great as or greater than ever. Mote incid ntally that less than half of the Persian uulf reserves are in Persia, the remainder being in Iraq and - still more Important - 4n the west side of the Persian (Julf from Kwfiit southwards* Conclusion ,&gt; In conclusion I should like to emphasize two thin SSi - LlS . s ^» 1^ this very short talk I have over simplified everything* I believe I have done so without giving any ialse ideas but if any of you want . ,, tion more detailed informs- on any point I can probably supply it. secondly, please remember that there is nothing static aoout oil or the oil industry, as regards either search for new d posits or research into new products. The less imoortant products of to-day may be the more important ones of tomor row. jt is not so very long since petrol was regarded as a waste product of kerosene manu facture, and kerosene, after a period of rela tively minor importance, may now become impor tant as a fuel for jet aeroplanes. In many cases fuel development and engine development march hand in hand and it is hard to say which leads the other. J have not ha., time even to € refer to a host of so called 'chemicals', i ^eluding acetone, synthetic rubber and even ordinary alcohol, which can now be maue from petroleum and just as X have ventured no guess as to when and how the atom will become an Important source of energy so I shall make no attempt to forecast what products, and in what proportions, and whether for Deace or war - but let*s hope for peace - we shall then be-OIL part 1 1. uhot Is Jriae Oil?

PivnT' IV ..orlu nes^rveo of petroleum. On what reserves of petroleum con the world draw for its present enorraoud and future even greeter dally demands? 1 shall deal first and mainly with what are called ’'proven** reserves - not mathematically but still reasonably certain. These amount to some 10,000 million tons, enough to maintain present consump tion for about twenty-five years. 'he allocation of this as between our five main divisions is roughly as followss i-12- f ollo^a: - Proved Heservee (1Q.QQ0 mllilon tong) , u. ^5 ; ^ Jeribbean eto. 10 ^ 10 /r Persian Gulf/Iraq eto 50 7 Xest of world 5 / 100 % We see at once from this that U«3«A« does not possess reserves oorarrensurate with the rate at which she is now oroduo— ing. This is the fundamental reason why American dependence on outside supplies must, ae we have noted, continuously increase* Production from the Persian Gulf area, on the other hand, is far less than proved reserves here would Justl’fy, and great increases will be possible. Russia appears, nt her ore sent production rate, to have just her correct allocation of reserves. The Persian Gulf/Iraq area is an easy first but its impor tance from an economic end strategic point of view is even greater than su geateu by the 30 per cent figure. For neither the American nor the stuasian reserves are 'free’*, in the v sense ol being avail- oble for deficit .reaa. Th.y elready .orTasrHed, and nor. than ear merged, for those two grout countries. The •'free' surplus reserves of the world «re therefore, for sll practical purooses, those of the Persian Gulf/Iraq area and those of the Caribbean, and of these two the former is by far the more Important, llfio region, discovered In the first instance entirely by British enterprise, and later extended by both British and imerloan oil aomoenbs, is the free surplus reserve of the world, and who ever holds it effectively holds an asset of almost InoBlauhble value, in peace or war, so long as oil Is essential for both. It seems almost like giluin,;, the Illy to aau that beoauoe the reservoirs In the Persian Gulf area are largely limestones, with big creeks and flssurei Instead of very small sandstone pore spaces, indi vldual w# 11 . In this area prouuce on average very much more oil per day than over the world as s whole. a slight turning of s tap on a weil. In Persia- 13 - m ■ HmmmmmmmmmKmmmmm—m—mmm aa»y awan as much extra oil production as the drilling of a hundred or more wells in an American oilfield. The average yield per well all over America ie no?/ about Ij tons per day; ^4 n Persia it is more then 2 0 O )0 tons nor day. You moy care to note that the oomraeroial ownershin of the proved reservea of the Persian dulf/Ireq rea io about seven-tweli tbs brltish, four-twelfths i.raoricon and one-twelfth French. ftote also that (very roughly) about one-third of these proveu reserves are in Persia, about one-third in Iraq ana about one-third on the Kuweit/Wabian coast. In addition to the world proved reserves of about 10,00J million tons there are foir or five times that quantity of what we may call “speculative' reserves. actual figures are too uncertain to be worth quoting but indications are that the total (proved plus speculative) reserves of the world are divided in much the same way as are the proved reserves. T he main differ ence is llxely to be that American percentage, and possibly some others, will drop end that the Russian percentage will go up from 10 per cent to 20 per cent, or even higher. In other words, when Russian exploration is completed, or much more fully develop ed she may not have the same feeling of inferiority which she possibly now has vis a vis the enormous oil reserves of the Persian Ctulf region. Joncldsion . In conclusion I should li e to emphasize two things:— £i£st, in this very short talk I have over simplified everything. I believe I have done so without giving any false ideas but if any of you want more detailed information on any point I can probably supply it. jecondly . pleas© remember that there is nothing static about oil or the oil industry, as regards. -14- el ther search for new deposits or research into new proauuts. The less Important prodiots of to-usy taay be the more Important ones of tomor row. It Is not so very Ion# since petrol was regarded »s a waste product of kerosene manu— fact ire, and kerosene, .alter a period of rela tively minor importance, may now become impor tant as » fuel for jet aeroplanes. in many cases fuel development and engine march hand in hand and it is hard to say which leeas the other. I bove not hcd time even to refer to n host of so ealleu 'cheislosls' 1 , Including soetone, synthetio rubber and even ordinary alcohol, whtoh can no* be rasde from petroleum, and Just as I have ventured no aueaa ao to when and how the atom will become an important source of energy so I shall rua-ce no attempt to forecast what products, and In what proportions, and whether for peace or war - but lot's hope for peace - we shall then be ■.King from this wonderful mineral oruds oil.
