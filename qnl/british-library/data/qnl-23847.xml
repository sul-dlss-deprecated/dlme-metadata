Dear Sirs, TAURUS EXPRESS Travellers by the above route at this time of year, would be well advised to use the Nairn Pullman Service on Mondays, via Damascus to Beyrout and Tripoli and thence by train. This offers a pleasanter journey than the train and auto journey to Tel Kotchek via Kirkuk, Mosul, etc. The total time of the journey and the fares are approximately the same. fhe Nairn Pullman, however, usually leaves Baghdad fully booked, so that sufficient notice should be given us by intending travellers.

I understand from Smith you were asking regarding the above programme and copy^already with you, if the Fast Service was going to be dis-continued, the above will give you a fair indication as we officially know the situation.

August ^^ 9 1948* 4'Jf •f The Manager, Messrs* Gray, Mackenzie 4 Co* Ltd*, Bahrain* Dear Sir, It has come to my notice during the course of some police investigations that when the Nakhudas of your barges receive goods from steamers they do not give any sort of receipt to the tally clerk for the goods which they take on board their barges. It is therefore impossible for any check to be made of the contents of the barges until their contents are landed at the customs pier* Presumably the tally clerk on the steamer keeps a record of the contents of each barge and checks it on arrival at the customs* The Bahrain Government has, as you know, recently set up a police post at Sitra and a police launch patrols the sea around Sitra and between Sitra and the bridge. Police officers will in future go on board and inspect barges while they are carrying cargo from Sitra to Manama. I suggest that in future your Nakhudas should be in possession of a paper showing how many bales or cases they are conveying from steamer to shore. # , | LI m• PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN. d November 1948 Dear Agency^^^^ HRAl l! 1 As mail notices of ships from Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co.
