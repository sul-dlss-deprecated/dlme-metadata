There is a patch of harium in the fundus, probably the result of external pressure, and the dudenal cap is irregular also due to external pressure. A picture taken five hours after the meal shows the barium in the small intestine, caecum, ascending and trans- •verse colons. The appendix cannot be visualised, the caecum is distorted and there appears to be a little dilficulty in pass-* -ing the ilio-colic junction. A picture after 24 hours shows the caecum still to contain a patch of barium, and to be deformed. Most of the meal has been passed. The series suggest chronic appendicitis causing distortion of the caecum and pyloro—duodenal junction by adhesions.

Sultan refuses to 'be operated on in India and proposes proceeding at the end of this month via France to England, where he has indicated desire to 'be treated as guest of Government and if possiole accorded audience by His Hajesty. He will meet journey expenses himself and will he accompanied 'by THOMAS, his Wazir, who is proceeding on six months leave. Resident considers Sultanas absence will not matter for the moment and the sooner he goes and returns the better. liVe agree that in the circumstances it would 'be difficult to oppose the Sultan's journey and recommend that if there he no objection Sultan should he treated as State guest, entertainment 'being charged against Government Hospitality Fund as in the case of the visit of Shaikhs from Bahrain, Kuwait and Nejd in 1919. On the latter precedent suitable pBEiod would perhaps be one month. • Do H.M*s. Government approve ?
