ROUTES IN PERSIA,' 1942 VOL. 2. MINOR ROUTES M.T. ROUTE NO. 8 KANGAVAR—JOKAR via TUISARKAN This route is a by-pass from Route I-B. to Route 1-E. by-passing HAMADAN. General Report (Date : June, 1942) p. 46 1. Classification. — This has been partly convened into an A.l road, except in the TAHIRABAD area, where it is generally B.l, but passing places have been made at frequent intervals. Average width, 20—22 ft. Work was stopped on this road in July, 1942, in favour of Route 9 via NEHAVEND. Route 8 can be used by convoys up to 15th November, if one-way traffic is arranged during their passage. 2. Surface and Grading.—Well-metalled throughout; plenty of metalling is available along the route. The gradients and culverts on the pass from Miles 34.8 to 40 should not be an obstacle to 10-ton trucks. 3. Character of adjacent country —Up to Mile 29 the road passes through flat and partly cultivated country, and, in dry weather, a good deal of cross-country movement is possible anywhere, but there are a good many irrigation ditches; no cover from air in this section. From Mile 29.2 to Mile 41.5 the country isPage 2 Interim Amendments. Route No. 8 mountainous and broken, and vehicles could only leave the road for short distances. Round TUISARKAN and SARAB are many trees and tree-lined gardens, whic i would give cover. The rest of the road crosses the flat, partly cultivated N 1 KLABAD plain, where there is no cover and good “ going ” in dry weather. 4. Climatic effects.—The TUISARKAN pass is liable to be snowbound in winter. p. 47 p. 48 Detailed Report The mileage of the report is excessive. That given below is believed to be nearer the truth. 1/4 inch Sheet 1.39G. (9.B of January, 1942). Miles 3.6 Fork right from Route I-B.; NO sign post. Road skirts the impassable foothills at North edge of KANGAVAR plain.

Good “ going on both sides off road. 17 5 Summit of BAQIRABAD Pass. Easy descent from pass —hilly, but easy “going” on both sides. 18.6 Road crosses small deep wadi. Track goes off to right. (See Appendix “A” to Route 8 .)Interim Amendments. Route No. 8. Appendix “ A ” Page Miles 19.1 22.2 26.0 End of descent. Well-cultivated plain. Road skirts flank of small rounded hill on left and re-enters plain. One-arched stone and masonry bridge over AB-I-TUISARKAN. Bridge B.l—about 6 ft. of clear running water (June, 1942). Diversion possible with a little preparation. Culvert over irrigation channel, 8 ft. deep x Enter TUISARKAN. Narrow streets between high-walled gardens. End of TUISARKAN. One-arch brick bridge (A.l); diversion difficult. Road continues between tree-lined gardens. SARAB (1897) — small village with gardens. Ascent to pass begins by easy gradient. One-arch masonry bridge (A.l); diversion difficult. Steep ascent begins by a series of well-constructed hairpins. Delaying point. Summit of pass. Descent easy at first, but becomes steeper. DULAI. Undulating, but tankable country. Descent continues down flank of hill with rocky outcrops. QISHLAQ (2888) on right. Road enters NIKLABAD Plain. Old track, KANGAVAR—JAMIUABAD, joins from right. (See Appendix “A” to Route 8.) Ford, 3 ins.—6 ins. deep (June). Irrigation channel runs on right of road- 8 ft deep x 8 ft., with high banks. Road runs on a causeway, crossing irrigation channel by a culvert. JOKAR (3886) — small village surrounded by- gardens. Junction with Route I-E (IV-D ) RAMADAN—MALAYIR. ' Appendix “ A ” to Route No. 8 KANGAVAR to JOKAR (20.7 Miles) Ref.: 1/4-inch Sheet 1.39.G. (9.B of January, 1942). NOTE.

Date of reports: December, 1941, and January, 1942. General Report 1. Classification.—B.2. NOT all-weather road. Average width, 15—20 ft. Road not at present fit for convoys, but could easily be made so. 2. Surface and Grading—Enrih throughout, gravelled in sections. The last 5 miles are soft, and would be difficult after rain. 3. Character of Adjacent Country. —The hills are steep, but not impassable. The two valleys between FARSFIJ and JAMILABAD are thickly cultivated and much intersected by nullahs. 4. Wafer.—Plentiful. Detailed Report Miles 0.0 FARSFIJ (J.0291). Strong brick bridge over AB-I- TUISARKAN. (Probably easily reached from Mile 18.6 of Route 8.) Soon after crossing, the road runs for 1/4 mile along a shelf and drops into a nullah bed. Road, much washed away, runs along left bank of nullah. 4.0 Country cultivated or scrub. Road forks for new alignment, but bridge not yet built for new track. 4.2 Road crosses stream and rises steadily to a pass; road in bad condition. 6.7 Top of pass; steep descent into cultivated valley. 7.2 Road crosses stream and two nullahs in next three miles. 11.4 JAMILABAD (.1.1783) to right. Road rises. 13.7 Cross saddle and descend into thickly cultivated plain. In plain road is a mere track, crossed by irrigation ditches. 16.0 ISHQABAD (J.2584). Road passes between avenues of trees. Now rejoins plain. Very bad stretch of sandy road across plain covered with scrub and irrigation ditches—often a mere track and probably impassable in wet weather. Deep unbridged nullah, requiring detour, near ISHQABAD. Rejoins Route 8 at Mile 44.8. 20.7Interim Amendments. Route No. 9 Page 1 M.T. ROUTE NO. 9 KANGAVAR to Mile 272 on Route IV.C via NEHAVEND (59.8 Miles) {New Route) NOTE. —There are two alternative exits from KANGAVAR. (1) From a point 1/2 mile West of KANGAVAR (H.7191), via FIRUZABAD (H.7685)—a rough track, impassable in wet weather. (2) Via SULTANABAD (H.7486) to junction with Route 9 at H.8280. The first mile or two of this is often impassable owing to muddy irrigation ditches. Both these are bad and should not be used. Map: 1/4-inch Sheet I.39.G. (9.B of January, 1942). General Report 1. Classification.—It is proposed to convert this into a convoy route by the end of 1942; at present, from Mile 9 to NEHAVEND, a C.2 road, passable to light M.T. only, with difficulty in places. From NEHAVEND to Mile 272 on Route IV-C., A.l, and passable by all M.T. 2. Adjacent Country. —Mostly rolling country, flanked by hills. Dispersion off the road is possible except over irrigated areas and near villages. 3. Water. —Plentiful. 4. Camp Sites. —Practically anywhere. Detailed Report Miles 0.0 KANGAVAR. Take HAMADAN road and turn off, following Route 8. 7.0 Leave Route 8 at track junction H.8494 and go S.E. by €.2 track—very bad and bumpy. 8.G GAUDIN (H.8393)—to East.

(See Appendix “ B ” to Route 11.) 95.2 Road between the two summits may easily be impassable after rain. An alternative track exists lower down which is easily passable for vehicles up to 30-cwt., except where two streams cross it. 107.2 Narrow approaches to new bridge. Old bridge still exists but is falling to pieces. Diversion possible down stream.Page 2 Interim Amendments. Route No. 11. Appendix “ A ” Appendix “ A ” to Route No. 11 OURVEH—BIJAR via KHOSROABAD (46.0 Miles) 1. Classification.—B.2, dry weather only and not fit for vehicles above 15-cwt. 2. Alignment. — Various tracks are possible: (i) via SEHRISHABAD (C.5474), (ii) from point C.3373. But that given below is probably the normal one. Detailed Report Miles 0.0 CHAMAGULI. Mile 68 on Route 11. 4.7 HULUZAGACH (C.3679). 4.8 Two tracks meet; bridge (15-cwt. only) over stream. Diversion could be improvised. 13.7 ABBASABAD (C.3891). Cross - country movement impossible after this point. 14.5 Eight-arch brick and stone bridge. One way only, but fit for all types of vehicles. Various nullahs are crossed in the next ten miles. 26.9 Ford, with stony bottom. 27.0 KHOSROABAD.

The country beyond is broken and boulders must be removed in places. Recce, as far as BIJAR is not yet available, but there is a track right, along the river, which joins the HAMADAN—BIJAR road.Interim Amendments. Route Ho. 11. Appendix “ B ” Page 3 Appendix “ B ” to Route No. 11 SENNEH (SANANDAJ) to BIJAR via MIRAKI and KHAN EH QULI (62.5 Miles) NOTE:—No full and accurate account of the track is available. The following account of one attempt to follow the track, with notes of the time taken, is, therefore, included in place of the standard report. General Report 1. Classification.—B.2, dry weather. Impassable to all vehicles for some days after heavy rain. 2. Character of Adjacent Country—Wide dispersal is possible over the whole route. As far as SARAB the country is open, cultivated and flat. After SARAB the nullahs become more numerous and deeper, but A.F.Vs. could operate off the road as far North as about Mile 35. After this the nullahs have very steep banks and crossing would be difficult. 3. Supply facilities :— (i) Camp sites: Almost anywhere for any number. (ii) Water: Abundant but contaminated. (iii) Communications: NO telephone line, but visual signalling would be easy. 4. Alignment. —See 1/4-inch Sheet I.38.F. (Ed., June, 1942). Detailed Report Miles Place Map.

ROUTE NO. 14 HAMADAN to ZENJAN via KABUTARAHANG No information is available about Miles 100 to 120 but the following particulars from Miles 120—160.5 date from June, 1942. Detailed Report (1/4-inch Sheet J.395 of August, 1940) Miles 120 approx. Track junction about Pt. K.7914 (some 2.2 miles South of MAZIDABAD, and NOT at MAZIDABAD, as shown on map). Three alternative routes radiate from here:— (A) N.E. via DEH JALAL (K.8728) and SUIT AMY EH (S'.9643). A good earth dry-weather track; A.l in the plains, where complete dispersion is possible; B.l in the hill section, where limited dispersion is only occasionally possible. At one point (Mile 12.2) it is doubtful if the track could be used at present by M.T. over 15-cwt. Road runs through great open plain; full dis persion; 25 m.i.h. 126.1 Large pond to right. 129.5 DEH JALAL. Road climbs into hills; 12 m.i.h. 130.0 Narrow timber culvert over nullah (15-cwt. limit, but diversion easy). 130.2 A similar culvert. 131.4 Short descent into valley. Track in good condition. 131.8 Pt. 7645 on left. 1322 The track here is probably at present not fit for lorries above 15-cwt. 132.4 Small spring on hillside to left of road. Re-enter rolling hills. 132.9 Large open valley; road descending. 133.2 Brick culvert over nullah; steep descent. 134.3 Track rough and stony, running beside stream—as marked on map—dispersion impossible, 8 m.i.h. 134.8 Road descending rapidly from hills; good wide track; 15 m.i.h. ASADABAD village 1 1/2 miles to right. Road clear of hills and runs across plain.Page 2 Interim Amendments. Route No. 14 Miles 139.0 SULTANIYEH. Large blue dome of ruined Mosque is a conspicuous landmark for miles. Follow track round right-hand edge of village; 5 m.i.h. Tracks on map here are all wrong. 140.3 Rickety stone bridge (10 ft.) over nullah. 140.7 Stone bridge on wood foundation (12 ft.) over nullah. 144.0 Reach main road KAZY1N—ZENJAN (Route XIII) at Mile 85, by QARARL'LAQ railway bridge. (B) North and N.W. via KHVBRAM DA HR EH (A\7842). This is the track as shown on the map to BULAMAJI (Mile 131.9), CHINGURU, KHURRAM DARREH (Mile 139.4), and RAHMIN (Mile 146.6). This has been abandoned as an M.T. route owing to very bad nullah crossings at 7842 and 7158, and for all practical purposes the road is impassable to M.T Total distance, 39.9 miles. A new alignment has been cut for parts of the KHURRAM DARREH—ZENJAN stretch, and, if the necessary nullah crossings were constructed, the whole route would become A.2, dry weather. (C) N.W. and then North—not on map. This is a good earth track; A.l on plains, A.2 in hills. It runs N.W. along the Northern foot of the mountains to a point about K.6524 and then due North across the plain to OGHLBEIT (not on map but approx. K.6745). Detailed report from here onwards.

Miles 31—57.6: C.2 dry weather only. Miles 57.6—98.4: B.l all weather (except after heavy rain). Practically no vehicles pass over Miles 0—57.6, which is appalling, but laden 3-ton lorries did pass over the whole route in June, 1942. It is better to use Route 16-A. (RAZAN—NUBARAN) instead of this section. Miles 31—57.6 are so bad that they should not be attempted by inexperienced drivers. 2. Surface and Grading .—There is neither proper metalling nor maintenance, though a little gravel has been thrown over the road when it is found nearby. The rest of the surface is a packed earth or dust road. Culverts are all weak and narrow. 3. Character of adjacent country .—Miles 0—31 are a flat earth plain with a little cultivation and cover only near the few villages. Good “ going ” in dry weather only. Miles 31 to 57.6 are very broken and rough country with rocky outcrops—uninhabited until DUKHAN at Mile 43. Impassable in wet weather and with no cover. M.T. could get off the road, but only travel short distances and that with difficulty. From NUBARAN (Mile 57.6) the road runs first over a wide undulating plain with good “ going ” everywhere, climbs an easy pass at Mile 83.2, and descends into a flat stony valley, which broadens into the SAVEH plain. Maps: 1/4-inch Sheet I.39.B. (December, 1941)is quite inaccurate, and a new edition is being prepared. Detailed Report Miles p. 78 2.0 FAIZABAD. Leave village to right.

ROUTE NO. 17 SAVEH to TEHRAN Distance: 83 miles. Reference: 1/4-inch Sheets:—I.39.C. (of May, 1940) and I.39.D. (of August, 1940). Date of compilation: June, 1942. Authority: Advance G.S.I., TEHRAN. NOTES 1. The route followed is more direct than the suggested route in the General Report. It appears to be little used until the Trans-Iranian Railway is crossed at Mile 34.6. 2. Contrary to para. 1 in the Route Book, nothing has been done between SAVEH and RUDKHANEH-I- SARUD to make it into a motor road. 3. Throughout this report the route is referred to as a road, though in many places it is hardly even a track. This is done so as not to confuse it with the many genuine tracks that cross and join it. General Report p. 85 1. Classification. Mile 0 to Mile 8.1: B.l. All weather if not too wet. Mile 8T to Mile 15.4: C.2 inclining to C.l. All weather. Mile 15.4 to Mile 21: B.l. All weather. Mile 21 to Mile 33.6: C.2 inclining to C.l. Dry weather only. Mile 33.6 to Mile 83: B.l. All weather. From Mile 0 to Mile 21 vehicles rarely use the road. Mile 8.1 to Mile 15.4 is very rough going and in experienced drivers should not attempt it. A 3-ton lorry has passed over this section unladen. 2. Surface and Grading. —Little or nothing has been done to maintain this road, though some metalling and gravel has been put down in places between Miles 33.6 and 83. From SAVEH to PINAJIRD the desert surface is hard and pebbly, while through the passes over the GARDAN-I-RANGREZ range the road is stony. From Mile 21 to Mile 33.6 the road is mainly earth and would easily become impassable in wet weather. 3. Character of adjacent country—T \\q road on leaving SAVEH crosses a flat, pebbly desert, with aPage 2 Interim Amendments. Route No. IT few hamlets within gardens scattered about it. At Mile 8.1 the road ascends and crosses the GARDAN-I- RANGREZ range by a series of easy small passes. The country here is desolate, waterless, uninhabited, very broken in character, with numerous outcrops of rock and steep inclines. After crossing the range the road follows the bed of a dry wadi which soon opens out into a large, flat pebbly desert, which continues as far as PINAJIRD. A.F.Vs., etc., could operate over a wide front in this area. At PINAJIRD cultivation begins and continues spasmodically as far as the RUDKHANEH-I-SARUD. This area is often cut up with irrigation ditches and bunds and cross-country going is restricted. After crossing the railway at Mile 34.6 the road continues over open pebbly desert, climbs the side of a low range of barren hills, which would not be an obstacle to tanks. On reaching the summit the road continues over open desert—good all- weather going. Thence it crosses the RUD-I-SHUR, which lies in a valley about 3/4 of a mile wide, which is flanked by almost impassable bare hills and cliffs. Diversion would be difficult here on large scale. On chmbing out of the valley the road continues over open desert to SHAHRYAR, where it enters the cultiva tion which continues to TEHRAN. Cfbss-country travel for wheeled vehicles would be difficult here on account of numerous bunds and irrigation ditches. There is no cover from air until SHAHRYAR is reached, thereafter a little cover could be obtained in the gardens which often flank the road. 4. Climatic effects. —Hot, dry summers and cold winters. Snow lies on the GARDAN-I-RANGREZ for short periods. 5. Exceptional features .—The perpendicular banks of the KEREJ CHAT are a complete obstacle at Mile 67.9 should the bridge over it be destroyed. A diversion of many miles would be necessary before a suitable crossing place could be found. 6. Repair facilities.—Road metal and gravel is available in the GARDAN-I-RANGREZ area and again near the RUD-I-SHUR, otherwise supplies are scarce. From SHAHRYAR to TEHRAN small supplies of poplars are available. Little labour is available until PINAJIRD is reached, thereafter it would be fairly plentiful all the way to TEHRAN.Interim Amendments. Route No. 17 Page 3 7. Supply facilities — (i) Camping Available along the whole route. (ii) Wafer.—Fairly plentiful in the cultivated areas from kanats and ditches, and in some of the villages from wells. The desert areas are waterless. (iii) Supplies .—SAVEH has a small bazaar and small supplies of foodstuffs are always available; little or nothing could be found in the villages until SHAHRYAR is reached, thereafter they appear more prosperous. (iv) Faef.—None except for a few poplars in the cultivated areas. (v) Petrol and oil.—A few tins of each in SAVEH. otherwise none until TEHRAN is reached. (vi) Repair facilities .—A few inexperienced black smiths at SAVEH, otherwise none until TEHRAN is reached. Detailed Report Miles 0.0 SAVEH (E.8oo7).

Classification. —Can be used only by light M.T. in dry weather only. Last 10 miles B.2 metalled. 2. Surface and Grading. —The track largely follows donkey tracks, which are usually the shortest distance between villages and, for the first few 7 miles, runs over sandy plain cut up by nullahs. After HAVEH, at Mile 23.6, the track crosses stony desert and for the last 10 miles there is metalled B.2 road joining the QUM—TEHRAN road. There are no steep gradients. 3. Character of adjacent country. —From Mile 0 to Mile 23.6 the track crosses a sandy plain much broken up by irrigation channels and dotted with villages. Operations off the road would be easy in dry weather, but the numerous ditches would slow M.T. movement. From Mile 23.6 to Mile 46 the track crosses a stony, water less, barren plain. Movement off the road is easy over a very wide area and a speed of 15 m.i.h. is possible. Owing to the stony nature of the plain it would be difficult for aircraft to land and undue wear would be caused to tank tracks. After Mile 46 the road drops through sandy hills to QUM Plain, which appears marshy and would restrict movement off the road to the Tight. 4. Climatic effects. —The track would be quite impassable in wet weather. 5. Exceptional features. —At 10.4 an 8-arch brick bridge over the dry bed of the MAZDAQAN CHAT A track could be made over the river bed with little difficulty and this is preferable to using the bridge, the Northern approach of which is dilapidated and difficult. 6.

The mute to KHALAFARAD is that shown on map H.39A (May, 1942), as running on the West side of the railway until the level-crossing at Mile 6 (Y.5435), but the ferry at K H A L A F A R A I) has been moved about a mile upstream. The network of roads on the plain South of AGHA JARI is not wholly accurate, and the KHAIRARAD River is crossed farther to West (Approx. H.39.I/A.1661). For the present the road continues straight ahead to DOGUMRADAN at road junction H.39.1/A.5045, where it joins the road to the GACHSARAN aerodrome, which is not marked on the map. 3. Bridges. —There is also a withdrawable bridge over the R. ZUHRA, which can make the road impassable (Mile 185.5). 4. Character of Adjacent Conntrg.—For the first 97 and the last 20 miles the road crosses flat desert, and -movement off the road is easy in any direction. This is true also of the plains of BEHREHAN, LEISHTAR and DOGUMRADAN. In the hill section (Miles 97—120. 130—144 and 155—235) movement off the road is almost -impossible and it is usually commanded from both flanks. Demolition in these sections, especially on the “ Golden Staircase ” (Mile 180.2 onwards), would effectively delay an advance. Cover from the air is almost non-existent. 5. Climatic Effects.—Up to Mile 98 the road is impassable after the first rains and remains closed until -summer is well advanced. Though the rest of the road is all-weather, traffic is liable to be held up by spates at the frequent. Irish crossings and particularly at the ZUHRA Bridge (Mile 185.5). Culverts are frequently washed away by floods, and two bridges betweenPage 2 Interim Amendments. Route No. 32 KHAIRABAD and GACHSARAN were still out of com mission in July, 1942, as a result of the last rains. Landslides may block the road in the hill sections, but snow is practically unknown. The heat in summer is intense, and malaria, etc., common. 6. Supply Facilities .— (a) Water .—Available in small quantities from the villages along the route except between Miles 193—235, and in large quantities from the Rivers JARRAH1, MARUN, KHAIRABAD and ZUHRA Also at A.I.O.C, centres and at BEHBEHAN. (b) Supplies .—Grain is produced in sufficient quantity for local consumption only. Meat on the hoof is scarce in summer and fruit is always scarce. (c) Fuel.-—Very scarce except between Miles 144 and 1(52, where there is low scrub. (d) P.O.L .—Available in quantity at A H W A Z, KHALAFABAD, AGHA JARI, GACH SARA.N and GANAWEH; small stocks from agent at BEHBEHAN.

ROUTE NO. 33 BEHBEHAN to KAZERUX A reliable report, dated March, 1942, makes it quite clear that it is impossible to proceed by car from BEHBEHAN to KAZEREN since the bridge over the R. FEHLIAN has never been begun, and this river is at all times impassable to M. 1. The road leaves Route 32 at H.39.I/A.5145, and has been recently improved into a bad D.W. road, fit for 10-ton lorries as far as DO GUMBADAN (A.5744). The section from there to the R. FEHLIAN, once motorable in dry weather, has not been maintained for a number of years and is probably not passable to M.T. A new R.C. bridge was built by SENTAB (one span of 53 m., total length 105 m.) in 1937/38, in the defile known as the TANG-I-BARIN, which is believed to be in this section, but is not traceable on the map. This bridge is still without road approaches. The R. FEHLIAN is impassable. From the South bank of the R. FEHLIAN to the pass (TANG- I-MULLAH NAL) H.39 P/B.3700, the road is rough but passable to light M.T. in dry weather. From B.3700 to the R. SHAPUR the road is passable but would need widening for heavy M.T. The ford over the R. SHAPUR (there is no bridge) is difficult, owing to large boulders. From R.

From Mile 8 to 11.5 the road traverses a broad, flat plateau, on which all arms could operate, and the bottom of the MAYU Valley is broad and flat enough for limited operations off the road from Mile 16 to 28, except for a short distance at Mile 24. 4. Climatic Effects—Spates in spring and snowfall in winter may block the road occasionally, but seldom for more than a day at a time. None of nullah crossings shows marks of more than short-lived floods 4 ft. to 6 ft. deep. 5. Passes.—The only pass worth mentioning is the very stiff ALLABU AKBAR Pass (5786 ft.) over the HAZAR MASJID Range.

Surface and Grading. —The road is a well-made metalled road, opened in 1939, well engineered and with easy gradients. The only steep sections are the first four miles of the descent from the ZARDANEH Pass and Miles 69—73. The road is in good condition (June, 1942), and is fully bridged to a capacity of 20 tons. 3. Character of Adjacent Country. — The road traverses a barren plateau with dispersal possible for a considerable distance to either side, until the beginning of the ascent to the ZARDANEH Pass at Mile 29. Dispersal is generally possible all the way to the top of the pass for at least a short distance to either side. From Mile 44 onwards the road is generally on the slope at the side of a valley and little, if any, dispersal is possible until the plain is reached four miles before SHAHPASAND. The hills are bare until Mile 44, when occasional trees border the valley. From Mile 53 to Mile 63 the valley is well cultivated, but the slopes are bare. From Mile 68 to the end of the NAUDEH Valley the slopes are covered with forest. 4. Climatic Effects.—The highest point is the top of the ZARDANEH Pass (7,621 feet) and this pass and the KHUSH YAILAQ saucer are probably blocked byPage 2 Interim Amendments. Route No. 98 snow during parts of the period December to March. If necessary, however, it should be possible to keep the road open all the year round. This was done during the winter of 1941/42. 5. Exceptional Features.—The. three bridges at Miles 29, 55 and 73 are all considerable structures, but their demolition would occasion very slight obstacles to movement. Otherwise there are numerous single arch bridges or large culverts. The only good delaying points are at Miles 44—45 and* about Miles 68—72. This latter section is prone to landslides and the road is cut out of the side of a very thickly wooded, though not very steep, hillside. 6. Supply Facilities: (i) Camping Grounds.—Good sites at Miles 29, 53 and 73, where water, in limited quantities, is available. At Mile 43 there is a good site, but witn no cover, if water is available, as seems probable. (ii) Fuel.—Scarce except from Mile 65 onwards. (iii) P.O.L .—There is none to be had except at SHAHRTD, nor are there any tea houses. 7. General Note .—This is perhaps the easiest route over the ELBURZ Ranges and it is the shortest approach from the Caspian to N.E. Persia. It should be classified rather as a major than a minor route and is of very considerable strategic importance. Detailed Report Sheet J.40.T. Miles 0.0 SHAHRUD (5284).

Apparently water is to be had here for the digging. Landing ground sites available to right. Road climbs a low watershed- mountains half a mile to right—and descends into a valley just where it emerges into the Central Iranian Plateau. 29.0 Stone bridge of four 10-metre spans, total length 47 metres. The river bed was dry in May. Road turns left sharply and enters valley, keeping between the watercourse and steep hills to East (? 8321). 33.0 New (unused) Road Department House. Valley narrows to about 70 yards with untankable hills at either side. 34.0 Valley broadens again. Road ascends the ZARDANEH Pass through rolling downland between high hills; valley about half a mile wide. Dispersal possible. 39.0 Top of ZARDANEH Pass with a wide prospect over the ZARDANEH basin (not marked on map), a saucer-like depression (once a lake bed), about 1 mile across. In the middle of the saucer is KHUSH YAILAQ (“ Healthy summer quarters ”) village with a rest house (not in use). Road descends for 41/2 miles the Western slopes of this saucer, an indented road with a single-arch bridge at the elbow of each contributory valley. If these bridges were blown A.F.Vs. could descend into the saucer directly down the easy slopes. 43.5 Road turns on its tail on reaching the bottom of the saucer, passes KHUSH YAILAQ, and crosses the whole downland plateau. 44.25 One-arch bridge at Eastern extremity of saucer.

Route No. 98 Miles 50.5 51.8 53.8 56.3 60.3 63.5 66.0 67.5 The road descends very gently, keeping on the West slope of a narrow valley, the bottom of which is grassy and possible for A.F.Vs. The side slopes in the lower part of the valley are not impassable, but there is too much scrub and tree growth from Miles 45 to 48. Valley 100—200 yards wide. TILABAD (TILAVAR), a considerable mud village quarter mile to right (0345), where a broad valley comes in from N.E. There is a modern outpost of the village on the road. Ample water. Road descends NAUDEH Valley to N W varying from 100 to 300 yards wide and under cultivation, mostly wheat. Very barren sides. Valley forks. Stone bridge; single 35 m. span; total length 60 m.; roadway 7 m. No serious obstacle if demolished. Hamlet. The road now follows the Eastern side of the valley, keeping about 20 ft. above the level of the cultivation, which continues in terraces for about ten miles. For the first six miles it is about 1/4 mile broad. Cultivated valley goes off to right for about half a mile, with a considerable village (7 PARSIAN) on the crags at the end. There is a small modern outpost of the village on the road. Valley widens for about 2 miles but side slopes remain bare. Several wadis converge from the East, but the road crosses them by single-arch bridges which would make no obstacle if demolished. Cultivation in valley (here 100—200 yards wide) ends. Stream bed here is perhaps passable to A.F.Vs., but it later becomes too cluttered with boulders. Scrub begins on hill sides. Numerous single-arch bridges over dry watercourses (May) in this section. The valley makes a bend to the right, and the road with it. A minor valley goes off to the left (8847). In the next two miles treesInterim Amendments. Route No. 98 Page 5 Miles begin to make their appearance on the slopes and the verdure steadily thickens into a forest growth. Numerous single-arch bridges in next two miles. The road keeps on the slope above the valley level but gradually descends. 69.5 Road reaches level of valley bottom. 70.0 Single-arch stone bridge, 40 ft. long, over gully. Road begins to ascend through woods rather steeply. The next two miles would make the best delaying positions in the route. The track winds tortuously along a fairly steep, thickly-wooded slope, and the soil here is prone to landslides. The whole valley is thick forest and the narrow and boulder- strewn river bed is impossible for all M.T.; the stream itself is easily fordable. Road descends after two miles towards river bed. Map Sheet J.40 N. 72.8 Forest ends. Stone bridge across R. NAUDEH. One 65 m. and one 20 m. span; total length, 100.94 metres. The valley would be possible without difficulty if the bridge were demolished. The Northern approach to the bridge is embanked and the work here had not quite been completed in May, 1942. 73.8 A well-wooded valley goes off to right. Road descends widening NAUDEH valley (covered with scrub), and keeps to Western side. 75.0 UIJALI (?)—tidy village and orchard behind railings. 76.0 Valley ends and road reaches the well- cultivated plain which extends to the Caspian and the Russsian frontier.

General Report p.344 1. Classification. —Work on the road appears to have stopped in September, 1941, and the general remarks in the Route Rook still apply. The route is at present fit only for light M.T. and that with difficulty, but since a Chevrolet station wagon was able to cover the route in July, 1942, its importance cannot be overlooked, and it would present no difficulty to mountain troops. 2. Surface and Grading. —Where the new route has been finished, the road is generally A.l, without difficult gradients, but—for the most part—at present a service road is followed which is rarely better than C.2. 3. Character of Adjacent Country. —The road runs through steep gorges and along the edge of precipices. Except in the last 10 miles, movement off the road is practically impossible. Demolition would be effective almost anywhere. 4. Climatic Effects. —At present this is only a dry weather route, and it must be blocked by snow for weeks at a time in winter. 5. Supply Facilities: (i) Camping Grounds.—Suitable sites are rare, but some sort of site could be found wherever there is a village.
