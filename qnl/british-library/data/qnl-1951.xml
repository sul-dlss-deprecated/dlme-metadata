From—The Sirdar, Khartoum, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Following sent on November 4th to Foreign Office :— Begins. A long telegram has been received from Wilson reporting his conversations with Abdulla on November 1st and with Sheriff (by telephone) the next day regarding the assumption of regal dignity. Substance of these conversations is as follows :— (1) Declaration could hardly be unexpected by His Majesty’s Govern ment in view of the previous secret negotiations on the subject. Indeed Sheriff had been stvled King in a letter received from His Majesty’s Govern ment, but had replied that he was content with title of Emir. The declar ation had been deferred because of Sheriff’s anxiety to win His Majesty’s Government’s complete confidence and in order that success of this year’s pilgrimage might first become known to Moslem world. (2) Regal style was assumed by Sheriff in compliance with request of Sheikhs of Uedjaz. It will refute enemy reports regarding his dependence on Great Britain and is for good of his people and for Moslem world. He regards himself as King of Arabs and a religious leader, but has no intention of inter fering with Ibn Saud or other Arabian Ruling Chiefs. The boundaries of his kingdom were settled previous to revolt, and in this respect he has no other ambitions. (3) The question of Caliphate is left by the Sheriff to decision of Moslem world and he will not therefore open this question. (4) He very urgently requested formal recognition of new title bv His Majesty’s Government. Sheriff respects his Treaty with His Majesty’s Government and if his ally is dissatisfied with him is prepared to resign (the regal style ?). As he would never have consented to ally himself with another Power, he is anxious above all to remove any suspision of his good faith on the part of His Majesty’s Government in this and other matters. Wilson bad not then received instructions contained in your telegram to High Commissioner, No. 880. He now urges necessity for qualified recognition by His Majesty’s Government of Sheriff as King. Of Sheriff’s good intentions he has no boubt and considers that local effect of declaration in Hedjaz is good and that it will prove completely independent of any form of Turkish suze rainty. He recognises desirability of obtaining from Sheriff a formal reaffirma tion of his intention to leave the election of Calif to decision of Moslem world and to prevent an attempt by his subordinates or followers to raise this question prematurely. As a means of avoiding difficult question of title he suggests that His Majesty’s Government might recognise style “His Majesty the Sneriff ”.j54 This suggestion I do not c0 “ si ^* High Addressed to London Foreign Office; repealed High Commissioner, Cairo, No. 2.

You also stated that His Excellency was remarkable for his vast knowledge and great experience in regard to the present circumstances, &amp;c., and that big appointment will facilitate all our dealings and communications. At all events, I must before everything ask God to give us good luck and I beg to acknowledge and accept him in this capacity since the receipt of Your Excellency’s telegram. The buildings of the Consulate were handed over to him even before the receipt of your telegram. The good principle I have seen from His Excellency so far, make me ask God to give us both to work together hand in hand with sincerity. Both myself and His Excellency will work most zealously and honestly to obtain the high aims and ambitions that we bear in mind and I shall spare no pains to give to His Excellency all due consideration and esteem and I assure Your Excellency that I shall use no other channel and (in?) my dealings with Great Britain except him, because His Excellency will be con sidered the only means.

Cairo; 13th October 1916. My Lord, 1 have the honour to forward to you herewith copies of the following correspondence, which I have received from Colonel Wilson at Jeddah:— (а) Letter from the Sheriff, dated 13th Keida, to Colonel Wilson. (б) Letter from Colonel W ilson to the Sheriff, dated October 1st. I have sent copies of this correspondence to the Viceroy of India. I have the honour to be, My Lord, with the highest respect, Your Lordship’s mosCobedient, humble servant, A. H. McMahon. The Viscount Grey of Fallodon, K.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Translation of letter from the Sheriff to Wilson Pasha, dated 18th Keida 1334 (received 12th September 1916). His Excellency the British Agent in Jeddah, With great respect and pleasure I have received your letter, dated 11th Zilkeida (9th September 1916). We have understood what you have been informed of from Cairo that the Turks still have with them adherents from the tribes of the North who accompany them and supply them with camels. After thinking deeply of the matter we have found out what you have said is true yet the cause is not so. Being quite sure I tell Your Excellency that they have not taken ten or even one of our camels.66 * What we surely know is that there is a man called Ibn Feroan rom he inhab ants of Neid who made an agreement with the Commander of the Turks in Syria to prepare for them 1,200 camels by the beginning oE ^^ecTs’sary messages were written to some people who will nullify the mentioned efforts at any rate. . Their advance is owing to what they have brought with them of mule* and their own special camels from feyria. Our tribes South, South-West and East of Medina are still plundering them by fires and tens while they travel from Medina to their camps and also thev do the same in their camps. ’ The real cause is that the Turks are armed with the latest new arms and having plenty of big quick guns and the numerous maxims and every m w scientific war material recently invented. Having not advanced more than 100 kilometres besides being armed so strongly, the Turks show that they are strongly opposed by our troops and tribes who are short of such recent war mateiials. Anyhow it is worthv of consideration and deep thought the fear that these tribes may get weary and tired of the long opposition against the enemy while they are away from their families, whom they ha\e left without food, with no one else to give them food. Therefore we have to repeat our request which w*e have asked for two months ago, namely the supply of a trained disciplined force to help ours upon which they can rely and by means of which they can defend themselves from the effects of the preparations of the enemy. By this means there will he hope of success and victory in a short time and the men w ill be no more away from the means of obtaining their livelihood. The only cause of all this trouble is failure to break the railway decided in the contents of the Agreement. Being quite certain of what I have explained before to Great Britain that the Turks are going to make their best to bring the Holy Syrian Carpet in this pilgrimage season, accompanied by the Emir whom they have appointed, I repeat the request which I have asked for before. Thus I be 0 ’ a supply of at least three battalions, two of them to camp in Tanho and the 5 third inRabegh, for this has become of the utmost importance. If sending these battalions is going to be difficult and costly, this is the result of the delay of the advance towards the railway which should have been done with the utmost speed. I need not mention what wns clearly said by the representative, who was accompanied by Mr. Storrs and Hussein Rubi Effendi, when he was met by my son Zeid on board the ship in Badee harbour south of Jeddah before the revolt took place by five days, namely that 1G,000 soldiers and a great number of aeroplanes were at our disposal. Therefore we must repeat our request which we have mentioned before this and to ask for a warship and two aeroplanes to stay at Yanbo and another to be at Rabegh until the abovementioned forces arrive and the railway i« cut; this if Great Britain wishes to preserve us from the results of the present condition of affairs. It is true that Ibn Rashid strongly determined not to disobey the Turkish policy because he is an ignorant young man and is forced by some people who have obtained power over him and are not of his tribe. But he is also thinking that our progress may weaken the Turks. Me promised him much though it does not cause any effect upon him and we are going to promise him more. His treating and dealing wdth you while he was in Irak proves that. All the rest of the Syrian tribes: Anza, Shaalan, Fakir and Ayda are all with us, and now one of our own men (Sieyed Ali Ibn Oreid) is staying with Shaalan.I hope that, His Excellency the British Agent may answer me that the »b&lt;,vementioned requests will be carried out and quickly fulfilled. In the end I beg you to accept my great respect. HUSSEIN, Sheriff of Mecca, 13th Keida 1334. ( Copy.) Jeddah, let October 1916. To His Highness the Sheriff of Mecca, &amp;c. I have just received a telegram from His Excellency the High Commis sioner stating that His Excellency had received a telegram from Your High ness in which you refer to a telegram received Irom Sheriff Earuki who appears to have informed Your Highness that His Excellency the High Commissioner stated that it, was impossible for His Majesty’s Government to send troops to the Hedjaz for various reasons of which the most important were the fear that the world would misinterpret such action and that we believe the Turkish forces were weak. This is not quite correct and I am writing this letter to explain to Your Highness the existing situation and why troops have not been sent hitherto. At tl.e end of August when I had the honour of first meeting Your Highness’ son Sheriff Eaisal Bey, the situation appeared to be very serious for the following reasons :— (1) The Turks were said to be advancing on Rabegh in a few days’ time. (2) Report said that the Turkish Mahmal had arrived at Medina and that the enemy were determined to get it to Mecca for the holy pilgrimage festival. (3) Rabegh was in the hands of Sheikh Hussein who was a friend of the enemy and who had kept a large amount of food-stuffs at Rabegh instead of sending them to Ali Bey or Eaisal Bey, the idea being that these stores would be useful for the Turks when they arrived. (4) Taif was still in the hands of the enemy. (5) Eaisal Bey had no artillery. (6) Ali Bey with his army was on the Earse road, and it took a long time for communications to pass between him and Eaisal Bey. I suggested to Eaisal Bey (who entirely agreed) that Ali Bey’s Army should come to Rabegh as soon as possible leaving sufficient men behind to guard the Earse and Eastern pilgrim roads. To this proposal Ali Bey at once agreed. I also strongly urjred Your Highness to send a force to occupy Babegk which Your Highness did. At the same time I informed His Excellency the High Commissioner of the situation. Both His Excellency and His Majesty’s Government are, as I am sure Your Highness well knows, absolutely sincere in their intentions and efforts to help your noble cause in every way possible. The reason why no troops have been sent up to the present is because there are no Moslem troops available. The Egyptian Army is at present engaged in occupying the new territory of Darfur which we recently took and none can be spared and the Moslem troops in the Indian Army are too far off to be brought in time. The question of sending British troops was very carefully considered, and as Your Highness will doubtless recollect you were quite naturally and rightly not much in favour of Christian troops being landed in the Hedjaz but later Your Highness stated that you had no objection to about 300 British troops being landed as a guard to the aeroplanes and later on owing to the58 seriousness of the situation Your Highness ashed for 3,00 sent to Rabegh. As Your Highness 18 aware I went 3,000 British troops to to Esrvpt bv order of His ExUencyXHi^ fully on the situation and as a consequence His Excellency the Admiral Commander-In-Chief vis,ted RabeT 10 davs ago and some British officers are now there to make all arrangements fir troops should it be absolutely necessary to send them. The general situation has, however, very greatly improved. The Turks have retired tod,ear Bir Darwish and all reports given me by Sheriff Ah Bey and Tuiri Bey agree with the information in Cairo that the enemy are short of food and have bad transport. Rabegh is occupied by a strong force of Your Highness* Army. Taif has, thank God, been captured. Faisal Bey has now got a mountain Battery and Maxim guns of the Egyptian Army. The general morale of Your Highness troops is excellent and ^iuri Bey 1 assured His Excellency the Admiral and myself that he was quite confident he could defeat a division of Turks if they attacked Rabegh if he was sent some ■ guns; these I have urgently asked for, he will also have Said Pasha Ali and his Artillery very soon. The British Navy will protect the flanks of Ali Bey’s position if he is attacked. Sheriff Abdulla Bey’s army is also available now to join in the attack on the enemv and personally I am confident that under the leadership of Your Highness’ noble sons the traditional bravery of the Arab will bring about the complete destruction of the Turkish Forces and the capture of the Holy City of Medina from the enemy. I am quite sure that Your Highness will entirely agree that if this can be accomplished (as I think it can) by Your Highness* armies without any British Troops landing in the Hedjaz, it will be infinitely better for Your Highness and the noble cause for which you are fighting and give the lie to the'statements of Haidar Pasha and Your Highness’ enemies. I apologize for writing to Your Highness at such great length, but I wish to try and explain all the facts. I can assure Your Highness that His Majesty’s Government are entirely sincere in their efforts and intentions to assist, in every possible way, Your Highness’ cause. When everything is ready, Ali Bey proposes to advance and I confidently look, as he does himself, to an early and complete defeat of our common enemy. With the assurance of complete respects. Wilson Pasha. No. 261. The Residency, m 7 Cairo; 13th October 1916. My Lord, With reference to my despatch No. 250 of the 6th instant, I have the honour to forward herewith copies of a revised translation of the Proclama tion, therein contained, addressed by the Grand Sheriff to the people of Iraq, dated 11th Zii-Keida 1331. 1 have sent a copy of this revised translation to the Viceroy of India. I have the honour to be, My Lord, with the highest respect, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servant* The Tiscount Grey of Fallodon, K.G., &amp;c., &amp;C»| &amp;c. A. H. McMAHON.Translation of Proclamation by Sis Highness the Sheriff of Mecca. We have found it necessary to add the following lines to our former Pro clamation in explanation of it and to prevent any misunderstanding as to the real causes of our rising in the Iledjaz as mentioned in the said Proclamation. This will give to all respectable persons in the world and especially to Muham madans a better understanding of our intentions and purposes with reference to our existence as a people, slating only the most recent and simplest reasons. It is well known that all wise and deep-thinking Muhammadans in the Turkish Empire and all over the world are not pleased with the entry of the Ottoman Empire into the present war for important reasons agreed upon by them. One of these reasons is that the Ottoman Empire has just come out ■of the Italian and Balkan wars in which her armies, treasury revenue and general administration suffered such weakness and loss that it affected not only the Government but also the people. A Turkish soldier could hardly l;o hack to his village and commence looking after his family and maintaining it before he was called back to the Army. This was also the cause (? case) with every workman, porter or wood cutter. A nation whose individuals suffered such miseries sees very plainly the outcome when its Government throws itself into the abyss of a new war not like previous wars wuth heavy taxes from the incomes of miserable people on the commerce, arts and agriculture. This is one of the reasons that made the wise Moslem people disapprove of the entry of the Empire into the present war. It is a cause referring to the sake of the real case of the interior of the whole Empire. There are other exterior reasons w^hich refer to the reason that made the United Government to enter into the war against other nations. The Turkish Empire is a Moslem nation having separated parts and manv coasts; and the policy that has been followed by the Great Ottoman Sultanas long ages ago was to treat well and to keep connection with the countries w r hose divisions are inhabited by the greater part of the Muhammadans. Such countries still have the command over the sea. When the United Kingdom entered into war against these countries joining with another ambitious and covetous nation the wise and intelligent Muhammadans looked at it as an evil omen from what they understood of the bad results before they happened. I was one of these men when I was asked by telegram to give my opinion in this war. I answered giving the necessary advice and that is w r hat I relv upon as a proof of my sincerity to this country and my great desire of its safety and the preservation of Islam. What we were afraid would happen has now taken place and the Turkish Empire has come to the point of its annihilation and its boundaries in Europe to-day have come nearly within the walls of Constantinople while the Russian troops are capturing the Turks from the outskirts of Sewass and Musel, and the British are driving thousands of prisoners near Arish, after capturing Basrah and part of the Baghdad regions. He also will think deeply in such a case and see that the war is still taking place will no doubt understand that our result will be either to yield to this dangerous infliction till we disappear from the maps of the world or to try to rescue ourselves from it. We wull leave to the whole world to think of that and to answer it and we have not the least doubt that they will help us in our rising that has come in its proper time before the rest of this region will be surrounded with dangers such that we would be suddenly thrown away. We will never hesitate in our rising; and if we knew that our prolonged connection with this country which has become a plaything in the hands of her destroyers, could do her any good or maintain her possessions for her, we would have done nothing of w hat we have done. But that cannot and will not be because if we follow them where they are going we will vanish like other nations heard of.60 Yes • we say so and leave the judgment to the justice of the whole world, we cannot stay still and keep silent, but we say openly that the sole reason for the fall and dwindling of this country together with what remained of its possessions like Anatolia, simply because of the fal1 of the country into the * hands of parties whose chiefs are Anwar, Gamol and lalaat, and the departure ^ of the country from its right political lines which have been followed by the j| Great Ottoman Governor, namely, the friendship with the two great countries England and Erance. To understand the friendships, the sincerity and the faith of the^ chiefs of these parties, it is quite sufficient to know that they have recently signed the Agreement of the loan from France which they were in a very great need of and meanwhile they declared war against her and joined her enemy. We have chosen tins particularly to prove what we have mentioned because it is very famous and recent. In addition to that the inhabitants of the Turkish Empire, whether Moslems or not, suffer from oppression in justice and ill-treatment and especially from those who are taking hold of the Government now during this war. They have done the same with the inhabitants of Armenia and Erzerun and also with the people of Syria, Mesopotamia and elsewhere which is well known to us till now. There is also their attack on Awali near Medina where they ill-treated Arab women driving them into the camps of the troops which is against the Muhammadan religion and the honour of the Arabs. It is true that we have risen and are still rising showing open enmity against Anwar, Gamal and Talaat and their followers. Every wise Muhammadan should share with us in this even the indivi duals of the Royal Ottoman House itself; because they (Anwar, Gamal and Talaat) have murdered the head of the Royal House, the heir of tne throne and the great martyr the late Yussuf Erzzeddine, may God bless him. We have broken away from them showing enmity and hatred to them, we accompanied by all just and pious, the Muhammadans of the Turkish Empire and all the Moslem world because of the ruin they have caused and the dangers and weakness they have brought upon the Muhammadan people till the country of Islam has become the victim of their selfish aims. We leave them to God and know that it is a just word upon which we live and upon it we die. Why should we not say so. While we are ready to recount to our Moslem brethren throughout the world what has been done by the Turks so that it m.ay oe known and understood by all. Gamal Pasha, the Governor of Syria, has given orders to this Muhamma dan region to establish an assembly made up of women. He sent to tliis assembly asking for an invitation at its meeting. This was done in fact. He was present, accompanied by his civil and military staff and others invited from his followers and these Muhammadan women, members of the society took trouble in their hospitality and doing service to him. Then when the meeting was about to end, the women beuran to chant and recite speeches in front of the crowds of men. All the newspapers of Syria have published that expressing their pleasure, pride and vanity to please Gamal Pasha. O! Praise be to God who says in His Holy Rook ; O! Ye Prophet tell your wives, daughters and the women of believers to put all their dresses covering themselves in order not to be known and harmed. And in His Saving i tell the women of the believers not to attract notice, to take care of 'their honour and not to appear ornamented and adorned except before their husbands or fathers. It is plainly known and clearly understood then that the chiefs of these lurks mean to do with the religious laws of Islam and the Arab customs. I hope this may remind and advise the Muhammadans of the Ottoman Empire and all our brethren in the whole world not to let these wicked people (ontinue acting unlawfully against the sacted Laws of God and disobevins; His Orders in order that their salaries may be raised and their wealthincreased. A creature is not obeyed, while God is disobeyed. He who has the power to assist, this evil by hand or tongue or spirit or soul should do it aud he who is ready to oppose these rascals should come with us. May God pbnce us with those who hear the speech and follow its best for each of us is either on the right way or is led into the depth of error. 11th Zil’Qeida 133d. No. 263. 21st October 1916. My Lord, I have the honour to forward herewith copy of a despatch (No. 7), dated Jeddah, October 6th, which 1 have received from Colonel Wilson. The enclosures in this despatch refer to a certain amount of difficulty— eventually amicably settled—which the reconnaissance party of British officers encountered, when they first attempted to land at liabegh. 1 have sent a copy of this despatch and its enclosures to India.

(Despatch No. 7.) Sir, I have the honour to forward the following report for Your Excellency's information and attach copies of letters which may be of some interest. Hussein Effendi Ruhi left for Mecca on 2nd October, and he has given me the following information re I bn Saud and Ibn Rashid and the pilgrimage. Jbn Rashid. —Several heads of Ibn Rashid’s tribes are in Mecca now, Sheriff will have no dealings with Ibn Rashid himself as he is a hypocrite but is exerting all his energies to winning his tribes w ith some success. Ibn Saud. —Sheriff looks upon him as a friend and has no wish to interfere with any treaties made by His Majesty’s Government. Sheriff has been told by some people who came from Ibn Saud recently that the latter supplied the Turks with 1,500 camels through an agent of his in Syria. Sheriff w T ould like His Majesty’s Government to tell Ibn Saud that he should not do this, but at the same time admits the report may not be true. Pilgrimage .—Road between here and Mecca is very safe by day and night, and that as far as he has heard all the pilgrims are well looked after and are pleased with the arrangements made. Arms .—It is reported that several Egyptian pilgrims have bought tin ewers with false bottoms in which they propose to conceal revolvers on their return to Egypt. I suggest that the necessary authorities at Suez are warned and also for a look out to be kept for boxes of a similar nature. '1 urkish prisoners .—Ghalib Pasha with his personal staff and probably 21 officers and 665 rank and file leave in H. M. S. “ Northbrook ” to-morrow (details of which 1 will telegraph). The married officers are sent at the Sheriff’s special request and he wishes all officers to leave as soon as possible as the feeling of the Arabs is very bitter. Jeddah, 6th October 1916.62 4 j* t er&gt;nf folptrpqm rpoeived from Colonel Pari ^'er. In mv op^nionThe “relt essential is for the three Quick-Firing Mountain Batteries asked for to be sent, one or two if these are not possible, and tor the Bugade to be kept in readiness to leave Suez at the shortest poss.bknotice.

The Sheriff has decided not to send the letter and will reply himself. I understand Ruhi BMTendi will bring a copy with him. I do noi regret this course as I was not very anxious to be mixed up in the matter. ' Reference my telegram No. W.-250 of 6th October I asked for Your Excellency’s advice re (2) at the particular request of the Sheriff.

Telegram. “ Eox ” to Colonel Wilson. 1st October 1916. The difficulty about landing we hoped was settled has again arisen. Copy of telegram from'“ Hufferin ” will be sent you in morning, but if you will telephone to-night to get a letter sent down at once I will wait to take North lbi5. To His Highness the Sheriff, 1st October 1916. I have just received a letter from Colonel Parker who has been sent with other officers to arrange for the defence of liabegh, if it is necessary for British troops to be sent, to say that there is great difficulty about these officers* landing. If it should be necessary for British troops to land, it is absolutely essential that these officers should have absoluie freedom to laud in order to examine the water-supply and see what arrangements are necessary to make for supplying the troops with water, to fix ranges for the ships* guns and various otner matters, i must confess to Your Highness that I do not under stand what has occurred, as your son Sheriff Ali Bey answered me that British officers and men could land for their purpose and agreed that it was necessary. As it is a most important and urgent matter to get everything properly arranged in case British troops are sent, I beg Your Highness to kindly send me a letter for Ali Bey instructing him to allow these officers to land. This letter could be taken to Itabegh by H. M. S. “ Eox ” which leaves for there to-morrow afternoon, so 1 trust Your Highness will kindly send the letter so as to reach me by 4i p.m. to-morrow.If a few British officers and men are not allowed to land now to make all necessary arrangements, Your Highness will, I am sure, understand, that it will be impossible for British troops, for whom Your Highness has asked, to be landed later on if sent. YTT' T ▼ n/'vv T&gt; k O TT k To AH Bey. —There is a complaint that there are difficulties about estalish- ing the defences about which you have agreed with His Excellency the Ad- mfral and His Excellency Wilson Pasha, inform us of the facts. Bis Highness the Before sending the telegram Your Highness has sent to be forwarded to Ali Bey, might I suggest adding to it that British officers and men are to be allowed to land. The matter is urgent and when the ship leaves to-morrow, I will be unable to get any news from Rabegh for about three days. Wilson Pasha. Note by Ruhi. —His Highness has gone to bed and I told the Secretary not to send the message before the Sheriff adds to it “ British officers and men are to be allowed to land.” 9-30 p. m., 1st October 1916.

Colonel Parker, who was on shore, sent a message by Nuri Bey to Ali Bey, requesting him to come and see him, he has replied that he is unable to come (to-day), Sunday, but will come 8 a.m. (to-day) Monday. It is requested that Grand Sheriff be asked to give Ali Bey definite instructions regarding this matter. Reply by the Sheriff through his Secretary :— His Highness is going to send a message to Ali Bey to facilitate matters and allow British officers to do their work. The message will be in cypher and you can either send it by wireless or give it to the ship that is leaving Rabegh to-morrow. The message will be sent telegraphically. 1st October 1916.

My Lord, I have the honour to forward herewith copy of a letter addressed by Colonel Wilson at Jeddah to the Grand Sheriff, communicating to is High ness, as instructed in Your Lordship’s telegram iNo. 770 of September 23rd the Treaty of December 26tb, 1915, between His Majesty’s Government and Ibu Saud. 1 have sent a copy of this despatch and its enclosures to India.

Jeddah, 3rd October 1916. To His Highness the Grand Sherif and Emir of Mecca, &amp;c., After usual salaams.—I have the honour to forward herewith, in accord- ance with instructions received from His Majesty’s Government, a copy m Arabic of the treaty concluded between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud on 26tn December 1916. The Arabic is, of course, merely a translation by Hussein Effendi Ruhi of the English copy of the treaty and is not a copy of the original Arabic version. His Majesty’s Government by communicating to Your Highness this treaty gives a proof of its desire to * take Your Highness fully into its con fidence. Your Highness will doubtless remember that in the Agreement made with His Excellency the High Commissioner, Your Highness agreed that treaties made by His Majesty’s Government with Arabic Chiefs should be respected ; Your Highness will notice that there is nothing in this treaty Ibn Saud which is incompatible with the fulfilment of the engagements made by His Majesty’s Government with Your Highness. I am also instructed to inform Your Highness that His Majesty 8 Government is using its influence w ith Ibn Saud to persuade him to reader Your Highness all the assistance in his power. Your Highness some time ago informed me that you were in friendly communication with Ibn Saud and I would be much pleased if Your Highness would inform me how the matter of negotiations with Ibn Saud now stands.I would respectfully urs^e on Your Highness the great importance of coming to an agreement quickly. Your Highness also informed me that you had been corresponding with Ibn Rashid. Your Highness knows far better than I do the greatness of Ibn Rashid’s cupidity. If this can be satisfied and he can be brought over to Your Highness’ side the Turks will lose their chief source of camel supply and will have a trouble some enemy on their flank east of the railway. I mention above about Ibn Rashid because, from papers recently captured bv our Armv in Iraq, it is proved that the Turks are very afraid that ^.our Highness will win over Ihn Rashid to your cause, and they attach the greatest importance to keeping him with them. I have the honour to send Your Highness the sincere good wishes of His Excellency the High Commissioner, and beg you will accept my own for Your Highness’ noble cause. Wilson Pasha. No. 270.

I have the honour to request you to consider this present declaration as token of formal recognition by Serbian Government in reply to your telegram of 31st October, kindly informing me of election of Grand Sheriff Hussein Bin Ali as King of Arab Nation which becoming freed from yoke under which it has hitherto been oppressed, desires recognition as an active member of the community of nations with the noble aim of diffusing the blessings of learning and justice, throughout Arab regions. I beg Your Excellency to accept assurance of my respectful consideration wi^h sincere wishes for prosperous New Year.

Note regarding decree, dated October 23rd, published by Sheriff of Mecca ordering all Ottoman subjects to become naturalized Sheriffian subjects or leave country has been communicated by French Embassy. Applicationa for French or British protection have in consequence been received and Briand lias instructed Bremond to refuse French protection, urging Sheriff at the same time to confine himself to exacting a recognition of his authority and administration. Sheriff is also to be pressed by him to accept semi-official intervention of French and British Representatives in regard to the treatment of Ottoman and Foreign residents (until ?) he can institute regular administrative and judicial organization. Basis of French instruction, to refuse protection is that Sheriff’s action is in conformity with “ Mahomedan doctrine which places in subjection to local Sovereign every Mohamedan residing permanently in territory of that Sovereign ”.

Following 961 sent Sardar repeated to Foreign Office November 2nd Begins. My telegram of October 31st, No. 9 7. Ynnr views have not been received. You will have seen from subsequent telegrams that proposed message to Sheriff through Wilson is now mappro- priate. Check of publicity outside Hedjaz appears no longer possible. Only question for immediate consideration is nature and extent of our recogmUon of Sheriff’s action. In view of extent to which Sheriff owes his present position and even existence to our aid and support, we would he justified in withholding any recognition of his present action which has been taken without consulting us. To subject our relations to too severe a strain at present juncture would how- ever appear obviously undesirable. Most that we could do under existing conditions would be to recognise Sheriff as “ Malik ” of Hedjaz in view of limited extent of his dominion and having regard to our treaties acknowledging independence of Arab Chiefs such as Bin Saud, etc. My telegram No. 959 shows how he himself does not claim right to interfere with independence of Bin Saud. This much we might perhaps safely do. Our decision could be based on International usage which recognises King “in me” only and not “in posse”. In conveying this to him we should, I think, express surprise at his taking such drastic action without consulting His Majesty’s Government and point out how this action is likely to prejudice his position in eyes of certain Moslem countries where his policy and motives are still regarded with distrust. If considered desirable not to discourage him unduly His Majesty’s Government to continue efforts to bring about and support independence of Arab Nation. His Majesty’s Government are evidently awaiting your views before sending instructions. Matter is pressing. 80 Telegram P., No. 962, dated (and received) the 9th November 1916.

Following 963 sent to Foreign Office, November 3rd, repeated Sirdar:— J$pgins. Sirdar sends following 528 :— Begins. Your telegram No. 961, receipt of your telegram No. 947 dealing with proposed message to Wilson (which you now consider inappropriate) cannot bo traced. I think I understand situation ■ufficiently however to express a general opinion on attitude which might be adopted by His Majesty’s Government towards the Sheriff as to his assumption of this more or less regal dignity. In face of fait accompli I agree that it would be unwise to prejudice our future relations with him by withholding a measure of formal recognition, while expressing our opinion that his pro clamation would have been better timed if it had been made after expulsion of Turks from his territory. The title “ King of Arab Nation”, hardly appears to accord with Sheriff’s own declaration regarding complete independence of other Arab Chiefs within their own territories, and may accordingly defer their formal recogni tion of his new title. Hence we should in my opinion avoid quoting this title in all formal documents until its significance has been more precisely defined and formally approved by representative Arab Chiefs. As far as we are concerned “ King of Arabs in Hedjaz” would seem a suitable address for the present. His Majesty’s Government’s reiterated determination to secure inde pendence of Arab Nation will, as you suggest, show that whilst we are doubtful of political wisdom of his action it can in no way affect our support of his and of Arabs’ cause. Ends. My telegram No. 947 referred to above was misdirected to Simla instead of to Sirdar by most regrettable mistake. It has now been sent to him. “ King of Arabs in Hedjaz ” would be shortened in usage to “ King of Arabs ” a most dangerous term—as illustrated in a lesser degree in Turkey by case of title “ King of Hellenes ”, 82 Telegram P., No. 965, dated the 9th (received 10th) November 1916.

Although some of my points are answered in Foreign Office telegram 875, which crossed my telegram 627, I should still like my telegram 627, telegraphed in extenso to Foreign Office. It places facts of situation before Government read in conjunction with my tele gram 527, and is a record of my recommendations which may be useful to them should this sudden alarm turn out to be exaggerated and report of enemy advance premature. Ends. Following is repetition of his No. 627 :— Begins. My telegram of October 31st, No. 593. Please transmit following from me to Foreign Office :— Begins. Hedjaz military situation, as summarised in my telegram of October 24th, 527, to Chief, London, has been rendered more acute by reports received at Rabegh on October 31st that a Turkish Column had reached Ebn El Hassani three days* march from Rabegh and that Turks intended to advance in force south along Sultaui Road (via Rabegh and by aa inland route).TO guns complete, excepung jjtrsunnw r regards French contingent (one maciune gun of which has arrived at buez and remainder should arrive there about November 15th), Bremond maintains his inion that it should not proceed to Itabegh unless it is decided to send there an Anglo-French force of at least six battalions with two mountain batteries and four field batteries. Wilson, who is aware of decision of His Majesty’s Government not to despatch a brigade to Hedjaz, recommends that French contingent from Suez should remain at Rabegh in case an emergency necessitates a rapid evacuation, and has been iniormed by Bremond that lie has ur a ed his Government to present several batteries without personnel to Sheriff and has represented necessity for sending inlantry supports with Irench contingent if landed at Rabegh. I learn from Bremond’s report that French contingent contains a number of recruits and will probably not be fit to go inland (without its French person, nel) until about December 15th. It is suggested by Bremond that it could then be best employed as a single group under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Cadi (a Moslem officer) to stiffen Arab force on eastern road. An engineer com pany if so ordered could he states prepare field defence at Rabegh. In Colonel Farthous’s opinion Arabs are quite incapable at present of defending Rabegh, and to put it in a state of defence and reinforce Arabs there is of first importance. These measures should enable them to hold the place provided serious Turkish advance can be held off for a month or two. I thought it necessary however in view of last alarming reports to suggest desirability of naval concentration at Rabegh to Naval Commander-in-Chief for dual purpose of giving encouragement to Arabs and of (possibly) giving the Turks the impression that an expeditionary force is about to land. This assembly of ships would also be able to secure evacuation of Egyptian army No further useful action can be taken by me pending a decision by His Majesty’s Government and French Government on recommendations made in my telegram 527 and this telegram ; communication to me of their decision as soon as possible is therefore solicited.

Prom— The Sirdar, Khartoum, . , _ . , p , n To-The Secretary to the Government of India m the Foreign and Poht.eal Depart- ment, Simla. T have discussed situation since despatch of my telegram No. 527 November 2nd, with Admiral Womyss and Captain Lawrence who has just arrived from a visit to baisal. - Present military situation in Hedjaz presents two salient features. (1) If strongly attacked by Turks Eabegh position would not be tenable even with naval assistance unless— ., . (a) One brigade of regular troops with artillery at least could arrive there in time, or (5) a trained Arab force of about 5,000 men with artillery was avail- able for defence. (a) is ruled out by War Office decision that troops are not available. For (6) see under “ Arab trained band ”. (Necessity for keeping in the field most important group of Arab tribesmen {viz., those hitherto operating under Faisal.) Fact must be emphasised that during past five months this group of_ 3,000 tribesmen operating in hills on a line of Kheif-Shofia-Uhavir, with their base at Hamra and Bir Ibn Hassani, has constituted sole Arab defence against a lurkish In these circumstances I therefore propose with full concurrence of Admiral Commander-in-Chief from point of view of bis (naval) responsibility to supply the moral and material support (aeroplanes, guns, machine guns) necessary to enable tribal Army now at Kheif, &amp;c., to continue their defensive in the bills and their attempts on Hedjaz railway. Should they be successful in this, time will he given for development of action proposed under following headings:— Eabegh. —This will be the training ground for new trained bands, a naval base for Arab military forces and (British) aeroplane station. French Contingent. —This contingent will proceed direct to Babegh where its training can be completed (see my telegram No. 627). I will now convey the orders to this effect to Bremond acting on spirit of instructions in your telegram of 4th. Arab trained bands .—The necessity for a trained and organised Arab force either to garrison liabegh or to provide a stable element with armed tribesmen in the field is apparent. For trained bands a promising contingent of villegers and townsmen has been collected by Sheriff, but the rapidity with which lorce can be made efficient depends on whether a nucleus of partially trained men can be provided at once. Hence I bring request to Government of India to send such a proportion of Arab military prisoners now in India as is fit for active service as soon as possible. If, as Arab officers from confidently expect, a good percentage of these ei*prisoners will join Sherin»this will simplify the problem of trained hands. A total strength of 5.000 is aimed at. In the equipment of this force Sir A. Murray will assist as far as his resources permit, llequirements which Egypt and Soudan cannot supply must be sent from England and as soon as I have received exact information I will communicate with War Office on the subject. British Military J/issmw,—There is very urgent need for presence at Rabegh of a small expert military staff to superintend the organisation of Arab trained bands and to advise on military situation. Colonel Newcombe, an artillery officer and an Engineer Officer, should be sent as soon as possible (see recommendation 5 in my telegram No. 627, October 24th). Colonel Newcombe’s assistants should/if possible, have previous experience of Arabs. I should be glad of Your Lordship’s confirmation of above course of action as soon possible. Addressed to Foreign Office, London ; repeated to Cairo. From — His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla. Sirdar was sent following, November 6th:— Begins. According to Wilson’s telegram 471 situation at Rabegh is apparently not as critical as v as feared, but recent emergency has sufficed to prove that we must abandon principle of not allowing Christians to land in Hedjaz when essential issues are involved. Sheriff should, therefore, be informed that you have been entrusted with supervision of military assistance to the Arabs, and that Rabegh which is clearly the pivot of present situation, can be secured by presence of French and Soudanese troops and artillery, provided they are under their Christian officers and accompanied by technical personnel, and that Sheriff, if he wishes Rabegh and the road to Mecca to be protected, must, therefore, give the strictest orders for complete facilities for British and French units at Rabegh and that if there are any difficulties these units will have to be withdrawn entirely. You wall then be able to give question of defence of Rabegh unrestricted consideration. As regards French troops there I have received note from French Government which I interpret as giving you a free hand. French Government is being so informed. Ends.

This object will be met by proposals in y No. 9 of November 8th, which is concurred in. Immediate necessities appto be trained gunners for artillery, machine gunners, engineers and infantry instructors. Our reports show that much of material which is being supplied by us is being wasted owing to ignorance particularly machine guns. As regards maciune guns and mountain guns some trained Indian Mahometan personnel might possibly be provided, but support of this nature should be based on a comprehensive scheme submitted by you. It should be possible to provide Sheriff with backing he requires with resources in Mahometan personnel at our disposal, even if Soudan cannot assist, and with assistance which French have offered. Your proposal for a British Military Mission at Rabegh is approved. At present we get most contradictory reports, and it will be able to keep us more accurately informed regarding situation. Despatch of a British Brigade has not hitherto been sanctioned by War Committee, and I cannot, therefore, hold out expectation that this will be possible.

Jeddah has consulted me regarding certain applications for British proteo tion from families of Egyptian or Indian origin settled in Hedjaz, including one of an Egyptian family settled there 250 years ago. Of course Indian families who have retained their British nationality are T entitled to British protection. Our experience here however points to the wisdom of encouraging claims to exceptional treatment put us by families of foreign origin who have abandoned all intention of leaving the country. The only Egyptian claims we should press are those Egyptian merchants who can establish that they have not severed their connection with Egypt, There seems no reason for protecting other Ottomans who do not accept new regime. Semi-official intervention of Franco-British representatives in regard to treatment of foreign residents will in my opinion be useful and may be indis pensable. It should, however, clearly be understood that arrangement is provi sional and care should be taken to prevent its resulting in any international institutions or control in Hedjaz.

Enclosure No. 2. No. 278. Tbe Residency, Cairo; 22nd October 1916. My Lord, I have the honour to forward herewith a report addressed to the Arab Bureau, Cairo, by Colonel A. C. Parker, dated H. M.

The Viscount Grey of Fallodon, K.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. [Copy) Arab Bureau, Cairo. H. M. S. “ Dufferin Rahegh ; 7th October 1916. In continuance of previous reports: On the 5th October the telegram reached me at Rabegh saying that the flight of aeroplanes were being sent with an escort of 200 Irtish soldiers. I took the message immediately to Captain Boyle Senior Naval Officer and it being a naval responsibility to ensure the sate landing of troops and stores, he nroceeded to examine the possibilities. He decided to blow a boat passage in the reef up to the beach, if possible, and to erect shears to deal with the hoistin 0, of packages on to the land trom the boats oi Sambuks employed. On the afternoon of the 5th, H. M. S. “ Dufferin ” proceeded north to Abiad a peninsula near Bureika, to examine possibilities ot using it as a permanent or as an advance base. A preliminary reconnaissance had been carried out by H. M. S. “ Anne’’ accompanied by Major Bannatyne, but no satisfactory anchorage or boat landing place had been found. H. M. S. “ Dufferin ” arrived off Abiad at 8 A. M. on the 6th, and, while steam pinnaces reconnoitred for an entrance through the reefs for the ship, a party consisting of Captain Boyle, Major Bannatyne, Commander Malone and myself proceeded to the shore. The objects of the reconnaissance were to ascertain if it were possible to make it the flight headquarters in preference to Rabegh on account of its being much nearer tne present sphere of active operations, or alternatively as a temporary advanced fuel base. The failure to find an anchorage adjacent for the flight ship or for a war ship to cover position and no good boat landing places having been found, renders the place unsuitable for a permanent base. A good aeroplane landing place was found however, and it may be possible to use it as a temporary advanced fuel base if a warship brings up and lands the necessary stores and ensures protection during the period that it is in use. The military situation in the neighbourhood of Faisal Bey’s army appears to be developing. News is extraordinarily scarce, almost non-existent, and it seems impossible to get any information as to the importance and strength of the new Turkish advance on Bir Abbas. Some of Faisal’s men appear to have been engaged and he is reported to be proceeding in person to gauge the situation. I understand that, if the Turks attempt an advance on Aenbo, he will oppose them at Harnra, while if their objective is to move south down the Sultani Road he will not force them to a decisive action, but will rtmaia on their western flank and harass them and their communications. It is impossible to guess the Turkish intentions without a particle of information as to their strength or transport arrangements. I am endeavouring to inspire Ali Bey and Nuri Bey with the primary necessity of good and freshly gathered information. As I have previously reported, I have suggested that Abdulla’s army should concentrate here. If it is not required it can move north from here And join Faisal’s operations against the Turks, or move still further north.# i. riel 79 i the , I d it ores, sage i the &gt;yed. as a had , but ^hile ship, alone ire to rence ctive war- ound, nding &gt;orary i and jpears ind it gtk of ear to ge the bo, be down bmaia It is ion as imary army i here One reason against Abdulla conning to Rabegh is, I understand, that his army is composed of Beni Ateiba, while all Ali’s men are Harb, and though ^ the two tribes have officially buried the hatchet for the duration of war, there is likely to be trouble from their too close contiguity. While in such blank ignorance it is impossible to recommend or even to susT^est any other operations, but I still consider that operations carried out against Wejh and other northern coast towns are most important as giving the Turks a feeling of insecurity as to their communications. If the situation clears, I will approach the naval authorities and then endeavour to get Ali Bey or Faisal Bey to supply men for the purpose. From the last story I heard from those parts Basri Pasha was likely to proceed, or had proceeded to Wejh to keep the Arabs sympathetic to the Turks. Basri Pasha was, I am told, the Civil Governor of Medina. I think I have not mentioned in previous reports, though perhaps Colonel Wilson has reported it by wire, that Hussein of Rabegh left his place of refuge in the hills near Rabegh on about the 1st of October for Medina. He was accompanied by his brother and probably a small following of Arabs. The number of the latter is thought by Ali Bey to be few. Subsequently a per quisition was made by Ali Bey’s orders of Hussein’s property and some supplies (of those given by His Majesty’s Government) discovered as well as some rifles and ammunition. It is thought that possibly more rifles remain buried. No mails reached me by the last ship coming from Suez and I suggest that the conditions here are sufficiently arduous without such a deprivation. I shall be grateful if you will send me by the first opportunity a supply of paper in blocks similar to this together with some carbon paper and envelopes. Note .—These reached me on the 9th via Jeddah. They could have come several days sooner if directed to Rabegh. Map which was being reproduced of Sultani and Eastern Road did not come. 10th October 1916. A. C. Parker, Lt.-Col. POST CRIPT. 10th October 1916. The expected opportunity of despatching letters on the 7th proved not to exist and I continue from that date: On the 7th, H. M. S. “ Dufferin ” returned to Rabegh and I transferred to H. M. S. “ Hardinge”. In the morning, Lieutenant Perry, R. E., commenced blasting a boat channel through the reef in accordance with the wishes of Captain Boyle, R. N. On the 8th, Nuri Bey came on board and reported the capture by the Turks of Bir Abbas and the Safra defile to the south of it. In view of the apparent possibility of a Turkish advance on Rabegh he emphasized the need for the quick despatch of the C. F. Mountain Batteries previously asked for. On the 9th October, by previous arrangement with Ali Bey, two parties proceeded to the shore. One of them proceeded to the east, or right, of the Arab position in order to prove visibility from ships in the harbour of certain points on that flank, both with a view to ship’s fire and the possibilities of helio signalling for the direction of same. The objects had been previously explained, but nevertheless the obstacles offered were only removed after a somewhat lengthy personal interview of Ali fBey by Captain Boyle. The other party bad, at the same time, ridden to thea to the customary obstacles of not entpr- loft of the Arab position, an , 3^ houses, endeavoured to improve tli e in g the P, a ‘ m /^Xtch which had been previously made with the purpose „f f topography of the sKeten,w X h e examination of the spot proved less facilitating gun fire from P • brf)ken saDd hiUs running out a long way, ^erhaps tL or three miles, to the front and giving good cover to an attack- ing force from fiie tr °“^ art was put to the inconvenience of waiting i n On wishing to retur P y ^ i8sioil to cross the Wadi by a path, ‘ v'^hld twte' been pmvtusly Led, owing to the statement of the officer which had twice party another way, involving a of the escort that J 1 ® or AU Bpy was&gt; therefore, visited on the way back, detour of at least two • ~ , Dro t es t being made at the same time of and the officer reported, a landed solely with a view to assist* the difficulties put « way ot om s and was most •as ttrsuir.su’*- &gt;■ ^ 'tZI'ZZ’J L l‘&gt;'&lt; ie.l. ' Q der ccv, .1 fire of mountain and machine guns brought up for the purpose. On the 5th and 6th, the Turks again attacking, with gnus and machine guns, seised Bir Abbas and the Safra defile to the south of it. On the 7th, thev appear to have again abandoned these places after twelve V, c- fiahti ,&lt;* retiring on Bir El Raik near Bir Mas;,id, and withdrawing their 8 guns and machine guns with difficulty. The Turks are said to have lost tneir gu , •, tnm „ rifles an( i tents and to have had some men taken prisoners. The 8th passed quietly. According to the reports received none of Faisal Bey’s main body were involved in these operations which were undertaken by Beduin. Faisal Bev is reported to have sent a body of 1,500 Beduins to attack the Turks at Masid and intends to move his Egyptian Artillery and mainbody to Bir Abbas and to hold that place. Turkish prisoners are said to have given the composition of the Turkish force as the following 130th Regiment. 42nd Regiment. Mixed Regiment of Medina locals. Regiment of two Battalions Artillery. Regiment mixed Cavalry and Camel Corps. Three Aeroplanes of which one already broken and two not yet flown. There is no confirmation of the pressure of Von Kress. Information received here is scare and vague, and since it is only received at second hand, is impossible to value accurately. It is therefore extremely difficult to guage the importance of the Turkish movements. It is practically certain that the movement on Bir Abbas was not intended for a serious advance and it seems likely that it may have been meant to draw the Arabs into a position in which they can be engaged to advantage. The Arab leaders at Rabegh appear to be too much elated(?) by the last report they receive. At the present moment the Turks having retreated it is not thought that they intend to make a serious advance. The first part of Abdulla Bey’s force is due to reach Rabegh on the 14th or 16th. The destruction of part of the railway line by Sheikh Asaaf has already been reported in detail by telegram. It is most important to encourage the Arabs to‘recognize the importance, as well as the feasibility of such action. As regards the Northern Hedjaz coast towns the latest news (received 10th October) is to the effect that there is a force of from 400-600 Turks with 1^00 Arabs at Wejh and Sharm Habban. The importance which the Turks attacnto these places can be readily understood and the corresponding advantage of transporting a sufficiently large force of Arabs by sea and landing them provided the situation is ensured in the south, ie obvious. Aeroplanes. —My opinions as to the employment of aeroplanes have not changed. So long as the Turks remain north of Bir Abbas little can be done even using an advanced fuel depot. Moreover the Abaid site, as already reported, has considerable drawbacks from lack of a good boat landing or(?) anchorage. The use of an advanced fuel depot inland is apparently out of the question from the great difficulties which would be met with from the Arabs themselves, as the obstacles placed in the way of making a sketch at Rabegh has shown. The chief argument however appears to me to be that it seems wrong to give any assistance in land operations which involve the landing of a single British soldier unless the plan of operations appear to assure success; and personally I cannot imagine that it is likely that Arabs in entrenchments, to which their mode of fighting in no way fits them, could resist a determined Turkish attack. If, therefore, the Turks remain where they are, aeroplanes can do practically nothing to aid the Arabs, whereas, if the Turks advance, aeroplanes in no way ensure their defeat, while their employment by them selves involves us in unsatisfactoy land operations. If it is proposed to participate, let us refuse to do so except in such a way as will ensure success. Should a serious Turkish advance on Rabegh prove imminent, a Brigade landed at Rabegh would ensure it against capture. It would moreover release a large number of Arabs who could be transported to the northern Hedjaz for employment against the coast towns and possibly latter against the railway. Even if a Turkish advance south does not appear likely to materialize, the plan has strong arguments in its favour since it enables the Arabs to take action where it is most feared by the Turks. The result might well be the immediate strengthening of the Arab cause by the bringing in of Arab waverers and allow the early withdrawal of the British force. Nor does it appear likely to involve us in indefinite operations, since the Arabs would no doubt be warned that in no case would the force move out of Rabegh, nor would they w ish us to do so. An obstacle to the plan is possibly the Arabs themselves and it should not be undertaken unless they are completely in agreement and fully comprehend the object in view. A. C. Pabker. Enclosure No. 5. No. 280. The Residency, Cairo; 26th October 1916. My Lord, I have the honour to forward herewith copy of a despatch (No. 8) with various enclosures, which I received from Colonel Wilson at Jeddah, dealing with the general situation. I am sending a copy of this despatch to India. I have the honour to be, My Lord, with the highest respect, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servant, A. H. McMahon. The Viscount Grey of Fallodon, K.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.(Secret.) Jeddah. Despatch No. SlF ’ I hare the iurooxir to forward the following report for Tour Excellency’, information. Pilorimaqe .—I am informed by Hussein Effecdi Rnhi that all the pil- grinifare rerr pleased wi th the arrangements made and the manner m which they are looked after and treated. _ It is reported that there is no sickness among the pilgrims. Trench Jf.mon—Colonel Bremond informed me recently that a large building had been bought in Mecca by the French Government which would be used”for housing the French pilgrims in future years. The relations between Colonel Bremond and myself are all that I could desire He is most anxious to ingratiate himself with the authorities here, hence his ordering the cholera and plague serum by telegraph which I under- stand somewhat annoved the Sheriff; he recently informed me that he proposed telegraphing for a French Engineer and Assistant, also the necessary fumls to gjL the old condenser into working order and run it. I informed him that I had already consulted the Sheritf on the subject and that for tuts season the one condenser was considered sufficient; he at once agreed to leave the matter alone. With reference to Tour Excellency’s telegram No. 1619 of 9th October re French assistance to he given the Sheriff, I attach a copy ot the telephone note I sent the Sheriff, who. the same morning, sent me a reply to the following effect by telephone. He expressed his entire agreement with the advice given bv Your Excellency and said he had told the Head of the Mission (Ruhi was present) that when he was in need of any help he would ask for some guns, but would not ask for anything at present, he also expressed his warm thanks for the offer. The Sheriff went on to tell me that be always preferred to ask the British and not the French Government for all his requirements and that he himself never wanted the French Mission to come but since France was our Ally, he had done all he could in their honour at my request, but would much prefer that no one helped him except the British Government. This coversa- tion took place before the Sheriff was informed by the Mission that French troops had left Algiers and were on their way. Hussein Buhi informs me that Ahmed Rida is very friendly with the French Aiission and that he has an Agent who sleeps outside the Mission tent who heard Rida tell the t rench that everybody in Egypt loathes the British and how overjoyed the Syrians were at the French joining the Arab Move ment as their friend, &amp;c. P„uhi also reports that Rida has been secretly distributing pamphlets in Mecca which are said to be very fanatical and calculated to inffame Moslems against Christians ; that he is working against the British influence and the Sneriff is very annoyed at his presence. I have instructed Ruhi to obtain a copy of the pamphlet, if possible. Jeddah Toicn .—Major Thomson, D.S.O., R.A.M.C., is going thoroughly into the questions of Quarantine and Sanitary matters and his advice will be very valuable to me. There is a world of intrigue going on in the town and both Masaud Effendi, the Director of Pulic Security, and Doctor Malouf, have told me privately that they do not think they can carry on much longer under existing conditions with Sheriff Mohsen Ibn Mansur at the head of affairs. I get on very well with the latter and like him, but he is an entirely unsuitable person * to be Governor of Jeddah and impossible as such after the war. He has, I understand, absolute influence over the Harb tribe, and it would not be easy or indeed advisable for the Sheriff to remove him at present. One matter on which I may come to loggerheads with him over and which is a very delicate one is the subjects of the slaves. Slaves are, I havepood reason to think, being sold in Jeddah frequently and one or two Takruris have already taken refuge in my house. The line I propose to follow is that, it' I feel fairly sure from the slave’s story, that he was kidnapped in the Soudan during the last two years or so, I do not propose to give hirn or her up; even this will almost certainly lead to trouble with Sheriff Mohsen and I should be glad to know if the above proposal meets with Your Excellency’s approval. This is always a very difficult question, and I am convinced that, if I took in every slave who ran aivay to my house, I should be inundated with slaves from all parts of the country. Staff .—In view of the French Military Mission being here and likely to remain indefinitely, I strongly recommend that both Mr. Young and Mr. Cochrane be granted the temporary rank and commission of Captain in the Army. I do not make this recommendation with the idea of turning the “Pilgrims Officer’s Mission *’into a military one, but Ido consider the present situation somewhat unsatisfactory and the granting of Commissions to these two gentlemen would, in my opinion, tend to greatly improve matters. The two Indian officers returned from Mecca to-day and are immensely pleased with the treatment they received at the hands of the Sheriff and with everything in general. They have brought a lot of very useful inform ation which Captain Bray will obtain and present a report on his arrival in Cairo. As I have had no reply to my request to retain Captain Bray’s services and as H.M.S. “ Dufferin ’’ leaves to-morrow, I have, much to my regret, to send him back with the two officers to Egypt, but I very much hope that it will be possible for Your Excellency to arrange for him to return here where he would be of the greatest possible use to me, as an Intelligence Officer, and numerous other ways; I would be extremely grateful if Your Excellency would assist me in this matter. I also trust that the Cipher Officer, for whom Mr. Storrs was to ask Your Excellency, will be sent; as I have explained to the Director of the Arab Bureau, I have really not got the time I should have to give to important matters and everything is being done at high pressure, and many things get overlooked. Mr. Cochrane is proceeding to Egypt for a much needed change of air and will be absent about a fortnight and I am thus left w r ith only Mr. Young who may also have to go away for a change on Mr. Cochrane’s return; the work has been continuous and strenuous and the climate extremely trying until the middle of last month ; I have much pleasure in bringing to Your Excellency’s notice the excellent work of these two gentlemen. Ex.-Egyptian Officers .—With reference to Your Excellency’s telegram No. 1619 in which you state that Ex-Egyptian Officers selected by Faruki have been refused by the Sheriff and therefore the impression is given that the Sheriff is adequately provided for in the matter of trained Instructors, I had a talk with Sheriff on the subject and what he objects to and on no account will accept, are officers or anyone else selected by Faruki, but he would warmly welcome any Egyptian Officer recommended by the Sirdar; if there are any still desirous of volunteering, I would suggest that their names be sent to the Sirdar who knows exactly the type of officer who would be suitable for the work. Rabegh .—I attach a copy of a note I addressed to the Sheriff by telephone which was taken down by Hussein B,uhi which explains itself. 1 hope that now there will be no more trouble which I am inclined to think arises from the fact which is known that the Turks have offered a reward for every British Officer killed. Turkish prisoners .—The following is the present number given for passage in H. M.

Telephone message for Sheriff through Ruhi Effendi, dated the 11th October 1916. On 6th October Abdulla Bey told me that the French Mission bad informed him that French Moslem troops could be sent if required and that Sheriff wanted to know if His Majesty’s Government approved of his accept ing such help. Wilson Pasha to Sheriff. Tell Sheriff that His Excellency the High Commissioner considers that after thankirg French Government for their offer he should ask them for the mountain batteries and at the same time inform the French Government that he has the necessarv officers and men to work them and that he would therefore like the batteries sent complete without personnel as soon as possible. If the French do not like sending the battaries without versonnel. Sheriff should ask for them to be sent with very little number of men. The Sheriff should lay stress on the impossibility of i: rench Christian officers proceeding inland. As Sheriff has refused to take several retired Egyptian officers who volun teered to serve through Faruki, His Excellency the High Commissioner presumes that Sheriff does not want any more instructors but if instructors for machine cun sections or the company of engineers offered by the French are really required by the Sheriff, the* High Commissioner does not wish to advise him not to have them if they are necessary for the Sheriff’s success. 12th October 1916. Telephone message to Sheriff through Ruhi. After salaams, fyc .—The captain of the ‘*Fox” arrived last night and tells me that there is still a lot of trouble about British officers going over the oround in the neighbourhood of Rabegh. I wrote to Your Highness on 1st October on this subject, and Your Highness said you were sending orders to Aii Bey that British officers were to be allowed to go where they wished for purposes of arranging about the defence. Now I must make it quite clear to Y'our Highness that such orders must he sent to Ali Bey which ^ill prevent any trouble in future.It is absolutely necessary for these officers to go over the ground and if they are not allowed to do so, how can I ask for British troops to be landed if requested by Ali Bey. It is impossible. I must therefore ask Your Highness to make it quite clear to Ali Bey that Colonel Parker and the officers must land when they like and that a guard should be sent with them. Colonel Parker was Governor of Sinai and is an officer of great experience with Arabs. Your Highness in a telephone message yesterday asked that the officers should not go further than the places Ali Bey fixed for them. Colonel Parker must ride to the front of the defences in order to see the ground and if Your Highness does not wish, I must decline any responsibility. We are trying to help the Arab cause and I cannot understand the reason of all this bother between friends. What is it ? I regret bothering Your Highness when you are so busy, but this matter must be settled once and for all. Wilson Pasha. Note.-*- Abdulla Bey who read the above as it was being taken down by Ruhi replied that he entirely agreed with all I said and after seeing Sheriff he informed me(?) that Sheriff had instructed him to send orders to Ali Bey that he must provide proper guards for Colonel Parker and that they can go anywhere within gunfire range beyond the Arab position. C. E. W. Copy of telegram. The Sheriff of Mecca to Wilson Pasha. 11th October 1916, I thank you for your good news about the victories of Paisal, which I have no doubt is told with all sincerity. I now beg to inform Your Excellency that the repeated attacks of the enemy indicate that he wishes to advance on any given opportunity. Therefore all care should be taken so as to advance towards Medina from the three directions and as was explained in a telephone message yesterday so we beg to ask from Great Britain that sufficient trained and disciplined troops be brought to land at Rabegh before a moment is lost. In this way all arrangements will be facilitated and the advance of the enemv will be stopped. The advance to Medina depends upon the fulfilment of this request and the sooner it is fulfilled the quicker Medina will be captured. But if this is delayed even for a moment, arrangements for attacking Medina will be held up as Faisal is going from Geheina, Abdulla from the east and north of Medina and Ali from the centre. Abdulla w ill play the most important part in the siege by stopping the supplies sent from Ibn Rashid as well as those coming from Sakin and Nejd to Medina for the Turks. I have no doubt that Great Britain and her able men will not neglect our request which is of great importance and necessity. I therefore beg you to transmit this telegram to the High Commissioner by wireless. Dated the llth October 1916. With greatest respects, Hussein, Sheriff and Emir of Mecca.(Secret.) Reference Aden 32nd weekly letter. Sheriff informs me that he received some time ago letters from both tj lft Imam and his lieutenant el Mikdad and knew that fighting was to take p[ aee between them. He also thinks that the Imam will not stick to his treaty with the Turks. The Sheikh of Lahej the Sheriff also told me sent him a letter recently to say that he was under the Sheriff’s orders. Uth October 1916. C. E. W. Enclosure No. 4. No. 281. The Residency, Cairo; 25th October 1916. My Lord, In continuation of my telegram No. 889 of October 13th, I have the honour to forward herewith a report, which I have received from Colonel Wilson at Jeddah, on the general military situation in the Hedjaz. I have the honour to be, My Lord, with the highest respect, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servant, A. H. McMahon. P. S.—l am also sending a copy of this despatch to the Viceroy of India. J The Viscount Grey of Eallodon, K. G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Jeddah, 13th October 1916. Military situation, fyc. I attach herewith a translation of the cipher message referred to in nr telegram No. 304 of to-day. &amp; ' It is unnecessary for me to dilate on the difficulty of getting the Sheriff t s ic o one proposal, he is constantly changing his ideas, requests and every ceivab^subjVct 11 ^ W1 ^ 1 re ° ar&lt; ^ military operations but on every con ^ aS ^ ec ^ ^ or i mme diate despatch of troops t&lt; tnrnfvt ^ J cn a Wlt ^ ^ Sherif, I considered it a good oppor tunity to get the Sheriff tied down, if possible, to certain concrete requests anc get the situation from his point of view cleard up. 4 nreserf/ an^th^ p 0T1 “^dulla lasted over two hours, the Sheriff was present and the conversation was carried on chiefly through Hussein itulii though at intervals Abdulla took the receiver. 7 g that the^Eritkh tr ^ ^ ie Sheriff in his cipher telegram meanl eplied “ Ye ’’ ^ S l nt t0 Rab ^ h once, to which Abduih andseal Jotn; ^ C ^ e the Sheriff should at once writs would read to melnT , Ti Bn - ti f h tr00 P s to be which Ruhi Effendi d o me and send by special messenger. Abdulla replied that hewould ask his father and I begged him to ask the Sheriff to make up his mind once for all as his decision must he final, it being impossible for him to change his requests every day. After an interval Abdulla said that he had consulted the Sheriff and wished to sav that the urgency for trained troops to be at Rabegb arose from the plan of operations they had made, viz., that Abdulla Bey was to advance alon^ the Eastern Pilgrim road and threaten Medina from that side, Ah Bey was to go up the line of the Sultani Road while Faisal Bey attacked from the fcorth-West. The question of safeguarding Rabegh thus arises and the trained troops are asked for to occupy the place and free Ali Bey’s force. The Sheriff asked for Egyptian troops to he sent at once. I replied that I could hold out no hope that any were available. Abdulla Bey then asked whether Moslem Troops could not be brought from East Africa being replaced by British troops from France. I informed him that even if possible the length of time involved made the proposal valueless; he next said that Indian Moslem troops could be brought from Bombay in 12 days and why could not they be brought ? I replied that a large number cf Indian troops were in Mesopotamia and that even if other troops from India were available, which I doubted, it would probably be nearer a month than 12 days before they could arrive. Abdulla went on to say that both he and the Sheriff were most anxious to know whether a British force was under orders to leave Suez at once if required as he had previously requested, and they asked me to give them an assurance that a British force, considered adequate to successfully defend Rabegh, would arrive at Rabegh in four days from the day such a force was asked°for by Ali Bey, and guarantee the safety of Rabegh. I ^ replied that I was unable to give such assurance or guarantee but, at Sheriff’s request, told him that I would telegraph to Your Excellency (my dOI of 13th October). Abdulla Bey next said that he could not learn from the French Mission the strengh of the Infantrv included in the force from Algiers (mentioned in mv telegram 302 of 12th October) but if the British authorities considered It, was strong enough to hold Rabegh against a Turkish attack then the Sheriff would like it sent in preference to the British force so as to avoid the religious question. I asked whether, in the event of French force being sent to Rabegh, it would take part in the operations against Medina: Abdulla replied “No”, certainly not ”, that they would be used purely for garrison purposes at Rabegh until the fall of Medina when it would be sent back to Suez. Abdulla asked me whether I personally would be pleased if the French force came, and would I not prefer that a British torce were sent. I replied that all I was concerned with was that the Sheriff’s forces should defeat the Turks and capture Medina, that if the Sheriff considered military assistance in the shape of troops was absolutely necessary it was a matter for the Sheriff to decide what troops were asked for. Abdulla then asked why was Great Britain fighting for and helping Belgium and France; was it not because they were Allies ? The Arabs are now also allies of Great Britain and therefore she must fight for them as well and every effort should be made to send British Moslem troops to assist. I replied that as he and the Sheriff knew Great Britain had given a very great amount of assistance to the Sheriff already and would continue to give ail assistance possible. This Abdulla, on behalf of the Sheriff, warmly acknowledged, and after the usual compliments the conversation terminated. It is extraordinarily difficult, in fact, practically impossible, to correctly guage the existing military situation at any given date. At the moment Faisal Bey appears to have met with some success and is pushing the Turks opposed to him back along the Sultani road. I think it probable that the enemy force is either a reconnaissance force or is sent with the intention of drawing Faisal or with the hope of being able to suddenly attack him with greatly superior forces and inflict a crushing defeat.88 I personally do not consider that Faisal will allow himself to he caugl.t i„ n n nihor hand, if such a French force is not available I recommend Turkish advance that led me to surest that the .Brigade oe sent 10 ron Sudan and await developments (my telegram No. V79, dated October 10th). It inust be, I know, most inconvenient for a Brigade with the necessary transports to be kept waiting, but short of sending the Biigade to Rabegh now, which should not be done unless absolutly necessary, I see no other way in which it can be certain of arriving at Rabegh, if required, before the lurks. In my telegram No. 304 of to-day I asked whether a definite decision could be given by the 16th instant as to whether His Majesty’s Government was prepared to guarantee the safety of Rabegh in event of a severe advance of the Turks on that place or not. Such a guarantee would go a long way to ease the situation here if I could inform Skerilf of it. Such a guarantee would not necessarily mean that British troops would be landed, but knowing that Rabegh would be held by trained troops in the event of a serious enemy advance on it, Ali Bey, as at present arranged would advance. The result of the offensive by the three brothers could then be w atched, if successful all need for British troops vanishes, if unsuccessful a British Brigade at Port Sudan could come across in about 24 hours. Unless some such guarantee is given or Rabegh occupied by trained Moslem troops I am informed that Ali Bey could not advance. The Taif artillery under Said Basha Ali are expected here to-morrow and proceed direct to Rabegh on H. M. S. “ Hardinge.” I was informed to-day by theS. N. O., Red Sea Patrol, that a Turkish force is at Wedj, strength 2,000, with guns and Maxims, about 500 of the force are Turks the remainder Arabs. Busri Pasha said to be in command and (Kaimakam ?) Mohammed Beshir who was Commandant at Yanboiswith the force and that they are expected to advance against Um Lej. A force is leaving Mecca to-day to reinforce the Garrison at Kunfida and the Sheriff expresses the opinion that the force being sent will be sufficient to tackle the Turks in the neighbourhood. From a merchant who recently arrived from Medina I learnt that food is very scarce indeed there, that the Turks have arrested 25 pro-Sheriff Sheikhs and sent them to Damascus and that there are German officers with the troops. Of other information of value he expressed ignorance. I doubt the presence of Germans at Medina. With reference to my despatch No. 225 of September 16th and previous correspondence, I have the honour to transmit herewith to Your Lordship 13th October 1916. C. Wilson, Lieutenant- Colonel. No. 282. The Residency, Cairo ; 25th October 1916* My Lord, Enclosube No. 5.cnpv of a report which I have received from the Military Intelligence Depart ment on the subject of the visit of the two Indian officers to the Grand Sheriff of Mecca. I am also sending a copy to the Viceroy of India. I have the honour to be, with the highest respect, My Lord, Tour Lordship's most obedient, humble servant, A. H. McMahon. The Viscount Grey of Fallodon, K. G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. Dated Cairo, the 19th October 1916 (Secret). From— Captain N. N. S. Bray, 18th K. G. O. Lancers, To—The Director of Military Intelligence, War Office. I have the honour to submit herewith a report on the visit of Risaldar- Major Gul Nawas Khan, 18th (K. G. O.) Lancers, and liisaldar Mir Alam Khan, 34th Poona Horse, to the Sheriff of Mecca. The objects of the visit were (a) for these two Indian officers to study the true state of affairs in Arabia and to form their own unbiased opinions as M ussalmans as to the justice of the Arab cause ; (ft) by meeting the Sheriff, his sons and ministers to bring the ideas and ideals of the Indian Mohammedan into touch with the thoughts and aspirations of the Arabs; (c) to perform and report on the pilgrimage under the new regime and to carry that report back with them to India and finally as a result of all these objects to be able to educate public opinion in India, as far as their influence lies, to recognise the new regime in Arabia with sympathy and by explaining the truth of recent events to discountenance the agitator and calm the fears and doubts of the ignorant peasant and the religious susceptibilities of the mere educated. I hope that this report will show that the first three objects have been successfully achieved and encourage the hope that the ultimate and more important object will be attained. I would like here to place on record my thanks to the two Indian officers for their loyalty and help and their earnest efforts to help in this matter. I propose, therefore, to divide this report into the following divisions :— {a) A short history of the pilgrimage itself. (ft) Conversations with the Sheriff, Abdulla, and Rashid Ridda. (c) Public opinion and ideas in Mecca. {d) Impressions on the visit. (e) Possible results that might accrue from it. The whole of the following is a translation from Risaldar-Major Gul Nawaz Khan* s diary : A short history of the pilgrimage to Mecca, September-October 1916. We arrived at Jeadah on the 25th September 1916 and Musad Bey, (censor at Jeddah), came to assist us. The Sheriff had asked us to leave for Mecca on the evening of the 26th. We accordingly did so, riding on donkeys and unaccompanied. After we had gone about eleven miles we reached a post on the road and were examined by the guard who said that as we had no guard with us, the road dangerous and it is being night we must remain there till the following morning. I told him we had to get on as the Sheriff was expecting us the next day. ^The commander of the post replied that he had strict orders to let no one proceed who was not properly protected. We, therefore, remained the rest of the night there and went on again in the morning. When we reached Bhera (half wav between Jeddah and Mecca) we sent a telegram to the Sheriff to let him know that we had been delayed. He sent a reply to90 i tn hft Drovided and for ns to be broug^bt on Bbera ordering two ^ ^ reached Mecca on the evening of the go as to reach Mecca t a. gh.

He however, sent down special instructions and all the baggage arrived safely. As I said before one man was placed in charge group of pilgrims to act as ffuide and generally to look after them. Each pilgrim paid him Rs. 10 of^wliich Us. 2 was for water and Rs. 8 for his services. Pood cost them 110 annas a day. As far as possible the prices on foodstuffs were controlled.

Transport arrangements were very good, though I do not know about the return journey as we left before the others. Water comes underground via Arafat and is of good quality. Three davs previous to the visit to Arafat it was reduced in order to collect it there. It was sold along the road at 11-anna a glass and for 1 anna a small skin at Arafat. Medical.—I visited the hospital which is in a large building in very good order in charge of two qualified doctors and ward orderlies, ihere weie 10 patients, mostly fever cases, a few cuts, etc., and no wounded. This hospital is called Cabin Khana. In addition there are two dispensaries with European medicines. There was a doctor in charge of medical arrangements at Arafat; as far as I know there was no epidemic whatsoever among the pilgrims. Police. —A police force has been formed consisting of one Inspector paid £10 a month, one Sub-Inspector £5 a month, 1 sergeant paid £4 a month, 40 men paid £2-10-1 a month. They wear a uniform consisting of blue kurta, blue waistcoat, and red “ Aqal ’\ The name of the Inspector is Ibrahim Ramli. Wheat Rice Poodetuffs.

All were housed either with friends, inhabitants or special hostels. No pilgrims were allowed to sleep in the mosque at night. All charges were far less than formerly and were fixed by the Sheriff; any guide complained of by the pilgrims in this respect and brought to the Sheriff was severely dealt with. The Indian merchants at Mecca were discontented with the Sheriff because prices were controlled, the pilgrimage a small one and the Turks had been good customers. Chief of the discontented ones were :— Abdulla Saidulla, Abu Jeban, Mohammad Said. The Sheriff in this respect is understood to be about to ask for a reliable Indian to influence these men in his favour. Abdulla Pasha has been placed over the Beduin element and he is the very man for the post. They fear him greatly and at the same time he is not too harsh. He keeps them in splendid order. The pilgrimage to Arafat .—The pilgrimage to Arafat started from Mecca on the 6th October. Some went on foot, some on donkeys and camels. The distance is about 10 or 12 miles ; the road winds among mountains. The first place reached is Mina about four miles from Mecca. A bazaar was erected for the pilgrimage and it is here that the sacrifice is made of goats and camels, on the return from Arafat. It is here also that there are three devils represented by a wall at which the pilgrims throw stones. The next place is Mazalfa, four miles further on. Here also a bazaar was erected and water supplied; no houses, simply tents. There were no guards and no need of any. The pilgrims had no guards, there was only a guard with the Mahmal. The Sheriff left Mecca in the evening escorted by his new guard of 300 men, his guests and hundreds of Beduin on camels and on foot. There was any amount of water sold along the road for a small sum. The order is to be at Arafat before daybreak. The pilgrims were under canvas. They were large tents covered with paintings, &amp;c., and cost for lodging Rs. 10 about 10 or 12 a tent. There are no proper houses but a very large number of shops had been erected for the supply of necessaries. Food was fairly cheap. They all said food cost far less than on former pilgrimages. I r92 a priest Muzalfa stay the There were postal and telegraph arrangements. We remained till the evening. P ilgrims have to arrive WcS combined andread as one.

There was absolutely no trouble to anyone over the whole OTOceedings which worked quite simply and well. There was no confusion at air Sheep for the sacrifice 15, goat 10 rupees. In order to prevent a lot of meat lying about, the surplus not required for food was burned Having heard prayers in Mecca, changed their raiment, the pilgrims returned o Mina. We returned to Mecca for the ten prayers. There was no trouble at all, police were unnecessary, the crowds were always orderly, the rich and poor went alike in an orderly manner to pray. I do not know what happened in passed years, but this pilgrimage was a great success. General. French Mission.—The French Mission was received in great state being met outside the city by the Sheriff accompanied by a strong escort. They are staying with Ahmad Banamaji, the richest man in Mecca, and have a guard of honour on their premises. They had several audiences with the Sheriff and were in his camp at Arafat and travelled there with him. Nearly everyone in Mecca spoke of the T^nglish with great favour, fully acknowledging the help they had given. There was a rumour that 3,000 French had landed at Rabegh and that 9,000 were on their way, this was spoken of in quite a natural way and they spoke as if they wanted the British to land. Egyptians. —Several men from Egypt whose names I have forgotten were speaking against the British and bolstering up the French. I would advise the Government to watch who they send. Rashid Bey Rashid Bey Shami, editor, came to me two or three times and tried to find out what territories the Sheriff would have after the war. I told him I was on a pilgrimage and knew nothing about these matters. The poor .—I was greatly struck with the large numbers of poor in the city. The Sheriff distributes 7,000 loaves of bread (Beduin loaves) and £ 10 in cash daily to the poor. Indian pilgrims. —The chief reasons for feelings against the Sheriff were firstly that though Mohammadans were fighting for Great Britain now Moham- madans were fighting Mohammadans, and that the Sheriff had placed his affairs under control of the Christians who would seize his country. Visits to the Sheriff. 1st October 1916. Sheikh Salieh (Q. V.) took us and introduced us to the Sheriff who received us in his private rooms and gave us a most cordial welcome. Be lives in a beautiful house and is well guarded. After exchanging the usual salutations and compliments we congratulated him on his successes. Be thanked us very warmly ; we then delivered the letter of introduction given us by His Excellency the High Commissioner. We then told him we had had the pleasure of meeting his sons AJi Bey, FaisalBey and Zeid. He was delighted especially about Ali Bey, expressed the warmest affection for him and said “ He is my favourite son ’* (nasih). He then talked about Medina and added that the tribes of Medina and the Northern Najab had given an undertaking to join him if he took the city. He complained about not receiving more ammuniton and the mountain batteries from the British and said he had repeatedly asked for them. He went on to say “ My men do not understand guns and machine guns and if only the British Government would send us instructors they would soon learn *\ I replied : “ The British Government is doing its level best to assist you and a large number of rifles and machine guns were landed at Yenbo and ftabegh from the ship on which we were *\ He replied : “ Yes, that is so, but there is not enough ammunition. I can only plan, but the High God will carry out those plans. ” Note. —To my own personal knowledge (Captain Bray) I think the Sheriff had been misinformed. For the two machine guns landed at Yenbo 120,000 rounds of ammunition were landed and the ammunition for the remaining guns landed at Rabegh was in like proportion. Besides this, a very large quantity of rifle ammunition was landed both at Yenbo and Rabegh. He continued : “ I firmly believe that if I can get the supplies I ask for I can occupy Syria ”. I said I hoped he would soon be able to send a strong force to Medina. He replied : “ It is my intention to do so, and when Abdulla moves up the Eastern Road we will be able to attack Medina from three sides ”. I here made mention of Aziz Bey Misri’s name: the Sheriff put his finger between his teeth and shook his head with disapproval and gave us a sign by placing bis finger on his lips not to speak before him. After this we took our leave. He expressed the hope that Abdulla would arrive the next day and asked especially about our comfort. October 2vd. —We paid a short formal visit to give him the presents we had brought. He was very delighted and said one of them would have been sufficient. While we were there he received a letter from Faisal asking for more ammunition. We then took our leave. Note. —The Sheriff gave the gold watch to Abdulla. October 4th. —We visited him again. He asked especially after our comfort and expressed regret that the pilgrimage was a small one. I replied : “Many Mohammadans are fighting all over the world, their affairs have to be looked after by those relations not fighting, on account of the fighting many are nervous to make the venture but after the war 1 hope you will have the large numbers you are used to ”. He said : “ I have the intention of asking the authorities of outside countries not to nllow pilgrims to come totally un provided with money or any means of subsistence, they give endless trouble both to us and the other pilgrims. It is also written in the Koran that the Haj is only compulsory for those that can afford it, the poor are excused. ” “ I will also try to get the religious teachers to explain this.** I replied that if he gave me permission I would myself bring this point to notice. I also congratulated him on the excellent arrangements he had made for the pilgrims and their comfort. He replied : “ we have only just taken it in hand and I have every hope that we will improve on the arrangements in the future, I would be grateful for any suggestions.* * Here we took our leave. October 8th. —We visited him again. I asked him if he would give us a letter for Indian Mohammedans, and continued :— “ Your Excellency knows very well that every Mohammedan according to the teaching of his religion and the dictates of God bears the deepest reverence towards the Haj. I am extremaly grateful that through the kind ness of my Government 1 have had this opportunity of coming. .Next to my own gratification at coming I have this most earnest desire, namely, that Your Excellency’s present independent position may be recognised by Indian94 MuhammedaDS. Tour Excellency knows very well .hat in every place the enemy has its spies and that there are always evilly disposed persons ready to 3 the minds of the ignorant and those who act through tgnorance of the Ce facts. Mv hope is that I may carry back with me to India the truth and the real position of affairs. Having seen things for myself and received a letter from Your Excellency concemins your reasons for taking action against the Turks acting solely on your own initiative, I may explain it to mv comrades in India In order that the Muhammedans of India may recognise you as their spiritual head and realize your motives. For although certain newspapers have published the truth about these affairs those in opposition make out that these facts have been connected by ^' + if Vonr P.ypaIIpth'v agrees I would ask for a letter exnlain. ing these things? The Skerif replied : “ Only a short while ago I had printed and sent out a proclamation setting forth our objects, aims and reasons for our break with Turkey. There is no necessity for a further explanation since the position ig clearly put forward in the one I refer to. I will give you a copy (which he did Inter). There are bound to be thousands in the world in disagreement with our policy, as indeed there were before these events took place, but take this message back with you. I am trying selflessly to serve the interests of Muhammadanism ; had I indeed to benefit myself I had far better opportuni ties under the old regime (see note), but I have broken away purely for the good of Islam. Note .—The Sheriff had great inducements made him by the Turks includ ing a very large money bribe to remain loyal to them. The Sheriff was extremely pleased with what I had said to him and said: “ May God prosper you in your intentions. ” October 11th.—On hearing of Faisal’s success at Bir Abbas we again visited him to congratulate him. I did so and wished him further successes. He replied 4 ‘ Please God we will certainly win. ” I told him we were leaving the next day and if I could assist his cause in any way I hoped he would let me know. At first he did not wish to let us go and made great efforts to detain ub at any rate for a few days but when 1 explained the necessity for our leaving he very reluctantly agreed to our going. He said there were one or two points he would like to bring to the notice of the British Government. He said :— “ With the greatest sincerity and belief I say that next to Islam I respect and revere the British and for the following reasons :— Firstly .—They are tolerant and sympathetic to our religion. Secondly.—They are a nation that governs wisely and its citizens obey and respect its laws with contentment. Ihirdly .—The most important reason of all: without anv ulterior motives Great Britain has come to our assistance and our belief and trust in her is the greater because w r e know that no other motive underlies her action. Fourthly. I have read history and I also know myself that Great Britain - has always been the protector of Mohammedan interests as for instance in the Crimean war as opposed to this what has Germany done. And do vou not know what Bismark said as regards to Islam. Also Germany has taken four kilometres on either side of the Baghdad railway, a total making a country m itself, and forced the Turks to pay £1 a kilometre as a guarantee. Many faise rumours are going about Egypt and other countries, Mohammedans are those in whose hands are trust and confidence I as a Mohammedan will guard Islam and with the help of God I will continue to . protect its interests. f inn Butish Government that he is a friend who promises and .ulhils that promise. 1 am a friend of the British Government what promises—~ '4 - the ly to f the \ x ruth lived •tion it to may bhese d by lain- out with )n is h he with this ts of tuni- • the clud- said: again id we dif I in us iving aotice spect obey tenor ist in s her ritain ce in &gt; you taken ing a tee. a tries, as a U0 tO i and imises 95 I have made and what I hare undertaken, I and my sons will with God’s help keen to the letter and while life is in us. A gentleman (Sheriff) has one word and*that word he will keep. And I hope that the British Government will according to its past history keep faith to the letter and keep inviolate the bonds between us in order that no evilly disposed persons will have an excuse to bow discord, between us.” 12th October ,—We went to say good-bye. The Sheriff said “ I am delighted you came and I hope you will come again, if ever any friend or relation of yours comes be sure to let me know. I have had no chance through press of work of entertaining you as I would have wished. “Give my respects to His Excellency the High Commissioner and to Wilson Pasha.” Note. The Sheriff sent a present of £30 to the Indian orderlies. But Risaldar-Major Gul Nawaz Khan explained that it was not customary and tactfully gave it back. The Sheriff, however, gave both Indian officeri prayer carpets, large pieces of the Kiswa and various other small gifts. Visits to Abdulla. On October the 9th we visited Abdulla. News had just come in from Medina about the successful action of Eaisal's against the Turks at Bir Abbas. He told us all about it and also about the destruction of the railway north of Medina. I said to him: “ I have a recommendation to make which if it meets with your approval I hope you will mention to the Sheriff. The various pilgrims who have come here from different countries have no knowledge of the real events which led to the present situation. Before they leave I suggestthat you should call them together in‘Durbar ’ and explain to them the facts you consider it useful and necessary to carry away with them, for although they are poor and uneducated and ignorant yet when they return countless people will ask them about their experiences. Eirst they will be extremely pleased at meeting the Sheriff and secondly they will learn the true facts. I have an Urdu translation of your proclamation and personally through my visit I have been able to understand the facts brought out in that proclamation ; I have seen for myself the state of affairs and understand fully your aims and objects and your motives for taking the action you have so I will be able to exemplify and explain it. ” Abdulla was very pleased with the idea saying it was a fortunate chance I had brought it up and that he would do his utmost to have it carried out. Hole. The Sheriff said it was sufficient to have the proclamation and have the people collected and the thing gone into for them. After a time Abdulla said “ Previous to these events we had an alliance (Mohabat) with the Turks not because they were Turks but because they were Mohammedans, and as the Turkish Government has ceased to uphold Mohammedanism and broken away from their faith so we have broken with them The Koran is written and its dictates are in Arabic therefore we as Arabs are better able to guage its true meanings. I hope therefore that other Mohammedans of the world w ill be pleased and coutent that the religious affairs of Islam are in the hands of the true and noble race of Arabs (in whose language the book they revere is written and in whose country the Sacred Places of Mohammet are). I replied : “ Certainly they deserve our respect.” He continued : “ Because the Hejaz was in the hands of the Turks and because Great Britain was at war with Turkey it would have been to the advantage of the British to invade the Hejaz in order to attack the Turk but out of respect to us and our religion they did not do bo.”Risaldar-Major Gul Nawaz's personal impressions. I must first of all thank the British Government for their kindness and assistance to us all and for selecting us for this visit—we greatly appreciate this fact and only hope that our visit may be of some service to the Govern ment. We were delighted with all we saw, with our cordial reception by the Sheriff and for the success of the pilgrimage and the arrangements made to make it so. Our impressions of the Sheriff himself are that he is a man of the highest integrity and best ideals and I have every faith that he is to be fully relied on to act to the best of his ability in the highest motives both in the interests of his subjects and Islam as a whole. He personally sees to every thing he possibly can, works tremendously hard and has the greatest influence overplus Arabs, who have absolute trust in him and yet fear him at the same time. I saw Arabs kissing every portion of him they could reach, although he tried to send them away, with the most Unbounded affection. He makes no distinction in the way he treats people dealing courteously with poor and noble alike. I am convinced as a Mussalman, having learnt all I have and seen what I have seen that the Sheriff did right to break away from the Turks. I consider it to he in the best interests of all Mussalmans to support him in bis present endeavours.^ 'We were greatly struck with the amount of poor people in Mecca; the Sheriff distributes £10 a day to the poor of the city and 7,000 loaves of bread daily to the poor of the city, at the time of the blockade when food was scarce and prices high the Sheriff shared the food of the poor. Money is undoubtedly scarce in the city. The arrangements made for the comfort of the pilgrims were excellent considering the state of affairs, the pilgrims seemed very contented and happy. Erom all accounts it was the greatest improvement on past pilgrimages. Gul Nawaz's ideas of how the visit might he turned to account. lirstly .—I can guarantee that I can instill the correct ideas into my own clan .and its neighbours because from my heart I can say that I fully believe in the right of the Sheriff. And when I tell my people about the true state of affairs I know it will have a great effect on them. Secondly .—I can tell you what the true feeling is among my clan, ex plaining to you the real deep-rooted ideas that are causing dissension. Knowing this you will be better able to judge what line of action to take. Thirdly .—I propose that certain Mohammadan gentlemen of India be invited to visit the Sheriff and I am convinced this would have a good effect. Fourthly .—I recommend the machine gun detachments proposed being sent from France, the Sheriff needs them badly. Finally, I do not pretend to influence the wide world with what I have seen and heard, but as far as in me lies (not because I want to please the British Government but because I firmly believe in the justice of the Sheriff’s cause) I will do my best to make people realize the truth. 100 Telegram P., No. 873^8., dated the 14th November 1916.

No control has been given to Aziz Masri and he has not been told his numbers (sic).. lie has been trying to obtain approval of his various schemes out of Sheriff Ali who approves generally in principle, but then hinders passively. It is perhaps partly owing to Sheriff of Mecca’s command, and there has been fear of giving power to a military officer who might become an Enver. Aziz Masri is again approaching Sheriff Ali for a measure of control, failing which, he threatens to return to Egypt. When matters ripen,. I will press Sheriff Ali, as I think Aziz Masri is right. Egyptian Artillery is home sick. Parker has been asked whether he would like to have a talk to Abdallah and endeavour to get Sheriff to give more control to Aziz Masri.

It is with great pleasure that I inform Your Excellency that at a meeting to-day Ulemas and notables of country and all classes of population unanimously recognised His Majesty the Grand Sheriff Bin Ali as King of Arab nation. By this act His Majesty becomes Sovereign of Arabs. The country has been impressed by bis perfect loyalty towards his country, by his diplomatic capacity, and by his sincere desire to spread benefits of justice and education throughout all Arab regions, and to deliver them from the yoke of the Union and Progress, a gang notorious for aims and actions which are contrary to every principle and every law, and for its formal resolve to bring the Arab country to moral and material ruin. The effects of this resolve may be seen in the tortures endured by a great number of Mahometans, Christians and Druses, whose sincere devotion to their country and intellectual41 worth are their only crime?.

From—The British High Commissioner in Egypt, Cairo, To—His Excellency the Viceroy. (Addressed to Sirdar; repeated to Foreign Office, London.) Please refer to telegram No. 436 from Wilson. The action of the Sheriff appears premature and ill-advised. The only indication we had that anything of this nature was intended wns a remark made by Abdulla in course of conversation to Storrs who told him that so wild an idea could not ever be conveyed to higher authority. Do you concur in the following telegram to Wilson which I propose to issue. “ Please refer to your telegram No. 436. If it should be believed that any such premature announcement, emanated from the Sheriff himself and if it should be published outside Uediaz in Moslem countries where Sheriff’s action and motives are still regarded with distrust, it may have most unfortunate effects on Arab cause. He should be informed that I deprecate an announcement of this nature and that it seems most inadvisable at a time when Sheriff is not in a position fully to substantiate such claims made on his behalf. Publication of it must be confined strictly to Hedjaz in any case. His Majesty’s Government is being informed and they will, I feel sure, be unable at present to make public recognition of Sheriff as Champion of Arab people against Turkish oppression and supreme Ruler of Hedjaz. His Majesty’s Government have repeatedly declared that religious supremacy in Islam is a question which Moslems must decide for themselves without outside interference or influence. Further comment upon it is unnecessary for me beyond expressing the opinion that the publication of announcement of Mecca Ulemas on this subject outside Hedjaz is in my opinion premature and liable to give rise to undesirable criticism and even opposition in certain Moslem countries at a time when all efforts should be directed at gaining sympathy and support of whole Moslem world for the Sheriff’s cause and consolidating his position. Assistance given to Sheriff for the purpose of securing Arab independence may, moreover, be rendered by it open to danger of violation of the guarantee not to interfere with the religious affairs of Moslems”. 45 Telegram P., No. 953, dated the 1st (received 2nd) November 1916.

Hostility of Ibn Sa’ud to the ^jman. Sheikh Bada’ibn Asghor of the Naja* section of the ’A]man arrived at Kuwait on October 4th seeking sanctuary from Ibn Sa’ud. The Naja’ are the section to which belongs the Hithlain family, the paramount Shaikhly house of the ’Ajman. They are closely connected with the Sifran who are the most redoubted section of the tribe. Shaikh Jabir Ibn Subah refused to allow Bada’ and his people to settle in Kuwait and they will probably go to Safwan where some of the Sifran and Naja’ are already settled under Sultan Ibn Hithlain. It is difficult to see the outcome of Ibn Sa’ud’s implacable hostility towards the Ajman. Since the death of his brother Sa’ud, who was killed in battle against them in July 1915 under Hofuf, he has pursued the Ajman Shaikhs with his enmity and taken umbrage when any asylum was afforded them in Kuwait. Shaikh Mubarak openly disapproved of his policy towards the tribe and when the fugitive Shaikhs came up from the Hasa he allowed them domicile in his territory. Neither Shaikh Zabir nor the Shaikh of Zubair, though they both look askance on this powerful and untrustworthy tribe, will consent to assist Ibn Sa’ud in his avowed attempt to exterminate them and his attitude has resulted in a cooling down of the friendly feelings which to a certain extent still subsisted between himself and Kuwait. Moreover, both Zubair and Kuwait recognise that while Ibn Sa’ud will not succeed destroying the whole ’Ajman tribe, he will probably drive them, if he has his way, into the arms of ‘Ajaimi and Ibn Rashid. When aswering Ihn Sa’ud in arious connections (certain instructions from Government are awaited before Bin Sa’ud is addressed) Chief Political Officer will endeavour to induce Bin Sa’ud to adopt a more reasonable attitude in this connection. 50 Telegram No. 958, dated the 2nd (received 3rd) November 1916.

(3) Originally the Sheriffs of Mecca were not under Turkish rule; they agreed to he so of their own accord and not on account of conquest.

Translation of a letter from Chief Political Officer, to Amir Abdul Aziz Al Faisal Al Saood, &lt; 3 dated Basrah, October 18th 1916. After compliments.— Exwgt for my letter of the 29th August 1916, as kin o 1 vou to co-operate in the matter of the purchase of camels, it is a con siderable time since I have been able to write to Your Excellency on the other hand since my last lengthy communication, I have received several welcome letters from yourself. In them you have touched on a number ot subjects with most of which I can deal more conveniently in separate com munications. I propose to confine this particular letter to the most important s ^ b J^ ct which you have discussed; viz., the rising of the Sheriff Hussein and ms operations against the Turks in Hedjaz. You have written on this subject m vour letters of the 18th llamazan (=20th July), 15th Shawwal (=^loth August) and 4th Dhilqadah (=3rd September). In the first letter you reminded me oi vour past relations with the Sheriff, and told me what you feared his designs might be now, that it is to say you anticipated that he might have some intention of interfering in Nejd as he had done before, and you asked me communicate your views and fears to His Majesty’s Government. Iu ymi second letter you wrote to say that you had received letters from the Sherm,49 arising you to unite yourself with him and to render him assistance, and you continued that pending your learning the views of the British Government, you had replied to the Sheriff that if he was sincere in his intentions towards you, he should first give you a solemn undertaking to abstain in future from all intrusion within your limits and among your tribes. \ou wrote that vou would communicate again with me when you received his reply. Lastly, I have youi letter of the 3rd September in which you explained that you would like to be informed whether the question of co-operation with the Sheriff or of attacking Bin Rashid was considered by us to be merely a matter of the internal politics of the Arab Chiefs, or whether they were ques tions in which the interests of the British Government were also involved. I have thought it convenient thus to summarize Your Excellency’s letters, so that your enquiries could be more clearly answered. On receipt of your communications, I referred to my Government as you desired me, and because it was not possible for me to give you the authority to answer without doing so, there has been as a result some delay in the com munication of this reply to Your Excellency. The result of my reference is this :— As regards the Sheriff’s intentions, His Majesty’s Government, according to the information and knowledge which they possess, have no reason what ever to think that he has any evil intention against your tribes or your territories. On the contrary His Excellency regards Your Excellency as his friend and co-adjutor; and as for ourselves vis a-vis yourself and the Sheriff, have we not our treaty with you in article one of which we have recognized you as independent ruler of your territories of Nejd? Of course the Sheriff must naturally recognize this treaty also, and His Majesty’s Government would by no means support him in any other attitude towards von. * As to the question of co-operation wdth the Sheriff, or abstention from oo-operation, and your enquiry as to whether this is a matter of the politics of the Arabs, or whether the interests of the British Government are also involved; I will try to make the position clear to you. It is not hidden from you that in the first instance, Great Britain had no wish to go to war with Turkey; but it became necessary simply because Turkey fell under the control of Germany w ho thrust her into hostilities with us. But when by decree of fate a state of war arose, the British Government said to themselves “ Now that the Turks have gratuitously plunged into war with us, we will have no more of them, and w r e will do our best to expel them from Iraq and Arabia, so that in future we may be immune from the results of their intrigues and maladministration and in order that the rulers and the tribes of the Arabs may gain freedom from such a tyrannical Government and achieve a prosperous future You will see therefore that it is the object and interest of the British Government to expel the Turks from Arabia. You will agree also that it is to the vital interest of Your Excellency, and of the Sheriff, and of the other great leaders of the Arab countries and tribes to expel the Turks. Thus the object of the British . Government and the object of the Chiefs of the Arab States are one and the same ; and it i&amp; therefore in the interests of us all that there should be co-operation between all, so that the common object may be realised. It is for these reasons that the British Government greatly desire the success of the Sheriff, and regard it as highly desirable and most important that you should co-operate with him to the utmost of your power. It is not hidden from you that your name carries a great prestige among the Arabs, and, according to my information, many of the Sheikhs are only waiting to see what your attitude is before deciding upon their own. If they hear that Bin Saud is openly supporting and helping the Sheriff, they will2 VVYVWV 50 ouiekly take up arms in his behalf; but if, on the other hand they hear that Itin Sand is standin' aloof, they also will stand aloof. You will see, theretore, how important it is that you should make it clear to the Arab public that you, the Ruler of Nejd, are in sympthy with the Sheriff, and are assisting him to expel the Turks from Arabia. , , , . t . As to how you can best do that, whether by helping him with money and men, or by attacking Bin Rashid, or by winning the latter over to your side, this is a question which you can best decide for yourself H,s Majesty s Government do not wish to press you to do this or to do that; all they wish von to understand is that your open support, whether it be moral or active, will be of great advantage to the Sheriff's cause and to the common object. You know best how you can most probtably assist the Sheriff without serious prejudice to important interests of your own. In short I am sure you will realise from the above that it is of the highest importance that not only the British Government but all the Chiefs of Arabs like yourself whose present and future interests demand expulsion of the Turks from Arabia, should at this time concentrate their resources and energies on the achievement of that common object. Compared with that rrreat object, all other objects and interests become for the present insignificant and need to he deferred until the main object is achieved (such for instance as the matter of the Ajraan about which I will write to you separately . This letter has assumed such length, that I will leave discussion of the other matters for another letter which I will send via Bahrein in a few day s time. As regards the general war, things are going very well indeed with the Allies in Europe: Roumania has joiued us and Greece has joined and the Allies* armies are gradually closing on the enemy from all^ sides. Here iu Iraq, owin* to the great heat and the long line of communications, no active operations have been going on for some weeks, but now the conditions are changing ; the weather is getting cold, and the water will soon rise; and our forces in° Mesopotamia are much superior to the enemy. But the actual operations are conducted in accordance with the general plan prescribed in the councils of the Allies in Europe, so that it is not in my power to say that we are going to advance on this date or on that date, or in this direction or is that direction. But this you may know that ail is going thoroughly well with us, and (incidentally) there are signs that many of the small tribes around Nasiriyah, who have been endeavouring to annoy us in small matters at the instigation of the Turks have got tired of the deceptions and false pro mises of emissaries like Mizkar Raska, and are inclined to ask our forgiveness and seek friendship with us. I do not wish to trouble you more for the present, for this is sufficiently long. Another letter will follow in a few day’s time. May you be preserved and salaam, Chief Political Officer. ' J 'll!

From—The Sardar, Khartoum, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla (repeated Cairo). Order for a British brigade to be held in readiness at Suez for transport to Babegh has been cancelled and flight aeroplanes now on their way by steamer to Rabegh have been recalled, in consequence of His Majesty’s Government’s instructions that landing of British troops on coast of Hedjaz should not be undertaken. This decision of His Majesty’s Government has been communicated to Sheriff Abdulla by Wilson. While appreciating political objections to such employment of British troops, Abdulla asked whether reconsideration were not possible in regard to landing of aeroplanes, more especially as they were urgently required (he considered) to cope with plans co-operating w r itk Turkish troops at Bir (Obj ?) Abbas. Wilson has received instructions from me to inform Abdulla that His Majesty’s Government’s decision is final and to emphasise iact that, apart from pure military considerations, it is based on this desire to refrain from action involving co-operation of British troops with Arabs ■which could be construed into a violation of Islamic principles and of British guarantees re garding inviolability of Holy Places and would be therefore calculated to excite Moslem susceptibilities in British Empire and elsewhere. These considerations do not affect Sheriff’s acceptance of Moslem Arab contingent despatched from Algiers by French Government now on its way to Suez. Sheriff will probably, therefore, accept the bulk of this contingent which may be of considerable assistance, if it arrives in time, and enable him to repel the threatened Turkish advance (of which Arabs are increasingly apprehensive) upon Rabegh or Mecca. 22a MEMORANDUM.

Enclosure to Serial No. 27. Report on meeting with the Sheriff Faisal Bey at Yanboj August 27th and 28th, 1916. 1 left Jeddah on August 21st in H. M. S. “Hardinge” (Commander Linbury, R.N.) and arrived Yanbo at 9 A. M. on the 25th. Sheikh Abdel Kbader Abdu, who acts as private representative of the Sheriff at Yanbo, came and saw me at once. I gave him a letter for Faisal Bey in which I stated I was coming to his Camp, this letter was passed to El Said Mohamed Ahmed Ibn Bedawi (the official representative of the Sheriff) a man I did not trust and who was looked upon with contempt by the other Chiefs. He sent my letter off, but at the same time, as Faisal found out afterwards, sent a message to the Turks to warn them of my intended visit to Faisal’s Camp. Faisal is sending the man to Mecca on some excuse and is informing the Sheriff who will deal with him there. I tried to leave on the afternoon of the 25th and again on the 26th, but was always met with excuses for delay, the reason for which is now of course apparent. On the afternoon of the 26th, Sheriff Abdullah Ibn Tawaad, a trusted friend and relation of Faisal’s, who is collecting Arab recruits at Yanbo, came to see me and at once arranged that I should leave the next morning with an. escort of 150 Ashraf Sheikbs and men. Wfhile he was with me I received a reply from Faisal to say that he was on his way to Yanbo and would arrive early the next morning, the 27th. I arranged to ride out to meet him and left at 6 a.m. with Sheriff Abdulla, accompanied by some 80 Sheikhs, 150 camelmen and about 800 Arab Rifle men. We went out about 4 miles until we met Faisal, who was escorted by about 200 camelmen and horsemen, and after greetings between the two parties which included an inspiring speech from Hussein Rouhi to everyone in general, we returned to Yanbo, Faisal and I riding together. He accom panied me on board H. M. S. “ Hufferin” for some light refreshment, when it was arranged for further meetings, one for 3 p.m. that afternoon, which lasted till 8 p.m., and another on the morning of the 28th, which lasted from 10 a.m. to 1 P.M.13 Paisal is about 28 years of age and struck me as being an exceedingly nice man, well educated and altogether impressing me very favourably. Though he may at times perhaps be inclined to exaggerate matters, it is clear h e regards his position as very critical, and I think there is no doubt that it is so. He opened by saying that he would like to start from the beginning, to which I assented and kept notes throughout. The following is practically what he said :— He had written from Syria to the Sheriff in May strongly urging that the revolt should not take place for at least two months : before, however, lie g ()t a reply to this he was ordered back to the Hedjaz, and 7 da)s alter his return the revolt broke out. When the revolt occurred numerous tribes joined at once, some had only old guns and others only flint-locks. He attacked the Turks on the railway and pulled up lengths of the lino, but lack of arms forced him later on to lea re the neighbourhood of the railway, and he therefore sent messengers to all tribes with whom lie could iret into touch to obtain ammunition, and urgent messages to the Sheriff stating that no proper attack on Medina could take place owing to lack ol arms. He proceeded to destroy the railway in various places dividing his force into three parties, one close to Medina, another at Dursieh (10 kilometres north of Medina), and the third at Hafira (40 miles north of Medina), his object being to capture the ports at Bowat and Hafira. Eventually be was forced to abandon this idea since each night the Turks repaired the damage done with the aid of construction and armoured trains, against which he couid not compete. ■ His original intention was to go to Medain Salih where he expected rifles to be sent him for arming the Anazeh and the Geheina tribes, but as none were forthcoming he was forced to remain with Ali Bey. Most of the Anazeh Sheikhs remained waiting a long time near the rail way, and Eaisal continued to send them messages that arms would surely come next week, &amp;c., until at last the tribes and others began telling him' “ You promise arms and food, and none come ”, the result being that they have now all dispersed. He hoped Great Britain would help quickly and to the utmost limit, and he blamed the Sheriff for not realising the seriousness of the situation, even at the beginning of the revolt. Early in July he was only a few miles from Medina and saw the Turkish reinforcements arriving. He and Ali consulted together as to whether they would remain where they were or retire since the Turks were beirinnin' to come out of Medina; they decided to remain hoping that arms and &lt;nms would he sent before the Turks really attacked. At this time they had three camps of 3 0,000 Arabs each, but notone camp had 2,000 good rifles. About the middle of July the Turks began to attack and heavy fi^htin? occurred for most of the day until the Arabs had no ammunition left. ° Ali then ordered a retirement to Ghadir of Medina). , Rageh (about 14 miles south Soon afterwards five hundred Japanese rifles arrived which they could not use, as the ammunition sometimes did not fit and many were broken. Eaisal thinks Sheikh Hussein of Rabegh did this. him Am Zt r t H ai3a i u S ° D ° rth ] ward ® as otherwise the Arabs might leave Beni Salim joinedhimt,iere: .U J heir u r , etreat was solel y due t0 want of arms and they be-an to think that operations^ ^ the Shuritf had for S otte “ ^ about the Medina Early in Angust Eaisal received 2,500 English rifles which they like very £;«»“:rcr ta ‘ *•'»»* »»■' il is bS VAbout this time the Turks proclaimed Haidar Pasha as Emir and Grand Sheriff of Mecca, and during the last month gold has been lavished right and left among the ttibes. Up to August 21st there has been continual fightin^ since the end of July, Paisal gradually retiring every now and then, by'which means he increases the length of the Turkish line of communication with Medina. The force opposite him consists, he is certain, of three Allai (about 9,000 men) with an independent Tabour, an Allai of camelry (about 700 men) and cavalry (500) : roughly about 1,200. About 6,000 against Ali Hey, and 6,&lt; 00 in Medina and in lines of communication. (By careful cross-examination’ these figures may be cheeked fairly accurately by’questioning the Turkish Yusbasbi who left in H. M. 8 ‘'Scotia ” yesterday for cmez with 7 privates.) Faisal has been gradually retreating along the Sultani Ptond, and his main headquarters are now at Khaif which commands the road at Bir Abbas, the nearest gorge in the mountains, after which the road opens out down to the sea coast. It is now impossible for him to push the Turks back, and if the latter make a really strong and sustained attack he states they will succeed in breaking through, in which case he fears most of his Arabs will disperse, but in this event he, himself, with all who remain with him will keep harrying the Turkish rear and lines of communication. As Ali found that the force opposite him at Hafer was acting on the defensive, he decided to make a bold sweeping movement to try and get between Medina and the Turks who are against Faisal. Ali left Ilafer on August 26th, and it will take him at least 10 days to get round. Faisal lays great stress upon having some trained troops with him, or even at Yanbo or Babegh, which would enable him to try and take the offensive and enormously encourage the Arabs, many of whom do not yet believe that Great Britain is really hacking the Sheriff. These Arabs say that Great Britain is stronger than Germany and ask why she does not help. Faisal asked that Great Britain should do for the Arabs one-tenth of what the Germans are doing for the Turks. I asked Faisal if he would like the Arab capital, Army and Country to be under the British Government as the Turkish Empire is now under Germany. To this of course he replied “JNo”. I asked him if he knew of all the British Government had done to help the Arabs. He replied expressing his ignorance. 1 then proceeded to tell him that trained men for blowing up the railway had been sent to Port Sudan but were stopped from coming across by the Sheriff: that dynamite for them to use had been sent back by the Sheriff from Jeddah : that 60 odd boxes of bombs had been on board a warship for weeks as the Sheriff said he did not want them landed. I told him ali this, thinking it as well for Faisal to know that ull the blame for the shortage of munitions did not lie at the door of the British Government. Faisal went as near cursing his saintly father, as I suppose a son of a Grand Sheriff could, and added “ my father tries to do everything but is not a soldier. ,, Having had a month’s experience of the old gentleman I was able to agree cordially. Faisal stated that he considered his position most critical and that he dare not return to his troops until he could tell them help teas coming; I do not know if I succeeded in persuading him to give up this absurd attitude, but I did my best. He said that he had suggested to the Sheriff that he and his force should leave the Medina district and go to Mecca in readiness to defend it. On being told that the Sheriff objected to British officers coming with Egyptian troops unless dressed as Arabs, he swore, and assured me that if British troops landed and put on Arab cloaks he would (want?) them to discard them, as what he wanted was to show the Arabs that Great Britain was really helping, which knowledge would do an enormous amount to buck up the Arabs and would make “ fence-sitters ” get down on the Sheriff’s side. All Arabs loathe the Turks and have the greatest opinion of the might of Great Britain.14 He formulated his urgent requests as follows : — 1. Three thousand trained troops to represent Great Britain even if they remained at Yanbo or Rabegh. 2. Aeroplanes. 3. Permanent cutting of the railway which would bring in the northern tribes and have the greatest effect. 4. Mountain and machine guns. 5. Rifles. Regarding 1.—As I telegraphed yesterday, the Sheriff will only sanction about 300 British troops, who would ostensibly be an escort to the aeroplanes ; if half a battalion could be spared and stationed at Yaubo or Rabeuh it would have a good effect. At the former place there is a condenser which requires, coal, but at the latter place I have no personal knowledge of the water-supply. I shall be in a better position to judge after visiting Rabegh ; hut at present I am inclined to think that—providing the water-supply can be arranged— Rabegh will be the best place for the aeroplane depot and for any troops which may be sent; this would give Faisal a position to fall back upon if the worst happens; he would also probably have the support of the guns of some patrol ships. Regarding 2.—I have sent Faisal a letter telling him that aeroplanes are coming, which is excellent news, I have also informed the Sheriff who expressed his gratitude. Regarding 3.—I quite appreciate the difficulties of the Commander-in- Chief (Arbur’s telegram No. 1296, dated 30th August). My point is that—in my opinion—the permanent cutting of the Hedja&amp; Railway, so as to prevent the despatch of any reinforcements,, is (especially now that aeroplanes, guns and machine guns are coming) the most urgent and important operation necessary at the present moment; whether my various recommendations are possible, or not, to carry out, I have no means of knowing at the time they are made, but I assume it*to be my duty to make such as I consider necessary. If the proposed operations north of Yanbo turn out alright, I am hoping that operations from Akaba will start as soon as Colonel Parker returns to Suez. Regarding 4. Simbashi Hassan Effendi Zeki arrived yesterday with men and mules, the two guns are expected here about 6th from Suez, meanwhile, I am getting Zeki Effendi on to training Arabs in artillery work. Regarding 5.—-I have persuaded the Sheriff to send the whole 5,00C brou£rht by H. M. S. ‘Suva to haisal, and the “Fox” is, I believe, bringing the remainder, 2,500. ° &amp; -^ ,a l sa l informed me that if the railway was cut he would require 15,000 rifles to arm the Anazeh and other tribes who would at once join, but are at mostl ‘ V u uaai ’med; I suggest 10,000 be earmarked for this purpose if 15,000 cannot be obtained. Sent to Arab Bureau. I attach a plan drawn by Ruin’s assistant from a rough plan I worked out with Faisal; I doubt its accu racy, but it may be of use. a f 1S ° a !u aCh a -, n ! eSSaSe reCeiTed from sl &gt;enff which I have no time to “•‘'“'““““I.

The whole of this town is seething with unrest, constant rumours arrive from Kabegh that the Turks are advancing; several of Haidar’s proclamations have been brought in, and a reverse to Faisal would have a very bad effect, and possibly would prevent any pilgrims leaving here for Mecca. I am well aw are that the fate of Arabia and all other spheres of opera tions depends on our success on the Western Front and that even if the Turks rcoccupy the lledjaz, Arabia after the war—will be free and independent; but to allow this to take place will not tend to make the Sheriff and Arab chiefs our loyal and faithful friends, and will seriously impair our prestige and influence in the future, to retain and gain which is surely worth an effort now. To His Excellency the Viceroy of India with the compliments of the High Commissioner. I have the honour to forward, herewith, for Your Lordship’s information, copies of extracts from the diary of Mr. Storrs, written during his recent visit with the Naval Commander-in-Chief to the Hedjaz, and dated Jeddah, Septem* her 27th, and Rabegh, September 29th. I have sent copies of these extracts to India. Leaving the “ Euryalus” at 9-30 a.m. we steamed in the barge, towing behind us a whaler, towards the town of Jeddah. After about half-an-hour we ran very slightly aground and, changing into the whaler, were pulled past fairly well marked beacons close into the shore. Whilst we were still about a quarter of a mile from the landing place, a small fleet of about 20 dhows came sailing majestically round the corner out of the harbour. We had hardly time to do more than admire the sight when we found ourselves caught both on the right and left by the advancing flotilla, which, amid the customary babel of imprecations threatened to bump us in on either side. Emerging successfully from this ordeal we drew up at a little jetty to a salute of 18 guns fired from antique mortars. We were received by the Sheriff Mohsin ; Sheriff Taha Ibn Muhanna; Sulayman Qabil, Head of the Municipality; the absurd Syrian, C. Wilson, Colonel. 28 Dated Residency, Cairo, the 6th October 1916.

The Viscount Grey of Fallodon, K.G., &amp;c., &amp;c&gt;, &amp;c. Enclosure No. 2. Extract from Diary. Jeddah, 27th September 1916.Director of Public Security; a very presentable young Arab Police Officer named Rauf Bey; and of course Wilson with my ubiquitous and ineffable Ruhi. They appeared really glad to see us, and conducted the Admiral up two flights of wooden stairs to the office of the quarantine, where armchairs were arranged and coffee served. After about a quarter of an hour’s friendly con versation, in which we had occasion to admire the presence and manner of the Sheriff Mohsin, we left the quarantine and, very tolerably mounted upon a collection of local animals, ranging from Turkish officers’ chargers to Municipality mules, proceeded to the Goveruorate where more or less the same ceremonies were performed. Having absorbed another coffee and another lemonade, we passed on to the Drench Consulate to return yesterday’s visit of Colonel Bremont, whom we found comfortably installed with his staff, includ ing a foxy-looking Consul, titnlaire at Jeddah for some 18 months before the outbreak of the war. I found afterwards that the latter had produced an identical and most unfavourable impression upon every member of our party; also that the presence of the French in Jeddah is very far from popular, panly because of their very bad reputation as colonists in Muslim countries, and partly owing to the well-founded mistrust felt by the better-informed Arabs for all forms of international control. Having passed some ten minutes in the interchange of civilities and the consumption of a third series of soft drinks, we passed on to the British Con sulate, an agreeable house, admirably built to suit the climatic conditions of the country. Wilson and his two Assistants, Youni? (of the Egyptian Ministry of Finance) and Cochrane (of Gellatly Hankey &amp; Co.) have more or less settled down with two Syrian clerks, an adequate supply of typewriters, Ruhi and his inefficient and unpopular understudy. Wilson took occasion to impart to me privately more than once his extreme gratification at the effects of the Admiral’s visit to the town. He said that his position, both before the French mission and also in the eyes of the Arabs, had been thereby raised in a manner he had up till now scarcely dared to dream possiole. Before long Ruhi arrived with a telephonic message from the Grand Sheriff at Mecca inviting the Admiral to a public banquet‘in Jeddah to-morrow night. Tins he was fortunately able to decline with the sufficiently valid excuse of proceeding at once to Rabegh upon the Grand Sheriff’s business. I thought it better to reply for the Admiral myself, and going down to the tele- phone’rang up No. 1 Mecca. After a short pause, I distinguished what I rightly took to be the tones ot the Grand Sheriff himself, bidding me a warm and affectionate welcome to Jeddah, and anxiously asking me whether the Admiral would accept his hospitality. At this moment three or four other voices became audible on the wire, and I remarked to the Sheriff that in my opinion we were being tapped. He said it was quite impossible that this should be tile case at .Mecca. I replied that I did not know from which end the sounds aho' He’slTdh oM “T/* 1 * hea f d ,hem ’ and asked him whether he did not ai 0 He said he did, and I immediately had the satisfaction of hearing him ea 1 through to the Central in stronger language than 1 had expected from so holy a mau, ordering them to cut off everybody’s instrument in the H^dias excepting bis own and mine for the next half hour. This was instantly done and we conversed henceforth in a silence resembling that of death the htialttl a ' d congratulating him upon the Admirll to hk o^ ^ 6 reaS0DS wbich Diade ^Possible for tne Admnai to be his guest to-morrow night. I impressed unon him the great pleasure it had been to the Admiral to have th* d ,P . the Holv Carnet tn Hwir, i i i • e 1 le il0ri0 ur of conveying 0 , ce more emnhasi^^tl^f y i La ? d \ aDd P ° lnted out on Uis behalf hc &gt; w we had ooce more empliasised the tact, which not even German calumnies had been able to obscure, that we were the truest and since,est friend ot lslam He seemed to appreciate this and added that he knew that a nation that observed ih, wn religion so well as the British could hardly fail to re pent those of17 ■flras sufficiently obvious, that at this of all seasons, his own presence in Mecca was imperative. ^ At the conclusion, however, of the ceremonies attending the pilgrimage, it was his firm intention either to send his son Ahdalla to Cairo, in order to get into touch with the authorities there, or else to come down to Jeddah himself, in which latter case, he hoped to be able to repair his present omission. I here took occasion to present the compliments and messages of His Excellency the High Commissioner, which His Highness returned with the greatest appreciation and cordiality. He spoke verv much more hopefully than his recent letters had led one to expect about the situation in the Hedjaz, so much so that at one moment he threw out a feeler deprecating the assistance of the French Government. Failing to com prehend this allusion, I answered that God wmuld doubtless give’the victory to the forces of the true believers, a pious sentiment leaving no reply other than that of unctuous assent. After about 20 minutes most friendly interesting and animated conversation, I said I was sure his lunch time had arrived, and so gave him the opportunity of ringing off, promising to bid him farewell before leaving Jeddah. In company with Ruhi, I visited the house of the leading Persian of Jeddah, a Bahai, who has rendered us considerable service in providin' 1 - inform ation himself, and also protecting some of our secret agents. I rode twice through the bazaars, stopping and talking with some few of the merchants, and observing no more fanaticism than is to be found during the tourist season in the Cairo Muski. I also called upon a certain Muhammad Nasif, a prominent citizen of Egyptian origin, wdio was most anxious to obtain British nationality, and asked me point blank w r hat we meant by dragging the French into the country. Finding that there would hardly be another opportunity I again rang up the Sheriff, and bade him a good-bye which somehow- extended itself into a fair quarter of an hour. After lunch with Young and Cochrane (who appeared to me to be sadly overworked) I walked down through the Municipality to the jetty in order to meet and take on board the “ Euryalus ” the Sheriff Mohsin and his friends. They insisted on my going with them in the Municipal launch so far as the “Fox,” where we transhipped to the Admiral’s barge, reaching the “ Euryalus ” about 4 p.m. Here, not only the Sneriff and his party, but also their numerous and most disreputable looking guard were shown in general and in detail over the more easily understood features of the “ Euryalus The big guns struck them so much that they could not at first believe them to be guns at all. The signalling and the loading drill impressed them na less, and the size, comfort and cleanliness of the Admiral’s cabin came in for admiring comment. But it was the guns in the end which produced the greatest effect, and the party, after partaking of tea and performing their evening prayers upon the stern walk, left the ship in a state of mind divided between awe and an intense satisfaction at having demonstrably espoused the winning cause. I was pleased to note that the greatest impression seemed to be produced upon the Sheriff Mohsin and Sulayman Qabil, the most consider able and most intelligent members of the party. The former remarked “ What w’e have seen is a representation, in little, of the great British Empire itself ”, and the latter informed me that he had not up till that moment realized that so large a ship could float upon the surface of the waters. As an immediate and tangible result of the afternoon’s proceedings, the Admiral was officially invited to ride at the head of the procession, through Jeddah, of the Holy Carpet itself—an honour wdiich we prudently, if reluctantly, thought lit to decline. As soon as the barge came back from the “ Fox ”, the Admiral went on board the “ Hardinge” to return the official morning visit of Fatin Pasha, Amir al Hagg, the General-in-Command of the Egyptian Mahmal and Pilgrimage. The General was, as he had been in the early morning, still attired in nis pilgrim’s bath towel costume and sandals completed by an officer’s belt, and tne salute was played by a military band with conductor all similarly18 i ■&gt;- apparelled. As T left the Pasha whispered to rpe in Arabic that he was exceedingly flattered by the Admiral’s visit, which had given great satisfaction to his Egyptian pilgrims. The evening’s amenities concluded with a display from 8 to 8-15 P.M., of the combined searchlights of the British Ships of War assembled in the harbour. Enclosure No. 3. Extract from diary. Eabegh, 2Sth September 1913. On rising I fathered from Ruhi that there had been some misunderstand ing with regard to the mes'sage from the Sheriff Ali, delivered on our arrival by the interpreter of the “ Dufferin Far from making any difficulties, Ah had prepared not only horses but also Kuffiyas (head scarves) against the sun for our benefit. He ca ie aboard about 7-30; slight, gentle, handsome and distinguished, a little under middle height, with a weakish chin under a small pointed beard. He was dressed in a black Abaya (cloak), silk Ivuffiya and golden Aigal (woollen scarfholder); his very small and shapely feet enclosed in Stambul Court elastic-sided boots complete with rudimentary spurs. He was accompanied by his military adviser lor the time being, Nuri Bey of Baghdad; one of the Arab prisoners we have released from India, in khaki uniform and Kuffiya. We gave them coffee on the bridge, in the course of which I found Ali both courteous and agreeable. Just before 8 we went ashore, and donned, with very remarkable effect, the red Kuffiyas over our helmets. (It was of course manifest that these Kuffiyas had been provided less as a protection against the sun than to shield Ali himself from hostile Arab criticism at the bringing of helmeted Christians into the interior of the Hedjaz.) We then mounted our beasts and set off to inspect the lines of defence against a Turkish force attempiing to break through to Jeddah or Mecca from Medina by Rabegh, the only practicable way. I left the Sheriff Ali, with Ruhi, to the Admiral as much as possible, but this was not much, for whenever I dropped back he would look about, turn round and cry “Why do you ride behind 0 Mister ? ” and beckon me back to his side. We crossed a plain stretch of sand looking towards Jebel {Subh making for the right Hank of the presumed Arab position, thence coming round the centre and returned by their hypothetical left wing ; the ride lasting from 8-15 to 11-50. The line (upon which as yet no stroke of -work has been done) lies roughly astride of the Sultani Road from Medina to Rabegh, and ship’s guns at 7000 yards range could certainly cover the flanks by day, it being supposed that the Turks could scarcely venture on attempting to slip through the intermediate belt of palm groves (about 4500 yards range) by night. In the course of a long, but necessarily somewhat disjointed, conversation with the Sheriff Ali, I was astonished to find that he had not yet heard of the death of Lord Kitchener, in spite of an elaborate letter we had sent to his lather. He observed with truth that he had been in the desert more than three months and had seen no newspapers, a defect we must lose no time in repair- ing J (I had already made a start in this direction with fifty of my Arabic Raemakers mitigated by 500 fresh Egyptian cigarettes. The Sheriff seems to smoke almost without interruption). I explained to him our grave reluct ance at sending British troops even to the coast of the Hedjaz, and he seemed to agree that from the Arab point of view it would be, save under imperious necessity, a heavy blunder. He said that three batteries of quick-firing guus, one for defence, and tw r o for a possible advance against Medina would suffice .them. Unlike Nuri, who is lair at French, and lias had the energy to pick up in India a smattering of English, Ali knows nothing but Arabic, in which he shows signs of being a fine scholar. On the whole, he appears to have more}\ ff 19 rtliarin than strength of character; and I consider him distinctly inferior in grip and decision to his younger brother Abdalla, undoubtedly the ruling spirit of the clan. TVe passed the red standard of Mecca, flying over the tents, because it was Friday, and dismounted at the shore. R.

The original and a translation have been sent to the Arab Bureau, Basrah, for such action as they think fit. hurther copies are now being sent from Jeddah, addiessed personally to certain Sheikhs, whose names were indicated by the Basrah authorities.

Translation, In order to avoid any misunderstanding or doubt with regard to the true nature of our movement, we, the people of Hedjaz, find it meet to supplement our first proclamation (in which we treated of the causes of the movement) with these lines to help the world in general, and the Moslems in particular, to be fully cognisant of our intentions and aims that are connected with our present integrity by recurring to the most recent occurrences and the simplest facts. All know that sensible Moslems, living in Turkey and elsewhere, do not approve of the Government’s policy in entering this war, for several im portant reasons upon which they are all agreed. One of these reasons is the fact that the Government had freshly emerged from two successive wars—the Tripoli War and the Balkan War—during which her armies, finance and vital resources were strained to the pitch of ruin and destruction, leaving her in a paralyzed condition that affected her population as well as herself. No sooner had the soldier reached his home and commenced his daily work for the support of his half-starving family and himself, than he w r as called again to the ranks. A nation upon whose individuals such calamities have fallen is leading herself and her Government into a fate that needs no foretelling on our part, if she throws herself into the abyss of a new war of unprecedented size—the more so as her revenues consist in the taxes levied upon the incomes of those ill-fated individuals, whether commercial, industrial or agricultural. This is one of the reasons that made the sensible Moslems disapprove of the entry of the Turkish Government into the present war, and it is a reason supported by the actual internal condition of every country within the Empire. No. 250. My Lord,20 There are also external reasons connected with the party with which fl, 8 Unionist Government has sided against the other party that m plunged into t ,' s war. The Ottoman Government is a Moslem Government and her country extends far and wide with long sea coasts. The line of po ,cy which the Great Sultans of the family of Osman had followed in the past, was the keenin' of friendly relations with the Governments under whose rule the majority of Moslems live, and who up to this day have kept their supremacy on the seas. Therefore when the Unionists* Government declared war against these Governments in alliance with an arrogant and ambitious party who is out for conquest because of over-population in her country, all Moslems with any common sense and understanding foretold bad consequences and looked forth into a dark future. I was one of those who believed so and when I was asked by cable whar, mv opinion was, I replied according to what duty dictated to me. This I hold as a proof of my sincerity to this Government and my anxiety over its safety and the preservation of the Islamic Holy Places. Events now have justified our fears and the Government has reached the point which we had foretold. The boundaries of the Ottoman Empire are, now, in Europe quite near to the walls of Constantinople; the Russian army is carrying away the inhabitants of Sivas and Mosul, and the British army drives before It thousands of Ottoman prisoners in the desert of El Arsh, after bavins occupied the villayet of Basrah and a part of the villayet of Baghdad. Undoubtedly he who contemplates well the present situation and sees that the war is still raging, can without difficulty foresee the final result which will bo one of two things ; either to resign ourselves to this threatening danger until we are sw r ept olf the map of the world, or to try and extricate ourselves from it. We leave it to the whole world to consider this question and issue its reply. We have no doubt .^that the w’hole world justifies our revolt at the opportune moment before complete ruin sets in on the rest of the countries within the Empire taken by surprise. We do not falter in our belief that our revolt is legitimate and a duty for us to accomplish. Had we any idea that our keeping loyal to a Government which has become a puppet in the hands of others, would be of any use to her or would help her to retain her territories, we w r ould not have revolted, but would have kept patience and borne everything willingly; but how can we do so when we are certain that if we had resigned ourselves to the fate to which they were dragging us, we would have fallen hand in hand with them into the abyss of annihilation into which the other villayets are now falling. Yes, we say this and leave the judgment in it to the justice of the other w^orld ; and yet we cannot but express publicly the fact that the sole cause for the collapse of this Empire and the extermination of its remaining subjects, i.e. t the inhabitants of Asia Minor, is the change effected by the Unionists’ leaders—Enver, Jemal and Tala at—on the policy founded and followed previously by the Great Ottoman politicians, viz., the friendly attitude towards the two Great Powers, Great Britain and France, whose favours on Turkey none can deny unless he dis credits history. It is sufficient to show the amount of sincerity and faithful ness of the Unionists and their low character by hinting upon the fact that a short time after receiving the loan from Prance which the latter helped them with in theii dire need, they joined her enemies and declared war against her. We choose this action of hers from many others to show their character because it is of recent occurrence and known to everybody. Add to this the oppression wrought upon the inhabitants and the diversified atrocities committed upon them, Moslems and Christians alike, by those Government dictators and their followers duriu' this war of oppression upon the Greeks and Armenians contrary to the°dictates of our bacred Law. And then they did the same tiling with the Arabs in Syria, Mesopotamia and other districts, which is known to everybody, and ended with their cowardly action with the Awali Arab in the suburbs of Medina m that they captured Arab women and led them to the military barracks —deeds which the Islamic Law and Arab nobility condemn. Yes, we have revolted and we mean by our revolt the declaration of our euiLity and detestation to Eaver, Talaat, Jemai and their followers, and everyMoslem joins us in this, even members of the Osman family. The treach erous murder of Prince Yusef Izziddin is a proof that that noble family joins us. We liberate ourselves from them and declare our hostility to them, and every righteous Moslem in Turkey and elsewhere joins us in this because of the misery into which they have dragged the country, and the certain ruin into which they are launching the Islamic Government, by sacrificing it on the altar of their personal ambitions. We conjure God to help us against them, and are certain that this is the word of Right on which we live and die. 1]ow can we refrain from saying this while we have before us the record of so many calamities, which we are going to relate to our Moslem brethren so that they may know all. Jemal Pasha, the absolute ruler of Syria, has ordered the inhabitants to organise a Women’s Society and then intimated to this Society to make a reception for him. His orders were obeyed, and the Society actually made the reception which he and his men attended. In that reception the Moslem ladies—mem bers of the Society—waited upon their guests and, at the end, made speeches and sang songs in the midst of all that crowd of men, according to news published by Syrian newspapers which showed their admiration of them, and put praise upon them in order to please Jemal Pasha. May God be glorified. He who says in his book :— “ O Prophet—tell your wives and sisters, and the women of the faithful to veil themselves so that they may not be recognised and harmed.” And His saying also :—“ Tell your women to keep their eyes down, put their legs together, and shut out their beauty except from their husbands and relatives.” Prom this we can understand clearly the intentions of those aggressors with regard to the Islamic Law and the Arab customs. This is an example and a lesson to our brethren the Moslems of Turkey and of the other countries of the world, to wake them up and prevent them from complying with the wish of those tyrants in their violations of women’s honour, and from daring to disobey the word of God for the sake of fame or the salary which they are paid. He who disobeys God should not be obeyed, and he who has the power from the Almighty to stop this infamy with his hand, his tongue, or his heart, should do so, and he who has the means with which he can defy those aggressors for their daring, let him bring it forward, for we are, if God wills, of those that hear sayings and follow the good therein mentioned. 11 Zil Kaada 1334.

My Lord, In continuation of my despatch No. 248,1 have the honour to transmit to Your Lordship, herewith, copies of a despatch I have received from Colonel Wilson (No. 5, dated September 28th) reporting his movements subsequent to the interview with Faisal, and dealing with various matters connected with the Hedjaz, including the Phrench Mission and the arrival of the Mahmal at Mecca.Copies of his correspondence with the Sheriff and his sons are also enclosed. I am sending copy also to the Viceroy of India. I have the honour to be, with the highest respect. My Lord, Tour Lordship’s most obedient humble servant, H. McMahon. The Viscount Grey of Fallodon, K. G., &amp;c., &amp;o., &amp;c. Enclosure No. 2. (Secret.) ■ Jeddah; Despatch No. 6. 28th September 1916. Sir, I have the honour to report that I arrived at Jeddah on September 24th at 4 p.m. I reached Tanbo 21st September and left the same evening for Rabegh arriving there on 22nd September. I met Faisal Bey at Yanbo and learnt from him that his brother Ali Bey had arrived at Rabegh; it being obvious that the two brothers had no real plan of co-operation. I managed to persuade Faisal Bey to accompany me to Rabegh to consult his brother and come to some definite agreement. On arriving at Rabegh, Ali Bey, Zeid Bey v recent ly arrived from Medina) and Nuri Bey came on board ; shortly afterwards Aziz Bey El Masri arrived and joined the conference with the above, which I purposely did not attend. The conference lasted from 9*30 a. m. to 2-30 P. M., during most of which time Zeid Bey was not allowed to be present. After the conference, Ali and Faisal saw me privately and told me the decision come to, etc., after which Faisal returned to Yanbo in H. M. S. “ Northbrook ” by courtesy of Captain Boyle, R. N., S. N. O. On the 22nd I landed with Captain Boyle, R. N., and the two Naval Flying Corps officers who were on board H. M. S. “ Dufierin ”, to ascertain if a suitable site for an aeroplane camp could be found. I informed Your Excellency by telegram, No. 1930, of September 22nd of the result. I had a private talk with Aziz Bey and went over the morning’s decision with him; the various requests he made were telegraphed to Your Excellency (my 6215 of September 22nd). The Defence Scheme for Rabegh consists of an entrenched position north west-west and north-east of the village and palm grove, it is 6,500—8,000 yards from the anchorage and guards the water-supply and is astride of the Sultani Road. The telephone wire, &amp;e., asked for is to connect three fortified posts with a central reserve in the rear and another line to the aeroplane camp and ships. The entrenching tools are urgently required, as are also the quick-firing guns, as Ali Bey has only three guns including one of those recently captured from the Turks. J * I gave Ali Bey the five Colt and the remaining five German maxims (two of the latter 1 gave haisal); 2,500 rifles for himself and 1,000 for Faisal, The general idea in case of a Turkish advance down the Sultani Roid was given in my telegram 6216 of 22nd September to Your Excellency. 1 he places named with the exception of Makhshash—are I think marked on the plan I produced at the Ismuilia conference, w hich the General OfficerS3 CommruHlinsr CommnmW-in-Chief, retained and promised to forward copies which Your Excellency has probably received. P The patrol ships guard the flanks of the Arab position and if three quick- firing batteries complete are sent (Nuri Bey assured me he could And personnel for their,) the Arabs should be able to hold their own if they keep a good heart and really fight; on the other hand, they may get a knock and give up the struggle, the fall of Taif has had an excellent effect and the morale of the Arabs generally is certainly improved since I first saw Eaisal. I left Captain Bray, 18th Bengal Lancers, at Rabegh as my representative, where be will be most useful as a liason officer between AH and the RFC Detachment, and in many other ways. I hope that Your Excellency will obtain permission for this officer to remain at my disposal for a month or so at least, he is very keen on the work and is just the type of officer I require. Aziz Bey and Nuri Bey particularly ask that the following officers be sent as soon as possible :— Said Mahmud.—An artillery officer with the Sultan of Maskat. Aziz Bey asks that a letter may be sent to the Sultan asking for the loan of this officer’s services for a few months, together with any of his friends, who would all return after a few months. Yazbashi Rashid i Mulazim These two officers were prisoners in India, and according to Aziz Bey did not come to Jeddah with the Arab prisoners from Egypt last month owing to a misunderstanding, but are both quite trustworthy and keen to come. Gaafar Pasha.—Az\z Bey is very anxious for him to come, which former (?) thinks he would like to and states that Gaafar Pasha would be absolutely loyal to the Sheriff. If he comes, Aziz wishes him to be given a chance of talking to the Arab prisoners as several may be willing to come and serve with Gaafar Pasha. Taif .—I gather from Aziz Bey, and the Egyptian officers now with Eaisal who came from Taif, that the Sheriff and the conduct of the Arabs are the reasons of the long delay. The Sheriff wished to capture the place without bloodshed or destruction of houses and the Arabs could not be got to make an assault. I am glad to say that I do not consider that blame attaches to Said Pasha Ali for the lengthy operations. Wedj .—Sheikh Saad Ghoneim of the Goheina was to leave Yanho on 22nd instant with 1,200 camelry to raid the Billi country which he will probably do thoroughly. Turkish Dispositions .—From several talks with Nuri Bey I gather that the total force under Fakri Pasha amounts to about 15,000 men distributed as follows:— (1) On the Faree and Ghayer Roads from Bir El Nasni to El Nafa: 1 Regiment. 2 Mountain guns. 4 Machine guns. (2) Medina and immediate neighbourhood: same as 1, with a certain number of old field guns in forts. (3) Bir El Dervish (Sultani Road force) : A full division (3 regiments). 4 Mountain Quick-Firing Batteries of recent make. 7 Field guns (fairly modern). 12 Machine guns. 1 Squadron Cavalry. 1 Company Camel Corps (about 500 strong).ii 24 The regiments have been brought up to full strength (3,^00) by gendar merie Arabs and scallywags. Regular Army probably 60 per cent. The morale of the force is not good, supplies are short, and transport increasingly difficult for the enemy to obtain. The Turkish communications are daily harassed by Arab parties, many of whom do not belong to the Sheriff’s forces but are working on their own. Nuri Bey obtained this information re the Turkish force from the Arab officers who recently deserted from the enemy. Turkish Mahmal. —Nuri Bey does not think the Mahmal has arrived at Medina ; its special escort reached there about 2nd September, or earlier, which possibly accounts for the report that it had actually arrived ; if it arrives, Ali Bey proposes to offer to take it over and guarantee its safety to Mecca. Ibn Sand—Six hundred of his men have been some weeks with Ali Bey. I could obtain no confirmation of the report that Ibn Rashid had sent a force to attack the Harb. Medina Railway.— Bey informed me that 3,000 Goheina are now north of Medina near the railway, between Rewat (?) and Hadiyah, to prevent any Turkish force coming to Yanbo by a road from Rewat (?) which runs north of the Sultani Road. Sheikh Assaaf (who went to Suez for instruction in the use of explosives) and his men will work with the above force, and has been instructed to endeavour to destroy the railway engines. I handed over the gelignite, etc., to Sheikh Assaaf at Yanbo and he now has everything he requires. General. —One of the two Turkish guns sent on H. M. S. “ Dufferin ” had no elevating wheel. Nuri Bey is only taking one with the spare parts of the other, as the ammunition available is not enough for the two. The second gun will be taken to Suez by H. M. S. “ Dufiferin ” for delivery to the General Officer Commanding, Commander-in-Chief, who, I think, expressed a wish to have them back, if possible. The full discussion between Ali and Faisal and the opportune presence of Aziz Bey has, I think, done a lot of good and cleared the air. Hussein of Rabegh. —Left Rabegh when he heard that Ali Bey was approaching. He has written letters to the latter to say that he cannot come into Rabegh, but that, if the Turks advance, he will attack them. Ali Bey has now refused to have anything more to do with him, until Hussein goes to Mecca and sees the Sheriff. His action in running away alter taking the oath of loyalty, instead of fighting Said Bey, has done much to discredit him. Arabs desert him daily and a nephew of his, who is in Ali’s camp with about 800 of the tribe, will probably be appointed Sheikh in Hussein’s place, if he proves himself loyal to the Sheriff. French Mission. —The Mission had an excellent reception on their arrival at Jeddah which included two public dinners of 88 (?) covers. Aziz Bey appears to be somew hat concerned as to the object of the Mission. I told him it was an act of courtesy to the Sheriff on behalf of our ally. He also volunteered the information that after the fall of Medina he and Abdulla Bey would go to Egypt, endeavour to have a secret meeting with Your Excellency on the subject of Syria and French arms there, with the idea of making a secret treaty between the British Government and the Sheriff, after which he wxmld return to Mecca. The fact of his going to Egypt was to be a deep secret. After remarking that it would be better to wait until Medina was captured before making any plans, I changed the subject. In addition to Colonel Bremond and his two officers, M. de Wettel (French Consul at Jeddah up to the outbreak of war) is also of the party. He informed me that he was here in an unofficial capacity only, but I would have preferred his absence at the present time.25 fh Colonel Bremond informed me that the Mission had an excellent reception at Mecca ; he and his staff (which is I hear to be considerably augmented) are occupying the French Consulate, which, of course, flies the Tricolor.

The Emir particularly expressed his grateful thanks and appreciation for all the arrangements made on board and the treatment he and the escort had received from Commander Linberry, U. N.. commanding H. M. S. “ Hardinge ° His Excellency the Admiral Commander-in-Chief with his staff came ashore before the Mahmal to assist in its reception. On the morning of the 27th, the Admiral Commander-in-Chief and his staff came ashore to call on Sheriff Mohsen Ibn Mansur (the Sheriff’s represent ative) who met His Excellency on landing. The shoie battery fired a salute and two guards of honour (new levies and police) were paraded to receive His Excellency. A procession was formed to the Government officer (sic) and from there His Excellency proceeded to the French Consulate and visited the British Consu late before returning to the flagship. In the afternoon at the invitation of His Excellency, the Sheriff Mohsen and various notables came off to the flagship and were shown the guns, &amp;c., hy His Excellency himself. They were very greatly impressed. It is difficult for me to adequately express the excellent effect of His Excellency’s visit which has made a very great impression and will be of immense assistance to me, especially after the reception accorded the French Mission, the effect of which has now been entirely eclipsed. The fact that in the first year of the new regime, the Mahmal was brought in one of H. M. ships and saluted in the harbour by three British warships, coupled with the presence of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, has not been missed by leading people of Jeddah and has caused genuine satisfaction. I am both glad and relieved to hear from Colonel Parker that he remains at Rabegh. The stain of trying to deal wffth the Arab military operations from Jeddah as well as with the very numerous other matters with only two Civil British Assistants, has been very great. 1 1 return to Jeddah on the 30th, and shall report on the result of the visit to Rabegh with His Excellency the Admiral Commander-in-Chief as soon as possible, meanwhile Mr. Storrs, will be able to give Your Excellency the result personally in a lew days, as I understand he returns direct to Suez from Rabegh.

Just after finishing my letter to you, I have received the enclosed letters from Hussein Ibn Mebarik which are sufficient for you to peruse. I gathered from them that suspicion related to him does not exist at all and if anything that you should go to Eabegh to prevent any danger which may appear in ease of rebel. The way will be smoothed. The communication will be safe and the result desired by Faisal will take place. Consequently yon should proceed to Rabegh with the blessing of God. This is indeed a si’'n of prosperity. ° If possible, you can give a letter to Hussein Ruhi to inform him all about the matter telling him that he may come to meet you at Rabegh for the purpose of salutation, and that he may stay one day or two with °you there. If he has some work to do he can go and come back to you. This is what I thought satisfactory and no better opinion than that. Try to let Beni Bishr and Beni Hussein to avoid such mendacity and other things that may happen. Read this letter to Muhammad Ibn Hamaadi warning against such things, and tell him that such this {sic) must be of the elusion of Bishr. Write a letter to Hmssein Ruhi and leave it with a special man whom Ahmed or El Sayid may choose, and he is to wait at the harbour. You can tell him the matter is prosperous without fighting, and that there must be a ship to frighten the people. Be very careful in this matter and write to your brother Faisal, either by wireless or by a special messenger that you have occupied Rabegh and that you are there with your troops. Tell Hussein Ruhi to send you the gun with its men, ammunition and mules which we had sent to Yanbo with the troops and to bring you also the- guns which were sent to Suez for repair. Faisal shall have other guns. His Highness the Sheriff of Mecca, After Salaams, fyc., 8fc .—I have just had the pleasure of meeting your son Zeid Bey and had a talk with him about Rabegh. I am taking 400 or 500 men there to-morrow and Zeid Bey is sending a chief man with them. I understand from Zeid Bey that the majority of his force remains here at Quadima. I have told him that at least 2,000 men of Your Highness’s Army should be at Rabegh and Faisal Rey was very insistent on this which is most important. I would strongly recommend that Your Highness sends orders as soon as possible to your son Zeid Bey that 2,000 men must be at Rabegh and not at Quadima. Rabegh must be strongly occupied by Your Highness’s troops. This is most important for your son Faisal Bey and for your cause. I trust, therefore, Your Highness will give the necessary orders.

Excellency, All the operations which you have made from the beginning of the battle were strategically necessary, as I explained in my former message which 1 for- warded a week ago His Highness the Grand Sheriff of Mecca through Your Excellency, and it is useless to continue the defence and shedding blood after we have understood your real aims and intentions and we have begged the solving of this problem and settling the result of this war according to the principles of humanity and Muhammadanism. Our aims in begging you to send us with our arms to Medina was that you may show to the civilised nations of the world an example of the high principles of Islam. In consequence of this, and as there are no provisions and ammunition, to avoid the shedding of blood, I prefer to leave off the quarrel and to stop continuing the war. If it suits Your Excellency, I will send to you representatives to make the agreements, or you may send us representatives from your side.

The arrival of the above will he about ten days from date. I think it is necessary to send the guns coming from Suez to Faisal as soon as possible, because their arrival there will create a rumour which will be a good means of contending with so many important and unexpected events. I must emphasize to His Excellency the British Agent that I did not, in the beginning, accept more than two guns from each battery on their arrival at Jeddah, which 1 thought better, but you refused to separate them from the batteries showing that it was impossible. Now I wish it to be understood that, if there was any objection whatever in sending the guns from Taif, it was for the above mentioned reasons only. The guns will arrive in the time given above, by the tvill of God. His Highness the Sheriff and Emir of Mecca, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Your Highness’s telegram of yesterday by which I am delighted to see that Your Highness has issued orders for two mule guns and two Maxim guns to be sent here from Taif at once and that they will arrive in about ten days’ time. I am sure this is the best course to follow and they will be of the greatest possible use to your son Faisal Bey. When the two guns arrive from Suez, I will send Bomb. (?) Zeki Effendi with them and one howitzer from here to llabegh as soon as there is a ship to take them.

TRANSLATION. (Amibate of Mecca the respected.) No. In the name of the compassionate and merciful God, To the Gallant and Vigorous Amir Abdul-Aziz Pasha Bin Abd-er-Rahman Al-Saood, (May God save him). May salams and the mercy of God and Bis blessings rest on you.—It is not hidden from you that the time-honoured designs of Sheriff Hussein Bin Ali Oni have had this result, viz., they have displeased the faithful and all Moslems and those who obey the Prophet, and have resulted in his actually joining the enemy of religion and of the Kingdom of the Moslem Caliphate at a time when the Amir-ul-Moomanin ordered all Moslems to declare the sacred jehad against the Powers fighting against our Moslem Kingdom. Instead of doing his share of jehad in this universal war, the said Sheriff Hussein, availing himself of the opportunity of the Government being busied in protecting the Ottoman Dominions and defending the rights of all Moslems, revolted against the Sultan, and, declaring his time-honoured evil designs, actually joined the British Government, which is in hostilities with our Kingdom, and brought the enemy to Jeddah and Yanbo-el-Bahr, and allowed them to enter into the pure and sacred lands, and has permitted the blood shed of innocent Moslems in the peaceful towns without fearing God, or think ing of the evil consequences which will recoil on him and his defeated followers. And whereas both he and his sons attempted to seduce some of the humble-minded simple Shaikhs by false promises and by the small sums of money which he distributes from the funds of the British and so leads them to loss and destruction, it became necessary to dismiss him, so that things might be restored to their proper owners. The Amirate of Mecca the respected has, therefore, been assigned to me. Depending on him who does not fail to answer our hopes and to provide us with the spirituality of our ancestor, our Lord the Prophet of God, we, all Moslems and the inhabitants of the pure and peaceful town {i.e., Medina) have determined to conduct hand in hand with our Moslem Kingdom and her eternal and victorious soldiers the greatest of jehad to disinfect the Qibla from this sin. We cannot believe that the Arab Chieftains will tolerate this disloyalty on part of Hussein, which he is worthy to be stained by, and which will form a black page both for him and all like him, in the history of Islam and which will cause their defeat in this world and the world to come, apart from the terrible sufferings he will have to bear. No doubt that all Moslems, especially the wise and religious Arab Chiefs will free themselves from, and reject with all their force, this great disgrace, and will sacrifice themselves in defending with their Moslem Government, their Qibla, which is the Qibla of all who admit of God’s unity ; so that they may gain the victory in the Most Terrible Day. Therefore we inform you of the event, for the sake of avoiding ambiguity, and we call upon you to perform your religious duty towards your Qibla.84 And to you is sent a copy* containing an explanation of the same affair • Sheriff Haidar'e proclsmation already published which after yOtt haVe inspected and read in buiietmf through, its contents will be appreciated p. z. Cox. ky y 0U&lt; I am confident that those who respect their religion and possess a particle of soundness of mind, will defend the Qibla of all Moslems with his life, money and sons, and will purge it from sin and from infidels, so that infidels may retreat with loss. Therefore you, 0 Amir, need no more explanations : No doubt that you are one of those who appreciate matters. We pray God the Most High to enable us all to bring victory for our religion, and to protect the two Holy Places. We are, therefore, expecting soon after the arrival of this our letter that you will very promptly take satisfactory measures. May God guide and help us all. And salams are the best conclusions.

On their letuin after the skirmish that took place between them and the sons ot the Sheiiff, the iurks attacked Awali (a town near Mbdina which has considerable date gardens belonging to a tribe called the Beni Ali who had been siding with the sons of the Sheriff in revolt against the Turks) and bombarded the town, plundered it, outraged the people and perpetrated iniquit ies upon them. A Sheriff has now been created at Constantinople, who is named Hvdar. They claim that he is a new Amir for Mecca. There arrived with him a deputation and some troops and on their arrival at Medina they committed barbarous acts against the townspeople, imprisoning and hanging them. No one who possesses zeal for Islam and Arab patriotism can tolerate such things. This is the latest news received from Medina. At this moment, while writing, I have received news that on account of what the Turks perpetrated at Awali and against the townsmen of Medina, the Harb (Beni Salim) and the A1 Fahdah, who had previously sided with the Turks, came to an understanding with the Masruh who are co-operatin^ with the sons of the Sheriff, and all of them joined forces and became one. They ambushed the Turks and cut their communications in and out of Medina, on account of the Turks’ brutal proceedings. My informant also alleges that the Harb sent to the sons of the Sheriff asking them to advance towards Medina and the surrounding places with a view to cutting communications with the town and destroying the railway. This is the news which reaches me while writing, hut God knows whether it is true. Inshallah, I shall inform you when it is confirmed. According to what we learn about the doings of the Turks, their oppression and tyranny of anyone wtio comes within their reach is such that it is clear and certain that they whll never set their affairs aright and will never succeed. Then Your Honour spoke to me regarding Bin Rashid. I have just heard news of his arrival at his dwelling place—Hail. Thank God he is certainly in evil plight. With reference to your hope that you would hear soon about the doings of my men in that direction, I have explained to Your Honour in my previous letter the primary difficulty. Now I beg to inform you that the difficulty in tne way of attacking Bin Rashid in the neighbourhood of Hail at present is not due to any strength in him which prevents it, nor to any weak ness in me or my forces, but it arises from political reasons which make it inexpedient to force hostilities on them at present. But whether it be a question of fighting with Bin Rashid or other Arabs in enmity with the British Government, or of co-operation and assistance to people like the Sheriff (problems concerning us in our dealings with one another and affected by our individual views and interests) it is evident and well-known to Your Honour that none of us will let an opportunity pass which will benefit us against the enemy, and that the reason for abstention from action is that we are watching for such an opportunity as, please God, will secure a successful issue. If, however, the case is otherwise, and if you discern in the matter anything con ducive to my interests and yours, there is no doubt that I will not, Inshallah, deviate from your opinion or your point of view alter consultation between us, either in writing or by confidential messenger, or there might be a meeting between me and Your Honour at any place you please, so that we could exchange views on the subject. That is what I should like best, for there are necessarily many matters in one’s mind wdiich affect the interests of both parties. If you so order it and if you think it advisable that we should have a meeting, you must uive me sufficient notice to enable a meeting to be arranged. 1 wall await a reply to this letter and the receipt of your instructions. Inshallah, you will inform me of good and gratifying news of the victories of the Great Government in Iraq and elsewhere. It is ever our hope that your friendship with me will be perpetual. In conclusion, I wish you good health and prosperity.. 37 Telegram TL, No. 5558, dated the 29th freceived 30th) October 1916.

It appears from note books found on two parties of Germans attacked by Arabs in Hedjaz last May which were sent to us by Sheriff, and other informa tion, that Turkish and German General Staffs decided in January last to use Yemen and Hedjaz coasts as bases of operations against us. An Ottoman Expeditionary Force under Kheiri Bey and Baron Yon Stotzingen left Constantinople and arrived at Medina in May for this purpose. They planned to advance to Sanaa by Mecca, Kunfida and Ibha, avoiding Idrisi country in Yemen. Their intention was to threaten Aden, organise attempts at destruc tion of British commerce and stir up rebellion on African coast, Somaliland Protectorate and Abyssinia through raiding parties and agents. It was arrival of this force that compelled Sheriff in self defence to icvolt sooner than he had intended. By his action we have undoubtedly been ^ saved from serious trouble, especially in view of previously prepared situation in Somaliland Protectorate and Abyssinia. Should Germans and Turks succeed in regaining Hedjaz they will resume these attempts at the same time and this is another cogent military reason for giving Sheriff all assistance in our power.

Present crisis can hardly continue for more than two or three weeks and I am afraid that it is unlikely that any assistance that 1 rench Government can give can arrive in time to be of use. Temporary increase in number of warships on Hedjaz coast is being arranged by Naval Commander-in-Chief, and if need arises their assistance mav be of vital importance in preventing lurks advancing along coast to Rabegh should they break through hills, and in encouraging Arabs. Main essential is to keep up spirit of Arabs, and it is for this reason that I still urge sending flight or even half flight of aeroplanes which Sheriff so uAently requests if aeroplanes are available, I am confident we can find safe basl on coast on which their use would be conditional. Moral effect of seaplanes now there is reported to be very great, but their range is very email.

Bin Saud, subject to this, should be encouraged as you propose in every possible way to unite with Sheriff in his own interests and that of other Chiefs referred to. As we could not admit Article 2 as bind* ing us against other Arabs treaty should be confined to Article 1. It may be explained, if necessary, that His Majesty’s Government have no reason to suppose that Sheriff has any designs on Bin Sand’s territory and that they, of course, consider themselves bound to use their good offices in latter’s behalf so long as he keeps treaty. We are considering question of communicating treaty to Sheriff. 152 [Received with memorandum from the Chief Political Officer, Basrah, to the Officer in Charge, Cairo Section, Eastern Bureau, No. 44, dated September 1918.] [Copy forwarded to Director, Eastern Bureau, Eoreign Secretary, Political Secretary, India Office and Chief of the General Staff, Indian Expeditionarv Eorce “ D ”, Basrah.] ^ Translation of a letter from Abd El-Aziz Ibn Abd Er-Eahman Al-Faisal, to His Honour Sir Percy Cox, His Majesty's Consul-General in the Persian Gulf, dated the 20th July 1916.

I appealed longer of any importance. ^ P aie now annihilated and are no there is no doubter the ^pe^n^ l^ maintain his P osi tion secure at Hail, enemy. He w^as probablv cne of G ^ ^° U ^ n f° rir iation was an sent to you, hopW thL bv v.ln. of Ibn Rashid whom they proximity to you thev mieht fill v° e }J ac ti vl ties on your side and their might accept his demands^ But thnnb apprelieilsion 80 tllat you and Ibn Rashid became of n^impartance^in^ 0 ^ the . r ^7 erse of this happened before. And it is plain that Ynnf £ y ° Ur as I told you trivality of his following and oDhis pewonalitv ^ a PP rcciat(id ,he m your letter. ^ ona t 1 ty for you have recorded them97 With iTicrencc to A1 Abd and Hail, I sent against them my son Turki and baisal ibn llashid with an adequate force, and ever since you and I parted at -katif up to now they have been investing Hail and interrupting its “musabilah ^Supply communications.) There is but a small number of deseit^ Arab in Hail, but the fact that we were not able to force an entrance into the town is due, firstly, to the reason that the terrain between Kasim and Hail is barren ground where there is no vegetation for camels to eat (and jou know well that nothing can be done by Arabs without their camels); and secondly, because the tow n is fortified and it was not possible to make a successful assault in the absence of effecetive weapons. We had only our original guns which, as I have told you are only light ones; and more over, we had not enough ammunition to enable us to enter into prolonged fighting with Ibn Rashid and into war with the Turks generally. (ii) I beg to inform you that you have fulfilled my demands and sent me what was necessary. \ ou have done what was required and I am thankful and obliged to Your Honours. (iii) I ^g to acknowledge also the receipt of the letter of His Excel lency the Viceroy and was very glad to receive it. (iv) I confirm what I told you regarding the export of goods to hostile countries and note that you have made energetic arrangements in that connec tion. As I said before, the system you have established is no doubt very good. (v) I note also that you have despatched the Treaty to His Excellency the Viceroy for signature and I am thankful and obliged. (vi) With regard to my relative Ahmad Ibn Abdulla A1 Thanaiyan I note that you have, soon after the receipt of my information, sent for him, and that he came to you. I note also that you have found nothing in his papers to prove him guilty, but have arranged for his departure for Maskat, w here he w as to be under detention until you heard fiom me and learnt what my wishes were as to his furure disposal. As I told you previously I had formerly trusted him but he gave me no intimation regaiding his departure, and told me nothing until ultimately he wrote to me a letter which I sent to you together with the Treaty, flis having thus left without reason and without any warning caused me to suspect him, for you are aware of the nature of the present time and of the people nowadays. You are well aware, too, that people do many things which are contrary to their own interests and I w r as afraid that he might do things of which we should disapprove and which you would not consider justified on the part of one who is committed with me. I thought it best to explain the facts to you so that in the event of his being guilty of any misconduct, I might escape any odium due to the fact of its having been consulted by one of our pepople. We have no fear, nor would any one fear, that any serious evil would result to him from his being arrested by Government in connection with his departure without warning and without prudence, for the fact is that Great Britain and yourself are more kind to our people than we are ourselves in such matters. But the truth is that Ibn Thanaiyan has a family in our neighbourhood and they came to my father’s house and begged him to ask me to write to Your Honour to request you kindly to send him back ; and my father has asked me to do this. If he returns, Ibn Thanaiyan shall live in my father’s house with him, at the capital, Riyadh. X beg you. therefore to send him back to Bahrein and to instruct His Majesty’s Consul there to send him to Ojair or to Katif and thence to Hassa soon after his arrival at Bahrein. Believe me I did not write to you about him for any personal reasons. I only wanted to safeguard our own good name and to ensure that nothing should happen from one of our people which might be opposed .to the interests of our friend Great Britain. (vii) With regard to Ibn Rashid and his correspondence with Shaikh Ibrahim and your relations with him I endorse what Your Honour said, w nc is, that ail are agreed that he is an ignorant and foolhardy youth. As you remarked, his following only amounts to 20U or oOO men. Nevertheless, ns remaining in the Shamieh is not expedient, i our policy and correspondence98 vitli reference to him nppcftrs to me to li&amp;ve been quite oppropi inte, but there is no doubt that Ibn Rashid is unable to appreciate and recognise it. He is absolutely unable to guide his own footsteps, much less lead the desert Arabs and people of that kind. By his remaining in your neighbourhood and by showing plenty of activity, he evidently thought that he would secure one of two things: either that you would comply with his demands (but that was impossible for owing to your diplomacy and capability you understand his position as you do that of others) or that he would receive some benefits from the Turks. * And all the arrangements of the Turks with him have been badly managed. They complied with his wants to some extent but it would seem that they have given him up as a bad job owing to his previous conduct and the way in which he has trifled with them. 1 &lt;july received the telegaphic news Your Honour sent to Abd el Latif el Maindil to Bahrein informing him that your cavalry with the Hhafir and Ibn Tuwalla had attacked and defeated Ibn Rashid. I was very glad to get the news and hope to receive confirmation of it. I pray God that whatever' is useful in the interests of Government may happen. (viii) And you have mentioned also that Ibn Tuwalla visited you two days ago and that it is hoped that he wull act in co-operation with the Hhafir. You also remark that he has informed you regarding the operations of my son Turki and Eaisal Al-Obayyed against Hail and its vicinity. You say that Ibn Tuw r alla hopes to unite with the tribes which adjoin him and that you expect that I will tell him that he may reckon on my support. Regarding Turki, I have informed you about him and please God, ho will rise to his duties completely. As regards Ibn Tuwalla and my assurance to him, I at once wrote him a letter, which I enclose herewith for Your Honour to see. If it meets with your approval kindly send it on to him. There is no doubt that if Tuwalla opposes Ibn Rashid, we shall draw closer to him in our relations and shall help him in all circumstances. Ibn Tuwalla and the Aslam tribe used to be under our aegis of old and even Ibn Rashid himself. Inshallah the old state of things will be restored. (ix) Yon have informed me about the course of the struggle in the European theatres of war and told me how tbe Germans are sullering from lack of ammunition and provisions, and how their expectations are being disappointed and that they are suffering heavy losses. We pray to God to disappoint their hopes. Our friend Great Britain and her allies will, with God’s help and protection, gain the victory over them. This is what is ’ to be hoped for, because w^e believed that tbe Germans and their allies have no other intention than to oppress and over-tax the world, just as thev have done in Syria and Baghdad and Constantinople. Without doubt people whose first deeds are of this kind will fail in their objects. (x) Ihen you spoke of the situation on tbe Tigris and at Baghdad and mentioned that the Russian Cavalry were moving in that vicinity wmilst your own victorious Armies on the Tigris were in contact with the Turks some o mi es 10 m Kut, and that you are awaiting a more favourable season. nsia^ai, tns will come soon and we shall receive the news of your victory over them as w r e hope.

I do not doubt that this is a wise measure and fortiie facility of the public. It is a proof of the good policy of the British Gov ernment towards her subjects and all of those who are under her patronage. (xiv) Your honour expressed doubt as to whether I should not be inconvenienced by reading your long letter. On the contrary I was glad of it and gained from it much knowledge of the things connected with me and my all airs and of the progress of the war. when I receive plenty of news from you I enjoy peace of mind and can safeguard myself in regard to numerous interested people : so please let your letters be long, as they are a source ot pleasure and utility to me. J (xy) I was glad to receive the news regarding the Sheriff of Mecca and to receive it officially from you. You thought I might already have got the news, but in any case your communication is the one on which I sliould depend I am in truth very much please at what has happened, firstly, as it is a knock out blow for the lurks, and secondly, because I do not wish any Turk to remain or to exist in Arabia. Inshallah, this event will be propitious also for my Iriend Great Britain. As soon as I was certain of the accuracy of the Sheriff’s news, and even before your letter reached me, I had the intention to write to Your Honour regarding my position and circumstances vis-a-vis the Sheriff and also regard ing the questions which effect you in this connection. I feel it incumbent on me to state to you (though you are much better informed in regard to the affair than I am), that my fear is that the Sheriff may obtain from the British Government an undertaking for his independent control over the Hedjaz and the Arabs. Although you yourself probably appreciate my fears, it is possible that the representative of the British Government who is actually conducting negotiations with the Sheriff, is not acquainted with the position. As you are aware there has been war between me and the Sheriff for years and his design has always been to get a footing in Nejd and the neighbourhood, both among Bedouins and the townspeople. In fact he has not failed to interfere in these directions and the Turks were assisting him in his proceedings and providing him with the necessary means. It is essentials, therefore, that Your Honour should draw the attention of Government to the fact that the boundaries between Nejd and the Hedjaz are well-defined and that the tribes of Nejd cannot come under the sway of any one. We cannot put up with or tolerate such an idea as I have previously explained to you. For is not Nejd the land of our forefathers ? Moreover Mecca has never from the earliest times, up to now had an independent chief ; but it has been an Amirate under the Turkish Government. What has prompted me to emphasize this to you is that I notice in the official communique that mention is made of “ the Arabs ” as if they were a compendious whole. It was incumbent on me to explain to you my views ou this point. Furthermore, the Sheriff in his dealings with you is not free from political guile and knows well how to turn phrases. He is no doubt exaggerating matters. What he wants is to obtain sup port from you or else that you should exert yourselves with him in attaining this end. I have therefore informed you so that in the event of your agreeing with me you may communicate to the Great Britain Government what I have said in case my views should commend themselves to them. If, however, you do not think as I do never mind; I do not very much care if the Sheriff does obtain his independence in this way. But the real point is that the Turkish Government supplied him with ammunition, arms and money, and he was leading them to hope that he would do great things for them in Syria; but when he got all he wanted from them he rose and declared bis independence; his motive being thereby to put the Turks in difficulties with the British Government and so obtain from them his independence, guaranteed by the German Government. And what your friend deduces from the facts is that the Sheriff is not dow in any danger from the Turks. The Sheriff’s position depends upon the people of the Hedjaz, that is ou the Bedouins. If they support him, he will100 not be in any danger from the Turks, but if they abandon him and side w.tb the Turks, then the position of the Sheriff in the Uedjaz wnl be worth noth,ng. What I apprehend is that if the Turks see that the Bntish are helping the Sheriff they will grant him his independence at once and remain at rest in regard to him, but will turn their attention to him agam hereafter. My advice is that you should help the Sheriff but only to a partial extent, so that the Turks may still cherish hopes of crushing him and he also may remain in fear of the Turks. Thus the Turks will be greatly embarrassed in the Hediaz and this will be an assistance to your business in Iraq and elsewhere. In short, as far as I can see, the protraction of the hostilities between the Sheriff and the Turks is a most expedient course for you. My hope is that you will take these remarks into deliberate consideration. What you see, in my opinions, deserving of approval do as you think best in regard thereto and what you do not approve of, bear with merely as an expression of advice; for according to my lights, your interests are mine. As regards my son Turki and his movements, nothing has been happen ing lately; but we have decided if all goes well, to join him alter llamzan and consolidate our operations. We may operate either in the vicinity of Hail or in the locality where Ibn Rashid is to be found, hut nothing can be said definitely at the moment owing to the uncertainty of the movements of the Arabs. May God guide our steps in the right directions. I beg of you to let me know news of victories of our friend Great Britain. I have indeed trespassed upon you with my long discussion, but of course my confidence in and intimacy with you has permitted me to do this. I beg you to keep me informed as may be necessary. 153 [Received with memorandum from the Chief Political Officer, Basrah, to the Officer in Charge, Cairo Section, Eastern Bureau, No. 48, dated the 8th September 1916.] [Copy forwarded to the Director, Eastern Bureau, Eoreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Eoreign and Political Department, Political Secretary, India Office, Chief of the General Staff, Indian Expeditionary Poree “ D ”, Basrah.] In the name of God the Merciful. From Abdul Aziz Ibn Abdur Rahman al Faisal to the Chief Political Officer, dated the 15th August 1916. After compliments .—I despatched a letter to Your Honour recently; Inshallah you duly received it and it found you in the best of health. It is some little time since I received any letter from Your Honour communicating to me the good news of your victories over the evil does. I am always waiting for your good news in that connection. After writing my previous letter to you, I received from the Sheriff of Mecca letters conveying the good netvs of his occupation of Mecca with the assist ance of your guns. He asked me to render him assistance and to unite myself with him. 1 have written back saying that as regards assistance I will not fail to render it to the utmost of my power. As to union with him I have remarked that I have no designs on his country, i e., the Hedjaz and its surroundings : whereas, on the other hand, he, in the past, has been in the habit of interfer ing with my tribes and my territory, alleging that this has been done at the instance of the lurks and that it was they who were prompting him to do so*101 i 1 conjpndpd thai if 1,6 meant to 1)6 sinecre and desired t° be united with me and that vie should work hand in band, he should give me an undertakino- and a solemn promise for the immunity of my territories and my subjects! and foi abstention from trespassing in our limits or from interference with our subjects. It his reply is in the affirmative and he acts loyally no effort on my part will, pleasd God, be spared to help him to the best of my ability. ,, ^ ^ oti .!f v? r ^P'ymg as above is not due to any desire on mv part to allymyselfiiitli him, for you are aware of his previous relations with me: but it was due firstly, to the fact of my alliance with yourselves, and secondly lo Tjifir 1 ° £ th « Tu ^' 1 am anx . iOTS t0 fitter anything that may assist to e pel t em. So, it he answers in the affirmative and assures me that he has no aim other than real friendship, well and good. If he is seekin' to impose on me so that he may achieve his own independence and render himself free to start his old interference with me, then, if the matter is merely one between him and me, 1 shall look after myself to the best of mv ability. JBut if, on the contrary, the matter concerns your Great Government, I should in that case, like to do whatever is convenient to you, I have therefore referred the matter to you. In any case the Sheriff’s boundaries and territories are well known; and a further reference will be made to you, Inshallah, when I receive his reply. ^ I also have to inform your honour that I have recently learnt that the Ajman, who was lately witii Ibn Has hid iu the neighbourhood of Zubeir had on account of the peace between Ibn Rashid and Ibn Subah, come to an undeistanding with both those Chiefs, soon after the departure of Ibn Rashid liom that neighbourhood and his contact with Ibn Tnwalla and Ibn Swait, to the effect that they should settle in the territories of Ibn Subah. Ibis is not as it should be. I have explained to your honour re o, ardino’ the Ajman and their attitude towards me. They are outlaw subjects of mine and the reason of their contumacy was their support by Iba Subah and their stay at Kuwait, and this will certainly cause friction between me and Ibn Subah, for my subjects are bound to pursue the feud with the Aiman and so am I. I have also sent my represgntative, Abdul Aziz al Rabai, with letters to Ibn Subah and have made the necessary communication to him reo-ardin^ matters at issue between him and me. I have also instructed my represent” ative, aforesaid, that if Ibn Subah responds to our advice and complies with ray wishes so much the more gratifying will it be to me, and I shall regard them as the best of friends and fellow-tiibesmen. If, however, he rejects°mv advice, my messenger has been instructed to refer to your Consul at Kuwait*; and then, if possible, he will proceed to Basrah to lay the matters before you! But in truth I have said more than enough on this subject. You will understand that did matters conncern him and me alone, we should come to issue in regard to differences of less importance than this; but as your Government is also interested, I am unwilling that there should be any differences between us. People, however, in these days, while they fail to abide by their friendships or to stick to their friends, do not hasitate to act contrary to the principles of religion and good sense. But it is certain tnat there are matters from which no advantage is to be gained by interference ‘with them. Owing, however, to my regard and friendship for Your Honour, I do not do any thing without communicating with you and I will act with circumspection. 1 depend on you in this matter and beg for guidance from God, and thence Irom you. I trust your friendship with me will be perpetual and hope that I shall receive news of your good health without any intermission, and trust you will acquaint me with the good news of the victories of your Armies. May you be preserved, &amp;c.154 Telegram P., No. 4769, dated the 19th (received 2Cth) September 1916. From—The Arab Bureau, Basrah, T 0 The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla (repeated to Arab Bureau, Cairo ? and Secretary of State). Sons of two well-to-do local inhabitants were at Beyrout College when war broke out and remained there for first year, in January 191G, migrated, to Damascus to await opportunity to cross to Iraq. Probability of their being impressed for military service became imminent as time went on and they escaped on July 12th disguised as Bedouins and reached Medina by rail. They there joined large caravan to Kuwait and arrived recently without special incident. Tewfik Ibn Paraoon travelled with same caravan and left it at Buraidah. He was emissary to Bin Saud (who?) came to buy ( .) on behalf of Turks. He was believed to have with him 20,000 or 30,000 pounds. According to their reports Kasim Buraidah and Anaizah are completely under control of Bin Saud.

There is no doubt at aJ Pilgrimage being a success orders to this effect are sti carried out. • N.A.—Not printed.104 I shall of course keep an eye on the arrangements as far as possible * Mr. Cochrane and Mr. Young recently visited in the Quarantine station the 300 odd pilgrims who arrived a few days ago from Bombay and found matters satisfactory; no scale of prices was posted up in the station for the informa tion of the pilgrims, this will be done in the future. I leave this afternoon in H. M. S. “Hardinge ” for Yanbo and probably o. 0 inland to Faisal Bey’s camp to-morrow evening; as far as I can gather the journey will probably take three days; a day with Faisal Bey will probably suffice and I should be back in Yanbo about 2nd or 3rd of September. ^ I will endeavour to arrange for native levies to co-operate with H M’s ships in reducing Wedj in order to try and ensure the proper co-operation 0 f the Arabs; after which I would return here for a few days and then with Your Excellency’s approval, I should like to come to Alexandria to see you personally on the situation generally, remain there inside of a week and return here. Would Y r our Excellency kindly inform me on my return to Yanbo if the above is generally approved. The reason I sent my W.-87 was because the Sheriff has received letters from Suloman Rifada and states he is all right, but meanwhile the latter is somewhat naturally, taking as much gold as the Turks will give him * it there. , fore appeared fairly certain that if we opened negotiations with Rifada on our own account and anything went wrong, the Sheriff would throw all the blame on us; also a force for Wedj is being prepared at Yanbo and I hone that the place will be captured soon after my return. When the coast is clear then is the time for Colonel Parker to arrange for damaging the railway thoroughly without loss of time. 3 ^ iam ' a y , v was l ery n Iad t0 learn from Arbur ’ s telegram No. 1234 of Au-ust 22nd that lour Excellency was endeavouring to obtains complete bauerv and some machine guns for the Sheriff. Personnel is a great difficulty in fact the whole business ot giving the Sheriff military assistance bristles with difficulties he has started in a military sense, practically from bedrock ; fortunately there is plenty of good material waiting to be trained, the men appear to be very keen, and given good instructors, matters should improve.

Erom 14th to 18th we fired— 136 Shrapnel 17 Common 2,310 Maxim rounds. The enemy’s battery came close to our guns yesterday and firing lasted till evening when we stopped their fire by the help of God in the various places which they occupied during the fight. We have been informed by the soldiers of the Turkish troops who deserted to our camp to-day that the losses of the enemy are very great. Eight officers and a great number of soldiers have been killed, besides about 400 wounded who are distributed in different houses prepared for that purpose in the town because the hospital could not accommodate them. The enemy’s troops were greatly depressed because of the shortage of provisions and the great quantity of work day and night. Their Chiefs always give them stimulants to keep them awake during the night and make them hope that supplies will arrive from day to day and also reinforcements. This is the reason they will not surrender in spite of the bad state in which they are. The deserters are extremely weak and feeble, which proves that their information is true.

Wilson sends following from Rabegh, September 22nd Begins. morning Ali, Nuri and Aziz al Masri had a long conference vuc «Dufferin * at which following decision was arrived at. Ali with at least 5.000 men remains at Rnbegh. Faisal moves to Al Makshush to-day about 10 kilometers from coast half way between Yenbo and here; with him will be about 4-,000 Arabs with Egyptian artillery consisting of 4 mountain guns and 4 maxims (2 of latter being German ones brought by the ‘ Dulferin ’). There are 3,000 Arabs at Kaif and along Turkish communications to Bir Darwish which they are to harry as much as possible. In the event of Turks descending by Sultaneh Road, Faisal will allow them to get well on road to Rabegh and south of his position and will then follow them and attack them in the rear when they develop attack on Ali here. Aziz al Masri with whom I went over whole question asks for the supply as soon as possible of three quick-firing mountain batteries complete, for carriage on mules or camels; if former, mules must be sent. Though Nuri states that he has necessary personnel, 1 suggest the despatch of British artillery officer to show working if necessary. In the opinion of Ali and Aziz al Masri, Turks mean to come to Rabegh eventually, and according to latest messenger their advance is to begin to-morrow, September 23rd. Intelligence of this sort, however, is insufficiently strong and impossible to verify. All that I can recommend therefore, is that the necessary transports and brigade be held at Suez ready to leave at once at shortest possible notice. On September 24th I arrive Jeddah with Aziz-al-Masri, who goes to Taif to try and get a move on there.” Ends. It appears from other information received that Turks did not get further along Sultaneh road than Bir-Abbas, fifty miles from Medina. Thence they retired eighteen miles to Raha, but on failure of water-supply there re advanced to Bir-Abbas where they were still reported to be on September 20th. According to reports they had insufficient transport for further advance, had had many desertions and were short of provisions. As surrender of Turkish garrison at Taif now frees Arab force under Sheriff s son Abdullah for service elsewffiere, situation as far as can be judged from somewhat conflicting information appears more favourable. Aziz al Masri who has recently joined Sheriff from Fgypt, has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of Sherifian forces.

I have now received intercepted documents quoted therein. Puq ort of two of them is as follows :— r&gt; 8 ^ es ti rs t item that Jamal Pasha had telegraphed to Bin Rashid calling on him to proceed to Hail and sending him an order for 2,000 bags of rice, 1,000 bags of sugar, 1,000 of flour, 1,000 of coffee and 3,000 of Abba cloaks, all to be delivered to him at Samawa. Muhammad Asaimi on receipt oi a copy of this telegram, informed acting Wali that Bin Rashid had aireac y Jett and that proposal was impracticable as owing to bad relations jc ween tribes of Iraq his caravans were liable to be looted and the goods w ould not be safe at Samawa. Second item I quote in extemo ‘.—Begins. Vallilrt aecoUnt 1 ot Sheriff’s movements that the Turks have called upon Bin ‘. hid to proceed to Hail aud have given him these large presents and decor ations, made him ‘ Commandant ” of Nejd. Their fear is lest Bin Rashid A107 should join Sheriff and they are convinced that Hail is an important point, and that if they lose it, whole Arabian peninsula will unite as far as Damascus. They have accordingly been driven to this measure. It is a very serious move ment that the Sheriff and all tribes of Hejaz have started. Another Sheriff, Hydar Pasha, has been nominated by Government; as far as can be seen Turks are in force at Medina ; they intend to leave Hejaz until end of war. The likelihood is that they will only defend Medina and Hail in force. Ends. He writes in a third item:— Begins. From Mosul to Samawa (?) the tribal situation is not good; their attitude has changed. In particular, the Anazeh of Ihn Hazhzhal have joined Nejf and Kerbela, and Diiaim is making trouble. Affairs in short are unsatisfactory. May God put things right.

Hedjaz, ■k 0, Jeddah; ^ r » 17th August 1916. I have the honour to forward the following report to Your Excellency Arab prisoners.—As I already telegraphed 102 Arab prisoners left here for Suez on August 13th, aboard H. M. S. “Hardinge These men state that they were under the impression that they were released in order to live in the Hedjaz until the war was over, and were never asked if they were willing to fight against the Turks: that having alreadv fought for the Turks they could not now fight against them, and it would mean certain death if they were captured. I do not know if the sounding of these men as to their willingness to fight for the Sheriff was done by Sheriff Earuki but from what I saw 1 do not think they ever had the slightest intention of fighting. Turkish prisoners. —The following have left up to date : 41 Officers and 800 men on H. M. S. “ Dufferin ”, August 6 th. 11 Officers and 675 men on H. M. S. “ Hardinge ”, August 13th. 11 Officers and 362 men') 116 Civil officials ( on H. M. S. “ Dufferin ”, August 17th. 148 women and children ) This clears Jeddah of Turkish prisoners, I am glad to say. Howitzer Battery, etc. —The Battery and Horses were landed the day after arrival of the “ Laomedon ”. About noon I received a request on board H. M. S. “ Eox ” for someone to go ashore and show Noury Bey how to harness the teams. The Chaplain of H. M. S. “ Eox ”, Mr. Cochrane, and myself landed at 3 p. m., found cases of harness open and contents of same strewn on the ground. None of us had ever seen a gun team harnessed, but by 6‘30 got a team harnessed to one gun, but whether the harness was correctly put on, none of us know. The guns were eventually drawn by hand outside the town walls and the other teams harnessed. I suggested this course as during the after noon when two wheelers we had harnessed were taken a trial trip they bolted and a serious accident was avoided with difficulty. The Arab officers stated that they asked to be shown the harness in Egypt, Noth.—T hese remarks refer to the Howitzer but this, according to them, W3S not done J ^ n uest WhiCh were 86111 the Sheriff ’ 8 UrSeDfc the 7 sa y that the British gun harness is a. h. m. entirely different to what they have been accustomed to. These guns are now at Mecca and are too heavy to go to Taif nor can they go to Medina by ship to Yambo owing to their not having sand wheels. I have asked by wire whether these, or flanges to fix on to them,110 could be provided. I am endeavouring to provide gun crews for these guns by acting on a suggestion made by His Excellency the Sirdar of the Egyptian Army, viz., to get a few of the Egyptian Artillerymen from Taif to form the nucleus, obtaining Arabs from the Sheriff’s recruits to complete the teams. I have also suggested to the Sheriff that he should send some picked Arabs now to Taif to work with Said Pasha and learn how to use the mountain guns. Military situation, &amp;c.—Noury Bey, who came with the Arab prisoners, went to Mecca with the Arab officers who accompanied him and has left to join Ali Bey’s army before Medina taking with him the two maxims and also two mountain guns captured from the Turks. The chief need of both Eaysal Bey and Ali Bey is artillery, hence my telegram, No. W.-64 of August 16th, in which I asked whether it was possible to procure two or three mountain guns and man them by volunteers from Egytian artillery officers and men now on pension. The Sheriff informs me he has 1,500 recruits waiting at Mecca to be train ed and instructors are urgently required, vide my W.-56 of 16th August. He also informed me on August 16th that numerous Sheikhs from the Nejd district (1 understand this is a general term applied to the country east of the Medina railway) came to Ali Bey and guaranteed themselves to be responsible that no more Turkish reinforcements came by rail to Medina and would entirely cut off Medina from the north. I was unable to ascertain how these Arabs proposed to carry out their guarantee. Eaysal Bey is said to be intending to attack the Turks from the south west : 1 hope that he will be able to come to Yanbo as I am confident that a personal interview is the only possible way in which I can get the slightest conception of the real state of affairs; if Eaysal Bey gives an opening for doing so I propose to visit his camp with Captain Boyle, B. N. Erom an A rah who arrived here on 15th August direct from Medina I got the following intelligence:— That there are about 20,000 Turkish troops in and arround Medina. That there are at least 1,000 German and Austrian Officers and men; he knows this as they wear helmets and cannot talk Turkish or Arabic. That when the Turks took a small village called El Ola near Medina, these people raped the w r omen and brutally illtreated everybody. That Ali Haidar Pasha has left Medina and returned to Syria : the reason given is that he came to be with the Arabs and win their sympathies but as be found that the Turks were fighting the Arabs he clearly saw that his mission w r as futile. Oreifan met messengers from Ali Bey to the Sheriff on the Mecca road (August 16th). He states that some 3,000 to 4,000 Turks were cut off on August 3rd at Cadir Rabek of whom 1,500 have been killed: they have little water or food and only machine and no Eield guns. Several German and Austrian dead have been found on the field which proves the presence of a German force which is estimated at about 1,500. Reports from Taif have been received to the effect that serious casualties are being caused to the enemy forces and that the latter have started laying mines. 1 gather that the Turkish position consists of a strong fort on the summit of the highest hill in the neighbourhood with a system of trenches round the hill. If correct, this, with the well known defensive powers of the Turk, is sufficient to account for the prolonged operations. Sheriff Mohsin paid a long visit to me yesterday evening and stated that the people of Mecca were getting somewhat restless on account of Taif resisting so long. The Sheriff sent me a special message by Mohsin to beg me to have aeroplanes sent to laif as he seriously believes that the sight of one aeroplane would cause the lurks to surrender. I informed him I was very sorry but none were avail able, and pointed out difficulties and various preparations which w'ould have to be made.Ill The chief reason the Sheriff wishes to have two or three Egyptian or Sudanese Battalions at Yanbo or with Faysal Bey is to give the latter’s array a stiffening in the event of the Turks descending on Yanbo, which they are reported to be thinking of doing. I insisted on British officers being with these battalions if they can be provided, because I certainly would not recommend their use otherwise. I also insisted (my W.-39 of August 12th) that British officers must wear their own uniforms and not go about like natives. As some British officers of the Indian Army wear turbans, there is perhaps not so much objection to Egyptian army officers wearing them if they can be properly made, but I objected on principle to any conditions being laid down as to what British officers should wear. I do not think that the Sheriff himself cares one way or the other, but he has to consider the fanatical attitude of the uneducated Arabs. Kunjida .—Three days ago I asked the Sheriff to send a friendly letter to the Idrisi with Sheikh Muhammad Oreifan and suggested the lines on which the letter should be written : he replied that he would not only write all I asked him to but would put my points in stronger terms. Yesterday morning I received a message from the Sheriff to the effect that Oreifan had left Mecca with the letter for the Idrisi which was open for me to read and if I wished any alterations in it was to inform him at once and he could make them. Oreifan arrived last night about 7 p.m. and I took him off to H. M. S. “ Eox”, so that Captain Boyle, Senior Naval Officer, could see the letter and hear my instructions to Oreifan, and the latter then went on board H. M. S. “Lunka” which left at once for Birk. The letter is in my opinion satisfactory, and as is frequently the case, Oreifan carries a verbal message to the Idrisi which should smooth over all difficulties. I attach translation of the letter and the verbal message for Your i Excellency’s information and trust that on the return of Oreifan the Kunfida incident will be satisfactorily closed. Sheriff .—My relations with the Sheriff continue to be most friendly. He issued orders for a police guard to be at my house and last night issued orders for a telephone from Sheriff Tahir’s house to be installed in my house by this morning. This has been done, and on receipt of the telephones I have asked for, I will hand one over to Sheriff Moshin who returned from Mecca on the 15th. General .—Raouf Bey is.Mamour of police here with Kamel Effendi as his Meawin. Dr. Malouf is Medical Officer of Health. About 25 police have been raised and the present fixed establishment is 50. I have various letters, &amp;c., from the Sheriff which I will send by next mail if I can get tbe translations finished. The Sheriff has given orders that everybody is to consult me and take my advice, &amp;c., this from my experience of the last two days means constant interviews and I find it somewhat difficult to get through the work. Matters will be greatly improved if I can be sent two capable clerks who can typewrite and file correspondence, &amp;c. I have the honour to be, &amp;c., C. L. Wilson, Lieutenant-Colonel. H.

In the name of God the most merciful compassionate. The honourable and respectable El Sayed el Sheriff Mohammed Ibn Aly El Idrisi. Peace and mercy of God be upon you. The reason for my writing this letter is firstly to ask about your health; secondly to tell you about the arrival of Homoud Ibn Sendaab and Abdu of Birk and Kunfida together with those who came with him. There has resulted the confusion of the minds and feelings of the public here in a manner which is unbearable and which is inclined to hinder the good effect of both our endeavours and intentions which we aim at all of which was quite different from what you had explained to Sheikh Mohammed Ibn Oreifan and was not in harmony with your decision to him concerning the boundaries, &amp;c. It surprised us to see such things take place without any foundation. Our Lord the Idrisi (may God guide him) must not think that we are practising ambition to gain a high degree or envying you or anything of the same sort. Never. Oh never. In addition to what I said—the plans for both Hedjaz and Asir cannot be altered. Consequently to remove the misunderstandings that may arise I am sending the abovementioned Sheikh Mohammed to act according to our previous decisions and so that you may issue your orders to those above- mentioned to leave Kunfida: and he will inform you of certain articles referring to certain affairs especially the removal of the causes of dispute that exist and which may happen to come between you and the Imam of Yemen. We all have confidence in your servant|the above mentioned Sheikh Mohammed. My son Zeid who is with me now kisses your hands, accept my great and innumerable salaams and greeting. May the mercy and blessings of God be upon you. The Sheriff and Amir of Mecca. Dated 16 Shawal 1334, (Sealed) El Hussein, Ibn Ali. Enclosure Eo. 4. Verbal message sent by the Sheriff to the Idrisi with Sheikh Mohammed Oreifan, dated the 16th August 1916— (1) Salaams, &amp;c. (2) It is just the same after the war is finished. No difference between us. If you want to take Kunfida or any other place, such can be done after the war. There will be you, I and the British Government which will decide. (3) V e do not want to lay difficulties in either of our ways. I want Kuniida now only because all the Arabs there came to me and asked my protection : otherwise I would not have asked for it. The intention is not to create trouble but that our work may continue satisfactorily in driving the Turks from the Yemen and from all Arabia and other places. Sheikh Mohammed Ibn Oreifan left on H.

I have the honour to forward to you herewith translation of the proclama tion issued in the Hedjaz by Ali Heiclar, the newly-appointed Turkish Sheriff. This is our letter to the people of our country El Hejaz and those near them whether townsmen or nomads far or near. We thank God for having brought us up in the cradle of Islam, strengthened us all by Muhammad (prayers and peace be upon him) made us with you neighbours to the Holy House, and granted us all the privileges and rights of the neighbour—thanks that no words can express, and we pray to and salute our Lord and ancestor the best of men, w T ho was chosen from the Arabs, and who compiled his obedience to God with his obedience to the Imam according to His saying c&lt; Obey God and His Prophet and your masters ”, and his household and friends who obeyed him to the last degree. Thirteen centuries have passed since the beginning of Islam during which it has gone through different stages of welfare and of adversity, has lost many of its territories and strength but also at times regained and revived them. It has not left a single enemy country into which it has not entered, and there is not one Mohammedan country into which the enemies have not tried to enter, except our country the noble Hejaz. History does not record any invasion of ^ Hejaz except by Moslem nations, it has remained immune from invasion in spite of the changes in times and destiny, it has been raised to a point that no enemy could leach. The enemy has invaded Egypt, the Sudan and India, Yemen, Ahkaf, Amman and vicinity, and this time he made an attempt on Basrah, but did not dare to approach Mecca and the Hejaz, the blessed country of the Moslems and the Khalit's. The enemy continued his efforts until the general war broke out and the Ottoman Government rose to avenge Islam. The enemy then could not hrmp fnv aWhino- tn TTeiaz as well as in any other country, nor could he aspire No. 221. Mv Lord, * The Residency, Ramleh, 12th September 1916.

The Viscount Grey of Fallodon, K.G. &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. TRANSLATION. In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate.116 knows the secret, neither before the Prophet whose Law is that of the snrT r nor before the people of Islam who know what the English are and what thejr are doing. The Sheriff Hussein cannot efface a single word of the truth nor convince anybody of his competence to be an independent Emir, to fight against the Government and to assume charge of the affairs of Moslems, and to claim full ability to protect Islam. Therefore to be able to fight against a Great Power like the Ottoman Government he must necessarily shield himself under the wings of a foreign Government. This is what he has actually done in agreement with England who is deceiving him and picturing to him all sorts of false hopes to make him revolt against the Government who is protecting him, so that when England succeeds in this policy (may God forbid it) his case with her will be the same as that of the Khedive of Egypt, the Sultan of Zanzibar, Emir of Lahej and the Emir of India and the rest of the Islamic Governments who have fallen into the English trap. He who sees what has befallen others, should beware lest the same misfortune befall him also. The Sheriff, before opening hostilities with a Power much superior to him, should have considered the fact that England would not help him unless she was afterwards to govern him and that the moment she stretches her finger to Hejaz she will not relax her efforts until by degree she ahnexes it to the other countries which she has already fraudulently occupied. Let him ask those Emirs who have done likewise before him, and let him read the treaties which England made with them and with others. He will then under stand how those Governments have changed from existence to non-existence and how they regret now what they have done. No matter how much the Sheriff Hussein contradicts our belief that the Hejaz will be a field for Chris tian troops, the fact is that the troops wiiom England will send him, whether Moslem or Christians, are but servants of England, fighters in the Armv of a Christian Government, wearing her arms and obeying her orders, and thus there is really no difference in them, whether they are Moslems or Christians so long as the consequences that are going to fall upon Islam are the same. The head is the leader and the other numbers follow. There is no one who denies that if those Moslem troops (according to the Sheriff) conquer the Ottoman troops the result will be a victory for Christian England over Moslem Turkey. In other words the result will be (God forbid it) that Christianity will have the upper hand over Islam, in the cradle of Islam and the house of Mohammed (prayers of God on him). Whether those Moslem troops are in the service of the Christians or of the Sheriff Hussein himself who has joined them, they are officially under the command of England. God said “ He who governs them is from them His argument that because the Ottoman Gov ernment is allied with the Germans, who are Christians, he has the right then to be allied with England does not hold water, for the reason that Turkey joine t e Germans to fight with them against Christian Government and to use them tor revenging Islam on its enemies taking the opportunity of their isumon to separate them more and more. She has succeeded and has seen them torturing each other thus punishing them for their oppressions of Islam, further, the Germans, although Christians, have not occupied a yard of territory in Moslem lands, neither did they reduce to poverty and servitude resne^hle nS 'U° £ i M0S emS * th ? ■ Eu S llsh wll ° have enslaved the most respectable Moslem countries and their inhabitants, and who earnestly nowe^oT d P °f 7 ? 0Wer in Islam and t0 deprive it of all them The fn the M°, sie “ s may be unable to revolt against will lie tn dem-Ve +1 'If , e y W1 *l do, if they attain any success in the Hejaz, will be to depnye the Arabs of their arms, first by way of uurchase as they thTreyZtion of t ^ ^ ^ S °^ Yemen'whth resulted in tribes in Fevn! ^ a i Ca « ; / nd 8eC&lt; ie d b ? ^ as tl,e y have done with the Arabs shall E hInneh 1 e t Suda - n l , S ,° that ^ they wanted to enter the country the Germanv ami flip air rt° ieS !&gt;h -u m ’i ^ ere ^ ore &gt; there is no comparison with and God^savs “ Cnrl f 1006 although both belong to one religon; do not fiTt j f °i bld y ° U f i r ° m bein - “s with those who, countrv von shnnlrl + ^ re l 1 § 10n an( l a who do not chase you from your country, you should treat them with justice, for God loves the just 5 but God117 forbids you from befriending those who fight your religion and chase you from your country by using some of you to help them do so.” The English have severed India, Egypt, the Sudan, Zanzibar, Somaliland, and a part of Arabia from the body of Islam and occupied them. They turned the strength of their inhabi tants into weakness. They were not satisfied with that but helped the French to occupy Morocco and Central Africa, helped the Russians to occupy Persia and the Italians to occupy Tripoli. They even came into agreement with their own enemies against the Moslems. There remains nothing they have not done in order to destroy Islamism. The Hedjaz only remained exempt from their aggression, but now, unfortunately, it is no more so. They have found a means for their aims in the person of a man who should have been the first to defend the Uedjaz, putting at bis disposal money and men, and because our familv is responsible for the safety of the House. All men know how our ancestor El Hussein Ibn Ah, relinquished the Khalifate in order to prevent Moslem bloodshed, and out of sympathy for the religion; therefore he in whose days the Christian Powers stretch their hand to Hedjaz for the first time in history is not one of us, and this great trespass should not be recorded incur history after our glorious stand in the past in support of the religion Eor this reason and in conformity with the conduct of our ancestors when^ the “ Amir of the Eaithful ” our lord Sultan Muhammad Rasbad V. has conferred upon me the Imarat of Mecca at a time when the Hejaz is in real dano-er I accepted it with the help of God, not because I desire authority and power—for this already pertains to us—but out of sympathy for the Holy Places lest they ^should fall in the hand of the enemy, who if he once interferes in its affairs and is not opposed will shortly enter it and tread on its sacred soil that has been sacred for over 1,300 years. If God and His Prophet command a thin'- we must obey and rise up to the jehad. We must also explain to you clearly how, in joining the Christian, the Sheriff Hussein has placed the Holy Places under their mercy, that the weak among you may not be deceived by the false hood that has affected the poor people of the desert and in order that the ignorant, who have been taken in by these falsehoods, may not oblio’e us to unsheath our sword in their faces. We call you all to obedience, it being the call of the Koran, the call of the Sultan and the call of our forefathers whom the affairs of El Hejaz concern. We call you to be united and to rush to fight the troops who are sent by the Christian English and those who dare to befriend them, and to support the troops of the Sultan who are advancing on Medina and Mecca to cleanse them from the infidels. And he who disobeys the call of God and His Prophet, the anger of God will fall upon him. He who sees the foreigner begin to send his forces to the Holy Places and does not rise and defend them, does not belong to the Prophet; and he who dares to help those foreigners who are the enemies of the religion, in any way, or agrees with any one who- revolts against the Government, he will render himself liable to torture in this world and in the other. I do not wish to believe that there is anyone among the people of these Holy Districts who will choose to obey Satan, and disobey the Sultan, or accepts the infidel rather than the faithful, and I do. not wish to see the people of those places give their necks to our swords whose deeds they have witnessed in our battles with the English and the French when they attacked Chanak Kalaa and returned with failure. We have no doubt that God will protect those places where His House is, and which hold the bones of our Prophet, and will help you to succeed in this Holy War. Eight so that the word of God may be uppermost and you may gain the riches of this world and the next, and bring shame and defeat upon those who dare to play with the house of God as well as upon the foreigners who keep them. Eight so that you may shortly enter the Holy Mosque in peace wdth your heads uplifted. Do not be deceived by the intriguers and the liars and do not be afraid of their power, for God will make you conquer. May He include you in His Army and support you. 10th Shaical, 1334. Ali Heidar.

All questions having direct or indirect bearing on our operations in Mesopotamia will doubtless be discussed during visit of new Commander-in- Chief in India, who is expected within a few days. I imagine Bin Saud has some qualms of conscience in respect of under takings be gave to Turks in bis treaty with them of May 1914 and will not enter actively into lists against them if he can avoid it. He will piobably do no more than continue to worry Bin Bashid in a desultoiy way at a respectable distance from Hail if we confine ourselves to exhortations in geneial teims. In mv opinion, he cannot, and would not, attack Hail without our assist ance in monev and guns and men to man them. If he weie willing to do so with such assistance, would it he worth our while to give it ? Shoit of that, he could be definitely pressed to arm and equip with transport some 1,000 of his own tribesmen mounted on camels and send them to join the Sheriff. I have already urged him to arrest Turkish emissary Ibn Paraoon and prevent him getting camels. Though he may do latter, he wdll certainly not the former. Does any other form of assistance which he could render suggest itself ? As Regards expression “all territories included in Arab Kingdom”, “ Kingdom ” in English or Arabic presupposes a King, and I was afraid that Sheriff in sending letter or emissary to Bin Saud might quote term to him and that it w'ould certainly alarm Bin ' Saud. “Arab Confederation” or “Arab League ” present to my mind a widely different conception w hich admits of frank discussion with any Arab Chief. 172 Telegram P., dated the 28th (received 29th) September 1916.

I have the honour to forward, herewith, translation of a letter, dated August 25th, which I have received from the Grand Sheriff. It will be noticed that the letter recognizes the temporary nature of the monthly payment now made to the Sheriff. (M ^ | Beseived on 13 NOV 1916 with INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter. No. ^ ; m \ hated £3 0311916 j2 In regard to the objects for which it is given and the present manner of expenditure, I have thought fit to send the Sheriff a verbal hint that he should endeavour to counteract the influence of Turkish gold among the Arab tribes by more generous payments on his own part. His sons Faisal and Ali think more might be done in this manner than hitherto. The reference to future monetary compensation for our occupation of Basrah and Iraq needs no further comment at the present moment. Our failure to attack the railway line north of Hedjaz is a matter to which the Sheriff is constantly calling my attention, and I shall be glad when I can be in a position to tell him that action is actually being taken. The question is still under the consideration of the military authorities. The big guns, which the Sheriff mentions as having been found too heavy for the bad Hedjaz roads, were a battery of howitzers which were sent merely to satisfy his urgent request, and referred to in my despatch No. 176 (Secret) of July 25th. Since the despatch of this letter, much additional assistance in guns, rifles and ammunition, &amp;c., has been sent to the Sheriff; and I shall forward to Your Lordship, at an early date, a complete list of all material of this sort which we have so far sent to the Hedjaz. I have sent a copy of this despatch, with the Sheriff’s letter, to the Viceroy and Governor-General of India. I have the honour to be, My Lord, with the highest respect, Your Lordship's most obedient, humle servant, A. Henky McMahon. ft The Viscount Grey of Fallodon, K.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. ■j* Enclosure No. 2. Copy of a letter from His Highness the Sheriff and Amir of Mecca to His Excellency the High Commissioner, dated the 25th August 1916. His Excellency the eminent Vizier and His Majesty^s High Commissioner in Egypt. (In addition to my telegram, dated 21st instant, which was very short, I am sending you this note as an appendix to it.) My dear friend, You have stated in your letter of the 20th July which contained the advice concerning the comfort of the pilgrims and the security of the roads, that Great Britain had granted us her great temporary monthly gilt which amounts to £125,000 for the above great purpose. Consequently, O dear and honourable friend, I am powerless to thank you for such generosity and care, although Great Britain is accustomed to such noble acts, worthy of her world renowned merit. Nevertheless, I am proud to inform Your .Excellency that the attainment of convenience and comfort for all sorts of visitors of God’s House and the Xaaba does not, by the grace of God, depend upon the above-mentioned temporary payments, of which I have now got £215,000 untouched (besides the £45,000 which were spent during the last 40 days as salaries and requirements for the Arabs and the tribes ne^r Medina and for those whom we want to attract towards us). This has resulted3 up till now in the resistance of our troops which were armed with rifles only (given by your help and endeavour) and they were able to face the two divisions sent from Syria and Medina, armed with all kinds of modern arms. To-day also we handed the interpreter of His Excellency the British Agent in Jeddah £10,000 to take to Yanbo with the troops for the troops which are going to be sent from there (Yanbo) and to hand the money to him who should receive it. Your^ Excellency knows that the above-mentioned monthly pay of £125,000 is for the organisation of Government and its necessary administrations, and will be deducted from the amount which we left to the justice of Great Britain to decide for our deficient Government which is under Great Britain’s truardianship and protection during her occupation of Basrah and Iraq. But here are the consequences which undoubtedly resulted from forgetfulness and which are clearly apparent to the present moment: the failure to attack the railway, the benefit of which would be mutual, and which was one of our decisions, and also the sending to us of the big guns which cannot be taken tlirough the bad roads of our country to the necessary spots. All such things lead to the prolongation of the period of the fighting against the Turks and their advance about a day’s distance from Medina, whereas we were sure according to our plans that our fighting would by now be in the vicinity of Damascus. All this has cost us much unexpected expenditure and labour and finally we have been compelled to organise a force to send to the neighbourhood of Rabegh to face whatever may befall. Yet I repeat my request to you to send a warship with an aeroplane or seaplane to Rabegh and another ship with a flying machine to Yanbo with the consignment of rifles demanded by telegraph as soon as possible. Elease accept my best compliments and honour to Your Excellency. The Sheriff and Amir of Mecca, Hussein. 4 Telegram P., No. 257-A. P., dated (and received) the 6th October 1916.

Eurther letter from Bin Saud, dated Septem ber 3rd, has just been recqiv^tb Np allusion is made to receipt of any fresh4 communication from Sheriff, but he apparently means his present letter to he the “ further reference ” he had promised, vide my telegiam No. 4523 of September 7th. He first alludes to need for guns before mentioned as regards question of attacking Ibn Rashid in or near Hail, but then remarks that only present obstacle is that he regards political juncture as unfavourable. If questions of attacking Bin Rashid and assisting Sheriff are merely matters of Arab policy concerning chiefs inter se, then it is a question of watching for such a suitable opportunity as will ensure a successful result and this, he says, they may be counted upon to do. If either project on the other hand affects (our ?) interests as well as his own, he says he will no doubt conform to our wishes and views after discussion and preferably personal meeting with me. I could probably arrange, with Army Commander’s permission, a meeting with him towards end of October, but unless it is desired to press upon him some specific action, it would perhaps be better not to have meeting just now, and simply inform him that His Majesty’s Government hope he will do his utmost to support Sheriff in whatever way he considers fit and feasible.

Arab revolt. Wilson sends following :— Begins. No. 241. Parker sends following: — Begins. October 3rd, Rabegh. Hope to-morrow to complete reconnaissance and will send telegraph summary of result. Following is brief appreciation of military situat ion If Mecca is denied to Turkish force, Arab cause is successful. Lack of troops will probably not permit Turks to send more than one division south from Medina. Force must come by Rabegh accord ing to all reports, and if Rabegh is held, Arab cause is, therefore, won. Opposi tion offered to a Turkish advance before arrival at Rabegh of a guerilla nature, though considerable. A Turkish division, if successful in pressing through, would probably succeed in capturing Rabegh from present garrison. Presence of a force of two battalions of British troops entrenched at Rabegh would, from a political point of view, probably deter Turks from undertaking advance. A British Brigade landed two days before a Turkish attack should, from a military point of view, be sure to beat off Turk force. As regards aeroplanes, I would remark that they would be valuable addition to a British force, though of no very material assistance to purely Arab resistance to Turkish attack. The landing of flight of aeroplanes, moreover, commits us to co-operation in land operations, success of which we cannot ensure without landing troops. Without an advance, land aeroplanes, moreover, are only slightly more efficient than seaplanes. Ends. In my opinion, batteries asked for by Arabs are most necessary. Is there any chance of these being sent ? End of Wilson. In consequence of conflicting accounts of need of aeroplanes, Commander- in-Chief and 1 are agreed that despatch of proposed flight should be held up for the present.

Steps have been taken by Sheriff to stop camels being brought from Nejd by Ibn Kroon. Arabs are daily harrying eomnm- mcations near Medina. J u u Faisal has advanced to Jadid west of Bir Abbas with 3,000 men, and 4 000 more are to join him. ^ Ali is intrenching at Babegb with 5,000. When water is sufficient Abdulla with 4,000 will advance up the eastern road. There are 3,000 Joheinah north of Medina operating against railway and preventing advance on Yanbo by northern road. ° On September 22nd, Saad Ghoneim of Joheinah left for Yanbo with 1,200 camels to raid Dilli. Six hundred of Ibn Saud 5 s men have been with Ali for some weeks. Mahmal, which Ali had proposed to give safe passage to Mecca, has not yet arrived at Medina. So far, Sheriff’s negotiations with Ibn Bashid have been unsuccessful and he is increasing his offer. Sheriff claims Anizah, Aidah and Fuqkir to be with him. He has a re presentative with Nuri Shalan. Owing to fall of Taif and failure of Turks to advance from Medina, there has been a great improvement in Arab morale and confidence. After losing much of his following owing to his refusal to take oath of loyalty to Sheriff Hussein, Mabeiriq has left apparently for Medina to join Turks. Reports from Syria show widespread impression among all classes based on magnified rumours of Sheriff’s successes. One thousand and eight hundred Turks with two guns have just captured Kunfidah after hard fighting. Sheriff will send force against them shortly. Ends. 8 Telegram P, No. 258-A.

After we hed gone about eleven miles we reeched e poet on the roed and were examined by tne giard who said that as we had no gaard witn us, the roed dangerous and its being nignt we must remain there till tne following morning. I told him we had to get on as the Sherif was expecting us the next day. The commander of the post replied tnat he nad strict orders to let no one proceed wno was not properly protected. We therefore remained the rest of tne night there and went on again in the morning. When we reacned BHJSRA (half way between JEDDA and l.EGCA) we sent a telegram to tne Sherif to let him know that we had been delayed. He sent a reply to BHERA ordering two camel guards to be provided and for us tc be brought on so as to reach MECCA tnat night. We reached MECCA on the evening of tnetne 27th end were met outside the city by Sheikh Selieh, Manhsan Der A1 I si eh (Quarter I aster G-eneral) who took us to the house we were to occupy. ftlote . From JSDDA to MECCA is about 55 miles, every 4 or 5 miles there are arrangements for water and a guard of 10 or 12 men. Special guards under canvas have been posted in addition in dangerous places on the road as for instance st a defile. ho road exists as we understand it, merely traoiva - generally tne surface of the ground is suitable for any kind of transport and guns but there are places difficult to cross on account of deep soft sand. The so-called real wound and twisted about among the two hills. (end of note). The other pilgrims come in parties of various numbers accompanied by a few police. No raid or looting of any description took place during our visit except one small raid on the other side of MECCA between VUZALFA and APFAT. Unfortunately for some reason our clothes and baggage did not arrive at MECCA for three days and we were unable to pay our respects to the Sherif. He, however, sent down special instructions and all the baggage arrived safely. As I said before one man was placed in charge of each group of pilgrims to act as guide and generally to look after them. Each pilgrim peid him Rs; 10/- of which Rs:2/- was for water and Rs: B/- for his services. Food cost tnem 110/- annas a day. As far as possible the prices on foodstuils were controlled. Prices for transport camel and donkey were as follows:- Camel JEDDA to 1.KCCA Rs:7.8.0 two men rode on a camel. Donkey - do - Rs:6.4.0 one man. MECCAMECCA to ARAFAT and return do MECCA to JEQDA camel donkey camel donkey 6.8.0 rupees 15.0. 0 rupees 7.8.0 10 . 0 . 0 All feeding men and animals extra. Transport arrangements were very good though I do not know about tne return journey as we left before the others. Water comes underground via ARAFAT and is of good quality. Three days previous to the visit to ARAFAT it was reduced in order to collect it, tnere. It was sold along the road at 11/- anna a glass and for -/!/- a small skin at ARAFAT. Medical ; I visited the hospital which is in a large building in very good order in cnarge of two qualified doctors and ward orderlies. There were 40 patients, mostly fever cases, a few cuts, etc., and no wounded. This hospital is called GABAN KHANA. In addition there are two dispensaries with European ledicines. There was a doctor in charge of medical arrangements at ARAFAT as far as I know there w?;S no epidemic whatsoever a.i-ong the pilgrims. Police : A police force has been formed consisting of one Inspector paid £10 a month, one Sub-Inspector £5 a month, 1 sergeant paid £4 a month, 40 men paid i2.10.C a monih. They wear a uniform consisting of blue kurta, blue waistcoat, and red *Aqel*. The name of the Inspector is IBRAHIM RAMLI. Food Stuffs. Haring the blockade Present price Wheat : Rs : 2.8.0 per 4 lbs. 0.12.0 Ri ce : Rs : 2.0.0 ' 1. 8.0 OilSutsar : Rs : 6.0.0 Dal : Rs : 3.0.0 1 . 0.0 1 . 8.0 hote. During ti^e time of scarcity aiid higi prices the Sherif lived on exactly the same food as the poor. The total number of pilgrims present at tne 'Standing*' at ARAFAT were as follows From India 2,060 Morocco 640 Egypt 1,000 Yemen 2,500 t.ecca and district 17,000 TOTAL 23,220 The pilgrims were very contented with their treatment they suffered no looting or loss. All v/ere housed either with friends inhabitants or special hostels. to pilgrims were allowed to sleep in the Losque at night. All charges were far less than formerly and were fixed by the Sherif; any glide complained of by the pilgrims in this respect and brought to the notice of the Sherif was severely dealt with. The Indian merchants at LECCA were discontented with the Snerif because prices were controlled, tne pilgrimage a small one and the TUrks had been good customers. Chief of the discontented ones were Abdulla Saidulla Abu Jeban LiOhd. Said. The Sherif in this respect is understood to be about to ask for a reliable Indian to influence tnese mei* in his favour Acdul 1 ail Pasha has been placed over the Beduin element and ne is tne very man for tne ;ost. They lear him greatly and at tne same time ne is not too harsh. He keeps them in splendid order. - neTrie iUKr ime^e to Arafat . The pilgrimage to Arafat statted from kBCCA on the 6th Cctocci. ioouie went on foot, acme on donkeys and camels. The distance is about 10 or 12 miles; the road winds among mountains. The first place reached is PINA about four miles from a bazaar was erected for the pilgrimage a d it is here that the sacrifice is made of goats and camels. On the return from ARAFAT. It is here also that there are three devils represented by a wall at which the pilgrims tnrow stones. Tne next place is ! AZALFA four miles further on. here also a bazaar was erected and water supplied; no houses, simply tents. There were no gpards and no need of any. The pilgrims ned no guards there was only a giard with the kahmal. The hherif left 1 KCCA in the evening escorted by his new giard of 300 men, his geests and hundreds of beduin on camels and on foot. There was any amount of water sold along tne road for a sma 11 sum. The order is to be at 'RAFAT before day-break. The pilgrims were under canvas. They were large tents covered with paintings, etc., and cost for lodging Rs:10 about 10 or 12 a tent. There are no oroper houses but a very large number of snops had been e rected for the supply of necessaries. Food was fairly cheap. They all said food cost far w&gt; less than on former pilgrimages. There were postal and telegraph arrangements. We remained till tne evening. Pilgrims have to arrive bet ore daybreak. j-rayers are read at If’SJID IBRAHIM. Prayers of two times at once i. e. XLi.e. 12.0 and 3.0 o’clock prayers are combined and read as one. Then as many pilgrims climb ARAFAT for the KHUTBA. inis iini sues oefore sunset. The sermon was preached by a priest nominated by the Sharif. The pilgrims have to return to MOZALFA before daybreak tne nezt day. Travers are read at 6 and 9. They stay tne night there; after daybreak and prayers they set out for MINA. First they throw stones at the tig devil, make tneir sacrifices, then snave, tney csii Liien return to M2CCA. There wae absolutely no trouble to anyone over the whole proceedings whicn worked quite simply and well. There was no confusion at all. to prevent a lot of meat lying about, tne surplus not required for food was burned. Having heard prayers in JECCA, changed tneir raiment, tne pilgrims returned to MftA. We returned to l EGCA for tne ten prayers. There was no trouble at all, police were unnecessary, tne crowds were always orderly, the rich and poor went alike in an orderly manner to pray. 1 do not know wnat neppened in past years but tnis pilgrimage was a great success.VISITS TO TliF: 3H?RIF . October 1st 1916. Sneikh SALIKH (q.v.) took us and introduced us to the Sherif who received us in his private rooms and gave us a most cordial welcome. He lives in a beautiful ho. se and is well guarded. After exchanging tne usual salutations and compliments we congratulated him on his successes. He thanked us very warmly; we then delivered the letter of introduction given us by H.K. the High Commissioner. 'Ae told him we had had the pleasure of meeting nis sons Ali Bey, Faisal Bey and Zeid. He was delighted especially about Ali Bey, expresse the wannest affection for him end said 'He is my fevourite son' (naaib). He then talked about HFTIFA and added that the tribes of I,EDINA and the Northern HEJ/Z had given an d ( undertaking to join him if he took the city. H6 complained about not receiving more ammunition end the mountain batteries from the British and said he had repeatedly asked for them. He went on to say 'Ly men do not understand gifiis and machine guns and if only tne British Government would send us instructors they would soon learnI replied: “The British Goven^ent is doing its level best to assist you and a large number of rifles and machine guns were landed at fENBO and RABEGH from the ship on which we were.' He replied: 'Yes, that is so. but there is not enough ammunition. I can only plan but the High God will carry out those plans . Note . To my own personal knowledge (Captain Bray) I think the Sherif had been misinformed. For the two machine guns landed at YENBO 120,000 rounds of ammunition were landed and the ammunition for the remaining ©ins landed at RABEGH wasin like proportion. Besides this s very large quantity oi rifle ammunition was landed both at YliNBO and RAB^GH. Ho continued: 'I firmly believe that if I can get the supplies I asK for I can occupy Syria'. i ooia I hoped ne would soon be able to send a strong force to I. jlDIHA. He replied: “It is my intention to do so and when Abdulla moves yp the Eastern Road we will be able to attack 1 EDINA from three sides'. I here made mention of Aziz Bey Misri ’s name the Sherif put his linger between his teeth and shook his head with disapproval and gave us a sign by placing his finger on his lips not to speak before him. After this we took our leave. He expressed the hope that Abdulla would arrive the next day arid asked especially aLOut our comfort. October 2nd 'we paid a short formal visit to give him the presents we had brought. He was very delighted and said one of them would have been sufficient. While we were there he received a letter from Feisal asking for more ammunition. We then took our leave. Note . The Sherif gave the gold watch to Abdulla. October 4th We visited him again. He asked especially after our comfort and expressed regret tnat the pilgrimage was a small one♦ I replied: 'Many tlohammadans are fighting all over tne world, their affairs have to be looked after by tnose relations not fighting, on account of the fighting many are nervous to make the venture but after the war I hope you will have the large numbers you are used.to' .He said: 'I have t^e intention of asking tiie authorities of outside countriesnot to fcllow pilgrims to come totally unprovided with money or any means of subsistence, they give endless trouble both to us and the otner pilgrims. It is also written in the Koran that the Haj is only compulsory for tnoae that can afford it the poor are excused. I will also try t get the religious teachers to explain this'. I replied that if he gave me permission I would myself bring this point to notice. I also congratulated him on the excellent arrangements he had made for the pilgrims and their comfort. He replied: 'We have only just taken it in hand and I have every hope that we will improve on the arrangements in the future, I would be grateful for any suggestions.' Here we took our leave. October bth We visited him again. I as&amp;ed hirn if he would give us a letter for Indian kohaiimedans, and continued 'Your Excellency knows very well t..at ery Mohammedan according to the teaching of his religion and tne dictates of God bears the deepest reverence towards the Haj. I am extremely grateful that through the kindness of my Government I have had this opportunity of coining. Next to my own gratification of coming I have this most earnest oesire namely tnat Your Excellency’s present independent position may be recognised by Indian Mohammedans. Your Excellency knows very well tnat in every place the enemy has its spies and tnat tnere are always evilly disposed persons ready to poison tne minds of the ignorant and those who acu on rough ignorance of the true facts. iy hope is that I may carry bscK witn me to India the truth and the real position of affairs. Having seen tilings for my sell and received a letter from Your Excellency concerning your reasons lor taking action against the Tur^s, acting solely on your own ini tin tiveI initiative. I may explain it to my comrades in India. In order that the Mohammedans of India may recognise you as their spiritual head and realize your motives. n For although certain newspapers have published the truth about these affairs, those in opposition make out that these facts have been concocted by our Government. If Your Excellency agrees I would ask for a letter explaining these things.' The Sherif replied: 'Only a. short wnile ago I had printed and sent out a proclamation setting forth our objects aims and reasons for our break with Turkey. There is no necessity for a further explanation since my position is clearly put forward in tne one I refer to. I will give you a copy (waxen he did later) There are bound to be thousands in the world in disagreement witn our policy, as indeed tnere were before tnese events took place, but tare tnis message back witn you. I am trying selflessly to serve tne interests of Lohammsdanism; had I intended to benefit myself I had far better opportunities under the old regime, (see note), but I have broken away purely for the good of Islam. Note . The bherif nad great inducements made him by the Turks including a very large money brioe to remain loyal to tnem. The Sherif was extremely pleased witn what I had said to him arid said: 'may bud prosper you in your intentions. Gc tobex' II tn On nearing of Feisal's success at EIR ABBAS we again visited him to congratulate him.I did ao and wished him further successes. He replied -Please God we will certainly win-. I told him we were lea/ing the next day and if I could assist his cause in any way I hoped he would let me know. At first he did not wish to let us go and made great efforts to detain us, for at any rate a few days but when I e nlained the necessity ^or our leading he very reluctantly agreed to our going. Ho said there were one or two points he would like to . iin to the notice of tno ritish Government. Jie said!** ' Vith the greatest sincerity and belief I say that next to Islam I respect and revere the British and for the following reasons fir,aU.y T are tolefcant and sympathetic to our religion. , rhey are a nation that governs wisely and its citizens obey and respect its laws witn contentment. ifrirdlv: The most important reason of all: Without any ulteripr motives Great Britain has come to our assistance and our belief and trust in her is the greater beceuse we know that no other motive underlies her action. Fourthly: I have read history and I also know myself that Great Britain has always been the protector of Mohammedan interests as for instance in the Crimean War. As opposed to this what has Germany done? And do you not know what Bismarck said as regards to Islam? Also Germany has taken four kilometres on either side of the Baghdad railway, a total making a country in itself, and forced the Turks to pay £1 a kilometre as a guarantee. ManyMany false rumours are going about E^rpt and other countries . ohamrnedans are those in whose hands are trust and confidence I as a Mohammedan will guard Islam and with the help of God I will continue to protect its interests. Tell the British Government that he is a friend who promises and fulfills that promise. I am a friend of the British Government what promises I have made and what I have undertaken I and my sons will with God’s help keep to the letter and while life is in us. A gentleman (Sherif) has one word and that word he will keep. And I hope that the British Government will according to its past history keep faith to the letter and keep inviolate the bonds between us in order that no evilly disposed persons will have an excuse to sow discord between us'. October We went to say good-bye. The Sherif said:- '1 am delighted you cane and I hope you will come again, If ever any friend or relation of yours comes be sure to let me know. I have had no chance through press of work of entertaining you as I would have wished. Give my respect to His Excellency the High Conrnissioner and to Wilson Pasha.** Note. The Sherif sent a present of £30 to the Indian orderlies. But Risaldar Major Gul Mawaz Khan explained that it was not customary and tactfully gave it back. The Sherif, however, gave both Indian officers prayer carpets large pieces of the Kiswa and various other small gifts.7o/ i| mm to mML On October the 9th we visited Abdulla. News had just come in from MEDINA about the successful action of Faisal's against the Turks at BIR ABBAS, He told us all about it and also about the destruction of the railway North of 1.1EDINA. I saidto him: 'I have a recomnendation to make which if it meets with your approval I hope you will mention to the Sherif, The various pilgrims who have come here from different countries have no knowledge of the real events which led to the present situation. Before they leave I suggest that you should call them together in 'Durban' and explain to them the facts you / consider it useful and necessary to carry away with them, for although they are poor and uneducated and ignorant yet when they return countless people will ask them about their experiences. First they will be extremely pleased at meeting the Sherif and secondly they will learn the true facts. I have an urdu translation of your proclamation and personally through my visit I have been able to understand the facts brought out in that proclamation,I have seen for myself the state of affairs and understand fully your aims and objects and your motives for taking the action you have so I will be able to exemplify and explain it.' Abdulla was very pleased with the idea saying it was a fortunate chance I had brought it up and that he would do his utmost to have it carried out. Ilote. The Sherif said it was sufficient to have the proclamation and have the people collected and the thing gone into for them. After a time Abdulla said:- 'Previous to these events we bad an alliance (Mohabat) with the Turks not because they were Turks hnt. because they were tiohanmedans, and as the Turkish GovernmentGovernment has ceased to uphold Mohamsuedanism and broken away from their faith so we have broken with them. The Koran is written and its . ictaten are in Arabic therefore we as Arabs are better able to gauge its true meanings. I hope therefore that otner f«iOjla-rnedans of the world will be pleased and content that the religious affairs of Islam are in the hands of the true and noole race of Aracs (in whose language the book they revere is written and in wnose country the Sacred Places of Mohammet are). I replied: 'Certainly they deserve our respect.' he continued : 'Because the HEJAZ was in the hands of the Turks and because Great Britain was at war with Turkey it would have been to the advantage of the British to invade the HEJAZ in order to attack the Turk bub out of respect to us and our religion they did not do so.'Gaidar ^.ior flul .' awaz'B Para onal Imr&gt;r a » H inn H I must lirat of all thank the British Government for their ^ kindness and assistance to us all and for selecting us for this visit - we greatly appreciate this fact and only hope that our visit may be of some service to the Government. We were delighted with all we saw, with our cordial reception by the bherif and for the success of the pilgrimage and the arrangements made to make it so. Our impression of the Sherif himself are that he is a man of the highest integrity and best ideals and I have every faith that he is to be fully relied on to act to the best of his ability in the highest motives both in the interests of his subjects and Islam as a whole. He personally sees to everything he possibly can, worke tremendously hard and has the greatest influence over his Arabs, who have absolute trust in him 8Jid yet foar him at the same time. 1 saw Arabs kissing every portion of him they could reach, although he tried to send them away, with the most unbounded affection. He makes no distinction in the way he treats people dealing courteously with poor and noble alike. I am oonvincod as a Mussulman, having learnt all I have and seen what 1 have seen that the Sherif did ri$vt to break away from the Turks, I consider it to be in the best interests of all Ifusaulmans to support him in his present endeavours. We were greatly struck with the amount of poor people in ' ecca the Shorif distributes £10 a day to the poor of the city and 7,0CC loaves of bread daily to the poor of the city, at the time of the blockade when food was scarce and prices high the Sherif shared the food of the poor, money is undoubtedly scarce in the city. The arrangements made for the comfort of the pilgrims were excellent considering the state of affairs, the pilgrims seemed very contentec and happy. From all accounts it was the greatest improvement on past pilgrimages. GulGul ' ftwaz’.,? Ideas of hoy the Visit might be turned to • Firstly: I can guarantee that I can instil the correct ideas into my own clan and its neighbours because from my heart I can say that I fully believe in the right of the Bherif* And when 1 tell ray people about the true state of affairs I know it will have a great effect on them. Secondly.:. 1 can tell you what the true feeling is among my clan, explaining to you the real deep rooted ideas that are causing dissention. Knowing this you will be better able to judge what line of action to take. Thirdly:. I propose that certain Llohanmedan gentlemen of India be invited to visit the Sherif and 1 am convinced this would have a good effect. Fourthly: I recommend the machine gun detachments proposed being sent from France, the Sherif needs them badly. Finally I do not pretend to influence the wide world with what I have seen and heard but as far as in me lies (not because I want to please the British (Government but because I firmly believe in the justice of the Sherif*s Cause) I will do ray best to make people realize the truth.££JSBAL French JI.aaiQfl. The French Mission was received in great state being met outside the city by the Sherif accompanied by a strong escort. They are staying with Ahmad Banamaji the richest man in MECCA and have a guard of honour on their premises. They had several audiences with the Sherif and were in his camp at ARAFAT and travelled there with him. Nearly everyone in MECCA spoke of the English with great favour fully acknowledging the help they had given. There was a rumour that 3,000 French had landed at RABEGH and that 9,000 were on their way, this was spoken of in quite a natural way and they spoke as if they wanted the British to land. s^tians,* Several men from Egypt whose names I have forgotten were speaking against the British and bolstering up the French. I would advise the Government to watch who they send. RaalaiOey. .sjaami, Rashid Bey Shami, editor, came to me two or three times and tried to find out what territories the Sherif would have after the war. I told him I was on a pilgrimage and knew nothing about these matters. Iba P-QQXa. I was greatly struck with the large numbers of poor in the city. The Sherif distributes 7,000 loaves of bread (beduin loaves) and £10 in cash daily to the poor. Indian Pi lgrims^ The chief reasons for feelings against the Sherif were firstly that though Mohammedans were fighting for Great Britain now Mohammedans were fighting Mohammedans, and that the Sherif had placed his affairs under control of the Christians who would seize his country.—In any further communica- yon on this subject, please quote no. w. 2 1 c l 3 aft d address The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, I,ondon. 12 L P 4617 191 6 r/ie Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the Undersecretary of State for ^ and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith. coffx^ of the uuder-tnentioned paper Foreign Office, , Sib Kef ere nee to previojjefxorrespondeuce to Letter , Forepm Oljice from Description of Inclosure.

(Addressed to Arab Bureau (Cairo), repeated to Foreign, and Secretary of State for India.) 4769. Sons of two well-to-do local inhabitants recently arrived here from Damascus, via Koweit. They were at college in Beyrout when war broke out; after remaining there for first year migrated to Damascus in January 1916 to await opportunity to cross to Iraq. As time went on, probability of them being impressed for military service became imminent, and they escaped on 12th July in Bedouin guise and reached Medina 11th Sep tember. From thence they joined large caravan to Koweit and arrived recently without special incident. Tewfik Ibn Faraoon emissary to Bin Saud, camel buyer, on behalf of Turks ( ? group omitted)-ed with same caravan and left it at Buraidah. He was believed to have 20,000 or 30,000 pounds with him. They report, Qasim Buraidah and Anaizah completely under control of Tj«*ks. Bin Rashid not thought likely to oppose Sherif but will more probably loot Ibn Faraoon on his way back in conjunction with northern Harb. Conditions in Syria deplorable, famine everywhere, and nothing but meat to be had. No troops at Damascus ; all had gone to Sinai ; people met with over (? “ joy ” omittedj-ed at Sherif’s rising. &lt; aoboIiBT tc &amp;&gt;►*and the mimerous raailins and every new scientific war material recently invented . naviiig not advanced nore t ian kilometres be sides beiig ar ; ed so strongly, the Turks shew that they are strongly opposed by our troops and tribes who are short of such recent war materials. Anyhow it is worthy of consideration and deep thought the fear that t ese tribes may get weary and tired of the long opposition against the enemy while they are away from their families, whom they have left without food , with no one else to give them rood . Therefore we have to repeat our request which we / have asked for 2 months ago nar ely the supply of a train ed disciplined force to help ours upon which they can rely and by means of which obey can defend themselves from the effects of the preparations of the enemy . iy this means \ there will be hope of success and victory in a short time and the men will be no more a i my from uhe means of obtain* ing their livelihood . jl The only cause of all this trouble is ‘fsdLiur 6 to )l break the railway decided in the contents of the Agreement Being quite certain of what I have explained before to Great Bri tain that the Turks are going to * ake their best to ortng the Holy Syrian Carpet in this pilgrimage reason, accompanied by the Emir whom they have appointed , I re repeat the request which I have asked for before* Thus I oeg a supply of at least 3 battalions , 2 of then to camp in Yanbo and the third in Habegh , for tills h e become of the utm dt importance. If se ding these battalions i roing to pe dif icult ad costly, this is the result of the delay of the advance towards the railway which should have ieeh done with the utmost 8 &gt;eed t I needI need not mention what was clearly said by the repres entative, who was accompanied by Hr ntorrs and Hussein the ship in Badee haroour Bouth of Jeddah before the ievolt took place by 5 days, namely that 16 9 0(X) soldiers and a reat number of aeroplanes were at our disposal . Therefore we Hast repeat our request which we have mentioned before this and to &amp;sk for a warship and 2 aeroplanes to stay at Vando and another to be at r*ab- egh until the above ne tionedforces arrive a id the Rail way is cut; this if Ireat Britain wishes to preserve us from the results of the rreneat condition of af fairs.

At the conclusion, however, of the cere&amp;onies attending3 / attending the it wee hie firm intention either to send hie son Abdalla to G&amp;iro, in order to get into touch with the authorities there, or elee to eoae down to Jedda himeelf in wh&amp;oh letter case, he hoped to be able to repair hie present omission* . 1 here took occasion to present the compliments and message* of H # &amp;, the high Commissioner, which hie “ighness returned with the greatest appreciation and cordiality, «e spoke aery muuii more hopefully Uvon his recent letters h»&lt;i led one to expect about the situation in the hij&amp;s, so much so, that at one Ktvment he threw oat a feeler deprecating the asoistanoe of the French Government, bailing to coc:prehend this allusion, i answered tuat God would doubtless give the victory to the forces of the true believers, a pious $enti&amp;ent leaving no reply other than titfU of unotuous assent, i-d’ter about SJO minutes most friendly , interesting and animated oonT«r«ati&lt;in I »«td i *&amp;• auro hit lunoh time a&amp;d arrived, and ,o gave bin the opportunity of ringing off, promialng to hid bin farewell before Reaving Jadda, in itb i’.uhi, ^ visited the bouee of the leading ierslan ef uebaa, « bahal, who hes rendered lie considerable service in providing infonsatlon himself, and also in protestin?, eome of our secret agents. 1 rods twice through the ba.aa.rs. etopping and toeing with some few of the merchants, and observing no more fanaticism than is to be found duriiig tne tourist •eason in the Cairo lh».*i. 1 Uunaramad Nasif, a prominent eitl.en of Aptian origin, who wae most anxious to obtain British nationality, and asxed a. point blan* wuat .. meant by dragging tn. ire oh into the country. binding ti^at there would hardly be another opportunity, 1 again rang up the Sherlf. «* ^ “ « 6odby * whi ° h B0,aeh0,, extended itself into a fair barter of an hour.

The big guns struck them so much that they could not at first believe tnem to be guns at all. Tne signalling and the loading drill impressed them no less, and the size, comfort and cleanliness of the Admiral*s cabin came in for admiring comment, -^ut it was the guns in the end waiou produced the greatest effect, and the party, after partaking of tea and performing their evening prayers upon the stern walk, left the ship in a state of mind divided between awe, and an intense satisfaction at having demonstrably espoused the winning cause. 1 was pleaseu to note that the greateat impression seemed to be produced upon the Sherif iiehein and Suleyman %abil, the most considerable and most intelligent aaesibers of the party, ihe former remarked 'tfhat we have s&amp;on is a representation, in little, of the great British inspire itself 11 and the latter informed me that he had not up till that moment realised that so large a ship could float upon uie surface of the waters.

Ihe evening’s amenities concluded with a display from 6 - B.lo p.m of the combined searorligxits of the British Bhips of War assembled in the harbour. H. S.aAEUCii. au-ix-io On rising, I gathered from ;tuhi t.-jtt there had been SO piisuziderstojiding with regard to the message from the Sherif Ali, delivered on our arrival by the interpreter of the 'Dufferin'. Tar from making any difficulties, Ali had prepar ed not on.Ly horses hut also Kuffiyas (head scarves) against the Sun for our benefit 4 He came aboard about 7-30; slight \ gentle, handsome and distinguished, a little under middle height, with n. wealdsh chin under a small pointed beard. He was dressed in a bl&amp;ck Abaya (cloak) silk Kuffiya and golden Aij aL (woollen scarfliolder); his very small and en.apely feet enclosed in Htambul Court Elastic*sided boots complete with rudimentary spurs, lie waa accompavnied by his military adviser for th rt time being, Hurl Bey of Baghdad;on«? of the Arab prisoners we have released from India, in khaki uniform and Kuffiya. We gave them coffee on the bridge, in the course of which i found Ali both courteous and agreeable Just before h we went ashore, and donned, with very remarkable effect, the red Auffiyas over our helmets. (It was of course manifest that these K.uffiyas had been provided less as a protection against the Hun tnan to shield till himself from hostile Arab criticism at the bringing of kelmeted Christians into the interior of the ilijaz). We then mounted our beatts and set off to inspect the lines of defence against a Turkish force .attempting to break through to J edda or he oca from edina. by . ;abugh, th e only practicable way. i left the Sherif Ali with ftuhi to the Admiral as much igunpwrw* as possible, but this was not much, for whenever I dropped back he would look about, turn round and cry “Why do you ride behind 0 * ister^ and beckon me back to hid side. We crossed a plain stretch of sand looking towards J'ebel Subh making for the right flank of the presumed Arab position, thence coming round the centre and returned by taeir hypothetical left wing the ride lasting from 8-15 to 11-50. The line (upon which as yet no stroke of work has been done) lies roughly astride qP tne Sultan# Ho&amp;d from j edina to Habughj and snip s guns at7000 yds range could certainly cover the flanics by d&amp;»?t being supposed that the Turks could scarcely venture on attempting to slip through the intermediate belt of palm groves (aoout 4800 yds range) by night. in the course of a long, but necessarily somewhat disjointed conversation with the Sherif Ali, I was aston ished to find that he had not yet heard of the death of herd Kitchener, in spite of an elaborate letter we had sent to his father. He observed with truth that he had been in the desert more than three months and had seen no news- papers, a ueiecc we must lose no tine in repairingj (l h.ad already made a start in this direction with fifty of my Arabic haemakers mitigated by 500 fresh Egyptian cigarettes Tue Sherif seems to srao^e almost without interruption). X explained to him our grave reluctance at sending British troops even to the coast of the Hijaz and he seemed to agree that from the Arab point of view it would be, save under imperious necessity, a heavy blunder. He said that three batteries of quxcjt firing guns, one for defence, and two for a possible advance against Medina would suffice them. Unlike huri, who is fair at French, and lias had the energy to pick up in India a smattering of English, Ali knows nothing but Arabic, in which he shows signs of being a fine scholar. On the whole he appears to have more chax*m than strength of character; and I consider him distinctly inferior in grip and decision to his younger brother Abdalia, undoubtedly the ruling spirit of the clan. We passed the red standard of Jfecca flying over the tents because it was Triday, and dismounted at the shore.In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No. W.

He proceeded to destroy the railway in various places dividing his force into three parties, one close to Medina another at OUhMISH ( 10 kilo ietres North of Media*), and the third at MFIiU (40 miles north of Medina), hie object being to capture the Forts at BOUT and HAFIM, Jventually he was forced to abandon this idea since each night the Turks repaired the danago done with the aid of Construction and ar soured trains against which he could not compete.

Sarly:arly In July he was only a few miles from Godina and saw the ' urklrh reinforcements ar riving. He and ALI consulted together as to whether they would remain where they were or retire since the turka were beginning to coie out of iedlna they decided to remain hoping that Airms and Guns would be sent before the Turks really attacked. At this time they had three 0«mj&gt;S of 10,000 Arabs each, but not one camp had 2,000 good rifles. About the middle of July the Turk* began to attack and heavy fighting occurred for most of the day until the Arabs had no am- muiition left. All then ordered s retirement to OHaDIR RAGEH ( about fourteen miles ^outh of Medina )• Soon afterwards five-hundred Japanese rifles arrived which they could not use, ?s the am unit!on sometimes did not fit and many were broken.

Secret. Arab revolt. War Office recently suggested possibility of influencing Indian Moslem opinion through well-chosen native officers. Risaldar-Major Gul Mawaz Khan, 18th Cavalry, now on leave from France, who is most favourably spoken of by his Commanding Officer, has since been interviewed here. He is confident that Arab case can be so successfully presented to mass of Indian Moslems that political agitation will be powerless. Otherwise they will hear only pro-Turkish side and will naturally believe it. He suggests, first, that 10 or 12 native officers in France should take leave and go to Hedjaz in two’s or three’s. They would see for themselves, be received by Grand Sherif, and then go to their homes in India and talk. Second, that Grand Sherif should publish proclamation to Moslem world countersigned by Arab notables, and that deputation of Arab notables should visit India, with facsimilies of proclamation, and either hold meetings, or at all events be available to explain Arab case to those concerned. First suggestion seems worth trying. It would be purely private arrangement and commit no one. If you agree, and McMahon sees no objection, I would approve it at once. Regarding second I am more doubtful, and should be glad of your views. Deputation must of course be well received by officials, and might need protection.
