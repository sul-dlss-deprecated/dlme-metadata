I Kv FOREIGN OFFICK, S.W.I. 5th October, 1938. Sir, I am directed 'by Viscount Halifax to request you to inform the Air Council that the Saudi Arabian Minister called at the Foreign 0 flee on the 16th SeptemV. r and said that he had received instructions from King Abdul Aziz to make a com junioation to His Majesty*s Oorernment in the following sense. 2. King Abdul Aziz had lately been asked by His Majesty's Oovernment on more than one occasion for permission for aircraft to pa^n over ?;audi Arabian territory. Kinc Abdul Aziz had for his own part no objection at all to givin . permission and was only too glad to be able to assist His Majesty 's Gove n lent in such matueru. Unfortunr ely, the passage of such aircraft was noticed by his subjects, among v /hom w re tribesnien w^iose knowledge of the outer world was small end whose suspicion of all things foreign was considerable. Although holdin, no sympathy with the views of such persons, King Abdul Aziz was bound to take into account their criticisms, irfiich were to the efiect that the pat sage of aircraft was a sign that he had sold his country to the British and that prrmlsslon ought not to be granted. In these circumstanoes. His Majesty's Govern cnt would avoid placing Kin, Abdui Aziz in an embarrassing situation if they were to make requests for permission for flights by aircraft on very rare occasions only. 3. The Saudi Arabian Minister was informed that the message/ The Seor&lt; tary of the Air Ministry.P. Z.7314/38. 41 Enclosure in Air Ministry covering letter No.S.44349/S.6. dated 26th October,1938.

The first, taking place in January 1942, involved the forced landing of an Royal Air Force (RAF) Blenheim aircraft at El Khabur or Al Khobar [Al Khubar] in Saudi Arabia, and the subsequent presentation by British officials to the Shaikh of Al Khubar of a silver tray, in recognition of the assistance given by him and his people. Photographs of the tray and its inscription are found on folios 10A-10C. A second incident, involving the emergency landing of three RAF Hurricanes in salt marshes at Ras es Safaniyah [Safaniyah] in April 1942, led to negotiations with Ibn Saud, and subsequent efforts by the Political Agent in Kuwait and CASOC representatives to first retrieve the pilots and then salvage the planes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Air accidents</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000091#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
