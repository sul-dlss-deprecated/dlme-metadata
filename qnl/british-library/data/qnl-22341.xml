V, e Castmt INCORPORATED IN ENGLAND.) 6th May. ( PNroflPW^ L* Dear Albaa, With reference to your P*0. letter ffo. 0/406 of the 6th of May v the position, yesterday that caused us to refuse to accept notes of any tetmiaatlou was that the market had been flooded by merchants bringing notes from Basra end Kuwait and exporting silwer against them, presumably to finance the purchase of soterelgns in Kuwait. In order to control this outflow of emus, we found it necessary to refuse to accept notes, except at a discount of three percent, the east of replaclpe the silwer leaving Bahrain. this morning. In order that confidence In the stability of the Indian Government should not be impaired, we agreed to ecespt from the Public notes at par. fs were, however, unable to accept one thousand-rupee notes as these we not disposable In the local market. How we understand you ere placing a ban upon the export of gold and silver from here and it will therefore be no longer necessary for us to place any restriction on the negotiability of notes, with the exception of A- ^ V notes of Rs.l.OOOA# k Major R.0«K.W. Alban, Political Agent, Pdhrair.6 th May, 1941., loth Rahia.II.136o., THE CUSTOMHOUSE: BAHRAIN: I thank you for your D.O.N 0 .C /408 of* this date which relates to the Customs' non-acceptance of Indian currency notes. 2. Since each day’s Customs collections are lodged with The Eastern Bank Ltd., it did not seem feasible to accept from the public notes which the Bank declined to accept from the Customs. This applied particularly to one-rupee notes; and I understand that this procedure was adopted by the Bank to conserve the supply of silver currency in circulation in Bahrain, as the Bank had very good reason to believe that certain dealers ^in currency were buying in Iraq and Kuwait at a discount Indian currency notes which were encashed here in silver, which silver (or gold in some instances) was re-exported back to Iraq and Kuwait where it is believed that the bullion and specie came into the hands of the enemy. 3* The Eastern Bank Ltd., has now decided to accept from the Customs all Indian currency notes which come into its collections; so there is no need now in this Department to refuse same from the Public. 4. It ought, however, to be mentioned that,according to local custom of long standing, only Indian silver coins are legal tender in the State of Bahrain, although local trading is done in other currencies and in Indian notes. 5. In view of the fact that the British Government has to-day expelled Iraq from the sterling bloc, I would suggest the suitability of the Government of Bahrain prohibiting the export hence of gold or silver in bullion or specie; and would ask you, if you approve, for an Order to this effect under the Emergency Order issued by The Hon*ble The Resident in the Persian Gulf soon after the outbreak of'war, please.

No. C/749-9A Bahrain, May 6, 1941 r Dear Alban Reference your D.0.C/393-9/10 dated 1st May. I have considered the matter and discussed it today with Shaikhs Abdullah and Sulman. We agree that there is no possible objection to the restriction on the export of gold. The Shaikhs thought of suggesting this some months ago. Regarding silver. The shaikhs fear that any restriction would injure our trade with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait which now that there is trouble in * Iraq will be more essential than before. They see no objection to permits being obtained for export of large quantities of silver or notes by post, plane or steamer but they think that small sums should be allowed to be taken out without any restriction too facilitate normal trade transactions. I explained the object of the regulation, which they understand, and have assured them that genuine commercial transactions will not be delayed or interfered with. Yours sincerely Major R. G. E. W.

No. of 1360 Office of £he Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 7th Rajah, 1360 July 30, 1941. His Britannic Majesty f s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum:- For some time during the disturbances in Iraq and Syria the export of specie from Bahrain, including silver, was prohibited except with a special permit. This action was taken in order to prevent specie reach ing enemy hands. Since the restriction was withdrawn a new position has arisen which is resulting in large quantities of silver being exported from Bahrain to such an extent that if it continues there is liable to be a shortage of rupee silver currency in the bazaar. I understand that Kuwaiti merchants buy Iraq Dinars in Kuwait at Rs.12 and exchange them in Basra for a draft on Bombay at 75J fils per rupee, e.g. they buy I.D. 1,000 in notes in Kuwait for Rs.12,000 and buy a draft on Bombay for Rs.12,000 in Basra at a cost of I.D. 906. Profit on this transaction is I.Drs. 94. They then sell Bombay funds in Bahrain Rs.12,000 for silver at 2% discount, losing R«. 240 or I.D. 18 on this transaction, but the net profit on the whole transaction is I.D. 94 - I.Drs.18 = I.Drs. 76 on every I.D.1,000 = 7.6 per cent. With the silver obtained in Bahrain they commence the operation over again in Kuwait. Practically no rupees are being paid into the Bank in Bahrain, almost all the payments into the Bank by 2 /2 merchants are Saudi riyals or Indian currency notes. The Bank does not wish to bring silver from India at its own expense in order to finance merchants who are dealing in transactions of this type. I should be grateful if an enquiry could be made from Kuwait as to what is happening to the large amount of silver which is being imported there from Bahrain and if the reply substantiates the facts mentioned in this memorandum it would, I think, be desirable to limit the export of rupees from Bahrain to Kuwait to that which is needed for genuine trade transactions. Adviser to the G-overnment. S.Z. -Confidential No.C/811-9/10. Political Agency, Bahrain, the 5th August 1941. To The Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain. Memoranddm Reference your memorandum No. 1433/9A dated July 30th. 2. The new order on the subject of export of gold, rupees etc. enables us to check the bona fides of each proposed export before issue of a licence. It will also enable us to obtain statistics as to the actual quantity of silver exported to Kuwait, among other places. 3. I suggest that at first we see what are the amounts involved, while v/atching for any abnormal exports, not attributable to bona fide trade. 4.

Kuwait on passing Bahrain, with copy to Political Resident and P#/« Bahraini at Ferechi* It is reported by the lv!anager of Eastern Bank Limited, iA«! Bahrain, that a steady drain on silver rupees from Bahrein to Kuwait Is taking place. He says that Iraqi dinars can be bought in Kuwait at a considerable discount? but for silver U. rupees only, not for notes* 2* Bahrain merchants therefore send shipments of rupee silver to Kuwait, where they buy cheap dinars. ?hey then send these dinars by cor to Basra, where they buy rupees (notes) at par? or else buy drafts to replace their Bahrain branches in funds. The bank*a commission on these draft© is much lass than the profit they make on the transaction in Kuwait. u)l ^ • ' fr® result of this is that the Manager of the Eastern Bank is running short of silver rupees, and thinks he will * soon hove to send for more, the branch therefore losing the y cost of shipping and insurance from Bombay. J! 1 put, it to him that, leaving branch considerations aside, the Reserve Bank was in any case obliged to maintain a u 3U PPly of rupees in Kuwait, and no harm was done if obliging ^ persons undertook the Bahrain-Kuwait portion of the freight o - and risk. He thinks, however, that the money is merely going 'into the old stocking' in Kuwait, and not remaining in cir culation. 5. One can understand holders of rupees buying dinars when Can a profit, but I tried to Imagine to myself exactly why holders of dinars in Kuwait, should be content to sell \ their dinars at a discount there instead of putting them in a / carcar and taking then to Basra, where thsy can get faoa value, X take it that the dinar holders are refugees from Iraq, who have lost confidence In Iraqi currency, and want to get in on the Indian currency, even at an immediate loss* 6* There is also the point that in Basra one can, I believe, only get Indian currency notes? whesees these dinar sellers insist on rupees.

Reference ay preceding note on the subject of the suspected drain of rupees from Bahrain to Kuwait. X have obtained the following further information, which you may in due course be able to confirm or comment on. 2. At the time of the beginning of the Iraqi revolt, certain Kuwaiti shroffs had large credits in their Indian branches, with which to buy sovereigns for smuggling purposes. The sovereign, however, then fell to Hs. 31/- in Kuwait and the equivalent in Irani currency of Rs. 35/- in Basra. As it was then Rs. 28/- in India, the smuggling proposition lost its attractiveness. (The sovereign, as you know, reached Rs. 50/- and over in Bahrain in the summer of 1940). As these shroffs now want to clear out some of their credits in India, one can buy drafts on India in Kuwait much more cheap- ly than in Basra* 3. Kuwaiti merchants who go in for 'musabila' are naturally always getting gold and silver riyals from the Beduin. The riyois are said to be sent to Bahrain for realization into rupees. The gold is taken to Basra, and with it dinars are brought back to Kuwait and with them drafts on India are bought* The discount on this lest transaction is 8 but tK. ^ c-in or: sending gold to Basra more than mekes up fov this# ( ;s# 31A 111 Kuwait and Rs. 35/- in Basra, i*e. Bs. 4/- on eveiy 3 , 31/- » about 13 %• Net profit on the two Journeys 5 %) ^he resultant credit in India, of course, buys more goods for sale to the Beduin. 4. If this is correct, it means, I think, that Iraqis are so keen to hold sovereigns that they don’t mind the -tuaitis r aking 5 % out of them* It also means that it is probable /-probable that whenever we give a permit from here for emport of sovereigns to uwalt, they merely go into an Iraqi stocking. 6 . I gather that tho cycle continues as follows The shroffs In Kuwait who have sold the drafts on India, find themselves holding dinars. They take these to Basra where they buy Indian currency notes (now brought there In plenty by the troops )| they bring these back to Kuwa! t, where they sell them at a net profit of ^ to £ 3. (This^of course, becomes worth while when they are dealing in lakhs). The note-holders take them down to Bahrain, where the Sastem Bank was, until recently, giving silver for notes. (I am trying to watch imports of notes} but they do not all, I suspect, appear in the Customs books). Rupees are now quoted at Re. 10l£ to Ra. 100 in notes. 6 . Since drafting the above five paragraphs, I have received your predecessors telegram No. 515 of August 14th, in which he speaks of a shortage of silver in Kuwait. I find that Bahrain exported Ra. 75,000/- to Kuwait in July, «nd I have issued export permits for a further total of Rs.75,000/- inthe first fortnight of August; so I should be interested to know what you think to be the reason for this shortage. 17.8.41Confidential No.C/835-9/10 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 17th August 1941 To The Adviser to the Bahrain Government Bahrain Memorandum Reference your memorandum No.l433/9A dated the 30th July 1941. 2.

I am looking into a case in which it is suspected that the recipient of a licence for export by air to Basra , sold it to another person at a rate of Rs. 25/- per Rs. 1000/- (the licence was for Rs. 8000/-); and the latter is believed to have used it for export by launch to Kuwait (licence No, 18). ( N.B . The profit of Rs. 200/- made might be bornw in mind if it should later be decided to prosecute, and a fine is to be awarded)• 4. A slightly dishbnest declaration was made by an a )plicant who asked to send Rs. 10,000/- for purchase of dates by launch to ’’Basra via Kuwait”, and who sent instructions to his agent in Kuwait to have the money changed into dinars there (licence No. 21 ). 1 am following this up, but strong action is not desirable or possible. 5, Compardtive statistics of mpee exports, note imports and gold exports are as follows s-1940 - 1941• JUly 1941.

T. Report No* 2* We have now been able to obtain more ample information regarding the smuggling of gold sovereigns. Our informant has approached ABDULLAH ZILHA, principal of the Bank Zilha (just returned from Lebanon) who gave him the following details. Incidentally, It may be mentioned that ZILHA has a wide knowledge and experience on this matter. He stated that it was an absolute fact that the drop, at the end of May 1940, of the Sterling gold sovereign, was due to the smuggling of this specif out of India. This smuggli g was carried out in the following way: Gold sovereigns were bought in Bombay (at the rate of about P.T.200 to the pound), secretly sent to Kuett and Bahrain and from there to Iraq. After having left India, this move did not present any diffici Ity as there are no restrictions for the import of gold and gold sovereigns in Iraq. However, it is stated that some important people including even members of the Government of Ira^t mutt have been connected with these operations. Statistics issued bj the Irakian Customs show that 250,000 gold sovereigns were imported into Iraq in April and May last. From Iraq, this gold was sent to Syria. It may be of interest to note that in January 1940 the gold sovereign was worth on the Egyptian market about P.T.200, in February, bankers coming from Syria began to buy gold in Cairo and made it rise gradually to P.T.440 . (May .1940). This rise was said to be due to the smuggling of gold sovereigns to Syria and Lebanon where it was much in demand and attained at one moment the rate of P.T.6^^ From the last days in May 1940, the soverei^ ^ ?) again to about P.T.225. Ai • c At present, there is some indicating pointing towards the revival of contraband of gold, as the soverign in India is quoted at P.T.205, and in Egypt, today, at P.T.300 • in Lebanon and Syria, probably even more. According to ZILHA, this contraband will not be done on a large scale before the price in Syria of gold sovereigns reaches at least P.T.400. At that minimum price, all expenses are covered and an interesting profit is left to the smuggler. From a different source, it has be n said th t the price of gold sovereign may rise in Egypt by the fact th t after the occupation of Cyrenaica, the Arabs, who h-ve been depossessed of their gold by the Italians, are now trying to obtain gold at any price, creating thus a large demand.2/- GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN.

Memorandum:- Reference your memorandum No.C/835-9/10 dated the 17th August, 1941. Ibrahim Noono obtained license No. 18 from the Political Agency to export Rs.8,000/- to Iraq by plane. The permit was altered and initialed at the Agency for export by steamer instead of by air. Ibrahim Noono produced a shipping bill, at the Customs, for the export of Ra.8,000/- to Kowait by launch of Nakhuda Musa bin Abdulla. As he held a permit to export this sum from Bahrain he was given permission to export the silver. The export should have been held up in order to ascertain why the silver was sent to Kowait by launch instead of to Basra by steamer. Regarding Hajeeh bin Ali al A f war, this man left by steamer on the same day to Kowait. 7/hen he left his baggage was searched by the Police and no money was found on him. The Police also searched the launch on which Ibrahim Noono’s Rs. 8,000/- was sent and checked the amount. V/e have no means of connecting the Ra. 8,000/- sent by Ibrahim Noono to Kowait with Hajeeh bin Ali al A 1 war although the fact that Hajeeh bin Ali and the money both went to Kowait, by different means of travel, is sus picious.There is at present nothing to prevent persons in Bahrain getting other people to send silver on their behalf to Iraq or Kowait.

As you are probably aware neither the Shaikh nor the people of Qatar agree to accept notes except in circumstances agreeable to them, Our labourers invariably insist on being paid in silver and it is necessary for us to export some Rs 20,000/- monthly.

DIRECTOR OF CUSTOMS AND PORT OFFICER,BAHRAIN Enclosure :I made enquiries regarding currency add the result is as below:- Dinars bought in Kuwait at Rs. 12/12/** each and exchanged at Basrah for Indian currency notes at the fixed Bank rate of 75 fils a rupee (i-e. ,Ps. 13/5/4). The difference thus gained amounts to 43/12 per thousand. The Indian notes are brought to Kuwait and sold for rupee coins at from 25 to 35 per thousand below par thus a net profit of from 3/12 to 18/12 per thousand is made. The rupee coins remain in Kuwait but are not exposed to an outward observer as they are kept in safes of merch nts at their offices and in their houses. Indian currency notes are treated as a fluctuating commodity and rupee coins as the stable currency. Saudi riyals and sovereigns are brought in large amounts from ~audi Arabia to Kuwait for the purchase of goods Therefore Saudi riyals are accepted at Annas 15/- or thereabouts each, and brought to Bahrain where they are sold for rupee coins at a discount of about Fs.5/- per thousand, thus a net profit of about Rs.50/- per thousand is made. I understand that the Customs have recently been keeping a record of imports of Saudi riya^sIn continuation of Captain Howaa 1 note of 19th August the following are comparative statistics of Rupee and Gold exports and of note imports during August and the first fort night dfl September in 1941 and 1940, (a) Eigures as from Lic ences issued in Agency .

(Deficiencies and surplus are marked *) The original figure of gold exports during 1st-15th *dgust 1941 was incorrect and should be as above* 8 lakhs of these were the value of one consignment only of gold sovereigns /-- 2 - I l ! 4 t sovereigns in direct transit to Saudi Arabia for the King. Deficiencies are due to s ome licences not being used and the one surplus is explained by the fact that since there is no time limit to a licence some licences issued, say, early in August have not been used until September. It would increase the accuracy of our statistics if a time limit of a fortnight were imposed. The above figures, if correct, give rather a start- . a ling picture. (I say if correct as A.O. is of the opinion that there is considerable evasion). The licensing system was introduced as a result of a heavy drain of silver rupees out of Bahrain, and yet it appears that these exports are only one-fifth or less of what they were last year. Since the licensing system was not intended to be a definite res triction, it appears that either it has so become in practice or the drain of rupees was over-estimated. But, as will be shown, I do not agree with either of these prima facie con clusions. The position in Kuwait also offers an apparent contra diction. P.A. Kuwait has reported a shortage of silver rupees but our records show we have issued licenses for the export of Hs./, yo o /^to that State. At the same time, 98 silver rupees will buy a hundred rupee note in Kuwait but our figures do not show that the obvious and profitable trans action of exporting rupees and importing notes is taking place to any axtent. (A rupee note is at par in Bahrain). A.O. gives me to understand that the silver rupees are hoarded by Kuwaiti merchants in their houses and offices and are used to purchase Saudi Hyals, at 16 annas for one ryal. The ryals are then exported to Bahrain and changed back into silver rupees at a loss of £ % 9 making a net profit on /-on 'th© transaction of about 5 and ttie cycle begins again* The silver rupee - ryal transaction is therefore more profitable than the rupee /- silver rupee exchange end it would be interesting to know if the Saudi Government is finding itself short of ryals and long of silver rupees^ though I doubt if this position could ever be ascertained at all accurately* The Bahrain Customs have not been asked to keep any special watch on the import of Saudi ryals but the Director is looking up his ordinary records tosee if there has been any increase in these imports recently* I am/informed that a licence for, say, Hs. 10,000/- is used to cover the export of twice that sum* Whether this is true or not,, the temptation to smuggle certainly seems too strong to be resisted and I am forced to the conclusion that our figures are inaccurate and that no reliable conclusions can be drawn from them* Gold exports show an increase, which is easily explained by the fact that the price of gold in Iraq is higher than in Bahrain.MZ /07 Telegram , Code.

From March, 1941, to date, the Bank has imported 6,10,000 silver rupees from India, and from January to date, we have imported Rs*7^ lass of Indian currency notes. Prior to March, 1941, we had on hand about 10 lacs of silver, but practically all this was withdrawn from the Bank, and, I believe, eventually found its way to Kuwait. I do not think that the drain of silver rupees has caused any dislocation of trade. There is a fair quantity of notes in the bazaar, and these are accepted readily by all and sundry, since the law was passed making Indian currency notes legal tender in Bahrain. I do not think there is a glut of notes, as I believe afairly larga quantity of notas, chiafly of 100-rup«« danoaina- tlons, ar® shipped to India. Thare is a aonsidarable quantity of Saudi Arabian Riyala in the bazaar, and during the past year we hare exchanged about 25 lass of Saudi Riyals. With regard to the gold position, today*8 price of soTtreign: is Rs.40.8.0, whereas the price in Iraq is I.Drs.3/450. This, calculated at lsh.6d. to the rupee (1 dinar • £1), makes the price of sovereign in Iraq today Rs.46. I know for certain that there are 5,000 sovereigns in the bazaar, and another 2,000 could probably be raised from various small merchants. Therefore, I do not think it would be any exaggeration to state that today’s stock of sovereigns in the bazaar is about 7,000. All these sovereigns are intended for expert te Basra, and merchants are only awaiting their import licences from the Iraq authorities. As soon as these licences are obtained, I am quite sure the rate of sovereigns here will appreciate by four or five rupees. I de not know the reason for the demand fer sovereigns in Iraq, but they are probably being used as a safe form ef investment. I hope the above information will be of some use to you. If I have omitted anything, kindly let me knew. Kind regards, /THE CUSTOMHOUSE BAHRAIN: 18th December, 194-1*, 29th Dhul Qasda, 1360., H # B.

Alban, 0*B.E*, Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your memorandum No. 84-S dated the 13th October 1941 requesting a report on the working of the licensing order in Bahrain. 2. The proposal was put forward on receipt of a report by his Majesty 9 • Consul, Damascus, to the effect that the Germans were buying small offerings of gold pounds and that newspapers there stated that fresh supplies were being sent from Bahrain via Iraq, please see my memorandum No. C/279 dated the 29th March 1941. Enquiries made locally revealed that in the period 1st March 1940 to 1st March 1941 something like 65,000 gold sovereigns had been exported to Iraq from Bahrain and that practically all these sovereigns had come from Saudi Arabia and India. During the above period the price of a sovereign had risen to fa 50/- in Bahrain against a usual steady price of fe 28/29 in India and it was assumed that purchases on account of German buyers were keeping up the demand. 3. In the meantime it began to be noticed that large numbers of Indian currency notes were arriving in Bahrain from Basra and Kuwait for exchange into silver rupees which were shipped back to Kuwait for the alleged purpose of purchasing gold for the enemy, and the market was running short of silver as a consequence /-(n* - 2 - consequence, see my memorandum No. C/416 dated the 7th May 1941. An addition was therefore made in the draft licensing order to include silver rupees and bullion. 4. The licensing order was introduced from the beginning of August 1941 and the results of four months of its opera tion are shown in the attached enclosure *A M . It will be seen that in the four months of operation this Agency issued 133 export licences for 39,9^0 gold sovereigns, 4,63,303 silver rupees, 7,42,750 9§udi Kiyals, 1654 tolas of gold bullion and 1500 tolas of silver bullion, also an assortment of M.T. dollars, French dollars and Iranian Tomans. The important items are sovereigns, gold bullion and silver rupees and of the above amounts, 14,730 sovereigns were intended for Iraq and 25,000 for Arabia (including Kuwait), the small balance went to other destinations. Of the gold bullion, 1419 tolas went to Itfaq and the small balance to other destinations. Of the rupees licensed for export, fts 3,09,150 went to Kuwait; Rs 16,000 to Iraq and Rs 53,923 to Arabia, the balance to other destinations. In the same period Rs 1,57,880 value of Indian currency notes were imported into the Island. 5. From the Customs figures it appears that during the year 1941, up to and including November, the following values in rupees of gold and silver (figures approximate only) were exported from Bahrain to Persian Gulf ports Sovereigns Gold bullion Rs te Silver rupees. Rs Silver bullion Indian and miscellaneous currency notes Rs Rs 34,43,860 98,220 6,86,820 67,02,050 3,40,740 Rs/- Of this, sovereigns and gold bullion to the value of Rs 23,18,900 went to Arabia and Kuwait and Rs 12,23,180 to Iraq. Of the 6,86,820 silver rupees exported,(irt' •%. - 3 - 2,88,650 went to Arabia, Rs 3,90,170 to Kuwait and Rs 8,000 to Iraq and of the Ps 67,02,050 value of silver bullion, Rs 64,16,850 went to Arabia, Rs 2,67,000 to Kuwait and Rs 18,200 to Iraq. ^ \^f\ 6. I enclose a copy of a letter from Mr. Gunn, Manager of the Eastern Bank, Bahrain, on the present money situation from which it will be seen that the situation as regards silver rupees and notes is satisfactory. As regards gold, it is said that since the Iraq Government have imposed restrictions on the movements of gold it is no longer finding its way into enemy hands and so presumably the export to Iraq which continues at about the average level, is being used for investment purposes. 7. The state of the money market is now normal, in as far as war time conditions permit, and, after consultation with the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and the Manager, Eastern Bank, I think and they agree, that there is no reason to continue the export restriction order on gold , and silver passed by me under Regulation No. 1 of 1940 on the 30th July 1941 as sanctioned by you, vide your telegram i No. T/315 dated the 25th JUly 1941. v J) 'W I therefore suggest that I b4 authorised to cancel my above order and to inform the Bahrain State accordingly for similar action on their part.

It has been reported that gold sovereigns are b^ing smuggled into Bahrein in a steady stream, much of it being later exported to this country. It is known that this year in the first eight days of February 19,750 gold sovereigns, 50 Turkish gold Liras ana 1,000 ounces pf bar gold were imported into 'Iraq. There is a strong and increasing demand for gold here as an investment, out at present the price is higher in Turkey and Persia. The 'Iraqi control has granted no licence for the export of gold to m urkey or any other country, therefore smuggling may be expected. It would be an advantage to prohibit the export of c^old x x om Bahrein uo ' Iraq is this could be done without leading to extensive smuggling from Bahrein and other places in the Persian Culf.Proceedings and Conclusions of a Conference held on the 28t*h February 1942 'to discuss measures for preventing the smuggling of gold and silver out of Bahrain consequent on the tightening of restrictions on export.

The Political ‘.gent foresaw that if the issue of export licences was curtailed there would be a great increase in the smug-ling Ox gold and he invited the co-operation of the Bahrain Government in preventing this. He pointed out that there were adequate penalties under the law to penalise offenders• 4 0 The Adviser considered that no harm would be done to Bahrain interests by the prevention of this gold traffic: ojie only persons affected would be one or two bullion brokers v.ho were Jraqi subjects, o. Ir. Gunn, Uanager of the eastern Bank, stated that the export of gold as such from Bahrain did not affect his oank. He was more interested in preventing the flow of rupee silver cut of Bahrain. This was exported from Bahrain ■oo pay for the gold finding its way from Saudi Arabia into xraq. Aupee notes not being accepted in Arabia^ large quanti ties of rupee coin were being drained from Bahrain leaving2 rupee notese G. Ghe prevention of smuggling was next discussed. The problem was considered to be practically confined to preventing export to Kuwait by countrycraft, but to be peculiarly dinicult owing to the physical features of the island of Bahrain* 7. The Director of Customs considered that one of the main difficulties in convicting smugglers was the fact that smugglers could afford to pay large bribes to the customs guards vvhereas the rewards for obtaining convictions in the courts were inadequate. Be argued that the courts should, as a matter of practice, ordinarily award half the line levied on convicted smugglers as a reward to the oer- sons apprehending them. The Political Agent agreed to instruct the Agency courts, and the Adviser the Bahrain courts, accordingly. c. Further practical measures v/ere considered to be increased activity by the Bahrain police launch patrol round the coasts oi the island, and of the mounted oolice patrol on the north west shores of the island; coupled with arrangements with Kuwait for the search of ships on arrival from Bahrain. 3* The export of silver to Kuwait and Iraq was next con- siaered. ihe Political Agent stated that he aid not wish to prohibit the export entirely but to limit it to the amounu required for the ilnance of bona fide trade only* export oi silver to Iraq was considered to be unnecessary. I-i. aq noes not recognise rupee currency and trade transac tions can be paid for through the Eastern Bank. The con ference agreed that permission for the export of rupee silver to Iraq should not be given.

These instructions have been carried out. There was, however, at the time when these instructions were issued, a considerable amount of gold in stock with Bahrain bullion brokers, some of whom had contracted to send gold to Iraq* As these holdings of gold were legitimate, and as their con tinued existence in Bahrain would be an incentive to smuggling, I have permitted the export to Iraq of this gold after verifying that it is actually held by the brokers con cerned and was acquired by them specifically for export. The amount of gold involved is 3850 sovereigns and 900 ozs. of bar gold. 3 .

I enclose a note written by my Accounts Clerk which tells the story of the rupee. Briefly it is:- Dinar notes arrive in Kuwait to buy gold from the Hedjaz and as the sellers of gold want silver the notes are sold for rupees. Buyers of dinar notes take them to Basrah and purchase bank drafts on Bombay and Karachi. Drafts are negotiated in Bahrain for rupees or rials which are represented as proceeds of sale of goods and export licence is obtained and rupees arrive in Kuwait and the circle commences again. A nice profitable business. I suggest requests for export permits of rupees to Kuwait be very strictly scrutinised. .Wakefield, Esquire, I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain.^ Copy of a note written by the Accounts Clerk, Political Agency, Kuwait. I have made enquiries regarding the use of silver rupees imported from Bahrain and have so far obtained the following information:- The silver imported from Bahrain is not used for bona fide trade transactions as there is not much trade between Bahrain and Kuwait. Most of the merchants in Kuwait are dealing in different currencies available in Kuwait i.e. Iraq Dinars, Saudi Rials and Sovereigns. They purchase Iraq Dinars in Kuwait at a discount which varies almost every day and take them to Basrah from where they obtain bank drafts on Bombay or Karachi on payment of a nominal discount. These bank drafts are not sent to India because export of gold and silver is prohibited there but are sent to Bahrain from where the silver is imported into Kuwait. The Kuwait merchants are doing this exchange regularly and are making good profits out of it. The other use to which the silver imported into Kuwait is put is as under:- Purchase .of Gold and Silver. Ever since the trade restrictions between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have been removed large quantities of gold and silver are pouring into Kuwait from Saudi Arabia. In return $)f their gold and silver the Saudis take back with them rice, sugar, tea etc., and the balance in silver rupees which are again brought into Kuwait for further purchases. The gold thus imported into Kuwait finds its way to Iraq where the demand is ever increasing. The gold is purchased by the Iraqis either through there agents in Kuwait or is smuggled into Iraq. All the silver exported to Iraq from Bahrain is thus brought into Kuwait to pay for the cost of Sovereigns they purchase here. As the Iraqis do not possess enough silver rupees the remainder of the payments are made in Iraqi Dinars which/- 2 - which are accepted in Kuwait only at a discount. The value of Iraq Dinars in Kuwait fluctuates with the rise and fall in the value of Sovereigns. If the value of sovereigns goes up the value of Iraq Dinars goes down and vice versa. By this transactior a small percentage of silver rupees goes to Saudi Arabia and Iraq but eventually it is brought back into Kuwait. It was only in the second half of 1940 that large quantity of silver rupees as well as Indian Currency Notes was exported to India in order to purchase Sovereigns from there. At that time the price of Sovereign in Kuwait went upto Ks.60/- whereas the price of sovereign in India was only fo.28/-. Most « of the merchants in Kuwait closed their business here and collected all the possible silver rupees and notes which they took with thou to India and brought back rather smuggled out of India large number of sovereigns. It was stopped only when a few of them were caught by the customs authorities in India and were duly punished. The chief use to which the silver rupees in Kuwait are put is hoarding. Before the outbreak of hostilities in September, 1939 the Indian Currency Notes and Iraq Dinars were accepted in Kuwait at par. Immediately after the war started the demand for silver rupees in Kuwait increased. This demand became more acute during the Iraq trouble when a 100 rupee note was sold in the market in return of 75 silver rupees and Iraq Dinar could be purchased for Ks.7/8/- only. It is an open secret that there is more than enough silver in Kuwait which is lying underground. In conclusion I may add that the position re: silver rupees is now improving in Kuwait and I understand that the bank has more than one hundred customers who have deposited large sums of silver in the bank.Confidential D.O. No.C/643&gt; fhe Agency, Bahrain, the 11th May 1942. Many thanks for your demi-official letter No.C/404-8/1 dated the 20th April 1942. 2. During the last six weeks I have issued no permits for the export of silver to Kuwait, and I am glad to know that this strictness is, from what you say, fully justified. Now that the export of silver from Bahrain to Kuwait is restricted to the comparatively small amounts that can be smuggled through, new methods of * playing the money market* will certainly be devised by Kuwait and Basrawi and Bahraini merchants and brokers, and we shall have to be on the look out for their next move. Its an interesting kind of game that we play with these gentle men; their greater skill in playing the game is balanced by the authority that we have to alter the rules*.. 3. I am sorry that your projected visit to Bahrain did not materialise. The climate here is not, however, very attractive at the moment. One gets no wetter in a bath*.
