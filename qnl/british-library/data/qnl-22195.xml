Your Excellency was unable to arrange the visit at this time. Later in your No. 161 dated the 18th Ramadhan *57 Your Excellency drew the Compaiy's attention to para V C V of schedule No, 1 to the company's Oil Concession Agreement of 1937 (by which Your Excellency's formal permission in writing is necessary before a coup any party can visit the Al Faiyah area). In 1939 war broke out and the question of this visit was not followed up, 2, The war has now ended and plans are being made for geological work on the i’ruci&amp;l Coast, Work is expected to commence about January 1946 (Safar 1365) and will continue up to the end of the oool season. We shall be glad if Your Excellency will make the necessary arrangements for our geologists to visit the Jabal Faiyah area in January 1946 (bafar 1365 ) and provide the necessary friends and guards to ensure that the party can do their geologio&amp;l work in safety and without hindrance. The party will remain in the Al Faiyah area as long as necessary for them to complete their work*, We shall be pleased if Your Excellency will inform us in writing as soon as the visit is arranged with full particulars in order that our geologists will have time to make their programme. Your Excellency's letter should also include the formal permission for the company's party to visit the Al Faiyah area as laid down in para 'O' of schedule No. 1 to the Sharjah Oil Concession Agreement of 1937 between the company and Your Excellency. „ 3.

My dear Colonel, Rumours have reached me of a recent boundary dispute between Abu Dhabi and Dubai. We are Y e ^ interested in such matters and there is an added interest in this case in that we hope to have geologists working in the Trucial Coast hinterland very shortly. If it is in order I should be very grateful for the particulars and an assurance that the dispute is unlikely to be revived when our geologists appear or while they are operating. In this connection it is expected that they will move out from Dubai towards the end of December 1945 or early January 1946 and remain in the field while there is work to do and until weather conditions become favourable.

We assume that it is now in order for the geologists* party to proceed to Jabal Faiyah under the arrangements made by the Ruler of Sharjah. It is understood that the brother of the Shaikh of Sharjah will travel with the party to Jabal Faiyah where they will meet the Shaikh of the Beni Kitab. 5.

I enclose a file of correspondence from Lermitte which includes our geologists TCL/5 dated the 13th January 1946 addressed to Capt. Murphy and giving his proposed programme, also Lermitte 1 s PTC/46/5 dated the 15th January, which also tabulates the programme vide para 2(a) to (f). 3. You will observe from these letters that Lermitte and the geologists are in close contact with the Assistant Political Agent, Sharjah. 4. It would seem that Lermitte and Murphy consider that satisfactory arrangements for the whole programme can be made by them locally with the possible exception of the Muscat coast (along the base of the mountains) - vide Lermitte's letter PTC/46/5 2(c). Reference this Muscat trip Lermitte in his letter seems to think that it will be in order for the Company to advise the Political Agent, Muscat, and H.H. the sultan but perhaps he means that we here should ask you to arrange matters through the Political Agent, Muscat. This would appear to be more in line with^accepted previous procedure. Perhaps you will instruct us on this point. 5. Minor points are: (a) The present of a rifle from the Company to Moh’d Ali of the Beni Kitab. You will remember that I reminded you last night that the Political Resident some years back made very clear to us that presents of rifles should be made by Government Officials only. Confidential. BAHRAIN RECEIPT. -N* Date t IfcL- - “ (S&gt; t3 E DO/TSD.4/4115 (contd.) If, however, a service rifle can now be made available for us on payment for presenta tion to Moh'd Ali we should like to be informed. (b) The scale of presents to tribal leaders vide para 4 of Lermitte f s PTC/46/5. As far as we are concerned, amounts can be as advised by the Assistant Political Agent on the spot. (c) You will note from Lermitte T s PTC/46/4 dated the 14th January that the interpreter recom mended by the Assistant Political Agent, Sharjah, is Naser bin Abdulatif, the son of the late Residency Agent, who was with the Locust Party and with the 7th A.A.F.Geodetic Control Sqdn. United Army Air Forces, both in Trucial Oman and Muscat &amp; Oman. 6. It is quite clear from the arrangements being made for the visit to Jabal Faiyah and the conversations between the brother of the Shaikh of Sharjah, Moh T d Ali of the Bani Kitab and Lermitte that the Beni Kitab do not admit that the Ruler of Sharjah has any authority in the Jabal Faiyah area. Apparently, the brother of the Ruler was not allowed to enter the area. You will observe, however, that Lermitte was very careful to maintain that the Company’s oil agreement with the Shaikh of Sharjah covered the Jabal Faiyah area. 7.

I have not yet received a report from the political Officer, Trucial Coast, and as matters seem to have gone a stage further than the actual Trucial Coast I am leaving for Sharjah tomorrow morning to check certain points. 3. Another reason for my visit is that there has been a bigger raid than usual by Dubai people on Abu Dhabi camels,and apparently some retaliatory measures have been taken. I am not sure of the locality, but it must be distant from your geologists' party. 4. As regards ?!uscat, I agree with your view and will obtain confirmation of the procedure to be adopted. 5.

T ‘^e require to study the geology of the country lying between T ebel yaiyah and Jebel Hafit. '^his will entail freedom of movement from the mountain front westwards for a distance of at least 25 miles. Prominent points along the mountain front are Tebels Podha, gams ini, Mahadha, qatar, etc. A distance of up to 5 miles to the Past will also require to be covered. We wish to make this journey direct from Faiyah without the necessity of first making contact with Abu Dhabi. 3 • Jebel TTafit Area . A geological nap of Hafit mountain is required. Por this purpose complete freedom of move ment over and around J. Hafit will be necessary. If ti^e remits we also wish to penetrate as far to the south of Hafit as is practicable to w.T. 4.

Murphy, Captain R. Olynn Xones, Petroleura nevelopnent ( r rrucial Coast) Ltd., Dubai, _ —ly dear T'urt&gt;hy, Reference our conversation of this morning I give you helow a summary of ray talks with the Ruler of Sharjah, his brother ^'chained bin Sanr and Kohaned bin Ali of the Benni Kitab, regarding the entry of our geological party to the Jabal Faiyah area. On Saturday the 5th of January I called on shaikh Sultan bin Saqr at Sharjah and he confirmed in the presence of his brother ^ohamed that *11 arrangements had been made for the narty to proceed to Fai' r at. T'ohamed also mentioned that he would himself conduct the party to Tr ohamed bin Ali and would then return. On T^ondey the 7th of January T dined at Sharjah Tr ith the Ruler, his brother Tf oharaed and T'ohamed bin Ali. Once pvain they confirmed that there was no objection to the party nrcoeeding to Jabal F-iyah and that once there ' T ohamed bin Ali would appoint ten guards including two of his relations, one of whom would be Ali bin Abdulla. On Thursday the 10th of January T called on the Ruler of Sharjah and he suwnoned his brother T'ohamed bin Saqr and I-ohamed bin Ali. It was arranged that |r ohamed bin Ali should proceed to Dhaid the following day and arrange for lunoh etc. on the arrival of myself and Bohamed bin Saqr on Saturday. The Company’s geologists, Capt. G-lynn Jones and ? T r. Ramsden, arrived on Friday the 11th of January and as my visit to Dhaid had already been arranged it was thought a good oppotunity for them to try out the trans ort vehicles, get to know the tracks, and to meet ^ohamed hin Ali. On Saturday the 12th of January we proceeded to Dhaid accompanied by TT ohamed bin Saqr, Xhalid bin Sultan and four others. At Dhsid we were entertained by T T ohamed bin Ali. T had already expressed our desire to proceed along t^e ropfl to^rds vniyah in order to ascertain T diether it would be passable by the 3-ton lorry. As no preparations Tr ero being ^ade to move off, T asked the reason for the delay. T was informed by Tr ohamed bin Saqr thwt Wohamed bin Ali, who hrd joined his men outside, was asking for P3.10,000/- for the rivht to work in the Fciyah area. T informed ? r ohamed bin Saqr that the oil agreement was trith the Shaikh of Sharjah and that the Jabal Faiyah ^rea T 'as included in it, and that both the Shaikh and he himself had assured the Political Agent, Bahrain °nd myself that all arrangements had been made for the party to proceed to Faiyah, and that if any payment was to be made to Tohamed bin Ali it should be made by the Shaikh of Sharjah. T informed TT ohamed bin Saqr that if the Company thought fit to give Tohamed bin Ali a personal present for a successful season’s work it would do so, but that there could be no question of payment for the right to work in the area as that was already covered by the oil agreement. After a good deal more delay, and attempts by Tohamed bin Saqr to make me pay first F. r ..6,000/- then E3.5,000/-, I intimated that we would h o ve to return as it was getting late. Tr ohamed bin Ali, who had not spoken to me direct on the subject, then came up and sc id that he had received nothing from the oil comnanv ^hereas °11 the coastal shaikhs had for years been in receipt of an annual income. He also said that Jabal Faiyah and the surrounding country was his and that it did not belong to Sharjah, and that he understood that Sharjah was receiving money for the Faiyah area. He also said that Dhaid belonged to him.I nsked T T ohaiued bin Mi vrhether he had changed his mind with regard to letting the perty go to Faiyah. He replied that the party were free to go wherever they liked and that he had appointed Ali bin Abdulla and one other member of his family and eight others as guards. Tie then asked for a rifle which I nronised to do my best to obtain. T then asked whether we could proceed along the road towards Faiyah in order to see the country. I'ohaned bin Ali agreed but asked th^t none of the Sharjah people^ should ecconpany us and asked that Tohamed bin Saar be given a car to return to Sharjah ’ ith all his followers. After , a few minutes wohamed bin Saar came up and said th-t he ' vrould return to Sharjah independently n S he h-M certain business to see to. T accordingly agreed and detailed a car for him. Ali bin Abdulla then accompanied us a few miles along the ^Myah road. w e then returned to Phaid and informed Ali that we honed to return in about four days, to which he renlied that he r ^s ready whenever we should arrive• Yours sincerely, Sd. B.TT. Lermitte. Cant. Tharphy, British Agency, Sharjah.D.O. Ho. prc/46/10 Dubai. 21st January 1946 dear I'urphy, Deferrins: to rny tal v T dth you yosterday evening on ^.y return from Dhaid, and to my interview * ith the P.ulor of Shariah this morning, I now give you a sir Mary of the events of the last few days. ^n Friday the 13th of January 1946 I introduced T h’. Crljmn Jones to the Puler of Sharjah and again reminded him of his promise to give me .a - ritten re^ly to the several letters sent to him by the Company from Bahrain, re the entry into Jabal Fayah area. He praised to let me have the letter the following day. He also again stated th^t all arrangements had been made for the Company’s work at Jabal Fayah and'added that his brother TT oh°ned bin Saqr ' r ould precede us to Dhaid the following morning in order to have everything ready. m he folio 1 n.ng morning we proceeded to Dhaid from Shar.iah at 08.oc. At Dhaid ^re found th t I ohamed bin Saqr had not arrived and on enquiring frola Shaikh Ithalid bin Ahmed, Hegent of Kalab, we were told th-t Mohamed had as yet not been seen. This vi as confirmed by several Beni fitab men. I then proceeded to the camp usually occupied by Ali bin Abdulla end was informed that he had gone north towards T Hiatt and that TT ohamed bin Ali v/as in Has al Khaimah. m he geologists began erecting camp near Shaikh , 'Cialid’s fort and I proceeded towards T Tiatt to look for Ali bin Abdulla whom T found encamped in the sand dimes almost opnosite Khatt. I informed him tlwt the party had arrived and that I \ms surprised there was nobody at Dhaid to receive us. He replied that he did not know we were arriving that day. T then asked for the eight guards which TT ohamed bin Ali had said- should look after the camp. He had no ne 1 t? of TT oh med bin Saqr. T returned to the camp with his son Said and one2 other and ar-ranged to send a truck the follov/in^ morning for the remainder. ^hat night T arranged ^or extra guards frvom Shaikh T Sialid and the following morning sent a truck to fetch Ali bin Abdulla, and the seven guards. On their arrival T informed Ali bin Abdulla that ^-ae geologists wished to go to Jabal Fayah in ofder to examine the '’out3 and choose a camp site. 1. rn he 'cousins' -ho live at - T abal Fayah had not been informed o^ the intended arrival o-° the p.nrty and would therefore not let the partv through. 0. m he party v/ould n^t be able to go to Baraini under Beni oitab protection as their territory only extended as far as Bamlat f iynaij. (I rermnded Ali that T '‘ohamed bin A 1 ! had said that the party could be taken all the T r ay to Baraimi). 3. Ali bin Abdulla said that he had not been at Shariah when the arrangements were discussed tlth the guler and thus did not know what had been arranged. Be admitted, ho-'ever, that wohamed bin Ali had informed me in ms presence on 12.1.46 that he was to accompany the party. 4. ^e demanded T .10/- per day :'or each guard and expected much more for himself and the other member of the shaikhly family. Stated tlwt either Sultan bin Saqr or T'ohamed bin Saqr should accompany the party the '-hole way. Tt v/in h© remembered that Hohamed bin Ali told me on the 12th January that he did not want v ohamed bin Saqr oo remain at Dhaid and asked me for a car in order to send him and his followers hack to Shariah. Ali bin Ali bin A.bdulla then intimated that he had something Abdulla had himself (about 9th January) informed you th°t ^either he nor T!r ohamed bin Ali wished the party ——to p-o to their country through Shar.iah introduction nor through any Jowasim ^uler. 6, waid that the area between ^amlat f Tnaij and 'R^raimi Tms shared by neni Ka f ab, Bei o.itab and Abu 'nhabi, and that vie 'pould not be allowed to enter it. As I could see that a/e v/ere at an impasse T returned to -Bhar’ah and reported to you. In the meantime T have arranged with Shaikh Khalid that the geologists visit v ^adi Sor and ICalba. T 1 ey were to leave this morning and ^vould spend about tliree da^rs on the trip. Last evening T sent my driver to the Buler of Shar.iah ashing for the letter he had promised to send me the day before. He returned with a letter which merely stated that the nay of guards should be the same as in Saudi Arabi *. I then wrote him another letter informing him that, he had not renlied to my request asking f’or a written statement that all arrangements had been made for the entry of the party to Jabal Hpyah, and informed him that T would expect this to be ready the following morning when T would send my driver for it. ^his morning the letter was collected and I enclose a copy. T then went to see the Buler of Shariah with Tassim and again asked him if all arrangements had been made for the party to visit Jabal Fayah. He again assured me that all had been arranged and that there would be no hitch. I then informed him of what had happened and added that if there was any more delay the party would return and work in other areas. T told him that he hwd been advised by the Political and ourselves of the arrival of the party and that he had had plenty of time to make call the necessary arrangements. T also informed him that the money he had received -^ron the Company ^ver the cast a 1 years should have been used to pave the Tr ay, and that this he had not apparently done ^s Tr ohamed bin A 1 ! had informed me that he had not received anything I then gave him a friendly warning and told him that4 if he ' t ps not in control of Jabal 'Tayah then the Oonpany mi^ht have to make other arrangements to go there, and that this might mean that his agreement might have to he revised. TTe then told me that certain persons mere intriguing and putting ideas into the Pedus T heads. As T 'ohaned bin 3aqr has gone to Abu Dhabi, to give safe conduct to Zaid bin 3ultan and 7r ohamed bin T 3ialifa, Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr asked me to take him to Dh-id tomorrow in. order to settle the matter. or -ohamed a-company the party the --hole way, and, if possible, obtain a written statement that there will be no more delays or hitches, and that the party will have complete freedom of movement and every facility required by then for the purposes o' the Sonpany f s operations. I will leave Shan*ah T 'ith Sultan tomorrow at 08.00 and will keep you fully advised of events. it is necessary T will insist that either Sultan 'ours sincerely 3d. 3.H. Iwmitte Oaptain P.0.

Dubai. 25th January, 1946, My dear Murphy, I would refer you to my 46/10 of 2lat January. w I left Sharjah on the morning of the 22nd accompanied by the Ruler. r On arrival at Dhaid Shaikh Sultan proceeded to the encampment of Hi bin Abdulla where he stayed the night. The next morning he arrived with All bih. Abdulla and Mahdad bin Ali bin Abdulla and we had a long talk. They informed me that all arrangements had now been made and that the geologists could now go wherever they wished even to Baraimi. Ali added that the sand at Ranlat *TnaiJ was very soft end might be found impassable for the motor transport and said that a detour could be made round it into Beni Kaab territory, the party leaving the Beni Kaab area directly the sand was passed. He assured me ho could arrange this and that there would be no delay. I suggested that it would be bettor if the party was accompanied by either Shaikh Sultan bin Soar or his brother Mohamed, to which Ali bin Abdulla quickly replied that this was not necessary and added that Rashid Burhama, to whom Sultan bin Saqr referred to as w his man 19 , was to be removed and on no account was to be with the party. It would appear thdt Ali bin Abdulla has once again changed his mind regarding the inclusion in the party of a Sharjah representative. It was then arranged that I should discharge all Shaikh Khalid* s guards which were to be replaced the following morning by Beni Qitab men. Ali bin Abdulla agreed to the pay of the guards being Rs.2/- per day, plus food, and for the members of the shalkhly family Rs.5/- per day, plus food. There were to be ten guards and three from the shaikhly family. The family members would be Ali bin Abdulla and his two sons Said and Mahdad. Later Mohamed bin Saqr arrived and was informed of the decisions made. At 3 p.ra. they all left to take lunch with Mohamed bin Ali who was encamped near Falal al Ali. ^ Ali bin Abdulla returned with the Sharjah party to Sharjah that night. The geological party returned #rom their visit to Kalba dnd Khor Pakkan, accompanied by Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed at 3.30 p.ra.The following morning I arranged for the removal of Shaikh Khalid’s guards, leaving five in the Fort to look after the geological equipment and petrol and kerosene dump. Later the Beni Qitab party arrived and after the usual ceremonies wo proceeded to Jabal Faiyah in three cars. The Jabal was climbed by our party and notes and bearings etc taken. After lunch we returned to Dhaid and arranged with the Beni Qitab guards to resume work at Jabal Faiyah the following morning. This morning, Friday the 25th January 1946, the geologists left for Jabal Faiyah at 8.30 accompanied by Beni Qitab guards. ^ called on Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed and thanked him for his personal assistance in taking the party through Wadi Gor to Kalba and Khor Fakkan and back, after which I returned to Sharjah and reported to you. For the moment the atmosphere is very friendly and the Beni Qitab cooperative. Ali bin Abdulla was not visible this morning and his place was taken by ’Amr bin Saleh bin Uetaweh. The composition of the geological party is as follows: Mr. Glynn-Jones, Geologist in charge. Mr. Ramsden, Assistant Geologist. 1 Interpreter, Nasser bin Abdulatif. 1 Iraqui mechanic. 1 Iraqui driver. 1 Goanese cook. 1 Kurdi bearer. 1 Muscati bearer. 1 Local cook. 2 Local cook*s assistants. 3 Local drivers (including 1 second driver for truck). 8 Local coolies. 13 Beni Qitab men. 5 Shaikh Khalid*s men. (in Dhaid Fort). All the above are rationed and provided with tentage, with.the exception of the guards who do not get tentage. Ali bin Abdulla informed me that it might be necessary for him to discharge some of the guards HiuuabDcitaAxgxA if the party move south, and replace them^Uocally recruited Beni Qitab men, to which I agreed. Mr. Glynn-Jones asked me to advise you that he might wish to make a quick trip north to Has al Khaimah, direct from Dhaid. I would be obliged if you would inform me whether this will be in order and if so whether we should advise Shaikh Sultan bin Salem. Presumably Shaikh Khalid's raffiks (Jowasim)would be acceptable.WM v ‘ 3* Should the work in the Jabal Faiynh area proceed smoothly I would like in the near future to pay a visit to Shaikh Shakhboot at Baraimi in order to inform him in more detail of the geologists intended visit and plans. I am sending to Abu Dhabi in a few days time 200 tins of petrol and 50 tins of kerosene for onward despatch to Baraimi. Yours sincerely, S4/- B.H.Lermitte. Capt.

Ahmad as Saif, chief of the Na f im in Hafit village, 37 kilometres south from Lumwejeh, was ill and I was unable to visit him but Zaid assured me that he would talk with him and that T could arrange for the party to visit his sm&amp;ll territory if it was thought necessary. T will do this when I return to Baraimi before the party moves in. Saqr bin Sultan owns only a very small area surrounding Baraimi and vSa f arah villages, and his influence does not extend any distance eastwards. It will possibly not be necessary to enter his area, and the cars can always go round it. He is young, mean and timid. Pecently he made two trips to visit the Sultan of Muscat and on both occasions turned back before meeting with the Sultan. Muscat influence does not seem to be anywhere evident, even as far south as Dhank. Dhank is owned by the A1 Bu Shamis, Na T im and several sub-sections of tribes, the chief of which are;- 1. A1 bu Shamis, Mohamed bin Salmin Burhama. 2. Na f im, Saqr bin Sultan. 3. A1 bu Shamis, Hamed Lehaiyeh. 4. Mata bin Salem, previously Al bu Shamis but now declares himself independent. I left Lumwejeh on Tueseday the 5th of February, and spent the night at Abu Dhabi. The following morning I left Abu Dhabi and met Shakhbut 16 kilometres out, near Maqta. I gave him all the news of my visit to Baraimi and he again assured me of his help in any way I required. I arrived at Dubai yesterday evening and this morning cabled you a brief resume of the result of my trip. This evening 200 tins of petrol and 50 tins of kerosene are leaving by launch for Abu Dhabi. Camels are waiting there to take them to Lumwejeh. T have also arranged for 40 more camels to take the camp gear from Abu Dhabi to Baraimi as I consider the sand Country too difficult for the cars and lorry. F.V. Packer Esq., Bahrain, c. Cant. P.C.

I enclose a translation of a statement made by Nasir bin Abdul Latif who is employed as an interpreter by Qlynn Jones, from which it will be seen that the madman has been active again. Qlynn Jones, the Chief geologist and his Deputy ^ represented the matter to me officially yesterday morning. ifci I have seen the bullet marks on the car and it is quite obvious that the man was shooting to kill. One shot went through the waterproof cover of the truck and the other nicked the front of the radiator. 3 . I went to the Shaikh of Sharjah yesterday and demanded the immediate arrest of the man whose name is Amir bin Salim bin Nashir of the Beni Qitab. The Shaikh took necessary action in the matter and Amir bin Salim bin Nashir has been apprehended by °haikh Muhammad bin Ali bin Huwaidin and will be handed over to an escort tomorrow who will bring him to Sharjah where he will be imprisoned. From all accounts he is mentally deranged and I am informed that he shot and wounded a man last year. He has, however, never been known to shoot at cars which are fairly common sight on the track between Sharjah and Dhaid. His apparent phobia for the geologists’s transport is therefore strange but so far there is nothing which indicates that he was prompted to indulge in this particular form of ’’target practice”. The casual way in which a lunatic is permitted by his fellow tribesmen to roam around armed is, I suppose, understandable. I am, however, pursuing my inquiries into the matter. Confidential. BAHRAIN' RECEIPT.4 • Mr. Baker the Chief geologist and Mr. Wellings the Depftty chief geologist are living with Glynn Jones in the house rented from Than Bahadur Sayid Abdur Hazzaq who, incidently, left by air for Basrah today. They have been making daily trips to places of interest to them and expect to leave by air on Wednesday next. 5. Glynn Jones hopes to fly from here next Friday and spend the week-end in Basrah. He asked me how to obtain priority for his return journey and I suggested that he applied to you through Mr. Packer. 69 Th ey ^ re now preparing to operate in the Baraimi area and 'dumping' petrol stores etc. Mr. Lermitte has again gone to Baraimi but this time by the direct southern route. His visit is in the nature of a reconnaissance to ascertain the possibility of taking short cut to Baraimi and thus avoid the longer journey via Abu J habi. I doubt very much, however, if it will be possible for the geological party to take their 3 ton truck on this route. Travelling in these parts as you know is hazardous at the best of Jj times but is now rendered even more so due to the thickening and loosening of the sand on the tracks resulting from the failure of the rains.

From his letter dated the 16th it would appear that Mr. Lermitte has successfully raved the way for the geological party’s entry into the Buraimi and Hafit areas. Shaikh Saar bin Sultan’s letter would appear to be an expression of his hope for recognition and renumeration in return for the help he has promised the Oil Company. His reference to the »» tyrannies of K.B. Abdul Razzaq might be considered as a ’nice approach’ to such a request. 4. It will be seen from his letter dated the 17th that he has taken a very strong line with the Shaikh of Sharjah over the shooting incident. He seems to think that the ’madman’ was not solely responsible for tbe shooting but so far I have not been able to dicover any evidence in support of his suspicions, although, as I have stated in my previous letter, it is certainly strange that he selected the Oil Company’s trucks to shoot at on two occasions. I propose, however, to see the Shaikh again and press for further enquiries. i 7 , y^~ir-o &lt;y. 5 Lieutenant-Colonel A.C. Galloway, O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. 7 v Co r 1 jntial. T3AHR . ' ~'0EIPT.Copy : • /Yj D.O. No.PTC/46/27 Dubai. 16th February 1946. My dear Packer, T hare .lust returned from Baraimi h-ring left Lunr.ve.1ah at 7.50 this morning and arriving at Dubai at 3.50 p.m., a distance of 182 miles. T left Dubai on Wednesday the 13th of^February, and proceeded north towards Shariah and took the main larfla east to Jabal Faivah. This larfla is the main caravan route to Baraimi, Kalba, the Batinah const and Muscat. Proceeding down the west side of the label I made Jabal Sumaini and then arrived at Jabal Aiyal up against which the Hamlet ’Anaij lies. The crossing of the sand hills, although only 5 kilometres wide at this point, took two and a half hours, assisted by some Bani Kaab bedouin who were luckily also passing through the track. This route is the main caravan track from north to south. Proceeding southwards along the base of the main mountain range I turned inside the outer low range passing Kahil and TTuwai-i villages and finally reached Mahadhah village which is the headquarters of f 0baid bin Juma T a, Chief of the Bani Kaab. ’Obcid, however, was not at the village so I proceeded southwards and rejoined the main plain south of Rami Kahil, which is impassable for cars. Proceeding eastwards I passed through the gap of the Jabal Aouha range and passing Sa’arah, Baraimi and HamaSa villages finally reached Lumwejeh where I spent the night, a total distance of 133 miles over very exhaust ing going. The following morning, Thursday the 14th of February, I left at sunrise and proceeded south to Hafit village to get a raffik to take me to the encampment where Shaikh Ahmad as S a lf was supposed to be staying. Luckily he had lust arrived so I was able to have a long talk with him and pursuaded him to return with me to Lumweleh for the night, which he did. After further talks he finally agreed to allow the geological party into his territory and to provide guards, guides etc. The next morning, Friday the 15th of February, T called on Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan a.l Hamud, the Na»im chief at Baraimi village, and obtained a raffik from him in order to get an idea of the extent of his territory. Whilst at the mountain base, east of Baraimi, I turned northwards at Jabal llmbateh inside the outer range and proceeded up the Wadi named r adiain where T knew f 0baid bin Juma’a was sometimes to be found. Passing along the eastern side of Jabals Khatum and Midha I passed Tawi Ali bin Khamis and finally arrived at Falij Wadiain where I found Obaid bin Juma f a encamped. With him was his nephew Said bin Salem bin De f en. After repeated Fawalahs and rounds of coffee I had a talk with ’Obaid and S a id and ’Obaid agreed to personally conduct the party through his territory^ whenever T should send word that he was required. Returning to Baraimi village I was entertained by Shaikh Saar bin Sultan al Hamud to lunch at 4.50 p.m. after lunch we had a talk and he also agreed to allow the geological party access to his territory if they required, and agreed to supply rniides and guards. On leaving he h°nded me a letter which he asked me to open only after arriving at Dubai* I enclose a translation. I also met Abdulaziz bin Sultan the nephew of Rashid bin Hamed the Shauamis Shaikh of Hamasa village. The Shaikh, who had not yet returned from Muscat, owns a small area about 10 miles S.F. of the southern tip of Jabal Hafit. So far all the territory surrounding Jabal Hafit and along the main mountain range eastwards is open to the geologists. The only area which have not been financially agreedon are the ^ani Kaab and Nr*I n area east^rds from Baraimi village, ''Whether any work will be done in these areas will be decided by Mr. Glynn Jones when he reaches Jabal Hafit. l he area south and west of the Jabal are also open as mentioned my PTC/46/24 of the 7th of February. T have .lust been informed that during my absence the Ford lorry was fired on twice by a Bani Qdtab tribesman near Fala,1 al Ali. My informant states that one bullet went through the driver’s cab and the other through the tarpaulin cover. T understand the driver was accompanied by the interpreter Nassir bin Abdulatif and a man supplied by the Shaikh, of Sharjah. The truck had to return by a different route. I will make full enquiries and report what action has been taken. Yours sincerely, Sfl. B.H. Lermitte. F.y. Packer Fsq. Bahrain. c. Capt R.C. Furrhy, Sharjah.cop y: D.O. No.PTC/46/28 My dear Packer, Reference the recent shoot5.ng incident near Dhaid. T enclose a copy of the report of the interpreter TTassir hi^' Abdulatif. The P.O., Shariah, was informed of the incident immediately on the return of Passir and at once informed the Shaikh of Shariah vdio promised to make full enquiries and bring in the culprit, A written protest was also lodged and a reply has to-day been received from the Shaikh stating that the culprit has been brought in to Shariah and is now in jail, and that'further enquiries are being made. \ /\ / second ■'v- After discussing the incident with Oapt. Murphy this morning I asked that Jassim accompany me to the Shaikh of Sharjah in order that I could formally complain of the affair. On arrival at the fort we were kent waiting while the Shaikh was sent for from a nearby house. Directly on his arrival I informed him, th?'ough Jassim, that I had come for a third time to complain of yet a third incident that has hanpened in his territory., T pointed out that the first incident was when his men,-the Rani Oitab, refused (20.1.^-6) to allow the geological party to proceed south to Jabal ^aiyah, and this was after I had had his repeated promise ^hat all had been arranged. I had also received his written promise to this effect and he had also v/ritten to you making the same statement. The/incident was when Mr. Ramsden was fired on near the camp at Bhaid. And now the third incident when employees of the Company had been fired on deliberately with intent to kill. One bullet passed through the anp-le^from Just in front of the engine and the other through the tarpaulin cover .lust behind the driver’s head. The Shaikh informed me that this was the work of the madman who had fired on Mr. Ramsden and that he could not be blamed for the doings of a madman. I pointed out that.after the fifst shooting the culprit had not been caught and had been allowed to be at large. The Shaikh said that &amp;t the time of that incident Mohamed bin All had been at TTmn al Quwain. I reminded the Shaikh that this was no excuse for his not taking any action for over ten days, and that if he v/as really the Ruler of the Bani qitab country he could easily have had the man arrested and brought in. T once ag in informed him that the Company had been trying for the past eight or nine years to obtain access to the Jabal Raiyah area, and that this had only fesEX recently been obtained but had resulted in three incidents two of which were very grave. He made the excuse that previously intrigue by certain persons had prevented access to the interior. I pointed out to him that even on my visit to Dhaid on 12th January, Mohamed bin Ali had asked me for a car in order to send Mohamed bin Saqr and all Sharjah men ba^k to Sharjah, as he could not allow them into the Jabal Faiyah area. He retorted saying that his brother did not wish to proceed south and himself wished to return to Sharjah. I replied that this was not so and he knew it. Continuing T nointed out the very grave consenuencies which would h^ve resulted had any employee of the Company been wounded or killed, whether he be British or Arab. He informed that all was now well and th°t there would be no further incidents, as the culprit was now enchained in his fort. I informed him that Messrs. Baker, wellings, Glynn Jones and Ransden wished to proceed tomorrow on a trip round Jabal Raiyah and back to Sharjah. He promised to send his son and guards and' once again affirmed' that all would be well. I pointed out that perhaps members of the family of the so-called madman might take revenge. He stated that this/- tthis would not be so. T then asked #hat steps were being taken in order to ascertain why the 'madman' fired on the Company vehicles only, and reminded him that other cars were daily passing along the ^taaid road and that the locust party were not interfered with. He stated that it was by chance a Company Vehicle. I stated that this was rot so as the 'madman' had taken the trouble to pro to the c°mp site south of Dhaid in order to fire on the ^irst occasion. T suggested to the Shaikh that^-KL might be a good idea to thoroughly beat the 'madman' in order to find out who was at the bottom of the series of incidents which are directed at the Comapny only. I pointed out that it was useless for him to appoint and insist on guards if shootinjswere to repeatedly occur. As I could get no satisfactory answers out of him I informed him that T was renorting the matter to the Company who would take a very serious view of the incident. I am sure' he does not realise the seriousness of the affair. I also reminded him of my previous warning that perhaps the Campany might be obliged to make direct arrangments with the Bani oitab in order to get access to this territory which he claimed but could not control. T ended by saving that I travel from Has al Khaimah as far south as Dhank and have never met with any obstruction, the only nlace where there seems to be no control was in his territory. The P.O., Sher.lah, is seeing the Shaikh again tomorrow and will press for urther enquiries. Yours sincerely, E.V. Hacker Esq., Bahrain.venerable father, Sultan bin ! T uhairanad, had firm friendly relations with the Hiffh British Government. The late Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif and all his sons know about that and they had bestowed their favours upon us. But they have unfortunately been succeeded by Abdur pazzak who trod on our rights and boosted up our subjects such as Ash-Sharai (Shaikh of Fujairah) and others. We request the Sahib to give consideration to the old friends of the Br5.tish Government as he does to the Trucial Coast peonle.

Dear Sir, I have the honour to refer to concessions held by petroleum Development (Qatarj Limited and petroleum Development (Trucial coast; limited in the Persian culf areas implied by the names of these Companies, iou will recall that political agreements were signed by the companies concerned in respect of each of the concessions obtained from the rulers of these territories. One requirement of these political agreements (Article 3) is that 'the employees of the Company in shall at all times be British subjects or subjects of the Shaikh, provided that, with the consent of ms Majesty's uovemment, such persons of other nationality as are required for the efficient carrying on of the undertaking may be employed. During the winter season of 1946/47 the Companies propose to employ one team of geophysicists in the carrying out of a Seismic survey of Qatar, and another team to carry out a gravity meter and magnetometer survey on the -rrucial Coast. These teams will consist o American personnel, of about seven individuals for the former and up to eleven for the latter. You will appreciate that British personnel .or this purpose does not at present exist. The individuals who will compose these teams are in most but not all cases already working for this Company and its Associates in the Middle East, Iraq and Palestine. It is, however, not yet possible o inform you with full accuracy of the names of those who will m fact be working, with effect from September or October, in Qatar and on the •rrucial Coast. These names will be reported to you as soon as they are established. The work in Qatar is expected to last for three months and that on the 'rrucial Coast for the full winter season from September or October 1946 to April or May 1947. It is hoped that you will find no objection to the arrangements herein proposed. A second clause of Article 3 of the political agreements that 'the importation of foreign native labour shall be subject to the approval of the Political Resident in the Persian tiulf.” Steps wi 1, therefore, be taken in due course to acquaint the Political Resident w particulars of any foreign native labour which it may be necessary to import temporarily into these territories, and his agreement will oe obtained.

Lermitte reported to me that Abdullah bin Lasan, Shaikh of Jazirat al Pamrah (or Jazirat Za'ab) who is under Ras al Khaimah has objected to the party operating in his territory. I advised kr. Lermitte to approach the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah and require Piim to facilitate the Party's work as Jazirat al Ramrah is within Has al Khaimah territory. Pie did so and th.e party was eventually allowed to operate in that area. again approached me sayiig tliat the seven guai'ds provided by ttie Shaikh of Ras al Khaimaf to accompany the Party P-ave demanded fantastic wages i.e. iti.lb/- per tier per day instead of thie usual rate of iis.2/- per day.

The Shaikh promised to be present himself at the place where the party will be working in oraer to see that the guards oo not make any trouble and, if necessary, to change those who may be discontented.

Regarding para 5. On the 28th October kr. Brookes brought the Has al khaimah guard to me for interrogation. From his statement it appeared that the bedouin who obstructed the Company's vehicle, whose name is Rashid bin humaia is a youth of no importance. Be is of the Khawatir tribe undei the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah ana the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah passed through that spot that day on his way to Ras al Khaimah ana the matter was reported to him by the guard. The Shaikh of Has el Khaimah is reported to have stated that he would be taking up the matter with Ali bin Seif al nhatiri, head of the Khawatir tribe. I then issued a letter to the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah, a copy of translation of which is enclosed for your information. This incident took place on the 26th of October.On the 29th of October kr.

Such inciceiits by r inaiviaual bedouins &amp;re no doubt cue to the weakness of the Shaikhs concerned ana their leek of control over their beoouins. The Shaikh oi has al Khaimah is in no way in a better position than his colleague the Shaikh ot Sharjah as far as their influence over their bedouins or in other v.oras M their subjects”, as they call them, is concerned.

The next day the same man halted a second vehicle at Arqab as Shafriyah in Ras al Khaimah territory. The Residency Agent wrote to the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah who stated that he had arrested the man and brought him to Ras al Khaimah whence, so the Shaikh reports, he subsequently succeeded in escaping.

We consider that one day should be sufficient. Apparently, readings taken on either side of the island vary considerably, and readings on Hamriyeh will be useful to complete the picture. 2. We understand Mr. Lermitte discussed this with you recently and you favoured a simple cash payment rather than a written agreement of the nature of an exploration permit for certain reasons which need not be repeated in this letter. Mr. Lermitte takes the view that a few hundred rupees will satisfy the Shaikh. 3. Our Chief Geologist, Mr. N. Baker, is expected shortly and we anticipate that he will wish the examination of Hamriyeh to be made. In this case, we shall be grateful if you will confirm that you have no objection to the Cornpany approaching the Shaikh on the above lines and, if he agrees, proceeding with the vyork without further reference to you. Mr. Jackson, the Company representative with the geologists, will of course keep the Residency Agent, Sharjah, informed. 4.

The Shaikh of Sharjah who was addressed on the subject by me replied that the bedouins responsible did not actually prevent the vehicle from passing through that area but what they really meant was that the vehicle should keep av/ay from their camels and cattle as they might be scared. The Shaikh of Sharjah further informed me that he had taken up the matter with the Beni oitab Chief who promised to see that the said bedouins made no more difficulty for the Company. 3 . on the 15th November, I took ?

The Shaikh of Dubai had already visited him at his house in Dubai shortly after his arrival On the 4th December, I accompanied ? r.Jackson to Timm al 0,atwain and Has al* jrhaimah and introduced him to the respective Shaikhs. * 4. The Geophysical Party pitched their tents 5 miles south of jabal Ali and 3 miles far from the Coast. During the month of November they completed geophysical On the 12th November, a minor incident tookwork on a strin of land extending 40 kilometres inland, starting from v 7adi al Bat-ha (on the Has al iQiaimah-l ;nni al Oaivrain border) southards to the present Camp site, thus cover inn; the whole areas of TJmm al oawain, A,iman-&gt; Sharjah and the majority of Dubai. I'r.Ballon who is in charge of the triangulation survey has completed work in Timm al o,nwain and Ajman areas and will now be starting work in Sharjah, Dhaid and Has al Kha5.mah. 5 # as the Geophysical Party were getting prepared to b&lt; 3 »in‘ work in Abu Dhabi territory, Itr.Jackson decided to go to Abu Dhabi in order to introduce himself to the Shaikh and to obtain miards and guides to accompany the Party during their impending operations. On the 29th November he left for Abu Dhabi by road, in two cars, taking a letter of introduction fro^ me to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi nnd also another letter from me asking the Shaikh to supnly the \ necessary guards and guides. Unfortunately as Mr.Jacksons»s car reached a place called Habl al Farida, about 60 miles from the Camp right into Abu Dhabi territory, a group of Manasir tribesmen estimated to be about 100 men fired several shots on the car. As the firing continued the drive’*'* stonned the car, jumned out and waved his head- * 1 kerchief calling upon them, to cease firing but they did not do so. The car had thus to turn round as it was impossible to go any further. Mr.Jackson then proceeded to Sharjah and came pnd reported the matter to me and asked my opinion as to the quickest and safest way of getting to Abu Dhabi. I advised him to go by launch, to which course he agreed, and promised to give him a letter to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi protesting, in strong terms, against this incident which took place in his territory. He left by launch the same evening reaching Abu Dhabi next morning. On the 1st December, T paid a visit to the Camp and soon after my arrival, T n.Jackson arrived there from Abu Dhabi bringing with him nine guards and guides and/-(jti) * //¥ - 3 - and the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi r s ret)l Tr to ray letter. Copies (-ith translations) of ray letter and the shaikh’s reply thereto, are enclosed for your information. Tie reported t.o me that the Shaikh expressed his deep reyret for vrhat had happened and assured him that no similar incident will take place in future. (News had already reached the Shaikh that it was the Shaikh of Dubai’s car that was fired on and that one of its occupants was seriously wounded!) The Shaikh’s contention that only two or three persons did actually fire on the car is, according to Fr.Jackson, quite untrue, as more than SO bullets were simultaneously fired. m he Shaikh of Abu Dhabi tried to discuss the boundary question with Fr.Jackson but the latter avoided giving him any definite reply on the subject and told him that the matter is one that concerns me and not the Company. Thereupon the Shaikh gave Fr.Jackson a letter addressed to me on the subject, a copy of which (with translation) is enclosed. In ray opinion it would be better not to send the Shaikh any reply on the subject of the boundary at this stage. 6 * As work in Dubai area is nearly finished, the Dubai guards have been dispensed with with the exception of three (1 headguard and 2 guards).

I confirm that I set out from our camp near Jebel Ali by car on the morning of 29 November 1946, accompanied by my driver and one other company vehicle containing 3 occupants fall company employees) -nd that at a place called Habb al Farida about 30 km. from the camp and inside^Abu Dhabi territory my car, which was proceeding, met T ' r ifh rifle fire, which T observed to come from the direction of a large bod^ r of men, stationed across the road about^3 or 4.hundred yards ahead. I further confirm that my ^driver at once stooped the car and .lumping out waved his '’effiya vigorously in the air, at the same time calling noon then to cease firing, as they were shooting at a company car. The firing however continued and as shots began to fall at both sides of the car, my driver rapidly turned round and with bullets still whistling over the ton of the car, T returned to a point about one mile back along the noad, ^where the other vehic3.e had fortunately stopoed on observing that my car had turned round. I further confirm that on alighting from my vehicle T observed that the attackers were advancing towards us still firing shots in our direction and that t at^once gave orders to return to camp, on reaching which T left the other vehicle and nroceeded to gharjah to renort' the incident to you.

After the usual greetings he told me, that he had just learned thnt the cars stopped and shot at yesterday by his men were Company vehicles and that he was extremely sorry that this had happened. T then gave him the letter you had written to him on the subject and after reading it, again began his apologies with particular reference to the fact that I had been involved. His plea was that the men responsible were ignorant bedu and that they knew nothing about our Company vehicles. He also volunteered the information that their ’rais* was in any case absent in Abu Dhabi at the time, that they numbered in all about 400 and were drawn from the tribe of the Hunasir. Their presence at TTabb al Parida was due to the state of tension how existing between Dubai and Abu Dhabi. use and that it was his responsibility to see that his bedu did fully understand that Company vehicles were liable to be coming to the area. I reminded him that our interpreter Hohd.Abdur Rahman had visited him some 3 weeks before to advise him that our geophysicists would be working in his area in the very near future and would be reouiring guards from him for that purpose. He had moreover been informed of my intention of visiting him at the end of the month, T emphasised that it was his responsibility to see that in the future no Company tyar was fired upon or even held up and that they (the geophysicists) were permitted to carip 7- on their work without any let or hindrance. He gave me a full promise that he would see that this was done and that the men responsible for the incident of the previous day were properly Punished. He further assured me that this large body of men had already been moved fron the vicinity of the road, hereupon T pointed out to him that our party in their work moved’with consider 0 ble speed not only along main roads and tracks, but everywhere they required to go for the Purposes of their survey and that he must expect to hear of their movements not only down the coast but also everywhere'for a distance of 40 km.inland. He stated that he understood this and would see that all bedu were at once informed and instructed never to interfere. I then informed him that I wished to take 9 guards back with me that evening, since our party was anxious to begin work in Abu Dhabi territory in the next few days. He at first agreed unreservedly, but on learning the exact site of our camp stated that we* were already in Abu Dhabi territory, since as far as he was concerned, Jebel Ali was the boundary. I told him that the camp had The Shaikh himself came down to receive me in the In reply I told him that apologies were of littleus was its conYenience as an HO,, fron v/hich to work and that so far we had not been working Abu Dhabi territory. He then objected to the nresence of Dubai guards in what he claimed to be his territory. I replied that they were there on your instructions for work in Dubai territory. He then required of me an assurance that Dubai guards never accompanied the geophysicists when they were working south of the camn or west.. T Tien I told him that Dubai guards wore only used for Dubai territory, he further objected that you had not told him anything about this arrangement to have Dubai guards in the camp and asked that they be moved to Jebel Ali. To this I answered that the speed of our working required that we had always ready guards of whatever territories we were working in. After a few further objections and answers, he finally agreed to supply j the guards. , T returned to our camn with the guards by launch on the morning of the next day. In conclusion, I should like to inform you of a renort that my messenger brought on his return from’ present ing my letter of introduction. He reports that he was asked by Shaikh Khalid, brother of the Ruler, whether he had heard anything in Dubai about a raid made the da^ before in two cars by Shaikh Rashid bin Said of Dubai and whether it was known that before the cars were driven off one had been hit and probably one of its occupants injured seriously. I can further assure you that the Ruler f s allegation, made personally to me and I believe also to you in writing, that only three persons actually fired shots, is a sheer fabrication, as I have the testimony of my ov/n eyes and also of my driver, that before my car s bopped at least 20 bullets hit the ground simultaneously before us.

Incidents involving Company Employees. 1 . I reyret to have to inform you of a further incident of a company vehicle’s being fired unon. 2. The car of one of our geonhysicists was fired unon twice by unseen assailants at a point about 36 kilometres due east of our Jebel Ali Camp. The car was accompanied by a Dubai guard. The geophysicist concerned at once dismounted and standing on a sand dune made signals with his arms in the direction of the firing. Immediately a body of armed men, which he estimated at about forty in number, appeared in sight and made signs to indicate that he and his party should move away. 1 'hen he stood his ground, one of the body came forward and on ascertaining who the partvwas, apologised, stating that he had supposed then to have been sent by Rashid bin Said. It was then discovered that the party were all of the ? 'unasir tribe under one ’ T ohd.bin Haleba. It was further understood that they were raiding into Dubai territory. Our party then continued on its way. 3. Shortly afterwards another geophysicist and his party saw this sane body of raiders in the sane area. ' 1 he Abu Dhabi guard, who was accompanying him, was so overcome by fear that he violently pulled the driver’s arm and continued to do so until the driver was compelled to turn round and return to camp. This incident caused the loss of a whole day’s work. 4. Another geophysicist saw this same party later on in the morning but their only reaction was to stand and watch him as he vr ent by. 5. While I an convinced that it only requires the local people to become used to seeing our cars, I feel sure that you will agree with me that these incidents are contrary to the assurances given me recently by the Ruler of Abu Dhabi. I also feel that this situation of raid and counter-raid can only produce a worsening of the atmosphere of the area and an increase of suspicion, tinder such circumstances the speed and efficiency of our work is likely to suffer. You will also appreciate that the action of the guard, described in para.3, was not only ridiculous but definitely obstructive to our work. Kis action was contrary to the purnose for which we agreed to have these guards and in the event of a recurrence of such behaviour, we shall be compelled to regard these tribal guards as a menace to our interests. While I hope that every day will make it easier for our geophysicists to work in this difficult area, I should be very grateful’for•any advice and assistance you can give us in the matter. Sd.

I write to inform you of two regrettable incidents that occurred to the Geophysical Party on Wednesday the 4th December equivalent to the 9th Wuharram. The first incident is that when one of the party’s vehicles stopped at a spot about 20 miles east of Tabal Ali, it was fired upon by a force composed of about 50 men of the T anasir, Beni Yas and other tribes of yours under the command of I'uhammad Bu Halaiba. when the geophysicist dismounted and made signals to them with his arms, the headman Bu Halaiba came forward and anologised to him for the aggression done. ^he second incident is that another vehicle of the party left on the same day for another snot with one of your guards. As the vehicle reached a point in the vicinit 7 ,r of the same area and the gua.rd saw some bedouins at some distance, he prevented the car from continuing the journey and forced the driver to return to the Gann. He was greatly terrified and by his action made the Party' lose a whole day’s work. . I went personally to the Camn this morning and interrogated the guard concerned. His plea is that he saw a group of bedou ns and fearing ~hat they might turn to be Dubai subjects, he preferred to keen away from them. This plea is not convincing as he did not make sure who the said bedouins were; he was overcome by fear the moment he observed some bedouins ao a distance. 'I’hese bedouins might well have been Huhammad Bu Halaiba’s party. 0’ Shaikh I I deem, it necessary to point out to you that these two incidents fully contradict your promise to me to help the geophysical party and facilitate their work in your area, and I regret to inform you that if you do not take all effective measures to nut a stop to such unpleasant incidents which would only lead to the obstruction of the party’s work, the party will decide to abandon work in your territory, which would result in loss io ^ r ou. ^ It is not sufficient to make promises but what is really imnortant is to fulfil such promises and carry out the obligations in a most; satisfactory way. I leave vou to appreciate the importance of this'matter and hone'to hear favourably from you. Usual Ending.b' L !

He informed the Shaikh of this and requested him to reply on the lines of a draft which T r r. Jackson sent him. He also requested the Shaikh to provide yuards from the Jazirat al Hamra tribes, because he suspected that the Shaikh had not settled with them, in suite of his ass-urances to the eontrary. 3.

He continued that he required prior information so that he could himself accompany the parties during their operations on the borders of his territory.

A settlement has been reached between the Shaikh of Ra$ al Khnimah and the Shaikh of Jazirat al Hamra, who has agreed to allow the Company to operate in his territory. Details of the settlement are not yet available. 3. the On the 6th of February both the Residency A^ent and Company’s Representative recdved letters from Ali bin Obaid bin Miftah, Paramount Chief of the Khav/atir, saying that he had agreed with the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah to protect Company personnel working in his area and enquiring the reason for the delay in their arrival* Mr. Jackson called on me on the 7th and said that he was quite satisfied with the arrangements, and that the Company would start working in the Khawatir area on the 9th February. 4. On the 10th, however, when the Company’s engineers went to work in the Khawatir area one of them was expelled by Ali bin Obaid’s men and was told that they would not be allowed to work there because the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah had not yet settled with Ali bin Obaid. This had a very bad effect on the morale of the American engineers, who' do not take readily to being threatened or interfered with, their attitude being that they are paid to survey and not to be threat ened or shot at. 5* On the 11th February, Mr. Jackson approached me for help and advice. I had arranged to pay a visit to Ras-al- Khaimah on the 13th in any case to call on the Shaikh, so I put forward the visit and went yesterday. The Shaikh of Ras- al-Khaimah sent his lorry to fetch Ali bin Obaid and Ali bin Saif from the desert, and it was soon obvious that the trouble was solely due to the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah’s having avoided recording in writing the agreement reported in my letter of the 1st February, and to his not having paid the money. I therefore made it quite clear to the Shaikh of Ras-al- Khaimah at noon - without letting the Khawatir Shaikhs know, lest they should become more intractable - that he had until 4. r.. m . to settle with the Khawatir: and that, if he failed to do so, it would be necessarv for the Company to revise their exploration programme and to leave his area unexplored for an indefinite period. He therefore retired with the Khawatir to negotiate. In a very short time he returned with them and announced that all was settled. The points of agreement were stated by him seriatim to me and to the Residency Agent in the presence of the Khawatir, who agreed to them. He then produced a document written by his son purporting to record the points of agreement, and asked the Khawatir to sign it in my presence. When, at the Residency Agent’s suggestion, the document was read over to them, however, it was found to be entirely different from the points verbally explained and was immediately repudiated by the Khawatir. I suggested that they should again retire and record the points of agreement more accurately/-w accurately. A good deal of altercation followed at the top* of their voices, which could be heard all over the fort, and the negotiations were followed with understanding interest by the bedouin sitting outside. No progress, however, was made in drafting the agreement. Eventually at 3.30 p.m. invited the Shaikh of R n s al IChaimah to infoimi me how far agreement had been reached; and I found that all the important points h^d been settled. J accordingly had them recorded in writing: and, when the document had been read over point by point and accepted by both parties, they signed it in mv presence.^ jrb substantially the same as the agreement reported in my letter of the 1st February', except' that the time of pavment of the amounts has been specified. A copy of the agreement in translation is attached. ^ To present a recurrence of the present trouble arisi] from the Shaikh , s failure to pay the amounts previously agreed upon, I then asked when the first instalmebt wouldbe paid. The Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah said first within two days then within*' ten; but Ali bin Obaid, armed with his document, seemed to have lost interest in immediate payment and stated to the Shaikh in my presence that he was now fully satisfied and would not again interfere with the Company’s work. Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah appears to be prepared to po to almost ^*1^ procrastination and dissimulation to avoid part ing ’ith cash. Fe even alleged to the Khawatir that he had no money, and would be reduced by their intransigence to pawning his gold ornaments. unimportant tribe under the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah, had stnted that he would not allow the Company to work in his area. The Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah was informed of this anrK- s-p^o-r. 7. I left the matter at that; but I shall be very surprised if the first instalment is paid within ten days.

The Shaikh of Pas al Khaimah had written to the Company’s representative on the morning of the 14th saying that all was arranged with the Ghafalah for the Company’s work. When in the afternoon, however, the incident with the bedouin was brought to his notice, the Shaikh changed his ground and denied that the area occupied by the chafalah was within his territory. He produced a map depicting his boundaries, which, however, he refused to sign or to allow me to place on record. He alleged that the area concerned was in the Shaikh of Uimn al Qaiwain territory.

The Company’s engineers were turned out of the Ghafalah MFP—501 S&amp;P—(M-8^0)—23-7-36—300,000. which/-which the upshot was that, at the cost to the Company of another day’s work, the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah was given yesterday in which to arrange for them to work in the area occupied by the Ghafalah. A company car was provided to enable him to see the Shaikhs, and yesterday evening in Ras al Khaimah he stated to me (gm and to the Company’s representative, in the presence of Tsa bin Musabbih and his relative Sai’d - Shaikhs of the Ghafalah, whom he had brought with him to Ras al Khaimah that the necessary arrangements had been made. The Ghafalah Shaikhs also supplied guards to accompany the surveyors, who have gone there to-day. On my way to Ras al Khaimah yesterday morning I had called on the Shaikh of Umm al Qaiwain and had asked him in whose limits the area occupied by the Ghafalah was situated. He had replied that it was not within his limits; but had volunteered - having probably heard of the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah T s difficulties - that, if he was asked in writing to do so, he would quickly settle with the Ghafalah and facilitate the Company’s work there. Recent experience has shown that shaikh of Ras al Khaimah had done little in advance to arrange for the Company’s work, probably in the hope that the Company would settle with his tribes direct or that Government would use its influence to overawe them without cost to him - he tried unsuccessfully to get me or the Residency Agent to accompany him to the Ghafalah country and I shall be surprised if the Company complete their survey of his area, if there is one more incident, the Americans will almost certainly refuse to continue to work there. These stoppages of work - there have already been three - are, T understand, extremely expensive for the Company; and they have been caused, in my view, directly by the ShaikhV lack of control of his tribes and by his parsimony. The amounts involved in the Shaikh’s negotiations have been trivial indeed compared/-- 3 - compared with his concession money (only Rs.500/- remained in dispute between him and the Khawatir, and the amount involved with the Ghafalah was probably less); while the loss of three days 1 work which resulted probably cost the Company Rs.15,000/- or more. 5. The incident reported in paragraph 9 of my memorandum of the 13th February has been settled by the Shaikh of Sharjah; but there are already indications that, for all his pomps and poses, his writ does not run any more effectively than that of his cousin the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah* j/W .

He agreed to do so but in the after noon sent word that he was unwilling to come. The same afternoon when-Mr.Jackson’s car was approaching a Hira tower overlooking the main Sharjah-Ajman road, a guard on the tower stopped the car. Mr.Jackson reported this incident to the Shaikh of Sharjah who promised to deal with the Shaikh of Hira. 2. The Shaikh of Hira was twice invited to come to this Agency to discuss the letter he sent to the Residency Agent and twice refused. T propose, if you have no objection, to withhold his sugar and tea quotas until he comes to apologize. /ya - Conli: jstial. BAHRAIN RECEIPT. He. .3.A. •Date...

The Ghafalah occupy dune area in Ras al Khaimah territory including Harma and Haraimlah dunes and Tawi Samha well, about 40 square miles in all. Musabbih family are under Ras al Khaimah and Hadhroom family, though living in Ras al Khaimah territory, are under protection of Beni Qitab. The Ghafalah consist of about 50 families in all. During a week of most protracted negotiations it was impressed upon Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah ad nauseam that it was in his interest to prevent stoppages of work by bedouin; but the facts are that Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah has not the power to overawe them and is too mean to pay them. He had, I am afraid, to learn his lesson the hard way and is now more actively trying to get the Company to return - my express letter No.c/214.0630 of the 23rd February, 1947 refers.

Reference correspondence resting with ray telegram No.229 dated the 26th February, 1947. 2 # Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah delayed going to fetch Muhammad bin Ali until this morning. Meanwhile, the Shaikh of Dubai, hearing that the Shaikh of Sharjah had accused him of instigating Muhammad bin Ali to obstruct the Company*s work, sent Muhammad bin Ali to the Residency Agent at 10.00 p.m. last night. Muhammad bin Ali told me that there was nothing between him and Shaikh of Sharjah but a question of money, Sharjah having paid him nothing for his promise to facilitate the Company*s work. When he did not send the Beni qitab guards, Sharjah had sent for him four times and he had refused to visit Sharjah. He continued that he^would deal with Sharjah no longer, but that he would do anything the Government or the Company desired of him. I impressed upon him that we would not deal direct with him, and that he should settle with the Shaikh of Sharjah. This he adamantly refused to do, or even to go to see him. He added that nothing less s. 6. MFP— 601 S&amp; P—(M.-8‘t50)—23-7-38—300,000. frOITl/-from Sharjah than Rs.40,000/- in two instalments of Rs.20,000/ one now and another after 12 months - would satisfy him. He was instructed to come again to the Agency this morning. 3. Before Muhammad bin Ali arrived Sharjah was contacted. He was dressed and armed for the desert, preparing to go with the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah to see Muhammad bin Ali* Hearing that he was coming to the Agency, Sharjah gladly agreed to meet him here. I impressed upon him that he now had what might be his last chance to settle with the Beni Qitab; and that he should take it. T warned him of the grave consequences that might follow if he failed to facilitate the Company’s work; and, to his argument that Dubai was behind Tmhammad bin Ali’s demands, I replied that, whatever the cause, he now had to face the facts. 4. The two parties were then invited to settle their differences privately, and after half an hour of bickering they failed to do so. Muhammad bin Ali then reiterated to me his demand for direct dealings with the Company, and it appears that the Shaikh of Sharjah also had suggested this to him. This T refused to Muhammad bin Ali. To the Shaikh of Sharjah I said separately that direct dealings with the Beni Oitab would probably suit the Company much better than the present arrangement but that for years we had recognized him as the overlord of the Beni Qitab and had resisted such suggestions as being opposed to his interests. T added that, if ever he forced us to negotiate direct with the Beni Oitab, it would almost certainly be at the expense of his present concession, and that he should be the last person to suggest to his dependent Shaikhs the idea of their dealing direct with the Company. They were then invited to meet again on this understanding, and again failed even to approach agreement, Sharjah complaining that the Beni Qitab demands were outrageous. Muhammad bin Ali on the other hand was insistent that either Sharjah should pay him Rs.40,000 or that Beni Qitab territory should be regarded as closed to the Company. 5. To Mtihammad bin Ali I made it quite clear (i) that we would not countenance direct dealings between him and the Company/Company; (ii) that I wished to hear no more talk of Beni Qitab country being closed to the Company - adding that we had done a lot for the Beni Qitab and would have to reconsider our attitude, in conjunction with Sharjah, if he obstructed a Company that we had snonsored and (iii) that he must settle with Sharjah* In reply he offered to accept my arbitration. r ^° Sharjah T said (i) that he had received annual payments at the rate of Rs*30,000 plus ex-gratia payments of Rs.10,000 a year for nine years without being asked to do / anything except facilitate last year f s survey (which he admitted had cost him only Bs.7,500/-); (ii) that it was now up to him to show that he had control of the area for which he had given a concessionj (iii) that the Beni Qitab occupied three quarters of his territory, were his only big tribe, and were, indeed, his only important subjects; and (iv) that they appeared to have complete control of the area in which they lived, that in the absence of power to overawe them he had no alternative but to pay them, and that he would be lucky to get their co-operation for two payments of Rs.15,000/-* He agreed to pay up to this amount if necessary. ^ * T f hen they again failed to agree by themselves, X first asked Sharjah to agree to pay two sums of Rs.15,000/-, and then asked Muhammad bin Ali to facilitate the Company’s work for these sums. After a good deal of argument both agreed and signed the agreement enclosed in translation. This agreement supersede^ a previous agreement relating to last year’s survey, for which payment of Rs.7,500/- had only just been completed. The clause relating to income from oil was incorporated from the former agreement. Sharjah paid Muhammad bin Ali Rs.15,000/- in my presence. 8 * Muhammad bin Ali produced three guards in Sharjah and promised to send three more from the desert. He left immediately for Beni Qitab country. The Company will continue working tomorrow. It is possible that there is something in Sharjah’s charge/-- 4 - /a charge against Dubai - though Dubai emphatically denies it but it is more likely that his cousin’s settlement with the Khawatir, a much less powerful tribe than the Beni Q,itab, excited * Muhammad bin Ali’s greed. In any case, if Sharjah has suffered at the hands of Dubai, he has received no more than his deserts for he has lost no opportunity to embarrass Dubai in the Abu Dhabi affair. Had Sharjah paid Muhammad bin Ali when he first visited him on the 22nd February, he could probably have got his co-operation for half the amount finally agreed upon. 74-) M ■ if itTranslation* Agreement reached between Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, Ruler of Sharjah and Shaikh Muhammad bin Ali bin Huwaidin, Chief of the Beni qi^ab tribe for himself and on behalf of his people whereby Shaikh Sultan agrees to pay the said Muhammad bin Ali a sum of Rs.15,000/- now and Rs.15,000/- after twelve months from the date of this agreement and also to give him one third of the nett income arising from any oil found.

I have also had to urge the dependent Shaikhs to moderate their demands and, when pressed by them to do so, to agree to witness the signing of written agreements with their Rulers. 4.

The Shaikh of Sharjah again sent his Secretary on the 27th February to the Shaikh of Hira with an offer of Rs.4,000/- a yeafc but the latter refused this offer and said that he would not accept less than Rs.8,000/- a year. On the 28th February Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, Ruler of Ras al Khaimah, tried unsuccessfully to reach a settlement. 3. On the evening of the 2nd March a guard in one of the Hira towers fired a shot in the air to stop a car. On finding that the car ms the Company’s and not the Shaikh of Sharjah’s, allowed it to A pass. Mr.Jackson approached the Shaikh of Sharjah yesterday morning and reported this incident to him. I advised Mr.Jackson that his Company’s men should make a wide detour to avoid tho roads and towers because Hira has only 6 men and no cars and is unable to stop them except on the main tracks where he has posted men.

The Shaikh of Sharjah has sounded a number of Sharjah’s notables on their attitude should he initiate hostilities against Hira. T understand that he got no encouragement, their attitude being that Hira is his brother-in-law and that he should treat his family dependants more generously than in the past. 5. ^he Shaikh of Hira expressed his willingness to come to the Agency and asked for the Agency car to be sent fofc him. He fears to come to Sharjah in any other vehicle knowing that the Shaikh of Sharjah would arrest him if he could. I refused to send the Agency car for him; and the fact that he cannot come here, apologize, and get his sugar quota - hitherto^only source of income - until he first settles with Sharjah should be an additional incentive for him bo do. 4 The Shaikh of Sharjah yesterday requested the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah.GOVERNMENT OP INDIA, Dkpabtmbkt, EXPRESS LETTER [A’ . —This is an ORIGINAL MESSAGE, sent by post to save telegraphic expense and undue use of the wires, but intended to be treated, on receipt, with the same expedit ion as if it had been telegraphed.

I understand that in their operations from Dhaid some of the Company’s surveyors have again been working in Ghafalah and Khawatir territories and have not been obstructed. In view of the Beni Qitab settlement and Muhammad bin All’s request for the Company to return to chafalah country, I do not anticipate any difficulties. The surveyors move so fast and have so little to do in the area that T do not now propose to advertise their operations by calling in Ghafalah Shaikhs again unless they are first obstructed. 3. The Shaikh of Has al Khaimah has not yet, however, paid to the Khawatir Shaikhs-the instalment mentioned in para .6 of my express letter No.166.06^0 of the 13th February.

Confidential. BAHRAIN RECEIPT. Confidential. No. C/262.0630 Dated 5th March, 1947. m Yesterday when travelling between the Company’s Camp at Dhaid and Jabal Fayah Mr .Brookes with two Company cars was held up by a gang of armed robbers at a point south of Jabal Rodha. 2. They demanded money from him but he denied, quite untruly, that he had any with him. After a good deal of talk, their leader suggested that one car remain and one be sent back to the Camp to fetch something for them. Mr.Brookes said that he had no money in camp either, but that he had a number of Beni Qitab guards there who would certainly come out when they heard what was afoot. 3 # Eventually the gang allowed the cars to proceed, Mr .Brookes having parted with nothing more than a packet of cigarettes and a box of matches. The main party were in hiding; but he reported seeing 5 men and 5 camels. 4. The leader of the gang, one Hilal al Harsusi of the Awamir was recognized by the Company’s Beni qitab guards, to whom he is known. The Awamir are notorious robbers who live south of Buraimi. They had approached Beni Qitab country through Abu Dhabi, although there is no reason to suppose that Abu Dhabi inspired them. The fact that the Beni Qitab have been allied with Dubai will, however, make it difficult for them to pursue the Harasi^ through Abu Dhabi. I shall mention this case to Abu Dhabi to-morrow. 5. Mr.Jackson reported the incident to the Shaikh of Sharjah the same evening, remarking, not without relish, that, with the Dhaid road closed by Hira and robber gangs at large in the Jabal Fayah area, the senior officials of the Company expected here to-day would not get a very happy impression of the Shaikh’s control over the area for which he had given them a concession. The Shaikh is reported to have replied to these sallies with a good deal of ’Insha’llah’ and unusually s 6 prolonged attention to the evening prayer. / / //tv — * \1TTD cm C 1) /H4 o OO rr oc oaa r ^ // MFP—50i 6&lt;fcP—(M.-820)—23-7-36—300,000. political Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah.2 , • Sharjah - Hira dispute settled without hostility and without our intervention.

The area to be examined during 1948/49 will be from the actual main mountain range westwards as far as is found practicable. The visit of our representative this season would be mainly concerned with making contacts with the various chiefs and notables and with the aid of a little largesse to obtain promises for the right to enter and explore during 1948/49.

The party in four vehicles proceeded by the northern crack and returned by the southern route. The survey as far as Tawi 2aia on the northern track was carried out from the iii&amp;in camp at hiabet Shakhbut. The eastern half of the southern track v*as workec from the base (Jahli) in the oasis. The party was based on Jahli for five days. While so based the party Vvorked to the northern, eastern ana southern limits of Abu Dhabi territory in the oasis, ho difficulties were encountered either from transport or the terrain and the survey was carried out with great speed. I proceeded in aavance of the party to Abu Dhabi, where 1 advised Shaikh Shakhbut of our proposed survey and then to Lumwejeh, where I paid my respects to Shaikh 2aid. For convenience I took up my quarters in the Jahli fort. In accordance with the instructions of the Residency AgenC, I made the first appx*oach to Shaikh saqr bin Sultan. Z&amp;id also agreed chat this was advisable. I regret however that in spite of persevering for six aays I was not able to come to terms with Saqr, who throughout uhe discussions made it clear chat he was not interested in a few hours work or even a'few cays ana that nothing short of a concession woula satisfy him. I naturally tola him the.i, I had no authority oo discuss this subject with him. Ahmed bin Saif was with him in Buraimi throughout this period. When he and Saqr told me that cheir final wora was that they should be treated like the Sheikhs on uhe coastal considered it advisable not to press the matter any further so as not po give any impression of urgency on the company* s part. The work on the east siae of Befit was therefore carried out only as far as Thamaia (the boundary claimed by Abu Dhabi about 20 km. south of A1 Ain). The northern wadis of Befit were also surveyed. Baving reconnoitreo with bhaikh 2aia by Dodge truck on the western side of Befit as far as Qabl, I deciaed that the party could work the western side of the mountain as far as Q&amp;bl. The small piece of A1 bu bhamis territory involved could be surveyed in under two hours. 1 therefore approached Shaikh Loha. bin Rahma bin Saliniin,who was at uhe uime in Bamasa with a view to obtaining his per mission. When the subject was eventually raised, he amazea me by asking for Rs. 10000. I could not resist, the temp tat ic to reply thau we did not wish to buy his area, only to work a small strip for about uwo hours. When after three days ir spite of Zaid*s very consicerable assistance, I was unable to reduce -him even to the limit you gave me, I deciced that the small area concern* was not in the.circumstances so important to the party, mr. Colley agreea with my view. Zaid was considerably disturbed by his father-in-law*s unreasonable attituae and blamed 3aqr*s influence. The party therefore surveyea as far as 5ha*ab al Ghaf,which is claimed by Shakhbut as his frontier on the west siae of Hsfit. to ho time w&amp;e lost/the party through these negotiations. 1 returned to Dubai on 2t&gt;th October 47. Yours sincerely, sd. H.M.JACKSONCopy. C!OMFIDEt.TlAL . D0/i.b^pL/37a Duo^ti, 12 tJi November 47 Dear kr. Lemiitte, I have to infonri you that on my return irom Buraimi on hovember 47 i received a letter from Shaikh Shakhbut aaking me to come and see him aa soon as possible# 1 was unable to go to him until tcoay. Among thie many points discussed the following ire the most important. (a) ho has been informed that our company in Qatar are planning to buila a terminal at katalid, which he claims bo be in his territory. He asked me to confirm or deny ti-at this is so. I replied truthfully that I have no information on this subject nor indeed on any of the activities of Petroleum Development (Qatar;. I pointed out haw ever that the question of frontiers is no concern of an oil company. With Lhis he ©greed but asked me to refer the matter to you. 1 should in any case be glad to know as soon as possible what reply to make in the almost certain event of his raising the subject ©gain. (b) He once again raised the i^vit&amp;ble subject of the speed of our operations. I replied that I had nothing further to say on this subject other than what I had already told him on so many previous occasions, he then went on to say that he definitely v k as not satisfied that we were going ahead as fast ©s we might, that ’our few months survey work each year' was not in the spirit of the concession,and that he wanted a definite statement as to when we woulo begin drilling operations. In replfcr I told him that 1 had no authority nor inaeed one requisite knowledge to speak on this subject and once again i tried to convince him of the hecessity of our making a careful and detailed survey of his area ana how such a careful survey was to his ultimate advantage. He asked me to make his views known to the company ana request them to reply. I informed him that I would pass on what he liad told me to you. 1 must sta^e that on this question Shakhbut seems to be forced into speaking thus by his brothers I-iza’ and Khalid,neither of whom can think rationally on any subject.I should hov/ever be glad to hear your views. (cj The third question is one raised on several occasions previously, the question of the pay of bAin guards. 1 have always replied that the Pvs.2 per day in the field is a stanoard rate fixed by the company ana approved of by the local Political Office. You may recall that we had trouble last season on the same question and that in all cases it was satisfactorily seitled with the help of the Residency Agent. I have no doubt that if it becomes necessary we could ask for the latter* s essistsaice again. Shakhbut however as you know is no fool anu argues that wages all over the world have gone up as a result of the rise in the cost of living and that therefore logically his guaro^ wages should go up. This question too he has now asked me to put to the company, since I have tola him that the matter is entirely outside my authority. Perhaps you might let me Lave something final on this question as well. In conclusion I would like to say tliat knowing shakhbut ana his brothers Hiza* ana KLalia as I go • i- make a pointer going as little as possible to Atu Dhabi unless I have some definite business. As a result however of our present work it has been Impossible for me to avoid paying rather rusrejfrequent visits. Further in defence ol Shakhbut*s present ettituae I should like to say that the situation as a result of th£ closing of the pearl trade and the cutting off by the politicel Authorities of Temv''eupplies in his area is tragic. The population of Abu Dhsbi has dwindled to a handful ana the bazaar is reaucea to one shop selling aetes. There is little wonder that shakhbut and hie brothers regard the oil develo^oient in their are© as tiie only hope anu cliafe at what appears to them in their i^iiOranee as unnecessary delays* hor need I tell you that the party works in his area in complete freedom tna security without any interference of any kind. In viev of our experiences in bharjah and Has al knaimah areas last season the surveyors find their present situation remarkable# I am sending a copy of this letter to the Residency Agent, Sharjah# R.h.

Please see my note on the Jabal Faiyah at P .114 et seo. I see PCL f s letter was handed to the Shaikh of Sharjah on the 20 th October, over one month ago, and that he has been unable to arrange anything to date. Shaikh Mohd bin fill of the ^ani Oitsb was in Shapjah/T)ubai on the 21 st October when I was there. I visualised in ray previous note that he would be incapable or unw r illing to do anything and T am sure he never will reach a compromise with the Peni oitab. To my, mind it is merely a question of ho^ r long we give him to go on procrastinating and before we call the bluff of the ngwasim ' as represented by him (and the others eventually). . I see you in 1917 in consultation with Vr. Weightman the then P.A. contemplated three possible courses of action (P. 17 b) (a) r Taking Shaikh Sultan to Shaikh Pohd and trying to arrange matters between the two. (b) . Shaikh fhalid of Kalba arranging a meeting between you and Shaikh Pohd. (c) . fin approach through Shaikh Pashid of Pjman. I think our relations vis a vis the Fgni Oitab have altered considerably since 1937 and also relations bet'een uhe latter and the Bulers. I feel sure it would be a mistake for us to promote a meeting between Shaikh Sultan of Sharjah and Shaikh Mohd. of tLe ^ani Qitab and I think that course was not considered entirely satisfactory in 1937 because it would tend to give the impression of coercing a de facto ruler (Sh. ,# ohd.T to come to terms with one w r e have accepted (rightly or wrongly) as the de jure ruler. Peggrding the second and third alternatives of enlisting the services of Shaikhs Khalid or Pashid, again I think that with the friendly relations and closer connections of 1945 between us and the Pani oitab shaikhs we would, be ill advised to enlist any help from two nonentities like ShaikhKhalid and Pas'id both oT whoso inriuGenco nLw r adavs is negligible. TtiO questi l n tlien is to decide whet other courses remain open to us in the changed conditions now existent. T see M r. ^eliy in his P. 0 # MoCLk&gt; c P.105 suggests thdt the Puier coulo then be held to have broken the promise of protection in /rticle 15 of t^e Concession Agreement, but T am not, certain^that our telling him so would help very much, and I would prefer to hold that /'rticle 10 of the Political Agreement, applies. The relevant articles of the Concession and Political Agreement are (a.). Concess on Agreement. - Article C of Schedule 1 ? Until the Shaikh permits the Company in writing • the Company may not enter for the present nor undertake any work in the two areas named /'1-Fayah and T ' T adi Al- TJ ulu. f If you will excuse my animadverting on this particular article for a mdupent, I cannot understand how it was ever included in the Concession because these areas for certainly the former) are precisely those over which Sharjah’s claim to Suzerainty is of extremely doubtful validity de ^ure and de iacto of none. They were obviously inserted by Shaikh Sultan for precisely those reasons and one can see s^ clearly the working of his mind when doing so. .It is indeed fortunate that all the rulers on the ^rucial Coast have not minds of such a tortuous nature as Shaikh) Multan’s as otherwise -we might have a similar embargo included in shaikh Said of Pubai’s concession regarding Phor Ghanadha with equally complicated results.* The inclusion of this article was a triumph for shaikh Sultan and presumably only accepted because the Company were anxious to conclude the agreement at all costs.(b). Political Agreement. - .Article 10 ' The Company shall obtain the prior permission of the Shaikh before working in any particular area, in order that the Shaikh may be in a position to fulfill his responsibilities for the protection of the Company. ^he Shaikh shall not unreasonably withhold such permission, smd in any case in 'which the Company feels that the free movement of its personnel within the xk concession area is beinf unnecessarily restricted the matter shall be referred for decision to the Political Resident. 1 ’ Other Articles wl ich have a bearing on this question are i (c) . Concession Agreement. - Article 1. ” The area to which this Agreement applies is the Ctate of Sharjah including all islands and territorial waters appertaining thereto (herein- % after referred to as ’’the State”) being ell that territory included in the sheikhdom of Cherjah. The chaikh agrees that when the territorial limits of the ctate of Sharjah have been determined the area covered by the Concession will be coterminous with the limits so determined.” (d) . Concessions Agreement. - Article 4. ”If hereafter any neutral zone is created adjacent to the territory of the State, wherein the Shaikh shall have a co-equal and joint interest, the /6.4. shaikh hereby agrees to grant to the Company an oil concession over such neutral zone on terms , ho be agreed between the Shaikh, the Company and the joint ruler of such neutral zone. In my opinion, then, we should now give Shaikh Sultan of Sharjah a definite date by which he must give the Company written permission to visit the Jabal Faiyeh and assurance of protection as asked for by them in their letter at p.158. VV \ • I suggest we should do this beceuse for reasons I shall give later I think we should exert the authority which we undoubtedly posses as a result of our war time activities on the ^rucial n oast. At the same time I ti ink we should warn him (shaikh Multan) that if he.is unable to do so within the specified time we shall inform the Company that he will be considered to have unreasonably witheld or been unable to obtain such permission and that the provisxons of Article 10 of the political Agreement will be held to apply. It then remains to consider our next step. E&amp;vigg told Shaikh Sultan that we were instructing the ~ • Company to invoke Article 10 I think we should (his reaction will no doubt be energetic, unconstructive, devious and based on Article C of Schedule 1) then write him a further letter stating that because he had unreasonably witheld or been unable to obtain by virtue of his lack of control permission for a geological party to visit the Jabal ^siyah area we had decided to make arrangements direct ik with Shaikh M ohd. tin Ali of the Peni nitab, Moreover that he (Shaikh Sultan) had not in 1917, when asked to submit his claims in writing to ttie limits of his i boundaries, EKxfxRKi complied with our request. That in practice it was clear that he did exercise no control over that area and that we therefore reserved the right at any time in the future if events should prove it necessary to reconsider Article C of Schedule 1 of the Concession Agreement in so far as it applied to the \ Jabal Faiyah which article under the circumstances appeared to be ultra vires and inapplicable to his Honcession Agreement. tomato*d before this letter is issued to Shaikh Sultan we should contact °heikh **ohd. bin Ali and i obtain, which T am sure we would, permission for the geological party to visit the Jabal Faiyah. ^he actionmust precede the written letter tc forestall Shaikh Sultan’s inevitable intrigues, and the letter will serve tc upset his complacency to no mean extent end might even drive him into compromising at all costs with ^heikh Vf ofid. whom he knows has all the cards. Shaikh Multan ^in Saqr Buler of Sharjah, and its Independencies (as he so aptly describes his nebulous possessions at the top of his writing ^aperJ) has never dk defined the extent of his boundaries. All the other Rulers put forward in 19b7 some claim (^ee file 25/£ Vol.l). It is typical of the man he is that he alone did not do so, and I should like to revert for a moment to my remark in the lirst para of this note about the Oawasim n bluff” T,T e are more or less committed to the policy of dealing with as fev ’’rulers” de facto or de jure as oossible over oil concessions on the Crucial n oast. T,T e must however be careful of giving the impression of co-ercing the de facto ruling shaikhs into accepting the suzerainty of coastal snaikhs for whom they have no respect and whose suzerainty they have never accepted. &gt; That is the position into which Shaikh ^ultan in this particular case would very much like to drive us, and I feel we should take a very firm line to disillusion him at once. A word about Shaikh n ulten bin Sa r, ruler of Sharjah and the Oawasim as represented by him, the Regent of Kalba and tiie Ruler of Ras-al-Khamiah, may help to put the ex-pirate family in their proper perspective. Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr has with his intrigues been at the back of ail our troubles with concession negotations on the m rucial Coast e.g. the landing ground agreements,• oil concessions RK^atxxiaKxxxiaxkMKxIXKKXxix^Kxst end finally the letters of jurisdiction. Ho is the erch-intriguer as anyone who has been on the Trucial Coast knows. I don’t say he is anti-Rritish any more than any of the others bute firm ham is the only treatiDent he understands and we need never fear administering it above ell in a case like this a here the most influential tribe in his area, the ^.aiii Pitab, are the beneficaries. T think the ^awasim family (they are not r tribe ^ have outlived their usefulness (if indeed they ever had any) aiu their importance which was rendered nugatory the moment their predatory activities were curbed. I can', therefore, see no point in our tandering to their exaggerated ideas of thier own importance especially as, at a rough guess, the areas which will eventually prove to be of interest from an oil point of view will pro ably be outside the area of ' their effective control. Tuey have no wealth end what they hove is of little or no value influentially outsxde their orn families oy reason oi their despicable and dwlicrous parsimony. To my wa, ; of thinking, then, we should in future accept no '’truck’’ from any of the Oawesim and T am sure T am right in this estimate as tilings'stand at pr sent i.e. until, if ever (which I doubt), a ’’man” is born to the present croiies of the n awasim who might alter their declining destin . ^ xt only remains to c f nsider w at reaction there may be on the Trucial roast amongst other de facto rulers in the interior. It is unfortunate that the two areas in which the # Company are particularly interested as T understand it are these m which the allegiance of the tribes occupying them axe difficult to determine i.e. Jabal ^aiy&amp;h and Jabsl Hafit. I don(t think we need visualise a general refusal of shaikhs of the interior refusing to comply with requests ol the Concession rulers to allow- exploration ^ parties to visit their territories provided we work oi^,he lines suggested in ^ir Trenchard Towle’s note at P. 126 and provided presents to the tribal shaikhs are not excessive and kept as low -as possible.£3 ? srould be ^iven to understand that our direct arrangements with them in no way imply acknowledgment of exclusive or indeed any oil rights to them and we might emphasise that exclusive oil rights would in any case be impractical because the successful working of any oil deposits if found in the interior would only be possible with the provision of termini on the coast which rendered it essential that there should be co-operation between shaikhs of the interior and rulers on the coast to achieve which we were always willing to lend our sevices and could be relied upon to arbitrate fairly in both parties' interests, I do- feel that if these points were explained carefully and patiently to the shaikhs of the interior and if we * admitted our willingness to arbitrate, we could with patience make the 'bedou' see reason. One further point is that the p.O.T.C. end P.must get to know the Jabal Faiyah - - Jabal Fefit area well - and the mere they visit it tie better. w e do not know enough about it yet and,with the cessation of our liason and what T call ’■referee” activities on the aerodrome at Sharjah now that the Americans have left^ I uhink the P.O.T.C. or F.£. can spend much more time on tour round the areas inland and |pt be as restricted in faL&amp;i* movements as, for instance, T was in early 1944 when I was unreasonably^! think,prevented in spit£of numerous requests all on record on the files from even getting to Faraimi. - &lt; T think we should take 100/ advantage of cur control of the provision of foodstuffs and cloth etc. by increasing our contacts with the interior and am sure that we could get as far inland almost as we wished, . I don't like the idea' of the oil people - to use Tilliamson's terminology in one of his notes - doing what is really our work the investig tion of boundaries and tribal limits. —I therefore don T t see 1 any objection to our announcing that the visit of the geologists is primarily to map out the countryside in conjunction with us which is an i essential preliminary to any detailed exploration for oil. T think therefore that a 'Uitical Officer should accompany them. To the best of my kno-led e we have not one single i detailed map of that pert of the world and if it is humanly possible would most strongly recommenttthat we obtain aerial photographs at a very early date and that copies are available to the 0. anc y am sure the Americans already have them. They would be invaluable if we were compelled to settle boundaries in the near future which appears quite probable. To summarise. (a) . !,T e should call the $av T asim bluff and in particular that of dhaikh Sultan bin daqr of Sharjah. I think v;e should lose face if we did not and T see no reason to fear repercussions over the aerodrome. (b) . T,r e should give Shaikh dultan a definite date for giving the Company written permission to visit the Jabal Faiyah, and a warning that if tie cannot so v.'ithin that time he will be con sidered to have witheld unreasonably or been x unable to obtain such permission and that ttie provisions of Article 10 of the Political Agreement will be held to apply. T7 e will not be able to comply. (c) . ’ r e should then - on arrival of the geologists in Sharjah (they should stay at the Fort and not contact shaikh S Itan cr advertise their presence at all) - coni-ct Shaikh ’fohd. in Ali and having fixed with him for thier visit to the Jabal Fsiyah end after their departure inform Shaikhtl * °ultrn fs in parr above. The visit has then been arranged and the geologists are in the Jabal Faiyeh arer dnd Thaikh Pultan vill have been shorn up in his true light as petty ruler Hiose influence does not extend beyond his ovn date gardens C.c^-£^- * , r a i-ekbributtiaer^s-'-nutr• 'T-t'- N ; (^d). T rccoainend a Political officer accanipanies the Geologists and the object of the party is not kept secret - everyone knovs we shall have to map the country one day. (ed. T recommend an aerial survey and maps are made available very early v' &lt; z / ■&gt; !• I agree with Captain Bird that the chances of the Sheikh of Sharjah being able to arrange the entry into the JabaL Faiyah area are very remote. I also agree that, in the existing circumstances, no useful purpose .would be served by trying to arrange matters between Sheikh Sultan and Sheikh Mohd. or soliciting an intervention by Sheikh Khalid of Kalba or Sheikh Rashid of Ajman. 2. It is now up to P.C.L. to prefer an appeal to us under clause 10 of the political Agreement on the grounds unreasonably that the Sheikh is imrxacxaQcaaaxk&amp;y withholding permission for them to enter the Jabal Faiyah area. We could then proceed as suggested by Captain Bird. 3. If oil is found in the Jabal Faiyah area I think that we should seriously consider the question of a separate agreement with Shaikh Mohd. In my opinion we should also delete Provision C of the Schedule to the P.C.L.-Sharjah Agreement and reduce the agreed payments but only if oil is found. If no oil is found no useful purpose would be served by creating what would be a precedent which should almost certainly have repercussions elsewhere on the Trucial Coast. In any case our direct approach to the Beni Qitab as suggested by Capt. Bird is tantamount to declaring that we do not recognize Sharjah’s sovereignty over the Jabal Faiyah area. 4. With reference to S.7 I suggest that we reply briefly saying that the recent dispute over Ghanadhah is not likely to interfere with the movements of the P.C.L. geologists. Should anything develope which is likely to affect them they will be duly informed. $*7 . P.

The correspondence is principally between the Residency Agent at Sharjah, the Political Officer of the Trucial Coast, also at Sharjah, the Political Agent at Bahrain, representatives of Petroleum Concessions Limited and Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited, the India Office, the rulers of Sharjah, Ras al Khaimah [Ra's al-Khaymah], and Abu Dhabi, as well as the leaders of a number of more minor tribes.The correspondence covers the arrangements for, and the progress of, survey work carried out by the company during the winters of 1945/46, 1946/47, and 1947/48, in the vicinities of Jabal Faiyah and Buraimi [Al-Buraymī], including a reconnaissance trip through Wadi al Gor. Contained in the file are regular updates on the progress of the surveys sent by company representatives to either the Residency Agent or the Political Officer at Sharjah.Matters of a political nature were referred by the company to the Residency Agent or the Political Officer, and the following issues are covered within the file:numerous incidents of resistance from local Bedouin inhabitants, usually triggered by transgression of tribal boundaries;pay arrangements for guards and labourers, including a strike by workers in October 1946;the employment of non-British subjects (namely Americans);tribal and territorial allegiances that impacted on the work of the surveyors.Folio 102 is a sketch map of the area explored around Ajman [‘Ajmān] and Umm al Qaiwain [Umm al Qaywayn].Folios 211-232 are internal office notes, including extracts from the oil concession agreement with Shaikh Sultan II bin Saqr of Sharjah [Sulṭān II bin Saqr Āl Qāsimī].</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Abu Dhabi, Āl Nahyān dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Oil Operations</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Sharjah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Jabal Faiyah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Buraimi</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Wadi Al Gor</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Geological surveying</topic></subject><subject><topic>Labour disputes</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Ra's al-Khaymah</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Sharjah</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Abu Dhabi</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000130#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
