Shaikh Sultan bin Salim,Ruler of Has al Khaimah arrived at Sharjah by car on Thursday evening the 27th August 1936 and put up with Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, Ruler of Sharjah. 3. On Saturday morning the 29th August 1956, he .1 went to Dubai and spent the whole day with Shaikh Sa'id bin l&amp;aJstum, O.B.E., Ruler of Dubai. He inquired from Shaikh Sa f id bin Maktum if he had signed the Oil Concession and advised him not to give his final decision or sign it until he consulted all the Trucial Shaikhs. Shaikh Sa f id ssM reminded Shaikh Sultan bin Salim of his signing the option agreement and also his cousin the Shaikh of Sharjah without consulting him and aaid that he saw no reason why he should consult them in his,own internal affairs# Shaikh Sultan bin s alim said that it was in the interest of all of them that they should consult each other and stand firm in all matters, and that they should give a Joint decision about oil and that they should not give a blind &gt; o undertaking in regard to responsibility for the protection of the employees and property of the Company. He warned Shaikh Sa'id not to run the risk of giving the undertaking asked for by the Government lest he may have to pay may Rs.50,000/- for the life of one of the employees who/be insured for a large sum of money. He advised Shaikh Sa T id bin Maktum to keep the matter pending for three months. Shaikh Sa'id said that he consulted his own people who have /have accepted the terms of the oil concession and that he was not bound by any outside opinion. In the evening Shaikh Sultan bin Salim crossed over to Daira quarters and visited Miihaminad bin Ahmad bin Dalmuk, father-in-law of Shaikh Sa'ids daughter, and after coffee ; he went to the house of one T Abdul 'Aziz an jNajdi, where Shaikh Mani 1 , cousin of the Ruler of Dubai went to see him and had a long talk with him during the night and also the next morning. Shaikh Mani* is against the grant of the Dubai oil concession on the present terms. the 30th August 1936., 4. On Sunday evening/shaikh Sultan bin Salim returned from Dubai and after staying about an hour with Shaikh Sutlan bin Saqr of Sharjah, he went to Khan Sahib Husain bin Hasan ! Amad in his house and had a private talk with him for about an hour. He inquired from Khan Sahib Husain about Kalba and, according to Husain, he told him (Shaikh Sultan bin Salim) that the matter is considered as settled. Shaikh Sultan bin Salim then went to Salim bin Khamis(maternal uncle cf the Shaikh of Sharjah) and at about 11 o*clock left in his motor lorry for Ras al Khaimah. I have not been able to discove what other talks ttey he had with Khan Sahib Husain,but on the 31st Morning, I came to know that Khan Sahib Husain had arranged to go to ^as al Khaimah with Shaikh Sultan bin fecilm Saqr, Ruler of Sharjah on Saturday the 5th September 1936 or after him within a day or two. Today I asked Husain if he has any intention of going to m Ras al Khaimah and he replied abigmously that he might go in his car with the Shaikh on Saturday or go to Abu Masa Island and then to Ras al Khaimah or to Ras al Khaimah and then to Abu Musa, but that he was sending his cousin Muhammad bin Rajab by car to visit Muhammad bin 1 Abdul 'Aziz, the clerk of the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah who is his friend.

I paid the sum of fis,500/- to the Residency Agent to be paid to the Haji on his arriving at Sharjah for his assistance during the Kalba negotiation, £• The Residency Agent had been expecting Haji Ahmad to arrive any day and had therefore taken no action on my telegram instructing him to discover to whom the Shaikh of Kalba wished his monthly payment for air facilities to be paid to. I handed over Bs.400/- for the month ending September 28th and told the Residency Agent not to wait for Haji Ahmad but to write and ask the Shaikh to state in writing to wMm the money should be paid and pay it to that person obtaining his receipt. 3. I paid Bs.200/- to Khan Sahib Hussain for his assistance in the Kalba negotiation and he seemed satisfi^ although the Residency Agent thought that he was expecting more. 4. No message had been received from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi who is at Braimi attending his brother's wedding. I have no doubt that if he can he will attend the reception of Shaikhs on the Comrriander-in-Chief 1 s visit. The Residency Agent was most anxious for the Shaikh of Dubai to leave the 'Norfolk' first and not Abu Dhabi as instructed by the Resident. He informed me that on the last visit the Shaikh of Dubai left first followed by Abu Dhabi and also pointed out that Dubai was an officer of the British Empire and a much older man. I have agreed to his request and informed the Resident by wire and the Senior Naval Officer by letter. (b)~ 2 - (b) Apparently it has been customary for the Shaikh of Dubai to make a present to the Admiral and his flagship and I sanctioned the presentation on this occasion informing the Resident and Senior Naval Officer. Mr. Packer is expected to be back by the middle of this month. The house that he has rented from the Shaikh of Dubai has been extensively repaired and is ready for occupation. Reports state that the pearl crop has been good here this year and poor in Bahrain. I questioned the Residency Agent about the question of Shihuk dhows and he has made careful enquiries and find that they do not trade with this part of the world in fact they do not ceme round Rus al Jibal. He has written a letter which will be forwarded in the near future. I am to expect a report on the arms trade in the near future. This is the long expected report.© »IIP30/19/Air 0.

I &gt;C signed the Agreement with him and obtained from him a copy of the Treaty Book and the letters connected to it. I agreed that conceasions for me would be similar to those of the shaikhs who are in truce with the Government, but there are some points to which I beg to draw your attention, firstly arms that have been allowed to me are 11 rifles which are insufficient to meet the need. We know better our situation and entertained a great hope for arms. My friend Ahmad bin Hasan informed me that when you met him at Sharjah you promised him sufficient arms. Secondly there has been hesitation in his admission to me about the firing of guns allowed to the Shaikhs by the Government. Thirdly mention has been mde for our assistance in case anybody transgressing on us or pressing us in connection with the aerodrome the Government will help us. Transgressor who will press me naturally will not admit that he is going to harm me as I have allowed the Government an aerodrome but will take recourse to something else. I hope help from the Government materially and ideally according to requirements. I resolved to overlook (?abrogate) the Agreement on account of these points, but out of regard to Your Honour and in order to preserve the friendly relations and because I did not like to be in fault before the Government, I acceded to your /-2- your request and I deem it necessary to inform you in this connection, I request you to let me have a reply* Usual Ending.Note of discussions by tke Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the 22nd October 193S.

As soon as H.M.S.Bideford arrived at Urn al Qaiwain bothe the Shaikh, who was accompanied by his elder brother, «Ali, and myself went on board. Afteraa long discussion, the Shaikh asked the Captain about the period required to complete the work to which he replied 27 days. The Captain also said to the Shaikh that after working for 17 days he will go to Kuwait for the Celebrations and then return after ten days and finish the work, ihis aroused the Shaikh's suspicions and he said that he was not going to allow that and that it would be better if the matter is left for some other time. After much discussions, I was able to convince the Shaikh that he should allow the survey now and the Shaikh agreed to extend the period from 10 to 15 days to stay in the Khaur on condition that they should leave after that date. The Captain accepted this proposal by the Shaikh and he gave him a letter to this effect. In the inning the Captain returned the Shaikh's visit and I hired a boat for ^s.8/- per day. The boat was first inspected by the Navigating Officer and when he said that it was suitable for the party I hired it for them. After every thing was arranged 1 returned to Sharjah.

Your telegram of 21st April T/48. I think the difficulties are due partly to the sudden demand for survey which has left little time to explain matters to the Shaikh and to his relatives, and partly to the fact that suspicions have been aroused by Bideford wishing to go off to Kuwait in the middle. Also as long as we have to request Shaikhs for facilities we are unfortunately open to this kind of ^havering' 1 • 2. In the case of Yas Island the thing which upset the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi and others was that we asked for a facility and when it was refused proceeded to install it. 3. I venture to suggest that in the first instance Residency Agent should convey a message from you explaining that such a survey cannot be done in 15 days but that you rely upon Shaikh to give such time as is necessary, and that survey will be completed with as little delay as possible.

At 5 p.m. Group Captain W.B.Callaway called on the Shaikh and discussed the question of moving the petrol dhow to a position off Mu'airidh village to the North East of the town. The Shaikh said that he was ready to help the Hoyal Air Force in any manner he could, but that the new position selected will interfere with the traffic of dhows and renders the petrol to a great danger, the risk of which he does not want to take© After short discussion he suggested that the petrol dhow should be kept on the other side of the creek as close to the shore as possible so as to keep it away from the dhows traffic and to enable the guards on shore to watch her properly. He said that about three years ago a sailing boat dashed against the petrol dhow owing to the wind and current. That as seon as the guard saw that^he thought that they were going to steal from the petrol and shouted at them to keep away^but they were busy to keep her away and did not listen to him, as a result of which he fired at them and wounded one of the crew which made the Shaikh to pay half of his blood money as compen^ationo ; 3* She Shaikh requested Group Captain Callaway to think of some more safe means which would save him from responsibilliy wh ich hk promised to think of© RBSiDi^nCfmENr SHAR&lt;3AHX I; y w| Telegram From To repeat ed No. - 345 G.

Umm al Qaiwain survey. I have been informed by Political Agent Bahrain that Residency Agent bharjah who is at Umm al Qaiwain with BIDEFORD reports that Shaikh agreed after some difficulty to survey, but ordered that survey party should not repeat not carry on stay more than fifteen days. Shaikh's attitude was somewhat influenced by shortness of notice which had to be given him by Political Agent Bahrain though this was inevitable Under my orders Political Agent Bahrain informed Shaikh through Residency Agent that my instructions were that survey party would stay in Umm al Qaiwain for as long as it was necessary for them to complete their survey but that it would be carried out with as little delay as possible. Umm al Qilvtaln were informed of this. To this Shaikh has replied he could not allow survey party to stay more than fifteen days owing to opposition of his relatives and notables. A firm attitude on our part should assist Shaikh to overcome this opposition. 4. Apart from completion of survey in a thorough manner there is the important principle in my opinion that we cannot allow any Shaikh to dictate to us how long H.M. Ships shall stay in his port or how long important work which is being carried out by His Majesty's Navy shall last. I have instructed Political Agent to repeat my message to the Shaikh and inform the latter that I will hold him and his people responsible for- 2 - d. responsible for any untoward Incident happening to the survey party through the action of his people. 5. I suggest therefore that (a) if survey is not finished in the fifteen days as a show of force a second sloop be sent to Umm al Walwain (b) that if it appears to the Officer Commanding Bideford^ who will be in close touch with the Residency Agent^ that there is a risk of the survey party being molested they should be withdrawn to sloop (c) I would then propose informing the Shaikh that until the survey is completed (l) certain local measures will be put in force against him and his people (2) if these local measures do not have the requisite effect I would then inform the Shaikh that a sloop will be stationed outside Umm-al-Qaiwain and none of his dhows will be permitted to leave for pearling or other purposes. Pearling season begins in latter half of May. 6. Course (l) above I can put into effect on my own responsibility and will not require any action by sloops. For (2) I shall have to obtain the sanction of His Majesty's Government. I think however that they will agree to this course of action since they sanctioned a similar one in connection with obtaining of an facilities at Abu Dhabi about two years-ago vide my telegram No.T/166 of June 4th 1935 to the Senior Officer Persian Gulf and connected correspondence. Any action by sloops can be arranged so as not to interfere with the Coronation celebrations. 7. I understand that Admiralty attach considerable importance to carrying out of the survey and beyond this I am strongly of opinion that a question of principle has arisen which affects our prestige on the A.rab coast. I trust there fore that you will be able to concur in the courses of action I suggest and would be grateful of an urgent reply. 8. If the survey can be completed in 15 days above courses of action will not have to be carried out but it would be as well to have our plans cut and dried now in case of eventualities. - RESIDENT -i a I'!

DIBAI - Petrol dhowCOPY* S•11004/2« Air Headquarters 9 British Forces in Iraq, Hinaidi, IRAQ. 3rd April, 1937• Sir, Dibai Petrol Dhow * I have the honour to inform you that I have recently- reviewed the question of maintaining R.A.F. fuel and oil at Dibai, and I have come to the conclusion that it is no longer necessary or economical to keep a stock at this place* 2. When No.203 (F.B.) Squadron visited Dibai in December last year, after an absence of nearly a year at Aden, th^r found that the dhow was leaking badly and it had to be beached. The consequent damage done by the salt water amounted to a loss of 224 tins of petrol. 3. With better refuelling arrangements at Has al Khaimah, only 50 miles up the coast, flying boats now prefer to refuel there, and the stock at Dibai is not turned over frequently enough to ensure against deterioration. 4. If flying boats require fuel at Dibai, they can easily obtain it by signalling Sharjah beforehand, and it can be brought down by road, only a distance of 7 miles. 5. I note in clause 1 of the agreement between the R.A.F. and the Shaikh that the latter is only bound to provide a suitable craft, although the obligation to keep it in a satis factory state of repair might be implied. I should appreciate your views as to whether the bad state of repair of the dhow would be sufficient grounds for terminating the agreement, which still has approximately three more years to run. A'^ ^ same / The Hon ! ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, The Residency, Btshire.time, I am aware that such a course might antagonise the Shailch and thus make future negotiations difficult and, in regard to this, I have in mind the still unsettled question of an alighting area on the Trucial Coast for the Imperial Airways flying boats.

In reply to my demand the Shaikh, who was alone, stated that he would never refuse the requests of His Majesty 1 s Government but that he was unable to act without consulting his advisers. It was clear that the Shaikh was speaking the truth^and that he was afraid of the consequences of acting without their consent. While he is reputed to be one of the strongest rulers on the Coast in internal affairs he has to act on the advice of his leading men and relatives in external matters. I suggested that he should collect his advisers at once and that the matter could be put to them there and then. He was unwilling to do this and as I considered that he should have either adopted my suggestion of calling his council or made a decision himself I informed him that his travel papers would within two days I would have to inform the Honourable the Political Resident and stronger measures would in all probability be introduced.
