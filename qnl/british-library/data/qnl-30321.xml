My dear Laithwaite, Confirming my telephone conversation of this morning, the D.D.C.A. has sent D.D.O.I. a minute which reads as follows •- “Air Commodore Fletcher, Imperial Airways Ltd., has today ’phoned to me to say that they are anxious after all that SHINAS should he made available as ar emergency landing ground for their pilots particulg ly on the flights from East to West. In some cases aircraft had only been able to make Shargah from Gwadar with a few minutes petrol left in the jtfrat tanks. Will you please, therefore, as a matter of urgency ask the India Office to geff the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to have thr ground at Shinas made available for use in emergency.* 1 2. Would you please, let us know what action it is possible to take to hasten provision of this emergency landing ground as Imperial Airways now seem to have changed their mind as to its necessity.

S.W. 1 P.Z.4162/33 14th July 1933 v V Dear Bertram, You will have seen Kerhy*s letter of 14th July, No. S.31466, about the provision of an emergency landing ground at Shinas. We will take this question up at once. I write fcx at this stage only to say that, as you will remember, Shinas was previously rejected on the ground that it was too far south and that its employment would involve too great a diversion from the normal route. As you know, we see strong objection here (and the Foreign Office and Admiralty have in the past, I think, shared our view) to any flights by Imperial Airways across the base of the Mussandim Peninsula from Shinafc, etc., to Shargah; and as a result of interdepartmental discussion it was, I think, agreed last year that exception need not be taken to flights across the tip of the Peninsula from Ras-al-Khaimah to Dibba; but flights mouth of a line drawn between those points should not be allowed. I assume there is no question of any alteration as regards this, but we should be glad to if you would confimm our assumption. 2* I am sending copies of this letter to Warner at the Foreign Office and Moore at the Admiralt; Yours sincerely 2* 0.

SH1NAS LANDING GROUND. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegram No.599 dated 24th July, 1933 on the above subject. 2. As I informed you in my signal A.610 dated 28th July, 1933, the arrangements for marking out Shinas may be deferred until Major Bremner is back from Karachi and probably you will consider it advisable to wait until the Sultan has confirmed the Muscat Council’s decision before taking any action. 3* I regret that I omitted to include Shinas in the list of air facilities enclosed with my letter S.10604 dated 13th July, 1933. I am of the opinion that Shinas landing ground may possibly be useful to Imperial Airways* aircraft should they run short of petrol on the Gwadur - Sharjah section of their route and it also might be useful for our own aircraft when proceeding from Sharjah - Ras al Khaimah to Muscat, besides having the advantage of getting the inhabitants used to movements of aircraft. 4. I do not think the usefulness of this landing ground justifies any expense with the exception of marking it out, and so I propose to place it in Category ’C*. 5. If you will be so good as to inform me when Bremner is available and the Sultan has confirmed the Council* decision, I will arrange for landplanes to pick up Bremner and carry out temporary marking5which will be completed later by the Chief Engineer.

In view of the above and the fact that the Council have already issued provisional permission for the landing ground, it would appear expedient to go ahead with the work. To delay matters indefinitely against the Sultan's problematic uate of return might prove highly inconvenient to the Royal Air Porce authorities, whilst the lack of an emergency ground might involve serious danger to aeroplanes in distress. 3 . as it will be necessary lor me to tour the hatinah coast in the autumn it eould so be arranged for my arrival at Shinas to coincide with a date suitable to the Royal Air Force. 4 .

At the same time I think the existince of unis landing ground at dhinas whould prove extremely useful to your Xi ighness as its effects on the people of the Batinah should be great, in the eveht of trouble aeroplanes can land at chinas and demonstrate over affected area. 7. I think that the Bhinas landing ground, that at Shagha J -sland (instead of Masirah) and the Murbat recon naissance are the xkk aerial matters to which lour highness refers in your letter as these are the only three matters which I have applied to the Council.Jc6 ‘ * - 2 - Th« whola of tha ground wara duly lerallad and ruta wara fillad.

Dear Saiyid Hamad, I have to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your letter of 4th December enclosing me a map of the Shinas landing ground. 2, It is not quite clear to me from the Wall’s map as to the areas he has cleared of bushes and levelled. I have therefore marked on the map in red pencil the portions which it is essential to clear of bushes and to make level. 3 , i trust that by now the Wall will have put down the white marks as a few days ago when the flying boat passed over Shinas they could not see any and in the event of an aeroplane being forced to land there it is essential to have these marks clearly visible. 4, I am most grateful to ycu for your efforts on x? behalf of getting this work completed. 5, With my best wishes.
