Sir, I beg to state that my son named Salam about seven years ago went with his mother to Bahrain. His mother died at Bahrain about six months hence, and he is left now in the care of his maternal uncle Haji Mohammed el Shaikh Ahmed al Asfoor, residing at Shakhora. Four months ago I sent a letter to a friend of mine at Bahrain reguesting him to send my son Salam to Basra to join me. He, in reply has stated that necessary money for his journey and passport expenses be sent to him for the purpose. As I fear that my son will not be eent even if I send the money for his expenses, I beg of you to kindly ask the British Consul at Bahrain to arrange to issue passport to my son and to send him to Basra. I am ready to defray all expenses on the arrival of i son.

Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge your letter No.10129 of the 19 th July 19^6 regarding the release from custody of Mehdi ^ahraini, son of Haji Ashoor bin Haji Mohammed Ashoor, a subject of the Bhaikh of Bahrain. I now learn from Mehdi Bahraini that on the 28th June he was placed in police custody at Kut-al-Zen and taken to Seebah and detained there until the JOth June. He was then brought from Seebah to •^shar where he was taken from place to place, owing to the necessity for consultation with the Inspector of Police, Seebah, whose whereabouts were known to be in Ashar. detention under police custody at Ashar was later ordered by the Commandant of Police, Ashar. On the 1 st July Mehdi Bahraini was handcuffed and under escort sent to Diwaniyah. There he was detained in prison until the morning of the 11 th July and arraigned before the court. After an investigation by the judge (an investigation which, ^ from the information at my disposal, could only have taken a few moments) he was told that he could leave. He left Diwaniyah on the 11 th July and arrived at Basra on the following day. I am sure you will agree that such delay, unnecessary hardship and the accompanying inconvenience cannot in this case be overlooked, particularly as Mehdi Bahraini was never aware of the charge under which he was placed under police custody and further, The Mutasarrif, that/ Basra Liwa.- 2 - that a summary investigation which involved only particulars regarding his name, parents, nationality, and the number of times he has visited Iraq, does not under the circumstances, warrant the treatment to which he was subjected.

The Mutasarrifiyeh, Basra Liwa, present their compliments to the British Consulate, Basra, and with reference to their (Consulate's) Memorandum No.1661 of the 15th September 1956 have the honour to inform them that enquiries made with regard to Sayid Jaffer-al Sayid Moosa have elicited that he was born in 1916 and is residing in Kibasi-al-Kabix village, and is registered in the Iraqi census books as an Iraqi A.rab. niere is nothing whatever to prove his cliam for a foreign nationality a^d that even at the time of his preliminary examination he did not ^ * claim his foreign nationality. It was only at the time of his final examination before the medical board that he stated that he was a Bahraini national, and that before that he had never made a claim for a foreign nationality. His father and his family consisting of thirteen male and eight female$ members are registered in the Iraqi Census records as Iraqis, and no one of them at the time of general registration did put in a claim for any srecial nationality. His brother, named Jaber, who was born in 1915 and who is liable for service to the flag has also not claimed any foreign nationality. Tinder the circumstances the person in question Sayid Jabbar was medically examined because he was an Iraqi national, and as such is liable for comnulsory service to the flag; and has no family to sunnort. In view o p the above and in comnliance with the existing regulations the Mutasarrif iyeh should be glad if the Consulate would nlease inform Sayid Jaffar to submit an annlication to the Mutasarrifiyel giving reasons against the registration so that necessary investigations be made with regard to his nationality and the case dealt with on its merits.
