The orders cover a range of roles and aspects of BAPCO’s operations: instructions for sentries at refinery gates; checks on motor and goods vehicles coming into and out of the refinery; instructions for motor patrols; instructions for motorcycle patrols (left blank as a result of a lack of motorcycles); orders for the officer-in-charge of the field, including checks for sabotage of wells, pipelines and tanks; standing orders for the officer-in-charge of the refinery; orders for
                           naturguards; orders for the second shift foreman; instructions for security personnel at Sitrah terminal, Sitrah pier, Sitrah wharf. Some pages of the standing orders are heavily annotated in pencil, presumably by Agency staff or by the Agent himself, with comments and questions relating to specific aspects of the standing orders.Also in the file is a letter (ff 2-4) from the Secretary of the Committee of Internal Refinery Defence, dated 25 September 1939, containing twelve proposals to improve security and reduce the need for labourers (referred to as ‘coolies’) to move around the refinery site unattended, and a letter (ff 69-71) from Max Weston Thornberg, Vice President of BAPCO, to Weightman, setting out BAPCO’s company policy towards the defence of its sites in Bahrain during ‘the existing state of emergency’.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company, Chief Local Representative</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company, Vice-President</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Sitrah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum industry</topic></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum refineries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Security of property</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00002d#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00002d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
